      I am feeling much better.  I believe the combination of allergies, from the new hotel with dirt roads and lots of trees, and eating some bad lettuce, I was not feeling well on Friday.  Luckily though.  I found some allergy pills and got lots of sleep this weekend, so now I feel like a million CFA [the currency here].    As for the weekend, it was nice and relaxing.  Actually today is still the weekend.  There is no work on Mondays, but we decided to come in.  Saturday, when I started to feel better, we went to the IT coordinators house for a traditional Gabonese dinner.  It was all fish and not very good.  I went in hungry and came home even hungrier.  There something about seeing the fish's tail in the stew that is not appetizing.  It was fun though.  Finally getting out and seeing something other than the walls in my apartment.  We get our car tomorrow, so we won't be limited as much with where we go.  We don't like calling the driver all the time, even though he's on call 24 hours a day, so when we get the car, we will do more.    Yesterday, was Gabon independence day.  Marathon has a cabana on the beach and we all went to a BBQ to celebrate.  It was nice out and the sound of the waves made me want to live on the coast.  The weird part was that they brought out a whole goat that had been BBQ'd.  I mean the only thing missing was the head, and you had to cut the meat off yourself.  Pretty interesting.    As a whole, I'm beginning to get more comfortable and once I got these allergies under control, I'm feeling much better.  Hopefully on Wednesday, one of the employees wife's is going to take me shopping.  She's supposed to be the best at bartering here and she said I can just tell her what I want and she'll go barter for me.  We'll see, they have some really neat stuff.

      We had a bit of excitement last night...we were moved from our nice hotel to this dump of another place due to the civil disturbances by a local lumber company.  We were moved purely as a safety precaution, and much to our belief an office politics.  As I said, the place is a dump.  Before we had a nice restaurant, safety, and an accommodating room.  I was beginning to sleep well and was relatively comfortable with the surroundings.  Now we're in a place where there's constant ladies of the night around, one lock that is from the 1920's and the food is horrible.  And our movie channel doesn't exist, so there's only CNN.  I'll be the all-knowing source for your latest headline news.    This morning I got two minutes of hot water.  Hopefully I have painted an accurate picture.  It's not horrible, but the circumstances we are in, suck.  And for some reason, our office smells like dog poop.  We're all paranoid that it's one of us.

      Last night was very interesting...the three of us auditors decided we wanted to have something other than food from our hotel for dinner.  We managed to talk our driver into picking up pizzas for all of us, including him.  So he dropped us off and we were waiting for our food with a South African who also works here at Marathon, Doug.  Doug is a medical tech on the offshore rig working 6 weeks on and 6 weeks off.  He received some phone calls while we were waiting and was told that there was civil unrest near our hotel.  Riots to be exact and that the military was blocking the roads, etc.  He was nervous cause he wasn't sure he was going to be able to make his flight in the morning.  We were worried about the driver getting back safe.  While waiting, Doug received a call from Melissa who is my contact here.  She is training someone to take over for her, having an audit and leaving in a week.  She calls him and says "I'm sick, take me to the doctor".  Apparently she is vomiting, nauseated, etc.- all malaria symptoms.  So he helicopters a test kit in to take to her, but can't go anywhere due to the drive not being back yet.  Gerard, the driver, did make it back safe, with our pizzas, so we ate and Doug called Melissa again, but she couldn't move so the malaria test was going to be taken in the morning.   We all ate, and had a beer before bed.  Well this morning, the Scotsman, Mike, called me and said he wasn't going to be at breakfast, "He couldn't get off the pot" [in a Scottish accent, which makes it quite humorous].  When I went to pick up Johnnie, he said he wasn't going to eat and that he was "sitting" down at 3 am.  So I go to breakfast alone and am having some granola and coffee when my tummy grumbles and I have to leave breakfast early too!  While sitting there, Mike calls me again on my cell phone [work provided] and says, "Do you have any extra toilet paper?  I've used all mine.]!  Haha!  It's not really that funny, but it is!  So I say, "Mike, give me 5 min, I'll need some more then will bring the remainder down."  So I took him some TP and Pepto and took some pepto myself.  Johnnie and I are in the office and Mike stayed home.    Other than tummy, things are going well.

      Things here are going well.  It looks as though I will be swamped with work.  I am doing to job of 3 people for 4 weeks, as a team of 1 in 3 weeks.  So far though, everyone is very easy-going and laid back.   We were driving around on Sunday and saw a golf course and surf spot, so some weekend I might have to check those out.  Other plans include Gabon independence day on Sunday.  We get Friday off and possibly Monday.  Woohoo!  But that will be a bit boring so, I'm sure we'll all work.  We haven't gotten our rental car yet, so we've been driven around by a driver.  They don't want to give us a standard shift since no one knows how to drive it.  So we'll wait for an automatic.  No car has kept us grounded to the hotel and it's 5 choices on the menu, which creates boring evenings.    I didn't sleep well the last two nights, which is making me very tired.  But all in all, so far so good.  I can tell you though that it will be nice to get back home.

      Yesterday, myself and Johnnie were sitting on this outdoor porch on the second floor [which is really cool] reading, when Pete, Marathon's Security Advisor, showed up to give us a briefing on what to be aware of and lookout for.  Scary stuff.  Terrorism, crime, roadblocks, etc.  Got me really nervous to have to drive.  They tell me that I'm going to have to learn how to drive a standard shift in this traffic, which has no lanes, just a free for all.  I'm thinking "Oh great!"  Pete took us to a local spot on the beach, with a great view and we did what I do best, drink beer and eat.  We ate these huge gambas, which are prawns/shrimp that are about the size of my fist.  Their good!    Pete told us to look out for "ladies of the night" outside our hotel and said I was a prime target cause I'm young.  I told Mike and Johnnie that I plan on locking myself in my room after dark.    It gets dark here about 6:20 at night and so far the weather has been perfect.  Basically all we've done is sit around our rooms, watching "Movie Madness", which is the only English speaking channel, playing only movies, which is sort of nice.  I guess we get CNN too.  Yesterday, we spent drinking and eating.  Apparently they take 2 and half hour lunches here.  I think I'll have no problem getting used to that.  :)    As for now we have to get started working. We are 5 hours ahead.

      It's official!  I've got a new job.  I'll be a Systems Audit Specialist with  urlLink CapitalSource , Inc.  CS is a commercial lending company and is a smaller, growing up-start.  I'm really excited.  It's got all the perks of the 1990's, including a gym, plasma TVs, catered lunch, etc.  I've been hired to help build the Audit Department from scratch as they've just went public.  It will be a lot of work, but is a great opportunity for me.    That means that  urlLink Bogeyputts  has been put on the back burner.  It's not over, but I will be looking for some energetic and passionate individuals with a multitude of talents to take a chance and try to turn this into the hub for the next generation of golfer.

      My dream.  A golf club for us 20-somethings who love the game, but hate the stuffiness and arrogance that comes with it.  I have devised a plan for a golf club where fun, style, comfort, leisure, culture, and dining are welcome and encouraged.  It's name, Bogeyputts Golf Course.  It's not a club, but rather a challenging course with first class food and drink, clothing and atmosphere.  It's the sister company and reflection of  urlLink bogeyputts.com .  To start, it should be located in a sunny and warm state [e.g. Arizona, New Mexico, Florida], where there is more to do than just golf and that is not a retirement community.  We want nature available for outdoor persuits such as kayaking, surfing and hiking.  There should be vintage clothing stores and mom 'n pop diners and coffee houses and hole-in-the-wall pub near by.  The course will be a championship style course with varying degrees of difficulty based on the choice of tees.  Women, minorities, kids and men will all be welcome to play at anytime, but please remember to allow faster players to play through.  That's just annoying people.  I digress.  Breath taking views, crisp green grass and well-manicured greens are a necessity.  There shall be no "links-style", but rather each hole will be a new and unique challenge.  A large practice area will be available for hitting range balls and we will allow Happy Gilmore-ing, but only on the range.  As this club is meant to enjoy the finer things, we also want to encourage improvement in your game, so a short game practice facility is required reading.  66% of your shots come from the short game, so all are encouraged to work on the flop shot there.  Clubhouse.  Consider this our version of a pub, cigar lounge, coffee shop, micro-brew, mom n' pop diner and Jamie Oliver's "Fifteen" all put in a tumbler, shaken and poured into a historic structure.  We emphasize what everyone wants.  We're looking to entertain people even when they aren't golfing.  This is a hangout.  It won't be unusual to see people stuck in the clubhouse for late night benders, or to stop by at lunch for one of my famous burgers or chili.  We'll be offering fresh brewed coffee and beers [lager, amber and stout].  Hot wings are a must, and we'll feature other great dishes that we discover from other places.  We'll do our best to imitate the chipotle burrito, in n out burger, tony packos sausage, and ben's chili bowl half-smoke.  The pro-shop will only stock the finest meats [equipment] and cheeses [apparell].  On our website, we try to be the underground of golf, meaning we know the next big thing before anyone else does.  In our shop, we will provide products that are from the underground, as well as proven staples in the golf industry.

      It's 11:15 and I didn't eat enough for breakfast and all I can think about is the fun places I've eaten in my day.  I'm only 24, but have been fortunate enough to travel quite a bit.  When traveling I try to eat at those mom and pop/hole in the wall places that have a unique dish or atmosphere.  A certain ambiance if you will.  So here's my list of good food/places:   Washington DC   urlLink Ben's Chilli Bowl  -- Bill Cosby's favorite is the half smoked, me too.     urlLink Findlay, Ohio    urlLink Olers  -- looks like an armpit, but tastes like heaven in Mexico  urlLink Wilson  -- Dave Thomas of Wendy's fame stole the square hamburger patties from this place, plus there's a special way to order or you get in trouble  urlLink Tony Packos  -- it's in Toledo and has great hungarian sausages and hot pickles and peppers . urlLink Dietsch Bros  -- cookies and cream shakes, mmmmm.   Franchises   urlLink Chipotle  -- I love me some body pillow burritos.  Papa's franchises in Texas -- jalepano and cheese stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon!   Los Angeles, California   urlLink In-n-out burger  -- Aces!     London, UK   urlLink 15  -- I have a man crush on  urlLink Jamie Oliver !

      First, let's begin with a bit of an update.  Liz [girlfriend] and I recently began looking for a home to live to buy.  We found on, made an offer, got the offer accepted, and were scheduled to close on the 25th.  On the 24th, I'm frantically transferring and wiring money to different accounts for closing payment, and then plan to get a cashiers check made on the way home.  Well in DC, the banks close at 4 and I was unaware of this.  I begin to panic as the banks don't open until 9 and we are scheduled to close at 9:15 am.  While driving home, stressing and panicing, I am not really paying much attention to the road, when BOOM!, I rear end a truck!  Everyone is safe, his car is not damaged, but mine is totaled.  After my car gets towed away, and the police are done giving me a ticket [adding insult to injury], I walk home because this only happens an hour away from home.  I try to use my new palm/cell phone only to find that it is broken with a "fatal error" reading.  I can't call Liz, my insurance, towing or my parents.  Liz arrives and phones are available and in use.  The next morning we wake up and run to the bank, get the check and head to sign our papers...only to find the seller isn't showing up!  Who does this!?  He's making a ton of money on the sale and he doesn't show!  They call him and he says he'll be there.  We leave and are called moments later to state we are in posession of the house.  We spend the afternoon packing and fixing my cell phone.   Next morning, I find out my dad is driving out a car for us to use in the mean time, and Liz drops me off at work.  All goes well [that can] at work, except that the Director tells me that I am most likely not going to have a job anymore.  Bummer.  It's now 5 pm and all I want is dinner.  I go to open the front door and I am unable to move it.  One of the screws has lodged itself into the door.  I call the locksmith, landlord and Liz to come.  Two and a half hours later, all is well and we are trying to thaw out and are having people pick up a bed.    So my dad arrives on Friday and we spend the night packing.  Saturday the movers come and I send my dad and Liz to buy a car.  The end up trading in her Miata [yippie!!] and get an SUV [nifty!!].  The move goes well and we take my dad to the airport on Sunday morning.  We've been making some great progress with our unpacking and the place is looking nice.    Now, time to find a second car...

      Last night, Liz and I went the the  urlLink guster  rufus, and ben folds show at  urlLink Wolftrap .  I put guster first, because they are the reason we went to the show.   Rufus Wainwright  was good,  Ben  was okay - we left a bit early.  Now back to guster.  Guster, as always, put on an awesome show.  I've seen these guys 5 times now and this was the first outdoor show I've been to of theirs.  I was a bit concerned about the intimacy of the show, but the Gusbus did not disappoint.  They played two songs I think are new and stuck to the more recent hits of "Lost and Gone Forever" and " Keep It Together ".  I would love to be able to put together my own playlist for their concert.    Now, on to more important things...Guster needs a 4th member.  Joe, the "4th member of Guster", needs to stay.  I love that guy.  He's creating his own following of sorts.  When he played the harmonica during "Backyard", the crowd went bananas.  Why not call your band, Gusters?  Oh here's a picture from the White House Press Photographers ball, Liz invited me to attend. Just trying to show that I know people in high places.  I plan to do some reverse blogging here to document my entire life.    urlLink RUMSFELDsend.jpg

Sure, there has been Maximum Golf, Fringe golf and Schwing magazine, but we're different.  We make sense and know not to spend too much damn money.  So be on the look out.

      Oprah-  I need 3mm dollars.  I figure that is the amount that I need to retire and begin living the life I TRULY want to live.  As of now, I have a great job, own a house with my girlfriend and am quite successful for 24 years old; however, I feel like there is so much more I can do with my life and I don't want to wait to do it.  I don't want that money to have so that I can flaunt, waste and spend it on material posessions.  I want it so that I can begin living the life I choose to live.  Live where I want to live so that I can do things that TRULY matter, like spending time with family and working on my golf swing...kidding.  I'm talking "Pay it Forward".  If anyone has the financial background to make a donation of 3mm, please let me know.  Oprah, I'm calling you out.  Just donate 1% of your net worth and that will change my life.  If 1% of my net worth would change someone's life and provide them with new opportunities...I'd give it to anyone.  And if I were to have 3mm, I'd be more than happy to work to affect someone else's life.    All I'm asking is that you think it over.    Sincerely,  Josh

      I've always had a thing for style and fashion.  I also like a bevy of color.  Today, I'm wearing a bright, striped button-down shirt, similar to those found at  urlLink THOMAS PINK  and H by  urlLink Tommy Hilfiger .  I've long been a fan of these, but was always too self-conscious to wear them.  They are quite British, very colorful and offer personality to you and your work environment.  Once people get past the amount of color and new look, most think it's a good look.  I believe that these shirts will replace the tie, in terms of adding personality and flare.  The Wall Street Journal published an article about these and how the trend is moving towards this style.

      Whilst listening to the Gypsy Kings last night, I drank some cheap, but good wine - Charles Shaw.  My tastes aren't matured, so I don't have a clue what is good and if the wine has a "youthful exuberance and a hint of cedar chips", but I know the  urlLink craze  is here and I love me some two-buck chuck.  Also, it's adding a new facet to my goal of being a renaissance man.

You have to see them at an outdoor show with people you'll enjoy talking with.  We enjoyed some cheese, crackers, wine, music and conversation last night.  It was quite a nice show.  The Gypsy Kings sound much better in concert than on CDs.

      I was thinking about this the last time I played golf.  We were in Houston playing at a course where there were bag boys who picked up your clubs from the car.  At that time, we told the gents, "we'll get you when we're done", fully meaning after the round, as we were accustomed to.  But after the round they weren't around to do the cleaning of the clubs, etc that typically takes place.  We felt bad and had hoped to give them a tip because they were very nice and helpful when we arrived.    I looked up the  urlLink golf club tipping at tipping  and found some interesting etiquette, but nothing about bag boys.  I would say that a $1 might be okay in this situation; however, I am more apt to do the tipping after a round and after my clubs are clean.

      Your players are boring...for the most part.  Please don't show guys playing all weekend who have no personality.  Show me John E. Morgan getting pumped up, or don't sensor your players when they pull hook one into the drink at Doral.  I want some excitement.  When Tiger arrived, most of the excitement around him was due to how excited he would get and how much emotion he was showing.  Critics said that wasn't supposed to happen in golf.  Maybe not, but that's exactly what golf needs.  Golf is boring to most people.  Tiger, Jesper, Daly, Freddie, Annika and Wie are all enticing people to watch the game and recognize that it is exciting.  I like Vijay saying Annika doesn't belong at the Colonial.  We want rivals in this sport.  Since Tiger has begun his "major slump", the emotion from his game has vanished.  I miss that.  I'm not even his biggest fan, but when he was battling to be the best, it was great.  It brought out the personality in Duval and Tiger.    So my thoughts go to the PGA Tour.  Stop showing these boring ass guys.  Show us people who have emotion and personality.  Even if they are no names, we can all relate to someone who gets excited about a birdie and chucks his club at his bag when he bogies.

      I love documentaries and indie films.  I think they are the best way to learn and in indie films, the best way to see great acting.  A few of my favorites, which I will blog eventually, are Supersize me,  When We Were Kings ,  Bowling for Columbine [note: I don't agree with this, but is the first real blockbuster documentary and had to add it on the list].  Liz and I went to see  urlLink The Corporation  and were very pleased with it.  My first reaction was that it was extremely long and drawn out.  However, a couple highlights...   urlLink Michael Moore  - he adds some nice commentary regarding businesses and how they are solely interested in the bottom line and how ironic it is that the companies he works with hate him and his philosophies, yet they still sign him cause they know he'll bring in the $$$  Undercover marketing - people are hired to talk loudly or place products in the way of humans during their everyday life  Corporate Sponsors - two kids funding their way through college by being sponsored by a company, first union.  urlLink  Website  here.  I was very impressed by former Royal Shell CEO, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart.  He is extremely intelligent and very in tune with what the world needs.  The best scene in the movie shows he and his wife providing coffee and having a discussion with 25 protestors outside his home.  How refreshing, taking the time to listen and asking them to talk it out.  In the most intelligent moment, he said when talking with them, he found that both of them had the same desires and hopes; however, he felt he could do something about it, and the protesters felt helpless.  Another welcomed narrators is Ray Anderson, CEO of Intersol.  He personally recognized he was a thug for 20 years in the business world and then had an epiphany and realized he needed to change, reading the Ecology of Corporations.  He recognizes the benefits of capitalism and corporations, but also sees how they are a hinderence to society and too focused on profits.  This movie doesn't have the answers.  It simply provokes thought and discussion.  My thoughts are we are lacking responsibility from the corporations.  Wall street is too focused on growth. At some point the growth numbers will plateau for any corporation.  Why isn't it 'successful' by wall streets standards to remain making .20 cents a share for 20 years.  If I ran a company that stayed the same size and maintained consistant profits, I'd be thrilled. Why does it have to be .20 with a .05 increase in earnings every year?  I believe that we will see a backlash against BIG BIZ...wal-mart, microsoft and starbucks, etc.  Companies with a fresh perspective and a responsibility to the economy, environment and people will succeed.     Here's the book the movie is inspired by...

      I've been interested in finding out more about my family's [Premuda side] heritage.  My grandfather on my mom's side has done an amazing job of tracking his families lineage and I would like to do the same for my dad's side.  Read below for something I dug up thanks to Kim Premuda, my grandpa's cousin.  The following was received February 29, 1996, from Mario Premuda in Genoa, Italy. Giovanni is Mario’s son, and Luigi is Mario’s grandfather.     Dear Kim:     Giovanni requested me to write for you what I know about our family name. It is out of doubt that Premuda family originated in the island of Lussino (Losjini in croatian).   This is the smaller one in a system of two islands : Cherso and Lussino, joined by a narrow bridge of land, and located just south of Istria peninsula between Italy and Croatia. Probably the word Premuda has no meaning, as Giovanni wrote, but there are other versions which I heard from an uncle of mine who spent the last part of his life in Greece and over there died a few years ago .  According to him, it is a late latin/early venetian name: Pre-Muda, which would mean “Near to / by (Pre) - The post station where the horses were changed (Muda)”.   According to this version, the family was living on the main land and then was pushed to the islands by the barbarian hordes of Slaves and Unns.  In effect, Lussino used to be a part of the Illirian province of Roman Empire.  When the western empire fell, it remained under the eastern empire of Bisantium and later on, when it developed as a regional and then world wide power (of the then known world!), it came under the rule of the Republic of Venice.  To Venice it can be reported the strong Italian feeling of Lussino people, who spoke a venetian dialect as well as all the rest of Dalmatia did, together with a sort of croatian dialect which was spoken by inland people and by the most modest member of Lussinian community.  When Venice was “sold” by Napoleon to Austria, Lussino became a part of the Austrian Empire who lasted until 1918 (My father was born in 1907 under Austrian rule). It fought then its being part of Italy against the pressure of Great Britain and France who planned a larger Yugoslavia.   My father died in 1941, when I was two, in an Italian submarine. On being a comparatively small island the cradle of the family, it was pretty easy for some relatives of ours who had Premuda’s blood and a good inclination to, to trace our ancestry back to the late 15th century.  I am told that an aunt of mine, Letizia, who married a brother of my father, and now lives at Trieste has a very complete lineage tree. The one I have, which concerns my branch, goes back to a Giovanni Premuda who, in the year 1655, used to be “Padrone di Legni a Cabotaggio” which means “enabled to be captain within the limits of Mediterranean Sea”.  The son of his son Matteo, Antonio Premuda, was an admiral of the Venetian navy during the war of Tunis of 1765 and was later the first Lussinian captain to sail with a brick to London. From then on the Premudas were Captains and Shipowners.  Owned by a Premuda was the first steamer sailing in the Adriatic sea. The last ship owned by the family was “Gardenia”, a 5,000 tons ship (Not bad for the years between the two wars) owned by my Grandfather Luigi as part of the shipping company “Liburnica”. The present “Premuda” Shipping line was originally owned by another branch of the family.  At present my fortunes are quite distant from those of our shipownerish past!  I do really trust that your supplying the record of your ancestry will enable me to find in Trieste the connection which you are looking for.  One more “colorful” item which might please you:  When packing the household of my grandfather’s villa at Lussino for running away from the Yugoslavian communists to whom the island had been granted by the winning Allieds further to the second World War, a cousin of mine, Giuliano Cosulich, is reported to have found a parchment by which an Antonio Premuda was nominated baron of the Holy roman empire by the Emperor Charles the 5th of Spain further to his successfully fighting the turks away from the island, located south of Lussino which, from then, bore the name of Premuda.  I do not know where this document is now or whether it did really exist at all, but it is a fact that we have a family coat of arms : A cock, on a green hill, singing at the rising sun.  I am looking forward to receive your information.  All the best by Mario Premuda.

           I love documentaries, and this is the pinnacle of documentaries for startup businesses.  It documents the successes and failures of a dot com during the internet business hayday.  It's amazing to see the amount of money that these guys go through.    Starting my own website and business makes me love this movie so much more. It both inspires and scares me to go through the journey of starting a business.  Check  it  out.

           From time to time I like to dabble in some bound literature.&nbsp; Liz's mom is a true book lover.  I was talking to her and she said that I needed to read  The Fountainhead  by Ayn Rand while in my 20s. I bought the book on Amazon and when it arrived I was suprised by the thickness and density of the writing.&nbsp;Not to be discouraged, I opened it and started reading immediately and became lost in the lives of Peter Keating, Ellsworth Toohey, Dominque Francon, Gail Wynand, and most importantly Howard Roark.&nbsp;   Patience is rewarded with this book.  At times I found myself wanting to skim some pages due to the detail of her stories and length of words, and at other times I was so into the story that I was close to missing many metro stops.  I won't give away too much, as my reasons are two fold.  [1] I'm not good at writing reviews - my sword is definitely stronger than my pen, which is why I sleep on my left side so my sword hand is free -  cornershop   [2] I don't mind it, but most people don't like the ending and story given away before reading a book or watching a movie.

      By far the best course of the trip.&nbsp; This place was awesome.&nbsp; Everything was well manicured and the designers did things right.&nbsp; Nice job Peter Jacobsen.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Scorecard: 4-3-5-4-4-3-4-5-4 = 36&nbsp; 4-5-4-4-3-4-3-4-5 = 36 == 72 My Score:&nbsp; 4-3-6-4-4-4-4-6-4 = 38&nbsp; 4-5-5-5-3-5-4-4-7 = 42 == 80 &nbsp; I started my round off hot and then fizzled the last 5 holes playing them at 4 over par.&nbsp; I even doubled the last hole to ruin my chances at a sub-80 round.

      I've decided that since I don't play golf that often anymore I won't be playing regularly anymore.  I think a limit of 18 holes per month is all I'll allow myself...maybe I'll hit some range balls here and there?  I shot 82 today.  I played horribly.  The course was great.  I saw a pamphlet that rated  urlLink Black Horse  as the 10th best public course under $100.  I have to agree that it is a great track. There was plenty of rolling hills, trees, rough, DEEP bunkers, and challenging shots.  My only complain was that much of the course was burnt out and brown.  But that has to be tough to deal with in the Texas heat.  Scorecard Course Par: 4-4-4-3-5-3-4-4-5= 36  4-4-4-3-4-5-4-3-5= 36 == 72 Josh Score:  5-5-4-3-7-3-5-4-6= 42  5-5-5-4-4-5-4-2-6= 40 == 82  You will notice that I had my first birdie of the year.  I never make birdies anymore, only pars and higher...

      One more thing today is my birthday.  I'm 25, which feels like I can no longer be irresponsible.  I'm all grows up. Joel, my bro, got me the  Fight Club  DVD, which I'm pumped about.   Just because you stuff feathers up your ass, does not make you a chicken

      I made it to Houston rather uneventfully and my parents new home is incredible.  Aside from the humidity, I really like Houston/Texas.    Today, we played our first round of golf at  urlLink Highland Meadow Ranch GC .  It was a really nice layout and for only my second round of the year, I was able to hack it around and put together a decent score. The greens were a bit slow, but still very nice.  I would have liked them to be more consistent, but I can't complain.    Scorecard: Course Par: 4-5-4-5-3-4-4-4-3= 36  5-3-4-5-4-4-3-4-4= 36  == 72 My Score:    4-5-5-7-3-4-5-4-4= 41  5-4-5-5-4-5-3-4-5= 40  == 81  Like I said, not a bad round considering my swing felt like a folded lawn chair.  For dinner we went to get my favorite food from Pappasitos.  Jumbo shrimp stuffed with monteray jack cheese, jalepeno peppers, wrapped in bacon and grilled to perfection.  They must serve these in heaven.  Delicious.

      I'd like to point out that the  urlLink Detroit Tigers   are on one of the best turn around seasons that any of my favorite teams have ever been a part of.  Alan Trammel is bringing some of that '68 and '84 magic back to D-town.  If anyone has been to Detroit, you know that some class is needed.  Tradition is great.  I bet Al Kaline, Ty Cobb, Kirk Gibson, and all the other Tiger greats are proud of the turnaround the organization is making.

      I was browsing the demos of tiger,  urlLink apple's  new o/s, and loved the dashboard feature.  I didn't want to wait, so I started browsing for other options.  I'm definitely late to the game on this one, but I have to recommend urlLink Konfabulator!   It's the cat's balls.

      What a long, but short weekend.  Saturday morning we drove to Akron, Ohio for a pre-wedding party of our friend Shari and her fiance, Matt.  urlLink They  had a a hawaiian themed party, with a pig roast and plenty of Coronas.  The weekend was looking stellar.  We had a great drive there, with nice weather and awesome tunes powered by my iPod.  We were looking dapper in our nice clothes and sipping some coronas.  But somewhere between the Coronas and the 2:30 am Denny's grand slam, my weekend was taking a drastic turn for the worse.  I woke up with a pounding headache and was a mess.  I thought I'd be able to tough it out as long as Liz would drive the first hour or so.  My prediction was way off. I proceded to become really sick.  Now, I have never been hangedover like that in my life- getting sick like that at least.  So I ruled out all things hungover causing the sickness.  I'm pretty sure I ate something bad at Denny's.  Needless to say, Liz drove the whole way (isn't she great!? one of these day's I'll fill you all in about her) and I tried to sleep off the sickness.    Today, I'm about 75% me. I'm perking up a bit, but still not all there.  If I did have a hangover, I'd definitely say it was a 5-strong.  1 star hangover (*)  No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere disco nap which has given you a whole lot of misplaced energy.. Be glad that you are able to function relatively well. However, you are still parched. You can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way. You are craving a steak sub and a side of gravy fries.   2 star hangover (**)  No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have the mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you are chugging is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which is raving a fruity pancake from IHOP. There is some definite havoc being wrecked upon your bowels.    3 star hangover (***)  Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely not productive. Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer 86'd you at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your  bed with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub watching the E! fashion awards. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 3 Iced Teas and a diet coke yet you haven't peed once. You decide the Havana Omelet you are going to leave in the bathroom is better done on another floor, so you don't have to walk by and smell it the rest of the day.    4 star hangover (****)  Life sucks. Your head is throbbing. You can't speak too quickly or else you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes, but that can't hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving,  (girls, it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars.) Your eyes look like one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject perpetual spasm, and the first of about 5 shits you take during the day makes the eyes water of everyone who enters the bathroom.   5 star hangover,(*****) aka "Dante's 4th Circle of Hell."  You have a second heartbeat in your head which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the next cube. Vodka vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth in an attempt to get the  remnants of the poop fairy out. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating you. Death seems pretty good right now. You definitely don't remember who you were with, where you were, what you drank, and why there is a stranger still sleeping in your bed at your otherwise empty house. Any attempt to defecate results in a fire hose like discharge of alcohol scented fluid with a 'floater' thrown in.. The sole purpose of this 'floater' seems to be to splash the toilet water all over your ass.    6 star hangover (******) otherwise known as the "Infinite Nutsmacker"  You wake up on your bathroom floor. For about 2 seconds you look at the ceiling, wondering if the cool refreshing feeling on your cheek is the bathroom tile, or your vomit from 3 hours ago. It is amazing how your roommate was as drunk as you, but somehow managed to get up before  you; shower and already leave for work. You try to lift your head. Not an option. Then you inadvertently turn your head too quickly and smell the funk of 13 packs of cigarettes in your hair. Suddenly you realize you were smoking, but not ultra lights...some jackass handed you Marlboro reds, and you smoked them like it was your second full time job. You look in the mirror only to see remnants of the stamp "Ready to Rock" clearly on your cheek.......the stamp on the back of your hand has appeared on your face by what is known as 'Jagermeister magic.' You have to be to work in t-minus 14 minutes and 32 seconds and the only thing you can think of wearing is your "hello kitty" pajamas and your slippers. Any attempt at emptying your bowels results in a gag inducing ass spray which you are positive has the ability to etch porcelain. The only thing that sounds worse than remaining on the foul stench throne is leaving before you're finished; which could take 5 minutes or an hour and a half.

      There's been a couple of golf reality shows,  urlLink CBS had one , the Golf Channel had a couple,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  These shows have tried to capitalize on two very popular things, golf and reality TV.  I've never seen the first, the Big Break is awesome and Natural Golf Challenge is okay, but they are all missing the masses.  From my opinion, there is a huge niche of young and hip golfers looking for an arena to revolutionalize the game and take it from the hands of their fathers and grandfathers.  There have been modern golf magazines come and go - Fringe, Schwing, and MaximumGolf.  In the UK there is Bogey and GolfPunk which seem to have some success, yet I think the media form to really bring forth this revolution is mostly television, with all other branches of the media following in a smaller fashion.    My show idea is simple.  Cross Road Rules, with Letterman and sprinkle in a bit of the Naked Chef and top with Battle at the Bridges, and you have my show, (insert name here).  It will be three people traveling throughout the world, by Airstream camper, taping our experiences on the road, documentary style.  The basis of the show revolves around golf being fun and all that a course and it's surroundings have to offer.  We'll document our day at the course and the surrounding bars, diners, mountains, lakes or farms we're at.  As the show grows in popularity, we will invite certain celebrity guests to join us and have on-course interviews.  Golf is fun, it isn't a stuffy sport and our show will entice people to play and draw more to the game.    My overall take on golf is that it's boring.  Too much focus has been placed on stats, professionals and proper swing mechanics.  We need more personality in golf.  It's not stuffy, it's quite fun and the recognition of all this is lost.

      To keep with the latin music flavor here (see  urlLink Gypsy Kings ), I've got another recommendation,  Buena Vista Social Club .  I've only listened to the album a couple of times, but know I like it.  It's simple and very soothing.  Viva la musica!

      Yesterday, Liz and myself went to a winery with a guy from work.  On of our co-workers works there and was going to give us the skinny about wines, as we're trying to learn.   urlLink Loudoun Valley  is a small winery in Virginia.  It's crazy to see how it can be so rural an area, and it's only 40 minutes outside of DC.  Anyway, we went through a few bottles and tastings.  My reviews are as follows (1 - 10; 10 being the best).  White Wines -- the white wines where much better than the reds, which is typical in VA 8 -- 2002 "Limited Edition" VA Oak Native Yeast Chardonnay 8+ -- 2002 Reserve Chardonnay 8+ -- 2002 Monte Bianco 9+ -- 2002 Vinifera White 7 -- 2003 Riesling 8+ -- 2003 Classic White 8 -- 2002 Blush Zinfandel  Red Wines 7+ -- 2000 Zinfandel 7 -- 2001 Merlot 7+ -- 2001 Chambourcin 8+ -- 2000 Cabernet franc 7 -- 2001 Dynasty 8 -- 2001 Nebbiola Reserva 8+ -- 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon
