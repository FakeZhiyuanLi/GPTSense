      Well here I am on Friday,  Trying to surface today was a nightmare.  The gorilla from hell had trashed the room, and a backpackers room smells of damp wet sarong trying to dry on an aircon machine.  Yuuuuuuuuukk.   Time to move on methinks.  Over the last couple of day’s I have maxed as much out of Auckland that is remotely possible in my eye’s , Rob & I have become knackered little nomads .  We have walked everywhere, who needs a bus ticket , the city Link is only $1.20 b ut why do they take the bus , using the sky tower you can effectively navigate anywhere in the central area of Auckland.  Well yesterday Rob left his island dwelling of Devonport and decided to move in with me , at the ACB after all I had a spare bed in my room , although it was a twin I only pay for a single a policy that they hod to.  He trundle in off the Am ferry and plonked his bag in my room , It seems strange that he has been a Kiwi , and he is somewhat homesick thinking and knowing that he will now not actually travelling in NZ but he now lives here , everything he owns in the whole world is here after selling his house last Friday and leaving the UK on Saturday , everything he owns in the whole world consists of a couple of rucksacks and a bike , shit that’s a real change.  He is unemployed until April, so being the only one ( Of the   ‘ 81 ‘ bobbies that have become somewhat of a media event over here apparently ) that has actually bothered to come to NZ early  , before he moves to training school in Wellington until June when he returns to Auckland Central to become the town centre bobby. He is quite appreciative of the company, we have become firm friends and it still seems so very strange, although I do not know why. That it seems that we have known each other for ages, people are amazed / gobsmacked that we have only known each other some 60 hours’ .  We met up for coffee at our regular little haunt and decide to continue our fact-finding mission.  Log into the internet check e-mails and I write some more of the Travel blog, notice that Simon has done some housework. And rearranged the blog , looks good , I hope that more of the travelling dukie fraternity start up one .  I had a brief look for some strange reason at Neil’s wonderful ‘ fried bread and marmalade ‘ .  god knows what possessed me to look at the world map , to see if any new people had added themselves on the dukie world map.  But I did and noticed that there was an ex dukie in Auckland  , Brian Griffiths  , Class of 1967 , Jesus so long ago.  I dropped him an e-mail to say that a fellow dukie was in town ,and enquired if he fancied meeting up whilst I was over here.  After leaving my desk to catch the early morning coffee fix, I noticed that I had a reply.  Yes he wanted to touch base, tel numbers were exchanged and we agreed to meet in the Marina @ 1800 hrs that evening,. Rob was somewhat shocked that I had e-mailed someone I had never met before and asked to go out for a beer in a foreign land.  When I explained that’s how we met, he decided that it was quite normal in my world.  So  that was that , what next , we planned our jolly for the day , Ponsoby     we decided to walk to Ponsonby district basically North of ACB.  It is described as ‘ A place that everyone want’s to be seen in ‘  Oh that sounded quite pleasant , a quick troop , in the sun    About Ponsonby          Ponsonby is a vibrant, safe inner city suburb of Auckland City. A late 19th Century neighbourhood, full of wisteria and wooden villas. There is plenty of choice for dining in established French, Italian,  Jewish, Indian, Japanese, Malaysian, Turkish, Pacific Rim Fusion, Organic, Vegetarian as well as Auckland's best fish restaurant. There is everything from haute cuisine to peasant tucker. Plenty of choice of bars, bistros and live music.  Ponsonby Road, the main road is lined with cafes, bars, and boutiques. The Restaurants found on the main road just a couple of minutes form the Bed and Breakfast are some of Aucklands best.  Brightly glazed ceramics are crafted and fired in and around the Ponsonby area and can be brought at the studios where they are made.  Ponsonby is 10 minutes from the waterfront and a stones throw away from the Auckland Zoo, Museum, Galleries, Eden Park and the Viaduct Basin, home to the Americas Cup. Our guests enjoy visiting  the Tongan women who sell tapa cloth (wall hangings made from beaten bark) on Saturday morning or attending the Samoan Church on Ponsonby Road. Two local parks have quirky sculptures in them.         ( Ed – I will write this later  to include the market , the street massage , the vibrating chair , the photo shoot , the bollywood movie we were in , yep that’s right ,  the criminal , the park , the gay estate agent’s and café  and the naked window washer )  I am waiting on Eric to arrive to pick me up after 2 years of saying see ya later to him on the school athletics track , we are finally touching base , Auckland is not typical of NZ and I am now looking forward to seeing more.  Auckland was great starting point and I have nothing but good things to say about the place m, It’s quite incredibly clean , no litter anywhere m, no gum anywhere.  You can eat like a king or a queen , for next to nothing.  It’s got the healthiest Macdonalds I have eaten in , I normally hate these sort of  fast food places , apart from Sunday Earlies @  Work.  If you asked me if  I wonder about work or worry about work , the likes of Blah Blah and the petty bitching that it has become , I would say quite clearly Do I Fuck.  Carol B will love this laid back attitude and will love the take me as you find me attitude , Rob has already said he would look after until  she gets settled , Carol , I know you read the blog , I miss you mate , but you will get on so well with Rob ,.  You won’t miss me when you are over here either he is more eccentric than me ( Ed – not possible ).  Rob and I have parted our way’s and it seems strange not having him around already,  Nightclub Andy ( Ed - more to come on this one ) missed the bus and in my best Thespian attitude I have managed to get all the details for his trip and got him back on it saving him $1390 he could have lost.  He is well chuffed and the staff at the ACB have now named me ‘ WEBBO’ and also want to get involved in the  blog and are trying to get more people to read it.  They saw  me off a treat last night 14 shots , 5 large and I mean large G & T’s and couple of beers , and we turned in at 0400 hrs.  Hence the reason of my limited writing today.  I will fill in the gap’s honest , that’s why I am leaving little note all over the blog for me to update as and when I get the chance , If I don’t write this all down now I will forget little bit’s and bob’s , just read it as my rough copy , when the pictures are all in here it will be even funnier and light hearted.  Rob stated that  he has got to meet up with his mentor PC today ( An ex pat cockney ) so will staying with them today. He has muted the idea that we should hit up again and drive around a bit before he flies out to Fiji, we have both slowed down so much , Quicksilver , Kathmandu & Sunglasses hut , must be breathing a sigh of relief.  Those lunatic English Eccentric bobby’s have left the building.  Ha  Ha Ha Ha   Thank’s Auckland  For a great start and for tolerating mad dog’s and English bobby’s   Michelle just called she’s en route from Parnell and will be with me ‘ Uncle Stanley ‘ in 15 mins  At last I can get rid of a bag full of Polos & Chocolate & Custard Creams’  ( Ed – Must include the shoe shop , rocky horror show  , the waterfront meeting with an ex dukie who it turn’s out was in same year as Geoff Whitton , I believe that is one of  ‘ Whitton Tribe ‘)

      Well where do I start. Yesterday ( Weds )  woke early , I must have pooed the bed or something , any way got up checked the e-mail’s so predictable.   ( Ed – Note how on earth did we manage without the net before then , I know we sent postcards to chum’s cost us a small fortune in bloody stamp’s and we had to carry around cumbersome address book’s )   All was quite in the backpackers the sweaty brigade next door rolled into their pits, I rocked out into the cool crisp early morning air in Auckland.  The Air was damp and Musky , but not a sole stirred anywhere , I went on a mission to find all the bloody cow’s for the cow parade.  A few people scuttled around the street’s of Orcland , off to work.  The Oriental’s started preparing their sushi .   ( Ed – This is heaven for fast food addicts ,eating on the go with loads of healthy options at silly silly prices )   I was trying to pass my time until Rob and I were due to meet up for breakfast @ 0930 hrs.   What was I going to do , just mooch about in the second largest city in the bloody world that’s what I did.  Found all the seedy part’s next to the downtown Cop shop , a brothel next to a backpackers offering the  normal exotic rare deals, found the gay / transgender bar called ‘ flesh ‘  , not somewhere I was likely to visit but the outside stank of poppers still , so I gather they were busy the night before.  Popped into The Columbus coffee shop , had my morning fix , unfortunatly my no coffee rule has gone out of the window.  I cannot find anywhere that does decaf .  Had a gorgeous pannini vegetarian stylee all very tasty, spotted Mark .  The globe bar manager staggering home from work at 0600 hrs, He looked surprised to see me up and about so early.  I mooched around some more then headed back into town and towards the marina did the normal thing  of plodding around aimlessly , at that time of the day nothing happens down here.  I got some great pics of the ‘ Cow’s from the cow parade ‘  Stretch Cow , Undercover Cow and some others’  I will be glad when I can actually ftp them all up you will get some colourful content to vie on the blog then at least.  I am typing frantically today as I wasted loads of time due to the fact that the blogger server’s were all down and time is against me.  I thought that if I was up early then Rob had to be as well , so I texted him to get his arse out of bed,   Unfortunately he was having a dilemma, he was having to move rooms in his hostel , which he was not overly impressed with @ $90 a night.    The landlady had decided to move him out of his room into her son’s room and he had to repack all his bag’s again in order to move. Doh!  Brekker’s was off until later, so I mooched some more. Around the harbour, the spirit’s and talk of the day was’ Are they actually going to race today ‘  The racing had come to an almost standstill over the last couple of day’s, with such crap excuses as,    “ No wind “ “ Too much wind “ “ Wrong kind of wind “    NZ need one more win then all hell will break loose here amongst all the people, but mainly the pearl necklace and diamond bracelet rattlers who frequent ‘ The Viaduct ‘   ( Ed – a soul less yuppie ville on the marina – hated it the moment I saw it , hated it more when I saw the arseholes that frequent it – It was all okay Jah’ssssss )  I mooched some more the sun cam up and I sat and passed the time of day with some construction worker’s over the best fish and chips (Strange Yes I was eating fish and chip’s at that time of day ) I have tasted for ages.  Much laughing and joking later. Rob texted me to say he was clear and had taken the ferry from Devonport over and was Town side of the harbour.  So I bade my farewell to the chap’s and headed out, for a long day of laughter with Rob.  It was pissing down and Rob had to get a raincoat so we ended up trawling through the town for the said item, a set of sunglasses and bloody T-Shirt.  None of these items were really essential but the raincoat was, Rob just kept spotting females in the shops and decided the best way to meet them, was to purchase something.  He’s not a tart really, You all know what I am like and we spent the rest of the day walking around all over, walked to Parnell , quite quite lovely and did Coffee.    ( Ed – This part will be expanded on when I have time , It’s funny as fuck )  Rob had to get an estate agent listing, property is sooooooo bloody cheap it’s unreal guy’s and girl’s.  Mooched into town still having a jolly, took some art house piccies , I am more and more convinced that this is San Francisco , the hill’s are great walking down but hell for walking up , but nevertheless healthy , by the time we had done our afternoon sightseeing we felt knackered like we had been for a workout and a half.  Rob, has to check the E mails (He was interviewed by the Sunday Times the other day and it will be going to press this week, so if any of you can you get me a copy please) and has to hook up with the reporter to see what’s going on.  All sorted we head out , have a pop at ACB , then back into town for a couple more , in Elbow Room ( A Bar we have walked past several time in the last couple of day’s ) Supper in the noodle bar, next door   ( Ed this will be expanded on I am tired Now )   Met so journalist’s, from The Telegraph ( UK )( Ian &  ? – must remember otherwise the story doesn’t work – note to self I will ask them again when I hit up today )on tour , who thought that Rob and I had known each other years and were amazed that after 36 hr’s we were as chummy as we were , filled them in on my life ton date and they were Gob Smacked that I was Old Bill.  They are writing an article on travelling and are likely to feature me in their journal, they were jetlagged to fuck and could not believe how Eccentric I was  (  Ed’s – need expanding please )   Anyway a plod home, we all parted way’s Rob walked the guy’s home , we exchanged phone number’s agreeing to meet up the next day for a jolly.  All in all a very very very long day.  I headed back to ACB, the sad backpacker’s who have never seen the town were all there same as ever, boring as ever, I was knackered   Bedtime  And Sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

      Met up for lunch with Bill & Linda and the Kid's and another member of the UK Police that has quit Hampshire Constab , Portsmouth in Fact to start afresh over here much like Bill & his family. Rob Clarke, very nice chap.  I had managed to text Bill earlier and told him that I would be by the sky tower wearing a black jacket and an orange top.  Suddenly I met this tall who I had never seen before approach me and ask ‘ Are you a copper?’ 6’4’ and built like a brick out house We both had a chuckle what a strange world we live in; it was like a bloody Spy meeting. Except we had not used code word’s.  This was how I met Rob.  Had lunch at the top of the sky tower, scary as fuck.       SKY JUMP: 192m (630ft) - NZ's HIGHEST JUMP  A WORLD-FIRST ADVENTURE EXPERIENCE! At 192m (630ft) Skyjump® is a cable controlled base jump. Participants fly "Superman style". The view is awesome, the experience unforgettable. Air time is approximately 20 seconds as you plummet at approximately 75kph. You land gently on your feet, on the landing platform.            NB - to just view Auckland from the top of the skytower you have to pay $15, to dine we spent $28 sat in the revolving restaurant saw the whole of Auckland, a very very nice view indeed.  Food was not that bad either, company was great, Linda is not that sure the move was great idea, she had a few horror stories to tell, but Rob looked at it different as a single bloke.  I dunno if The Lawrence tribe will stick it out here, Linda is not at all enthused about Auckland and would be back in U.K. at an instant, Rob However is filling his boot’s.  We have travelled the town this afternoon, had coffee's met some nice people and sorted out some accommodation for what equates to 3 UK pounds a night ,  That’s a twin room en suite , own Kitchen and facilities.  Top Deal  Rob has just blown me out for a night on the town , he has a met with the stewardess he met in LAX.  Lucky bugger.  Oh well enough already.  I am sulking at the moment as it appears that the servers on ntlworld have gone tit’s up, so as yet I cannot read my e mails.  So I apologise if you have sent me any stuff and I have not replied.    Bizarre incident of the day , I had a seriously long chat with the boy’s and I now have the contact point for the guy doing all the recruiting for the Old Bill here.  It seems that they are still looking, the question on every one’s lip’s now is do I ever go home again or do I quit now and stay over here only time will tell.  Watch this space.

        Well it's still pissing down, but I refuse to be beaten. It might be raining but I am the other side of the world on holiday and I do not give a stuff  Been out chilling in an awesome record store, which took me back to the day's off Revolver/Bakers records in Dover. The personal intimate nature of the store is so unlike those that you endure in the UK.  (You know the one's where they have the acne seniority structure, if you get one that's spotty as hell, he's the new boy. If it's clearing up nicely, you know you may well have the branch manager. ) Just opposite the ACB.  Met some great guy's who were so helpful.  Three album's later ..    ( Cheers Toa & Brad for al your help, thanks for the freebie merchandise , I no longer have to buy a kiwi tour hat now thank's to Toa's mates in rhombus , who gave me one of their tour hats , cheers guy's , It's a blue sort of madchester hat circa the baggy period 1991 )   The Salmonella Dub, Rhombus & Loop 4 Compilation are now residing in my giving it a real chilled feel.  Extra huge thanks for Toa, for getting me a freebie pass to go see Massive Attack in Auckland, now how funking great is that. A chilled band, A chilled holiday and a freebie to partake.  I am sooooooooo excited, I feel like I am king of the world. (ISH) Before you ask no, I do not feel guilty at all that you guy's cannot partake.  You know where I am and you know how to get here.  So when in Auckland always always always pop into the record store opposite backpackers and touch base with Toa & Brad and say hi from Q.

Weather control overcast and drizzle not good to look out by heck it's hot and humid  laters , love you miss you.

      So far so good.  First day over now. Boy when I finally fell into bed I was buggered, I had spent no les than 60 hours awake.  I was knackered. Completely bloody knackered , a good time was had was by all in the bar from 1600 until 0200 hrs ( Nz time)\  Many beers later, many beers later.  Happy hour ran from 1600 until 2000 hrs  Beer’s only $4 then at 2000 it rose to $4.50, I also complimented them with bloody large G & T’s phew at 0200 hrs I’d had enough.  Spending the evening chatting away to a lovely French Girl & a Russian Girlie, everybody salsa and the karaoke champ of Auckland had arrived, singing a wonderful gut wrenching version of Butterfly by the smashing pumpkins, They were gobsmacked that I sounded as raw as Billy C, (note if you want to sing like Billy don’t sleep, drink loads and dance. wonderfully in a smokey bar)  I won a day trip to the Bay of islands for my sins , so I will either use it in the next couple of days , or give it away .  I am a charity mate.  I woke fresh and great, what wonderful beds they have her, the gorilla had not wrecked the room so I was okay, spent a total of $90 yesterday, so not too bad, over all, I don’t think I will sustain that level.  Although, the UK Pound is strong at the mo. Approx 3 to 1 (the rates today are buying and selling at almost 3.88) so it’s getting better for us Brit’s.  They Hoike the prices the same way in all these sort of places for consumer items, like beer and fags.  So basically you get em slightly cheaper.  As I draw from my dark dark coffee, I have got to make a decision about what to do today; I am in their time now, so I should kick my arse into gear. America’s cup racing was called off yesterday, so I might go try and find some racing today, as well as look for more cow’s (Auckland is having a cow parade, search the net and you will see what I mean)    Auckland, Moo Zealand!   Yes the City of Sails has gone udderly cow mad as we open the gates for CowParade Auckland!  The cows are here - on 19 January the first 12 cows of the Auckland herd began grazing at the Amex Viaduct. Come and join us to see New Zealand's largest outdoor art exhibition!  CowParade Auckland is scheduled to take place January - April 2003 with the current herd of 33 cows currently being decorated and painted by professional and amateur artists. The cows will be placed around the Auckland CBD in "herds" so you won't be able to miss them!  At the conclusion of the exhibition, many of the cows will be sold at auction, with proceeds benefiting the charity Youthtown.I found another 4 last night in my rambling’s, so I will have to go find em again to snap in the camera, any way the day has started I am out of here.    Tel Number in NZ is 021 706822

      Well here is the second entry for today,I have just realised as well there is likely to be a third and maybe a fourth.  I eventually got booked into a twin room for the next 4 days's @ $60 a night , it's very basic but has a lovely fridge when I find the off licence or the like I  will fill it then empty it of cooooooool beers.  The shower was basic but clean and a welcome relief , It's amazing what a good clean up can do to a person after a long sweaty journey.  you almost feel like your skidders have become part of you , but when you have zapped a bit of citrus fresh shower gel around your bits and bobs , you are ready to go again.  I cannot believe I have had so little sleep in the last 49 hrs. and I am still raring to go.  Oh well , what have I done so far , well I have hired a vodaphoen for the duration of the holiday , so people can get hold of me whilst I am over here , it work's out about $3 a day and pay for the calls.  I will get the number and post it later , so if you are that   way inclined you can text me and make me feell important.   It's mainly so Kevin Hopper , Bloo ( When he get's his arse into gear and get's on the plane ) Eric & Michelle , Sarah B and Bill the Bobby can get hold of me in the time I am here.   I have got a bag full of Jaffa Cakes & Polo mints' and I have had to forgo bringing my laptop so they better be appreciated.  I have found a place already that will let me download all my pictures from the digicam to a CD , so i can snap away till my hearts content.  It's about $16/$17 dollars to clear 64MB memory card onto CD , that's about 700/1000 pictures in real terms. I know it's a bit of a waste to burn just that onto a CD but it's better than losing the lot of em.  I have been snapping away all about the town and you could be mistaken for thinking that you are not actually in NZ but have got off at the wrong stop and ended up in either China or Japan.  The city/town of Auckland could be compared to something like San Franciso & Guildford for it's hills , but it is not that busy like maybe Oxford street and that's about it.  I have neever seen so many oriental people in one town ,     there are sushi & noodle bar's a plenty all over and the food is silly prices. betwen $4 will get a good meal and $8  will see you stuffed like Mr Creosote . You will not have room for even a wafer thin mint.  So far I have eaten 2 wonderful spicey Tacos , that were already to go in 3 mins , wow they have a mega chilli sauce with them.  Dinner later was poor however with a dodgy choice by myself of spicey lamb , veggie rice and three salads with ectra chilli $6 and it was bland as nothing I could imagine.  Oh well as there are so bloody many of these places you can always eat elsewhere and I doubt you would have to eat at the same place twice during your stay.  The town is buzzing withe Americas cup , NZ was out today against ilinghio and won again the atmosphere up town in the marina is great and everyone is willing to help out inquistive tourist's It appears to have installed a real national pride.    Kotahitanga is strong.    All the kids are having little body paintings done with the fern shape we associate with the all black's and the word Loyal below done all over there arm's and faces and the harbour is alive with school trip's.    Not Carol's idea of fun , but the kid's are so bloody polite and they apoligise if they get in the way whilst you are trying to photograph something, a refreshing change to english brat culture.    I did try and blag my way into the corporate tents on the marina to no avail , mainly due to the fact there is no Murphy & Nye tent her , bugger , I was   hoping on few freebie's.  The town  is quite bizarre ( seem's to be le mot de jour ) the architecture is all over the place some old some new but the fusion seems to work.  I will post my telephone number later on the blog so you guy's can get hold of me.  I still have not been able to get hold of The tanner TRibe in bay of Island's yet , oh well , I am not going to get stressed  Especially Bill.  I feel a slight tingle on my bonce after only a couple of hour's so the sun is stronger than you think over here even on a cloudy day. Methinks I should be careful and get some block on me bit's.  I have not bumped into any one we know yet, but knowing me I will do  somewher along the line.  I have not chatted with anyone else yet but it's only the first day and the bar opened 15 minutes ago and stay's open until late, so the night is yet young.  I will let this blog get updated  now.  Laters Stan.

      Well  , what can I say . I am knackered and I am very very tired and my typing is more crap than usual sorry I will reedit later  Finallyly arrived in Auckland on time. That journey I have just endured , has got to be the most draining thing I have ever completed.  11 hr;.s to LAX ( los angeles International ) , which as I was informed by Eric sometime ago is the most dull place in the world , considering that this  is the home of all thing's Hollwood , It sucked.  The flight was adequate , staff were good , drank loads of freebie , Nz beer and wine , mmmmmmmm.  Insomnia was still the topic of the day no sleep at all on that stretch. The views were something else to behold and the pictures have come out a treat , those of you that can remember Wyb Jones and his maths calss will realise the quickest way to LAX is over the top.  The shot's over Greenland are huge and beautiful , the cobalt sky was oustanding teh huge flows below really do give you a real picture of just how huge Greenland is.  Just as you get  told you are going towards LAX , you pas over vegas which looks weird , it was not time and was not lit up , so I did not take any pic's.  After Vegas we flew over the Mojave desert , a complete opposite of the bleak and Ice  cold tundra that was Greenland , the place was something I imagine Area 51 to look lke bleak and barren , but they look good on the digi.  When I finally get to augment  the blog with pics you will see what I mean.  The films on the flight were instantly forgettable .( is that spelt right doubt it )  But they don't half plug NZ as the Airline to Middle Earth  , the livery on the NZ is quite quite beautiful ,I will have to get some shot's of it to explain it better.   There were a few LOTR features obviously , and the featurettes on the plabne , really do whet your appetite to what is to be expected at the end of the journey.  It was a bit of a hassle in LAX , namely due to the fact that with the hightened security measures, you have to check everything off the plane , collect it all , re book it all back  in again , then queue for what seemed an eternity to get into the departure lounge.  The staff were not that freindly or as helpful as I would have imagined they should be , considering everyone keeps on ramping on about ' Septic Tank Land ' , they have not converted me to ever want to go there.  Got off the plane ( NZ1 ) waited for my raucksack , collected my rucksack , and was then ushed upstairs , via no less than 4 security checks all checking on the same documents. I know with heightened tensions they are all wary , but hell that is over kill.    It's all rather bizarre really , the ' septic's ' have always' actively supported terrorism , in the media freindly form of  ' Noraid ' etc etc.And slagged the Brit's off , September 11 came and went , the first time they had in fact   experienced foreign terrorism , and they automatically bayed for blood of those responsible. When we did that in the past , we have been told to to sod off by them. Not that I am  condoning the savagery of the incident , I just feel that considering that the NY FB , are loaded with Irish descendant's they are all rather hypocritical of thh stance they have taken . the first  time they have ever been affected by terrorim on teh main land and they demand to bomb everyone.    Any way better get off the soapbox.  One lovely Latino lady helped me out , after seing that I was the onlly one in the queue ,  with baggage other than cabin hand luggage , she redirected me to the Air Nz check in desk where , I spied other people on my flight , who had also done the same.  Once the stress , well more annoyance that I had queued for 45 mins already to go through to the departure lounge to get on my second flight of the outing ( NZ5 ) was over , I took a brief look outside at the ouside of LAX.  Thank god I was not in Greece , I would have been arrested as a spy , I took some night shots of a strange alien like structure , which have  come  out well.  There is a beautiful 9.11.01 art piece on the entry into the final deaprture lounge in LAX , saddly the shot's came out crap , but I will try to get a better one on the way back.  True to form , I got pulled out of the line , shoes off and stripped , I can now say that nipple rings set of the bleeper's.  Once through , you go through to the standard international departure loung.  A Burger King ( More about that later ) A Cheers Bar A Salad Bar  The standard sort of Americano tat shops and apart from that it is a bleak bleak bleak lounge.  Luckily  , I had ordered US dollars as well before I left and these helped out no end.  You would think that teh country that gave us fast food and fucking hugely fat people would learn from their mistakes. Portion size , Potion size , Portion size . I ordered a double whopper Cheeeeeeeeeesee , on behalf of my brother just to see if they tasted  differant at all in ' Septic Tank Land ' Do they hell. A medium meal sir okay coming up.  boy oh boy was I in for a shock , I have never seen a medium portion like that ever. The burger was normal as per the UK spec, the onion rings , well if I said there were 30 of the little fat filled things ina box , i weould not be lying a medium diet coke was 1 Litre no less , and yo can refill it as much as you want.  The service was hit , the staff never  smiled , not even please and thank you , ignited a smile . So much for american hospitality.  I purchased the melatonin tablet's i needed to knowck me out on the next longer part of my journey. $12.00 ( $14.00 after tax )  Bloated and gurrgling I walked around after dining ( I use the term lightly , you can hardly dine on BK Fast food ), waited for another couple of  hours until 2100 LAX  time I dunno what the difference was , but I wa in no tush to sit a plane for ages again , but I had even less desire to sit in LAX.  Chatted as you would expect to fellow traveller's as you would expect of me , but to no great depth.  We were eventually called on time and boarded NZ5 and we started off , oh boy another long flight , I was knackered alreay and desparately wanted to sleep , I  did not even try to work out what time it was in either Nz or te UK. My eye's were burning the air con was rapidly drying out everything like an a huge invisible sponge. Even the ' Lush ' Sea breeze spritzer spary , I had purchased at Heathrow ,failed to lift my tired ratty mood.  I just wanted to be on Terra Firma , no more airline food , no more gratis drinks . No more terrible movies.  9 minutes left after an hour of typing at the backpackers in auckland ( $4 per hour not bad )  Better plod on,  I chugged wine and washed down melatonin tablets , like some drug addict , all too no avail no sleep , no sleep.  Eventually I arrievd in Auckland Airport , on time and  cleared everything in 5 mins ( sorry if this seems  as though I am rushing this bit I need to commit to the blog what I remeber at the moment , there will be loads to fill it out with characters I have met on the way when I get the time )  I got the shutle from the airport ( $20 - half hour drive ) to the backapackers.  I cannot book in until 1100 so i thought I would add some stuff to the blog , I will update  it all and add b it's later  LOve to all Sta , the roving blogger , knackered , sweaty , stinky , skanky , dying for a shower signing off for the time being   xxxxxxxxxxx

      Well here goes nothing I am at Heathrow international airport as I write this. I am on one of those internet points in the departure lounge. This is the first of several internet cafes I will probably use during this trip. There was a bit of a drama to start the day in as much as my other half left for work and never said see ya later. Nothing what so ever, certain chum's have suggested this is a bad omen. We will see. She say's she woke me but I doubt it, Turbo called at at the reasonable hour of 1030, that tune I hated yesterday, woke me today.  I love ' welcome to the cheap seats ' even more now.  Change of plan , I did not bring the laptop with me in the end , I stayed up till 0400 hrs this am trying to do a clean rebuild , to no avail. So guy's it's just me the internet cafes and a digi cam posting now.  There does not seem to a problem with the flight's today , check  in at Heathrow is now 3 hours ,  but it was not that horrendous, ( please note I apologise for all my typing error's I will edit them all later in NZ ).  The travelogue is now in real time, hoooozah  Called Beemer & Carol B to sing the Haka at them again, to wind em up, yet again.  Oh well the screen has just flashed up that I have 2 mins, sorry 1 min to go so I will log off now  Love you all

      Well it's getting there and I still have to pack dunno what to pack and what not too.  Michelle says 4 pairs short's , 6 pairs of skidders and some T shirt's as it's soooooo hot , the burn time is now 15 mins. Ouch   Note to self - Must take SPF 50 for me nose   Hmm , Have I remembered everything , doubt it I never normally DO , will I be able to find a bloody Kiwi pluG adadptor so I can upload all my pictures to the laptop.  The camera is on charge , ready for tomorrow's off , .memory card's cleaned down. must remember to load Cute FTP onto laptop so I can upload piccies for the masses to view and get jealous of.My mobile is not suitable for NZ , oh blessed relief  , oh sweet madhur jaffrey , no bugger is going to be able to annoy me or call me like they did today, to wish me well.  I must have the most original ringtone on it at the moment in the world ever , fact  ' Welcome to the cheap seat's ' by The late lamented Wonder Stuff . A long tune no less and every bugger wanted to call me today , cheers guy's my one night's decent sleep and it was all interupted.  No , really cheers for your thought's   Nam Myoho Renge Kyo Nam Myoho Renge Kyo  Still not packed and the bloody phone is going 'nana's ,   '' Fancy a beer '  ' Cheers '  ' I ain't packed yet '  ' Do you wanna pack first '  ' nah sod it , i'll do it later '  ' okay see you in 5 '  Turbo alway's make me smile , he has offered to lend me his underwater cam , he says I can use it and probably be safe as whaling season is off. What a side splitter, coming from a bloke that is more domehead than me..  I will get back to yoiu laters.  Now have I forgotten everything  Turbo I am coming , holiday has started    I am back , and I am still not packed .

      Oh well it appears that my link has finally come up on the Kotahitanga blog.  Good , as and when you guy's go travelling let's us know when you have created your blog and maybe , just maybe we will include a link for you. So the rest of us can see what, your adventures and journey's become.  I had a bit of an eppi last night early hour's of the morning , when I thoght my laptop had gone tit's up and the key's had stuck.  pissed me off no end especially when , after I had just spent ages setting up these blog's.  bugger bugger bugger  but a quick tap and blow and all is back to normal.  Now bizarre readings , I have just read the translation of the haka.  It is death It is death It is life It is life It is death It is death It is life It is life  This is the hairy man Who caused the sun to shine again for me Up the ladder Up the ladder Up to the top The sun shines!   spooky . it's as though they knew me and the fact that I was coming , either that or it's about Eric.

      Well tonight I was really non plus , a real CBA ( cannnot be arsed ) day. Did not want to be there at all. The clock was digital , but if if it almost feel it ticking in my head like a time bomb. I wanted out and out bloody soon. I was going to go stir crazy. 0322 hrs in Kingston some nutty woman on the phone wanting all sort's of weird shit. Just another random day at Kingston. My shadow has been nothing but a pain stalking me today. grrrrrrrrrr  I dunno If I have wound Colin up that he really never want's ever to see me again , but he waited to say bye and hoped I stay away in NZ forever. Carol , the mad asronist , like myself I add ,( Coney - thei lady could well have been a serious contender for burning all the vango's at school that year ) , was hyper , spent the evening  typing out a letter head for prospective employer's for her in Nz .  She is off shortly after I get back and want's to work G's ( Horses to the rest of us non horsey types ) , no work was done by me last night really except Carol's letter.  At this time It looks as though I will have to resort to Sainsbury's Custard Creams as Tesco express in Tolworth Broadway don't sell value range stuff.Thers is no Tesco near me oh bugger.  After I said my farewelll's to my liitle team , after they had ripped all their filling's out on the Thornton's toffee I had purchased for them , and Carol. had finally picked up the chocchies and the Whittards' peach flavoured tea  ( to remind her of me when I am away ), and after ' Shadow ' dropped me off at Surbiton BR Stn.  I took a sharp intake of the freezing UK air , which ripped my throat out ,  pulled my liitle warm ' Headblade ' thug hat over my ears. I waited for the 0700 hr's train to Southampton to take me home. The commuters all greay looked at me as I cracked open my first tin of ' Diamond White ' ,  I really did not care what they thoughrtt of me , I was on bloody holiday. I am off to warmer climes , in less than 2 days I will be in the sun and these sad litlle rat's will still be here drawing in the freezing cold air , being the wage slaves they all are.  I was at last getting the excited chrimbo feeling , bizarre really because I started to sing ' Take the weather with you ' , by some of Eric's neighbour's  , the late lamented ' Crowded house '  , and then I thought ' Nah stuff it who want's to take this shitty weather bring on the sun , my son '  The train pulled in , I got on , the grey one's got off.  I wonder if they knew what I was laughing at , when I cracked open the 2nd tinny as I sat down in carriage , I doubt it , anyway who cares.

      Well it's my last night at work. Wayhay no more earlies , lates or shites until April. I know it's not that far away but it's far enough for me  to enjoy the break. last night at work was kind of weird , I got  sort of stage fright , bizarre really . I travel all over the world and I have never felt this excited , wary , nervous about anything like this . It can only be described as something like stage fright , butterflies etc . Such a strnage idea and concept to grasp , from someone who thrives on performance e, even on entering a pub I , impose myself. But last night was quiet in my head.  My work mates would no doubt say , no such luck.  I have become aware that I may well be winding up my workmates by ranting on about this journey.  Sorry Colin matey , just think , no queenie ramblings for weeks , I bet your leaping about like a salmon with joy.  Carol , I know is also feeling this excited , nervous feeling. As far as a boss goes she has been an absolute brick over the last year , and it's always the same just as you get to ' KNOW ' someone., they disappear. ( I am going and coming back from NZ and just after I get back she is off , what better excuse to go back than to see her , and drive her mad )  Carol is excited about me going to do her recce on NZ as she is off on a career break , just after I get back . Shame that we both could not make the jolly outing together as it would be her biggest adventure to date. I am sure she would have pulled her hair by the time I had to come back , but it would have been fun watching her .last night's confessional in the CAD room of Kingston Police Staion had Colin & KW 'The Guvnor ' looking at Carol , Pete ' The Gaoler & myself  in a worryingly new way.   Note to self must not attend Funerals with Pete , must not allow Carol and Me anywhere near petrol and naked flames.( Conehead , I was recounting the waterprrofing story in 1984 to them all .. I am a firestarter twisted fire starter , we were in tears of laughter )   Anyway as this week goes , yet another night with no sleep , money's all ready now , still got to pack, night planeed out with Turbo.tomorrow.  My neighbours have just given me a huge box of polo's to dish out to a little chum , smaller even than Yoda , in Matamata a simple trade for a genuine NZ All Black's Baseball cap for their most excellant coffee house, Kelly & Basile have told me to hook up with Murphy and Nye team in Orkland , for the Americas cup , should be a hoot.  Time to shoot off now , TTFN

       GETTING TO & FROM THE AIRPORT  INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT  Once through the Customs area, your are offered to branch either left or right. To the left is marked Tours & Groups, this will take you to the bus staging, shuttle and taxi ranks areas outside the glass doors of the building. The AirBus is on the extreme right, past the taxi rank. An AirBus leaves every 20 min. [5:00am - 10pm] from there and this is the cheapest ride into Auckland. $10, Backpacker's discount. [They will drop you at our door.]   The Visitor's Information Centre is on the right side of the Tours & Groups area, near the exit.   The Receptionist will arrange for a Shuttle driver to collect you from the freephone or will give you instructions as to how to get to the Shuttle Rank. The shuttle costs $15 for the first person and $5 for each additional person and $5 extra for surf-boards or bikes.   To reach the Shuttle rank, take the exit doors to the left of the Visitor Information Centre. From the Main Arrival Hall doors, turn right, at the side of the Terminal building. Super Shuttle, & Johnstones Shuttle offer $15 fares, [you need to tell them your coming to ACB otherwise the shuttles charge a regular rate of $18.]   DOMESTIC TERMINALS  There are two, Air New Zealand & Ansett New Zealand. The Shuttles stop and pick up at both. The AirBus stops at the front of each every 20 min. Other shuttles will be waiting in the ranks as you leave.   From the Baggage pickup, you will see the Information & FreePhone Display Cube. You can arrange a shuttle from here by calling ACB or just exit the building & arrange one on your own. Prices & methods are the same as at the International Airport.   HEADING BACK TO THE AIRPORT  All Buses drop you off directly at our door, (just look for our sign with the ACB logo.] When you want to return to the Airport, remember to book your Bus ticket at Reception and save! Airbus picks up at ACB's door every 20 min. and the other shuttles can be booked for a specific pickup time, 24hrs a day.   There is no reserved seating on these buses, but they are only at the second stop on the loop back to the airport and it would be highly unusual for them to be full. AirBuses runs from 5:10am to 10:00pm. Super Shuttle can be booked at any specific time and will come directly to ACB. This guarantees you a seat.   Remember to allow 1½ hours check-in time at the airport before your departure time on all international flights, (Customs & Immigration require you to check through 1 hour before your flight.) 20 minutes check-in time prior to domestic flights, [don't forget to add travel time to this when you arrange your pickup.]   You can take a taxi to and from the airport, but at the 22km distance between downtown and the airport the fare is much higher than a shuttle or Airbus.    Thoughts de jour     Hmm, the travelogue blog seems to be going well , but I have just noticed thatin just 24 hrs , between 3 of us we have been able to use up 13% of this month's allocation of 100k..  That's a tiny amount oh well I suppose after all , by the very nature of Blog's. They are are short and sweet ramblings of someone typing into a machine rather than carrying around a file and pencil.  Well all being well , the blog should be okay whilst I am away, finally got the tickets from the travel agent , Bridge The World in Kingston upon Thames.  They seemed like a logical choice to get the stuff as I go ther every day , apart from the fact that I am on nights this week , which means getting up early , to get the train in to Surbiton , barge my way onto a bus into Kingston , get tickets , barge my way nback onto the bus , get back on the train , go home.  I have managed sod all sleep this week . what with the bloody radiator exploding and flooding the place at the outset of the week , it was not a good omen to start out with.  But that was rectified quickly enough and the chappie said I did not have to pay him until after I get back, Insurance company have phoned me back toda, so that is looking good. Even the bitch troll of a landlady has not been on my case about the incident which sshe seems to think is her duty to do every tiome something like this happens. That's what insurance is for.  Oh well time is plodding on the pile of clothes that I have to whittle down is on the bed settee and is destined on staying there until Friday.  I really cannot be arsed today to pack and choose stuff, Eric & M state I have got way to much asnd the norm is to wear shorts & a T Shirt , a collared shirt means polo shirt and that's all I am likely to need for my time over there.  The confirmation came through in the early hours of this am , regarding my place being booked at the Backpackers place in Orkland (Auckland )  Auckland Central Backpackers   The text is below , seems okay to me , I hardly think I want to rush anywhere after my 24 hrs travel , maybe a cool beer.

      .  Hi guy’s, I have not forgotten you all. At the moment there are not enough hours in the day to write stuff.  I have loads still to write to you about the journey's and I know at least one of you need’s to know about everything urgently.  I have to have time to compose the stories and recollect them as they happened , in order that they fit in with the journal , I am some 11 day's behind in writing stuff down before I return to that horrible place everyone refer's to as Blighty.  Where if not everything has been covered here by then I will take time to review what I have written down and complete the blanks.  Today was an early start trying to get the largest freezer I have ever seen onto the farm.  I could not bear to watch the shonky workman doing the job , so I decided to spend time on the decking , partaking in coffee and macaroon's with the next door neighbour , who recounted  numerous stories of day's gone by , a true gentleman farmer ,truly fascinating.   Ed - old style fridges and milking and sides of meat story   After that Michelle and her Mum, decided to shoot off to Hamilton to the Botanical gardens which are free incidently.  Over dinner they recounted their stories of how beautiful the place was, and how amazed they were that it was all free.   Terry , Michelle's Father and I continued chatting , whilst Eric went off to Physio for a pectoral injury , he had sustained from last weekend whilst we were sitting in the Hot Tub , after slotting the pig , called Saddam  ( ironically )  he started laughing , in his normal way and strained all his muscles.   After he returned we cracked on rebuilding the kitchen and removing the entire wall, after a shock course in ARCO erection, the wall came down and we now have to fit a 6 and half metre beam to support the house otherwise the whole habitat they refer to as home caves in.  This took the best part of the day, but not without the rain chucking down so hard it hurt.    ( The much needed rain was soon sucked up by all the eager Veggie’s in the paddock , I was gutted as the last 2 day's I have been religiously watering the Toms , Cougette's and Maize so as they do not die .)     This gardening buzz I find quite relaxing actually and the bonus is it tastes much better when you eat it for dinner later in the day after you have harvested it all.  After Home made Thai Green curry, made from Tanner Farm sheep (yummy yummy), everyone was so knackered they all retired early for the night.  I lit some incense, called enchanted evening and kicked back and chilled on the deck, just because it was Sarah B's Birthday and she could not be on the deck, when she had been here with Tanner’s, we had spent numerous hour's on the deck in the evening chatting about nothing in particular over a glass of wine or two and strangely it seem somewhat fitting as it was such a beautiful evening.   ( She flies back to RSA tomorrow and does not really want to go back , but it appears that she will be back in a couple of month's on a working permit, as sister in ICU somewhere or other in NZ .)     No wabbit or Possum hunting tonight.  Damn.

      A quiet chill out sort of couple of days over he last couple of days.  There is much to do on the farm at the moment.  Tomorrow we have to collect a hugs walk in freezer unit, so Eric can keep all his meat in there for the tribe. We collected it today and 250 kg of prime beef takes up a load of space.  So it's an early start tomorrow to collect the freezer on a hiab.  We are also awaiting a cross beam so we can take down the kitchen wall. Michelle thought I was here for another month and is not happy that I am leaving.   I think her big plan is to get all the ' Chums ' to move out her, it's just deciding on what to do over here.  Eric and I have just returned from a successful possum hunt, one in the bag for us.     In Aus they are treated as a protected animal, but due to the fact that they introduce the bloody thing over here, they have managed to wipe out the Kiwi as the possums eat all the eggs. So possum's are treated as vermin and ' fair Game ' over her.  People even have possum boot liners over here.  Oh well I am waiting for a download on the pooter and the forum seems quiet. No emails today.  So it was bleak in the mail box.  I am still grafting the journey tale as we speak, it will go up I promise with all the remaining pictures. Not good news from Nelson, the photographers who lost all my 900 pics, it seems that the staff at the store have wiped the hard drive and there is no chance of me ever seeing them again. Gutted.  1 Week to go gutted, but weather is gorgeous. So much so I cycled to Matamata yesterday to collect the veggies, lovely way to help the tan out I thought.  Mirre and Eutes have parted there way and Eutes now heads North to Auckland.  Mirre is spending a day or two @Christchurch before she flies back to Netherlands.  They e mailed tonight to say that they would pass on their pics to me - reeeeesult.  Greer called to check all is well with me and that I had not left yet. He had the snip today and feels like re enacting the Madness day's of - baggy Trousers until his Aubergines have died down, poor fella.  All good things come to and end I suppose.  The war is still raging on in Iraq as I type this and I am none the wiser as to what is going on.  I suppose if they stop all flights in and out of the country, at least I am in the right place could not think of a better place to be stuck.  Oh well bloggers must fly  Grrrrrrrr

      Well it has been a long time since I wrote anything worthwhile in the blog about my travels to date. So I thought I had better fill in some of the blanks.  I have to go back as far as the 10th I think now; If I repeat myself I am sorry. After spending a night at the hot rocks back packers in Rotorua , I hooked up with Mirre , the dutch girl I had met in Pahia with Rob, she was very pleased that I had actually made the journey down, that evening I went for a brief stroll in the town , a hive of commercial exploitation if ever there was such a place. There is load to see in Rotorua , provided you pay for it , I felt quite objectional about paying for these , and  I believe there is so much natural beauty available for free why pay for such things , these include free fall ( which you can do in most tourist places in NZ ) , Zoiding ( putting yourself inside an inflatable plactic orb and throwing yourself down the hill ) , quadding etc etc.  We passed the evening in the hostel bar, an affiliate of ACB in Auckland , I was fed up with bars and the like and I sure as hell did not travel to the other side of the world to spend my time in bars.  This is where I first met Eudes Cornil , a French chap that Mirre had met since staying in Rotorua , a painfully shy chap from Lille , an MSCE IT consultant, who was travelling alone. All three discussed our travels to date around the globe and he seemed a pleasant enough chap.  Tuesday 11th  After a brief walk around the town, we decided to have breakfast in a little bistro, the rain pelted down, the happy rain continued. Mirre and I had tried to hire a car, one of the $39 a day jobs, and found that there were none available to hire for under $100, reluctantly we agreed it was way over our budget and plopped for 3 days only enough for us to go down south to Wellington at least, where we would reassess our itinery. Whilst at breakfast Eudes asked if it would be okay for him to follow us on our travels. Both Mirre & I looked at each other quizzically and almost at the same time blurted out.  ‘ Why follow us, Why have 2 cars, why don’t we just team up if that was okay and that would make Eudes bill cheaper by 2/3 rds.  It would work out that we would only have to pay $17.5 a day, a hug e saving to all three of us. It was agreed, we munched on breakfast and a flat black, and decided to head out.  I became the tour/venga bus/ happy rain tour translator as neither of my cohorts spoke the relevant native languages of each other, we invented a new language NedFranglais , a combination of Dutch/French & English.  We got to taupo and it was absolutely chucking it down and Taupo is bleak and really not nice when it rains, apparently when it is sunny it is stunning sadly, I was not able to see it this time around maybe next time.  Taupo again is another tourist place where you can do anything and everything if you pay. A few piccies were taken (sadly no one will se any of them). In the drizzle and we decided we would go to Napier to see if we could hit up with Greer Compston , the chappie I had been friendly with on the internet , courtesy of my MP3 site for the last 3 years.  The route between Taupo to Napier (The Heart of the Wine Lands) is absolutely breathtaking, even in the rain. The rolling hills of varying tomes of green, the meandering road, where you can go an hour without seeing anyone, somewhat similar to Brecon and the environs, Awesome.  We passed through many areas that had been used for the LOTR trilogy, quite quite stunning.  How many wows can you have on a road trip, every hill gave us another vantage point, every bridge and river gave us another photo session.  Great care must be taken on all roads, because you never know what is around the corner.  Something that became very obvious on this stretch of the journey, when you have an accident here it is a long way from anywhere.  On one of the more treacherous stretches of the road we happened across a serious damage only RTA ( Job speak – Ed. Slap your self man you are on vacation ). It would be a lorry had gone up the rear end of a van and a trailer and there was a hell of a mess.  No one was injured thankfully; once we had checked that they had called the police and all was well we carried on towards Napier and the Hawkes bay area. Onwards and upward, twisting and turning, wow, wow, wow, click, click, and click.  As the sun started to set, and the sky dissolved into a wall of purple, we crossed the town boundary lines into Napier.  The sheer number of Vineyards you pass en route is phenomenal, acres and acres of the things. It is quite evident that the town was major player in the wine industry.  As we pulled into Napier I called The Greester on the phone for direction and he kindly directed us into the town centre to a place called Archie’s Bunker. Very near the sea front.  When you enter the CBD (Central Business District) , you notice straight away that this area is rightly known for all it’s Art Deco History , all the buildings , all the fonts and titles on their sides , all so typically Art Deco.  They do tours in this town just to view all the buildings of note. If you love this sort of stuff this is a must. Not the normal sort of Kiwi experience, but never the less a real bit of Kiwiana (New word).  Archie’s Bunker a very new and wonderfully clean Backpacker’s hostel, carpeted floors, so very strange & very clean. All the resident’s and staff were very helpful $20 per night.  After booking in unloading the car and getting a bunk in yet another dorm. Cleansed by a hot shower we headed out into the night, so see what we could spy.  A walk along the beachfront, was stunning even at this time of day, although it was damp, the wind and air was warm.  A few piccies in the beach auditorium, of team ‘ Happy rain ‘ we walked into the town famished, we chance upon a Chinese restaurant.  They appeared to be closing up , but a clever female boss , Cue Nancy lam , style person spotted us looking at the carvery , drooling as the staff were clearing up.  ‘ You wanna eat  ‘   The saliva running from our mouth’s must have been that obvious.  ‘ Yes Yes , Oui Oui , Ja  Ja ‘  We piled into the restaurant , and Nancy , stated she would just dismiss the staff and cook for us herself if need be.  We sat and dined on Duck,huge chunks of Duck , Chicken Cashew, Chilli Beef and Black Bean sauce , House Special Rice and fresh Butterfly Prawns all for the very very expensive price of $98 ( £33 ).  She bade us farewell , and we headed out again to see what else was on offer, we came across a Salsa bar that was showing the cricket ( NB Please note I have no interest in the game ) , I called Bloo just because. Then the bar clsed promptly at 2300 hr’s where else was open . We were directed to an Irish bar across the road , typical blokes sort of place.  Drinking over her is not like home where people guzzle , it’s social , in as much we people actually talk to each other without the need to shout.  Most refreshing.  One G & T later we retired for the evening.  What would tomorrow bring ?  Wednesday 12th  A quick call to Greer and he advised us to head out to the mahia penininsula and around the bay.  We did a quick bit of shopping and I bumped into Rollo in his music store, he was single of the week in Smash Hit’s, in the 80’s and the cutting is proudly displayed in his shop., and no surprise a chum of Greer’s , who import’s musical equipment into NZ.  He still thinks we are mad that we managed the whole bay there and back in one day.  It is very hard to put into words, what the day entailed the simplest way is to try it yourself or look on the map to see what we had managed in one day, there and back .  More Wow’s and Click’s all over the place, some Titanic Moment’s   ‘ I am the king of the world ‘ and all that Jazz much to the other guy’s amusement.  On the way back we decide to disappear into the rain forest that fill the area into the hot pools area I the roads.  A beautiful way to end the day , $5 to sit in the woods in a geo thermal pool or the cool running waters and reflect on what you had done for the day.  On the drive back we had been called by Greer , who laughed his head off to think we were going there and back in a day.  ‘ You are truly a lunatic , W@tchy ‘  Greer told us he had spent loads of his childhood here , surfing and one visit to this bay would make it quite apparent why.  Huge waves , uncluttered beaches and views, loads of space ,absolutely amazing.  Greer invited us all around for the evening to finally meet up , and dine and pass the evening with a selection of the regions wines.  The other’s were amazed that I had never met this chap and he wanted all three of us to pop around and be his guest’s.  The other’s did not wish to impose on him so much and decided that we should dine in  Napier before we headed over to Tea Wanga  and the gannet  colony and home of the Greerster.  On his and Rollo’s recommendation, we stopped at a pizza place in Napier, stonking food.  You would never get a fesh sea scallop and garlic pizza lijke I had in the UK , MMMMM.  We purchased some gift’s for the Compston fella’s family , and set out 11 km’s down the road we entered Te Awanga.  Dam no signal on the phone, I tried in vain to contact the boy, we drove up and down around an around this small little town . So near yet so far I was gutted.  The other’s had sensed my disappointment and tried to appease me by suggesting we sit on the beach and watch the moon and view Napier across the bay, yet more click click moments.  A brief moment of madness on video introduce the world to Grrrr , the genuine Kiwiana green turtle explorer , a thread that lasted the whole of the journey with Eudes & Mirre.  I await the video with baited breath.  Sad & wazzed off we headed back to Napier, to the Irish Bar we had frequented the night before, 1 Guiness & 1 G & T later, we decided to call it a day and head for the hills to bed.  A truly bad end to the day.  Thursday 13th.  Bleep Bleep .  I was awoken by the sound of a text message arriving on my mobile.  Much to the annoyance of the other dorm member’s.  I checked briefly , it was from Greer .  ‘ Sorry about last night , signal over my way is somewhat bad , have you left town yet if not do you wana touch base for coffee ‘  ‘ Reeeeesult’  Quick as a flash , I called the boy   ‘ yep that’s fine 0930 hrs town centre’  The other’s awoke, and packed all the belongings as we were heading out today to go the long way south to Wellington.  I told them I was heading out for coffee and where I would be if they wanted to hitch up.  A brief walk I into the town centre to the coffee house he had suggested and met all the staff that knew him well.  ‘ Greer , has Cappuccino ‘  A short time later.  ‘W@tchy ‘  I was greeted by a very short , well short by standard’s at least , slightly older man , although , he looked 10 times younger than me male of athletic build , with surfer’s curly hair very reminiscent of a the INXS period of Kiwiana rock.  A thoroughly good egg.  We chatted about music and the cock up’s and the fact that we glad to touch base at last    We could have chatted for hour’s and I will look forward to the next time we meet.  The guy’s joined me and took photos for me for the website. (all lost now )  He recommended we head south via Te Mata peak.  We bade each other farewell , see you later . Chuffed we had touched base towards Te Mata peak.  What can I say that has not already been said about Te Mata.  WOW WOW WOW AWESOME.  Click . Click Click  x 21  Then we Headed out south to Wellington, a long beautiful meandering journey, via Wimbledon and the place with the world’s longest (longer even than the pace in Wales – fact)  We arrived on the outskirts’ of Upper Hutt at the peaks’ at sunset.  Click , Click Click.  Stunning/  Then down into Wellington, grabbed a bed in ‘ Rowena’s Hostel for the night ‘ ready for our journey south, we retired early, but not after first meeting yet more traveller’s who had actually cycled 800 km in 2 week’s in the South Island and whetted our appetite’s even more.   What was to come changed everything .

       There are some REALLY nice book shops in Auckland. They all have very nice coffee shops in amd so, naturally, I have spent a fair amount of time both browsing through books, and supping coffee.   Many of the books are unavailable in the Uk (I asked) One of them entitled "The meaning of life" is a humorous little book . Each page has a large photo of an animal of some sort in  a funny position, or dressed up, or something like that. And each page has one line that makes up the entire book and thus, the message of the book.   Whilst it is obviously best read with the pictures to go with it, I thought I would relate the contents of the message in an e mail. It made me laugh, and seemed quite appropriate in the circumstances. Read it if you will. I liked it and thought some of you might too.      The Meaning of life.     Halt! Whoa! Stop right there! Before you read any further theres something you really should know.   You may have opened this little book expecting it to be filled with answers, but (surprise suprise) it's actually a book about questions.   This may not be what you wanted to hear.   Most people dont like questions- they like answers. And if they dont get answers straight away, their eyes immediately start to glaze over.   Pretty soon they're off in a lovely day dream about dancing cup cakes, singing turnips and soaking in a bath tub filled with warm vanilla custard.   So, and this is important, if you feel like saying, "Questions? Pfffff. Who needs them?"   then this is your last chance to throw this book away. I repeat, this is your last chance.   THE MEANING OF LIFE.   No matter how you look at it, life is strange.   Very strange.   For example, it's an indisputable fact that we are all made of the precise same substance as the most intelligent, creative, magnificent life forms in the entire universe.   Furthermore, we are composed of the exact same atomic matter as the mightiest mountains on this planet and the brightest stars in the galaxy.   Of course, this is also true for potatoes, snails, and meatloaf- perhaps thats why there's so much about life that doesnt seem to make a great deal of sense.   For starters, why are we so overly impressed by and obsessed with objects and achievements of immense scale?   When it is actually the tiny little things that, when put together, make big things possible?   Why do we try to create our own little worlds so we have the illusion of being completely in contro of our entire existennce,   When we know with absolute certainty that we are not?   Why  do we go on and on about individuality being the very essence of who we are,   and then accept a degrading level of conformity in virtually every facet of our lives?   Why do children believe in fairies, but grown ups don't?   And why do we get so hung up on what we don't agree on, when it's our differences that make life interesting?   After all, half the world is upside down, so theres absolutely no reason why we would agree on everything.   Why do we feel drawn together as a species,   Yet we steadily build up defensive barriers around our innermost feelings and beliefs so we can never be truly close to anyone?   As a species we are obsessed with superficial appearance.   We all have filters on, so we mostly see only what we want to see. When you finally open your eyes, you may be shocked at the obscured way you have been viewing the world to suit your own little plans.   With those filters removed, you can take a closer look into yourself and ask objective questions about the universe and your place in it. In other words, the meaning of life.   So, what is life all about? Well, you often hear that "Life is a journey", but a journey to where, exactly?   There are those who say that life has no purpose: it just "is." Whoa, that's just so "deep!"   then, there are those who say that we're simply here to have a family. After all, the desperate need to replace ourselves is etched into the genetic map of every living thing.   However, this means that our entire existence is driven by our primitive sexual urges. Okay, sure, a long weekend maybe, but our entire existence? I dont think so.   ALL THESE IDEAS SOUND COMPLETELY STUPID!!!!   The only theme that resonates throughout the numerous popular life theories is love. Love, in all its fragile forms, is the one powerful, enduring force that brings real menaing to our everyday lives.   Of course, Im not talkiing about romantic, "kissy-kissy" love, although that is pretty powerful stuff in itself.   It's well documented that a broken heart feels far more painful than squeezing lemon juice over a deep paper cut.   but the love I mean is the fire that burns inside us all, the inner warmth that prevents our soul from freezing in the winters of despair. It's the love of life itself.   Its the voice that says "Celebrate life, be creative!" It brings with it the passion and understanding that some things in life are worth dying for, but there is so much more worth living for.   It encourages us to greet each other the same way we greet an old friend at the airport, to embrace opportunities to express ourselves in a way that makes us feel glad we exist.   This love of life leads us to help others simply because it feels great to contribute to those around us.   We all know how wonderful it feels to be a rock for our family and friends.   But , as good as it sounds, and as much as "you're here to live the life you love" rings true, it stil brings up a whole pile of sticky questions.   Specifically: Why exactly are YOU here? What is it that YOU love?   People who dont ask themselves these questions invariably go throughlife wondering why it isn't a lot more fun.   The truth is that often we're so focused on what we are doing that we lose sight of where we are going.   We get caught up in an avalanche of fears and desires that propel us into a race that we can't possibly win.   so we rush, rush, rush to get to a certain ideal point in our life, and then what?   It's just like when you drive all the way to the shop, get out of the car, and then cant remember what you came for.   So many of us start off dreaming about a wonderful life that is wild and free,   But thats usually a long way from where we actually end up.   Sadly, we often discover this fact right at the end, when it's too late. You can't start all over again.   Of all the awful feelings that make you feel sick to your stomach, nothing feels half as bad as knowing you had a chance to do what you truly love, and you didn't take it.   So, what is your lifes passion? What were you put on this earth to do? The answer to these questions will unlock the great mystery of life: It's as big as they come.   Here are a few hints that might help you get on the right track.   first, no-one is going to tell you about it. It's like walking around all day with a sign on your back that says "Kick me". You must discover it for yourself.   It's also highly unlikely that one day you'll suddenly be bathed in bright light and your lifes purpose will be laid out in a divine vision.   And it's guaranteed you wont find it on television.   The best way is to spend some quality time alone, asking yourself the tough questions.   This exercise is not that hard, and it's all about being honest. It's as easy as "Raise your hand if you feel you could get more out of life."   For some people this will simply be a case of seeking out the moments in their life that are beautiful and true and then building a plan around them.   For others it may feel as if they are staring into an abyss.   If you ask the big questions and listen carefully to your heart, you will eventually hear destiny call you.   A little voice- call it your conscience, your inner self, or your internal mother-in-law - will always tell you the truth if you are prepared to hear it.   At first you may only become aware of how your life has been stuck in a rut. (Hey, join the club!)   Then you may realise what you really want, but you just can't quite make it happen.   Pretty soon though, it will hit you right between the eyes. Just like when you're halfway to the beach and suddenly remember you left the iron on at home.   And when you know, or even suspect you know, what you should be doing with your life, then do it! Take a wild leap in the dark if you have to.   Then hit the ground running because you don't have a second to lose.   In spite of our feelings of invincibility and immortality,   Our existence is far more tenuous than we might think.   Place your hand over your chest and feel your heartbeat. That is actually your life clock ticking, counting down the moments you have left. One day it will stop. That is 100 percent guaranteed, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.   So you can't afford to throw away a single precious second. go after your dreams with energy and passion, or you may as well stand back and watch them wash down the drain.   If you waste your life sitting on the fence, you'll end up going nowhere in the brief time you have left. (And then of course, there's the dangerous risk of splinters in delicate regions.)   As they say, "You can't cross a chasm in two small leaps." It takes courage and commitment to live your dreams.   The truth is, we are all born with potential greatness and blessed with numerous opportunities to soar to dizzzzying new heights.   But, sadly, many of us are too lazy, too concerned about what others might think, or too afraid of change to ever stretch our wings and realise our tremendous talents.   Its so important that you just do your own thing - whatever makes you truly happy - and do it as best you can. It doenst matter what it is.   the only thing that matters is that you feel great about what you're doing.   Bear in mind that whatever you do, mistakes are part of life. so don't wast time kicking yourself for the past.   don't stall or stress over whether you're doing the right thing. You'll always know the answer in your heart.   Rather than be discouraged, always remember that rejection and resistance are almost guaranteed when you are doing something very important and very special.   When you set out to live your dreams, lots of people (including those who love you the most) will try to hold you back.   In this world there are many miserable pessimists who have given up their dreams and will tell you, "You're wasting yoiur time- You'll never make it."   You may well be surrounded by people who secretly want you to achieve less or even fail completely  just so they don't look bad. "Forget about it", they'll say. "Its not worthit and it's not right for you anyway."   So it's important to understand that following your own path is incredibly rewarding, but it's definitely not easy.   Like everyone else you will have some days that are better than others.   Occaisionally everything may seem like a total disaster area.   And you'll start to listen to your detractors and doubt yourself. "Why oh why, didn't I keep my job selling hot dogs?"   But whatever happens, Just hang on.   Remember that everybody struggles at times. It's incredibly draining to live throught the day doing something you really don't enjoy or even care about.   But if you follow your dreams, at least you will exhaust yourself doing what you love most.   Now, you may not think that this will measure up to much in the global scheme of things. But believe me, it does.   When you get the most out of your life, savouring every last drop,   it will transform everything about you from ordinary to extraordinary.   When you do what you love, you can pull back the bed sheets every morning feeling excite4d about beginning another day.   And you'll be filled with heartfelt joy that is highly contagious.   Just when you start laughing out loud,   and you make someone else start laughing,   and then someone else,   Until you are all laughing so hard that your eyes water, you get terrible stomach cramps, it's hard to breathe, and you can't even stand up.   but, best of all, you will inspire someone else to go after their dreams,   and that, my friend, is how you change the world!   You know what? Even if you make big mistakes, if you're wrong about almost everything, you'll still enjoy an amazing, fun-filled adventure,   You will go to sleep at night knowing you gave your all and made a difference.   and wake up each day looking forward to a future that is as beautiful and exciting as you can imagine.   You know something else? if you just listen to your heart and use your head,   You'll never be wrong.     The meaning of life.     xx

       MORAL DILEMMA OF THE DAY         Fellow NATO Allies !     You are the President of the U.S.A. and you've just learned that there is an asteroid headed for France that will wipe out their entire country. It is scheduled to hit about 2.30 a.m. in just two days time from now. You have sufficient ships and military personnel nearby to evacuate them safely, but they are on stand-by in case of war with Iraq.           Your question: do you set the VCR to record the asteroid hitting France, or do you stay up to watch it live?

      It was a horrendous day  All 900 , yes 900 of my pictures that I have taken over the last couple of weeks to compliment , my web blog have been lost.

Well at least he tried to raise a smile.   I am in Hamilton now in a motel trying to wind down before I head back to the shire.  I tried to call Mia in UK t ceck to see how she is but woking station is not he quietest place in the world when you are trying to make a call so maybe she will try agin later.  Eric just called to say he is having a wail of a time being a ' daddy ' on the kid's summer camp and we will hit up on Friday.  They have lost a ewe and a Hercules , a little black bull , nice chappie , he got tangled in the electric fence and died , so i will be heading out to help Micheelle tomorrow , nope stop that , what is it with theses Kiwis , I have just received  a text from Auckland .

       From Fridays paper ... NZ police raid British forces for new blood By Russell Jenkins    PHIL WALKER has survived his last shift policing the streets of Manchester, as well as an emotional leaving party. But Sergeant Walker, 42, is not retiring. Later this month he will join a mass exodus of British policemen to New Zealand.  He is one of several dozen experienced officers from metropolitan forces enticed to hand in their papers by the prospect of a fresh start a world away from the violence of Britain’s inner cities.   New Zealand Police have signed up 78 officers, selected from hundreds who responded to a clandestine recruitment drive last summer. It relied on word of mouth and disenchantment. Greater Manchester Police is losing 13, the highest number from any force, to the dismay of senior officers.   Mr Walker has put his modern detached house in Hyde up for sale. As a keen walker, he is looking forward to exchanging the foothills of Saddleworth Moor for wilderness, white beaches, volcanoes and glaciers.   He flies south in two weeks. His wife, Janette, 41, will join him with their daughter, Rachel, 15, when she has completed her GCSE examinations. They hope to find a house on the coast close to Auckland.   “I said to my wife if I didn’t do this now, I never would, because I would be too old,” he said. He had not been thinking about a move but now realises that he was at a low ebb when he heard about the recruiting campaign.   He had spent 15 months as a custody sergeant in Manchester. He said that the dismal experience had begun to affect him and put a strain on his marriage.   In 13 years with the force he has suffered a “few knocks and bumps”. In 1996 he wrestled with a man wielding a carving knife and Samurai sword, who had stabbed two people, to free a WPC taken hostage. He was also in the front line for the Oldham riots, at one time among a group of five officers cut off from their colleagues and facing 500 rioting youths.   In New Zealand, even senior ranks have to start as constables, but salaries reflect experience. Mr Walker’s probationer’s course will be short and he has been promised a fast-track promotion if he comes up to scratch.   “The total package, including the pension, amounts to $55,800,” he said. “To convert to pounds sterling you have to divide by three but they tell me that you can get for a dollar there what you get for a pound here. It goes a lot further.”   He will also be able to buy a lot for the £210,000 he hopes to get for his own house. The family has been looking at a five-bedroom, £160,000 house set in three acres outside Auckland.   His wife, who holds an Equity card, is hoping that the change will inspire her to fulfil an ambition to become a full-time actress. She has been a regular extra on Coronation Street, Brookside and Emmerdale. Rachel’s enthusiasm for the project was also crucial to the move.   A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said that for the transferring officers and their families it was a lifestyle choice. “I am sure that emigrating to a country as beautiful as New Zealand is a fantastic opportunity,” she said. “It seems like a high number all at once but, over time, these things tend to balance themselves out. While it is disappointing these officers have decided to leave the force, GMP has a successful, ongoing recruitment drive. ”   Mr Walker spent much of the weekend packing furniture and cleaning his lawnmower. “Everything has to be spotless for the move,” he said.   He and some of his emigrating colleagues have already bought their tickets to watch the All Blacks take on the England rugby union team at Wellington on June 14. “Some say they will be supporting their newly adopted country,” he said. “I will still be shouting for England. My future lies in New Zealand, but I will miss the old country. I know I will.”   Michael Todd, the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, recently welcomed 567 young recruits into the force, which aims to employ 600 new officers.   The total number of officers has been edging up in recent years. Last year’s annual report shows total uniformed manpower at 7,131, a rise of about 200 officers since 1998. An injection of cash recently agreed by the police authority for the coming year should mean, for the first time, that the complement of officers will rise considerably over the 7,000 mark.   Senior officers are happy with overall numbers but acknowledge that the real problem lies in recruiting and retaining officers from ethnic minorities in a force branded by the last chief constable as “institutionally racist”.   The recent round of resignations will mean gaps in front-line policing, especially at a time when management is running high-profile operations targeting street crime.   A different beat in the South Pacific  The Royal New Zealand Police offers what it describes as a “varied, challenging and rewarding” career. Its 8,800 officers police the largely rural islands, and vast tracts of wilderness, in the South Pacific. Only Auckland and the Counties Manukau District offers anything like the same kind of metropolitan policing challenges that the officers are used to. Even so, recent incidents include a stolen car in a smash, a renewed appeal in an unsolved murder and praise for an off-duty officer who jumped in to save someone from a tiger mauling at Wellington Zoo. Things have quietened down since the gold rushes of the 1860s in Otago and Canterbury.   More compelling attractions are lower house prices, a secure future and comfortable lifestyle in a country where English is spoken and the terrain takes in white beaches, volcanoes, deserts, rain forests, glaciers and alpine lakes.   The force is assessing a further 13 candidates and hopes that 80 recruits will begin training in April. The acting national manager for recruitment, Inspector Janette Smidt, said: “Our laws are based on British law, therefore the skills of the officers are easily transferable while New Zealand gains experienced officers who wish to continue their career here.”

      I have returned from  my adventures in the South Island , I had to bail big style , too much stuff was going on in my head.  I have got much too write about , but I will have to chill out first.  I was seeing too much at too fast a speed , and It was too much information and I was suffering information overload.  There will be many things that come out of this trip.  Thankfully so will I.  A bit of  a wake up call scared me , although we had not been doing anything stupid.  The car fell off the road on Saint Patrick's day , and my whole life flashed before my eye's . Eutes was very  worried that this was the main reason I bailed , but It's not at all.  It was just a catalyst and I made a conscience decision to head on out.  I will fill in all the missing bit's laters as and when I have time.  $94 later I was  dropped off @ Greymouth Station and took a ride on the trans alpine scenic express and did some serious wind  down and thinking .  The views were great and beyond belief , but I had become aware of so   much stuff in my life having to be sorted out I decided that I needed to do it alone and do it properly not half heartedly , I know now where I would go again in the brief road trip and where and where not to go again.  Some 5 hours later I was back in Christchurch and raced  to the airport and took a flight   back to Auckland , not some where that I wanted to be but I would rather have been there than be stuck in a new town at 9pm at night seeking out a potential night stop.  I managed to bump into Rob @ ACB , and bumped into Mark & Rachel , who said I could flop the night.  I collapsed exhausted and headed fro the shower dressed and cleaned my cracked feet  and all the sand fly bites and bruises and grazes that I had collected with gay abandon in the journey and retired for the evening.  I know that is a bit of a come down e mail , but it is how I felt at the time , traveling is  a voyage of self discovery ,  the minute's , hour's , day's  , month's & year's  I have spent in front of VDU screen's drives you to despair  and I needed to get away from it all , this was the  ideal place.  As this goes to press , I have finally been able to get into my e-mail ,  all have stirred me somewhat and I thank those of you that have written , in both positive and negative way's they have helped pave the way for future foundations to be built. I have over the the last couple of week's done load's of soul searching and decided to progress my life .  Reading back through the journal I feel that it has been a brutal and frank writing of what I was feeling at the time and hence reflects that.  Writing journals' from internet cafe's that do not work is not  fun and added to the stress the strain and the absolutely awful typing but I am sure you are used to that now.  I am hoping to catch a bus again down to Matamata today , who know where that will lead me , I will compose all my thought's and reflect on life love & unity.  I am going to learn it all over again , sometime soon hopefully.  I will write in all the bit's and bob's later.  There is so much more that I will have to include in the journal to  fill you in but I feel a while in the shire will  give me the time and the place to write it from and   hopefully get some pictures up.   Love to  ALL  my readers

      Its sundya today , I have been soooooooooooo busy over the last couple of day's and to be truthful You guy's would have been as well.  Well I hit up with the living legend that is the Greer man , top bloke nice to have finally hooked up with him after 3 years. Had some chin wags and some coffee's before leaving Nelson , which seem's so long ago now.  The journey down from Nelson was the longest one today , I did my normal  thing I lasted about an hour or so going , wow wow wow then I became increasingly aware that wow was being overused.  ( Te mata etc wineries needs to be expanded on other wise Frau Briggs will Kill me ......... Awesome )  The weather has lightened up and it was a scorcher , so much so I got that suinburnt window arm thing  off to a tee. Hot cannot describe it .  Wow wow wow.  We went via the place with the worlds longest name ( Ed please stick piccie here )  I took photos of the beautiful cobalt electric sky , I took photos of the clouds just because.  It was that sort of trip , I become increasinly annoyed with the boody rain , somewhat reminiscent of any of those cambodian./ viet nam . tour of duty sort of movies  , you get the gist.   We went to wimbledon , because the others wanted to see if it had a tennis court , wimbledon consisted of a tavern that's it, next.  The long and winding road towards Wellingotn saw us viewing some of the most beautiful places you can imagine, I was fortunate to head into Upper Hutt ,and to the view point and watch and piccie the sunset . awesome , lens flare worked a treat.   ( Ed - you realise Frau Briggs will want all these pics uploaded , like now , hurry up )   Wellington , I never really got to see but stayed in yet another hostel  laters time is running out on pooeter  mwahh mwahh

      Well returned exhausted after a day up around the Hawkes bay to Mahia and beyond some 2 1/2 hrs driving.  ( greer thinks we are mad to attempt it in one day , but we  did and survived it all )  Bought some new tunes for the road trip , I amd fed up of M's trance vibe , although it is always good going out music .  A day of mixed emotions really.  Great scenery , quite quite breath taking.  I have learn't to accept that without the happy rain , there would be no verdant green pastures all around.  The coast line was quite spectacular.  The wave were killers of a size.  Miriam & Eudes are arguing over the email typing speed.  We are all really tired and have just this second retured from trying to locate  an internet chum of mine called Greer comspton from my MP3 day's  Apologies for poor spelling, I have no access to a WP program and the lovely F7 button , only notepad , I will edit it all later sometime when I put in the piccies ( 777 now )  I think he had gone to bed , i am really annoyed that after travelling to the other side of the world , we were unable to touch base.  I have had several calls today from Billy lawrence (PC from UK ) , who states that 3 of the Brit Bobbies , have pulled out of emigrating and now that leaves me top of the list , If i want to take up the offer.   maybe I will never return the Uk .   This is some serious Headmeltdown.  A life changing decision to be made in the next 48 hours not much pressure really.  I will have a drink of the local equivalent of cider and think about it.  Tomorrow we head south to Wellington.  ( Ed - Hot Pool s. Turtle Watch , Pizza place for simons gourmet records along with the psycho chinese woman , Titanic Poses on the Cliffs and damaged feet )  Laters dudes  love you all  Some serious thinking to be done over the next 48 hours.  Nz is indeed a land of blessings in disguise , I am not board at all from the views of quite huge proportions.

      Oh well  , I have woken fresh as a little tiny flower. Again It is raining but we are resigned to the rain at the moment.  Miriam says everywhere else is dry apart from where ever we are going.  A quick rendition of Chico chico the rain maker , was said in jest some day's ago for all the farmer's in waikato and boy has it rained since.  This road trip is very very differant , a english bobby , a dutch special need's teacher and a dutch it bo from one of the largest swiss media companies.  Yesterday was kind of a bizarre day , I could not bear the though of wasting day's sitting around in the rain , as has been my way over the last couple of day's.  I had made the decision to move on rain day's and therefore I would not be wasting anyday doing nothing on those day's.  If I kept that policy , I would always be moving every day at the current time.  Miriam and I were going to hire a car in Rotarua but everything was done and all the so called special offers of $39 do not really exist.  It would have have ended up costing some where in the region of almost $300 no way jose.  Bizarrely , Eudes who had bumped into Miriam the night before suggested over breakfast if he could tag along and follow us where ever we were going.  A rather strange idea really , why hire 2 cars , when one would suffice.  A little bit of breakfast laterand the decision was set in place , we would now swell our ranks by another one.  Eudes joined the rabnks after a hearty breakfast , we headed out on the next part of the journey.  Miriam decided to go shopping in the super market , she made the statement that she had not been shopping in NZ and that was quite evident when we got inside the supermarket.   This girl loves shopping , verything with sugar or chocolate in she wanted.  Eudes & I just wanted a can of pop , but oh no shopping with a girlie is never that easy , she wanted plastic cups to drink from  tissue's etc etc.  $30 lighter we headed out.  Rte #5 across land towards Taupo.  I nodded off and missed the bloo and green lakes.  I woke uo it was stil raining and we stoped at Haka Falls , we did spy a sign that said Hydro Power Station scenic walk 2 Hr's, and we all thought  let's do that , there is no way it would be 2 hrs to do a walk that is obviously for old people.  Oh how wrong we we were , whilst the walk was scenic and all things nice , it started raining again , hapy rain we thought, Smiles on faces throughout the rain poured and poured and poured and the forest resembled the scenes from any 1980's Vietnam movie , like tour of duty.  It rained and rained and rained but we laughed and jollied our way around the sceneic walk , at last there was a light at the end of the tunnel.  We spied the sign , it took exactly 2 hrs to walk.  We thought we had gone full circle to come back to the car , we were soaked and cold through and all we wanted to do was get into the car.  Oh no , nothing so simple the river had twisted and turned and we were 12 Km's from our car and it was getting dark.  A passing french man in a was stopped dead in his track's by miraima , I said she must have flashed her boob's to get him to stop so quickly , she denied this but with alll our languages, Eudes stepped in grabbed a lift back to our car and ten minutes later he returned and then we headed out.  It would have taken ages to get back to the car park , thank  god we had miriam.  ( Ed - Dam opening needs including here and man with the missing finger picking his nose )  We headed out to taupo and it was still raining , we all decided that it was noting much to right home about so we headed off down Route 5 towards Napier , wow wee what views .

      Hmm interesting night. It rained and rained and rained. Miriam Is trying to sort out the car whilst I gallivant elsewhere. This town is very very quiet, and I think I would tire of it rapidly, If it were not for the excursions.  I do not think I could do another night here , the dorms stinks and is by far the worst I have encountered there is no cheery vibe here.  It is a water hole that is all I can really say about Rotarua sorry to be harsh.  Any way check out time looms so must fly.  Like this entry my stay here is definitely short.  Rotarua very very very tedious , not a place I would ever come back to.  The higlight was the tiny little noodle bar and the fact I am hoping to leave today.

      Well, It has been a while since I wrote some stuff in the blog.  After a great weekend up in the Bay of islands courtesy of ' The Pipi Patch Hostel '. The sister hostel to ACB Auckland.  Ali's 30th birthday went down a storm loads of Vodka jellies; green of course as she was Irish and insisted that we had to have green everywhere top lady.  It rained a lot and I did not give stuff, I was not in the U.K. and that was all that mattered.  I did have a downer at the weekend but a mate in the U.K. helped me out,  Cheers you know who you are .  For those of you that received phone calls, it was not a real intention to wind you up.  Up there in the North of North Island it truly is back to basics.  Cape Reinga was Cape Fear.  Quite quite bleak but worth the view met so many lovely people who I apologise if I cannot remember at this moment in Time.    As soon as I arrived in paihia, I became the legend that is now GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!  After the lovely emily from awesome could not read my writing, I was christened Grrrrrrr and boy has that stuck far better than Queenie or Stan.  Everywhere I go I seem to bump into people, who I have never met, going  Gday  Grrrrr  Hi Grrrrrrr  I obviously made a good impact people, for all the right reasons. Thanks guy¡¯s, It's all down to you guy's for providing the goods.  It was a case of light my blue touch paper and stand well well back.  I have arrived in Rotorua today to be greeted.  Hey Guy's look its Grrrrrrr  My face lit up.  Of exceptional note I must thank two very very very exceptional characters who made my visit absolute tiptop bonza.  In no particular order   Jaime from Awesome, mate you are the dogs' b's.  This bloke cut's all the usual rep crap and get's straight to the heart of it and does not oversell anything, he has to be one of the most honest blokes I have ever met as a rep.  The trip to the hole in the rock was truly wonderful just what Mark (Globe manager) & Rob needed after that long journey.  Wait till you see the video of me being lunatic.  Secondly, Phil from Awesome, I now believe that there is someone more passionate about life than I am.  This bus driver / guide / font of knowledge happy happy giant character of a man really knows how to be a proper guide.  He is soooooo proud of his kiwiness it seeps out of his pores, nothing and I mean nothing was too much for this monster of a guy.  Thank's bro  When you rock back to U.K. Phil, just call Grrrrrrrr  01483 773683  The first one's definately on me.  Last night was a rock and roll night Evelyn the mad Dutch women rolled back into town and promptly became the rock chick she is the room was trashed and I left in the early hours of the am to get the long journey back down to Auckland, it rained so much, I could really not face another day in Auckland, so I thought if it was going to rain I may as well travel on a bus to Rotorua and hook up with a girlie called Miriam , I met in Paihia to share a car and start travelling together, Rob has buddied up with a another Chick , Barbara from Eric Land m, but she is a nice girlie , they are staying in ACB (Ed this needs expanding somewhat , Bobby the cat , jessie the absent room  mate return's Ange & Sarah finally quit Paihia after 4 months )  Miriam the Dutch Girlie was happy to see me (Mad bloody girl) We are planing to hire a car and bum out for a while.  In the middle of nowhere, all being well I will see the hot pools tonight, and head out to Taupe tomorrow.  Bugger!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hello by Lionel Richie has come on and I remember all of you guy's and think of wasted hour¡¯s at Fleet Country Club.  time to leave today.  What no e-mails from all my chum¡¯s, Was it really worth me coming in to check out stuff on the net.  Must go   ( NB - Ed note Marti the nude hostel worker, Sand Surfing with Phil and setting a new land speed record and narrowly becoming a road kill in the quicksand s of 90 mile Beach , The kauri forest the little Japanese girl's that grrrrrrr 'd at me )

      Well firstly I will apologise , no I won’t , I am on holiday.  For not giving you all the fix that you wanted over the last couple of day’s since I left Auckland.  I am having a bloody great time , and as I thought Hobbiton aka Matamata is the centre of middle earth.  A sight for sore eyes.  The film does it no justice whatsoever , and I have seen it daily over the last couple of day’s since my move out to the big smoke.  If it is extreme Kiwi you seek in New Zealand , then Matamata is not the place, this is like the Café del mar of New Zealand , everything is on chill.  The pace is slow and almost at a standstill , in this rural bit of the North Island.  It is the country and as such there is very limited super highway links for electronic  communication  in the form of the internet.  It does not mean however that the people are Red Neck type’s , not at all , they are all a huge community and people from all over  this area know each other and regularly chat all over the place , face to face and not via a poxy  VDU screen , Something that then UK has long since forgotten  The ISP that the Tanner QGM residence uses is a very good service and they get the emails daily like everyone else , but the 56 K modem rarely clocks in over 38 K.  Somewhat different to the  Internet Café’s of Auckland.  I was sooo chuffed to see the guy’s collect me from ACB , they have changed so very very much , not in as much that I or even yourselves would not know them as they were.  They are so so chilled relaxed and very very happy of the big lifestyle change they made by emigrating her 2 years ago.  They are as warm and loving as ever they were before , but their lifestyle is wonderful Relaxed chilled and away from the smoke the racing car’s , The Tanner’s are in their element in this little bit of heaven they are lucky  to call ‘ Home ‘  I was also very lucky to be sharing the experience of the Tanners Kingdom with an old chum, whom I had met via them both some 10 years earlier. Sarah B , one of Michelle & Eric’s chums from SA, a fellow medical sister from Joburg.  Boy oh boy if the first week was a chill out , the first couple of day’s at Cedar Lodge and all thing’s in the Waikato region , blew that chill out of the water , this place was the ice cabinet of chilled.  Michelle said that the journey would be some 2 hours drive out of Auckland but that flew past and  I am more than convinced it did not last that long at all.  Michelle used to be the Nicki Lauda of driving in the UK ( In my humble opinion , that is ) , And what did surprise me straight away was that she hated the idea of driving in town now,  you could tell that the city was not the sort of place she chose willingly to be in and hated trying to navigate her way out of Auckland and onto Highway #1 , south bound to ‘ The Shire ‘.  The drive down was great once out of the city New Zealand become it’s own unique world , the road’s were clear all the way and the rout was so easy to follow , I fi had to drive again  in this country , when I next come over , I know I will it will be a doddle to find.  Route 1 takes you south towards Hamilton ( where Michelle works’ in the ICU of the hospital , a hour’s drive from Matamata ) , you go along winding sweeping roads , and the scenery blow’s your mind , it was to me like a remix  of Brecon Beacon’s vs. Natal province vs. Maine , no one place has all this natural beauty.  You go through Huntley  , famous apparently , although  for no other reason than having Twin towers of 150m tall , a  pace easily forgotten.  The mighty Waikato flows all the way south  and sustains this beautiful rural region of NZ , why does everyone say ‘ Go to the South Island  , the North is boring , I have only seen the North so far and that has blown my mind and I have seen so little , the tourist’s never come to this region as there is nothing to do apparently . What I think they actually mean is that this area is unspoilt by commercial exploitation and loud and noisy bars and nightclubs.  There is definitely something for every one over here , both  Sarah and I agreed that Auckland whilst very nice and much better than London or Joburg , is not somewhere I would rush to live in , when if you travel 1 hour out of town you would be in heaven. It’s food for thought.  Hamilton was instantly forgettable , nothing exciting about it what so ever Bland Bland Bland , bring on the country side please.  When we approached the outskirt’s of Matamata , it was a sea of Green, the rain that I had really started to hate in the city of sails’ , over the last couple of day’s , had apparently released the drought that had parched the land’s down here ,and had breathed new life into the grass and tundra of the area .  A huge sea of flowing green hills and pastures filled the area as far as the eye could see.  No wonder Peter Jackson ,had decided this was the ideal home for Hobbiton.  The Tanners live just outside Matamata in a place called Hinuera a quite beautiful place , with views that tease all your sense’s .  The Hinuera stones that you can see from estate , the Hobbiton set , that is being exploited to the full over the next door neighbour’s garden ( @ $50 dollars it is a complete rip off  , run by some shady property developer and is not really worth it as only some of the actual set remains )  When  we pulled into the drive both Sarah and I could not believe our eye’s . This was not a house with a small amount of land this was like a bloody tropical resort.   It was huge , the picture that I had acquired from the internet , when they first moved does not even remotely do Cedar \Lodge justice , It is quite simply stunning , the house is only a little e feature of  Tannerdom.  Paddock’s surround the wooden house nestled into the hillside , full of sheep & cow’s this was all theirs . It is truly beautiful.  Eric had been his normal very talented self and restyled the house extended it ,and managed to sink a huge swimming pool elegantly decked in the rear of the house ,  a grand tour revealed that there was not only the family home here , but a very substantial guest house at the rear of the main house , which has been housing various guest’s over the last couple of months , the latest one’s being Michelle’s parents.  When I got to sit on the deck after all the greetings had been done and all the hug’s had been passed out.  The polo’s and custard creams went down a storm by the way .   I viewed the landscape that separates Cedar Lodge from ‘ Hobbiton Village ‘ , It can be best visualised , by looking at the standard Windows XP Desktop wallpaper. you know the one with the green hills and bright blue sky with clouds in it.  I had arrived in ‘ The  Shire ‘  Reeeeeeeesult  The Waikato beer that was cracked open to announce our arrival was just the start.      I am sorry I am writing this late, but time is not wasted like it is in Britain watching the forum.  ( I will include other bits and bobs as and when I get the time to complete paragraph’s )  ( Ed – Note to self include , fractured finger , hoof in the ear ,  clipping worming and slotting sheep , The Ice Cream shop , laughing late into the night , snoring under the stars . walking in the rain just to get wet on purpose , Hobbiton sign , buying Tuah , The new ram , offal holes  , Mount Monganui and the day  out at the hot spars )  Later’s big love to you all.  I am off to the deck to kick back and drink some gorgeous red wine   I do not feel guilty that you are already thinking about going back to work tomorrow.  tan is coming on treat

      Briggsy write's better than me . so if you would care to know what's going on go to me   urlLink Quest 4 Aragorn .   I don't really feel up to writing today. CBA Day.   How To Give The Last-Minute Gift of Blog  By Biz Stone  Okay, it's officially the last minute and you forgot to get your sister's roommate a gift. You're going to their holiday party tonight and you can't show up empty handed. What do you do? Fear not gentle bloggers, you'll have a great gift. The gift of blog.  What friend, family member, or colleague wouldn't want a beautiful new Blogger blog. Don't they know that Blogger is "The fast, easy, and free way to publish and share your information online?" Well it is. And it's damn sexy too. The following are instructions for how to set up a brand new, free, Blogger blog for someone as a gift and how to make it seem like you actually gave it some real thought. The giving-it-some-thought part is key to any successful last-minute gifting strategy.   Step 1 -- Create A New Blog   First, go to Blogger.com and click the Start Now button. If you're already a Blogger.com member, just sign in and click the "create a new blog" link. The idea here is to set up a new blog in your own name first. Go through the four steps of setting up a new blog. Keep in mind that the title, description and other settings will eventually be changed by the giftee.   See:  urlLink How do I create a Blogger account?  See:  urlLink How do I create a blog that Blogger will host for free?    Step 2 -- Write An Initial Post   Once you've set up the blog, write a first post the same way you would sign a card. Something along the lines of, "I love you." (Not recommended if you're giving this gift to your boss.) Bonus tip: Put a link to your own blog in the template.  See:  urlLink How do I edit my link list?    Step 3 -- Add Team Member   This is the actual gift-giving moment. Go to Settings > Members > Add Team Member and enter the email of your intended recipient. In the field marked "Message (Optional)" enter a few comments to holiday-up the email invitation you are about to send. Something along the lines of "Yo! I have taken great technical pains to set you up with a brand-new Blog. If it's not the right size, let me know. Happy Festivus!" Then click "Send Invite."  Now, an email inviting someone to join a blog does not really have that happy-gifty feel. Don't worry; we've got you covered. Here's a bonus round of optional offline techniques for turning the gift blog into an all-star physical gifting experience.   Step 4 -- The Blogger Gift-Card Booklet   The whole setting up of the blog thing takes place in the ether of cyberspace but you can't show up empty handed. We asked Livia McRee, author of  urlLink Quick Crafts: 30 Fast and Fun Projects , what she would do at the eleventh hour to turn this virtual gift into an actual gift. She came up with something fun and unique in record time: the Blogger Gift-Card Booklet. The following is optional, but if you have a printer and some glue, you are so money right now. You're money and you don't even know it.   Supplies: Here's What You Need  • Blank card or card stock (heavy paper) • Envelope • Printouts of Blogger logo and tutorials: - Print:  urlLink Blogger Logo  - Print:  urlLink What is a blog?  - Print:  urlLink How do I change the name of my blog or its description?  • Optional: Decorative paper scraps • Craft knife or other utility knife • Ruler or straight edge of some sort • Glue stick or other glue  Note: Livia made a neat little window that opens like one of those holiday calendars with the chocolates in them to reveal the Blogger logo, if you don't want to deal with too much cutting and trimming, skip the window and glue the logo right on top of the card.   Assembly: Here's What You Do   Fold your card - Find the middle point of your card stock on both longer edges, then use the ruler and knife to gently score a line between them. Fold along the line.  Trim to fit - Use your envelope to mark where the card needs to be trimmed so it will fit, then cut off the excess.  Sketch the window - Find the middle point along each edge of the card, then lightly connect them using a ruler and pencil. The point at which they cross will be the middle; sketch a square (the size of your logo) centered over it.  Make the window - Cut along the top and bottom of the window square, and gently score the sides. Cut down the middle to make the flaps that open. Erase all the pencil marks.  Powered by Blogger - Glue a Blogger logo to the inside of the window.  Frame it - Stick a frame of decorative paper around the window, if desired. Or draw one with a marker.  Make the booklet - First print out the tutorial pages to fit within your card (reduce and trim if needed). Stack them together in order and staple along the left hand edge. Then glue the back page into the card (glue stick works best). Cover the staples with a piece of decorative paper.  So there you go. Blogger Knowledge has saved you from looking like a thoughtless schmuck this holiday season. There's no need to thank us, it's what we do. Now you will be able to link to your new blogger friend when you're blogging about them. You will also be able to eavesdrop on their life a lot easier. Ah, the gift of blog, what a joyous thing it is.

      Monday.  Not a lot happened today really, the day started off early for me, woke up 0530, it had rained heavily all night.   It took a long time to clear, but eventually the sun broke through, and brought the environs back o light again.  When it’s grey here everything seems grey and fed up , but when the sun arrives , everything happens , it’s like the difference from an old silent B & W movie and the latest Technicolor , THX surround sound epic, it really is that different.  At the moment , I have got time to sit on the deck and reflect , The Tanner’s have headed out into the distance to go to Tauranga to go shopping , in Briggsy’s Jeep.  They would have normally taking Mistrel, but we are still waiting on the right front brake tube coming into town after it went the other day whilst I was driving.  Scarey.  Briggsy is resting by the pool zapping in the ray’s , having some adult quiet time , and today , I will let her have quiet on her own by the pool.  She works’ exceptionally long days, up at 0530 hr’s returning home around 1830 hrs.  12 hour’s work may seem average to some city types , who have sedentary work styles , her’s and the rest of  ‘ The Stud worker’s ‘ , have a 12 hour physical workout daily , so much so that  she now sport’s a highly toned physique ,  bulging bicep’s the work’s .  She bear’s no resemblance to Fatima Whitbread though.  Sitting here kicking back with my incense stick’s and Café del Mar tunes playing ambient chill in the background.  Colourful birdsong and the sound of the neighbour’s up the hill, using a mower.  Whilst some may like the ‘Banging tunes ‘vacation, this is my idea of a vacation far from the maddening crowd.  Sheer perfection.  At this moment in time I could not wish to be any where else.  No ‘Girl’s ‘wailing and shrieking, adult chill time.  I don’t know how, or wish to learn how parents do it.  You must be incredibly tolerant, or deaf and blind.  Eric & Michelle must have a degree in it.  I turned my hand in today in the kitchen , quite literally whilst preparing meal’s ready for the ‘Chrimbo’ period. After a shopping trip this afternoon in Cambridge, quite a pretty little town just 30 minutes up the road.  I had decided I would cook up some old faves of mine, one’s that I used on the last time over here with Mirre & Eudes.  Piedmont Style oven roasted peppers , similar too but not like that evil woman DS’ version , who no doubt will be dictating to the Brit public, where they have been going wrong over all the years in the kitchen department.  Oven roasted squash Soap & Oven Roasted Mixed Onion Marmalade.  Whilst prepping the squash ,  I quite by accident and subconsciously thought that it needed some flesh in it and sliced clean into my left index finger.  Claret all over the place, luckily Michelle as a Nurse, and ITU Sister at that, she quickly cleaned and sutured me up, I had three stitches (I did not get a lolly for being brave thogh ….. Not fair. No such thing as a ‘Lucky Bleeder ‘especially if you is a haemophiliac)  All sorted now though, all though I reopened it all up when I went down to play with thepig’s a little earlier.  Briggsy has just popped around the corner to enquire as to   ‘What R U eating? ‘  Der I am typing.  She is dving into Home made Lemon curd sandwiches.  ‘Purely for quality control purposes’  Just how much Lemon Curd can one test, I am sure she must have made up a decision by now, she is almost into the second jar in as many day’s.  Wait till she reads this, and I get a slap.  Oh well, live dangerously.  Any way she has demolished the sarnie and has now joined me on the deck, chatting.  It seem’s somewhat strange but we are both writing Blog’s in the same house , about the same period of time , and we both eagerly log on to see what , the other’s take has been on the day , and look forward to see what the Blog! Teams take on it is.  ‘Mummie’ ( Cx’s Mum ) is back home now and eating up emails and blog again.  So that’s good news.  Hm , the sun is waning now and it look’s like it is going to be yet another glorious sunset , far better than Ibiza , and I get to enjoy it loads more.  I have missed a few day’s so far on Blog! But I will back date some entries so they appear in the correct place.   Still getting loads of Spam and very few emails.  You miss me that much already.  If Mia and I decide to move her , which is highly probable if everything get’s sorted out soon , I do hope that that you will still keep in contact , all too soon we forget our chum’s.  Love you all.  Miss you all.  Kisses for all the ladies.  Big Manlike Hairey Chest Hug’s for all the fella’s.  For all of you that read Q4A , I do not mince contrary to what Cx has stated.  But I do have two wonderful red light sabres that all of Matamata are jealous of.  Laters  No piccies were taken today.  At this time you will just be waking up in the UK, so have a good one  Hitman , Darwin & Ange here’s a a big ‘ Mwaahhh ‘ just because.  Darwin update you Blog!  In the word’s of another Blogger not a million miles away.  ‘ Tell them how you Feeeeeel ! ‘  I will get this posted up ,and start back on Sunday’s and the previous day’;s event’s.

      Well , that entry came and went , I am sorry I have been slack and not updated.  I am no Briggsy , and I have not got the gift of scribing in the way that she does.  Hmm , so what happened next day.  Well I awoke bight and breezy , no problem’s with jet lag , whatsoever.  Cx went off to work as normal at ‘ O My God O’clock ‘. I was left at ‘ Cedar Lodge ‘ for the day.  I pottered around the farm and Harriette took me on the guided tour of the farm , to view what was new and what had changed.  Since my last trip , ‘ The Tanners ‘ have increased their livestock somewhat . The lamb’s have all shed their load. The cattle herd has grown up , even the calf called ‘ Carol ‘ , with the arrival of Summer has gotten  all horny and the the little 2 inch stump’s that rise from her head now make it easier to differentiate her from the rest of the youngsters. Freckles is as docile and funny as ever , she also now sport’s horn’s and whilst he loves a good rub and scratch behind the ears , when she bows her head down to lick you to death , one has to watch where she is swinging her head in case she has one away and I become a ‘ Womble ‘.  No # 47 is noticeably absent. ?????? No she is not she’s in the freezer.  The Tanner’s now have pig’s, who are the most comical pig’s I have ever seen .  The theory of not naming your livestock, ‘ Nice names ‘ , so it make’s them easier to ‘ Slot ‘ and eat a later date , seem’s to have been lost on ‘ The Girl’s ‘.  They have named them all ‘ Lovely Nice Names ‘ ,  Arwen , a big black  sow , who is by far the dominant female out of the five but easily the most affectionate , and loves having her shoulder blades scratched and rubbed and positively goes weak at the kneee’s ( Do Pig’s Have Knee’s ?  Must ask Eric later ) and flop’s to the floor when content after a good scratch.   Smeagol the  only one ‘ Boy ‘ amongst the five , and is quite substantially smaller than , a little black fella’ , who whilst small looks grown up with all his nasal piercing’s  , a very timid character , who only today allowed a ‘ Who- Man bean ‘ to give him a scratch behind the ear’s . He seem’s quite at ease with Harriette doing the honours , but is scared of ‘ Fat Boy Mad ‘ and run’s away at a rate of knot’s when I try , but he is brave enough to pop up close to have a nose around when I am with the other’s. he is completely dominated by  ‘ Arwen ‘ and coming feeding time he is well down the pecking order.  ‘ Squealer aka Gollum  ‘ also get’s jealous when ‘ Arwen ‘ get’s all the attention is brave enough to pop up for a scratch , and makes me chuckle and get’s practically inside your skin for a rub down , but if one of the other’s spies her , she makes a really pathetic little whiney squeal as if to say ‘ Help me Purlease help me ‘ , the rest of  ‘ the Mob ‘ pitch up fronted out by ‘ Arwen ‘ , who dives staright back in for another rub down.  #4 ( Harriette inform’s she is Bingo Baggins ) as I can never remember her name is a sort of ‘ Ging – wahhh ‘ , full of attitude and is very aloof and only want’s to know you if you have grub , very nosey when the other’s all bound across the paddock , but has none of the touching stuff from the ‘ Who-Man Bean ‘.  One of the sow’s remains, distant and aloof and watches from a distance , a sort of reddy colour , with  a large white saddle , I have yet to have contact with this one.  I know Briggsy , came to Zeeeland on her ‘ Quest 4 Aragorn ‘ , but I hardly think she was referring to the pig in the paddock Cedar Lodge , that ‘ The Girl’s ‘ so kindly named so.  I am dreading the day Eric call’s/ E mail’s us with the news that ‘ Aragorn has finally met his match and has benn vanquished slotted and frozen down for munchies ‘  Briggsy will devastated.  I popped into town a little later , Hinuera , where ‘ Cedar Lodge ‘ is some 10 Km’s from Matamata , I walked it once , last time foolishly and cycled it. Took  the wrong turn and it took me 3 hour’s to get home , in a car this takes no time.  I popped in to get a pay as you go Sim card  , for my mobile that my old work colleagues had purchased for me , so that I could stay in contact in Zeeland , $35 for the Sim ( It comes with $10 Credit on it so quite cheap – I am working on that there is approx $3 to a £1 – in fact it’s slightly less ) and I purchased a $50 top up card .  Chuffed I thought, Sweet I thought , Easy as that I thought.  Oh how presumptuous of me , ‘ Whack Whack oooooop’s ‘ .   Phone blocked , 999 calls only.  Damn and blast , I popped back into the shop to try and see why.  The staff told me my phone had to be on a roaming network, perhap’s the V/Phone shop over the road could sort it.  Thing’s were looking up again, so a quick hop and skip over the road to the V/Phone. .  ‘How RRRRRRRR yah? ‘   It’s the Kiwi equivalent of  , Good Morning/Good Afternoon/Good Evening , how are you today, are you well , are you tip top Johnny banana , I think you get the gist. The difference from the UK is that they ACTUALLY mean it.  I explained my situation and the girl in the shop, phoned up V/Phone NZ. ‘ Ooooohhh Oii see ‘  She muttered to the anon voice at the end.  ‘Thus Big fellar , in’t gonna be hippy , whin Oii tell hum thit ‘  Phone down.  ‘We Kint do utt from higher , yeh gonna hiv tahh phurne the UK , tah git thim to sort it out from their side ‘  She gave me the number to sort it out , an I thought I will wait fro it to get later , so when the UK wakes up I can do it from ‘ Cedar Lodge ‘  I popped into the Kodak shop, that ad restored my faith in camera franchises, after the Nelson one lost all 900 of my piccies from last time I was here in FEB/APR.  I was greeted by a familiar face, Justine.  ‘ Hiya , how are you I’m back in town . I need to have a word with you ‘  ‘How RRRRR yah ? ‘  She look somewhat perplexed, as to why I neede to have a speak with her after only being in town a day already.  Those other Blogger’s that I know , will remember that I was so chuffed with the staff in this shop , I had recommended them to Briggsy , when she rolled into to town , and due to the type of memory card she has on her camera , they had been unable to sort out her piccie. She had not been chuffed, and has been going to Hamilton (1 hour’s drive from here) to a shop that could process her card.  Justine quickly pointed out a new bit of kit in the corner and stated that they had been waiting for the right bit of equipment to come into the shop to sort it , but now she ushered me towards a yellow/blue ATM size machine that resembled some Fisher Price toy from yester year that stood just inside the doorway.  This bit of kit now processes all types of card , you slip the memory card into the corresponding slot and do all the downloading , printing , burning yourself if you so wish , using a touch screen interface.  Very user friendly.  I gave it a whirl, assisted by her, and was suitably impressed.  She was chuffed that she was now able to help Briggsy out. Briggsy was also chuffed when I told her later; she no longer has to endure a 2 hour drive to get her piccies sorted.  I bade my farewells’ and mooched around the town a little more Michelle had to sort some stuff out so I popped in RD1, a shop that caters mainly for the rural district’s, you can all sort’s in her from Pig Food , Cappuccino machines , Farm equipment and also a sort of Farmer’s Top Shop / Burton’s , ‘ Practical yet colourful , this season’s farmer’s will be wearing … ‘  As all of you know I am slave to fashion, and I dived into see what bargains, I could spy, I was completely oblivious to the fact that Michelle was at the counter.  I spotted another friendly face behind the counter from the last time I was here, earlier in the year.  ‘ uhuh so yerrr bick in tarn ‘  I cannot remember her name at this time , but she is still convinced I am Eric’ bro , so wanting to shatter her thougt’s I smiled nicely and gave her the standard version of Stan’s kisses.  Apparently later on Eric happened to pop in the shop and she had spoken to Eric.  ‘I see yer bro’s bick , he give me a kuss ind practically dragged me over the bloody counter ‘  Kiwis’ love ‘em.  How Eric must have been chuffed ….hahahahahaha.   AND BREATHE   Retired back to the house, Briggsy had been on the phone to Michelle, desperately trying to ascertain if I wanted to go see, LOTR 3 (The Return of the King) that evening with me.  She had been soooo looking forward to see this movie, for several reasons.  The previous 2 movies, coupled with my ranting and raving over how she would love NZ, were very instrumental in here taking the year off and coming to work with Neddies in NZ.  So much so that she named her Blog! After ‘HIM ‘and she has been looking for ‘Him ‘ever since.  Bless, both her mum and I have been desparately trying to convince her that he is a work of fiction and that he is actually a Dane who lives in the states, she is having none of it.  When she finally realises it will be like when we all found out that that Father Christmas and all the reindeer’s , were actually your parent’s , who had been having you over all that time.  Thank god, I found out before I went to boarding school, how embarrassing would that have been.  I can just see the ‘Friend’s Reunited ‘Website.   Paul Stephenson , wasn’t he that prat , that believed in Father Christmas that used to beg Matron not to remove his sock’s from of his bed end in the belief that some mystical paedophile in red and white would turn and empty his sack for him ‘   Or   ‘We had The Clash and all thing’s punk, Stan well he had heroes as well Father Christmas ‘  Oh well Mummie at least we tried.  I have just realised, that I can even manage to go off on tangent whilst writing a bloody blog!  Any way home made pizza's coming out of the oven , more later

      Well, I think I have managed to get over the nightmare that is long haul flights and after 2 night's of sleep I feel surprisingly well.  In full Monday/Tuesday was a very long 24 hour period.  Sunday night had been a very pleasant day as a whole.  Little Darwin/Marlon had popped in to see in the Afternoon , to drop off my kit bags from work and drop in the various pressies for Cx in the form of loads of music.  7 tapes of uplifting trance from Darwin and some alternative stuff from Hitman.  Turbo drove up from Southampton just to drop in an ickle pressie and wished me a safe journey and headed off to Essex to attend his shot's course.  These have been received very well, more about that a little bit later.  Mia & I packed and ironed everything from top to bottom and had managed to get it all in my large ' Stewardess ' case , you know the ones I mean.   The one's the trolley dollies use on flights, except mine was a ' Mansize ' version.  As it Christmas as you are all probably aware everyone that knows the Tanners & Cx wanted to send over something to say high and they were all included but Mia had no intention of letting anything spoil her ironing.   So I had to bring the old faithful rucksack as well.  After all the ' Work ' had been done and after I had checked everything for the umpteenth time , we both decided to retire to the local.  Where we chatted to our chums and raised a glass for Chrimbo & New Year.  After a couple of very long days/nights out , we retired early knowing that I had to be off early with all news of Saddam's arrest , I had this sneaking suspicion that everything would be thrown into case @ Heathrow and decided to leave earlier than the suggested 3 hours before the flight took off.  I had a cappuccino @ a chum's.  Thinking excitedly that this time in a couple of day's I would be in Zealand for real.  I took the Heathrow express and bumped into one of Turbo's chum's I had met in the summer  , he was heading out to Malta for 5 day's for work.  Tough life these people have.  I had meant to be starting @ my new job on Monday @ NSY , not a job  I was even remotely interested at this moment in time.  But hey that's another story , I had booked my annual and I was heading out.  Did I care? did I hell.  A speedy journey to Terminal three , book in straight to the front of the queue and booked I was well under the 32 KG's per bag , in total I had 19 kg's.  I always wonder why people take so much with them when they travel.  Even in a worse case scenario , if everything get's lost ,it's not as though people on the other side of the world  , don't have suitable shop's with which to replenish stuff that has either been forgotten or lost en route.  I had actually forgotten some stuff that Mia is probably cussing me for , it was the girl's choccies that she had been saving especially for  them , for their stocking.  KW had promised he would make sure that I would not be taking the flight if he had anything to do with it.  But what happened next , even took me by surprise.  1000's of people pass though Heathrow and work there and suddenly out of the blue popped and old chum who was at training school with me , a chap called Keith Norgate whose wife Julia had served with me @ Kingston and was on  ' The squad ' with me.  He had  popped over from Terminal 2 for a shopping trip , as the best shop's are in Terminal  3 apparently.  Hard life being a port's officer.  I  passed through depature's and  had a mooch around then walked into the Smoker's lounge when yet another old face met me.  He was working but it stopped almost straight away.and we chatted the name of the person in question , none other than Lyndsey W.  Spooky or what.  ' I heard you were in , and thought I would look you up '  His colleague left him and returned and LW and I chatted , about the obvious.  Suddenly I became very conscious as the people surrounding LW and I looked up.  ' Bloody Hell '  Armed police had walked up beside me and everyone was clocking me as if to say.  ' Whose that bloke with the shaved head and body piercings  , should we know him ? ' I made eye contact and yet another old face greeted me from Kingston.  Dave Ramage , for those of you that can remember him.  The surrounding audience were even more perplexed when rather than being dragged away screaming and cuffed , we  all started laughing  and shaking hand's.  Dve went about his normal duties and chatted som more with Lw , he ahd to return to work but we agrred to meet for lunch before I boarded and he would see me to the plane.  Nice.  Phoned Hadders , Hx & Ange for the last time for a while and partook in the obligatory G & T.       Had lunch courtesy of Lyndsey and spotted a bottle of whisky valued at £22000 squid  ,watched people making hand made cigars.  Bing Bong ! Bing Bong !  I had been summoned for the flight on time and LW walked me to the gate.       Piccies taken , messages received and they have been subsequently passed on.  Took my seat , with some trepidation , I was worried about what would happen next , who else would pop up.  ' Would KW pop up and have me removed  ? '  ' Would someone on the plane suddenly burst into song ? '  ' Now the world don't move to the sound of just one drum ....... '  It's and in joke but those of you that know would get the funny side of it.  Door's closed ,  a quick rev of the engine and I was off to Zealand,  Hoozah.  Unlike the last time when, I did not have a clue what to expect , this time I knew what to expect.  Last time I had left Cx behind , this time I was going to reunited with her.  Not forgetting the wonderful resident' of ' Cedar Lodge ' who have so looked after her since she ' popped in ' to chill out after ' The Marfell Down's ' experience.  Not just for myself , but for all her chum's.  Ange , Trude , Di , The Hersham Mafia , Stuart D , Weenie , Hadders , JFP , Golden Ball's , Hitman , Jeffwee Herrett , ah oooolaa , barley Marley ,  Taff , The VK Blog team , The Quest 4 Aragorn Massive worldwide , The DYRMS Forum member's, STRE , Rowena , so many people who had gotten to know her over the last 9 month's but @ this time and most importantly for ' Mummy '.   Am I rambling tough , I will get the biggy entry in now 'cos I don't know how much I will be writing in future , it certainly will not be a on a par with Q4A.  I won't bore you with the tedious factor's of the flight , safe to say , I became fly paper for freak's I will fill you in later.  LAX airport was as horrible experience as ever , I could not even pop out to meet Bloo & Mx , who had hoped to meet up with me briefly.  Sorry Guy's.  The Septic's were as usless as ever , rude obnoxious unhelpful as ever , just reaffirming to me why , I have no desire to ever venture into their world.  I got pulled by customs and they asked when I had last been in their country and told that it was earlier in the year at that it had not been by choice , I just happoend to have been forced to experience LAX and that If I'd had a choice I would avoid their country like the plague .  Septic's don't get irony do they.  I was met with stoney silence and my passport chucked back at me.  I got away lightly the guy behind , was absolutely sozzled and had been a pain in the rear all the way thoughout the flight.  Loud , Leary , Lewd , Rude & Crude , but oh dear he was in Septic Land where the the right to bear arm's is a constitutional right , and it's amazing that once he had the gun shoved in his face and he had been cuffed and chucked to the ground , you could almost smell his fear.  He sobered up quick his trouser's changed colour , he never continued the journey.  Allelujah , if they had not done it I am sure he would have lynched by the rest of the passengers.  Great movie selection on the way over.  '' Matchstick Men ' ' Nemo ' The best one by far , must get it on DVD ' '˜ The league of Extraordinary gentleman .. average ' ' SeaBiscuit ...... Yawwwwwwwnnn ' ' The legend of Jonny Lingo .... obligatory Kiwi Movie .... Good ' ' The Hulk .... hmmmmmm  - the jury is out '  Ariving inzealand I was greeted by Eric , Harri & Alice , big beaming smiles and the sun was shining , sorry guy's , not rubbing it in much .  KW had not succeeded and I had gotten there  The kid's bounding around lasted approximately 20 ins , then they flatlined in the car, they were knackered and had gotten up at 0300 hrs to meet ' Uncle Stan ' I felts surprisingly well considering I had been awake from 0800 hrs Monday UK time and it was now Wednesday 0530 hrs Kiwi Time ( Tuesday 1630 hrs UK Time ).  Driving along the road , it all came back to me , It was though I had never been away , the green rolling hill's , the mighty Waikato River to my offside , IT was as beautiful as ever.  A couple of hour's drive later , it flew past and seemed a lot shorted than that , but I was jetlagged after all , the journey had flown as I filled in Eric with all the gossip and news from Home , and we laughed as heartily as ever.  Dukie humour , nay  Eric's humour is as unique as ever.  Pulling into the drive I was greeted with two big waggie tails and squeals and whines from the Dog's Inca & Ben ( pronounced in Kiwi as BIN )  Michelle had just enough time for a kiss and Big squeeze and then she was out of the door to work as was Eric and I was left to baby-sit.  Shorts on T Shirt off , I  took my place at the poll and just chilled as I bay sat the Girl's.       Sheer Bliss.       Was I worried that you guy's would be working in the rain was I hell.       The Afternoon passed very quickly the burn time is 15 minutes at the moment and although I was wearing Factor 60 ( yep it does exist , but you would never get Brit's to wear it )  I was losing my anaemic look and taking on a pleasant glow of health.  M & E had returned from work and we retired for afternoon tea and muffins on the pool side.  Eric then remarked ' Kroll will be home soon , I suppose we will have to expect and emotional reunion '  Gulp !!!!!  After my wibbling on Friday , which she managed to avoid , I was conscious of the fact that I would be seeing my chum for the first time in ages.  I paced up and down the drive ( it's not short by any means ) , brushed my teeth , I had a shave and spruced up myself ( A little at least ).  I even considered sitting on the gate to greet her.  Nope I decided I would sit by the pool and await her arrival.  ' Stin , Stin , Kroll's home '  I had sooo many things to tell her , would I 'member them , all.  Then suddenly like it was just yesterday , I treated to a big smiley happy face , in shorts , covered in horse poo and the biggest hug ever , I only became conscious of the fact I had lifted her off her feet , when she politely enquired.  ' Could you put me down now '    I think you get the picture , Yoda will know what it's like.  Pressies  , hug's squeezes and massages card's etc were given and received from all parties concerned and she smiled from ear to ear when , I gave her the largest T Shirt I had ordered from the USA earlier in the year to cheer her up from all her chums.            It was signed by em all and she was made up as you can see.  We then spent the rest of the afternoon chatting sprawled across the poolside , and for the first time ever , Kroll did not ask me to stop speaking for a moment , soooo many things had happened since she had left the UK , she is almost up to speed now , but now she is telling me to stop speaking and breathe some times at least.       It's a mega opening blog ! and it''s now Friday and she is off tomorrow and we is going shopping.  I have already uploaded photos that you will get later on today when I finish the rest of this entry.  Hitman , When you see Agnes M8 , how far could you be from your impression ,all I will say is Hubba Hubba.  I did as a way of saying fank you for doing the Blog! For me.  Stan

Harry & Alice & Eric came to meet me at the airport big hug's all around.  They had to get up at 0300 to be there , talk about puuting themselves out.  I love this family.  One lovely drive home through this beautiful country and it seems I have never left.   The rolling greens of the waikato still leave me breathless , it's almost like a second home.

      Well It's sunday and I have had my first lie in until 0930 hrs for the first time since.  30Th December.  My Blog has been somewhat absent due to the fact that I had buggered up the template.  At present my archives atr e all up the creak so dion't try looking for them.  sorry I wuill sort it later.  This week has been one of the most mental and physical weeks I have had ever , fact.  I popped up to pahia to see my old chum Rabbit aka Clair amongst others.   urlLink Pahia Dive Centre   On Sunday last week she popped in at 00030hrs to say .  ' Hold on to your horses , you are starting a dive course @ 0830 hrs tomorrow , see you there .  She has been desparate to get me ' Wet ' and in the water for ages.  I am still tired when I write this now.  I had to complete an Open Water course first over 4 days , lots of study , and lots of physical exams long before I got in the water , the  wildlife here is astonishing a veritable underwater garden .  I was instructed by a very lovely young chap  called Ty- Ray , a 19 year chap.  Not like those 19 years , I deal with in the UK.  A truly gifted chap.  I had 2 others on my course Julian & Julie , from Cambridge & Jersey respectively.  Sorry rubbing my eyes , post course party wearing off.  All 3 of us completed the OW Course , Julian sailed off into the sunset on an eco cruise on Friday am.  Julia then went headlong into the Advanced course for two days.  In order to complete an Advanced one has to complete several compulsory dives and disciplines.  I chose   Deep Dive  - 28 metres - seriously dark and gloomy down there. Wreck Dive - I dived the Rainbow Warrior yesterday , I have become known as Grrrr the Steam Engine up her , due to the rate I eat 200 Bar of air.  For those of you  that know aboout this PADI stuff , I was sucking aluminium casing at 26 metres , in a scenario of ' Out of Air ' at 26 metres on ' The Warrior '  , quite quite humbling , but my training paid off and I am here now ...... Phewww , it was  touch and go.  Navigation  Peak Performance Buoyancy  Underwater Photography - I have yet to pick up my film laters.  ON completing the course we had a team , debrief until 0300 hrs , for those that were not diving today , I am having a  day off , I am really knackered , but I am hopefully back out all week.  Back to the Warrior.  Too much to tell you all about , love you loads.   Julia heads out today to Orcland to meet up with chums , 2 days late , she had been undecided whether to do the course  but she is glad now.  I will miss her tomorrow as the buddy that  saved me from the depths , life changing moments do that to you.  Mia is cool in UK , missing me , and Iwill update  her with all this  news later.  TTFN  Matamata missing you , I will probably get back after this weekend after yet another course.  It's several friend's Birthday's up here , including mine and Rabbit's so we have a big party to organise , yummyy , fresh sea food from the DIVE School students's & Teachers.

      It's bloody hot today.  HEAD SHAVE TIME.  I now resemble a red potato.  Nice.  I am in  urlLink Northland  at present  In floral shirt and careless abandon I head out into the sun yet again       Last night was lovely , kicked back and enjoyed the sunset.   urlLink       Feeling no pain or pang's of guilt for you lot over in the UK.  Holiday season is not normal everything shut's and there is very little to do ' cept  bathe in the glorious rays.  Hope you are all well.  Sitting in an internet cafe much like stivs did probably.  All the terminals are with Kanji writing on them , lucky the O/S is familiar to me otherwise I woud be lost.  I have just found out that he is in the UK .  Why ?  Did he return so early , some nice emails from some of the bods.  Mx is looking forward to popping over, and catching up with Briggsy & ' The Tanner's '  Roger - Got your message cheers.  Hadder's - I will update Maam when I finish walkabout dunno when that will  be.  Bloo - Be Lucky.  I notice that forum is very lacking of recent.  Why??   Oh well it's 1500 hrs and it's a scorcher.  I cannot think of anything to write really , I just thought I had better other wise ' Hitman ' would be cussing there is nothing in his in box at work.  Sorry guy's.  hope night's was not too stressy and you are all safe.  St@n

              " Happy New Year From NZ  "     Well it was a very long day yesterday.  I survived it however and the weather is absolutely glorious today.  I had a jolly and lay back and took it easy on the beach , and took in the rays.  Maybe a tad too much as there is a slightly pinky red hue covering the body , but I harped back to day's  of dukiedom , when post exams in the senior school , we took to covering ourselves in lashings of Hawaiian Tropic sun tan cream.  The heavy cocunut scent when one slathers it all over , always reminds me of that period of my life.  Even though I am the otherside of the globe from all of you.  I am thinking of you as I write this brief entry.  I am sorry I have been somewhat slack since I have been here , but I thought it rather silly to duplicate Briggsy style stuff when she  writes so wonderfully.  Today is a very chilled day , either because those that were out late last night until the early hour's are sleeping off the effects of over indulgence or just maybe it's because everyone has a day off and have ' Gone Away ' for their holidays , to Coromandel , The Bay of Islands  or Tauranga.  The day was not lost on me , I love sitting and contemplating over here in the sun , waves and ambient holiday sounds all around me.  Wherever you are at this moment in time , I hope you have a safe and peaceful new  year with your Kith & Kin.  Hx thank's for looking after Mia whilst I am away , I hope you had a nice evening in ' Larfin & Joking '  Hitman , Be Lucky.  ' Marlon ' I hope all is well with you , I notice a lack of entries on ' Rabbit ' , I hope that does not mean ' Bad Fings '  Hadders – email received . Message not yet passed , but I will see what we can do about mailing you piccies , love and hugs to Frances.  KW – Just to rub it in I supped a glass of red wine for you and Alison as the sun fell across the bay for the last time in 2003.  Here's to all of you.

        Forget About Tomorrow      Calling, distorting Reach the ends for you Burn a hole right through  Talking, we keep talking Filling empty space In this lonley frame As the image fades in to one  (Chorus)  Today it all feels fine A sense of freedom fills your mind Can't think about tomorrow Just breathe the air inside And bring on back that lonely smile Can't think about tomorrow...  Twisting, constricted On the edge for you You know i'd jump right through  Falling, we keep stalling I can see the ground Someplace new to land As the image fades into one  Today it all feels fine A sense of freedom fills your mind Can't think about tomorrow Just breathe the air inside And bring on back that lonely smile Can't think about tomorrow  Can't think about tomorrow...   Because you, feel yourself Fall apart again You hold your face inside your aching hands The angels tears come flooding down again Bring us back again  Yearning, returning To this empty street As the city sleeps  Tearing, dispairing As the day comes in As the morning sings As the image fades into one  (Chorus)  Today it all feels fine A sense of freedom fills your mind Can't think about tomorrow Just breathe the air inside And bring on back that lonely smile Can't think about tomorrow  Today it all feels fine A sense of freedom fills your mind Can't think about tomorrow (x 2)     For Jun Ya

      My matey Rabbit has made the news  for all the right reasons   Rainbow Warrior graffiti artist gets the hard word    01.06.2004   Scooby's bid for aquatic immortality has met with stern disapproval from dive companies which take people to visit the wreck of the Rainbow Warrior.    The former Greenpeace vessel was bombed by French secret service agents in Auckland in 1985, killing one on board. The ship was refloated and towed to Matauri Bay in Northland, where it now sits 25m under water.   The wreck sat there largely undisturbed for 18 years until recently, when someone scraped the limpets and crustaceans off its bow and used a knife to carve 'SCOOBY 2004' in letters 15cm high on it.   'Scooby' lived near the wreck site, and had been told his actions were unwelcome, said Mike Edkins of Dive North Rainbow Warrior.   "We know who he is. Paihia Dive and we are were just really brassed off that someone was doing this for no good reason"  'The last thing we want to see on there while we're taking tourists on there, because we do guided dives on there, is some idiot writing his name on there just because he thinks he has a right to.'   Rep's from both Dive North & Paihia Dive had ' " had words with him all right ", Edkins added  Local dive companies were annoyed that people sometimes took crayfish because the site was also sacred to Maori. "  Clare O'Gorman ( Rabbit ) of Paihia Dive said the wreck was treated with a great deal of respect.  " To Graffiti the wreck is noytonly a desceration of one of our most famous artificial reserves, it also encourages irresponsible diver behaviour "  Unfortunately . ther is no law stipulating that the Warrior is an artificial reserve and should be left untouched, it is just a ' gentlemans agreement 'that keep's the wreck protected.  Well said Rabbit.
