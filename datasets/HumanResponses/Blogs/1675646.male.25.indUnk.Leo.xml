      My final night in this apartment.  This is the first place outside of my parents house of course where I actually made it to the one year mark.  I must say I am feeling oddly emotional about the whole thing.  I have never been one to revel in the idea of hard physical labour either.  I hate moving.  In fact I already hurt my back because stupid me, yet again(I've done this everytime I moved), put almost all my cd's in one box(which is 200 something) then tried to lift really fast.  So that didn't work out so well, and now my back hurts.  Well what can you say besides I am an idiot.  And before anyone gets all excited: If you ever come visit me remember that I have rather eclectic taste in music and my collection if you can call it that deserves to be made fun of.  Although don't make fun of it to my face or I will hurt you.  My apologies but moving makes me violent.  Just be happy that I am moving into my own place away from my roommates and their swords and fighting sticks.  I do however have a baseball bat, tennis racket, and a Darth Maul double edged lightsabre.  Why yes I am a big geek, thank you for noticing.  I also found out today that my new computer has arrived...hooray...although my hookups for phone, net, and cable aren't until Aug. 7.  But I will do my best to get to the internet where I can, most likely at the home of my loving parents.  My eldest sister went to the "I love SARS" concert.  At least that's what she called it...because of course if it weren't for SARS the event never would have happened.  Hence the I love SARS.  But I digress.  I'm hardly jealous, I mean if I wanted to see a bunch of old men try to be young I'd....well I'd something anyway.  It was like the geriatric empowerment sessions or something.  ACDC???  The Rolling Stones??  The Guess Who??  Blue Rodeo??  Sass Jordan??  Who let these people out of the home??  Really they should be sitting in a chair eating honey mush, not playing music for the Gen X croud.    As you can tell I am going to miss my internet for the next little while so I am ranting on majorly to make up for it.  But all good things must come to an end, and I must rest up for my move, and final cleaning.  Well there will always be the memories, oh yes, I'll always have those.

      Ewwwww oven cleaning.  Okay I don't actually gross out that easily, nevertheless the oven is not pleasant.  Sigh, still waiting to know when I can move in to my new place and getting impatient with it.  My roommates can start moving into there place tomorrow, and I naturally am helping with that.  The irony there is that it's likely that when it comes time to help me they won't be able to help me.  It's just the way things will probably work out, I don't hold it against them it's just annoying.  And I once again must remind people, that if you don't hear from me for a little bit I am alive and doing fine (I hope), just without phone or internet for a while.  What a vapid entry!    I shall make it my goal after the move to actually make some interesting entries...maybe even thought provoking.  Maybe...you never know...anything is possible...

      I should have packed today but I didn't.  Oh well, I'm sure I'll get it done.  I'm still waiting to hear from my new landlords about movie in time.  Here's hoping I can move in the same day I leave here, the 31st I hope.    I ordered my new computer (as the one I have written all this on isn't mine), which will hopefully arrive Aug. 2nd.  And since I am not entirely clear on what my new address is it's being shipped to my parents house.  Which is only 5 minutes drive away from me anyway.  But without knowing the address I can't get an appointment with eastlink to set up my phone cable and internet.  And even if I made an appointment I can't be sure when the computer is coming.  Shipping is supposed to be two weeks, and I placed the order Tuesday.  I am looking forward to my move, or at least the move being over with.  It's way too hot in this apartment and it's interfering with not only my comfort level, but my sleeping pattern as well.  I could probably be sleeping right now, but instead I'm writing here.  So I guess if there's anyone who may need to call me next weekend it's unlikely I'll be availabe...I can still check my email at a couple different places.  I'll likely hang at my parents, as I need to sort through alot of my old stuff that's still sitting in their house.  Let's see...today is July 27 (my time it is anyway)...I turn 24 in 2 weeks.  Time to put myself out to pasture, because I'm an old mule.

      Oops not writing enough.  Over the course of the past few days I have come up with many great things to write about.  But now, as the time comes to write, I've got nothing.  This is like writing an exam or something.    If I were to test the people who know me, I would bet the results wouldn't be very good.  Although I'm also willing to bet that I would fail a test on myself as well.  What is this drivel I spewing?  Apparently I'm in moos to be cyclical.  That's no fun.    So allow me to pose a philosophical question.  If I am my own worst enemy.  How do I fight myself?  I know all my tricks, I know all my moves, and all my arguments.  So how do I do it?  I'd like to know...but then once I know how, I won't be able to pull it off because "I'll" know.

      Is it wrong to enjoy a movie that is thoroughly awful??  Well although that's a rhetorical question, if it did have an answer it is certainly no.  If it were wrong to be entertained by bad movies, I would have a very small movie collection.  Actually I do have a small movie collection but that's beside the point.   So yes, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, terrible.  It is based on a graphic novel.  Which, for those of you who are unaware, is like a big comic book.  Anyway the graphic novel is actually British in origin.  But as we all know, American audiences tend not to understand anything British, either by choice or by genetics.  So in they bring the allegedly attractive Shane West as Tom Sawyer.  And aside from one good joke at the expense of the American character, it just takes away from the dynamic of the GC.  In fact the GC is actually incredibly light on action.  But I don't consider it worth writing a review of, you can go see it or not.  I think it has something to offer, whether it's a good or bad thing would be up to the viewer.  Just keep your expectations low.  Bottom line, Sean Connery still rocks, even though he hasn't made a good movie in 20 years.

      Going to see a movie tonight.  At least I think I am.  Reviews will follow.  I know this is dated, but anyone who though The Matrix: Reloaded sucked donkey balls say "aye".    So let's see....it'll either be the loveable Yeti Sean Connery in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  Or Johnny Depp and uber-hottie Orlando Bloom in Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl.  As long as it's good summer fare I care not.  I am hardly expecting a cinematic masterpiece.  I mean hey, a movie like Demolition Man is only made once in a lifetime.  How that got shut out at the Oscars I have no idea.  Speaking of terrible movies.  I bought Independance Day on DVD today...hooray for bonus features.  Oh well, I never bought it on VHS, so I'm allowed to get it now.  As I am currently too poor to repurchase me VHS collection (not that it's large) on DVD.  I don't think I have anything else to comment on right now.  Talk about sad.  If I wasn't going to pack boxes all night I'd watch the news and write a brilliant response to some story that was on.  Oh yes....and the hands down best use of a cowbell in a song is most defiantely "Don't Fear the Reaper" by Blue Oyster Cult.  Just so you know.  Close second award goes to "Hey Ladies" by the Beastie Boys.  Man this blog is vapid beyond belief.  Yay.

      Why is it that when I try to write bad poetry is turns out great and when I try to write good poetry it sucks.  I'd write it on paper, tear it up and throw it out, but there's no point.  Birds won't even use them in their nests.  How long have I been doing this blog, and I've already stolen like 10 Simpsons jokes.  Matt Groening is gonna have my head.

       What can you do with a day?  What will you wake up and see?  The farther you get the closer to me.  -Dar Williams "Closer to Me "  I am not sure what the point of putting those lyrics there is.  It would make more sense to put something that I wrote there.  But to be honest, most of the poetry I write is so dark it frightens even me.  Therefore it remains locked away.  Today has been a day like any other really.  Working in the morning, and a long nap became necessary.  And so after drueling plenty and leaving my throat dry enough to sing Bonny Tyler songs I am now awake trying to figure out what to do with my evening.  Packing should be on the agenda, as it's basically 2 weeks til the big day and the more prepared the better.  Ah, screw that being prepared is a boy scouts thing.  And I ain't no f*cking boyscout.  The unfortunate thing about napping in the afternoon is that I am now going to be groggy for the next 5 hours.  So anyone who is on MSN with me right now keep in mind that my brain no work good now.  I'll write something else later...because I don't have anything to say at the moment.  And because I think I'm going to give into temptation and get an insanely large slice of pizza from accross the street.

      I suppose you're all wondering where I got the name for this blog.  Well perhaps not but I'll tell you anyhow.  One day while feeling disallusioned, as I am apt to do, I made up a second hotmail address because I was going to use it for junk mail and such.  That never did happen and I'm sure that account has closed.  During this time I was a student at St. Mary's University in Halifax, which is essentially the capital of the generic.  I have never been anywhere that I felt more left out than while attending SMU.  And since is seemed as though my uniqueness was something to be ashamed of I tried to remain a cog in the gritty machine.  This of course did alot more harm than good for me.  Now I have had a theory for a number of years of: "Unique in mind, not in body."  That is not to say that I look down upon people who take it upon themselves to look different on the outside.  Far from it.  My belief is simply that for me, I can be very a unique person who thinks differently from the majority and still look like an unassuming dork.  Who needs crazy piercings and tattoos when you have thought?    I still often feel as though the 'majority rulez' as I don't seem to fit in anywhere.  And indeed I guess I can say that I subscribe to the theory that sheep go to heaven and goats go to hell.  Goats being people who are different.  Bla bla bla...it's also a great song by the band Cake.  Do I believe the majority always rulez??  No.  However with all the pressure in our society for people to "fit in", it can certainly be a big factor in peoples lives.

      I hate food.  Food is the beign of my existance.  Because to say I hate food is a lie, I love food, I can eat all the time.  I eat when I'm hungry, I eat when I'm bored, I eat for the sake of eating.  This food obsession is gonna get me in trouble some day.  My arteries are probably just as gross as Halifax Harbour.  Although I don't think I have condoms floating around my arteries.  Stupid food...I'm completely hooked.  Only by the grace of some unknown force am I not 300 pounds.  I remember the days when I used to be an athlete, ah those were the days.  The days before I had a job and made my own money.  The days when I couldn't eat out all the time.  I swear there must be addictive additives in fast food.  Because nobody in there right mind would want to continuously eat it if they could choose not to.  I don't want to eat fast food, and yet I do.  It practically brings me to tears sometimes...well not quite, but perhaps someday.  Because it seems as though I can't stop myself, like something makes me do it.  Maybe they put mind control devices in the hamburgers, and there is a massive control center that targets people with technological voodoo, forcing them to eat their greasy disgusting food.  Why am I whining about this anyway?  That's not a rhetorical question, somebody needs to tell me.  And the first person who says it's because I'm a native Maritimer is gonna end up with a broken limb or three.  Now if you'll excuse me I am going to go purge and read a non-threatening Boys magazine.

      Ah I see how this works.  *Sigh* I am about as computer savvy as a blind lemur, and am equally as likely to jump off cliffs.  So yes what an exciting day.  I went to my parents house as I do on most Sundays, to visit and make use of the free laundry facilities.  My parents are renovating the house and it's coming along nicely.  I ended up moving furniture, which was completely unexpected, and has led me to the epiphany that I had better hit the gym before I move into my new apartment at the end of the month.  My roommates are packing, it's all so very exciting really....I mean it....it's just soooo exciting.  Of course I am aware that I had better start packing lest I leave it to the last minute and break all my stuff.  Of which there is very little.  Does anyone else think that Paul Martin needs to have an anvil dropped on his head?  I know that just comes out of nowhere, but I mean seriously, the guy can't be trusted.  You don't trust someone who is rich to handle your money, they tend not to have a great sense of fiscal responsibility.  Not that I do.  I mean, I eat out more that I sleep it seems so I guess I'm not one to talk.  Stupid bickering roomies...Man, I am going to revell in my own place.  I love these two but they drive me nuts.  If I am ever in a relationship and I act like that someone kill me in an absolutely horrible fashion.  Perhaps force me to listen to Avril Lavigne while forcing me to watch wrestling.  That's a pretty horrible way to go.  OK, I've actually disturbed myself.  Oh well, I will go vomit now and then I'll come up with a plan to write something more intelligent.

      I don't actually know what the word firmament means.  It is simply the title of a song by Dar Williams.  I suppose I should look it up before using it to describe something, but I don't own a dictionary, so I guess I'm stuck.  And I don't think that saying "man that guys ass if firmament" is correct usage.  This being my first post I suppose I should write something of myself.  So that way if anyone was actually reading this they could follow along comfortably and understand what on earth I am talking about.  First things first:  If you are going to follow this site keep in mind I have no life so you will likely be able to look in every couple of weeks and not miss anything.  But I suppose you never know perhaps ranting over the internet will become my new favourite passtime.  My name is Dane, I am 23, I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  I was born and raised here etc.  I am gay, I likes men etc.  Perhaps I'll discuss that later who knows.  I like sports, I like movies where things get blown up, ditto for video games.  I'm a big fan of the Dynasty Warriors series because nothing is more cathartic than hacking hundreds of people to death.  I am manic-depressive, but I get by.  I am currently a student at Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax.  I wrote for the school paper "Jargon" this past year focusing on being editor of a section on 'Sexuality'.  This coming year I will be co-editor of the paper and will continue to write about sex and sexuality as it is something I am interested in.  Moreso academically than in practice, honestly.  I don't enjoy sex all that much and don't tell me it's because I've never been with anyone good because believe me that's not the case.  Oh and I should mention that my grammar sucks.  Taking two and a half years off school tends to weaken some of those skills.  But hopefully in time it'll all come back to me and my nightmare of red marks all over my essays will end.  Damn comma splices, I hate them so much.  So anyhow.  I am a huge fan of The Simpsons.  Indeed I love cartoons, especially Saturday morning cartoons from the 80's, and many of the modern sitcom animated shows.  Everyone write to MTV to make sure the produce another season of "Clone High".  That's a great great show.  Well that's me in a nutshell I guess.  There'll be more to tell I'm sure, and all of it as equally boring as this.

      Actually to her credit though...that is the girl in my prior entry...She was the first person to ever ask me if I was gay.  I should have told her 'yes'.  I wish I had said yes to the other few people who asked me that when I was closeted.  Not as though things would have been better that way.  Just because I am curious as to what would have happened.

      So I'm desperately waiting for my counsellor to come back from vacation because when he gets back he's getting me into the clinic so I can get some meds, praise jesus, because only the lord knows I can't go on this way especially with school starting.  Haha I am the king of the run-on sentence.  I'm still trying to figure out how I am supposed to co-edit the school paper when I have no grammar skill whatsoever.  Well that's probably the least of my problems in terms of that situation.  How about that I did nothing about it all summer, the other editor was in Prague all summer, I don't know if we'll have the money to publish, at least by the first publishing date.  I don't know whether we'll have anyone writing for the paper, and more importantly I don't even know why I'm doing it.  I suppose it has something to do with the former editor believing that I was the right person for the job.  Although personally I still believe it's a big conspiracy because people just want to watch me crash and burn.  But I mean if that's the goal just sit me down and make me listen to "It Won't Rain All The Time" by Jane Siberry and see what happens.  You know, I'm just doing the whole..."I don't know how I'll ever make it" thing.  Honestly, I have no idea how I made it through last year.  I had meds for most of that, and that helps.  But still, and especially the 2nd semester the meds started failing and I really stopped doing well.  Looking back it's amazing I passed a couple of my classes and wrote for the paper, and worked, let along finished the year with a not incredibly terrible GPA.  Mind you the lack of structure in that sentence should knock me down a grade point.  Thank goodness this isn't a school project.  My entries are too long, nobody wants to read this stuff.  But there's one story I feel like telling.  I'm working the other day, and this girl comes up, and I know her and she knows me, she's friends with my older sister.  And she wants to buy a chair, it's a cool chair, good for her.  But then this girls sister, who is my age comes in.  Words can never express the contempt I feel for this person.  I went to school with her for 10 years and not once did she make me feel like I was anything even close to human.  I despise her, and I always will.  I suppose it's a good thing I don't consider myself catholic anymore, otherwise I would be forced to forgive her.  I'm sure she's quite the mature and wonderful person now.  I mean we all grow up.  I haven't even talked to her in 8 years, aside from the hello I gave her when she came in the store.  However, sometimes I think people are forgiven too easily for past transgressions.  Or at least it's passed off as "oh well that's what kids do.  They just need to grow up."  Do you want to know why I hate guns so much??  It's because I'm afraid of what I would do if there was one in my hand.

      Speaking of DVD's, why is the stuff I want so damned expensive.  I mean, hello, the Star Trek series dvd's are like $150 per season.  Plus I would love to get all of the Dr. Who stuff.  I need to find a way to make some money.  It's a shame I know nothing about html programming, otherwise I could just start a crummy porn site and get cash from silly horny people who buy memberships without thinking with the upper brain.  Hmmm that's got me thinking.  There is much to do.  Or actually not do, but I'm trying to make you think I am doing it.  I suppose I'm ruining it by telling you.  Oh well.

      I have so much to do, and so much time to do it in.  So why is it I'm not doing any of it?  Rhetorical questions are fun my friends.  True dat, as some may say.  Am I unhappy?  No.  Comtemplative would probably be the best description.  I'm like a little boy, cowering in a corner.  Partly fearing my imminant failure, and slightly fearing any possible success.  OOoohhh rhetorical nonsense...anyhow don't misunderstand this brief entry, it's just a couple of sentences with no real meaning.  I want to add more but I should go to bed, and I ain't not making the sense anyways.

      I guess it was time for a change.  That's the kind of thing I have been telling myself for a long time.  Time for a change.  "Farewell to the Old me", as they say...or at least my favourite singer/songwriter Dar Williams says in a song of the same name from most recent CD, "The Beauty of The Rain".  Now I praddle on.  My ex was in twon on Friday night and dragged me out to NRG.  It's not that I had a bad time, but if I'm not dancing I get really uncomfortable, and since there was nothing at all played that Iwanted to dance to I was left to be uncomfortable.  That not withstanding my ex prancing around like he was the Queen of Siam.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.  But thanks to Dallas who allowed me to keep from freaking out and being utterly miserable while I was there.  There were some other friends of mine there but they were drunk, so it's not quite the same as when they are sober and can relate to me.  Plus they were tickling me, which as everyone knows ticks me off.  So I actually put my friend Woody in an arm bar breifly.  That was amusing, he was quite surprised that I did it actually.  But hey, as much as my inferiority complex argues otherwise...I am full of surprises.  Or maybe it's full of shit, one of those two anyways.

      I officially declare Mitsou to be the greatest musical artist of all time.  Someone has to say it.    Now with that aside.  Yes of late I have reindulging myself in music...I love music for those of you who don't know.  Essentially I really like just about anything.  But especially songs from my past, the kind that tend to illicit positive emotion, or an emotion of some kind.  There are some songs which just remind me of various moments in time, and to listen to them almost puts me back in that moment.  Despite what I may have led people to believe, not all the moments of my life have been negative.  Quite a few mind you, and chemical imbalances tend to make those bad moments seem like great tragedies.  Who reads this site anyway??  I know of two people for sure, and of course those are the only two people with my email address too.  I want to know what kind of direction people think I should take with this blog.  I really don't know.  My mind is usually all over the place so it's hard to focus on one thing unless I know what it is going in.  See I'm not making any sense.    "It was that cocky janitor Glen!!!"

      Thank you everyone for your outcries of support.  But as I believe I wrote(I'm too lazy to go check) I did not write that blog because I was looking for support or sympathy.  Regardless thank you for showing you care.  But let it go, I was in a pretty horrid mood that night.  I suppose I still am, and yes I am afflicted with this condition and have yet to find a way to cure it or aleviate it.  But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up.  Because I know that if I stop trying to make myself better...sometime down the road, I won't be around.  That's not meant to sounds grim but it's the truth.  So anyways....yeah...don't stop caring, but I'll be fine.

      On another note, after reading one of Johnny's posts I was inspired to go take some quizzes at thespark.com which is a site I hadn't visited in a while.  And I am not tryin to steal your thunder by posting my results Johnny, but after the last entry anyone reading may want a lark.  So yes, I am 50% gay, which is 7% more gay than the last time I took the quiz...I'm not sure why.  I am 66% dateable.  According to their personality test I am a Mastermind(Submissive Introvert Abstract Thinker).  I am 48% sexy, which is giving me credit I think.  And I will have sex with 28 people in my life.  I'm curious as to what their definition of "sex" is.  Because the number of partners I have had varies depending on that....and I very much doubt I would have "sex" with 28 people in my life.  If that were the case I've got a long way to go.

      So.......  So yes apologies for not updating in a long time.  Aside from moving I have been putting it off because I honestly have nothing good to say, and by that I mean I'm likely to write something horribly depressing.  Today is my birthday by the way.  Thank you Dallas for my wonderful card.  I hate birthdays.  Not because of getting older, or anything like that.  Just because it's a day that doesn't warrant celebration.  Although sometimes I think that the fact that I managed to live another year does warrant some form of celebration.  Recently a friend of mine pointed out something about my behaviour.  He said "Do you think that by trying to make people stay away from you, you are in fact doing the opposite and making them want to know you more."  I'm paraphrasing, he was more articulate than I am being.  When I think about it, it's a valid point.  I guess I come accross as being mysterious to alot of people, and this is intentional in that I don't like giving alot of myself up to people.  And yet at the same time I am forthcoming with people, but usually only with things that I hope will drive them away from me.  There are few people on earth who know me well.  Indeed even my best friends would not be able to claim that they know me all that well.  Because I do not talk about many things with people.  Subjects that aren't talked about in detail:  1. My Depression 2. My hatred for myself 3. My lack of will to live 4. Severity of depression 5. Suicide 6. My hopes to die everyday  I've got more but you get the idea.  And no, typing those out for all to see provides no catharsis whatsoever.  It honestly makes no difference if people know or not, because everyone offers the same help and nobody really gets it.  Although I fault nobody for that because at least they try, and I can't explain my feelings sometime anyway.  I had a Psycholgist promise to cure my depression.  He doesn't return my calls.  Hahaha, I think I'm too far gone for him.  And as I get older I am actually getting worse.  Time was that I could hide it well enough, I never used to have problems getting up and going to work or whatever.  Now over the past year it's nearly cost me my job because I don't want to get up in the morning to face it.  I had gone to see another Psychologist once and he was absolutely shocked that I had a job, and left my house.  He was also shocked that I was even still alive.  And do you want to know why I am still alive??  Because I have a conscience.  I cannot hurt my family like that.  So I live for them, because it's the only reason I can think of.  I hate being alive.  I hate getting up in the morning.  I hate going to sleep at night.  I hate inhaling, I hate exhaling.  But most of all I hate myself for being this way.  There now you know that I'm nuts :)  So I suggest that you re-evaluate whether or not you truly wish to know me.

      It's funny that I am so afraid to talk to my parents.  Indeed I just don't want to disappoint them, although I invariably do things to that affect.  Even though they would never say they were disappointed in me.  They just want consultation.  I think the time has come to confess everything, and to let them into what my life is like, starting from way back and coming up to the present.  And I thought coming out of the closet was going to be hard.  Imagine having to tell your parents that 90% of your waking thought has been devoted to wanting to kill yourself, and that said thoughts have existed for almost 20 years.  And imagine even more having to explain that the only reason you haven't followed through on said thoughts is that you would never want to hurt them, and thusly you stay alive for them.  It's not likely to go over well.  And I'm not going to do it to soften the blow of decisions I have made recently.  But rather, I think that everyone has been kept in the dark long enough.  I make allusions to certain things, but I rarely blatantly speak of my thoughts or feelings.  And even to those people who are reading this thinking that I have opened up...well...I still keep quite a bit to myself, actually almost everything to myself.  The glimpses I give don't tell the whole story.  Anyhow I needed to type something because I have been trying to sleep and failing miserably...as usual my thoughts are eating me alive.  Lousy carnivorous negative thoughts...curse you and the horse you rode in on.  To the sky I look, The distance and the awe, But rather is seems to me,  that the sky is close at hand, hanging above, falling perhaps, graying clouds, thunder strikes, I cry crimson tears, and then the sun rises, and all is calm and innocent once more.  Really bad grade 11 poetry...I'm not sure I remembered it all right, but I'm not about to go searching through stuff to find the correct version.

      So I went for a very late walk.  It lasted about an hour.  I like it when the world is quiet, in fact, I think my mind may have even quieted itself for about five minutes.  Although it does need to be said that boats on the dark water of the harbour at 3:45am are damn creepy!!!  So why did I go for a walk?  Good question, I'm glad I asked.  Of course I can't answer it.  I just wanted to take some time to think, somewhere that wasn't this apartment, or work.  I've been rather preoccupied all night, trying to think of what to do, and trying desperately not to do certain other things.  OH I am trying to be optimistic people...I'm trying so hard...but the effort is straining, in fact it's exhausting.  I may have a plan, I'm not sure there's alot to think about.  And if there's one thing that I have come to hate it's thinking.  Oh how I hate my brain...contstantly questioning, telling, tricking....talking!!!  It never stops!  But I suppose I'm not the only one who suffers that...except that my brain is constantly telling me what a miserable fuck up I am...and then it floods me with memories that should be forgotten, and my defenses weaken and fall and I give in.  And then I type nonsense like this.

      I was trying to make a nice pastel work for my friend, because I owe it to him...let's just say my first effort has turned out a miserable failure.  And I'm not being overly harsh either, I know a little something about miserable failure after all.    "Yeah and now I'm runnin' down this camp town drive, with your laughter in my head, and I'll have to block it out some how to survive.  Cause those dreams a dre dead, and I'm alive"   That's from a very very good Jackson Browne song called "I'm Alive"...taken out of context that sounds really depressing eh.  Of course I think I have the camp town drive part wrong I'm not sure what kind of drive he says he's going down.  Rest assured that drive is correct though.  I mean, really probably the most depressing song for me to hear is Duncan Sheik's "Reasons for Living" which is a song that I usually only listen to if I feel an overwhelming need to cry...and please keep in mind that crying can be cathartic is doesn't have to be a bad thing.  "Even my wonder, even my fear.  Only amount to a couple of tears.  There is a rythm, it's near and it's far and it goes to the heart of us.  It's already in you, it's already there.  You may disagree but I don't really care..."  Of course I haven't unpacked my CD's so I can't find the CD inlay to get the lyrics and I'm not in the mood to find them on the net.  Well I will but I'm not gonna post it here...nuts to that.  haha....oh Burton Cummings...hahahaha...fine state of affairs...is a great song just so everyone knows.

      I am so weak, once again succumbing to that which will bring inevitable misery.  What am I thinking??  Why??  If I know what it will do to me why do it??  The last thing I need at the moment is stupid things like this.  I'm missing classes, not getting organised...I'm gonna be so screwed by the end of the month.    My visit to the clinic at the Abbey Lane is on the 26th...which I have been thinking all this time is a Monday, but it's actually a Friday which means I had better get the time off work in the morning, otherwise I'll probably be working...and I can't afford to miss any work.  And I certainly can't afford to miss this appointment.  Ah well it should work out.  Anyhow I had best go off to bed.  I must get sleep so I can get up and make up for the jack and shit that I did today.  Indeed I need to make up for alot of things, and not just lost time.

        I have have taken that right turn at Albequerque    I can't spell that word for the life of me, and I don't care.  I was thinking tonight about how I got here.  I mean to this time in my life.  I wonder if in some alternate universe I made all the right decisions and am living happily, without despair.  And hopefully with Elijah Wood.  If indeed the theory is true that all things that can happen do happen.  Which if you really put some though into that means that in some other realities I am probably dead, in others I am living and happy, maybe in others I'm still closeted and engaged to a woman.  Well you never know I suppose.  Bah, nothing else to say.

      Why is it that sleep resets everything.  When I go to bed at night I resolve to do better, to get my shit together.  And I know that I can.  But then when I wake up in the morning it's all gone, and I can barely resolve to move my flabby ass out of from under the quilt.  And then I go to foolish things such as get taken in by sweet words from someone who has about as much relevant things to say as Colin Powell.  Why oh why???  I should know better than that, I can see right through the language and I knew what he wanted.  He just wanted company, and he still does.  Not relationship company he just wants someone to cuddle with.  Which is fine, everyone wants companionship and everyone expresses that in there own way.  Now personally, I like to be able to have a conversation with the other person.  That's just me.  And then my weakness kicked in...because I am lonely...and so long story short (pardon the pun) I have officially seen an 8.5 inch penis.  Please tell me Signa that you did not give this URL to Mom and Dad.  That would be quite traumatising.  So as usual, I am now who knows how far behind in school.  And I don't seem to care much.  There is so much red tape and politics going on with the school paper that I just want to let it die.  It's not really worth it, I'm not even sure what I am going to writing in it this year.  The co-editor has suggested that maybe I should do something about depression...write what you know as it were.  And that's probably not a bad idea.  If I can write about it on the net, why not in a student paper.  Oh well something to think about.

      The thought just occured to me that perhaps I really do need to move home.  I have no doubt that things will start to turn around soon anyway.  But perhaps adding that safety net of ever present unconditional love will aid the process.  Of course there are many things which would have to take place.  I would have to inform my landlord of course.  I am not bound to a lease here, but they were kind enough to give me this apartment, and I am not out to betray that trust/kindness.  But on the other hand, perhaps I need to start being a little more selfish, and deciding what will make my life better.  Then of course, Mom and Dad would have to say yes.  And it is fair to say that most of my stuff would have to go into storage, and I would be happy to pay for that in place of the rent I am paying here.  It was just a thought I had.  In fact I have it alot.  Part of me just doesn't want to admit that my old psychologist was right.  That I am better off at home.  It is true that I hate being in the environment where people do things for me.  But I also hate being in the environment where I have all the control, it is because of that that I have spent the past 72 hours holed up in here fearing to go outside and to have to face people.  Aside from getting horribly unhealthy food I have stayed in, slept the long days, ate the awful meals, frustrated at my inability to stop myself, and yet pleased that I am succeeding in my own destruction.  Are there two me's, I sometimes think to myself.  Are there more?  What is it like to have more than one personality?  Must they both manifest in ways that are obvious to other people?  I'm not a psychology student.  I have no idea.  When you sit alone at 4am thinking these things, there must be something truly wrong with you.  I live out every day hoping that that one event will happen, that one thing that will change everything for me.  Of course life doesn't work that way.  Epiphany's are hard to come by, especially for those who seem to not want to have one.  Paradox, you say?  Well perhaps, although likely not in the truest meaning of the word.  But since I don't know the truest meaning of the word I can use it in this way.  So I call myself a paradox, either because I believe it to be true or because I think the word sounds cool.  One of the two.  The first thing that any counsellor or psychologist or what have you will ask you is "How long have you felt this way?"  To which I answer always.  Or at least as long as I have memory, but it has been getting worse as I get older.  The follow up question is usually "Why do you think you feel this way?"  To which I respond I don't know.  Because I truly don't know.  I hardly have the right to be this way, nothing particularly tragic has ever happened to me.  I don't know how I became this way, and I don't know why, and if I did know why...why on earth would I be seeking counselling trying to find the answer to that question.  More inane ramblings.  I'm trying to figure out if I should just stay up all night or should go to sleep and set my alarm early as though I were just going for a nap.  The problem there is that I know what will happen if I go to sleep.  I will set my alarm, and it will wake me up, and I will simply get up and turn it off and crawl back to bed, after having reset it for the time I need to be up to go to work.  And it will go off again, and I will turn it off, and I will rest my eyes, and low and behold I'll wake up with only 20 minutes to get to work on time.  That is what happens.  I am so predictable.  My eyes feel tired but that might be only from looking at this screen.  I slept for a very long time yesterday.  And there are things I need to do, and if I try to sleep, I'll end up doing none of them.

      So yes I am finally writing again.  I made another addition to my home today.  Yes I now have another roommate.  The Care Bear known as Grumpy has come to live with me.  So now I have 4 roommates...Grumpy, Topper the Penguin, the stuffed cat which still has no name and my other personality Peyso.  Peyso rarely surfaces, because he is the confident organised and incredibly smooth version of me.  But he's around, and he says hi.  I need to start writing some articles for the school paper, which is still going forward despite my complete incompetence and neglect.  If Peyso were in control I certainly wouldn't be in this predicament.  I feel like I could use some Ritalin right about now.  I have been on it before, and it's very helpful to me...because I can't concentrate on anything for very long.  I get bored with this awfully quick, and the only reason I haven't gotten bored with it already is because I've got some people messaging me as I type.  So I can break concentration on this and move to something else.  And then come back to type some more but lose my train of thought.  So anyway I cloned a sheep.  Wait a minute.  Where was I??    Invisible Robot Fish.  Hmmm.....When I can't stops my fiddelin' I just takes me Ritalin I'm poppin and sailin' man!!     Special thanks to The Simpsons for always knowing exactly what to end an episode with.

      It has occurred to me over the past couple of days that I love music.  This is hardly an epiphany, but it is funny how I don't listen to much music when I'm feeling down.  A special friend of mine who happens to be named after a city in the fine state of Texas made a CD for me which helped remind me of that.  I am currently listening to a CD of my own ecclectic taste...and It's putting a smile on my face.  So the next step is to try to make a CD for this friend of mine.  Turnabout is fairplay after all.  I finally had the talk with the parents about leaving school.  They weren't upset at all, except when I alluded to things I'm sure they didn't want to hear about.  So I didn't continue that line of the conversation.  Really I don't think my parents have to hear all about my inner pain to be able to feel compassion for me.  Indeed the last thing a parent wants to hear is that one of their children hates being alive, and has wanted to die for a long time.  And thusly I will not say these words to them.  But rather just make sure that they understand that the inner workings of my mind are not all smiles and sunshine.  But of course they only want me to get better, and they support my decision to leave school for the time being.  And obviously support my getting help, and also wish to help any way they possibly can.  I am blessed to have the family I have, I truly am, and I know it's what keeps me here.  So I have pretty much decided that I have a major crush on this guy that I met.  The problem is that I haven't heard tell of him in a week and I am starting to become paranoid.  This is the problem that comes hand in hand with feeling better.  When I am depressed I don't mind being alone at all.  However when I emerge from that I really want to find someone...then the question becomes "do I actually like this guy, or am I just desperate."  I honestly don't know.  I want to find that out, but I can't do that if he's avoiding me or not interested in talking to me anymore.  I am very confused by this current situation, and bothered as well.  I mean, I want to see him and talk to him so much I even went to NRG briefly on Friday night hoping he would be there...and for those of you who know me....You know what a big deal that is!!  Haha, I'm being such a silly boy...it's pathetic, but cute and funny at the same time so I guess all I can do is smile and try not to focus on it too much.

      Wow I can't believe I haven't written anything all week.  I suppose I should be changing the date and time on these as it seems it is never correct.  For example it is now Thursday Oct. 16, 2003 at 4:00am, I'm sure it'll say something different after I finish posting.  I cannot sleep.  I do not know why I cannot sleep, but I couldn't even settle my mind or body for more than a minute whilst attempting to sleep so I thought perhaps I would come on here type something out then try it again.  Type what out I'm not entirely sure.  My night at work just plain sucked.  There's no good reason for that it just did, the last part of it anyway.  I have been letting that bother me, among other things.  As I constantly do, I allow past events to bother me...making up hypothetical "if I had done this" situations in my head thinking about past events that I can't possibly go back and change.  And even if I could the likelihood of them happening the same way again are very good.  I have met someone that I believe intrigues me.  Whether or not this person is interested in me even for friendship is uncertain.  However there is something interesting to me about a person who pays no attention to politics and doesn't watch The Simpsons.  I never said this intrigue was a good thing.  But maybe it is, who knows...it seems that once again my old arch nemesis Time will be the deciding factor.  Damn you Time, you've won again!!!  If time is of the essence.  Then wouldn't the present be of the convalesance (can't spell that word)??

      For those that would like to know I now have power.  It finally came back on tonight almost a full 10 days after it first went out.  Thank goodness for family and friends with power, because I can only stand the sound of my brain so long.  Nevertheless the hurricaine was good for me it would seem.  If I may be so selfish as to say so.  Almost as if my own storm had passed.  Of course there is much I need to get sorted out, and a couple of hard things to decide and to say to people.  The other thing I would like to note as I write this, is that this is the happiest I have felt in as long as I can remember.  I don't know what it is, but for some reason all day...or most of it anyways I have felt comfortable in my own skin as you might say.  That was one of the questions the psychologist asked me on Monday, "How comfortable do you feel in your own skin?".  Interesting question eh?  I thought it was.  I constantly fidget, whether I am calm or nervous I can't sit still unless I am holding myself in some way, arms crossed, legs crossed etc.  Anyhow I thought that was interesting.  A girl at work asked me today "What's with you tonight." and I said "I guess you could almost say I'm happy, if I'm cured somehow I'll probably be like this all the time.  Do you think I'm acting weird."  She said "No it's just nice to see you this way."  And it probably is, for those who are witness to my day to day stupor the happy me must be a stark contrast.  I'm practically dancing a merry jig right now.  It won't last, I know that...it will probably reset in the morning.  But I want to mark the date, so that I will know at least, that it's possible for me to step out of my shadow and to feel the light on my skin.

      I still have no power.  But I'm sure it'll be coming soon.  And yes once again I could allude to the fact that not having power can be taken in more than one way...but once again let us go for the literal sense.    I cast a magic spell to allow myself this brief time to update my blog.  Indeed I am a powerful sorceror, conjuror if you will.  They call me Granger the master of Gray Magic.  At least they do in my head.  Damn I just realised that I need a number that I left at the apartment...I also have no phone service...and I should probably call and confirm the appointment that I have on Monday...oops...oh well there's still time.  Anyhow gotta go for now...yes yes...but I'll be back....yesss precious....I'll be back.

      I for some reason want to cry.  There's no reason for it whatsoever but I'm almost thinking it's necessary.  Just for the sake of purging.  I've really been doing a number on myself the past few months with my diet.  I eat crap and now I'm paying for it.  I feel like crap.  It's so hard for me to get out of bed.  And there are so many things I need to be changing.  The most painful thing is that I know this, and yet nothing has changed.  What's up with that.  One of the main things I don't like about me, is the rather large schism between knowledge and action.  If I know I need to change certain things than you would think that I could easily change them.  But I don't work that way.  So on the other hand American Thanksgiving is this week, the day that usually marks the beginning of the Christmas season.  At least it does in my eyes.  Specials should start airing around December 1st.  Not like it makes a huge difference because I have them all on tape anyway, but still I like to watch them when they air.  The quality of picture is better off of the TV than off of a tape made a couple years ago.  Third paragraph.  I want to have a relationship with this person.  I realise it has been a little over a week and I am looking to far ahead.  However he is talking about moving home in January until April, May, or June.  I personally don't like this prospect.  And am admittedly disheartened at the thought.  But I would wait, and I would hop on a bus to go visit.  I say this now of course.  There are at least 36 days until January and many things can change.  But then again, there are 6 hours until 8am, and many things can change.

      I guess my last Blog was censored.  I can't say I blame them due to the rather large amount of swearing that I did.  I apologise to the webmasters for that.  And apology...How Canadian of me.  So yeah I don't know what to say.  I feel like I should be dumping alot of stuff on this site, and yet I can't seem to do so.  I'm more empathetic than apathetic of late, I really care what's going on in other people's lives.  As things don't seem to be going to badly for me.  Although I have realised that I have screwed up a could of things big time, and once I come down from my high I am bound to punish myself for it.  But I digress.  For those of you who don't know, I guess I'm dating someone.  The reason I say I guess it because I find it hard to believe he wants to go out with me.  I mean, to me anyway...he seems at least superficially to be way out of my league.  Although time may teach me otherwise.  I do really like him, and I really hope this one goes somewhere.  I haven't met too many people (at least not in a romantic sense) who make me smile when I simply think of them.  Weird eh??  I don't really remember what it's like to be enamoured, it really only happened once before, and I am far removed from that feeling.  But anyways I shouldn't really talk about it much.  Because things are just starting out and things could change very quickly, very quickly indeed.

      First things first.  How did I ever live without the song "Shiny Disco Balls"???  I simply can't imagine life without it now.  I haven't felt this way since "Finally" by Cece Peniston. Has anyone ever noticed that she has penis in her last name??  Anyways....so yeah the past 24 hours have been a ride that would rival any rollercoaster.  Highs and lows, loops and spirals.  Anxiety, fun, contentment, anger, frustration, calm, serenity, rage....it's all been there and more.  Why??  I guess I'm just getting my hopes up, because something felt right.  But I shouldn't be too optimistic.  In fact in my experience it never pays for me to be optimistic because the feeling gets destroyed so easily.  For example I can even predict this behavior.  I said to my boss this morning, "I'm in a great mood, do you want to place a bet on what's gonna ruin it??".  Something always happens to ruin my good mood somehow...Today I made such an ignorant mistake and it's eating me up inside but I can't put it out of my mind.  Some of my co-workers have been trying to figure out what annoys me.  And if they ever read this site I'm about to give it away.    I HATE MAKING MISTAKES!!!!  Even small ones, I can't stand it.  Especially at work because I know my job so well, it shouldn't matter if I don't sleep at all the night before a shift I shouldn't make stupid mistakes.  But I do, and it's annoying.  Fucking hell!!  I'm gonna head for a nap.

      Man am I ever lethargic.  I sleep wayyyyy tooooo much.  I think my diet is completely fucked up.  I mean, of course it's fucked up.  I've been doing it to myself for a while.  So now it's time to change.  And although I did just finish eating McD's, it is officially the last one I am having until the New Year for sure.  No fast food unless it is Subway or a Salad.  And I need to ask my Dad to take me grocery shopping tomorrow as well.  I need to have good food here to eat if I'm going to do this.  I wake up in the morning feeling like shit.  So this needs to change, so that I can use my days for something constructive.  I didn't realise it has been so long since I've written anything.  Not that much happened.  Johnny came to visit, that was nice.  Ummmm....I ain't got nothin'...that's what I mean with the "lethargic-ness", I should have stories to tell but I ain't got shit.    But at least I can say that this is by far my most curse filled blog to date.  Shit fuck fuck ass boobs crap pubes bush fuck shit.

      Have you seen me???  Have you truly seen me???  Thoughts pervade my waking time.  I crave to find myself.  I suppose it's no less then any other person wants.  I still don't honestly know what it is I am capable of.  Indeed lately I have been so spastic I can barely sit still for 5 minutes.  At the times when I feel like I have grown, when I feel happier and more contented...these are the times when I am probably the most scared.  It feels to me almost as though if I were to actually come into my self, and simply realise what it is I am....that if this happened I could destroy the world.  That is how powerful I sometimes feel.  I don't know why.  I certainly don't think I can destroy the world, nor can I change the world.  Indeed I realise that at this rate I won't even make a contribution to the world other than to gobble up it's rapidly reducing resources in my personal quest for self-destruction.  THere are times when I envy Religious people.  Although I do believe in a higher power and in many other things that science can't explain.  I don't believe in them enough to be able to turn to it in my darkest moments.  Which begs the question of course:  If you don't have faith in yourself, how can you have faith in anything??  I'm sure you're reading this thinking I'm depressed again.  This is not the case, although I would say please keep in mind that I am never "not depressed".  Just depressed to lesser degrees.  I honestly don't think I'll ever be cured, mildly satiated perhaps but a cure isn't likely.  It is so deeply rooted within me to feel this way.  Maybe I am too smart for my own good??  That is possible I think.  I question things that don't need to be questioned.  And I analyse things that don't need to be analysed.  Give a little love, and you get a little love.  But if you give alot of love baby, you can get alot of love.  Some words to live by from Ken Tobias :)    Goodnight all.

      I lost a blog in here somewhere.  Well that is to say the last one I wrote seems to have disappeared.  I'm sure it was my fault but it still upsets me.  So I went to see Return of The King tonight.  It was great, I could nitpick about the story changes forever but I don't because it works anyway.  As most people know I find Elijah Wood to be super duper attractive.  But really there is a more existential reason for my like of him.  Don't get me wrong, I find him sexy, I respect his acting ability, and enjoy his personality in interviews.  But it's those eyes of his.  I look in his eyes and I can see my salvation, not as in my salvation is Elijah Wood.  Moreso that they are windows into wonder.  I feel when I look that somewhere I can shake my burdens, where all is well and I am happy.  I know it sounds strange.  That's because it is.  But the feeling always fades when those big blue pools aren't there to gaze into.  The clouds move in and it's impossible to see clearly again.  Man I hope he doesn't read this, I'm making myself sound like a big ole freak.  How very un-Christmasy I feel right now.  How very lost I am.  I guess you could say I feel like the sword that was broken, and I am waiting for the Elves to reforge me.  But alas, since Elves aren't real, I suppose I will remain shattered.

      It's always funny how the strangest things upset you.  Unfortunately of late, in the past couple of days anyway, I have been more open to negative thoughts than I have been.  This is not a good thing.  The last thing I need is to get depressed before Christmas, since I usually have alot of trouble getting through the season without feeling sad that Christmas is over, or feeling trepidations over the pointless year to come.  It is also funny to realise what a tenuous hold you have on things.  I probably could have gone to bed happy tonight, but I saw one thing and now happiness will not occur until the bliss of sleep has taken me.  Oh how I hate my waking hours.  I don't even think falling in love could cure that (no, I am not falling in love that's just an example).  And yet I am aware of many things.  The joy that I have been feeling can remain if I stay positive and follow the course of treatment.  I also realise that if I fail this time at ridding myself of such negative thoughts and emotions, I probably won't get another shot at it.  I will never be able to articulate exactly what it's like in my head.  I don't think I would want to either.  Nobody needs to know that stuff.  People shouldn't have to hear about it, but then again, I shouldn't have to live with it.  But I do.  For now, at least.  Live with it.

      Wow I honestly hadn't realised how long it has been since I've posted anything.  The crying remark is now funny due to something that happened earlier today.  So I am still dating guy without a name.  He shall remane nameless until I'm sure he actually feels something for me.  No jinxing at the moment thanks.  Well anyways my Christmas spirit is about as good as it gets despite my current financial problems.  I can't do any shopping until the 18th, and probably will need to finish on the 24th.  My January rent is going to be sooooo late, but I am also moving out of that apartment at the end of January.  Yes I gave my notice, so now another thing I will have to decide is what to do with myself come that time.  These things will probably be discussed at the parents tomorrow.  Ah, it has been a very bad day.  Things aren't so bad at the moment.  But the day won't be over for another 90 minutes or so, so anything can happen I guess.

      Oh man I don't feel good right now.  Laura nad I went to Vortex on Saturday night.  She was sick on Sunday, apparently Adam isn't feeling great and I can assure everyone right now that I am also not feeling great.  I haven't thrown up or anything yet, but the operative word is yet.  This sickness will delay my writing about the story of running into the first boy I ever had a crush on.  Because I just can't sit here, I need to go lay down.  But I will say, that since I am sick I needed something better to watch than tv so I rented two movies.  I haven't watched the second one yet...but as for the first I'll just say I need to stop renting weird gay movies from Europe.  Bizarre!!!

      When I close my eyes I don't see any darkness.  There is a low and subtle light that shines before me.  It dangles there, sometimes near or sometimes far, but always straight ahead.  An omniscient prescence in my own vision.  And so I look forward to sleep, for it is the only time there is light.  And I can see it shine, and I can know that all is well, at least until my eyes open once more to the light of day.

      Why am I here at 4am??  I'm not even all that sure.  It's damn cold here by the computer and I am only in my boxers.  What fools us Dane's may be.  I for whatever reason felt the need to write out this brief passage.  This is not from me, although I occasionally come up with my own rather clever things.  It is written in At Swim, Two Boys...although the author is not named.  My grief on the sea, How the waves of it roll. For they heave between me,  And the love of my soul.  And my love came behind me, He came from the south. His breast to my bosom, His mouth to my mouth.       And there you have that little piece of poetry.  Damn beautiful if I do say so myself.

      What is love?  Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more.  Let's face it now, Haddaway did not have a way with lyrics.  He must have had some pretty messed up relationships.  Hmmm I don't think I came on here to talk about that.  I'm not sure what I came on here to write about.  I was listening to music in bed and it always makes me feel like coming out here to type something out.  What that thing is I have no idea.  Coolest chick in the world who wants to become an Egyptologist Laura has introduced me to the utterly bizarre show that is Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  The first cartoon I have ever seen that was definately written by members of the Marijuana Party.  Anyway check it out if you can, it's hilarious and so weird you'll forget what dimension you're in.    Right now I'm just stuck in a state of mass confusion.  I just don't seem to know anything.  I need to figure alot of things out but I seem unable to even figure out what the options are.  I'm very frustrated.  Hopefully after tomorrow night at least one thing will be sorted out.  I'm trying to figure out whether or not I am still together with "you know who" who is now in Fredericton, I'm not sure for how long.  I would very much like to know where I stood there, I just want to know whether I am single or not essentially.  Not like people have been beating down my door or anything.  I'm hoping I don't choke in my upcoming job interview.  It's not like it's the be all end all of jobs, but I really need to move on and I would like to do it before I get fired from my current job.  I really want to be able to walk away from this job with my head held up, instead of down.  But I do need to walk away, and I can't do that until I have another job.  Anyways....

      So I'm listening to a cheesy song.  Well that's what I'm doing now.  Before I was reading the great book I got for Christmas; 'At Swim, Two Boys' by Jaimie O'Neill.  It's a hard read for me, not just because there seem to be so many words that I don't understand.  But moreso on my own psyche it's pretty difficult.  If the end of the book isn't what I'm hoping it will be I'll be very upset.  And the other main thing that bothers me, is that the book is so romantic and beautiful, and it makes me realise that I have never experienced anything of the sort in my life.  And I really don't expect I ever will.  Now if I were to play the blame game, I would probably place my wish to fall in love and have a great romance on my friend Natalie.  Sorry, N-Babe...I'm not saying this is a bad thing but I wonder sometimes if I would actually be bothered by loves abscence if it weren't for the queen of romance herself.  As I have alluded to before I consider myself to be a big ole puzzle.  The big piece in the middle that is missing is my love and my soulmate, and everything will fall into place around that if only I could find it.  And yet, it doesn't seem like it will fit perfectly even if I do find it.  On top of this stuff a customer called me ugly today.  On top of that I made a couple of judgement errors Friday night, so now I am left desperately trying to hold onto any remnant of positive mood.  As anyone knows nothing quite bothers me like making a mistake.  Ugly??  Imagine that, eh.  I mean, I think I'm unattractive, but ugly my be a tad harsh.  Certainly if you go more than skin deep I might be construed as being ugly.  Mind you in that sense I could also be construed as being beautiful.  I am nothing if not empathetic, I try my best and sometimes how much I care for others can affect me negatively.  In case any of you wonder why I don't show my empathy much that would be why.  But when it comes to myself I don't allow much 'self-pathy'.  I'm not sure if there is a word for empathy of the self.  I don't give myself a break.  I care very little for myself and my value.  In fact I value myself alot less than I am sure most of you would begin to think I do.  So you ask the question, am I depressed?  I would say no.  This is the way I live my life, constantly in this purgatorey of mood, I am neither here nor there but I am more likely to fall then to ascend.  So it goes.

      Dammed Fry, I can't teach.  I'm a Professor.  That about sums up the University experience right there doesn't it?  Don't get me wrong.  I have had some very good professors, but, I have also had a couple that have no business in a job that pays well over 70,000.  If you want to know why tuition is so high why don't you take a look at what your school is spending money on and quit looking for money the Government not only doesn't have, but realistically doesn't need to be giving to schools in the first place.  Say what, you say.  Government gives money to universities more as a courtesy.  The Government knows that this is where the next batch of workers come from and we want a well educated work force not only for domestic reasons but also to improve ourselves on the world stage.  Every university in Canada is in effect, a private organization.  And thusly, should not technically be given public money.  Obviously for the greater good they are given money, which is fine.  But I really think that if you want tuition costs to freeze or go down there is nothing the Government can do to help.  They have enough things to poor money into.  You know like sponsorship and things.  I'll make that point now before anyone gets all high and mighty on me.  And another thing.  What's the big fucking deal about that??  This is hardly the first time that tax payer money has been used for inappropriate things.  I'm willing to bed that almost every Government since Confederation has lost money somewhere.  Are we going to collect from the corpse of Sir Wilfrid Laurier?  Probably not.  A Government is a large institution.  All the more reason why it should be downsized.  Hello Senator *glock glock*...See you in hell you rich do nothing bastard.  How do you like that for downsizing???  Again, please don't get me wrong.  I am upset about this.  But this is part of what living in a Capitalist society is...Business will always be grabbing at the pockets of government, and sometimes they're going to get something.  I find it hard to be outraged.  I would rather have my Government misuse 150 million dollars, then misuse billions.  You know what I'm talking about.  *Cough cough* war in Iraq *cough cough*.  Well that's enough ranting...And I didn't even talk about anything personal.  Not that there's much to say.  I mean...Considering how pathetic I view myself to be, no wonder nobody ever gives credence to my opinions.  As true as they may be.

      I am supposed to go to lunch with my friend Michelle today...Well it's technically Sunday at 2:55am...Later today.  I mean, I will go to lunch with her I forget when she said she was going to call though so I'll have to get up and get ready around noon.  No sleeping in for me, plus I have to come home to put the ham in the oven.  Some of few are probably snickering at that.  Get your minds out of the gutter you perverts!!!  Someone wrote to me; "Happy VD Dane".  To which I reply, "Happy Venerial Disease what the hell kind of friend are you?  You know I'm very sensitive about my STD's."  I know it's a bad joke.  I don't have any STD's for the record.  I don't know what I want to write about.  I am surprisingly stunned by something I was watching on TV.  And despite the obvious social message it is delivering I think I was more affected by how useless the teenage girl was.  I mean, she enters into a competition where you have to kill the other contestants but she does jack shit besides get beaten to death by an old man.  Jeez.  Pathetic.  And yet very disturbing because her family and boyfriend watched it happen.  It was called "Series 7" or something to that affect.  Anyways interesting....I also caught the tale end of John Carpenter's "Ghosts of Mars".  That was much less interesting.  So..."Fellow" has reappeared on my MSN list.  I suppose he's expecting me to be all excited and message away.  I don't think I'll do that.  Don't get me wrong, I do really want to talk to him and everything.  But I want to know if he actually wants to talk to me.  The only vibe I ever got from him was that he was using me for something and didn't really give a shit about me.  And the fact that he would ignore me over so small a thing really points to him just needing any excuse to remove me from his life.  As if moving to another province wouldn't do it??  Anyways...I the I am going to go listen to ABBA or something.  Ain't got nothin' better to do until the morning comes.

      You know it's a week since the last entry and although there were lots of ups in the past week I am right back to where I was.  It is an inevitability of being me I guess, I'll always come full circle, especially where the circles origin is negative feeling.  I'm not making any sense.  Sometimes I get the feeling that I never do, my way of thinking doesn't seem to fit within the reality of the world that we actually exist in.  Not to mention the people who inhabit said world.  I care but I don't.  I'm not sure whether to think of it as apathy, or as a form of hypocrisy.  I want to be better, to get better.  But I am either unwilling or incapable of making necessary changes.  Malaise forever.  I went to bed last night at...hmmm...I'd say 3:30am, although didn't fall asleep until 5 at least.  And despite getting up for a couple bathroom breaks, and missing 2 appointments in the process I stayed in bed until 6pm.  Really I didn't even want to get up then.  I didn't feel bad or anything until after this...That's the problem.  I hate it when I stay in bed all day, but I still don't get up.  And negative feelings are an unavoidable result of this.  It's the same as when I have a one night stand, or brief relationship, I know I'm going to feel guilty afterward but I do it anyway.  Do I really hate myself that much?  I guess I would have to say I do.  Although I'm not sure what I did to deserve the hatred.  Maybe it's more things I haven't done, or that I should have done.  A lot of my self-deprecation is to keep people at a distance.  It doesn't work most of the time, it just makes people more interested in me.  At least it roots out all the shallow people.  Right now there are three people who are interested in me in some way.  Two are in the navy, one of whom is out at sea the other who is French-Canadian.  The other is a cute Taiwanese student at Acadia.  Now as of right now, I am not interested in any of these people.  I'm not even sure if I want to be friends with any of them.  Two of them seem a little needy, and the other one seems like a whore.  Two I would have problems communicating with, and two likely lack the kind of intelligence I require in a person.  Such is that situation.  We'll see how it plays out I guess.  I still miss "fellow".  He still isn't talking to me, but I guess it's really showing me what kind of person he is.  Which is "not a very good one", as sad as that is to say.

      How pathetic do I feel right now?  Well I don't have an answer for that but certainly I am feeling about the apex of patheticness at the moment.  I got up this morning...key word is morning...but after eating breakfast, I was cold and got under the covers once again and slept until 4.  How absolutely wonderful it is to sleep for so long and to never accomplish anything.  It's almost like my life, with the exception that in most of my life I have been awake when I don't accomplish anything.  And while I'm in this mood I may as well go on about my new theory of how my Dad likes my sisters boyfriend more than he likes me.  I am not saying love here...love is unconditional I know he loves me.  But on Sunday he didn't ask anyone if they wanted more garlic bread, there were three pieces left and he brought them all down and gave one to my sister, one to her boyfriend and the other for himself.  I realise it was just the mood I was in that day but it really bothered me.  He didn't even ask me if I wanted it.  And I did want it too.  Then it seems like I just get looks...and I know what they (my parents) must be thinking, I mean, I've been back for 4 days and haven't done jack shit.  I mean yes my back hurts but that's no excuse to spend the bulk of my time sleeping.  But somehow I need to get the idea of my head that I can hide from the world while sleeping.  Really that's what it's all about is hiding.  When I'm asleep I don't have to think of any of the things that plague me during my waking hours.  It was bascially a guaruntee that I would become depressed after moving.  In the period of adjustment there is always that weakening of my mind and will.  But I really don't want this to happen, I have so many things that need to get done around here...well not just around here, I have alot of stuff that needs to get done.  But the only things I have any attention span for are sleeping and staring at the tv...now that's pathetic!

      Well there's two things I suppose I need to talk about.  My apologies for no updating of late but I've had to move and all that crap.  So first thing...."fellow" is still not talking to me.  And although he's explained why I can't help but be frustrated.  I don't think he understands how hurt I am over the whole thing.  I feel awful for saying something I didn't mean, and I realise I pretty much brought it on myself but we should be able to work it out.  I am sick of coming online for the sole purpose of hoping he'll talk to me.  I wouldn't be going on gay.com at all if it weren't for this situation, I am quite tired of that room and all that goes with it.  *Sigh*...all I want is to be friends again...or to make him understand that I really care about him.  But that seems so hopeless.  Second the first boy I had a crush on story.  I'll mention this person by name because the chances of them reading it are slim, and even if he did I would hope he would be flattered as opposed to offended.  So yes...it has been 10 years plus since the last time I had seen him, as a rather small blonde haired, green eyed boy.  Tyler Field is his name.  We played basketball together one year, and I so desperately wanted to make sure he played again the next year that I managed to get his phone number and call him a couple days before registration.  His eyes are as close to perfection as I could imagine, that's really where the appeal is.  Don't get me wrong, he's a good looking guy, but they eyes are distinguishing.  I so wanted to be his friend, to hang out with him....just to be around him...and yes I always hoped he was on the skins team in the scrimmage.  So I ran into him at the store....and I looked into his eyes, and was taken back to that time.  A time of awakening I suppose.  Desire awakes, and the mind flourishes with thoughts of romance, love and the ever elusive happiness.  There's a part of me that really wants to ask him if he'd like to hang out sometime...realising he isn't gay...I don't want to go on a date.  But I always thought he and I could be good friends, and I didn't sieze the opportunity back then.    Such are things in this crazy mixed up world.  My back hurts, I miss "fellow", and I love that boy who first brought out my gay self.

      Some one explain to me what the hell just happened.  I was innocently searching for jobs, when all of a sudded the life was sucked out of me.  I have been in a good mood.  But it has floated away, as though it was only a vestige that had briefly taken refuge within my mind.  I need to get a new job, or a second job.  But what am I going to get.  I am not qualified for anything really, and potential employers don't look at how capable you are to do a certain job.  I like that sentence because at least it implies I do believe I am capable of something.  I try so hard to be able to help others through their insecurities.  It's hard for me to do it, having plenty of my own to deal with.  But that gives me a good insight on what other people have to work with.  Which is why I can safely tell people to pull their heads out of their asses and smell the fresh air.  Guess what folks??  You've got talents.  How unfortunate for you that you can't live in this dream world where you are useless, and going nowhere.  That world doesn't exist.  You live in the real world.  Where if you wanted to accomplish something, you have the tools to do it.  But of course, you'll never believe what I say.  You'll just continue to make small obstacles into gigantic life movement blocking structures of complacency.  And I know what you're thinking...I'm a big fucking ass hypocrite for saying all this shit about others and not myself.  Well guess what??  I love my friends and family...but they don't see the things that are lacking in me.  And there are many many things.  I don't possess the life skills to go far, not right now anyway.  I have no skills to get another job that is better than what I have.  And even if I did, I likely don't have the dedication to do it.  I don't want any of you to think you are being singled out here.  Over the past few days I have had similar conversations with at least 4 people.  With talk of "lack of accomplishment" etc.  Well what you define as accomplishment and what others may see you have accomplished are two different things.  Personally I feel that anyone I know who has fallen in love, regardless of whether they fell out of it has accomplished a great deal.  It is certainly more than I have done.  To me the idea of making over 20,000 dollars a year is a pipe dream.  I'll always say that I don't want to argue about who has the worst issues.  I am working on mine, and I feel that if you have similar issues you need to work on them.  The sooner the better, hopefully before you get to the point where I am.  Which is essentially my last ditch effort to save myself.  Well i think I have gone on long enough and not really done much except possibly offend some friends.  Which is never my intention.  Nor do I wish to make them think they can't talk to me about these things.  You really can.  I am a good friend, or at least I try to be.  It's about the only thing that I do try to do well.

      It's been a while since I have posted anything.  I am not sure why that is.  Who wants to read what's on my mind anyways?  I know I don't.  It is always fun trying to live your life resgined to the fact that you can never be anything.  I always see people I know my Dad knows...and would love to say, hello I am Rick Butler's son.  But I don't, and not because I am not proud of my father.  But rather, because I don't want people to lose respect for him because I am the son he had.  Let's face it, I am pretty emberassing.  I have little education, I work a part-time job that I will get fired from more likely than get promoted.  I sleep 12 hours a day, I have no self-esteem and seem hell bent on making sure I never get any.  And I can't change.  What is more pathetic than a lack of ability to change and adapt.    My counsellor doesn't agree with this assesment, but that's easy for someone with an MSW to say.  Living your life just because you love people enough to realise they might miss you if you weren't around is very tiresome.  It really is a good thing I don't take my own feelings into account much because lord knows if I did I would probably be picked out of the harbour by a net and a pool skewer.  I mean really if you look at what I am good at.......the only things I am good at are having no self-esteem, and being pathetic.  Well three cheers for me on accomplishing that much.  Otherwise I seem always to be caught in the in between:  I am too ugly to be attractive, but I am too attractive to be ugly I am to intelligent to be stupid, but I am too stupid to be intelligent I am too straight to be gay, but I am too gay to be straight I am too good to be bad, but I am too bad to be good  I could do that all night but what's the point really...it's not like I am making any sense.  I'm sure many people just think I am being self-depricating for the sake of it.  Alas, no.  For I am self-deprication incarnate, no compliment can pass my walls to attack my self-image.  Pleasant thoughts must be purged forever lest they create a stable mental environment.

      Get this people I was actually in bed tonight before 1am.  And I don't work tomorrow until 4pm.  That's a rather odd thing to happen.  Of course now it's 1:45am and I have come in here to write and entry on ye ole blog.  Aside from it being Sunday, which seems to be my main update day.  I suppose I was prompted by a couple of things I was reading in bed.  I was reading my book "Disturbance" by Jaimie O'Neill, who also wrote "At Swim, Two Boys" which I can't possibly rave about enough.  The other was a letter I came accross on a day where I actually unpacked a little.  I found it a while ago but haven't bothered to read it.  I know what it says.  I suppose I didn't want to read it due to how utterly complimentary toward me it is.  And as we know I am not a huge fan of a compliment directed at me.  The letter I recieved last year as a result of the writing I did for the school paper at MSVU.  Sure the guy is probably a crack-pot.  That certainly remains my opinion.  Especially considering his high praise for someone whose grammar skills are  elementary school level at best.  However at the heart of it is the real question.  Am I a good writer??  Aside from my poor grammar of course.  Could I become a good writer??  What would I write about??  What is my voice??  My cat Agatha just spontaneously looked up at me and now wants pets.  I often wonder about animals and the way they read me.  Especially after a certain incident with my now deceased cat Spooky that happened a few years back.  Animals just seem to have that sense.  Truly amazing if you think about it.  Anyhow I have lost focus on this.  I am not sure if any of the questions above are meant as anything besides rhetorical.  But if you feel like answering I'll listen.   urlLink   That's me...although perhaps I will take up this offer to try out the google mail.  Tell me if I should do that too.

      Another day, another failure.  Does it matter what the failure was?  At this stage of my life I doubt it matters much.  Just add it to the pile.  Anyhow, on an entirely different note...I caught a very odd thing tonight.  On the Family Channel starting at 11:50pm was a program I have not seen in years.  In fact I am the only person I know who even remembers it.  It's called Earth Star Voyager, it was made around 1987 or so and doesn't really star anyone you may have heard of.  I am certain it was the pilot for a show that never got picked up, and was just released as cheap network filler material.  As I recall it had aired on ABC and/or CBC during the Wonderful World of Disney.  Is it cheap??  Oh yes.  Is it cheesy??  Beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Does it remind me of good memories??  Indeed.  I pretty much was raised by TV.  That was more of a voluntary thing.  Trust me my parents certainly tried to get me away from it.  And for many years succeeded.  I only had vague recollections of this thing.  I knew if I ever saw it again it would be horribly lame, which it is.  Although it does have some redeeming qualities.  But oh, how I wanted to the child genious character....and oh how cute I thought he was.  And for the record at the time this show originally aired that actor was probably older than I was.  Oh how I wanted to travel the galaxy to find a new home for our civilization.  I guess that's feeling that was brought out later on again by other space epics, like Star Trek and Star Wars.  I called my friends Adam and Laura as soon as I discovered it was on.  They were off watching Kill Bill 2 so I left a silly message as I am apt to do.  Here's hoping they watched a little of it.  Just so someone knows what the hell I am talking about.  Incidentally Kill Bill 2...excellent...I could say more but it seems moot.  Chances are if you're someone that knows me or finds me at all interesting then you already know how good it is and don't need me to give a more detailed opinion.  That's all for now.  Let's see what this week brings.

      As Nat said, "this blog is far too self-depricating".  Well that it is my friends.  Which never seems to be my intention, but does always seem to be the result.  So is this one going to be different?  Not as far as I know.  But we'll see how it ends shall we?  One of the reasons I guess I have been so slack when it comes to unpacking is as follows;  I don't like to be reminded of what my life is.  Or for that matter who I am.  I don't like to be reminded of my uselessness.  Even though I go to bed every night and tell myself I am useless regardless.  So I know, if I feel I am unaccomplished I should go out and do somethign about it.  Well, things are not that easy.  Or maybe they are.  It's not like I have tried anything.  I realise this Blog tends to get more personal than I ever meant it to be.  I suppose that's because I have a hard time talking about this stuff with even my best friends face to face.  Not that I necessarily want to.  But at least this way if you want to know the inner workings of my mind you may occasionally catch a glimpse.  It's hardly Babylon I know.  If only the things that other people saw in me were actually there.  What a person that would make me.  But nobody can live life in "if only's".  "If Only's" are basically regrets.  But also, in a way, we all need to have our regrets.  Do I ever make any sense???  Am I even capable of making sense???  Can I ever use less than three question marks???

      It is a shame I am not a teacher, for there are so many lessons people need to learn.  I sometimes wonder if most people comprehend the gravity of the word 'genocide'.  As I recall nobody leaped to Rwanda to stop all the killing.  In fact well over 500'000 were killed before anyone batted an eye lash.  I mean the people who were being killed no doubt batted their eyelashes right before they were hacked to death with a machete.  Where was the outrage???  It is 10 years later, and we honor the memory.  Which is good.  We should never forget.  But I have had people tell me they didn't realise how big a deal it was.  Granted at the time I don't think I did either.  I did learn much sooner than now, however.  Does nobody comprehend that over one million people were senselessly butchered???  Now we have the most powerful nation in the world hunting down those for killing 2000 people.  It's a shame not all people are allowed that kind of justice.  Actually, forget shame.  It's not fair.  Of course life is not fair.  That may even be the meaning of life, at least for some.  Bah!  I lost my train of thought.  Which happens all too often and explains why I can talk big but can't back it up.  Thoughts are one thing, and actions are another.  Although it is true that words can be powerful.  It will take a lot more than I am capable of to make people care...to make people see.

      Our weaknesses are as much a part of us as our strengths.  We all have the ability to be fragile as glass, and yet solid as granite.  I am just realising that my last post is gone.  I wonder why that is?  There are few updates to give of course.  I officially am the heaviest I have ever been.  Will this prompt me to change the way I eat and live my life?  Probably not.  It really should, but it won't.  I have finally started talking to "fellow" again.  I am looking for jobs.  Wish me luck, because my unqualified ass is going to need it.  I have met a couple of interesting people.  But it's not like that interaction makes me feel any better about things or myself.  And it's not like I am meeting people who even live in the same city as me.  My friend Jay moved to Toronto this past Friday.  Good for him is all I can say, and I wish him the best of luck.  He has joined both the gay soccer, and basketball leagues there.  You want to talk about things that make me jealous.  Ah well, I'm too fat to play sports now....Six foot one and 185...I may as well be a derelict, stuck in a hammock all the long day with five fans around me cooling the air and spreading my foul stench throughout my trailer in Eastern Passage.  I hate Sundays.  No matter how good my weeks are, everything always resets.  And then I have to start anew, trying to get the week to go my way.  That is until the next Sunday when it resets and I must begin again.  This is also why I hate the word cyclical.  Well I am going to try to find out what happened to my last entry.  Hopefully I will start updating more than once a week.  And even more hopefully will write something that's not quite so self-centered.

      I'll keep that last entry in mind as I write.  Of course it is very early Saturday morning now...umm 1:22am that is, I have to get up for work in about 4 hours.  Now considering the time of week of course I am feeling fairly positive.  Well, positive for me at least.  That is to say I have no major interest in crawling into a hole to die at the moment.  Hopefully I can make it through the weekend with this mood in tact.  Went to see Shrek 2 tonight with Laura.  Hilarious.  I especially enjoyed the Fairy Godmother doing a ballad version of Bonnie Tyler's 'I need a Hero'.  In fact, I found that so hysterical that I had to grab onto Laura lest my laughter float me off the planet or something.  Apparently I have resorted to clutching to women in times of joviality.  Time to throw out the lube and the boy porn???  Also worth mentioning is that Laura seems to have a rather nice bicep.  What's up with that?  Keep pumpin those guns girl, I'm gonna buy that heavy bag eventually.  Keep pumpin' those guns girl???  What the hell am I saying.  I think there was something weird in that Cinnabon I ate.

      Well it is Sunday.  Or at least it was.  It is after midnight so I guess that makes it Monday.  Regardless, it is Sunday so we can all guess what kind of mood I'm in.  You'd think I would be able to get over this whole "life is pointless" thing by now.  How did I ever end up this way?  If poor self-image and depression were strictly the result of environment then I probably wouldn't be in this state.  I  think it really comes down to letting go.  Letting go of negative thoughts, memories, traits and images.  That's easier said than done of course.  But I still let things that happened when I was 3 years old bother me.  You know, I kick and I scratch and I fight everyday to take some semblence of positivity away.  And yet at the end of the week it is inevitably lost to some unknown force that seems hell bent on ruining me.  Then again, perhaps it is not so unknown.  I would dare say it's me.  It has always been me sabotaging my own efforts to improve and progress.  I also don't understand why I always make entries like this one.  Yeesh.  You'd think I could write something light hearted and fancy free for once.  I am capable of that with some effort.  When did this become a tome to my self-loathing???  Time to go to bed, hopefully to not ponder any further questions of major severity.  Wishful thinking I imagine.

      Oh lord what am I doing up???  I have to get up for work in three hours.  I was just laying in bed with a million thoughts coming to me, many of them surprisingly clever.  Mainly focusing on an idea for a book I had with a title along the lines of "Opinions that don't matter: A guide on how not to think."  Which would essentially be a book of some of my opinions and theories.  Most of which many people don't know.  It is this laying in bed and thinking that has made me realise that someone should invent software that will take the thoughts I am thinking and transfer them to the computer.  I am so much more clever when simply thinking as opposed to speaking or writing.  Everything is so much more cohesive in my head.  Well, at least in terms of certain things.  Well I guess it's time to try sleeping again.  One more day of work to face then a day off.  Which of course is Sunday, traditionally my worst day of the week.  Marvellous.  But you never know how this week will be.  We'll see how it goes.

      I have been playing around with the features on this thing.  Here's hoping I didn't somehow wipe out my whole history.  Mind you would that really be any big loss.  It's not like I'm changing the world here.  The argument that this provides some form of catharsis for me is also a rather specious one.  I'm not even sure what I want to write about.  This week does not seem to be going my way, for whatever reason.  Mind you my state of mind is akin to a porcelain vaise on a thin table in the middle of a huge party.  ie; it's very precarious.  Prescription drugs or no, I still seem to be tottering between positive lucidity and my always popular frigid dark of complacency.  Hmmm I like that...frigid dark of complacency.  I'm goint to remember that one.  I'm at a loss right now.  Ummm...well I finally finished my handwritten journal.  It took me long enough.  It was started in November 2000 for chrissake, but I took a few long lay offs from it.  Still it's interesting to read back on some of that stuff.  Now I just need to fill up the other 3, or is it 4 books i have waiting in the wings.  Mind you, I can still remember the emotions around many of those entries.  Any entry involving say...the name Trevor tends to make me very angry.  Entries involving Christmas tend to brighten my perspective.  The end of a year entries make me feel hopeless.  The really old entries cause me to reminiss (sp?).  It's odd how for some reason I want to be locked back into the time of living in the crack house.  For those of you who don't know, the crack house was just the run down place that was my first apartment.  I do miss those days.  I even have CD's that remind me specifically of that time in my life.  It's not that I'm living in the past per say.  More like I am not willing to let go of that time, those people, and those experiences.  I guess that's pretty pathetic.  Pathetic might be a bit harsh.  But as we all know I don't really give myself breaks.  Especially since I don't deserve them.  Ho ho ho I'm not in a good frame of mind right now.  That means it's time for bed.

      Well tonight was speed dating.  As you may recall that was supposed to happen back in April but didn't due to lack of interested parties.  This time around there were enough people signed up, but very few came.  Five to be precise.  So needless to say it didn't go ahead, but I did sit with these people and talked for a few hours.  I had a good time.  Plus the goal was accomplished; That being the going out and meeting strangers in a public setting.  Take that social anxiety!!  Although my somewhat lack of social skill did allow me to make a fool of myself a couple times.  Or so I believe.  I didn't mean to talk as much, or as openly about myself as I did.  Oh well I can't take it back so there's no point dwelling on that.  I also won a coupon for a free brunch at Vortex.  I believe I will enjoy that.  There is a display of art there by Trevor VanDen...ummm....spelling this wrong but here goes....VanDeneiyden...I don't think I'm even close.  Very interesting pictures, some including hot boys, and one including  "fellow" as he is referred to in this blog.  For those who don't know "fellow" is the last person I dated for any amount of time, and I am still left with some unresolved feelings over the whole situation.  The picture makes me smile.  I wish it didn't but it does.  I was always smiling when I looked at him.  Oh well.  So now I end up dating yet another nice guy who doesn't seem to give a shit about me.  But not in a bad way.  More of just an impartial way, as though, it's good that I'm there.  But it wouldn't make a lot of difference if I weren't.  My priorities are all wrong I know.  I don't know why I feel this need to be in a relationship.  Or why I seem to think it is the link in the chain of my life that is keeping everything from coming together.  Wow that metaphor was terrible.  The one thing I have always wanted is to stay up all night talking to someone...just talking...perhaps walking on the waterfront when it's later, and quiet.  I've never really done that with anyone.  Well I walked along the waterfront with that professor from SMU that time, but there was no relationship like intent there.  But i have definately never stayed up all night talking to a guy about life, or even generic things like music or movies or what have you.  I don't want to work tomorrow.  And I have this rather strange pain in my right pectoral area...I'm not sure what's causing it.  Perhaps it will flare up and I'll have to go home early.  I'm not sure why I'm hoping for such a selfish thing.  I suppose because it's much more likely that I will be injured and sent home from work then something more selfless, like world peace.  World peace???  Talk about pipe dreams.  Alright enough rambling for now.  I guess I am trying to make up for a lack of updates with a long entry.  Well if you read it, then good for you.  Your attention span is much higher than mine.

      Let's play a little game shall we?  I have been making tallies of a couple of different things over the past few days at work.  Your job will be to guess the acromym for what I have been observing.  I am not giving any hints right now.  However you can ask for one through email, or post a message.  However you must ask it in a form such as "are any of the words not english?" or something to that affect.  It's sort of a Front Page challenge thing.  The first 2 days I only did the 1st group the OGG.  So here are the stats.  Fri. shift: 4pm-12 OGG=17  Sat. shift: 11-5 OGG=34  Mon. shift 3-12 OGG=30                 GLB=61  Wed. shift 630am-12 OGG=1                     GLB=14  Thurs. shift 10-5 OGG=15                   GLB=32  Now I will say this much; The two groups can potentially relate, and the may be counted in more than one category.  Meaning that when I tally something as an OGG, I may also tally it as a GLB although that's only happened a couple times.  Notice that the time of day also has an affect on the stats, and that Saturdays number of OGG's was highest.  So...guess the acromym, play along, it'll be fun :) For me at least.  And I deserve a bit of fun.  email is joes_mon@hotmail.com by the way, if you don't have it.

      So after I got off work tonight I ended up getting bugged big time to go out with some current and former coworkers.  Now don't get me wrong, I love these people.  That was why I agreed to visit them on my way home.  But if I say I'm not going to go out, then I'm not going to go out and trying "estrogenically whine" me into it won't work.  But I still love you all.  What else is going on?  Ummmm, nothing.  Well...Euro 2004 has started, and I've been watching as many games as I can.  This is a soccer(football) tournament for those of you who aren't in the know.  The other thing I have been doing is reading the Harry Potter books.  I have just started the 3rd one "The Prisoner of Azkaban".  I won't be giving reviews on it, I'm simply mentioning it as something of interest.  And trust me, when it comes to me actually being able to read something all the way through it is something worth mentioning.  I really have nothing interesting to say right now.  I should be changing so many things but I still don't seem to want to do it.  I weighed myself again, which was a big mistake.  Of course I can't complain because I know I am willingly doing this to myself, and also that I do have a gym membership and could nip this decline in the bud if that were my wish.  It is my wish.  But I also wish to be fat and ugly, so at least I have a tangible reason for the fact nobody wants me.  I'm doing pretty good on that end.  190lbs.  You may not think that's much, I am 6'1"...however I am now officially well overweight, and I am now 10lbs over the heaviest I have previously been, ie: 180 back in late April.  For one of the first times in my life I really feel as though there are some good options open to me.  The catch is that right now I don't seem very interested in pursuing any of those options.  I could move cities, I could move out again, I could just go visit some people, I could quite my job, I could visit Europe, I could go back to school, I could take teach english overseas classes and do that.  There's more to that list too, I could write, I could take singing lessons, I could learn how to play the guitar.  Many of those aren't life options, but they all are within my current means to do.  So what will I choose?  Knowing me, I will choose?  Knowing me I will choose complaicency and all of these opportunities will pass without being given any due thought.

      Let's see now, what time is it?  Ah yes, 4:42pm, and I have been out of bed now for about, well 42 minutes.  I have got to do something about these destructive sleeping habits.  Of course I say that, but I'm not actually going to so I suppose it's a moot point.  It is not like there's anything terribly interesting going on at night.  I usually just sit at the computer, hang out in the chat room, surf around.  Not very exciting stuff.  I really should hang out in the tv room and watch Conan, I haven't watched him in a long time.  I need to finish getting ready so I can go meet up with Laura.  I feel bad because I am not in the mood to spend time outside, and that's what she wants to do.  If it were cloudy and dank I'd be all for it.  I'm not one of those people who gets all cheerful and empowered over the sunshine and warmth.  As usual I am the opposite.  I don't like being outside under the sun and the blue sky anymore, because it is beautiful, and I am not.

      I would like to start this blog by pointing out that my friend Laura is not nearly as bad a speller as she appeared to be in the comment she left after my last entry.  In fact she is intelligent, beautiful, and all other nice things you could ever say about one person.  Having said that however, let me add this special note to her: "Seriously were you drunk or something when you wrote that???  I think we need to have an intervention."  Ahem...so yes...I have invented a few terms in my day.  Wait, did I talk about "Queek" already???  I can't remember if I did.  That is the term referring to a queer geek of course.  Which thusly is a term I can use to refer to myself.    So it was just Sunday, and I'm not in an utterly terrible mood.  Although I was a while ago, and there's no telling how I'll feel when I go to bed and the sound of my brain kicks in.  Damn brain.  I believe that my own thoughts drive me nuts, but if I tried to share these thoughts, or if someone were reading my mind all they would hear is "AFLAC!!" I'm not actually sure what that joke implies or if it's even funny.  Well I tried at least.  I think it's about time I went to bed.  It's another week.  More potential for change.  More likelihood things will stay very much the same.

      I don't know where to start.  Not that anything of major interest is going on.  Rather, it is simply because I am at a loss as to what to talk about.    Tonight was the 3rd Speed Dating event I have gone to.  It is also the 3rd Speed Dating event I have gone to that did not happen.  It's starting to piss me off.  I'm trying to put myself out there at least.  Apparently the all women event was full and was a big success.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  Gay men suck, and not just 'that' way you dirty dirty people.  It's not like I am expecting to find 'the one' at these events.  Hopefully I could meet someone I would at least be willing to hang out with now and then.  It has been a long time since I have had a friend of the same persuasion to hang out with.  I miss Zack a lot.  And yet I make very little effort to spend any time with him.  There are others who have offered, and although I am interested I seem to resist.  I don't know why.  Maybe I'm afraid of gay people or something.  The one thing that does piss me off about the speed dating is as follows; It take a great deal of effort to make myself look presentable.  But it ends up that there was no reason to put forth the effort.  And whoever says that it's not important how you look on the outside, it's the kind of person you are on the inside, was obviously not a gay man.  I know it sounds cynical.  It is cynical, but this also applies to me.  I have met some very nice people, who would probably be good to date, you know...if I actually found them attractive at all.  I truly believe that most people are inherently superficial.  Unless of course they are completely ugly, in which case they don't feel the need to judge others, those lucky ducks.  That paragraph makes me sound like a bad person.  If you know me, that means you know that I often am attracted to men who are not conventionally good looking.  This is where the "geek quotient" applies.  That being an equation that measures the appeal of a man or woman based on their geeky attributes.  Geekiness is totally sexy.  Nerdiness on the otherhand is highly unfortunate.  And dweebiness....puhleeze.  As for spaz...well they usually have big dicks but otherwise not attractive.  Somewhere along my way I have lost my train of thought.  Maybe my train of thought was big dicks all along.  That would be rather odd, as I am certainly not a size queen.  I have a feeling I'll be editing some stuff out of this post tomorrow.  But until then.......See what a big freak I am ;)

      So here I am at last to update my blog; And despite the fact that it has been weeks since I have posted anything I've got nothing to say really.&nbsp; I promised myself that I wouldn't simply write about how much I hate myself, and life...but without that fodder I'm left with very little.&nbsp; At least when you consider that I will turn any topic into how much I hate life and myself.&nbsp; It is inevitable.  So yeah, there's nothing to say then.&nbsp; I asked for 2 weeks off work and that time has officially started as I just returned from my final pre-vacation shift.&nbsp; Ummmm....Go see the movie Napolean Dynamite.  This is all I've got for now.&nbsp; I'm not in a very clever mood so there's no way for me to come up with anything good to put in..........  My name is Shake-zula the mic rulah the old schoola!

      I'm not sure where my last post went.  The site doesn't seem to have updated.  Perhaps they are just behind or something.  Not that you're missing anything if it doesn't get posted.  I've got nothing to say.  I actually met someone new.  Which of course is quite a feat for me.  But naturally I have my hopes a little too high as to what may happen with it.  But I digress.  It's my own fault I feel so inadequate compared to other people; That I feel so unworthy.  It is this attitude that I need to change, because I'll never be happy unless I figure out a way to do it.    Sometimes perhaps I place too much emphasis on the feeling I get when I look into someones eyes.  However I really do believe that in most cases I can tell if there's a connection with a person through eye contact, coupled of course with some other factors.  I don't know what on earth I'm talking about, or what I even want to say.  God I just wish I could get my head together.  I just wish I could be the person, be the things that, at least in an alternate universe I am capable of being.  I know I've got potential.  But potential is nothing.  Potential doesn't bring happiness.

      It's about time I posted something isn't it?  I don't really have anything to say.  I've finished reading the Harry Potter books.  So now I, like millions of others, must wait until the next one comes out.  I met someone knew tonight.  Someone from online obviously.  Had a good time blah blah blah.  I don't put much hope into anything coming out of it.  He's too attractive for me and I think he knows it.  Plus I made myself sound like a total dumbass, which is something I tend to do when I meet people who are of equal if not superior intelligence.  So he's got brains and he's got looks, he'll make someone very happy and maybe we'll be friends or something.  Who knows what the future holds?  I really don't know what to write.  I never intend to make entries about my negative feelings.  But it seems that as soon as I sit down to write and entry I'm completely flooded with negative thoughts.  All the things that happen to me in the run of the day and at the end I always feel the same.  Now this would be a good thing of course if I went to bed happy and satisfied.  But that's not the case, and I can't see it ever becoming so.  Ooooh I got home in time to catch Harvey Birdman and Aqua Teen Hunger Force....jesss!!!!

      I feel funny.  Likely owing to the fact that I have yet to eat today.  My parents always ask me whether or not I have eaten.  As though I am not eating or something.  I eat plenty, and plenty of the wrong food while I'm at it.  If they are wondering if I'm eating then all one would have to do is look at me as I leave the bathroom after my shower with the towel on.  Then you can see how utterly 'jiggle-rific' I have become.  There's yet another term that I have made up.  I shall add it to the Dane dictionary.  I believe I am up to a whole page now.  So this week I have been on vacation.  I was also supposed to be on vacation this week however I agreed to work on Tuesday and Wednesday because they needed people.  I had forgotten that Tuesday was my birthday, but I'm off at 4 so it really makes no difference.  Usually there's a big birthday dinner.  That's what my parents do for us kids...take us out to dinner.  We don't give presents in my family, just cards and dinner.  I like this arrangement.  I am a much bigger fan of food than I am of sweaters that don't fit properly.  This year however I really don't want to have anything.  Mind you I'm pretty sure I feel this way every year, and my parents usually get me to do it anyway.  This year I probably could have convinced them not to do anything...However my cousin whose birthday is August 12th is in town and so the families want to have a one night two birthday thing, and I can't very well say no to that.  If you're wondering why I don't want to celebrate my birthday I'll run down as many reasons as I can.  Although my head is sort of swimming with lack of sustinence I can try.  I don't like getting older of course, that's everyone's generic reason.  Another year lacking accomplishment, lacking improvement, lacking my self you could even say.  I also hate people spending money on me.  I don't feel deserving of it.  Not when the money could go to much better use on either themselves or some charity.  This past year in particular is nothing to celebrate.  The only thing I can really take from it is that I'm still alive.  That is a good thing, that I'm still alive.  However that seems to be all I ever take from any year.  I can never find solace in the fact that I am living.  I have never learned to create my own happiness, and it seems so improbable that I ever will.  So when it comes this time of year it seems that no matter what the coming year will always seem draped in utter futility.

      Have you ever recieved news and for some reason didn't react the way you believed you should have.  It's an odd feeling isn't it.  I was told something today which I suppose I should be angry about but I'm not.  I'm not sure how I'm feeling about it.  So yeah...unfortunately my mood from the weekend has kept me from many things so far this week.  In fact I have done absolutely nothing with my vacation time so far.  In fact I have barely even left the house save for the occasional jaunt out to the deck.  It seems like any control I had over my thoughts or direction has flown away....and I'm waiting for Charleton Heston to show up and shoot it down for me.  Is he even still alive?  The old bastard.  I hate not knowing what to do.  I hate that I've never had any goals.  I hate that I don't know what makes me happy.  Haha...well it seems I've gone back to the ole whining about my mental problems.  It's the old stand by when there's nothing else to talk about since I've shut myself indoors all week.  Which I'm sure is a metaphor for how I handle life...shutting in, never going out...getting carpal tunnel from sitting at the computer too long.  Well, scratch the last one.  Anyways...there's nothing new...continuing along the road of jagged rocks that we call life.  I just wish I could find a pair of shoes.
