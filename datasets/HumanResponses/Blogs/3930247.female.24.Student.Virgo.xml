      Today i woke up as usual at 10:30am. Being lazy is nothing new to me but today i have a strong spell of laziness and sleep over me. Although i am awake, i am just looking for a chance to get under my duvet for a couple of minutes to have a 'tiny' nap. ;) I guess i will do it, but its going to hurt me a bit as i have lots of stuff to do.   I am behind schedule with my disertation. :'( Its not that bad but not that good either. Anyways i will do something. But can somebody tell me how to get rid of all this sleep? ;)  See ya later.   Monazza ;) :D

      Today nothing really happened in my life and i was as lazy as can be. But i saw something on the TV which made my eyes pop out. That something was the person Nick Griffin, leader of the British National Party.   His comments were quoted in news which were 'Islam is a wicked vicious belief'. He also added several other comments to that.   I was so disappointed and sad about this. I was feeling angry at Mr Griffin. But at the same time i was wondering that how can we, the Muslims, portray the real picture of our faith, ISLAM. I think it is partly our fault that we don't show such a character as we should and the true essence of our religion. So people either misunderstand it or just abuse it for the sake of it.   Islam has been abused long enough. It is high time that all of the Muslims should take some action about it. By action i do not mean fighting, but intellectually tackling the problem.   I also want to thank Mr Griffin. Becasue when people like him say such things, my belief in my faith grows even stronger.   See ya all later.   Monazza :)

      Don't think that i am kidding. I litterally did get burnt by ice, or let's say by the freezer.   Actually i was putting some stuff in the freezer, when suddenly my finger got stuck to the ceiling of the fridge. I pulled it but had to exert a lot of pressure to do that. It felt that i had delibrately put some super glue on my finger to stick it there.   Anyways, when i finally got it off, it hurt a bit but i didnt notice anything. But after a while it hurt a bit more. When i saw it, it had a small burnt-like wound on it, all pink and a bit swollen.   So thats how i got 'Burnt by Ice'. ;)

      Some time ago, i was quite unaware that what a 'blog' is. But slowly i have come to know of the power of the blog. I had been lazy to start one of my own. But finally today i gathered all my remaining energies to finally go to blogger.com and make myself a blog.   I don't know exactly what i will be posting here. But one thing is for sure, that it is going to be about me. :D So keep reading and i will promise to keep 'boring' you with my silly tales.   see ya all later.   Monazza ;)

       When I was back home in Pakistan, I used the phrase 'Allah Hafiz' (meaning may God keep you safe) to say bye to people. When I came to UK I was a bit confused about what to say. Every time I would just stop myself from saying 'Allah Hafiz' to people. Not that I didn't want them to be kept safe by God, but it's just that they wouldn't understand what I was saying.     &nbsp;   So I had to choose from one of the phrases already used here. Some would say 'see ya later', some would say just 'Bye'. But I had to mingle the two and choose the phrase 'See ya, Bye' for myself.     &nbsp;   Not that I have any complaints about it, but it becomes really hilarious when I am on the phone. Whenever someone calls I say 'Hi' or 'Hello' which is fine. But when I have to say 'Bye' I act like a fool. I am so used to saying 'see ya bye' that even on the phone to people who are strangers to me I say 'see ya, bye'. I know that I am not going to see them ever, but still that's the thing which comes to my mind to say and I blurt it out. Only after putting down the receiver I realize what I had said.     &nbsp;   But then I cannot undo anything. Already made a fool out of myself I remain a fool. But what I can do is laugh about it, and let the whole world laugh&nbsp;with me too. ;) &nbsp;

       I talked about bhindi so much that I thought I should put everything related to it in my blog. Well the other thing is that I cooked bhindi a day or two ago. I had bought it for many days, but cooking it was actually the attempt to save it from getting rotten in the fridge. ;) [I haven't even started on my fridge bluesyet]  &nbsp;  I cooked them. They looked fine. But they suffered the same dilemma as all my cookings suffer. That is the dilemma of 'too much'. Sometimes it is the salt that is too much, sometimes the red chilies are too much, some times I cook the stuff too much, and this time with the bhindi it was 'too much tomatoes'. So the food tasted more like tomatoes than bhindi. :P I had cooked some turnips a few days before that, and they suffered the same plight.  &nbsp;  I really need to learn when to stop, especially with the tomatoes. ;)

       When I was in Pakistan the English translation for 'bhindi' I knew was ladies fingers. Whenever I was told this translation I was told that since the shape of 'binds' is like&nbsp;ladies fingers so that's why it is given this name. I used to be fascinated by this fact always, and used to think that it has been named rightly.  &nbsp;  Then I came to UK. Here nobody knew about 'ladies fingers'. I was disappointed to see that. 'How can these people not know the name of the vegetable in their own language?', I would say to myself. Then I discovered the word 'ocra' and my life was saved.  &nbsp;  Then I wondered that why in the world we, in Pakistan, still call it 'ladies fingers'. But then we don't call it that. We call it 'Bhindi'. ;)
