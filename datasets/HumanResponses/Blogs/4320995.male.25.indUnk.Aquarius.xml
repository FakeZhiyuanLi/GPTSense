      It is unfathomable to me that he doesn't see that what he did when he came back from Vietnam directly betrayed the very men he served with. He also betrayed all the over 2 million other men that served their country honorably and bravely in Vietnam. Apparently people don't understand that we were not only fighting in Vietnam to help the South Vietnamese people who were being slaughtered daily fight, the North Vietnamese Communists.  People we were fighting against the growing spread of Communism! John Kerry’s hero JFK would have been ashamed of him. JFK knew that the communists needed to be stopped, that why when they put missiles within 100 miles from our country he stood up to them. They knew that he would have sent our nuclear missals right up the asses of everyone in Cuba, and Russia. Unlike JFK, John Kerry is a traitor! In a very direct way, John Kerry helped The Communist North Vietnamese /Russia by accusing all of our military of committing war crimes! John Kerry is Trash!!! How can he honestly say that he didn't know that what he said and did would be used against our American POW's, and would be used to try and break the will of our soldiers, if he couldn’t see that, then he is  urlLink UNFIT FOR COMMAND!

       Here is the deal, 99% of the world is envious of the USA. I guess different people express their feelings in different ways. Take tonight for example, the immature spectators of the men’s High Bar Competition were booing when American  urlLink Paul Hamm  what about to start his routine. He kept his chin, preformed great, and won a silver medal. I am proud of him. Apparently booing Americans is a common thing this year in the Olympics. My question to the world is what is your problem? Does it burn you that we are the greatest country in the world? That we have the more medals, (66 as of 8-23-04) than any other country. Deal with it. We are blessed in this country because we have worked and fought for it. We work harder, we play harder, we move faster, and we live better than any other country in the world. I don't feel guilty about it I embrace it and am proud of my nations heritage. Through our Nations great history, we have never been afraid to stand up for what we believe. Whether it is popular or not. We will fight and we will die for what we believe in. I guess in the end (as far as the Olympics go anyways) all that I really care about is that we beat the China/Cuba and all the other commie bastards who are competing in the Olympics. Oh yeah and France, Germany, and Russia too not because of any other reason than they are a bunch of Bitches...... Peace, BJ
