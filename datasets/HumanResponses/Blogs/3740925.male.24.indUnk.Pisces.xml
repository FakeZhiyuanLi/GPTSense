      I got over my slight hang over.  I spent most of the day chillin at Sam's.  We went swimming.  I got some more sun.  I'm starting to feel better about myself.  I'm excited about the move this weekend.  I need my own place again.  I just hope to God I can get a p/t job soon.  Hollis is driving me nuts and he's not even trying.  He changed and that's fine.  It's my problem for not liking the change.  It's not so much that he's become somewhat hedonistic.  Instead it's that he became hedonistic because he felt the world owed him a good time.  I think that's part of what just rubs me the wrong way about him.  I think he's sick of me too.  I shut out the world when the shit started building up, as I usually do.  I became anti-social.  I'm trying to change that.  I don't know how well our friendship will survive this.  It will get better once we don't live together, but I'm worried it'll never get back to the way it was last summer.  He hangs out with a lot of gay guys apparently.  He finds them amusing or hopes they might be able to advance his career.  I don't like that.  Maybe I'm just an asshole.  Actually, I'm definitely an asshole.  I can't help it.  I treat people in my personal life the way the world has treated me in general.  The world may deserve to be fucked over, but my friends don't.  I lash out at my friends instead of the world because, unlike the world, I can actually lash out and hurt them.  It's sick and disgusting and vile.  I feel bad for whoever winds up falling in love with me.  When I'm happy, I want everyone around me to be happy.  When I'm depressed or angry, I want everyone around me to be depressed and angry.  My love life isn't going to have a happy ending.  On a lighter note, I've come up the next million dollar idea: a massage chair that can give you a happy ending.  I also had a brilliant idea for a skit on SNL: a parody of the scene in PCU where the main character is remembering being roommates with the future head of the college Nazis, only the nerdy young Nazi role would be played by Michael Moore and the wild roommate committing youthful indiscretions would be President Bush; Bush would burst in with a "youthful indiscretion" and a bottle of tequila and Moore would be yelling "Shame on you!  Shame on you for invading my side of the room!"

      Ok, so I wound up going to the parade and to South Beach afterall.  I caved.  It was just easier.  I met up with Aaron and his boy friend Jeff at Aaron's house and then we went to another Jeff's house in Montrose a block from South Beach and JR's.  Montrose Jeff was very nice.  He mixed us some very potent vodka drinks.  I'm still paying for it.  Also, there was a festering squirrel carcass filled with maggots in his front yard.    A bunch of us went to the parade together.  It was a good time.  I really was expecting to see people I knew.  I saw none.  Well, I saw one of the head-chiropractor guys at the Moody Health Center actually.  Maybe his name was Dr. Potts.  Anyway, I was a little disappointed.  We did run into AJ, who I had met the last time I was at South Beach.  Then we went to Katz's so Aaron could get something in his stomach.  At this point his world was spinning.  After Katz's, we went to South Beach.  I was glad to finally get there, but once inside I eventually got depressed.  I felt so alone.  I saw all these kids running around, enjoying freedoms I never did at their age.  I felt like an even bigger chunk of my life had slipped past me.  Dancing on the dance floor, I began to miss Elliott for the first time ever.  For a few hours, Elliott had made me feel normal.  He made me feel like I wasn't an emotionally retarded loser.  I held him and kissed him on the dance floor and all my problems disappeared.  I really missed him.  No one else has ever made me feel like that before.  Tonight, I really had no one to dance with, so I just glanced around the dance floor wondering if I'd run into another Elliott.  I didn't.  I just saw beautiful men who made me hate the way I look.  I'll never be able to deal with a man more attractive than I think I am.  I also don't think I'll ever be able to walk up to a guy and hit on him.  Even when I knew all the men around me were gay, I was paralyzed by the fear that they might not want me to hit on them.  So mostly I just tried to avoid eye contact.  I got back home at about 4 am.  The TV was on very loud and Hollis had clearly been drinking at the apartment and just crawled into his bed to sleep.  I feel bad for not doing something with him tonight.  I thought he had plans.  He always has plans.  For some reason, I really don't want him to be part of my "gay life".  I guess it's mostly a habbit thing.

      I'm half watching Graham Norton's new show on Comedy Central while I'm writing this.  I couldn't think of another name.  It's not very funny so far.  Anyway, I was relatively productive today.  I've been talking to people about the parade tomorrow.  Everyone's telling me it's fun.  I'm not buying it.  I'm at a point where the last thing I need is to be made to feel different.  I don't need my "uniqueness" emphasized.  The very thought is actually making me sick, so I'm going to stop thinking about it.  I'm still going to join my friends at the club afterwards.  I changed the channel.  I love dry British wit.  I'm not really into fart jokes.  My friend Craig is OK after breaking up with his disturbed boy friend AJ.  Apparently, AJ tried to kill himself a few times, checked himself into a mental facility, left, held Craig hostage with a sword for a few hours, then was arrested and forcefully admitted to a mental health hospital.  I feel bad for Craig.  He's a very sweet guy and deserves to find a great guy.  But he's sort of the antithesis of me in that he's not discriminating enough in his romantic life.  He goes from boy friend to boy friend.  Since he came out, he's spent more time in relationships than out of them.  Of course, I'm way too discriminating.  I've never actually had a relationship.  Graham Norton is back on.  I've seen clips of his British show.  He's not butch, but sadly he is butching it up for the American audience.  Let me think of what else I can add.  The chick at the tanning salon has a great set of jugs.  I went to the gym again of course.  I'm a gym bunny.  Damn there were some hot guys there.  I have a bad record of dealing with guys who may or may not be gay and trying to get my attention.  So I have a strict policy of just ignoring them.  Damn, I wish I went to a gay gym.  Actually, maybe I don't.  I can't think of anything else to say, so I guess that's it.

      As rants go, I think my previous post was pretty good.  It didn't completely make since, but there were plenty of F-bombs.  Anyway, I've found nothing calms me down like a good 45-minute work out at the gym.  Sure, I get frustrated looking at guys whose bodies mine will never come close to being the equal.  But I'm trying and that fact makes me feel better.  I feel like at least I'm not moving backward.  And I work out the frustrations of the day.  I've decided I really should go to South Beach with Aaron, Jeff, and Co. Saturday night.  Sure the little shits will be scampering around the floor again, but I'll try harder to avoid them this time.  I don't need to meet another Elliott.  I just need to meet more guys in the area and hope to God the first friend Aaron introduces me to doesn't mark me as his target as soon as he sees me again.  I still feel bad about ditching him, but I was overwhelmed and had no idea what the hell was going on.  Anyway, pretty soon I'm going to stop avoiding the subject of my private life with some of my straight friends.  I still won't bring it up as a matter of principle: it shouldn't matter, so they shouldn't care.  And I'm very sure most of them don't care.  The reason I haven't told them is that there hasn't been a reason to do so and I don't like to bother with uncomfortable situations for no good reason.  I was hoping to have a boy friend, which would have been a good reason to bring it up.  But what are the odds that will happen in the next few years given it hasn't happened once in the past three (which is roughly when I began looking)?  Damn I'm such a loser.  Anyway, my change for the day is the decision to go out Saturday night and do my best to be social.  At least I'll finally have a good excuse to wear my $60 jeans.  I'm going to tan in the morning and get a hair cut.  I have to make myself pretty.  Lately I've stopped bothering with my appearance.  I'm usually very casual (old t-shirt, Old Navy jeans or shorts).  That may be partly why I'm usually over looked.  Maybe I'm just too plain.  I don't think I'm fat.  Everyone tells me I'm skinny, which annoys me just as much as being called fat would actually.  Maybe I'm just too good at making that "Approach With Caution" face.  Anyway, I need to get to bed to get up early.  Good night!

      I have a lot to say today.  So far I've been relatively calm and collected.  Now it's time for me to rant and get some crap off my chest.  First of all I want to say a big "FUCK YOU!" to every single "friend" who ever treated me like a burden.  Sure, I've ignored it and maybe I even acted like I didn't notice it or forgave it.  But believe me, none of that is the case.  If a friend asks a favor of me, I WILL CHANGE MY PLANS FOR THE DAY TO THE MOST EXTREME EXTENT POSSIBLE TO HELP!  I WILL AND HAVE ENDURED PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL PAIN FOR NOTHING MORE THAN A THANK YOU!  And I ask for nothing more than a thank you.  I don't want to be "paid back" for helping out a friend.  I do these things for my friends because I consider them to be my friends.  I've noticed few of my "friends" are willing to endure what I endured for them for me.  I guess I should be more selective about who I do favors for.  Maybe the problem lies in my virtual inability to ask for help.  Few things hurt me more than to be made to feel like a burden.  I guess that's why I have such a hard time asking anyone for real help when I need it.  It's something I'll have to overcome, but I don't know how.  It will be like teaching myself to breath underwater.  Secondly, I want to give a big "FUCK YOU!" out to the gay "community".  I say "community" because there really is no such thing.  This weekend is Pride weekend.  I understand the reasoning behind it: to not feel ashamed of your sexuality.  However, it's difficult to be proud of a group to which you have virtually no connection.  I'm very different from most gay men.  I'm sick of hearing guys say, "I'm not into the scene".  They're such a fucking cliche, just like guys who say, "I don't like fems because I like men".  I have met one gay guy in my entire life who actually said he thinks feminine guys are cute.  Almost no gay guys like fem guys!  And most of the guys who say they don't like fem guys are themselves very feminine and don't realize it!  This leads me to a major conclusion I've reached about gay men: they are often incapable of self-criticism.  Sure, they often have low self-esteem issues, poor self-image, and self-destructive tendencies, but self-criticism is meant to be constructive and all the typical gay emotional afflictions are destructive.    Too many gay men swing between the extremes of unimpeded arrogance and chronic depression.  I don't really know why, but I can't deal with it.  I have dealt with chronic depression (lasting longer than 2 weeks) many times in my life and will undoubtedly battle it again.  But I make every effort to keep my ego in check.  I probably do it more than is healthy.  In fact, my zeal for humility is probably part of why I feel I live a life without emotional highs, only lows.  I'm not sure I think I should be happy.  I want to be happy and sometimes I am trully happy.  But I'm not sure I will ever be happy for any extended period of time.  I'm too different.  I'm always alone.  All I want is a devoted companion who makes me feel needed and wanted and for whom I can do the same.  But in my 24 years, I've never met a single guy who even came close to offering that.  I'm sure I'll always be alone, because I'm just too different.  So fuck you for not being the person I need in my life!  Thirdly, I want to point out that I hate the word "faggot".  I hate its use by anyone.  Most people don't know what it means or its origins.  I do.  I consider it to be the most offensive word in the English language.  So at least don't use the word around me.  That's about it I guess.  I feel lighter, but not any better.  Oh, and fuck Rose-Hulman!  Fuck Samuel Hulbert!  Fuck Tom Miller!  Fuck everyone who runs that God-damned school!

      Next weekend I'm moving out of the apartment I've been living in with a roommate into an apartment of my own.  I made this decision based on two assumptions: 1) I was capable of folding clothes or stacking books and could therefore get a part-time job and 2) I would be going to grad school at Texas A & M in the spring.  I made the second assumption based on information I found on tamu.edu and applytexas.org that indicated they accept spring applicants into the Master of Urban Planning program.  Of course, literaly a few hours after I signed a 6-month lease beginning July 2nd, A & M e-mailed me to say they do not accept spring applicants into that program.  WOO-FUCKING-HOO!  I have also, thus far, failed to obtain a part-time job.  Of course, I've been looking for various jobs for over a year now and have failed to find anything, which is why I concluded I needed to go back to school ASAP.  I chose Texas A & M because multiple sources indicated it had the most respected urban planning program in the region.  This region is where I have decided I want to start my career.  I like Texas.  I have lived in New York, Chicago, Houston, Guangzhou (formerly Canton), Shekou (near Hong Kong), Vienna, and Indiana.  Of all the places I have ever lived, the Houston area is my favorite (with the exception of Vienna, Austria, but I won't be returning there any time soon).  I went to college in Indiana and quickly realized there is no fucking way in hell I will ever live in the Midwest again: I prefer a quick death to a slow and painful one.  In fact, it will be many years before I'll be able to set foot in that God-forsaken state again.  I apologize to anyone who lives in or is from Indiana, but for me it was literaly Hell.  Since my crappy little college has no name recognition in Texas, my degree is worthless here.  So I learned the hard way the importance of going to school where you want to at least start your career.  There are a few other programs in Texas.  UT-Arlington, TSU, and Rice all have similar programs, but I'm not about to graduate with another degree that doesn't mean shit to anyone in my field.  I could look outside Texas, but that opens up a whole other can of cliches.  I dearly regret having left Texas for undergraduate school, so I doubt I'll be able to drag myself out of state again for graduate school.  I want to live and work in a major metropolitan area (more than 2 million residents) after I graduate.  Texas has three of these: Houston, Dallas-Ft. Worth, and San Antonio-Austin.  Only California can offer that or better.  I might research some programs outside of Texas, but I sincerely doubt I'll bother to even apply to any.  Getting back to my original point though, I signed a 6-month lease.  I may now ask to change it to a 12-month lease to see if I can get a better deal.  I feel very stupid.  I should have checked with an actual person at A & M before even considering a new apartment.  I won't fuck up like this again.  Ha!  I'll at least try not to for a week.  I began packing my shit today to try to try and make the move as painless as possible.  I take possession of the apartment on July 2nd, after I take the GRE.  I'll move the small shit that afternoon and then the following morning.  My friend Sam, probably my best friend right now, will help me move the big shit on the 3rd in his family's Suburban.  That's my plan.  Start placing bets now on how the universe will fuck it up.  I'm betting a whale suddenly falls out of the sky and somehow lands only on my apartment (which is on the 2nd floor of a 3-story building) due to a spaceship powered by Douglas Adams' Improbability Drive passing by Earth.  I'd better get renter's insurance.

      Welcome to the blog of Mike Reavey.  I've been going through a pretty rough period and I thought this might be a good forum to work things out.  No one seems to listen to me anyway, so I might as well write stuff down that no one will read too.  First let me explain the title of my blog: From Ned To Morris.  Most people probably haven't seen a brilliant little movie called  Waking Ned Devine .  If you haven't, you really owe it to yourself to watch it.  It's a very clever comedy about Ireland's "Celtic Tiger" economy.  The two characters of concern here are Ned Devine and Morris.  I hate people who give away plot twists, so  if you don't want the movie ruined, don't read the next section in parentheses!     (Ned, the dead old man who won the lottery, represents the old, impoverished Ireland while Morris, the young boy who turns out to be his illegitimate son, naturally represents the new, prosperous Ireland.)  It really is a witty little film with a borderline militantly socialist undercurrent.  But back to my explanation.   Waking Ned Devine  is about a transition.  And, as major transitions tend to go, it's a particularly cofusing one.  We're all always going through transitions in some part of our lives.  I chose this as the title of my blog because this is a time in my life when I have to go through major transitions in every aspect of my life if I'm going to survive this.  To put it as candidly and briefly as possible, I have no career, no romantic life, and I often wonder if I even have many friends.  Everyday my growing stockpile of successive failures in every aspect of my life forces me to question my intelligence, attractiveness, competence, personality, and ultimately my worth as a human being.  I often feel that I'm really of no use to anyone.  I've tried to remedy the situation many times before, only to be shot down almost as quickly as I get off the ground.  This is sort of a last resort.  Everyday I'm going to try to record what I did to change something in my life that was holding me back.

      That's what my friend Craig just told me anyway.  Anyway, it's been a while since I blogged.  I need to get back in the habbit of writing every day.  Or at least every other day.  But in my defense, I've been really busy.    Let's see, I haven't heard from Peter.  I doubt I will.  I'll give him a call sometime this week maybe.  I didn't go out with Aaron and Jeff because I was tired and just couldn't bear the thought of being at South Beach until 3am.  I don't go to SoBe to socialize, because there are a lot of losers at that place.  I'll go sometime when I have a date.  So I'll pretty much never go back I guess.    Of course, not going to SoBe didn't stop some other friends from keeping me up until after 2am.  And since I wake up between 7 and 8am every morning at my new apartment for the time being, I didn't sleep enough last night and I'm a tad cranky.    Another one bites the dust.  Craig just told me he met his latest love interest while having a threesome last week.  I don't know many gay people I can relate to.  Craig was one of a few I thought came close.  I don't really think that's the case anymore.  But it's his life.    I'm considering becoming an air traffic controller.  It would mean at least another 4 years of education and training, but I honestly think it could be for me.  My dream job location is an airport.  It would be awesome to have a job where I got to see airplanes all day.  And, contrary to popular opinion perhaps, I do get a bit of a rush from a fast paced environment.  Anyway, that brings this blog up-to-date for the most part.  Oh yeah, it goes without saying I still haven't gotten a damn job and I have no romantic prospects.

      I just woke up from a particularly depressing dream.  Otherwise I wouldn't be up at this ungodly hour.  I was with the guy I was really "into" in college and we were trying to have sex, but no matter what we did we couldn't.  We had even rented a special room for privacy.  When we weren't being interupted, we were dealing with his younger brother and sister (which apparently he has, at least in my dream).  There was just so much other shit to deal with, we never got around to it.  Maybe it's my new mattress, but that dream was disturbingly accurate.  I hate my life.

      Much has been made about the relationship between Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, and Julius Caesar, General and Consul of Rome.  Cleopatra was long characterized as a seductive temptress.  But we know she wasn't particularly attractive.  Some have theorized that Caesar was attracted to her intelligence and strong will.  Excuse me while I react to that notion.  HA!  Caesar was a known womanizer and showed little to no respect for most women.  The idea that a megalomaniacal, patriarchal Roman would find a strong will and high level of intelligence in a woman desirable is idiotic.  Caesar desired Cleopatra for a very different reason: she offered Caesar a connection to Alexander the Great.  Cleopatra was, of course, the last ruler of the Ptolemaic Dynasty.  Ptolemy was one of Alexanders commanders on his grand campaign of conquest throughout the known world.  After Alexander died, his empire was divided among various commanders in his army.  Ptolemy took Egypt.  It's a well documented fact that Julius Caesar admired and envied Alexander his whole life.  When Caesar was still a little known Roman general, he visited the tomb of Alexander and broke down crying.  He was tormented by the fact that he was 32 and by that age Alexander had already conquered the world.  Caesar's need to prove himself at least the equal of Alexander drove his entire life.  Cleopatra offered him an opportunity to build an indirect link between himself and Alexander.  Caesar chose to father a child by Cleopatra to create someone who would forever link his line with that of Alexander.  I'm sure he thought the heir of both Julius Caesar and Alexander of Macedon would be unstoppable.  Perhaps that is why so many of his contemporaries feared this illegitimate child.  Cleopatra, naturally, needed Caesar to rebuild Egypt so it could continue to be a viable independent state in the Mediterranean world.  I do not think there was any love or lust between these two highly ambitious people.  They saw the chance to create a legitimate heir to rule over the entire world.  Of course, their son didn't survive long.  It's little wonder Octavian viewed Cleopatra and her son as such an enormous threat.

      It's been a little while since I wrote last.  I moved and I've been busy and haven't felt the urge to write.  I've begun looking for a part-time job.  I'm researching grad schools.  I'm getting my apartment organized.  And I'm trying to have a life.  I'm having mediocre success on most fronts.  I may have met a cool guy.  We've e-mailed a few times since last week.  He goes to Rice.  He'll live very close to me in a few weeks.  He looks cute too.  I really need a boyfriend to talk to.  I need someone to make me feel less like a freak.  For some reason I made the mistake of reading about a particular closeted Hollywood actor and his semi-closeted boyfriend and their alleged hook-ups.  They're all so hedonistic.  It really bothers me.  I guess I shouldn't care, except that when I was that age and needed someone to look up to, there was no one.  In my search for someone to look up to, all I found were dirty whores and old men.  I saw none of myself in either.  It caused me a lot of pain and, frankly, still does.  Oh well, maybe someday young gay men will be well adjusted enough to show some modesty and realize that sex isn't a substitute for love.

      Well, I took the GRE today.  Since no one will read this, I can brag.  I got an average score on the Verbal section, 540.  But I got a 730 on the Analytical section.  WOO-FUCKIN-HOO!  I knew I was at least a little smart.  Anyway, I got the keys to my new apartment.  I may need them to fix the AC tomorrow.  The apartment was a little warm the two times I was there yesterday.  Other than that, it was nice.  I can't get over how big it is.  Moving will be a bitch, as it always is.  I went to Miyako with some friends tonight.  Hollis, Andres, Lauren Farr, Roxanne, and two of Jenny's friends were there.  Jenny and William weren't able to make it.  It's always surreal being around Andres.  He's openly gay and I am not.  Of course, he also has that annoying know-it-all attitude that way too many gay men have.  Andres is particularly bad.  He's a nice guy, I just can't stand it when he slips into know-it-all mode.  I used to have a problem with that.  I think I've suppressed myself sufficiently.  I try anyway.    Tonight I realized why I chose not to tell Hollis.  I don't want him to be part of my personal life.  I just don't know if I like him any more as a friend.  I'm really tired.  I got maybe 4 hours of sleep last night.  I need to go to bed.  Good night.
