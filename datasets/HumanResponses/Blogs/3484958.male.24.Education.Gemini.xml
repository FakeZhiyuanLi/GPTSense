      Well here I am, and I'm not quite sure if I'll have the resolve to get through more than a weeks worth of these before I give up on them like I do most things. I have a problem with temporary fascination. I'll get real into something for 2 weeks to a month and then break every promise I made to commit to it. Oh well, it wouldn't be true if I didn't try..  Right now I'm 24 and I just moved back in with my parents on Long Island after 5 years of college and 1 year of performing in a show called "Blast!" The exclamation point is not because I'm excited about it, its just that the name of the show includes the exclamation point. I think.   In any case, here I am, living a life of temporary celibacy and getting to know my dog. His name is Rudy and he's a Bichon Frise. Don't know what that is? I didn't either. All I know now is that he apparently has separation anxiety that he's taking (herbal) medication for. This is what the world has come to. It doesn't really help him, either.  This weekend I'll be Canoeing upstate with my brother Ken and his friends on the Delaware River. If you can call it that. It's close enough to NYC that the overcrowded camp grounds resemble the South Bronx on a "Fresh Air Fund" hiatus. I tried to get us to move further up river, but no one likes too much solitude I guess and my idea was squashed.   I'm a vegetarian, so that means this weekend while camping will give me alot of crazy stares. From people who smoke, no less. It's funny, considering the relative damage done, why do people give you a hard time for NOT eating industrialized brutalized mutant animals 2-3 meals a day? I'll never figure that one out.   Okay enough is enough. This is my first blog. I wonder how many people actually read this crap? I'll be upstate at the Crips' yearly BBQ and volleyball tounament. Be back on Monday.

      Okay, for those of you who don't know who she is, Maureen Dowd is an op-ed columnist for the New York Times. She is a stark raving liberal who hates the Bush Administration (+), however her journalism can sometimes go overboard in trendiness and cattiness (-). So I'll skim her articles, but rarely will I read an entire op-ed piece by here because I know I'll probably agree with her and so what's the point of reading that?  Well she was on the Daily Show last night, and all I can say is MeeeeeOwwwww! Good lord I don't even want to know how old she is, but she is smart, witty, and just a liiiiitle snobby to keep things interesting. And a body that just.... won't..... quit! Yeah!  So it comes down to this: If Tina Fey doesn't have a good season with Weekend Update on SNL in the fall, then Maureen Dowd may very well take her place for SEXIEST WOMAN ON EARTH. (According to me.)

      So I just went to Dunks for a small coffee and a boston cream donut, and the girl hangs her head out the drive-up window and says, "Did you know that 1 Boston Cream Donut has the same fat and calories as 2 Big Macs?"

      Honestly, I'm sure pretty pregnant women have been getting knocked off for thousands of years. Murder is awful and murdering a pregnant women is VERY awful, but here's my problem. This is not, and should never be, considered "news."  What do you mean, Chris? Well I'll tell you.  "News" is meant to be something that is pertinent to a changing society. When someone reads or watches the "News" they are esentially saying, "Hey, what's NEW?" Now if you asked me that and I told you, "Pregnant women sometimes get murdered," you would think "Yeah, that's true, but so do all other kinds of people. And I knew that already."   So my point is that there's a genocide happening right now in Sudan and most of America can't find that on a fucking map. But everybody knows for sure that Scott Peterson's mistress was wearing blue panties last Easter.   Sigh.

      And if you don't know that, then you either don't run a whole lot or are one of those bitches who were born with wings on their feet.

      Today Rudy was kind of depressed, which can be a welcome change from his usual hair-raising anxiety. But I started thinking after I talked to my brother yesterday. You see, Rudy is a VERY smart dog, which I think is the source of alot of his "issues." And I think he gets very bored being stuck in the house all the time. So I'm going to make an effort to get him out of the house or take him for rides in the car as often as I can. Couldn't hurt, and maybe it will chill him out a bit.  Sometimes I think it would help alot of people to get out of the damn house. Dogs may not be an exception.

      It's funny how at 4am I can wake up and feel more refreshed than I do on pretty much any morning of the week... AND my dad just got up to go to work, while I'm sitting here posting a blog to myself on the internet. I'm such a douche, I'm going to bed.

      Two months and change and here comes the second post. Very nice. Well if I'm not consistent then at least I'm predictable. Hey, so I'm about to go out and do some running, which I do about 3-4 times a week, but in the 3 days on/4 days off kind of fashion. So by the time I get my ass down to the track again I lose recollection of when exactly the last time was. Maybe I should keep a blog for my running routine.   This whole next week I'm teaching drumlines at night from 5-9 or so, then next week starts a 7 day-long band camp that goes from 9-9. It really sucks because this school does theirs at home instead of going away. So the instructors aren't at least getting a free vacation out of it. Hey at least it pays well. It would be nice if someone paid you before the end of the summer for this shit though. No matter, I'll be rolling in it once they all do.   I started writing a novel. If anyone actually read this who knew me they would laugh. Even I'm smiling right now. I guess I could write why that is funny, but then I would only be amusing myself. Which has gotten a bit boring lately.  I need to run.
