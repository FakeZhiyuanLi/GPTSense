      after a really long time. I don't remember the last 3 day weekend I had! I do remember our trips to Miami and Las Vegas though.. so it hasn't been a really long time since I've had time off from work but I could always use some more!! :)  Well the mother in law is visiting for Memorial day weekend, we're taking her to Alcatraz and our local temple but nothing else is decided, lets see.

      Check out OQO's upcoming  urlLink marvel portable computer . It compares well with Sony's Type U which is yet to be launched. I think I like OQO right now (not just because they are from the bay area but) because of the additional advantage of having a keypad/board. The future promises exciting development :)

      Last week was mine and my mil's birthday week. =) Was very nice. I enjoyed it. On my birthday, Wednesday, May 19th, we went for a nice hike in Las Trampus.      Then we had some good chinese food and slept like baby. I flew to SB on Thursday. My wonderful company 4YourSoul got a super jillako coconut cake for me ..really yummy. Mohammed was recording the whole thing, I was bit embrassed. Then, I flew back to SFO on Friday. Just relaxed. On saturday, we went and picked up my vehicle. It looks brand new. I was horrified and tensed driving it for the first time after the accident. It was very tough for me. I got over it soon though. Yesterday, we went for a small hike (look for the blue line in the map).     I got lot of gifts from Arvind. Umah.. thanks Arvind.

      Well, in a little more than 12 hours, my parents are going to be on their way to Sydney to visit Arjun, the other sibling! Although my father has flown many times before, its going to be my mother's first time. For her and others jittery of getting on the first flight, here are some  urlLink helpful tips . As for myself, I've always liked travelling. I like flying better than taking a bus, car or train because flying gives me time to do things - read books, listen to music, sleep, watch movies. Normally, I tend to experience motion-sickness if I try doing those things while in motion but flights are calmer. A mind that's relaxed helps to make travelling that much stress-free. :)

      We went for a nice hike today. Morgan Territory Regional Preserve. Was little tough for me. AG did very well. Check it out. The highlighted part on the left is our 2 hr hike(appr. 6 miles).     Burnt lot of calories.  After hiking, we went to a nice local diner and ate like pigs!:) mmmmm yummy!!

      We swam a bit and went to the hot tub. Arvind had slight headache and we decided to take it light. We went to bed early. Woke up early and now generally browsing. Today is a dull day. Its not as sunny. We might go out for hiking and do something fun.  AG is feeling better this morning.  Mom& Dad, I got your comments. heheh..cool. Thanks so much for your wishes. My sb trip is confirmed. Good thing is i'm not driving. I'm flying to sb on Thursday morning and coming back Friday. =) We'll talk to you tomorrow night.

      is what the Indian politicians in office have lost touch with, apparently. How else does one explain the  urlLink Congress' surge into office  when the BJP is in its finest period - the economy is surging, peace with Pak is on the horizon, the Indian cricket team is doing great and India is a world power to be reckoned with - militarily and economically. The BJP was so confident of victory that it called elections 6 months early! It appears that the common man was not too impressed; there's a lesson to be learned - development in India cannot start from the urban centres, but from the inside out. Hopefully, the Congress party will keep India on the road to development while addressing the concerns of the rural poor.

      Finally I have started exercising. 5 continuous days. Oh feels good.  Must be a record (just kidding). Lets see whether I keep the momentum going. Very tiring day, I couldnt wait to get away from home. I might not go to santa Barbara this weekend, my car is still not ready :( both good and bad.

      How else can you explain  urlLink Van Helsing 's box office topping performance this last weekend? I'd rate it mediocre at best. Ratings given by users at  urlLink Yahoo  or  urlLink IMDB  tell us its no great movie but the number of ratings are pretty high for a movie in its first week. It proves that good advertising is still pretty successful in taking people for a ride!

      Small case of the monday morning blues. However, we had a wonderful weekend. As the weather has gotten warmer we have been more active, so it appears there's still hope of getting back to slimmer times :)  Blogger has had a major makeover and so it was time for me to update as well. Hope you like the new look!

      I like the way the website is shaping up. I do have tons more to do though. In the last few days, I have added the comments section so y'all out there can communicate back. I see the folks have already started using that feature :)  The other new addition is 'My Calendar' - see my links on the right. Through this webpage I can publish my schedule from my laptop. Its good for me to be able to check it over the web and also for you to see what I am upto.  I really should use my iCal a lot more!

Nothing much has been happening apart from hanging out locally and having general fun. I'm very excited about the thought of my parents visiting my brother in Australia, yay! Good luck with the visa, et al.

      I went for swimming class yesterday. It was fun, since it was a begineer class, i was the best..heheh. i loved it. I tried treading in 7 1/2 feet water, was very scary. But I did anyways. I wasn't good, hopefully by the end of 3 weeks, i would know to tread. My free style is pretty good, thats what my good-looking (;-))instructor said!:) hehe. Fun to be back in learning mode. i might go to swimming today. we dropped anna at airport yesterday and saw Kurien. He is getting married on July 10th. It was good to catch up with him. Worked whole of last night and slept thro the morning. busy, busy, busy...

      Steve Jobs just finished his keynote at the Apple WWDC. The Apple site is already buzzing with all the new stuff. Notable links -   urlLink Tiger preview  - Tons of new features, keeps the heat on Longhorn.   urlLink New Apple Displays  - Unfortunately, no price cuts. The 30" display is HUGE. It needs two DVI connections.   urlLink XCode 2.0   urlLink New iChat  - Chat with multiple users  Guess an iMac G5 is still in the works :)

      is building up, leading to monday's WWDC in San Francisco. Rumor sites are rife with rumors, here's some of the top ones -  1. New LCD displays (a new 30" widescreen is expected to be introduced at $2999, prices on 20" and 23" LCDs are to be dropped). The new displays are to drop ADC and embrace DVI.  2. A G5 iMac in a new enclosure - the rumors point to a new design with the logic board behind the LCD. Its hard to see how Apple can lift sales higher than the current iMac without a major price reduction. 3. There has to be at least one significant iPod - related announcement. There are no solid reports about this though.   Of course, Apple has been on a roll recently. After Airport Express, they have launched iTunes in Europe, new PowerMac G5s, Remote Desktop 2.0 and iPod connectivity for BMWs. Stock prices are hovering around highs and at least a couple of analysts have increased their target prices. Apple mania has set in. Watch this space next week :)     And oh yeah, the next version of OS X - OS X.4 (Tiger) will be previewed too.

      in Mount Diablo was fun. I was there with Stephen, Mike and a friend of his. Stephen took a jump and went para-gliding first. He was in the air a short while - we drove down and picked him up. We started on the Burma road loop, which was termed "short but astoundingly steep" (read  urlLink here ), trying Stephen's mountain board wherever we could. It was fun, with its share of falls - I fell once, Stephen fell once. Climbing down the steep start was dangerous and slippery. I fell a couple of times more.. we ended the evening with dinner at an English pub in Danville - fish and chips English style - yum! None of us had a camera, unfortunately.

      Last weekend(6/5 and 6/6) was fun.. We both had a good time. On friday, we tried to see "Harry Potter" but it was sold out. So we booked for saturday and came back. We both got early next morning, went for a car wash and then we were off to redwood park. I wasn't aware of this big hike, so i ate very little for breakfast :( so I was very tired when i hiked in redwood state park. It was very beautiful but the climb was tough for me. here is the map(approx. 4.3 miles):    . Came home took a quick shower, ate something and ran to the movie. Movie was awesome. I loved everybit of it. There was lot of missing info, since i read the book, i filled in the gaps for ag. Then, we had a very lazy sunday morning, went to REI and got something for our kayak and went for a walk. Saw a bit of "EuroTrip" movie. It was funny, arvind was laughing his heart out...its funny to see arvind laugh like that. O yeah, lakers lost. Cant wait for game 2. Catch you all soon!:)

        Yesterday for the first time in my life, I dived into a 10 ft pool. The most scariest thing ever for me. It was fun though. I thought i need help coming up to surface, but that was the easy part. I'm comfortable with treading. This is great. Still scared of jumping from the springboard. Swimming is the only thing that keeps me going these days, otherwise work is hetic because of the new website release.

      is apparently not always the most pleasant shopping experience. Of course, I would only realize this when I'm waiting on a replacement wireless router for the home network. Not only are they taking their time in shipping available items but my Warcraft 3 disc which was supposed to arrive today, hasn't! And why, do you ask? Because the tracking number that was given to me was not mine! So here I've been sitting tracking this package shipped to Pleasanton, CA only to realize that it was delivered today to someone else. I call UPS and they tell me it wasn't addressed to me. I call Amazon (*much* better than communicating by email) only to be told 'Oh! Then we will just ship it again to you'. No apologies or even an apologetic tone! They cannot even trace that tracking number to see if it was indeed another order or whatever. In any case, I ordered these 4 items last week and am yet to see even one of them. I don't even know if I will get anything by next week!  In contrast, I ordered some books, CD and a T-shirt from Overstock and the order arrived in pieces yesterday and today. This order was placed a whole 2 days after my Amazon order! Is Amazon.com slacking? I hope not!

      Well, after a year of resisting I think I will finally give in and purchase an iPod sometime after the new one comes out in August. The Net MD player just isn't cutting it and Hi-MD doesn't seem to be the right solution either. I don't use my MD as a recording device and the iPod definitely beats carrying ATRAC discs. Besides, I already have an iTunes library.  Gizmodo shows you  urlLink how the ipod might look . In other updates, the home network is still down. That is the only explanation I have for the lack of new posts from me. Of course, all the time at work is taken up by getting used to C# and .NET so it has been busy. Ranju should have gotten engaged today, congrats to him (I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know this site exists). Waiting for him before I check out Spiderman 2! App is going to be away in Las Vegas for the next 2 days, FYI.

      Thanks for all your wishes. We had a wonderful anniversary !:) It was great. We went to temple, came home and then went to  a nice restaurant. Ate lot of good food, very good wine , discussed all the issues we ever had. Felt good. Came home, called arjun , then arvind's mom & dad and then my dad. Got everyone's best wishes and blessings. Whole of saturday we spent so lazily :) just ate left overs from fridays and then went for swimming. Came home and saw "The missing". SOOOOOOO BORING. Mr.Ganesh made me see it. Just wanted to spend some time with him cuddling up so i didnt mind that.  Apporom, today I was so tired so i ended seeing  more movies, the medallion and then "White Oleander". White oleander is such a sad but a moving story. I heard the most of the book on cd. Its so depressing that i decided to see it as a movie and return the cds back to the library. It most definitely made me think a lot about orphan children and their horrible life at foster home. Arvind was very happy with me today, I let him play starcraft for 4 hours. can you believe it?  We grilled some vegiees today and ate it. Such a hot hot day. So we went for a long walk late in the night and came home.  O yeah, our router went kaput on friday due to electricity failure. :( so we are trying to find a soln for that. Other than that, what a  wonderful weekend.

      Yesterday's class was great. I've learnt to tread now. Getting better with it. I'm so excited abt it. Then the instructor taught me to flip. Well, i couldnt do it properly. So i'm going to practice tonight at the pool.   Today i tried a recipe from woman's day. Great eggplant sandwich.. arvind & me loveeeed it. We got mom, dad and arjun's card for our anniversary. It was awesome. I loved that picture they sent us. I already framed it. =) Thanks so much!:)  apporom, i got the big 19" LCD monitor at home. It's so huge.

      Hello folks, we are back from our last minute visit to Avalon, Santa Catalina Island. Things turned out mostly for the better and it was a great vacation. Photos are online,  urlLink check them out .  We were back on sunday and I spent yesterday trying to clean up some of the clutter in the garage. In other news, we might have finally resolved the situation with the monitor at home. If all goes well, we should have a new 19" monitor soon. Nothing much else to post right now, later!

      well, arvind decided to go to catalina islands. So we packed late tonight and leaving early morning. We have not booked anything yet!:) hopefully we will get accomodations there soon.  I went to see a dermatologist today. I wanted to see a lady doctor to see if she would give me different medication for my acne problem. She gave the anti-biotics again. :( o well, she seems nice, i dont mind trying something to reduce acne. i wish there was a natural cure for this acne.   then, i went to swimming class (its tue & thursdays from 7- 7:45). I saw a guy, just like arvind trying to learn swimming. I learnt breast stroke today. Its tough, it needs lot of strength in arms and legs to move. Arvind & me then sat down to decide on which LCD monitor to buy. Then packed.. busy evening i should say. this will be our mini anniversary celebration. Australia trip will be big one!:-) Oh yeah, i tried brown rice today and loved the taste! It has much more flavor than regular jasmine rice. yummm...

      In case you're wondering about the pause in the posts. The last couple of weeks have been.. well.. weird. I haven't been as active as I usually am. Life as usual for the most part. Well, Steve Jobs is recovering from cancer. Hopefully that won't put the iMac G5 off track. Oh yeah, I got an iPod! 40 gig, 4th Generation. Like it but need a skin before I can carry it everywhere.  The iFrame project is shaping up. Will take some pics for you to see how things are shaping up.  I had my annual review at work, it went well I thought.  Nothing much else, am still playing Starcraft. And a little bit of Warcraft. When App allows me access to the desk, of course! :)
