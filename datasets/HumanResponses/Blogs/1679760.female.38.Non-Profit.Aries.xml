      1.  Got yet another compliment on a dress that's both comfortable & cost just $15.  2.  IMAO's Know Thy Enemy: Michael Moore.  Good sophomoric fun with lines like this:  "As for people who are rational and don't hate Bush, any attempt by Michael Moore to convert them to drooling idiots is undone by him appearing on screen causing people to shout, "Who is that fat, fat ugly man? Whatever views he has, I want the opposite!"  Go  urlLink here  for the whole list.  3.   urlLink My wondrous mate  & I start our vacation tomorrow - we're already packed!!!  Today - all the fun lies ahead.

      - Evidently, I'm also a  urlLink family lawyer in Los Angeles .  Who knew?  - Use lint rollers for cleaning lamp shades - it really works!  - For those conservatives who want a warm fuzzy & those out there who are con-curious, go read Dinesh D'Souza's  Letters to a Young Conservative .  It's good, it's short & to the point.  - My dear Jeff saved me from getting caught in last evening's Metro mess by suggesting we meet for dinner on the hill.  Pizza, chianti & company were great & no crowds.  All was well. Oh, yeh, and we ran into most excellent chef Enzo Fargione of  urlLink Barolo .  Very nice dude & he remembered us.  Ain't it cool?  - Meningitis, mystery disease.  Once in a while the Metro area has a micro-outbreak.  Weird.  Read about it  urlLink here .

      The Catch of the Day today is  urlLink The Nation  (online).  Not because I think it's a great mag, but because it's such a target-rich environment.  Let's see, what do the crackhead lefties really think?  Good fodder for rants. :)

      Ok, work madness intensifies.  I wanna leave now.  Lame post.    Um, I don't envy the Princess Masako of Japan.  Oh, the pressure of bearing a son.  I'm willing to bet she regrets getting into this whole scene.  Shingles - gack.  Read the story  urlLink here .  For the record, I will eventually have many tattoos - not just a few. But never, ever, will I have one of the DC flag.  Evidently, those are becoming popular in our uh, fair city.  Look  urlLink here .  End transmission.

      Today in the Post was a  urlLink salute  to 13-year-old Mattie Stepanek who just died of a rare form of muscular dystrophy.  For those who haven't heard of this little guy, during his short lifetime, he wrote several tomes of inspirational poetry in an effort to do something to make the world a better place.  Makes one wonder what we, the able-bodied, of the probable long-life span, can do to make a difference.  Along those lines (making a difference), Frank J. at IMAO shares his earnest 25-year-old thoughts in  urlLink The Angst of an Average American .  And who says youngsters aren't thoughtful?  Check it out.

      Perhaps I was giving off negative vibes today on the metro, but every darn guy was stepping on my toes, bumping me with his briefcase, side-swiping me with elbows, etc.  Although, each did say "excuse me."    I got into work to find an email asking for a change on a previously submitted request.  Hello out there - do you really think I have time to do things twice or three times?  Does anyone have 2 neurons to rub together? Huh???  For some reason, this makes me think of the book  The Roaches Have No King , by Daniel Evan Weiss  (thanks, Aunt Joan!).  Puts the phrase "the meek shall inherit the earth" into new perspective.

      Ok, so I finally watched the DVD of "Wait Until Dark," starring one of the most winsome actresses ever & one of my favorites, Audrey Hepburn.  Synopsis:  blind gal becomes embroiled in scary situation involving determined bad guys. She's plucky & smart and is assisted by a youngster who is also plucky & smart without being annoying.  There is just one rather off-putting part which shall remain nameless - just go rent it & let me know what you think.    I give the film a B+.

      Ok, I must make a confession, as confessing is good for the soul & I'm always concerned about the state of my soul. Anyway, the horrible secret is that I voted for Clinton (first term).  I know, I know - I'll never live that one down or do enough penance to clear that one up.  But it was my first time voting & the Rs were pissing me off.  As if I'd want to get an expensive education, just to be another Muffy Quayle.  Gack.  Yet, that's the message I got. Heck, I even thought I was a liberal!  Those of you who know me are probably spewing your coffee all over your screen right now, eh?  It was a confused time.  Now I'm all better.  But, on the Clinton subject - evidentally, he has a book out or something.  For the record, I will not be buying or reading his "biography." He is veritable scum & I think he must be sociopathic. So there. But...as soon as I get that Amazon.com thingy set up, I might link to the book ref so that I can make money off him for a change.  See Renee do the Dance of Capitalist Superiority!

      ...that I'm about to go postal on some of my coworkers?  You know, if I ever do have children - they'll be no problem - I'll have had years of experience dealing with mindless infants wearing suits.  At least the actual children will be inquisitive, will learn & will grow up at some point.

      Well, it looks like the hoards at work are conspiring to drive me mad in the week before our vacation.  You know, I try to be conscientious and careful about my job so that things are done right the first time, in a timely fashion & none of us go to jail.  Unfortunately, this depends on stuff from other people - done right & completely - which is generally hit or miss.  Today folks are really trying my patience on that number.    That & I have a final exam in Spanish for which I'm not certain I'm adequately prepared. Oh well.  In other news, I've added a blogroll & a site roll to my site.  Check it out.  I'll be adding to them as I go along.  Good news in the conjoined twins front - they made it thru the separation procedure.  Check out the story  urlLink here . Girls - be strong & heal fast -you've made it this far!  Thanks to a head-up from Jeff, I now know that  urlLink private space travel  has been successfully initiated.  For a good historical novel on the beginnings of space travel, read James Mitchener's  Space .  Really elucidated the reason why test pilots were the first astronauts.  That's all for now - should be a doozy of a day!

      Usually I offer only one Catch of the Day, but today I'll share another very cool link -  urlLink Michelle Malkin's blog .  This young, exceedingly effervescent, conservative Filipino-American (in case you are not familiar with the name) is a syndicated columnist, Fox News contributor & author (do read:   Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists Criminals & Other Foreign Menaces to Our Shores  -it'll make your blood boil) - and rocks on so many levels.  I just learned that she has a blog from Frank J. at  urlLink IMAO  (a cool conservative blogger who is very funny) - thanks Frank!  Her blog even has a blogroll!

      Here are some interesting articles on a variety of topics which you might enjoy.   urlLink  Metro Fare Woes  .  For us denizens of the DC underground, this is not good news - they're raising fares again. Let's see if they can actually get most of the escalators working at one time...or if the cash will end up in someone's pocket.     urlLink Vaclav Havel on North Korea  .  Former president of the Czech Republic weighs in on North Korea & what freedom-loving nations should do about it.  The impatience in me says "nuke it from orbit"; the residual idealism in me says as the great and free nation we are, we have the obligation of spreading democracy and freedom all over, my pragmatic bent says we gotta pick our battles.    urlLink Conjoined Twins' Saga  .  Is it my imagination or are there more conjoined twins being born?  How does this happen?  No, the article doesn't go into the causes, but chronicles the plight of two little girls & their family - get the Kleenex.    urlLink Comet Studies  .  Unanticipated findings about comets.  The universe is our oyster, let's go diving.    urlLink Fed Funds against Undocumented Criminals  .  $800k in Federal grant money is going to Arlington and Fairfax to aid efforts to incarcerate illegal aliens convicted of felonies.  Ok, it's not the whole tamale, but it's something.  I challenge any BHL (Bleeding Heart Liberal) to explain to me why we should tolerate illegal alien felons!      urlLink Good Karma  .  Woman donates kidney to stranger...then gets an unexpected winfall.  Who knew karma worked so fast?  Enjoy!

      Here's a  urlLink nifty reference  of foods with antioxidants from Woman's Day Magazine.  The great thing is none of them are esoteric, but totally accessible and you're probably eating them already. So go eat more of them!

      Interested in stock purchase to round out your investments but don't know how to get started?  More of a buy and hold type who doesn't want to put down gobs of cash to get into the stock market?  Check out  urlLink Sharebuilder.com , my Catch of the Day.  How it works:  you buy stock in dollar amounts, not shares, (and the amounts can be like $10) for a reasonable per-transaction fee or a subscription rate.  You can schedule a certain amount to be taken directly out of your checking account each month or schedule a one-time purchase.  You can do research about the companies right on the web site.  Note:  This is not primarily a service for "day traders," although you can make real-time trades; the fees are more reasonable for scheduled purchases - and the idea is buy-and-hold.  For the steady wealthbuilder, this makes sense.

      Here's sharing a few movie rental choices for the bored and antsy:  -  Ulee's Gold:   drama with Peter Fonda not playing a hippy or drugged out biker.  Has themes of redemption, forgiveness & bee husbandry.  Trust me, it's really good.  -  Drop Dead Gorgeous:   underrated comedy.  Kirsten Dunst, Kirsty Alley, Denise Richards.  Before you say "Gack," think "Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club" and go from there.   -  Clay Pidgeons:   quirky murder drama.  Joaquin Phoenix, Vince Vaughn, Janeane Garofalo.  When a good guy just can't come clean.  -  Pecker:   quirky comedy.  Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, Mary Kay Place.  Cool, oddball characters & great one-liners.  Ok, enough for now. Enjoy!

      I was just trawling for news stuff & came across this advertiser  urlLink link . Yep - you guessed it! It's an online dating service for conservatives.  Now, you know things are getting bad when one must go to a political specialty dating service.  Heh. But - on the other hand, if you don't want to bother dating scads of guys/gals only to find out that they're all libs, well then - I guess it saves time & money.

      The Catch of the Day today is the  urlLink USDA Graduate School website .  They offer all sorts of classes in the DC area (computer, languages, exam prep courses, etc) as well as some online courses at reasonable prices. I've been taking Spanish language courses there and really like it.

      This is where I'll recommend websites/blogs of interest. The Catch of the Day today is  urlLink Old Navy .  I just love their clothes & they're reasonably priced.  The site has a "bargains" page that sorts all the sale items.  One of the cool features is that you can put items into your shopping cart and come back the next day to edit it.  Plus, if the price has changed, it'll let you know that too.

      Warning:  I'm about to become new-agey philosophical here.  We were just watching a good episode of Angel (2nd Season) in which Angel has an epiphany about the importance of actions.  That is, that in the Big Picture sense, one's actions don't have much of an impact; yet paradoxically, our own actions are the only thing that really matters in the here and now.  So, to use an apt cliche, it's not the winning that matters, it's how you play the game.  Coincidentally, I've been coming to the same realization over the last few months.  Why be so caught up and obsessed about one's life its disappointments when that mode and its accompanying attitude doesn't result in anything positive?  Trust me - I know from whence I speak.  Be a good person, take pleasure in the small things, do random acts of kindness, connect with other good people. Yeah, there will always be nasty, rude folks of all sorts, but you'd be surprised how the rest respond to something as simple as a smile.  Even in this city!    In effect, it's all about the process & the journey.  Why not infuse something positive into that journey - which by the way isn't a solo, isolated one - why not create some positive energy?    What could it hurt?

      Check out this  urlLink Post article  on the health benefits of berries, a fine source of antioxidants.  Good explanation about the function of antioxidants (yes, Jeff, so you won't rust). Curiously enough Jeff & I have been buying strawberries & cherries like crazy this spring/summer - beautiful stuff at Fresh Fields.  I think this qualifies as a "Juicy Pulsating Candy" item.

      For those of you who don't live in the DC area, we currently have this street art thing - brightly colored, themed sculptures of pandas all over the city.  It follows a theme 2 years ago in which the sculptures were elephants and donkeys ("Party Animals," get it?).  I personally love it; it's something whimsical & fun in a city that takes itself far too seriously.    Today in the Post, though, was an article about damage done to some of these sculptures - stolen parts, graffiti & the like.  Keep in mind that individual artists created each piece - that it took time, effort & creativity to create them.  The article shows a picture of one of the artists whose piece was vandalized - she looks so forlorn.  I feel so bad for her and the others affected.  It really shows what kind of asshats (thank you, Rachel Lucas!) we have in this city - they can't just appreciate this fun thing and go about their business, they have to destroy, deface and ruin it for others.  Oh, and not mentioned in the article is that the graffiti (I observed) appeared to be in Arabic. Hmmm.    But here's the flip side - I observed a girl (young lady, woman, whatever) "examining" a sparkly panda on Conn. Ave. with the most amused smile on her face. Yeah, she gets it.  Here's the  urlLink full article  in case you're interested.

      "That which is especially good."  -  Angel, the series (DVD).   I've recently become a fan of the Buffy series, then partner-in-crime Jeff & I started watching Angel, the spin-off series.  Well, we're both hooked.  Angel has some of the same characters as Buffy, but the tone is darker. Yummy.  Also, they've given Cordelia some heft, character & strength.  Lots of fun demons (good & bad), vamps & EVIL lawyers.  Great one-liners, as you would expect.   - For the girls:   Almay Pure Tints (make-up).   Clear lip color plus SPF 25. Light, fresh, protective and inexpensive. How can you go wrong?   - Good oral hygiene:   Listerine PocketPaks (hygiene) .  The package says "oral care strips."  Bright, minty flavor kills onion breath in a flash - and so portable!  -  Green Tea (beverage) .  I'm totally sold on it.  Celestial Seasonings has a whole line of green tea blends.  Go to Fresh Fields/Whole Foods and puruse their wall of teas. Great for cold offices & when you want a pick-me-up, something better for you than soda, but none of the jitters & acidity of coffee.  According to one package, green tea has 25% the amount of caffeine in coffee.  Not into caffeine?  There's decaf too.  Now I'm trying the chilled green tea blends & I'll let you know which is worthy of "Juicy Pulsating Candy."

      If&nbsp;a person&nbsp;tried to poison another, society would deem this criminal and incarcerate the poisoner; however, smokers poison themselves regularly and systematically, fight for right to do so, and&nbsp;to impose that poison on others.&nbsp; Ponder this.

      Do you ever wonder how some folks can justify all sorts of bad behavior and failure by blaming it on others?&nbsp; And why others reinforce that abdication of responsibility, thus perpetuating it? &nbsp;I do - all the time - and get really pissed about it.    Personal Responsibility!!! &nbsp; As infants we are incapable of making decisions, but I'd say by earlier than age 15, we know that choosing to filet the neighbor is wrong.&nbsp; One doesn't "just get pregnant,"&nbsp; there are choices before the fact.&nbsp; If I'm not happy in my present situation (job, life, etc), it's not the fault of my parents, society, liberals, The Man, name-your-own-scapegoat;&nbsp; the onus to change my life and have some satisfaction is on me.&nbsp; Things done in a drunken state are not justifiable because of that drunken state.&nbsp; You get the picture.&nbsp; With the exception of the random acts of God, a person chooses his or her destiny thru a series of smaller choices.   So, it is odious to me, the liberal belief that a person is only a sum of his/her environmental influences and cannot be held accountable for those choices.&nbsp; And further, that the rest of us must bear the responsibility for&nbsp;the wellbeing/sustenance of that person - no matter what&nbsp;they've done, no matter if we would never have made those choices.&nbsp; And that we must&nbsp;never question any of the person's subsequent choices&nbsp;nor&nbsp;object to our forced support of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in this view is the belief that we the people are not to be trusted to make our own decisions regarding our own earned income - basically everything has to be legislated and social programmed to death - because government knows best.   I realize this is a rambling rant, but you understand of which I speak, no?

      The now-defunct Chris Carter series,  Millennium , just came out with the first season on DVD.&nbsp; Jeff bought it and we've been watching a few eps per night.&nbsp; For the uninitiated,  Millennium  was the second series by C.C. (the first being  The&nbsp;X-Files ).&nbsp;&nbsp;It's about this guy Frank Black, former FBI, who&nbsp;has&nbsp;the "gift" of being able to see thru the eyes of killers when he's in the proximity of their victims.&nbsp; He uses&nbsp;this talent doing "consultant work" with a group of former law enforcement folks called the Millennium Group.&nbsp;   The series, at least in the first 2 seasons was DARK, DARK, DARK and CREEPY.&nbsp; And we fans liked it that way.&nbsp; Where else can you get "what ifs" about serial killers, religion, conspiracies, the apocalypse, angels, demons, etc, etc?&nbsp; In how many series are they willing to kill off main characters in the first season?&nbsp; Then, in the 3rd season, they tried to lighten it up & brought in a new partner for Frank.&nbsp; Can I just say BAD DECISIONS?&nbsp; The show lost its cred & was eventually cancelled anyway.&nbsp; So, if you are at all interested, see only the first 2 seasons.

        Warning:&nbsp; Long Post!    For the longest time, I've been simultaneously career-wise coasting and angry/frustrated at my lack of career satisfaction.&nbsp; I've come to the conclusion that 1) given my interest in forensics and 2) my lack of a science background, I must go back to school as an undergraduate (full-time) and get that academic background, then proceed to either grad school or medical school to specialize and/or get a job in the field to acquire the work background end of it.&nbsp; So far, so good.&nbsp;   What's the problem, you ask?&nbsp; I mean, I already have an undergraduate degree & graduated with honors.&nbsp; I did well in a recent basic level Biology class.&nbsp; OK, so what's the what?&nbsp; Well, it's this little thing called procrastination.&nbsp; Completing the applications is no biggie...except for the essay and recommendations.&nbsp; It's partly about representing myself & my goals...perhaps that I doubt admissions staff will consider them "worthy" - not enough frills like&nbsp;community service, not the naive optimism of an 18-year-old, etc, etc.&nbsp; It's partly because as in all my writing, I agonize over every little word.&nbsp; It'll take me a week of revisions to finish a one-page essay.&nbsp; And the recommendations?&nbsp; I just hate having to ask people to say nice things about me.&nbsp; So I put off the whole thing, and put it off, and put it off.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I'm exactly where I don't want to be:&nbsp; getting older, dragging my ass to work every day, just about as motivated as you'd expect.&nbsp;   There's another task about which I've been procrastinating for about a year.&nbsp; In our apartment building there's a front-desk guy, David Young, who has always been super:&nbsp; pleasant, courteous, helpful in general &&nbsp;especially with a&nbsp;very specific problem we were having with our next-door neighbor last year. Now, I keep telling myself I must write-up a commendation letter to David's supervisor, singing his praises.&nbsp; I've even drafted a letter on my laptop.&nbsp; So, it's there, waiting to be completed.&nbsp; No biggie.&nbsp; Yet, the thing is not done.&nbsp; Now, this is just plain laziness.   Why did I choose to write  ad nauseum  about this problem today?&nbsp;  a.&nbsp; Self-therapy to examine one of my many issues  b.&nbsp; To talk  ad nauseum  about something, in print  c.&nbsp; To light a fire under my lazy, self-doubting buttocks  d.&nbsp; To share with others what must be a common malady  e.&nbsp; All of the above.   If you answered "e," you would be correct; however, "c" is the primary reason.   Remember (and I must too), you can't finish something if you don't start it.&nbsp; That said, don't let it go too long before jumping in again.&nbsp; Yeh, that and self-doubt keeps you in the parking lot.    Update 7/29/04 :&nbsp; Well, I shamed myself into action:&nbsp;&nbsp;I finished&nbsp;the commendation letter and&nbsp;delivered it! Yeah!&nbsp; One less item of guilt.&nbsp;

      Just finished reading  Toxin , a novel about a dangerous E. coli infection, by Robin Cook.&nbsp; I enjoyed it because it involves medical drama.&nbsp; You might want to read this together with a non-fiction "exposé" about the fast food industry,  Fast Food Nation , by Eric Schlosser.&nbsp; Interesting to read the fictional account of slaughterhouse operations and then&nbsp;compare it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the non-fiction description.&nbsp; Scary.&nbsp; Yet, still, I happily eat meat.&nbsp; Go figure.   Another (related) book I just finished which was really intriguing was  The Medical Detectives , by Berton Roueché, kindly given to me by a colleague, after noting my interest in such things.&nbsp; It's a collection of accounts of investigations, from the 1940s thru the 1980s, of all sorts of mysterious ailments and their resolutions (or not...).&nbsp; VERY interesting.&nbsp; My question&nbsp;is:&nbsp; &nbsp;how have treatments, diagnoses, methodology, technology changed/improved the chances of resolution since then, and how?&nbsp;

      There's yet another opportunity to thumb my nose at the French - Lance Armstrong wins the Tour de France again!&nbsp; This makes his 6th win & a record.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooh, the feeling of American superiority in a French event!&nbsp; Of course, major kudos to Armstrong for blowing away the competition!&nbsp; Read more  urlLink here .   Disclaimer :&nbsp; I don't actually despise all the French, just that arrogant & smug Chirac, his policies&nbsp;and all those anti-American, lefty&nbsp;boneheads yonder.&nbsp; Warm greetings and salutations to the roughly 250 French men and women who actually remember the 2nd World War & our&nbsp;timely assistance to their country.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      As I'm having a lame blogging week, I'd like to share a rant from my now defunct blog Big Stick Commentary (I like E.Z. better), which reflects my general outlook/mood at the time (last year).&nbsp; Now, I'm never going to believe in welfare, but my rants thereof may take a somewhat softer tone.&nbsp; Enjoy!  ----------------  Welfare on Wilson  Let's just say I'm not a big fan of the current (or any) welfare system. I do believe that I, as a person who pays lots of taxes because I DON'T have dependents (among other things), have no particular moral or ethical compulsion to support those who breed - just because they breed - and their unfortunate offspring. Unfortunately, the Feds & VA state gov't disagree. I go to jail if I don't pay my taxes. That said, you can just imagine how I feel about a pair of lard-ass individuals with the stroller attachments canvassing our very own Wilson Blvd for handouts. Both lovely fiance Jeff &amp; I have been accosted before and know them by sight. In fact, the other day, Jeff stopped dead in his tracks and said - "quick, we must cross the street." He had spied one such, and wished to avoid the whole scene...only to discover that her partner-in-panhandling was covering the other side! Now they have strategy! We passed by quickly, not allowing her to engage us. Let me just say that my loathing for welfare queens has found particular subjects. To wit, if I'm forced to shell out all this tax money for these morons, why the hell would I voluntarily give them MORE money?!!! What value are they providing us in return? Not raising the property values, let me tell you (not that that would help us anyway because we rent). Not making Arlington a more pleasant area through which to stroll. Not raising good self-reliant citizens - keep in mind that the kids in tow are observing all this - by which they'll grow to understand what is "normal and acceptable behavior." But, as usual, I'm accomplishing only one thing here - raising my own blood pressure. Females like them don't (refuse to) understand that having children is a choice, a personal responsibility and not a shared one at that. THEY made that choice (directly or by omission) and THEY are responsible for the wellbeing of their offspring. NOT ME, NOT JEFF. I feel sorry for the children, who don't have a choice in the matter, but giving their "mothers" money isn't going help the children in the long run - they're still in the same dysfunctional environment. Thus, we don't feel guilty about not enabling them to perpetuate their dependent behavior. And frankly, the thought of their demise really doesn't concern us - there will ALWAYS be more of their type, guaranteed.&nbsp;

      Days like yesterday should not happen too often.&nbsp; Horrible.&nbsp; No workout, lame blogging.&nbsp; Work, work, & last minute work.&nbsp; Irritating people.&nbsp; Missed deadlines.&nbsp; Unreasonable demands.&nbsp; Yuck.  Upon meditating on my experiences, I realized:&nbsp; you can't expect people to act other than themselves; therefore, it is useless to get angry or upset when they act exactly like themselves.&nbsp; What I&nbsp;mean by that is that if they were always likely to cave on what they previously said or promised in the past, it is futile to expect they adopt some gonads and stand firm (uh,&nbsp;heh) on their words.&nbsp; If they are unreliable and flaky in the past, chances are you can expect more of the same currently.&nbsp; To expect otherwise and become upset&nbsp;&nbsp;is doing yourself a disservice and won't change them one iota.  Ponder this as you encounter such boneheads today, and be at peace with yourself.

      Some general observations while in Key West:  &nbsp;  - Many of the dogs I saw down there were very fluffy, long-haired.&nbsp; Now, if you have temperatures in the 90s with high humidity for several months of the year, why would you have furry dogs - isn't that a bit sadistic?&nbsp; Those poor pooches looked  so  miserable!  &nbsp;  - Big surprise - the vast majority of folks (guests) at the resort were in really crummy shape.&nbsp; Soggy middles, big cellulite, thunder thighs, etc, etc.&nbsp; And not all those there were American - I heard some French &amp; German being spoken.&nbsp; Ha!  &nbsp;  - Many of the, um, "men"&nbsp;with the aforementioned "soggy middles" were strutting around like&nbsp;God's&nbsp;Personal Gift&nbsp;to Women. Huh?&nbsp; It was truly something.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  - The French family I noticed spoke only French and really loud.&nbsp; Or maybe it was just my&nbsp;rather negative&nbsp;attitude towards&nbsp;the French which&nbsp;made it  seem  like they were obnoxious...in my country.&nbsp; Heh. The German I ran into (not literally), only the other hand, was polite &amp; his English was very good.  &nbsp;  Well, there are all my&nbsp;observations for the time being. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Taxation.&nbsp; Now, I believe in paying my fair share for defense, roads, etc, but I strenuously object to the following: &nbsp;  - taxation only because they can, not because it makes any practical sense, and penalizing specific taxpayers. &nbsp;  &nbsp; The whole taxing of tuition benefits is an example.&nbsp; Most students who are taking advantage of this benefit don't have the financial wherewithall to go to school full time, so they take a more-than-likely underpaid job at a university to get tuition.&nbsp; Then they're taxed on money they never see.&nbsp; Thus drastically decreasing their take home pay.&nbsp; Try that in a city like DC, in which housing costs are thru the roof.&nbsp; You see the problem.&nbsp; Yes, initiative bad!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Also, car taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you've had federal and state taxes withheld from your paycheck.&nbsp; Then you paid sales tax on the vehicle.&nbsp; Then, you must pay a tax for the privilege of actually owning the car. Now, how is that fair?&nbsp;Is it any wonder that neither Jeff nor I own a car? &nbsp;  - taxation for yet another self-perpetuating social (engineering) program.&nbsp;   &nbsp; I have a big problem with government "charity" (ie, government shouldn't be in the charity business).&nbsp; We've observed what started out as a safety net for widows with children turn into a way of life for many.&nbsp; Then it became an entitlement, a right, that&nbsp;has, is and will be very difficult to dissolve.&nbsp; Part of that difficulty is that this ethic is passed on to the kiddies, whether thru stated teaching or observed behavior. &nbsp;  - "Robin Hood" taxation - taking from the rich to give to the poor.&nbsp;   &nbsp; Why is that in a society with great&nbsp;economic&nbsp;mobility possible, we find it necessary to punish the rich to&nbsp;give handouts to the "poor"?&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving money to folks doesn't make them any more&nbsp;likely to succeed financially; it makes them dependent on that handout.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forcing the better-off to give away&nbsp;larger portions of their&nbsp;earnings promotes a message that says - it's bad to have money.&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't that&nbsp;the American Dream to be financially successful &amp; secure, to rise to a higher financial station than what you started in, thru your own efforts and talents?&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; And who are these poor and why should anyone be forced to give them money?&nbsp; We as taxpayers are supposed to - at least in the liberal mind - give away our hard-earned cash without any regard or control over what these poor spend it - which could be more kids, drugs, luxuries (like TVs and other entertainment electronics), alcohol, cigarettes, etc, and without observable progress, results - specifically, less folks "needing" our money.&nbsp;  &nbsp; This hasn't been an exhaustive examination, but you get the picture.&nbsp; Taxation for governance, defense, and infrastructure - Fine, used pragmatically.&nbsp; Taxation for social engineering &amp; Nanny State support - BAD, BAD, BAD! &nbsp;   (to be continued)

      Ok, I don't know what's more irritating, wearing one contact lens or having to wear my glasses.&nbsp; Rewind, I&nbsp;abraded my cornea today - probably because I've been wearing my lenses too long - maybe 2 weeks straight.&nbsp; Ok, I've worn them 2 weeks straight before with no problem.&nbsp; I've had abrasions before.&nbsp; So I know it's no biggie, except it's just damn inconvenient.&nbsp; So, I think I'll wear my glasses for a day, but let me tell you, it's not fun going without peripheral vision - my prescription is -10.5 &amp; -12.0.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So, I'm just bitching.&nbsp; There was no particular aim to this post.&nbsp; See ya!

      Those who know me knew that I would be getting down to political business at some point. Here's the start... I choose the term "conservative" instead of "Republican" because so many so-called Republicans are just too liberal for my taste.&nbsp; Oh, and these are not in any particular order.&nbsp; Onward!  &nbsp;  You know I'm a conservative because:  &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;a barely controlled impulse to bitch-slap the next person (esp. female) who states proudly, "I'm pro-choice!"&nbsp; Now, what would that choice be, per chance?&nbsp; The choice to ignore the piles of contraceptives available in this country?&nbsp; The choice not to insist on condom use?&nbsp; The choice to be proud of something that involves the death of a helpless human being for convenience sake?&nbsp; The choice to flush your own flesh-n-blood and then whine about how tough the decision was?&nbsp; The choice to march in bonehead demonstrations for "women's lives"?&nbsp; Lookie here at some LOGIC - viruses are many times smaller than a sperm cell, so naturally any discussion of women's lives in this context would involve discussion of condom use to prevent HIV transmission, etc, which coincidentally would also prevent pregnancy.&nbsp; So...the whole abortion-RoevWade thing is moot.&nbsp; N'est-ce pas?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  And for the record, overturning RoevWade would not "outlaw abortion," it would result in each state deciding how they want to handle the issue.&nbsp; Oh, and I didn't hear&nbsp;a peep&nbsp;of you NOW types when Norplant was taken off the market.&nbsp; I guess that&nbsp;whole&nbsp;prevention thing doesn't "empower" you&nbsp;as much as destroying your fetus.&nbsp; My bad.  &nbsp;  And by the way, I'm not "Pro-Life" or "Anti-Choice" - I'm&nbsp;anti-abortion.&nbsp;&nbsp;No slogans, just description.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp; (to be continued...)  &nbsp;

      I've been terrible about updating my blog since back in town, so, feeling guilty, here are a few notes about our wonderful vacation:  &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; It was wonderful.&nbsp; I'm now a pleasant shade of brown &amp; look even healthier than before.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; Why can't I be there now???  3.&nbsp; Here are a few restaurants you should check out when down there:  -  Shula's on the Beach  - part of the resort at which we stayed - Wyndham Reach Resort.&nbsp; Kinda pricey, but&nbsp;great seafood &amp; steak - and a chocolate souflée that is TO DIE FOR.&nbsp;  -  Camille's  - Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner -&nbsp; comfortable, mid-priced restaurant with really good food (American)  -  Blue Heaven  - sit outside under Key lime trees and watch the chickens and roosters chase each other around.&nbsp; Very friendly service, good food, esp. brunch.  -  B's  -&nbsp; very inexpensive Cuban restaurant with yummy food, sangria, good strong coffee.  4.&nbsp; Tourist place you must visit:&nbsp;  The Butterfly Conservatory .&nbsp; It is an enchanting place with butterflies all around you.&nbsp; Sounds kinda lame, but trust me, it was well worth the trip; even Jeff was impressed.  &nbsp;  Ok, must justify my salary.&nbsp; More to come - reviews, rants, stuff.&nbsp; Have a smurfy day!  &nbsp;  PS/UPDATE: &nbsp; Jeff just reminded me of an restaurant oversight:&nbsp;  Origami  - a great little, cozy sushi place.&nbsp;  &nbsp; This and most of the above places are around the Duval/Simonton Streets area &amp; easy walking distance from both Wyndham resorts.

      Last evening, I spent the most peaceful, non-muggy hour on our balcony, just reading away.  Watched the sunset.  Drank a beer.  This is amazing because usually DC is nightmarishly hot and humid during August.  Really nice.  Then my sweet made buffalo meat tacos which were to die for! Yeah Jeff!

      Two articles caught my eye in the post today & quickly raised my blood pressure.    - The first one concerns a guy who wakes up in the middle of the night to find a drunken, naked immigrant (legal status unknown) on top of his 4-year-old child. DNI has only been in the country a short time & is already committing a felony.  Yes, open boarders, hurrah!  And the really nifty thing is we (as in, US taxpayers) will have to support this scumbag during his prison sentence...that is if he serves one! Read the whole story  urlLink here .  - The second involves a guy who leaves his 3-year-old daughter in a hot SUV for several hours.  She dies.  How many times does this have to happen before these uh, "parents" wake up and stop leaving their children in hot automobiles???  Unbelievable.  What morons actually think leaving small children alone anywhere is a keen idea?  Clearly more than one.  Read the whole story  urlLink here .  Arghhh!

      I took a fantastic spin class yesterday with my favorite instructor (who reminds me of Riley Fin from Buffy)...only to find out he's leaving after next week to go do something dumb like attend business school in the mid-west.  Wanker!    To be honest, the Thurs lunch class has this problem of having great teachers leave.  The last one before Riley moved to Africa for work.  A substitute for her has stopped teaching altogether.  Gaack!  Those of you have taken spin often enough to have a fave teacher feel my pain, I'm sure.  That's all on that.

      Although I have piles of tedious work to do before I leave today, and I really don't have time to blog, I did check out Frank J's (IMAO)  urlLink "Know Thy Enemy: Democrats"  and must post something on that.  It's hysterical if 1) you're a Republican and/or 2) you have a sense of humor.  Here's a taste: ---------- * No matter what legislation the Republicans propose, the Democrats call it "just a tax cut for the rich." When Republicans proposed to free the slaves, Democrats called it "just a tax cut for the rich."  * Many Democrats intensely hate Bush because it's easier than confronting the irrelevancy of their ideas. It’s funny to dump a bucket of cold water on them and hear them blame Haliburton.  * Democrats will often visit maternity wards and shake their fists angrily at all those who escaped the wrath of choice. ---------- Yeh, I needed a laugh today.  Go read the whole thing and tell me if you don't spew your coffee all over your keyboard, screen or cooworker!

      Support for Israel. I do. Hmmm. A stable (and US-friendly) democracy doing its best to survive surrounded by people who want to annilihate them, whose citizens live with the ever-present fear that today might be the day they'll be blown up while shopping for bread by some bonehead who thinks he's doing "God's work." Yep, Israel has my sympathy, for sure.  The Palestinians - oppressive "society" which brutally kills anyone who is even suspected of "collaborating" with Israel, whose leader talks enthusiastically about wanting to be a suicide bomber, yet never makes good on that promise (yeh, he leaves it to the 15-year-olds), who also hides stolen money in Swiss bank accounts, whose people teach Israel-hate in schools, whose moms raise their children to view suicide bombing as the preferred (if short-lived) career choice.  I truly don't understand how anyone can be sympathetic to these barbarians. Actually if there are a few peace-friendly-yet-afraid-for-their lives Palestinians, I have some sympathy for them.  The rest of them, buggers!  And that is all I have to say on that (yeh, fat chance)!

      ...More like, bitching on Monday, but would you expect any less from me?  I'm pretty certain I've paid for any sins I've committed (therefore, no need for continued Purgatory), I continue to "pay my dues" and thus, still dragging my bum into work day after day in order to pay bills.  That's how it feels. I'm getting too old to feel this way day after day.     Now, you can say, I'm also paying for vacations in Key West & you would be right; yet that's a fairly recent thing.  You also know part of the problem is my procrastination about applying for schools & my loathing thereof (applying, that is). Have not completed or started applications.  Boo-hiss. This will be an ongoing issue.  Well, I not only made gazpacho this Saturday, but then used the leftovers for a hot vegetable soup base on Sunday evening.  Both results were good, and I had enough left-over for lunch today.    Paid bills over the weekend.  Depressing.  So bringing lunch on a regular basis will become mandatory.  Nice if I could get to the concept of an emergency fund.  Not this month, though.   I started a major purge of old files and reorganizing by year.  Amazing how much I threw out, yet there is still substantial clutter and piles in our "study."  Realized we need a shredder.  I'm reading  The Bookseller of Kabul , which makes me immensely glad I'm an American woman. Gaack, how bleak their lives are in Afghanistan, even after the Taliban. Realized having too many options is infinitely better than having none, ever.  Realized once more today how much I despise meetings, folks who can't grasp the concept of deadlines, and folks who constantly call in sick, always when you need something from them. But, hey, I still have a job.  Realized in spades how much I hate being guilted into or about anything.  Enough on that.  Had a vision this morning of the Jeff & moi-meme having dinner out tonight.  Jeff shared this vision - yeah!  Going to take an accounting class (for work, on them) and a Spanish class (for fun, on me) in the fall.  It's something.  Read a commentary blurb in the Post today lamenting the CDC non-funding of several preventative AIDS programs for teens in DC. Questions:  where are the parents?  and why aren't they teaching their kids about such things? Is it the Fed's responsibility to tell the little angels to wear condoms so they won't catch a fatal disease?  I guess parents are too busy teaching lessons of perpetual victimhood, stupid virility, teen pregnancy and how to get the govts to pay for the little bastards.  Ok, enough - go read  urlLink the thing  for yourself and see what you think.   Back to work...

      Fresh Fields/Whole Foods Market used to carry a brand of chocolate called “Cloud Nine” which was produced in Israel. They had wonderful variations like dark chocolate with bits of peppermint candy, with dried tart cherries, with espresso beans. Having triangles of this chocolate with some good strong coffee was just pretty amazing! Not only an excellent product, but I get to support Israel.  Suddenly, though, they stopped carrying it. A major travesty. They have a web site, indicating that they're still in business - and actually coming out with new products. I zipped off an email asking 1) if they knew why FF/WFM stopped carrying them, and 2) where I could find their products around here. I'll let you know what I discover! I did find out that the company is environmentally positive (visit website  urlLink here ).  Speaking of chocolate, the other night I had a major choco jones and so Jeff & I went downstairs to Euro Cafe to get some. Being the label reader that I am, I perused the saturated fat content of some of the possible choices - big mistake! One Lindt variety had  14 grams of saturated fat ; 19 grams total!  Gaack!  And that was only for a third of the bar! We opted for an After Eight bar with 3.5 grams saturated fat per 1/3. Ignorance is bliss only if you eat celery for the rest of the day.

      There’s a poignant story in the Post today about a tragic automobile accident that critically injured a woman, Elizabeth Marchman, and killed her young son and pre-born daughter.  The loss to her and her family is heart-wrenching, but there is an uplifting aspect of this story.  The retired firefighters who pulled her from her burning car and 128 other community members all turned up to donate blood for her.  Not only that, but neighbors have established a fund to help cover Mrs. Marchman’s medical bills and burial costs for her two lost children.  It’s hard to be cynical when reading a story like this.  Her community rallied – took action – to provide tangible and needed help in this time of crisis.  Some of the donors waited two hours to give blood.  Shows there is some good in this world.
