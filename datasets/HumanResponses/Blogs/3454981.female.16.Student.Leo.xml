      I am confused...but believe me, it isn't the first or the last time I ever will be. How is anyone supposed to be able to interpret a person's intentions? I sort of wish it was like old times again, where a guy would send flowers to a girl that symbolized something like their intentions. And leading someone on could only last for so long. Or the simple angle of a fan could ask the questions you don't want to voice. And when at a dinner party, when a girl stood up, the guys at the table would even stop what they were saying and stand up as well---as a sign of respect and courtesy and downright sweet chivalry.   So I have decided to dedicate today's post to all I know about the language of flowers; if anyone actually reads this, then this is a message for all you guys(if any):  Flower language= brownie points w/ any girl message for girls: tell your boyfriend or whoever about flower language.

       "It was a year. Not a good or bad year, but it was a year. It was the best of times; it was the worst of times. I forgive you for beating on me after I accidentally knocked your folder on the floor, spilling all the alphabetized papers. No matter how much I apologized, you continued to beat me senseless. I still have the scars. Also, don't forget my manliness.  This sentence has no meaning. Nor does this one.  Pointless space  And they lived happily ever after. THE END?                                555-9897*                 Cheech"   Today, in school, I passed around my yearbook to various friends of mine. Although I only have about 10 signatures at this point in time, I think that out of this year (and all other years of my schooling which are very many) that this was the best thing anyone has ever written in my yearbook. It's riddled with many somewhat pointless inside jokes and makes light of the situation at hand. The school year is over, he wants me to call him...but that's also another inside joke for another day's explanation.   *Number changed for privacy.     By the way...                                   +The End+                                +For the moment+

      I loved the Ataris for a long time, then sort of got sick of them, but this song is one I haven't gotten sick of. By the way...the fetus thing in the side bar, don't worry I'm not a psycho kind of person, I just thought the whole emo thing was kinda funny.

      I just found someone else's blog who seems to have them same the same philisophical thoughts/needs/whatever as I do. Here's the link:  urlLink more(of)_me   The only difference is that as much as he loves God, I am just as angry at Him. For some reason when I say that, it really hurts--you would think that with as much anger as I have at Him, I wouldn't care. But the funny thing is that I do. My life has been total wreck for a while and only about six months ago did I pick myself back up again and brush of the dust. I don't understand. I had faith like a child, you know, the faith of a child that can move mountains; the kind of faith that trusts God no matter what. But three years ago almost everything I once knew went down the drain, and for six months I persisted, I was determined to trust God no matter what. But then something happened and I felt betrayed. I won't go into details right now, if ever, for there are too many painful memories. Too many times I would rather forget. But that's when I really sighed and closed my heart. At first I talked to Godly people who had previously been my mentors and they told me to read the book of Job. I read it, re-read it, and then re-read it again. I thought that maybe God was just testing my faith at a very young age. But after six months I gave up. Around this time my parents joined this bible study called Bible Study Fellowship. I believe it to be the worst thing ever created to be supposedly Christian. You see, one of the worst things my parents did to me will stay with me forever and when someone has done something horrible to you, you despise everything they love, even yourself. Thus I began to despise God. That is what really triggered it, but the events afterward only futhered my dislike. I feel like a horrible person after saying all of this. And although I didn't put very many details in it, I still feel like I have told too much. Thank goodness no one actually reads this.  I feel like the most horrible, idiotic, ignorant person at the moment.  Maybe it's not just a feeling... Maybe I  know  I am.

       Mr. Brightside --The Killers I just love this song right now! And Brandon Flowers is also really really good looking ; ) Don't worry I loved their music even before I knew what he looked like--I'm not that superficial about my music.

      This is disgusting. The whole thing about how keeping with that same decision about porn on the internet would technically be violating people's rights to free speech--it's just wrong. I understand how  technically  it would be violating free speech, and I know that if they made an exception about that then the whole U.S. government would go up in flames. But that's why it's disturbing. A society built upon who-knows-exactly-what that sees  porn (of all things)  as a part of freedom of speech. But I guess that's justice in some way or form. Thank goodness no one actually reads this because I don't understand half of the things that go on in the news. Well, I do understand all of it, but not on the level that I need to for Extemporaneous speaking. I understand it but I approach it in completely the wrong way--I approach it morally instead of analytically which makes me even worse at extemp. So that goes for one of my faults...Maybe I'll make a list. Didn't someone once say that as soon as you recognize your faults, you can address them; once you address them, you can overcome them? Or not...but it makes sense to a certain degree (I think...) Ok, so that's another one of my faults--I'm indecisive when it comes to things that I don't want to feel stupid about.  So here it goes (so far for today):  1. I address things morally instead of analytically 2. I am indecisive for fear of sounding stupid/uniformed 3. I am so shy that I can't even answer the phone/talk on the phone  By the way... Here's the address for the article that I was talking about (for some reason the link wasn't working): www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/29/scotus.web.indecency/index.html

      "Winning Days" by The Vines This song is strange for me--it brings fragments of supressed memories from my early childhood to me when I listen to it, some of which are a bit disturbing (but that's for another day, another time). But I love it anyway, it's a great song.

      I have so many questions right now for everything. I know everything, or so I have been told for these past few years, but I've found that I know nothing. Yes, nothing. I know nothing at all. All I can figure is that I am so far from knowing. Just plain  knowing --nothing in particular. Now I am just going to ramble on about everything right now, so bear with me.  Why do I only get used by people? Or at least have so many people trying to use me? One girl I know claims that I'm her best friend in the whole entire world but then all she does is vent to me about her guy problems and etc. One time she told me about how she was so upset that only 3/4 of the people she invited to her party were able to come. And I wasn't invited. Her "best friend in the whole entire world" wasn't invited. I was kind of upset so I told her, thinking maybe that she slipped up and forgot to invite me--and she said right to my face that she didn't want to.

      The house is empty--finally. I am so sick of people fighting, but at least now they're out for a bit so I can breathe without being accused of "taking sides" with someone. Another + is that they're gone so now I can finally write here. I have not been able to write for so long because whenever I wanted to, someone was always looking over my shoulder. But anyway... News is as follows: My youth group leader is suddenly leading. I haven't been to youth group in a long time, but he suddenly decided that "God is calling me elsewhere" I am so mad at God for a lot of things right now... I gotta go...my family's home :(

       I officially hate the dentist :(   He decided that he was going to try out a "new method of novacaine" but elected not to tell me until afterward. so i have devised this equation           crazy dentist    +   "new method of novacaine"   +   one clueless person (me)    =    two days of that feeling like he just ripped out all of my bottom teeth, aching gums, one crying me, and a two-day migraine that the likes of has not ever been seen on earth until now.        ho hum. that was my complaint for the past two days.      oh, and I cut my finger on an ear of corn yesterday :(  for an ear of corn, it left a pretty deep cut. I guess it's like a battle wound ; )   yeah, never make me shuck corn when I have a headache. I tend to get a little upset. haha--that was so understated. I know it's pathetic. for one, who lives near to Chicago and still shucks corn? I do. That's what happens when you have a road that runs through your town called Hicks Road. Just kidding...I was at my grandmother's house who lives a couple towns over and so I was shucking the corn for a family dinner.      The kitchen was just re-done in our house and it looks so nice. Like it's out of a magazine. I'll have to get a picture and put it up here. Other good news is that I can now put the computer on the desk in the kitchen at a normal height instead of wasting away on my knees in the living room typing at a coffee table. That was the most uncomfortable place to type.      Oh, another complaint (I'm in a sort of bad mood)    Today I was sleeping because I had this headache and no medicine works...but anyway my older sister came back from doing this fund-raiser car wash at the highschool with a couple of friends. it was her best friend and her best friend's brother and her best friend's brother's friend named Artie. Got all that? Basically she came home with one girl and two older guys. They decided that they all wanted to jump on the trampoline in our backyard and put the sprinkler on. But Artie didn't want to get his khaki pants wet so my sister asked me if Artie (who I assumed was a girl with a bad nickname cuz they all have weird nicknames for eachother) could borrow my shorts because I'm taller and therefore have longer legs. So she let this guy borrow a pair of my shorts!!! Yeah they were my soccer shorts but they're still rather feminine. But that made me mad.      goodness gracious how petty this all sounds. Well I guess I should go before I show myself to be a complete idiot.      +song of the day:   somewhere only we know by Keane. click on the title to go to their website. if you don't know who Keane is-then go find out! always great music from them. and it seems to me that they're coming to Chicago on September 19 (and Snow Patrol is coming the next day!) Anybody want to come with me? haha...seeing that I have two readers on here I know it's a hopeless cause :'(

         today (& this week) has been (&amp; will be) a sad week for me. it's kind of happy because my trip to New York is coming up, but with this coming week, it will be the last time I see him.&nbsp;I think it will be the&nbsp;last time I ever see him&nbsp;for the rest of my life. it's not a very comforting thought...but I guess I deserve it. Sometimes I think I have seperation anxiety.Though I guess everyone does to a certain extent. But I will miss him, ever so much. I apologize  for being very vague, but I'm *still* afraid of someone I know finding this and laughing at me. i'll just miss him a lot...    again, I   am having another pity party! i really need to stop this...      &nbsp;   I've written 8 songs in the past few days. Even with harmonizing vocals &amp; guitar parts. Saddness is my #1 muse...I just wish happiness could be my '#1 muse' instead.         Song of the day: Such Great Heights by The Postal Service       +great song. gotta love it. if you've never heard it then you should! So click on the title and go to their site and download a song of theirs. or go   urlLink  here    and watch their music video.      ♪neutiquam erro♪    (i think this is latin for 'i am not lost' but I have been neglecting my studies for a while...eeks!)

       Take Me Away(Amsterdam Concert Version)&nbsp;by: Lifehouse    &nbsp;  This song is good but the live recording (I&nbsp;know it's sort of an oxymoron) from their concert just sounds cool because it's just them & no special computers fixing the sound &amp; no voice-overs.   I don't like voice-overs. It kind of seems like cheating or something...just to me, that is.   So I like this version of the song.

                Alright, here is the list. Are you sure you're ready because it will sound   very   basic and probably extremely stupid/childish. But I guess I should just get this over with...some of these questions I know the answers to, some of them I am really wondering about.      Oh, and if some of these are sort of like 'what is the meaning of life' then don't worry about having to answer.     &nbsp;   1. Why did God create humans&nbsp;if he knew&nbsp;that not all of us would make it to heaven?    2. What did I do to suddenly feel like I was deserted? (like He's probably still there, but I don't feel as close)    3. What about Evolution? I don't believe in macroevolution, but did God create microevolution so that we and the things around us could adapt? Because scientific evidence shows that things have adapted...ok this probably was not a fair question seeing as I almost positive that no scientist or whatever reads this blog.     4. Why were we created?     5. Humans will probably never be capable of understanding at any level, but I will always wonder how God came to be. Well, not be, how He  is.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  There are so many other questions I have, but I'm drawing a blank, so I'll have to post them on here later.

         song of the day:  A Decade Under The Influence by Taking Back Sunday   &nbsp;   My day was much happier than this song is, but I love the way&nbsp;pre-chorus/chorus sounds :)       I'm not much of a TBS fan these days...they were good when they were a little band but now they're not as little and not as good to me.       By the way...the intro to their site (as in their newest cover to their CD) is a bit shocking. Who thinks the naked baby thing is cute and/or relevant? Not me...

       urlLink     c'est moi&nbsp;  urlLink        &nbsp;  I needed to send this pic through Hello so I could put it in my profile.   Oh, how I hate pictures! I'm not very photogenic at all. Either I end up looking&nbsp;absolutely stupid or extremely mad about&nbsp;something. Luckily this picture just makes it look like I'm mad about something instead of looking stupid---or I could look stupid and mad in this picture.   Oh well, I guess this is a *major* step (lol yeah right) because I've always been afraid of someone I know finding this blog and then knowing 1/4 of everything that I think about daily instead of knowing nothing. Here I am rambling on again... I must shut up and think for a while...    &nbsp;  Darn...   I just realized that I look strikingly similar to&nbsp;a deer in the headlights. Ah, life!

        [glare]*scoff*  little girl? [/glare]    alright...so maybe I  do  feel/act like a little kid, but did you have to  notice?     By the way, I have a feeling that you're not much older than me mister! ha! am I right?        &nbsp;    just kidding...I guess it's nice to know that someone "reads up" on this blog once in a while, especially when I have questions. Yes, I've tried talking to Him, then after a while I gave up and tried listening...but it feels like I still can't get through. I know it's most likely me who's letting  Him  down, but I don't know what else I'm supposed to do. I just went on a rock climbing trip with my youth group and during worship time at about midnight I would just look straight up and just  feel  His presence, but when I just waited it felt like it vanished. Yeah, I probably blame Him for a lot of stuff that He doesn't deserve to be blamed for (goodness gracious! You catch on to things far to quickly. Maybe I'm just hopelessly obvious or something...)I just have a ton of 'why' questions. I won't plague you with them but&nbsp;I do have an&nbsp;awful lot of them. Probably a huge reason that I've become so lost&nbsp;or whatever is that no one can answer my questions. Well, beside the Bible, but sometimes I want to ask questions that I already know the answers to. Do you know what I'm saying?     Thanks for answering my question, it really helps to know that pretty much the only person that reads this blog besides me has what seems to be a very good relationship with God. Maybe that's where I could begin to see His hand in my life again because out of the millions of people/blogs&nbsp;on the internet, a Christian found my blog.    Sorry for talking so much but thanks. It helps to type things out.

         it  's about 85 degrees farenheit outside but i've closed myself up inside the house without air conditioning because i'm    freezing      :( i think i'm sick i may even&nbsp;have a fever...but i'm home all alone tonight...too tired to get up to get the thermometer...but not to tired to type ;) never too tired for this.       the song that best describes  the day today is Run by Snow Patrol. i know i've alrady done this song as a song of the day before...but it just is the music that  is  my day, if you know what i mean. aww...i wish they would come to Chicago sooner :( they're coming to Chicago on September 20 at the Metro---that's exactly one month after my birthday! maybe i can convince my parents that i am old enough to go with just friends---you'd think at my age that they would give me some room to breath but they don't. grr...but i won't get into that now...i'm too tired.    i'm a little depressed today. i miss talking to people--even people i don't know. i wish i had someone to talk to.    ------>gosh i forgot how much&nbsp;i love this song. here are the lyrics to "Run" by Snow Patrol (watch the music video off of their website if you've never heard it):     I'll sing it one last time for you/Then we really have to go/    You've been the only thing that's right/In all I've done

       back from the rock climbing trip. For the most part it was awesome, the only parts I didn't like was that one kid on the trip complained the entire time and also that my sleeping bag somehow didn't make it to Wisconsin with us. I guess one good thing is that my mother says that I've lost weight and that now my skin is "just glowing"   *rolls eyes* goodness gracious I didn't lose weight, she just wants to imagine that I am a size 4 again--which, by the way, would make me...oh let's see, 50 lbs underweight for my height! She means well, but I am just far too tall to be    that    small. And as for my skin "glowing" I didn't get any sunburn or tan at all---but I suppose my skin looks like it's glowing (glowing white, perhaps) when&nbsp;she haven't seen me in a while. I really do need to put a picture on here of myself, but I'm just a bit afraid of people finding out that it's me. As I said before, I've found people from my high school on Blogger too--eeks! But enough of my talking for now because I really need to work on shortening my posts on here since the last few just dragged on forever without me even saying much.

         I am totally not a Maroon 5 fan at all, but I thought this song was very sweet in light of the circumstances. I wish I had a friend that would say "Tap on my window, knock on my door/I want to make you feel beautiful/I know I tend to get so insecure/It doesn't matter anymore" ...nobody will talk&nbsp;to me anymore except to ask for advice.     Seriously, no one will talk to me except when they're in trouble and need advice. For some reason people tend to think I have good advice--too bad I don't have any for myself. Somedays, well, most days, ok fine  everyday  I want some one to talk to or just go somewhere with&nbsp;(just so I can get out of this damned house!) &nbsp;  (  Oh no, my vocabulary is failing me! I cannot express myself enough in words so I have used a swear out of pure frutration!) but they're all too busy with their own lives to have time for me--except if they have one crisis or another and&nbsp;need to talk&nbsp;to me.&nbsp;I would even be content to listen to something other than problems; for example, talk about music or guitars or whatever.   goodness, I've gotten carried away...Because of this song now I'm turning into a hopeless sap so I apologize...gosh this is embarrassing...i never thought a 'band' like maroon 5 would be posted as a song of the day :/      She Will Be Loved  by Maroon 5     Beauty queen of only eighteen  She had some trouble with herself  He was always there to help her  She always belonged to someone else     I drove for miles and miles  And wound up at your door  I've had you so many times but somehow  I want more     I don't mind spending everyday  Out on your corner in the pouring rain  Look for the girl with the broken smile  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved(x2)     Tap on my window, knock on my door  I want to make you feel beautiful  I know I tend to get so insecure  It doesn't matter anymore      It's not always rainbows and butterflies  It's compromise that moves us along  My heart is full and my door's always open  You can come anytime you want     I don't mind spending everyday  Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh  Look for the girl with the broken smile  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved (x4)      I know where you hide  Alone in your car  Know all of the things that make you who you are  I know that goodbye means nothing at all  Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls     Tap on my window, knock on my door  I want to make you feel beautiful     I don't mind spending every day  Out on your corner in the pouring rain  Look for the girl with the broken smile  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved(x4)    Please don't try so hard to say goodbye(x3)      I don't mind spending everyday  Out on your corner in the pouring rain     Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

        I'm going to put this in webdings so that people will really be forced to take the time to copy&amp;paste it into Word to figure it out. Then it will be certain that no one that I know reads it, even if they find it, because they are lazy :) just kidding. but this is by far the most stupid post I have ever written so I'm embarrassed. But if I erased it then all this typing would have been a waste of time. So copy &amp; paste if you want, but it's a total waste of time.       &nbsp;    I hate this. I know I'll be able to see him for the next few days, and next few weeks, but once summer is over he's off to New York. I hate college for that reason!  For taking him away. Because I know he'll do really well and I'm almost certain he'll become famous in one way or another , but that's why I don't want him to go. I know that once all that happens, he'll never come back, at least not to see me. It hurts to think that one day, that one person who you'll remember for the rest of your life might or will forget  you or that you even existed. It's the worst feeling in the world--to know that you're not good or pretty or outgoing or  old  enough for someone. Is 3 years really too much of an age difference? Perhaps if the love is not returned it does not make a difference at all? But  the worst feeling is especially when that someone had made you feel good enough, and you only find out that it was&nbsp;just how they were to everyone else. Don't  you hate when someone is just such a good person that you can't hate them but  love  them. But then you hate that they love everyone. I am so confused. I think I'm jealous. I think I want him to love only me, and the whole entire world will just have to  suffer--besides the rest of the world already is loved enough. No, I'm not    jealous   , I'm    selfish.    I think I should have a right to be selfish. Yes,  I do have a right to be selfish. No, I don't, because if I'm selfish then I'm really not    good enough for him because he is just always so right, and such a good person. I really do love him.

        I         don't know where this came from but this is it. It actually has a guitar part and it's become an actual song withing the last 10 minutes. Alright, so maybe I   do   know where this came from...or who it was inspired by...but you'll never know--because I am too afraid of people who know me finding this and figuring out what is really going on inside my head, or my heart for that matter. They just never understand. Ahh, the comfort of having a computer receive my thoughts and feelings about everything! An the confort of anonymity... a certain extent. The other day I found a blog of an upperclassmen at my highschool (eeks!) but I am just stalling now. Here are the lyrics--I wish I could record the song but the sound board is broken on my recording equipment and I am just too lazy to fix it even though I know how. Stalling again! Alright, here are the lyrics...finally:     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  I don't know what is wrong   I don't know what to say   I hate it when it hurts and the pain just won't go away     I was in love at first   Now I'm just sick of it all   Can't tell you why it hurts to be here all alone     (So)Can't you set me free?   Your&nbsp;kind words&nbsp;hurt my ears   I really should have left here years and years ago    &nbsp;  (But it's) Too late now   The inevitable strikes   I won't be here much longer   You won't be near much more than one year     (So)Can't you set me free   Oh, you've pain-ridden me   I hate the way is   Yeah, you're&nbsp;hearing it   I do hate this   Not you   Never you     What day it is tomorrow?   But what is that to me?   Your kind remarks just feed my sorrow   I'll never&nbsp;know where it ended between us   You can never be my own   No, not you   Never you    So can't you set me free   I'm in a cage of kindness   Hurt me outright so I don't love you anymore   So I can leave this place   No, not you   Never you   Never you   Never...

       I just came back from a wedding that I sang at with my chorus. It's funny how there can be a funeral one day, and a wedding the next. Alright, I'll forget the details because I want to get to the best part. My choir director and our piano accompanist sang a duet together and it was the most beautiful song I've ever heard. It was so beautiful that I almost cried--and I will cry&nbsp;later because I have the song permanently imbedded in my memory for what seems will be forever. I know that Celine Dion has done this song before and all those other singers like her, but&nbsp;those people&nbsp;could never do it any justice after what I just heard. It was just that amazingly beautiful. Here are the lyrics (but I wish I had a recording of their voices--it was seriously that amazing) :       The Prayer     I pray you'll be our eyes

         This is really sort of funny...if you really knew me you would know why. Well,&nbsp;I guess this blog has seen about 75% of my true character--which is a lot more than the rest of the world sees, so feel privledged. But anyway, this is my handwriting analysis results. It's funny because the vast majority of it doesn't quite line up with my character. But what do you expect, it was&nbsp;an    online   &nbsp;handwriting analysis. By the way...I really   ♥ love ♥   this new html color thing :)   &nbsp;   Here are the results:    Regarding letter size... you clicked "Medium". Because your writing is neither really large or small, then we know you are not as intense as those who write really small... nor are you as flighty as those on the other extreme. You fall into the middle-of-the-road on this character trait.    Slant reveals "emotional outlay". (How you react emotionally to the situations with which you're faced.) And Concerning the letter slant of your sample, you chose "Vertical". You use logical, sound judgments to make decisions. You're ruled by your head, not your heart. You tend to be calm, cool, and collected... and are good under pressure. In a situation where other people might get hysterical, you have poise.        Some may see you as "detached" or "unemotional". It's not that you don't feel emotions, you just have more discernment when and with whom to express your inner-most feelings. You also keep them inside longer than most people. (If your writing is very large, you can be very social, friendly, and talkative... but still emotionally logical.)  The first time someone makes you mad, you probably won't say anything. But, you'll mentally put a mark on the wall and keep your mouth shut until they piss you off again. Then, BOOM! You'll explode... all that pent-up anger comes pouring out! And, you won't feel any regret at all, because you know they deserved it.    This may sound harsh, but you're ruled by self-interest. In emotional situations you ask yourself, "What's best for me?" And, unlike many of us, you actually have the discipline to follow your logic... rather than your emotional whims.        In a relationship, you tend to show your affection by the things you DO rather than the things you SAY. The only exception is if your mate has expressed a need to hear "I love you" on a daily basis, then out of respect for your partner's needs, you'll verbalize your feelings.  Looking at the letter "i", you chose "i-dot is just about normal". This is a good trait to have, because it shows loyalty... a solid commitment to stand by those people or ideals in which you truly believe.    Oh boy... the letter "o"... this is a very insightful letter. When you picked "Exit loops on the right side", that told me you can be VERY secretive. As a matter of fact, the larger your inner loop, the more you tend to avoid giving complete and straight answers. You won't lie, but you won't offer information freely either. If your best friend shows up in an outfit that's absolutely hideous, and then asks your opinion, you might say something like... "How unique! Where did you get it?"        Excellent! When I asked about the shape of the tops of the humps in the letters "m" and "n", you chose "Vary between rounded and pointed". Your represent the best of two types of reasoning styles: The "cumulative" and the "comprehensive". You can process information both in a cumulative/procedural fashion... and also in a comprehensive/fast manner. The cumulative thinker likes to take the time to gather all the facts before forming a conclusion. On the other hand, the comprehensive thinker likes to see the big picture... without getting too deep into the details, and quickly form his/her conclusion. Because you can process information in both a cumulative/procedural fashion... or in a comprehensive/fast manner, you can easily adapt to the situation at hand. If you're with a cumulative thinker, you can slow down and explain every detail. If you're talking to someone who only wants the bottom-line, you can speed up your thinking, and shorten your presentation. This ability is critical to effective leadership.  This is an important trait! When I asked you how high the t-bar is crossed on the stem of the letter "t", you chose "Midway up the stem". This tells me that you set goals that are realistic, practical, and obtainable. Also, that your self-esteem is good... but not so high as to make you over confident.    People that cross their "t's" in the upper middle are pragmatic and secure with themselves. You have the confidence necessary to make changes in your life that would improve your situation. Keep growing and stretching!        When I asked you if the first letter of your signature was smaller than, or equal in size to the other letters, you indicated that it was. This shows that you have a tendency to be modest and humble. You prefer to blend into the crowd... rather than stand out. This isn't necessarily a bad trait. However, ego is an important component of your self-image. So don't always take a back seat!.  People with larger capital letters in their signature tend to demand more attention and have a stronger sense of self-importance. There are times when this is appropriate and very important.    You checked that your signature was underlined. This shows that you are both self-reliant, and yearn to lead others. You aren't afraid to draw attention to yourself and take charge. You have confidence in your own abilities and inner strength. Hats off to you!

        urlLink   This     is by far the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life besides the   urlLink   Aicha video       The funniest thing is that I am 'classified' as emo to everyone that knows me, but I don't classify myself as anything. But I guess if I had to, I wouldn't mind being labeled as emotional cuz that's a&nbsp;natural thing, to be emotional--right?hehe :)    &nbsp;I'm kind of into finding the good little bands out there that no one knows about and then when everyone finds out about them, &nbsp;I've already got&nbsp;a signed T-shirt or their EP which has been recently discontinued. *smiles* it makes you feel special, or smart. But anyway...I love how this site has    typical    emo people "figured out" like down to the pins worn on pants or even the dirty little secrets. It's funny, because I don' think any person can be typical. They can try to be, but generally never succeed.     Well, this is my    lighter side    observation of the day compared to my last post.      &nbsp;     Oh, and before I forget...the song of the day is     "Letters To You" by: Finch       + one of my old favorites :)    &nbsp;

       ...when will it ever end? Perhaps my allergies have suddenly changed, but I think I am getting sick. My throat is so sore! But that's not the least of my troubles&nbsp;at the moment. Today I had to attend a funeral. I hate funerals but then again, who does like them? This one was for the grandfather (to some of them he was a father) of a family who is friends with our family.&nbsp;I never really met him but he seemed like a really fun guy. They&nbsp;had pictures of him  everywhere , but they also had an open casket during the visitation time. That is the part of funerals I hate the most--when people die, they are gone.&nbsp;No matter what&nbsp;religion you are or you practice it is commonly known that basically the soul of someone is gone, and so is any remnant of life. So what is the use of trying to make them look like they're living? I know this sounds very cold and heartless, but I too, have had many relatives die--especially within the last 2 years and I know it's tough.&nbsp;However, filling them with formaldehyde and trying to make them look like they were is really pointless. They are not like they were before&nbsp;because they are not living. But I guess I know deep inside that people do need to have that last glance at a loved one so they can really 'let go' so to speak. I just hate how it is after someone dies. I am not afraid of dying, but&nbsp;I do hate the lingering&nbsp;aura of death. My thoughts are too contradictory that I&nbsp;think I will&nbsp;resume writing later.&nbsp;

      Tonight I went to a concert at Navy Pier in the Beer Garden--go figure. I saw The Redwalls!!!! I &#9829; The Redwalls! It was awesome. Not enough people know about them so there was probably at most, I'd say 35 people but only about 25 were close to the stage. This enabled me to get to about where the 2nd or 3rd row would be, had there been seating. I could have gotten closer, but I realized that they would be able to see me best from the 2nd or 3rd row area and I was right :) Justin saw me and waved (and later on winked! I guess I was smiling a lot) :) And Logan saw me and pointed and winked ;) After the concert I had them all sign a T-shirt that said "THE REDWALLS" on it and it was really fun. Ben (the drummer) was dripping with so much sweat and his hands were shaking but he managed to sign it just fine. Andrew (guitar, some vocals) signed it and has a cool signature. Then I went over to Logan and he was sitting down at a table and when I had him sign it, he winked and said "here you go, my dear." and smiled. I almost died :D LOL only because my friend was VERY jealous because he didn't say anything to ANYONE else but me :D idk it made me feel special because all the girls there were wearing clothing that was far too revealing and I was the only one there in a T-shirt and jeans who wasn't actually expecting attention. That never happens because I am usually the "ugly one" according to some rather rude people. People say I have very pretty eyes and very white skin and very dark hair (yes, the cartoon character I am most similar too is Snow White) but then they're all just trying to get to my older sister who is a blue-eyed tanned-skin brunette lifeguard. Yeah, I am generally cast in her shadow because we are nearly exact opposites. But this time she wasn't with me so I was not being compared :) There have been very few times in my life that I have felt pretty or at least that my personality was "good enough" to actually be noticed. I kind of like that feeling. But anyway, so many tangents....so little time. Hmmm...I'll have to make that into a T-shirt some day... But overall today I was having a very bad day until I went to the concert. And now I feel somewhat special, so I think I shall go off and dwell on pleasant thoughts.  *sigh*

      So I kind of gave up after only a bit of typing due to my realization that my hard copy of the fairy tale is about 9.5 pages long (double sided!) and plus I became lazy. So that is the reason for the abrupt ending, and if you don't like it you can write an ending yourself and post it as a comment! Actually, that would be very much a fun thing to do because it would be a bit like Mad-libs or those choose-your-own-adventure books(series) Goodness, I must be going insane with summer boredom! Well it's not that long until August---right? Summer is my favorite season, well, I love all seasons but summer is the most freeing time of year for me. Except this year I feel like an animal in a cage. The only thing I am getting out for is a singing mini-tour in New York from August 5-9 and then this coming saturday I may go see The Redwalls in concert! And that's it. Oh, and my birthday is August 20th, but who knows if anything special will happen this year. I had a suprise party last year, but they're a bit overrated (sp?) especially when your mother palns them. *Sigh* *Another sigh* I really need to get out--maybe I'll go somewhere and spontaneously make new friends!..........yeah right, who am I kidding--if I can't even talk to someone I've known all my life on the phone then how can I ever spontaneously make friends with random people face-to-face? Well, there is that certain excitement about making an impression--whether it's good or bad. I am writing so much today! I think I really must be going insane or at least I'm experiencing withdrawl of not even being able to use AIM & IM people kind of like a real face-to-face conversation. That brings to mind the fact that I have not had an actually meaningful conversation with someone in a long time...actually since school ended and my Critical thinking/"gifted" class in high school ended. I miss that class. I think I had probably the most amazing/brilliant/fun/kind teachers in the world with whom you could have the most philosophical conversations with just as soon as you said hello to them. Even people in my gifted class, some of them were like that, it was like there was a deeper understanding that just a meaningless conversation. I like that, especially when you can't really describe something amazing that you realized (like time & relativity & such things as those) and they can still understand but on a much deeper level. I love that--and I'm glad that I'll be seeing most of them next year.  Wow, as I read over this I come across as selfish and an unecessary banterer (if there is such a title). My humble apologies, and I hope you do not think this how I really am. I just need to vent a bit. But this is too much I'm writing so I will save the rest for my written journal and spare all of you (and conserve space)

      So here I am eating a bar of Hershey's chocolate because we all know that  urlLink chocolate makes us feel better and is healthy!  But moving on...  I don't know why I titled this 'entry' like that, it sounded good though--like it has a bit of a ring to it. Anyway, I wanted to post this "fairy tale" that I've been writing. Mind you, it still doesn't even have proper punctuation or sentence structure and it still needs a lot of work (so don't laugh at me! I know it's stupid!) but I figured that typing it out would help me to process it and manage to keep it organized...I hope...so here it goes.  Once upon at time that was not so long ago, in a place not too far from the reaches of our imaginations there lived a small girl. She had been in world not much longer than five years, but was as every bit the wise for it. Everyday she would clean the house until five hours past the midday sun. While all the other children played games in the streets she would diligently attend to her duties. It didn't help that her family was elsewhere "making money" or playing cards. But despite these things she was always able to finish cleaning by the time the sun had been past the top of the sky for some time. It was at this very same time, before the market closed, that the little girl had to run errands and get the food for the next day. Now that you feel perfectly sorry for her and pity her, I must tell you that this has all been a fabulous pity party, and still the girl is none the better for it. She was actually a perfect brat and pitied herself even more for it. Yes, her family were jerks, but she was as well. That's the end of the story and don't you go asking where the fairies or the fairy godmother were--it's no use.     FINIS

       "The more I see of the world, the more I am dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense."  --As said by Elizabeth Bennet in  Pride and Prejudice    This is the second time I have read this book and I have found it just as educational as the first time. Disregarding the whole "prospects of marriage" theme in the book, I feel that there is an important piece that cannot be ignored. It already deals with the word right in the title:  prejudice   I am almost 100% sure that everyone else must have already figured this out way back when they were 7 years old or something, but I feel like I have never quite understood it until this past year. People probably base 75-85% of their thoughts of people on daily observations or little meaningless/worthless bits conversation. People are prejudiced against (about) others for absolutely no right. No one knows what goes on in the other's head. For example, for the past two years most people at my school think I am very prideful and haughty and such a "know-it-all" just because I am shy and my brain retains information differently (well, strangely is more like it--but that's another story for another day) than most people, or anyone they know for that matter. I mean I am extremely shy--I can't even talk on the phone with people because I don't know--I just can't. But anyway...just because I am shy and maybe have just a bit above average intelligence doesn't make me any less nice of a person, or any less of a person at all.  So this is my confused writing of the day...decipher what you can; guess at what you cannot understand.  Comment if you please. I am curious to know what anyone else thinks.

Even though some people say that they are on their way to 'selling out' I still love them :) ♥○♥○♥   click on the title to go to their website and listen to the jukebox if you've never heard of them. and if you have, but you've only listened to songs like "Punk Rock Princess" then you are totally missing out. All of  their other songs are 20 times better. I love the piano with it all♥

       ...with too many thoughts circling my mind. for the first time in 6.5 years I did not wake up at 5 AM. I actually slept in until 11:11 AM and now I feel sick : \      So today I'll tell you a few select thoughts that are racing around my mind trying to make as much sense as possible (as always).   By the way, I'm having a bit of trouble tyeping today because while I was making my little brother (he's 11) some macaroni and cheese I burned my hand on boiling water. so i apologize for any typos.      Anyway...while I was in New York I saw two broadway shows, one of which was Aida. If you don't know the story line then here is a brief synopsis:    urlLink Aida    So that synopsis wasn't exactly brief but it is shorter than every single detail.       Of the three broadway shows I have ever seen, so far it is my favorite by a landslide. Besides the reincarnation stuff which I don't believe in but brought closure to the whole story, it was amazingly beautiful. Let me first admit that I am secretly a hopeless romantic. Just kidding...idk what I am classified as but this love story made me cry at the end. Combine any good (sad) story with beautiful music and you'll probably be able to get me to cry. But it was REALLY REALLY REALLY good. Even better was that it was based on a true story. That fact alone makes me start to cry a little bit. It was just that awesome. In the beginning few numbers I didn't like the music very much but it got better. Deborah A. Cox and Adam Pascal were both amazing so it added to the whole effect in the end. I don't know what it is about this story that it just makes me envy people in love. I know, I know, I'm too young to care (and all that other stuff they tell you if you say anything) but I'm just very lonely. So I guess it's not exactly romantic love that I'm looking for it's more like the love of friendship. I don't have any friends. I have acquaintances or half-friends--a.k.a. people who are nice but don't want to really have anything to do with me outside of school or choir or soccer or whatever even when I ask them. So I guess I should just end this post. I have too many things to say and not enough space or peace/organization of mind.

       I'm back from New York and I've realized how I love Chicago.  Chicago is clean, beautiful, wonderful, smells nice, (did I mention clean?), and it's my home. But I am a bit partial. A New Yorker would probably say the same thing (except for the clean part) so I guess it's your own decision.        Which is better?   New York or Chicago?       Just kidding, that's not a good question because there are so many ways that it could be swayed by different subjects.      I was on TV today. On CBS (early morning show) and Tom Cruise was the special guest ; )   But anyway--the Global Youth Leaders Convention (GYLC) was there too and they got very mad at my choir very quickly. But they had good reason too. But I'll explain more tomorrow. I'll have to post pictures of everything later. actually, I'm going to post a couple right now. but more will be coming soon

       I'm leaving for New York tomorrow morning at 4:30 AM. but i'm not excited yet. but if any of you (very few) readers out there watch the early morning show on cbs (in Chicago it's channel 2 @8:00 &/or 8:30 AM, New York it's idk what channel @ 7:00 &amp;/or 7:30 AM) then you can see me Monday morning! Yep, that's right lol such a famous choir I'm in [*rolls eyes*]. If anyone does watch it then I am the one with the dark short hair and most likely a hair ribbon. but I think a total of three people (one being anonymous but sounding awfully familiar...!) that read this blog occaisionally that there will not be many people watching. oh well it's still a bit exciting.       Oh and after sleeping on those lines I wrote in my last post, I realized that with a select group of people I know (not family at all, sad but true) I have separation anxiety like a little kid. and that day that i posted one of the people closest to me left and I'm really really really missing them right now. and I will for a long time. because I know that I won't see them ever again in my life. And God only knows if I'll see them in heaven.

       I have a fever of 102° F and my parents still made me go to church today. At least I was able to take notes to keep myself awake. It was an interesting sermon but I still have a fever so it wasn't like I was completely able to give my whole, undivided,  alert  attention. I'm feeling rather frustrated but I'm too irritated to write out what it's all about. Have you ever noticed that the word frustrated is spelled rather strangely? Tonight I have to go with the rest of my family to a family from church's with house. (wow that last sentence was full of some very technical grammatical errors) It's going to be very interesting because my older sister fancies that she's "in love" with their son who is a couple months older than her. And the guy's mother thinks that they're a "perfect match" or at least that's what I heard her say to a neighbor the other day while I was sitting above them in a tree. Can I sing...Matchmaker matchmaker...don't actually know that song. What a mess. Phones ringing and the caller ID says it's my sister... Well, it looks like it will be me, my brother, and my parents going to dinner. My sister called from work--she just threw up (my theory is too much sun/lifeguarding in conjunction with dehydration) There's a terror warning in New York (right in the area that I'll be going to in a few days) and my father is really making me angry because he's immediately downsized it. I'm not afraid of it or anything or making a big deal about it/making it into a big deal, but he doesn't think that I'm telling the truth. But look at the headlines. I'm not fucking lying.  Alright, I better stop typing now. When I start swearing in typing (which I never actually swear) I know I've been pushed to the emotional limit in which I begin to be unable to express myself adequately through civilized words.
