      i have everything i want, but everything is not enough.   something is missing, completely missing, im listening to outsmarting simon and its opening my eyes so much more to my world. i'm so passive with feelings, everything passes me, i watch the world pass me by but don't do anything about it. i feel like all my life i haven't accomplished anything of significance for myself. i want to know what love is, to feel love, to be in love, to feel. I've grown so much, i can appreciate the beauty of life, but why isn't it enough... i'm going to tear myself apart looking for the one thing that may not possibly exist, and when i find it ill be nothing.

      im such a hypocrite. so contradicting. but how can i help it? how can i believe that life is anything more then the world we make it... i let myself go, i'm finding it  hard to care.  there is so much beauty in the world, but im finding a way to filter it out. my words go unnoticed, the beauty in the world amazes me, the simplicity of a flower touches me. but what good is that when there is no appreciation? i have everything i could want but still not enough... i search for love, because maybe love is the greatest thing... its the only left that gives me hope. i turn to music, but lately its been making me realize im holding back on my ambitions. i took a walk in the rain last night, i took a walk and looked at the trees... they stand so still. i wish i was simple, something without thoughts, something with wisdom. im only in highschool, but im starting to feel old. maybe its this feeling, the one thats been tugging at my soul... its telling me to search for it, search for the motivation i need. i need to escape from new jersey.. from this life  i don't want to become another statistic.

      if this is the only life in the entire universe. its pretty upsetting. i don't mean to say that life isn't grand, but i do mean to say that we as humans are monsters. i've been listening to outsmarting simon a lot lately and i really like it, its my thinking music, it helps me. good band. i feel bad for pj though, hes a substitue in LHS and all the little girls cream themselves over him and like rush to lick his earlobe. heh, im sure ive bothered him by saying hi, but i don't care, hes an awesomly talented person and being in his presence is godly.   i love life. and im starting to feel worn out "like butter spread over to much bread"
