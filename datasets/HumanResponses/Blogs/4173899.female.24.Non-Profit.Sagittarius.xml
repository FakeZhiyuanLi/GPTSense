      I'm overflowing with it today.  Last night I hurt someone I love dearly.  It was unintentional but I did it.  I've lied to people I care about and to myself.  There's not much to be said on the topic right now.  I'm so disappointed in myself and my disregard for another's feelings.  I'm nauseous with disgust for what has happened.  Sometimes I'm a very slow learner.  My other blog has been permanently deleted and this one may disappear very soon.    Things are not good here.  Things are not good at all.  And to the person..  again..  I'm so, so sorry.

      I hate to sound like the old guy sitting on his red stool next to you in the local diner but damn, "How 'bout this weather?"  It's cold and absolutely pouring here at my house.  In the fifties currently.  Hi.  I dunno if you realize this or not..but, um..  IT'S AUGUST!!  I'm not complainin' though, trust me.   This is a perfect evening.  I wish there were guests here.  I wish we were all nestled in the living room with candles and music and some food.  Sound good?  Come over.  Seriously, come on over.  I feel very welcoming tonight.  (this is an occasion)  heh.  Nights like these are nights to be shared with another in your bed.  Mmm..

      I was reading 'smitten' and she brought to mind a song I love.  that Buddy Holly song..  "Everyday, it's a gettin' closer goin' faster than a Roller Coaster..love like yours will surely come my way.."  Only, in my head..  I hear it sung by the girls in Gummo.  good film.  good song.  Mm..

      but only sometimes..  I can be a verbose, somewhat cheesy Twit.    I always carry a little notebook with me.  (i'm crazy, you see)  so, here's the junk I scribbled in  my little notebook that day, that random day a few weeks ago.  "Drinking coffee, having a cinnamon crunch bagel.  The top of the bagel is crusted with big, sparkly, raw sugar crystals.  I'm alone, very alone and surrounded by people.  It's Sunday and the Church crowd is coming in.  I wanted a paper but forgot to ask while he rang me up and I have no cash and so I'll wait.  I'll pick one up tonight after work.  After work.  After my new job.  After working at this new job that I hate.  I have 32 minutes until I plan to leave.  I'm sitting at a booth alone.  How selfish of me.  As the place gets more crowded  with the Jesus-loving folks in their Sunday best they will give me dirty looks as they pass me to sit at the small table across the way.  I want a cup of water but I fear losing my lovely window seat.  Ravenous mongrels.  Long lines with hungry faces, sandals worn with socks and loud talk of saving graces.  Bite #5 of my bagel.  Oh, the lovely spaciousness of my booth.  Ha ha - sit elsewhere - this one is mine - I was here first!  Na na na boo boo and all that nonsense.  It's mine.  I wonder if someone would ask me to move.  Khaki shorts, nice polo shirt, tidy hair and a fancy stroller with twins peeking out.  All well groomed.  la ti da.  I sit alone. I stare if I feel like it, I get overwhelmed with sadness - but nobody looking in today can tell - not even the perceptive ones.  It's a pretty day - a lazy Sunday, chance of rain.  I don't want to go to my newly acquired - HORRIBLE job.  My pen is running out.  Talk of babies behind me and motherly advice.    More staring.  Breathe and be prepared for tonight, today.  I told her I'd try to give it 6 months and I never want to return.  Get lost in a book.   Pull my hair up.  Have to keep it up at work to help prevent it from being pulled. Alone.  My heart feels ugly and Hard."

      I can relate to  urlLink this post  from E over at  urlLink jockey  so so much.     Here's a little snippit if you're too lazy to click..  I feel my physical need right now is throbbing and secreting fuck me vibes everywhere- and its covered by this crumbling thin crust of social pretense. its very irritating to me. I am very very frustrated. its not sexy or fun, its horribly stressful. But its not like I can just go fuck some random man and get what i need. It wont be any good- for me I need to be connected to the person, and I dont WANT any more faulty man connections. i dont know. I just know i am going nutzo and i have to do something. I cannot possibly masterbate any more than i already do. What a measly little band-aide it is for the deep wound in me. All the hurts that need to be fucked out.    *  really..  i couldn't have said it better  *

      I dreamt of my dad.  They were sort of ugly dreams and I woke up confused.    I'll be acquiring a routine soon and I'm thankful for it.  Yesterday I had my first interview since quitting my jobs and they hired me!  Yay!  So I'm now just a schmuck, not an unemployed one.  heh.  By the way..  you know I always want to do my part to help you learn something so did you know that the literal Yiddish translation of 'schmuck' means penis?  Perhaps I shouldn't go around calling myself that.  I am a girl afterall.  So, my new job is at a bank.  It will be  a different gig for me because my last 2 jobs, I worked at them both, simultaneously, for 2 years and they were both in social work.   (that sentence is a disaster)  Those jobs sucked a lot  of life from me.  I'm 24, I now look shriveled and 98.  Surely I jest.  Today I'll go get my drug test for the new job.  I was up studying all night.   har.   har.    I'm planning a "housewarming" party soon.  It won't be exactly that but a hip happenin' time here in my new place.  Ahh.  Good times.    Hope your day is nice.   Since I have to go get this drug test and it's fairly close to Target..I fear I'll be forced to go.  Muwahaha!!    Oh..  and..  crappy part of new job?  I have to dress up EVERY DAY!!  Oi.  As of now I don't own such clothes.  This should be very interesting.

      Energy Level is non-existent today.    I'm intrigued by you.  Plans changed last night and I was out, no cleaning to speak of.  I need/want to get in there and go at it but I think I could just fall off to sleep any moment.    Nothing good today for you.    Spinach is very good for you.  Jem, soothe me.  Pulse in my belly and lift me up.  Pick me up.  I'm here on the floor in an awful heap.

      You always claim that you don't like it, but then you are entranced and you stay..  You allow it.    Happy Friday the 13th.  I'm really excited about this evening..  I have lovely plans of cleaning my house and trying to imitate the amazing 'salad' I consumed at the Sushi House.  You know I'm getting either old or boring when these are genuinely exciting Friday night plans for me.    Last night my best friend was here.  We sat in the middle of the floor in my living room and ate grapes while disclosing secrets we'd never told anyone.  I've known her nearly 18 years and now and then there are things we keep to ourselves...  from the whole world and even each other.  I think this is allowed.  It's not because either of us is a bad friend..  Well, anyway..  It was great..really great.    Job update:  I don't have one, however..  yours truly does have an interview Monday morning.  I emailed a resume today and about an hour later they called to set up an interview!  Keep your fingers crossed for me.

      That's the message a fortune cookie delivered to me yesterday.  We all like fortunes like those, right?  Well, my friends..  a pleasant surprise was indeed in store for me!  When I came in the door tonight I stumbled over a small package.  Turns out, someone really great (and not just because he sent this) sent me, little ol' me, the Morvern Callar soundtrack!!  Oh wow.  a) the soundtrack is amazing.  i'm in love.   2)  surprises are sooo much fun!!  In the movie, Tully, there's this really great scene where he finds this cassette tape she's been searching for.  She loves it and thanks him much and he replies..  "I just wanted to try and surprise you."  He says it like it was a feat..  a little miracle.  What a kind thing to bless me with music, my one true love.    And now, kids. About my day!! Today was a good day. It seems like it's been awhile since I could say that without perhaps faking a half-hearted smile.  I spent the morning reading the Sunday paper.  (so it's Wednesday now, what're ya gonna do?)  I did some job search related tasks and was then invited to a friend's.  I passed immediately as I was deep in productive-mode and feared the slightest thing (say, a butterfly out the window) catching my attention and holding it for the rest of the day.  I went to my friend's home after a long shower and was indeed productive.  Afterwards, we rode bikes!!  Oh man..  it was so fun!  We rode on a trail by the lake and along a little brook and then all over the crazy streets with CARS!  whew.  scary.  I was convinced I'd be run over but I survived.  We rode to Sushi House and had some amazing Japanese food.  I had this wonderful 'salad' made of blanched spinach with this very hearty sesame dressing.  I loved it.  For the meal I had some soba noodles and we warmed our bellies further with hot sake.  After dinner we were full but not heavy laden and thus rode for awhile longer and then back home.  The day was absolutely beautiful and the night air crisp.  (It's August and I just said crisp..and not in that fried-skin way.  ew)  We were gone for about 5 hours on our bicycles so we put in a few miles.  As cliche` as it may sound..  I felt very alive at the end of the day.  I've been very sullen as of late and today was good.  The sunshine, the exercise, the air..all very lovely things.  After awhile at home we sat on the grass in the backyard..in the dark and had a bit of ice cream.  We pondered whether 'lightning bugs' or 'fireflies' is a more charming term.  I'm feeling a bit syrupy sweet at the Summer air this post contains.    Heh.  When I had first signed on here to write this I was bombarded by questions of whether or not I got a job yet.  This, sadly, burst my bubble a bit and I hope I was able to adequately get across the excitement the day held.  For awhile today, I was free.    And..  in case you were wondering about my fortune some more..  My lucky numbers are 6, 15, 22, 24, 36, 37.  I will definitely ride my bike tomorrow.  It's good for the soul.  I meant to also tell you, really good music with some harmonica in it is also good for the soul.

      He told me I taste good. I asked what I taste like.  He replied, "Like leisure.  You know, Summer and ease and promise.  Leisure.  Also, maybe apple butter."

      My computer is feeling rather inadequate today.  I informed him that he doesn't have enough memory to run our new DSL and since then I've had to keep reminding him that size doesn't matter.  poor guy.  On a happier note, I think the problem may be solved by someone being all too generous!!  Thank you.  By the way, for those of you inquiring..  I'll let you know when I have a job.  Until then, leave me alone about it!  Oi vey smere!

      Soo..yeah, the surprises were great.  I LOVE surprises..  but, damn..  sometimes, gimme a call if yer stoppin' by, ok?  I love surprise visitors but..  'alas.  shitty timing.  I had a surprise visitor today and it sort of just ruined/sucked away voraciously at my entire fucking evening.  I had all sorts of glorious alone plans..productive things on the list, but no.  My surprise visitor rode his fucking BICYCLE here from Leawood, left early this morning...got here this evening..  Ugh!  Anyway, he was all tuckered out so I got the honors of driving him home and then driving myself back.  Sure, an unemployed schmuck like me has loads of cash stashed everywhere just praying it gets spent on petroleum products.  (ok, vaseline could have seriously been way more exciting.  Mmm.)  So, anyway, the only redeeming thing about said visitor is the fact that he rented a movie FOR ME.  That's a cool concept, i might add..  He totally thought I'd dig it so he rented it.  We watched a 'short' that was at the beginning and I did all in my power to get him moved out the door.  He came in and made himself totally at home..  Usually, I love this.  Rifle through my fridge, sprawl out on the floor, find something on the horrible television...  just, tonight wasn't the night.  Oh well, I've certainly  made it much more dramatic than it really was.  His solution to the problem was to merely spend the night with me and ride his bicycle back home tomorrow.  (he does have a car, by the way)    I'm going to jump on hello and see if I might be able to put up a picture on this new baby blog.  I do love pictures.  Write something to me.

      Have been out and about all day, productive but not in the 'tracking-down-a-job" sort of way.  Friend dropped by and brought me this random care package that had exciting things in it..including good coffees.  Mm!  Came home from the out and about portion of the day and there was a squeezy horn on my door, which I've now fully come to realize it's from a friend's Moped.  The friend stuffed some rolled up things, scroll-style, inside the squeezy horn.  Included inside the horn were: 1 straw wrapper from Dairy Queen with my name and some cute stick figures drawn on it, 1 coupon for a free video rental at Hollywood Video (!!!) and 1 strawberry flavored condom.  ha!!  The last item crammed into the squeezy horn made me laugh very much.  I should've snapped a photo with the trusty phone.  It was charming and I feel loved.  Thank you, thoughtful people.     and..  I've been enjoying  urlLink this blog , belonging to  urlLink kj .  Since I've come out of the closet about where I live (Kansas City), I'm exploring a bunch of Kansas City Blogs.  I have lots and lots of blogs listed on my other regular blog (Unknown to you, dear reader) but am wary about starting to list them here as many of them will lead back to my other blog.  whew.  I'll start posting links soon.  Does that make sense?  Do you care?   I want a dog.

      white barrette in my hair, a rabbit..  always makes me think of "Chase the White Rabbit."  do it.  had a lovely outing a bit ago to fetch a Sunday Paper.  Being a free spirit [read:  Unemployed Schmuck] can be scary sometimes.  If you're hiring, call me.  heh.  In the meantime, I want pretty words and lovely pictures.    I got new sheets.

      Aww..  a new  baby blog has been born.  The gestation period was certainly hastened by my impatience.  I have one of these elsewhere and it's been around for nearly a year but I needed my own place to play and thus, this blog was created.  I don't like the template much and I'm horrible with making modifications but it will do for now.  Pull up a chair, stretch out on the floor, breathe deep and stick around awhile.  I promise to have some delicious morsels on here.
