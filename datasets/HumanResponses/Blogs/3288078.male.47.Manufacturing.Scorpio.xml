						   For the fiscal year 2005 President Bush has proposed that the US provide more than  urlLink 15 billion dollars  in foreign aid to the rest of the world. He also proposed another 15 billion dollars for  urlLink HIV/AIDS  relief back in 2003.   urlLink Charitable donations  by Americans totaled nearly  241 billion dollars  in 2002 (2.3% of the US Gross Domestic Product), making the US the most charitable country in the world, according to  urlLink Vexen Crabtree , a UK website.  Muslims worldwide hate us because we have given more than 91 billion dollars to Israel since 1949 according to the  urlLink Washington Report on Middleast Affairs  The WRMA continues and says "The impressive numbers for U.S. aid to Israel become even more so when they, and the attached conditions, are compared with other Middle East countries. The roughly $3.3 billion in annual aid compares with some $2 billion for Egypt, $225 million for Jordan, and $35 million for Lebanon. Aid for the Palestinian Authority (PA) is not earmarked, but has been running at about $100 million. Furthermore, aid to the PA is strictly controlled by the U.S. Agency for International Development, and goes for specific projects, mostly civil infrastructure projects such as water and sewers."    According to the  urlLink Christian Science Monitor   the US has given Israel $240 billion (adjusted to 2001 dollars in purchasing power) since 1973, compared to $117 billion for Egypt and $22 billion for Jordan.  Aside from the rhetoric of "who" we give aid to, it seems that the US policies related to foreign aid are linked more directly to politics than to humanitarian reasoning. Although Americans, by and large, believe we are a benevolent society, our politicians link the delivery of aid to manipulation of the behavior of other countries.   The average American citizen wouldn't think twice about giving assistance to another person who needed it. And, I dare say, they would give assitance with no strings attached, simply because it's the right thing to do. Yet, I pause to reason whether it is wise as a nation to utilize this same reasoning when it comes to providing billions of dollars to another country.  What if we had not opted to provide assistance to Israel? Would their nation have fallen? Israel was attacked by Egypt, Trans-Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq less than 24 hours after being proclaimed a nation by the UN mandate in 1948. That war lasted nearly a year and a half, before UN negotiations brought it to an end with all except Iraq, who to this day has refused to open talks with Israel.  In 1967 Egypt, allied with Jordan moved their toops into the Sinai desert, kicking out the UN troops, and shutting down Israels access to the Straits of Tira, sparking the 6 day war in which Israel struck a pre-emptive blow which ended  with Judea, Samaria, Gaza, the Sinai peninsula and the Golan Heights under Israel's control.  When Egypt and Syria launched a coordinated surprise assault against Israel     (October 6th,  1973), with the Egyptian army crossing the Suez Canal and Syrian troops penetrating the Golan Heights, Israel once again repulsed the attackers, crossing the Suez Canal into Egypt and advancing to within 20 miles of the Syrian capital, Damascus..   urlLink (UJ.Com)    In nearly every case, the negotiations to end aggressions were linked closely to the amount of aid the US would supply to each country.. Egypt and Jordan came out pretty well considering they were the attacking forces in 1967.   What other nation on Earth beside Israel has been attacked with such ferocity and frequency?  Had the US not contributed Aid to the Israeli's over all these years, I dare say it would not exist today. Yet, it is our very help that has caused much of the Middle East to hate us.   So much for the Middle East's hatred for the US (Not that it's simply a matter of financial aid.. There's got to be more to the story!) What of the rest of the world? Is it simply because our government is the most powerful in the world? Is it because those less fortunate are jealous? Or is it because our govermnent has consistently manipulated the governments of other nations through arm twisting, deceit and subterfuge?  Some of you out there reading this must have ideas.. Why not make a comment and enlighten me??

						   We dodged a bullet last weekend. A tornado struck a small town ( urlLink Hallam, NE ) which is merely 20 miles South of my house, and wiped it off the map. Unfortunately, there was one fatality - A 73 year old woman named Elaine Focken who had beaten colon cancer, and who was recovering from a broken hip. ( urlLink Local Paper ) Apparently, she wasn't able to make it to her basement fast enough.  The photos of the destruction tell the tale ( urlLink Photos ).  Every building in town was damaged, most were completely leveled.  The tornado was an F4, which had windspeeds up to 260 mph. It was also two and a half miles wide.. Think about that.. On average there are 12 city blocks to a mile.. that makes this tornado 30 blocks wide - ENORMOUS! (More about tornadoes in general and this tornado in particular  urlLink here )  More than 300 people have no home to return to, yet not a single one of them has asked for help. Not that they aren't getting it - they are, and plenty of it, too. People in the midwest are funny like that.. When disasters and tragedies occur, everyone pulls together to help those who need it, no questions asked. Come to think of it, that's the way most Americans are. So, why are we considered to be the bad guys by most of the world?  More to come in how Americans are helping in the world next time....

						   The past weekend's weather served a reminder that I live in Tornado Alley. There were no fewer than 8 tornadoes sited across the State I live in (Nebraska). Fortunately, there were no deaths or other injuries reported.  Tornadoes, though potentially deadly, are rather fascinating weather events. Those of you who live outside of the "Alley" really have no idea the power in a tornado. To give you an idea, I ran across this  urlLink video   on a  urlLink website  run by two storm chasers, Peter Crean and Scott McPartland. They shot the video as they ran down a tornado near Attica, Kansas on May 12, 2004.  At first, the video doesn't look like much... But 41 seconds into it, you begin to get the idea of the power of a tornado, as it rips the roof off of a building. Yet, what happens at the 52 second mark offers the real testament.. The house is completely lifted off the ground and goes flying off into the belly of the tornado where it disappears, no doubt into a million pieces.  The  urlLink National Weather Service  classified the tornado in the video an "F2".. As far as the  urlLink Fujita Scale  is considered, this is a  small  tornado. The most powerful is an "F5"... An F5 is credited as being  urlLink the most expensive  tornado in history, causing nearly a billion dollars in damage in May of 1999. The deadliest outbreak occurred in April of 1974, lasted 16 hours and produced a total of 148 tornadoes across 13 states, killing 330 people and injuring more than 5,000.  Tornadoes are deadly, but they are truly a curiosity for many people. Charles A. Doswell III, with the Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies, in Norman, OK has published what amounts to a  urlLink Doctoral Dissertation  regarding tornadoes.. A tough read for anyone who is not scientifically inclined, but quite informative for a weather buff such as myself. A Google search on the word " urlLink tornado "  produces nearly two million hits and reflects the amount of interest these phenomena create.   Tornadoes also produce quizzical  urlLink oddities .. Not that I personally believe each and every account, but as a child I once visited my Grandmothers farm in Northern Missouri after tornadoes had passed through the area. There was considerable damage to several farms near hers, but she was spared any major damage. The tornado had blown nearly every apple out of her apple tree and my brothers and I were given the task of salvaging as many as we could, and picking the few which remained on the tree. I found an apple still on the tree that had a six inch piece of hay straw pierced clear through it.  Some of you reading this probably wonder why in the world anyone would want to live here in tornado alley? Well, speaking for myself.. it's a good place to raise kids and corn. Tornadoes don't happen all that often, and with advances in radar over the years, we generally have plenty of warning. The West coast has earthquakes.. The East coast has hurricanes.. We've got tornadoes.

						   It seems like this has been a long week. Maybe it was the rain & clouds we had all week. Maybe it was stress and frustration due to changes here at work. Or maybe it was from all the media attention given to the prison abuse in Iraq or the slaying of Nick Berg being broadcast around the world.  I'm just happy the weekend is here. I plan on going fishing tomorrow morning. Doesn't really matter if I catch anything.. It's therapuetic. No radio, no TV. I can escape the mess the world is in for a bit.  Unfortunately, I won't stop  thinking  about it all - Whether my government misled me on the reason to go to war. Whether we're fighting over oil and not about a madman with WMD. Whether Nick Berg's life and those of hundreds and thousands of other people could have been saved. Whether we're going to do this all over again in Syria, or North Korea, or some other place. Actually, I suspect it's more a question of when rather than where.  Yes.. I'll go fishing tomorrow. Thank God I can Fish. TGIF everybody.

						   It started a little over two years ago. I'd somehow ended up on the mailing list of some Nigerian Scammers.. I'd received at least 50 emails promising me millions of dollars if I'd help the son/daughter/wife of a murdered African leader. All I needed to do was give them my bank account details... Yeah, Right.  For the most part, I'd forward a copy to the United States Secret Service, then delete them. But, one day I decided to research the matter a bit more. To my surprise and delight, there were people out there who were actually writing back to these conmen and reversing the scam! First I found a site run by an Australian gentleman named Lee Kennedy.. His site ( urlLink Sweet Chilli Sauce )had me laughing my ass off!! Lee was inspired when dealing with these crooks. He was taking them on a ride then publishing the correspondence on the web. I decided I would forward the latest request in my inbox to him. Lee responded promptly.  Yet, his response was not what I expected.. Instead of taking on the conman himself, Lee suggested I should undertake to reverse the scam myself. And I did.   What resulted was just over 4 months of correspondence between the scammer, who said he was "Jean Guei" son of the deposed (and now dead) ruler of the Ivory Coast,  urlLink Robert Guei . My main character was Dr. Forskin Smegma, Director of the Department of Ethnoscatology, Alimentary University, Jejunum, Alaska.   Jean desperately needed to move $25 million dollars out of a storage company and the Good Doctor was just the man who could do it. However, the Doctor's wife, Ginger Smegma ( urlLink Dr. & Ginger ) fell in love with Jean and decided to leave Dr. Smegma to go live with Jean. Unfortunately, the Dr. learned of her plans and sent a hitman, the most feared Innuit Warrior,  urlLink Nanook Noriega   after her. Jean was devastated when he found out Ginger was murdered at the DeGaulle International Airport. He was even more devastated after he'd traveled nearly 50 miles from Abijan to Agboville to get the money the Dr. said he wired.. not once... not twice, but THREE times and the $7500 wasn't there. In the end, I sent him this link  urlLink www.dictionary.com , told him to look up the word smegma, then ask himself "Do I want to be smegma the rest of my life, or a decent human being who doesn't try to steal other peoples money?" Jean placed voodoo curses on me.   Since then, I've scambaited literally hundreds more. Ahhhh... You always remember the first one, though.

						   It has been all over the news for the past two days... An American civilian in Iraq had his head hacked off by a group of Islamic extremists. They video taped the execution and put it on a website for all the world to see.  Nick Berg was his name, and by all accounts I've read he was a decent, kind and generous man. He'd gone to Iraq looking for work, and to help the Iraqi people. He was not a soldier, and he never hurt a single person, let alone an Iraqi citizen.  The men who killed him said it was being done in the name of Allah as revenge for abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American Troops.  The Muslim religion surely does not support this type of inhumane cruelty.  The men who killed him wore masks, and from the accounts I read, hacked at Nick Berg's throat for more than 30 seconds, Nick screaming in terror before he was silenced.  When I was a kid there were groups of other kids who used to pick on everybody.. They were thugs and bullies... We called them "Punks".  The men who killed Nick Berg are nothing more than punks. And, just as was the case with the punks in my neigborhood, the day will come when they will face justice. Justice will not be denied. Not only will they face man's justice, they will also face the supreme justice of Allah, for Allah surely would not sanction the brutal killing of an innocent civilian.   And, while I'm thinking of it, I'd like to ask a question: Does the rest of the moderate Muslim world realize that if they don't put a stop to punks like Nick Berg's killers and the suicide bombers all over the world, that the rest of the world will soon consider them to be punks as well?   Moderate Muslims MUST take a stand, and do it soon. If you have any consideration for your faith, you must decry the actions of the punks, and distance yourself from them. Should you not, you will face the same justice that the punks will, and it will be well deserved. True Mulims must be willing to stop the violence, because the alternative is the surest path to the extinction of your religion.  My view is aptly echoed in this piece by  urlLink Barbara Stock .

						   Blogging... Who woulda' thunk?!? Nearly 40 years ago, I was a 7 year old kid thinking I'd grow up and be an astronaut.. The word "Blog" didn't exist. Fast forward to the present: I'm officially a "Blogger".  Like most people, I've used computers for years.. Started out with a Commodore Vic-20. I know a bit more than the average user about how these things work, yet I'm still amazed by the internet.. How close it brings people, how fast it can be, how simply   cool   it really is. Just in the last year I've corresponded with people in nearly 20 different countries on at least 4 different continents! But, that's not what amazes me..   No, what truly amazes me is the fact that even though my correspondents and I have differing opinions on various subjects, not once has there been a difference big enough that one of us would consider shooting or bombing each other. It is a big world out there. There are many ways to look at things. There is room for consideration and tolerance. There is room for peace among all of us.   Today I created this blog. It's a start.

						   I was recently told by a friend of mine that I seem to be serious all the time.  Her observation caused me to take a serious (no pun intended) introspective look at how I view the world.   Some of my earliest recollections include the Cuban missle crisis, the assassination of a President, & the Vietnam war. As a child, our family lived in near poverty - there were times we literally rationed food, we had no car, & the shoes we wore had holes in them. The neighborhood we lived in was mainly populated with black people and Italians. Being white, our family was the minority. I learned about prejudice by being a victim of it. When Martin Luther King was murdered, riots broke out and I truly feared for my life.  In the Spring of 1974 I graduated from high-school and enlisted in the Air Force.. There was no hope for me to gain a higher education otherwise. The Vietnam war was still going on, and though I feared the possibility of being sent there, I had to take the chance. I wanted to boost the odds that I would not be killing other people, so I trained as a Medical Laboratory Technologist. Little did I know at the time that this choice would lead me to witness firsthand what the ravages of war leaves in its wake. Rather than describe all the battle wounds I saw, I'll leave it to your imagination.  After my military service, I became a cop.. it sucked. I quit after two years.  My first marriage ended when my wife rode off into the sunset with a long haired biker dude, leaving our two daughters and me behind.  My second marriage ended when I discovered my wife having an affair with the plumber.  My older brother Rick's marriage ended 4 years ago with his wife leaving him for another man.. In the divorce process her attorneys took everything.. the house, the car, the furniture.. He stopped it all with a 9mm to the temple.  Over the years we had the Iran Hostage crisis, the bombing of Libya, the invasion of Grenada, the invasion of Panama, the Persian Gulf war, the invasions of Haiti, & Somalia, operations in Kosovo, 911, war in Afghanistan and now the Iraq War.  Yeah.. Life is serious. Now let's all go have some fun. Tra-la-lala-la.

						   Oh... the JOYS of home ownership!!   My wife and I have lived in the same house for nearly 8 years.&nbsp; It's a 30 year old single story ranch, with a full basement. We've put a new roof on it. We've replaced the central air and furnace. We've put new windows in it. We've completely redone one of the three bathrooms, and made major plumbing repairs to a second bath. We've put on new siding, new soffits&nbsp;and new gutters. We've landscaped the backyard, the front yard, and the side yard.   The dishwasher apparently sprung a leak more than a month ago, (Unreported to this author by his wife or three children), which caused severe warping of the subfloor. In a spousal unilateral directive, it was decided that rather than simply repair the damage, it's time to remodel the entire kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;   It's a major job, beyond the capabilities of this writer, and because it  is  the   kitchen we are talking about,&nbsp;the job needs to be completed fast.&nbsp; Enter the  "Contractors "!   This is the construction season where I live.. Most Contractors are busy with new construction, and&nbsp;it took me nearly a week to find just&nbsp;4 contractors who are willing to offer&nbsp;bids for the job.&nbsp; The first one asked me "What&nbsp;does your budget for this job look like". I replied "I'd like to keep it under ten grand".&nbsp; The result was a not-so polite chuckle from the&nbsp;Contractor. "I haven't done a complete&nbsp;kitchen remodel under ten grand&nbsp;since the 80's" chortled the Contractor. &nbsp;The words "Second Mortgage" slipped insidiously into my conscience....   More to come.....
