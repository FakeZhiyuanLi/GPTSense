      Yet another joy in my life is the wonderful (sometimes expensive) pastime that is shoe shopping.  My best luck in shoe shopping happens when I am in the South.  For some reason, women have bigger feet out here or some explanation close to that, because I can always find my big, ole size 10's with no problem.  Now, when I headed for the "shoe district" in L.A. I was terribly disappointed.  They catered to size 6 feet...a far cry from my little (big) piggies.   I find it a huge triumph of will that I shopped in 4 different shoe stores today and only came back with one pair of totally cute sandels (that will be adorning my feet this evening and tomorrow).  Considering the shoe shopping today was "technically" for my friend and not myself, I think I came out relatively unscathed.  I did happen to go astray in the mall and wandered into a clothing store as well.  Let's just say that I will be adorned with 5 totally cute shirts this coming week as well!  But it's all good.  And the reason that it's all good, it's memorial day and that means every store had a SALE! SALE is a wonderful word.  It strikes fear into the hearts of men and sends women running (for it).  That was the word of the day...SALE!  Everywhere we looked.  SALE!  It beckoned to us.  SALE!  It made us wander far and wide in the land of retail.  SALE!  It has such a great ring to it.  I have to type it one more time.  SALE!

      My true friends rock!  I don't know what I would do without them and I'm sending out a huge thank you to whatever force of nature it was that brought them into my life!

      Geocaching.  It is such a wonderful "sport".  It can be done alone or with a group.  You can be really lazy and practically drive right up to some locations or you can hike for miles and take the scenic route.  It's the only time that I don't mind...falling down rocky mountainsides, tripping into rivers, getting eaten alive by bugs, walking into lots of spider webs, or stumbling into cactus, just to name a few unavoidable perks.  It's pretty much getting really gross, dirty, sweaty, bloody, funky, and then doing a happy dance when I find a little ammo box with little trinkets in it.  Or better yet, finding a "micro-cache" which is generally an altoids tin or a little black film container.  It's hard to convey how much I love this sport.  It gets me outside, in nature (who can sometimes be mean) having the time of my life.   Today is a good day.

      This past Christmas my mom received a really crappy gift.  They found a lump in one of her breasts.  The part that really sucks when a lump is found is all the waiting that is done afterward.  The doctors do another mammogram, to see whatever they didn't see the first time.  So that takes another week to schedule.  Then they decide they need to do a biopsy of the lump. (Yeah, stick a needle into her breast and see what comes out.)  That takes another couple weeks to schedule.  Then you have to wait another week for the results.  All thru this time everyone is being told to keep their hopes up.  It could all be nothing.  Her body is not trying to kill her.  Life will go on as usual.  Then you get the call...I'm sorry, it is malignant and we need you to have a masectomy and then start chemo asap.   I can't remember a previous time in my life when I was so mad.  I sit and watch friends do all manner of drugs.  I myself drink way to much and at the time was a heavy smoker.  Sex is a roll of the dice in so many ways it's ridiculous.  So why the hell, did this ambiguous, random, horrible thing happen to my mom?  Whenever I get a little too caught up in my "petty" problems, I take a step back and put everything into the correct perspective.  Sure, I'm not happy at this moment, things are rough but that's life.  My body ISN'T trying to kill me!  "I'm sorry your husband is being a jackass...your body ISN'T trying to kill you."  "I'm sorry you didn't hook up with that hot guy last night...your body ISN'T trying to kill you."  "I'm sorry I didn't get that job I wanted...my body ISN'T trying to kill me."   Mom is in the midst of chemo, which is a whole other story in itself.  My mother is an amazingly strong woman and she's doing the best she can with what's being thrown at her.  She has a wonderful sense of humor.  She has a great husband who stays by her side helping as much as he can.  She has a daughter who loves her for everything she is and tries to fly across the country as often as her vacation time and budget will allow.  She's had these things for as long as I can remember.  Now she has this one new thing...her body IS trying to kill her.

      I don't like how much power my dreams have over my waking life.  I can't remember the details from my dreams last night but they still put me in a bad mood all day.  The dreams contained people from the past, intermingled with people in my present.  I can't stand that "he" still has that much affect on me.  Heartbreak is supposed to fade after 5 years.  "He" is not supposed to be able to ruin my daytime hours anymore.  I always come back to that time, it never goes away.  I have this crazy belief that if a love was true, no matter how bad it turned, some part of it will stick with you.  Even if it's just a memory of the happiness felt during that time.  Why the hell can happy memories hurt so much?  It's not fair.   Now there's someone new and interesting.  Someone has come into my life to be a friend and break the monotony.  Only thing is there's already a problem.  There's already something that causes the simple act of being a friend to be difficult.  He smells like "him".  His hair is exactly the same as "his".  His body is shaped like "his".  In character and actions they are completely different but that can't stop the memories from creeping up on me.  There's no way in hell this is going to deter me from my new friend but damn if life doesn't make things hard on us!

      After taking 2 days to recover from my weekend, I have jumped headlong into studying for a test today.  I am lingering on the edge right now between a grade of A/B, so I can't bring myself to not care about studying.  I have this inbred urge to get an A in this class.  Of course, it doesn't help that it's a summer class and should therefore be easier than normal.  I take little comfort in the fact that we have someone in the class who made a 56% on the last test.   So my brain is currently full of all these psychological terms that aren't really any of the good ones.  I took Pathopsychology a few years ago...if I was taking that now, I'd have all kinds of crazy disorders to write about.  As is, I got nothin!  I plan on doing my ritual of at least an hour of pool after my test...hopefully I will do better than last time.   Work has become so freakin boring and not much has changed.  Well, a co-worker who turned into a pretty good friend left, but I only saw him a couple hours out of my day anyway.  I think this restlessness has something to do with the fact that I've kinda changed this job into a more permanant thing since it's paying for my classes right now.  Which means I'll be here for awhile...which means stuff won't change much for awhile...which means I will be going insane shortly.  Oh well, insanity is a party all on its own anyway.

      Saturday morning began with a headache and that empty feeling in the pit of your stomach after a long night of hard drinking.  Cracker Barrel helped a bit and then we were off again.  I was to play the part of "minority" that day...we went to Atlanta for a day of wandering around Piedmont Park during the annual Gay Pride festival.  It was a really good day, the close-minded, highly opinionated bastards (otherwise known as religious picketers) were only out for a few hours before they packed up their megaphones & signs and went to their "we're better than everybody else" rally.   Inside the park, there was a feeling of wonderful happiness and joy.  The happiness came from thousands of people who normally get harassed for simply holding hands in public being able to walk hand in hand, able to kiss, able to just be.  It was amazing & I was so happy to share it.   We walked our feet off, circling the park for hours, checking out all the vendors, live music and good food (not to mention really hot shirtless boys).  My favorite t-shirt that I saw (& would have bought if I hadn't spent the last of my money on a hammock) had black writing on a white shirt that said "Jesus, please save me from your followers".  I have a very negative view of organized religion...I am spiritual, just not very religious.  So this shirt was totally me.   The evening brought Steak & Shake and Boneshakers again.  I have done more dancing in the past 2 weeks than I have in the past 6 months!  Got to play with the pretty boy again (mmmmmmm) and watched with happiness as my boys found other boys to dance with and have fun.  All in all, it was a great weekend, despite the sore feet that are really pissed at me right now.

      My evening started off normally, had an early dinner at 5 Star Day downtown with my wonderful friend who was in town.  Then we headed home to take a nap before the evenings festivities.  I was already drunk when we got to Boneshakers, ah, the joy of home alcohol.  Did a lot of dancing, sang some karaoke (cyndi lauper, time after time)and did some kissing on a very pretty boy.  And when I say pretty I mean beautiful, black, long, wavy, soft hair...dark brown eyes...nice chest...good kisser.  That took up a good bit of my evening...but hey, it was time well spent.  There's not to many things better than having a handful of soft hair to grab when you're kissing on a boy!  Mmmmmmm, good times, good times.  Ok, I have totally forgotten the rest of the evening (little distracted right now)...think I'm just gonna sit here and think of black hair.

      The sun is still hidden behind clouds but that's ok, cause my favorite person is coming into town again today.  That's right people, I'm gonna be headed to Boneshaker's again...I'm exhausted just thinking about it!  Ah, the fun to be had.   And a little touch of the ironic today as well.  Got my test score back on the 2nd test we took.  I didn't really study for it, still got a higher grade on it than I did my 1st test!  Oh well, that's how college tests go.   One of my depressed friends is doing better...for now.  It's kinda annoying that his "significant other" doesn't like me when she doesn't even know me.  But I guess that's just the way it goes sometimes.   People are getting on my nerves today. Let's try some free association... dork...boy...toy...ask...say...me...them...today...as if...no...comment...tell...speak...hear...beggar...song... ok, enough of that.  Free association doesn't work so well when you have music playing in the background!  Don't think my heart is really into posting today. Champagne wishes & caviar dreams everyone.

      I got game, well, I sorta got game.  Random people have actually noticed that my pool game is improving.    Woohoo!  I wish classes were over, it's good that I only have 2 weeks left, but damn, I'm ready to go back to life without homework.  All the clouds and rain have contributed to the depression of a couple of my friends.  I currently have 2 of them who are spending way to much time in bed instead of going to work.  I feel bad for them but there's really nothing I can do about it either.  They're both having problems with their "significant others"...and you know how that goes.   I made the mistake of dating one of the people where I work.  It ended right before summer started, so he's been gone.  Well, he started back today and the first frickin thing he did was make a beeline for my office!  We ended for a reason, I didn't enjoy being around him anymore (he's a very boring person).  I really hope he doesn't intend on "visiting" every day...that's gonna get annoying really fast.  I'm probably just being paranoid, of course he was the guy who I caught a couple times driving past my house.  I live on a deadend road, there was no reason for him to be going down it.  When I asked him if he drove by, he admitted that he wanted to see if my car was there or if any other cars where there!  Now, I remember doing drive-by's on boyfriends in high-school...that was quite a few years ago!  Oh well, I'm sure this will be an ongoing thing.   I wish the sun would come out...it's starting to get to me too.

      Me and a couple friends went and saw the movie out in theaters right now called Saved.  That movie was so freaking hilarious!  The really scary part is that even though they're promoting it as satirical and such, all that is totally true!  I grew up going to a "non-denomination, full gospel church".  We had the dancing in the aisles and the talking in tongues, it was what I grew up in and therefore thought it was the norm.  This church also had a christian school that I attended from 1st thru 10th grade when it closed.  For 11th & 12th grade I was subjected to a Southern Baptist school (not really a step up).  But in both schools we had the uber christian girl, who was really too annoying for me to be around.  We had the rejects from public school, who were shunned by the majority, but who I generally hung out with.        We had the few people who disappeared half-way thru the school year, for multiple reasons.  We even had a girl who wasn't allowed to walk at graduation because she was caught in the motel room of a married man during the senior trip.   Don't get me wrong, my "full-gospel" church had it's pluses too.  We didn't have to dress up on Sundays (god loves us no matter what we wear), I was always entertained by the nutsy lady who at each and every service would fall out into the aisles "strickin by the holy spirit", and just think of all the aerobic exercise I got from dancing in the aisles.  Having never gone to public school until college at UGA, I can't compare as to which is better.  But I think I came out pretty well.  Either way, I got lots of fun stories to sit and be nostalgic over after that movie brought them all back!

      The past 24 hours have worn me out!  I was given a new title, made into a sandwich, chewed on, felt up, fought over by 4 boys, been "the drunk girl", and was given expert advice on the boy toy.  And all of the above happened at my favorite club here in Athens...Boneshakers.  Boneshakers is the best place to dance in Athens and I always get hit on when I go there.  (It's great!)  I guess the p.c. term for Boneshakers is "Lifestyle Friendly"...hence most of my evening was spent in the company of really pretty gay boys.  I have a theory though, as to why I always get hit on by straight boys and get felt up by straight & gay boys at Boneshakers.  I think part of what makes it such a great place to dance and such is because everyone in there is pretty much oozing sex.  So it stands to reason, that all the oozing kinda melts the 2 worlds of gay/straight together.  Everyone is there to just have fun, doesn't matter too much with who.  You see flesh in front of you and you just grab it.  (Makes sense to me.)   My new title given to me last night was "professional fag hag".  (Not to be undertaken without proper supervision.)  Part of my "professional duties" was to talk a cute boy out of his shirt (always good) and state that he now looked like a proper piece of meat.  (A very high compliment, if I do say so myself.)  The Kris sandwich was made out of me with 4 pretty boys on either side of me...ah yeah.  Unfortunately, a really good long island iced tea was sacrificed to the sandwich gods during that fun.  I'm gonna have a kick ass hickie tomorrow, cause today it STILL hurts, but I sure wasn't complaining last night!  (mmmmmmmm...turtle necks aren't suspicious in summer are they?)  I was officially "the drunk girl" (lots-o-alcohol = sweet fun) and was shuffled around the club and afterwards downtown by a few really sweet boys.  The expert advice on the boy toy was actually given today, but I think I still had most of the alcohol still in my system from last night, so it counts as the same night.  The advice was, and I quote, "He doesn't really twirl my tutu, but I see why you would like him...use him and lose him".   All in all, I think the past 24 hours were great.

      I have been and always will be Daddy's Little Girl.  And even though it can sometimes get annoying, (like when he gives my dates this evil "I will kill you" look, that he swears he doesn't know he's doing) he is a wonderful father and I'm so thankful that he's mine.  From when I was born till about a year ago, my dad was a CPA.  What that translates into is, I didn't see him from January to April cause taxes are evil.  But I have amazing memories all the way back to when I was really little of him taking time to play with me and in general being a great dad.  His family always comes first...no matter what.  He worked extra long hours, to bring in more money, so mom could stay home and raise me when I was little.  He was there for me when I freaked out 4 years ago and didn't know what I was going to do or how I was gonna get through everything.  With no hesitation, he paid quite a bit of money to move me and my cat across the country.  Knowing that what I needed was to be with the family that has always been my strongest foundation.   Obviously we have our differences, he's a parental unit, he's not gonna be happy with everything I do.  But no matter how annoyed we get with each other, we always come back around to the wonderful father-daughter relationship we are privileged to share.  Dad is the "sensible" one of our family unit.  I am practically a clone of my mother, so he's had to deal with 2 feisty red-heads most of his life.  He was given the role of "sensible" way back.  But he also has this amazing goofy side that is responsible for him letting a cat chase him around the house and sneaking up on his wife to tickle her.  That goofy side is also the reason behind him putting up with the inevitable wrestling matches he gets into with his daughter, who always manages to hurt herself (I hear red-heads don't know when to quit, maybe it's just me though).     Both my parents came from "broken homes" and I know they decided when they had a child they were going to give her the best life they could.  I have never in my life heard my parents argue with one another.  Let me repeat that.  I have NEVER ONCE heard my parents argue with one another.  I know they disagree sometimes, obviously, that's a fact of life.  I mentioned to mom a couple years ago that I thought it was so cool, that I had never heard them have an argument.  She sat there for a couple minutes thinking and then said, "I don't think you're father has ever raised his voice to me".  My dad has some of the worst road rage I have ever seen, but in the almost 29 years my parents have been married, my mom can't remember a time when he has ever raised his voice to her.  My dad is amazing!   To have parents like this, in this day and age, it's just wonderful.  It's hard to put it into words, much less type it.  I am so grateful that there are good people in the world like this and I'm even more grateful that they are my parents and my role-models.  I have already mentioned in previous posts that my mom rocks.  For Father's Day I wanted to send into the void the message that my dad is the perfect match for her.  My dad rocks so amazingly, hard-core, that I can't come up with the words to describe it any better.   Happy Father's Day, Dad.  I love you.

      I think I'll get the hang of this picture thing eventually.  My first tattoo (rose) I got as soon as I turned 18.  I had wanted a tattoo for years and as soon as it was legally possible for me to do so, there I went!  The legality had more to do with my parents than with the tattoo parlor!  I took a friend with me and she wussed out...but I was hooked. My second tattoo was added about a year and a half later when I went out to Arizona to visit my mom.  She had made a joke about 6 months earlier that the next time I came to visit her, she would get a tattoo.  She didn't think I'd be back 6 months later!  I gave her the general idea of the moon/stars and she drew that tattoo for me.  Mom also got a rose on her ankle at the same time.  (Have I mentioned that my mom rocks?)   My third tattoo was done with my "tattoo buddy" Dave.  Once again I had an idea of what I wanted...this time I went to the tattoo artist and he came up with a tattoo to incorporate all I wanted.  (The sign in the ocean is my astrological symbol Pisces.)  I am most proud of this tattoo so far.  It is so much me, it's ridiculous! My fourth tattoo was also done with my tattoo buddy, Dave.  It's the chinese symbol for Wolf.  I still plan on getting an actual picture of a wolf but didn't have the funds at that time, so settled for the symbol.   I plan on adding to my art the next time I'm in Arizona...I am now very loyal to Michael Bacon of Artistic Tattoo in Mesa.  If you're ever there, you can see my ocean tattoo in his book.  That's right baby, multiples of anonymous people see a picture of my tattoo every day!  (I'm so cool, ok not really, but I'll keep thinking it.)

      I got a phone call from my mom last night asking me if she sent me some vitamins would I take them.  I said a quick yes, because I was totally involved in the "drama" of bravo's celebrity poker showdown (Lauren Graham rocks!).  Later when I called her she told me she was worried that I was sounding a little depressed lately and she was going to send me some Vita B and other mood vitamins.  MY MOM KICKS ASS!!!  It's crazy that she's is in the midst of chemo treatment and all the crap that comes with that and she's worried about me being a little down!  When I told her the previous sentence she replied "I'm a mom, that's my job".  How did I get such an amazing mother?  She rocks so hard core because of this instance and the so many other times she's been there for me.  I repeat...MY MOM KICKS ASS!!!

      So yeah, I'm pretty sure I totally f*cked up my "first test in the first class that I've taken in 4 years".  I then went and played pool, stuffed myself with way to much chinese buffet and then went and played more pool.  And then in my depression decided to call an old "friend" and I'm not even going into the debaucheries that ensued after that.   Instead, I bring you pictures...well, as soon as I figure out this photoblogging thing.

      Today is the first test in the first class that I have taken in over 4 years!  So yeah, I'm a little wired.  I can't sit still, my brain won't stop running and damn if my eyes won't stop twitching!  It's overcast and gloomy outside, chances are I'll show up to class looking like a drowned cat.  But I'm ok with that...water helps with memory right?   I already have my post-test (hopefully celebration) plans set up.  Got some "pretty" boys coming to play pool and then gonna hook up with the boy toy later on.  All in all, hoping for a good day...I guess my blog tomorrow will tell!

      Pool rocks!  Saturday marked the first game that I have won playing pool.  Yes, that's correct, I actually won a game of cut-throat against 2 of my friends.  True, it was due to some major good luck but that didn't stop me from doing a happy dance when I won.  Another of the contributing factors to my not totally sucking was the fact that I was sober.  Who knew your hand-eye coordination is better when you're not inebriated!

      So is it bad that I'm looking forward to going downtown and studying instead of going to see that "riddick" movie with friends?  On the one hand, I'm outside, reading and enjoying the damn hot, humid weather, while getting something done.  On the other hand, I'm sitting inside on a saturday watching a movie about space aliens...tough decision.

      Don't you hate it when you can't stop thinking about someone that you really shouldn't be thinking about.  And you can't tell any of your friends, so you're typing into an anonymous blog with a sore pointer finger that has a nasty paper cut on it!  Yeah, I can relate.   When you just know that you couldn't stop thinking about him, even if you really wanted to stop thinking about him.  Even when you're with someone else, having a great time, there's that annoying nagging in the background.  "If you were with him you'd be having a much better time."  "If it was him sitting next to you, it would be the most comfortable place you can know right now."  But then of course the voice of reason is right behind that.  "If you were with him, everything and everyone would be different".  "If you were with him, your little world would be shaken to the core".  "If you were with him, you'd lose your footing entirely".   So instead you just sit...typing on a computer...thinking about him...wishing you had the guts to challenge the things that are keeping you away from him...but knowing that you won't.

      I love that I have some very positive people in my life right now.  Even some of my goobers that I get so upset with can cheer me up when we're all in a certain mindset.  You know that mindset, where there's just too much going on in life and you can't think about it...so you revert to something simple.  Examples include laughing ridiculously at phrases such as "30% chance of pilgrims" or T.G.I...RAH!  Riding around in a car with 2 friends who are screaming hardcore death metal at the top of their lungs has a way of not letting you think about the bad stuff.  Of course, when they change it up and hit some high notes, then you kinda want reality back!   Then there's that person who always has a calm smile on his face.  You can tell there's so much going on behind those eyes, but it never shows in the smile.  It's one of those contagious smiles that you have no choice but to return and it automatically puts you at ease.  I want more smiles like that in my life.   Today is a good day.

      The most important person in my life has been in pain and suffered over the past few days due to the treatment that's supposed to be saving her life.  I'm going crazy knowing that I can't do anything about it.  I can't even sit beside her, bring her gatorade, change the channels for her or make her laugh at dad playing with the cat that he supposedly hates...I'm on the other side of the country.  I have to hope that her favorite fluffy critter can be there for her, laying beside her, purring loud enough to tell her, "it's gonna be ok".  I still think it's horribly unfair that she has to go through all this crap and I still get mad about it.  Hence the inspiration behind the post entitled "Uber Bitch".  It's really hard to go on with normal life when I know my mom's normal life right now includes a lot of pain.  Oh yeah, and it's not a good idea to get really drunk when you're missing your mom something aweful.   She's starting to do better and I have to keep saying "at least it's not worse".  But that doesn't really help to much.  And she's such an amazing person that I haven't heard her complain once.  Through all of this, she is still considering the people around her and trying to make this easier on them.  My mom is f*cking amazing.  How did I get so lucky to be her kid?

      A good friend of mine is in love...actually the beginnings of love.  That wonderful time where you can talk on the phone for hours and still feel like you haven't talked at all.  When you are in the same room you have to be touching, even if it's just holding hands.  It's pure agony to be away from one another and forget about giving attention to anything else for more than 5 minutes!  As he and I talked for a couple hours yesterday, he tried to put into words all the feelings that are going thru him right now.  He asked me if I thought he was nuts because he's never seen me go butt crazy over anybody.  And it made me realize that for the past 4 years that he's known me, I haven't been "in love".   Wow...it's weird to realize it's been that long.  Don't get me wrong, I haven't been lonely or missing "stuff", but all the relationships I've had over the past 4 years have been very casual.  Even the last one, where the other person was talking love and all those ushy, gushy feelings didn't really phase me during and I was happy when it fizzled.  I can actually admit now that I kinda bottomed out on love and just about everything 4 years ago.  I was actually engaged to someone (it's weird to think about that too)...obviously, it didn't work out.  As I have been told by other, less tactful people, apparently my personality can overpower people.  So instead of him telling me he was feeling small, he decided to be mean, break me down and try to make me smaller.  Short story...I ran like hell from this town.  I spent a couple years recouping and have now come back to face my demons, as it were.  And I've been doing pretty good with that too...I start class on Thursday.  I'm so freakin scared about that right now, but that's yet another story for another day.   As I read over this entry it automatically comes to mind that part of facing my demons and showing that I have "bounced back" would be to fall in love again.  Watch my life turn into a lifetime movie where I can finally "allow myself to love again"(Gag).  But I really don't want that now.  I feel like I have too much left to do and adding another person to the mix makes it a little hard to move around.  But I also know that I can't really control when I fall in love.  One thing that has always been irrational about me is my feelings.  I've said it before and I'll say it many times again...I am Pisces to the core.  I go with the flow and generally the flow is controlled by my crazy emotions.  I can try and cut myself off from people, but that doesn't last long.  I'm a people-kinda-person, so I have to be out and about and if I meet the right person, I think I'll be brave enough to admit it.  But for now, I'm not trying to hunt them out. But I am happy that I can live vicariously through my far away friend right now.  Through him I can remember all those feelings.  I can remember how much fun it was...to make someone your whole happiness for just a little while and be perfectly fine with it.  To not worry about what's going to happen next week.  To ignore the people who are telling you to take it slow.  To hop on and enjoy the ride for as long as I can.  Cause, damn, it's gonna be fun!

      I'm not gonna sleep on it...I'm not gonna give myself time to calm down.  My friends f*cking annoy me.  Isn't that a bad thing, to say that your friends annoy the piss out of you?  Should I bother calling them my friends when I get so angry with them?  Should I lump them into the same catagory of people that I have loved...under the reasoning that if your emotions can run to the one extreme of really annoying that they also run to the other extreme of really caring?  There's got to be something wrong if I can really, really not like them so much right now.  And since these feelings are coming so often lately, shouldn't I just stop hanging out with them?  Doesn't that make me a huge hypocrite that I continue to hang out with them and then complain about it after I leave?  Are friendships really supposed to be this hard?  Can I really blame them for this?  What the f*ck is wrong with me?  Why am I having such a problem with them?  I knew who and what they were when I became friends with them...why is it now that I'm being such a bitch about it?   I guess this is why I started this blog...so I could have my own personal little bitch-fest.   Welcome to the damn party!

      While typing this I am currently listening to the wonderful Sinatra.  I love the kind of music that just transports you.  Whether it's to the moon, the past, or even a cheeseburger paradise.  Music is such an amazing thing and it's getting made all the time.  Yet, I sometimes feel like I was born in the wrong time and have missed out on the making of some really great sounds.  I would have loved to been around when swing music and big band music was making its mark.  Ah, all the swing dancing I could do!  I don't even think I would care about my bum knee that causes me to shy away from it now.   Of course, I live in a great town for music.  I don't take as much advantage of the music scene here as I should.  In all the years I've been here, I haven't ever been to Athfest...a fact that tends to get me dirty looks from my fellow Athenians.  I do enjoy heading downtown and seeing the random up & coming band putting in their time.  I was recently introduced to "hardcore surfer punk" which is an interesting blend of screaming vocals, drums, loud guitar and some kick *ss saxophone.  Mmmmmm...a pretty boy playing the sax...that's some good stuff.   But as "original" as some of this music sounds...it's kinda hard to see anything nowadays as breaking any new ground.  It seems to always be someones take on another kind of music, or a different way of playing what's already out there (that someone else has already done anyway).  Maybe I just haven't been exposed to enough music or maybe I just want to stubbornly hold onto the opinion that I was born just a little to late.

      I always have found it interesting how people act differently depending on the company they are in.  Granted, sometimes it is necessary.  I don't cuss when speaking with my boss or any of my uber-religious friends.  But I've always wondered how much someone's actions are dictated by the company they keep.  Do we all suffer from a type of mob mentality and wanting to fit in with a particular crowd?  Or is each specific behavior in each of us all the time and it just manifests itself depending on the environment?   Why can't I make some friends go away and others come closer?  Will I ever get a tan that actually looks tan?  How am I gonna get those strappy sandals to stay on my feet?  Are college classes gonna kick my *ss once again?  What the hell is deja-vu...really?  Is the chase more fun than the capture?  Am I gonna capture him?  Do I really want to?  Is it time to go home yet?   I really hope I make it to the beach sometime soon.  Some sand under my feet would be really nice right about now.  I need to figure out something to do after summer class as a "congratulations" to me.  I have a month to ponder.  Hmmmm.  Summer.  Beach.  Sand.  Fun.  What class???  The plan for this coming month is to concentrate on class and try not to get distracted by shiny objects.  But oh, the shiny objects that are out there right now!   Is poker going to be hard to learn?  Will I ever play pool well?  To curl or not to curl?  Short or long?  I think the elliptical machine at the gym has a personal vendetta against me.  Oh look, it's bout time to go home!

      Today I planned to vent alot of anger, resentment and annoyance at the morals (or more accurately, lack of morals) I have recently witnessed in a couple of my close friends.  But before I started the ranting, I wanted to check out another friends blog that he just started.  He was inspired to start it after reading mine and seeing how much posting to it helps keep me sane (sorta).  Instead of his first entry being a venting session, he made it an expression of happiness about his "great" friend who is thousands of miles away from him.   So instead of angry, resentful ranting, today is going to be about the good things in my life and the things I hope for.   I have 2 amazing parents that are always there for me.  I have a laid back job with kickass benefits.  My co-workers rock.  I have 2 ever-entertaining cats.  I love my car, Zoe, she's perfect for long car trips.  I've been to England and Ireland and I plan on going back.  I plan on living in California for at least a year.  I will live right on the beach sometime.  Mom and I will finally take our trip to Hawaii, one of these days.  I will go camping.  I will go fishing and actually catch a fish.  I will learn how to play pool.   I will learn to accept people the way they are and not judge them for it.

      Up until a couple days ago I had not smoked a cigerette in 6 months.  Six whole months!  It's pretty safe to say that the nicotine had made it out of my system since December.  I'm not really sure why the urge came, or why it was so much stronger than any of the others that I've had over the past 6 months.  I wasn't even planning on going out to a bar that night (even though I ended up at one). I just wanted a cigerette badly enough that I headed straight downtown and into my favorite cigar shop.  My favorite thing about cigar shops is that while my friend is checking out all the oddly named hot sauces on the shelf, I can simply buy my cloves and light one up right there.  And oh man, was it good.  Yet another thing I love about cloves, they aren't harsh like regular cigerettes that I tend to dislike immensely.  I guess I'm "high maintainance" when it comes to stuff like that.  I prefer liquor to beer and cloves to regular tobacco!  "Prefer" = won't drink/smoke unless I'm already too drunk to notice!  Yes, it's that bad.   I guess I'm doing good, because after a couple days I still haven't gone thru half the pack yet.  But it is a beautiful day out...think I need to go outside for awhile.

      I am a Pisces to the core.  I have created my own little reality, that everyone else has to fit into.  I get antsy if I've been in one place for too long and I love the sea.  I just might possibly have an old soul.  I tend to pick the wrong guys and I've ALWAYS been a sucker for a good Taurus.  I made it a hobby to learn about the other signs, so that when I meet someone new, I can try and place their sign.  I'm getting pretty good at it too!  Obviously, it's not an exact science but the similarities that can be pulled between people and their signs are amazing.  I use it as a way to kind of cheat when I make new friends.  I find out their signs and I am better prepared for the little quirks in their personalities that make them, them. I figure it's hard enough figuring out ourselves and others that a little help (no matter where it comes from) is a good thing.  If it turns our right, rock on...if it turns out wrong, no loss.  Life is life, might as well make the journey as enjoyable as possible.

      This time it's a plan that I can most likely stick to!  This is "the plan".  I'm the only one who can make it deviate...and deviation is not in "the plan".  So what is "the plan", you ask?  Well, I'm glad you're wondering.  "The plan" has multiple parts, lets work with it chronologically, shall we.  "The plan" is to finish my 10 classes that I need to graduate within the next 2 years.  Normally, it would only take one year, but I figure I'll keep working till next summer, taking only 1-2 classes per semester.  Then once next fall hits, I'll quit the current day job, get a part time night job and live on loans.  Going full time I should finish within a semester or two.  After that part of "the plan" is completed then the real fun starts.  Since I will finally have gotten my degree I can be free to travel and not feel guilty.  And travel I will!  The first stop that is likely in "the plan" is California.  Spend about a year in San Diego, or possibly San Francisco (I haven't been there yet so not sure).  Anywhere in Cali will be fine, except for LA, I spent a week in that town and that was enough for me.  Then the next stop in "the plan" is Portland, Oregon...simply for the reason that I hear it's pretty there.  I've been told I'd like Colorado too, it's not really in "the plan" but it could pop up.  And of course, "the plan" includes a place by the beach at some point.  Oh yeah, and the last stop will be back over in England...I spent a few months there once and I loved it!  So "the plan" has to include Europe and all it's fun.  "The plan" also includes getting admin jobs in the different places so I can get by with bills and all that crap.  I figure while I'm hopping around all these places it's possible I'll get an idea of what kind of career I would like and be good at.  So "the plan" has me settling down around early to mid 30's in some kind of career and location that suits me.  Here is where "the plan" gets really fuzzy.  A family is possible, but not necessary.  Don't really see "a man" traveling around with me to all these places but if I find the right guy and he wants to do it, hey, bonus!    I'm so damn proud of "the plan".  I'm hoping it will work better than any of my previous plans that generally centered around other people.  I figure hey, might as well plan for myself and be happy, you never know what will happen!

      So is there a gene that's responsible for someone's personality or lack thereof?  A person can look absolutely normal and at first meeting they seem coherent and interesting.  These are the ones that really get me...you don't realize until you've started talking to them more that they have no personality.  It's not that they are hermits or anything, they have friends, they go out like normal people but when it comes to jokes, witty banter or anything more than basic sentences they are completely lacking!  These people should be made to wear signs or maybe they could be tagged like wild animals...if you see a flashing light on their ears be aware you're in for a boring conversation.    Nowadays, people can take pills for everything...depression, a.d.d., adult a.d.d., a.d.h.d., chronic indigestion, when are they gonna make a pill for personality deprivation?  They would sell like mad!  You could slip them into your boring dates drinks when they're not looking and poof, no more boring date!  I think I've got a great idea here.

      I have discovered 2 more categories to lump people into ("stereotyping is fun" she says semi-sarcastically).  Those who have lived independently & those who have not.  The independent category consist of people who have moved out of their parents houses and proceeded to live alone, no significant others, no roommates, if anything, they have pets or plants.  I've noticed that those who have lived independently are capable of spending extended periods of time alone and even enjoy it.  Example: this weekend I went out w/ a friend for a few hours saturday night and I talked to 2 friends on the phone for a few minutes each...that was it.  I spent a quiet weekend watching movies, reading, cleaning my apt. etc. and it was great.  I needed a break from my past few weekends of traveling and people.  The people in the other catagory, those who have not lived independently, tend to pretty much always want human contact.  They chat on the computer, they talk on the phone, they hang w/ friends/roomates etc.  They have this need to not be alone, mainly because they've never had to get used to it, they haven't learned to survive independently.    I've also noticed there is a difference in the way these two types of groups fight.  Those who have been independent will have the argument/what-not and then when they leave/storm out they stay gone.  They are perfectly happy being alone and not having immediate contact w/ the offender.  Those who have always lived w/ other people handle arguments differently.  They tend to come right back after the argument.  Whether it's physically showing up again or calling the person on the phone, in some way, they have to keep in contact with that person (and generally keep the argument going).  It's as if in some way, as long as they have the attention of someone, they are ok.    I don't really think either way is better/worse than the other.  They are just different and I am now having fun trying to decide by people's personalities whether they've lived independently or not.  Yet another way to amuse myself by just watching people and not having to actually speak to them!

      I remember a guy I used to date (in my early 20's) would try to start fights with me over the fact that I never had really angry arguments (screaming preferable) with him.  Yeah, talk about stupid.  One word that I learned the definition for early on in life was "apathy".  A favorite phrase of my mother's was "you're so apathetic", said with that annoyed mother look on her face.  It was true, I just didn't care about most things enough to get that worked up about them.   And I've pretty much kept that theme thru most of my life.  Don't get me wrong, I have that nasty temper redheads are famous for, I just learned early on how to express it in other ways.  I still let my emotions take me for crazy rides but when they take me to that angry place I get together with that old friend apathy and it's all good.    I have a friend who believes that relationships aren't any good unless you have regular screaming matches w/ the significant other.  Now I like proving my point just as much as the next guy but I sure as hell don't have to scream to get that point across.  My friends' point comes from the idea that if someone can reve up your emotions so much that you scream (about once a week) then the opposite emotion of love etc. should be just as strong.  Problem is, that's not always the case.  I've had some really awesome loves that I felt amazingly strong about and I haven't screamed at someone since 6th grade.    I guess it comes down to personal choice...I personally have chosen to vent my anger in ways where I don't lose my voice for a couple days later.  Hey, to each his own.

      I've had an epiphany! No, really...it's a good one. Ready for it? Ok, here it comes. Hetero boys make me nervous. It doesn't matter if I am attracted to them, repulsed by them or apathetic towards them. Just something about them being hetero innately makes me uncomfortable around them. And what do we do when we're uncomfortable class??? That's right, we try to protect ourselves from what's making us uncomfortable. My preferred way to protect myself in social situations is to make jokes. Throw in a few snide comments and pot shots and you've got a good picture of "Kris, the protected". In normal (comfortable) conversations, I generally make (what I think are) witty comments but when I get uncomfortable they tend towards the underhanded. You know those comments that are said w/ a smile on your face but tend to have a nasty, sharp edge to them.   So picture if you will, Kris, in full protection mode, playing pool w/ 1 pretty boy, 1 semi-pretty boy, and 1 gay boy. Yeah, I think I pocketed maybe 5 balls in 4 games! Thats right people, out of 60 fucking possible balls, I pocket 5...what the hell??? So as the games go on I get more frustrated at myself and my comments get more frequent and more biting. And of course, instead of spreading them around to the different boys they stay aimed at semi-pretty boy (who I have some issues with, but none of them have to do w/ the pool table).   Then after the boys leave and I calm down I start feeling guilty. So now I'm making myself apologize to hetero boy. I don't even know if he noticed anything but now that I know what I was doing I need to make it right for my karma sake. Plus, the poor guy's been really sweet playing alot of pool w/ me while I am learning. He doesn't deserve my smart ass comments. Outside of the pool hall I can tear him apart, but not when he's helping me out w/ my game. I guess I'll figure out what to do with my epiphany some other time. Maybe one day I'll meet a hetero boy that doesn't make me nervous.  I'll probably be in for a whole world of trouble when that day comes.

      Hangovers are so damn annoying.  Actually, it's the contributing factor of very little sleep that always tends to come w/ lots of alcohol that's so annoying.  Last night I visited a wonderful mexican restaurant here in town, the reason, Margaritas.  Last fall, it was tradition...every Sunday myself and a friend would be on the deck, chilling under the umbrellas, working on our 2nd pitcher of margaritas.  That tradition has died, but we get nostalgic every now and then.  Last night was one of those times.  Of course, after we finish up the margaritas, she leaves to go see her boyfriend and I'm left w/ nothing to do for 2 hours (till the boy goes to work & she plans on hanging out w/ me again).  So after exhausting all the contacts in my phone (no body loves me, everybody hates me, guess I'll go eat some worms...bastards), I head home with the full intent of just drinking till she calls.    Then comes a call from my future roommate...we're just hanging, we can come over and keep you company!  Woo Hoo!  Now the "we" consisted of my future roomie and an old ex of mine.  Whatever fucked up stuff we went thru during/directly after the relationship was years ago and we've been very polite when we run into each other, so I figure it'll be fine.  My future roomie ditched us pretty quickly and the ex & I hung out till his current girlfriend got off work and joined us.  I ended up hanging out w/ the both of them till 3 in the morning, just drinking and having a ball.  They are so totally cute together, they match one another perfectly and they're one of the disgustingly cute couples that I tend to make faces at when I walk past.  I'm really happy for him.  And the best part...she actually liked me!  None of this, him disappearing cause she doesn't like me shit.  So now I have 2 more people to party with...yippee.  And can I say one more time, they were so totally cute!

      My weekend ended up being pretty good.  Well, until I had to come back.  But lets start at the beginning.  The weather was perfect for a road trip.  I had the windows down most of the way, traffic was light and I was only on the road for about 7 hours.  Checked into my hotel and spent some time pool side, took a nap, enjoyed being away from everything/everyone.  Saturday was spent with grandma...organizing cassette tapes, packing away grandpa's clothes, simply enjoying one another's company and remembering how cool grandpa was.  Grandma wanted me to take her to church on Sunday, so at 10 am I found myself sitting in a Lutheran church trying to make a killer headache go away.  It was communion Sunday, so I went up front with grams and ate the cracker and drank the wine.  I didn't choke on the cracker or anything!  (visions of instant karma with me being "absolved" of my sins)  Left Orlando at 1 in the afternoon.  Now comes the not-so-fun part.  I was on the road for 10 hours!  There was a huge pile-up on I-75 north and they shut down the highway for 5 hours! ( http://www.macon.com/mld/macon/9187272.htm ) It took me 3 1/2 hours to go a mile and half!  On the upside, I did read a couple chapters in my book (so long, &amp; thanks for all the fish) and it rained and cooled things off so I wasn't in horrible heat.  Plus, I wasn't one of the people in the accident, so hey, all in all, it was a good trip.  I don't think I'll be taking any more long road trips for awhile.  I'll stick to the 4 hour trips that bring me to beaches, mountains &amp; cute boys!

      So tomorrow I'm headed to Florida again to see Grandma.  She'll be moving to Michigan at the end of the month and due to work circumstances this weekend is the only time I can get away to see her.  So tomorrow I'll be on the road for 8 hours, blech...good thing I've got about 4 gigs of music on my ipod.   When I talked to her today, she told me that the satin pillow that my mom sent in my name to grandpa was buried with him.  So he will forever have a white pillow that says "I love you grandpa" and a card that says "thanks for all the crabcakes" with him.  I think that's pretty cool.

      It's official, I got an A in my class.  I rawk!!!   \m/ Work had me busy today surplusing all kinds of crap...aka, manual labor.  Now I enjoy being able to get away from my desk, but searching for a serial # on a naked mannequin w/ only one leg is not my idea of fun.  It's amazing the things that fall into "other duties" on resumes.  I remember when I first started working here a professor asked me to get a couple props for her class that day from a storage room.  Cut to me 10 minutes later, elbow deep in male genitalia, looking for cancerous gonads!  Oh yeah, my job is "teh fun".  At least it makes for good stories!

      This is so sad...I have no idea what to do with myself!  I got used to juggling my time between friends, classes and work.  Now, most of the friends have significant others that they spend time with, the classes are over till late August and work is dead!  My apartment is clean, my laundry has been done, what the hell am I gonna do with myself???  Before I started classes I had wasting time down to an art form...now I've lost my touch.   There's all sorts of stuff I "could" do, but none of it sounds fun right now.  Even geocaching isn't peaking my interest...that's just bad.  I think the road trip made me a little restless, I'm ready to head out of town again and not come back.  Actually, the restlessness started before the road trip, I just aggravated it.  Where's my champion and his white steed...hell, I'd settle for a rich guy with an airplane right now!

      So my big plans of playing pool and getting drunk after my test on Thursday didn't happen.  Instead, myself and a friend headed to Savannah for the weekend!  I had called him after my test to find out when he was going to come play pool, he decided to call his work for some reason and told me he would call me back.  Five minutes later, he says he has the next 3 days off and should do something to commemorate all that time off.  The answer...ROAD TRIP!!!   We got into Savannah, GA. Thursday night around midnight.  You gotta love a town where people are still out in force at midnight on a Thursday.  We wandered around town for awhile, then crashed at a really nice hotel called the Mulberry (my friend realy liked the peach colored toilet paper).  It was right on bay street (across from the water) and right in the middle of everything.  In exploring the hotel, we found the pool and hot tub...of course, late night swimming was the perfect way to relax after that long 4 hour drive.  :)   The next day saw us roaming around Savannah doing the tourist thing...the park squares there are so cool (check out the movie Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil to see what I mean).  The old Southern architecture rocks, most of the buildings are falling apart, but they're doing it in the kickass "ole southern" way.  I made time for sunning at the pool while he wandered around Savannah (I managed to walk a blister into my foot the first morning, so lounging by the pool was therapeutic anyway!).  We headed out to Tybee Island that evening for dinner and more wandering around.  We ate at this place called The Crab Shack ("where the elite eat in their bare feet" I swear it's the f*cking motto of the place).  It was the best seafood I've had in awhile.  The meat came out of the crab legs so easy...the oysters were just the right amount of mushy and juicy...the shrimp slipped out of my fingers every damn time.  One thing I can say about seafood like that...it's definitely not date food.  Good thing I wasn't trying to impress my friend...cause damn if I'll be proper when you put crab legs in front of me.   The next morning found us heading to Hilton Head Island, SC.  I love going there but it always creeps me out too.  They have restrictions on the buildings and such, so they all look the same, very stucco and plain and expensive.  Golf courses, BMW's and Lexus' as far as the eye can see.  We rented a couple bicycles and trolled around the island all day.  We wandered on the beach a little during the day, but I opted for the pool when it came to sunning.  (I hate trying to get sand out of all the crevices it tends to creep!)  Went to the Frosty Frog for lunch, it had an awesome chicken philly sandwich.  Then more cycling and sun time.  Then to the Salty Dog for dinner.  More amazing seafood...more messiness...big time happy.  Then night beach walking with heat lightning in the distance.   Today saw us headed for home.  But not before stopping at "the crazy crab" for lunch.  And guess what...more f*cking amazing seafood.  If I could afford it, I would live on fresh seafood.  A few hours later we were back in Athens and I was feeding my cats canned cat food to make up for leaving them for 3 days.  So yeah, I had a good weekend...makes me want my (future) place by the beach even more.  I could get used to a Bohemian lifestyle, I'm good with being sticky for days at a time and living in a bathing suit.  It works.

      Today is the last test in the first class that I have taken in over 4 years. (deja vu for one)  I currently have a mid level A in the class, so it's really hard to get myself to sit down and study.  I was in the middle of studying a chapter and decided I should post to my blog!  Of course, one of the chapters we're covering is on procrastination, so I'm just putting my new knowledge to the test.  And I guess because the end is so near, I'm really hyper right now too.  The hope is that I can center my chi before I take the test.  Most of these tests have been more common sense than memorizing stuff...so as long as I calm down and am able to read the test questions clearly, I'll be fine.  It's the calming down part that's the issue right now.  I have 4 hours to either wear myself out or calm the hell down.   I have big plans after my test of playing pool and then getting ridiculously drunk and probably playing more pool after that.   Ok, I can't sit still any longer, guess I'll find someone to harass, that's always fun.

      Isn't it annoying when a plan that you thought had worked perfectly comes back and bites you in the ass months after implementation.  I worked damn hard to make a guy I was dating think he broke off the friendship/relationship.  I know everyone knows what I'm talking about.  The person you're spending time with is such a sorry character, that you don't mind them thinking they dropped you as long as they go away.  Plus, it cuts down on the needless drama of them trying to "make it work" and in the end you don't get viewed as the bad guy who broke everything off.  This tactic comes in handy when you know you will be seeing the person again...like when you work with them.  (Oh yes, I date people I work with.  I think I've dated someone from every job I've had.  I have a patent on the "I haven't seen you naked, so don't talk to me...stare straight ahead in the hall when passing" look.) I tried to avoid resorting to the kind of underhandedness needed to pull off what was described above.  But in the end, it was inevitable.  The plan worked great, in the beginning.  I was just enough of a bitch to be annoying, but not enough to make it seem like I wanted out.  I saw my chance to run, when he used an e-mail to respond to a voicemail I had left him.  It was great!  I had the whole summer free, I didn't have to waste time making excuses of why he couldn't come over or why I didn't want to go on a walk in nature with him.  (I love being outdoors, that was how much this guy annoyed me...even being in the great outdoors was a snore with him!)   So he shows back up after the summer is over and kinda hangs around my office.  I was worried at first but then he kinda tapered it off, so I figured he got the clue.  Yeah, not so much.  I get an e-mail yesterday telling me how he was sorry "things ended so abruptly".  (It took me 3 weeks to get rid of this guy, that sure as hell ain't abrupt!)  He "misses the way things used to be" and he is sorry...blah, blah, blah.  I'm hoping if I just ignore him, he will go away.  Sometimes that actually works, of course, we all see how wonderful my last plan worked! Damnit, what's that saying about "the best laid plans"?

      The events the following complaints stem from actually happened a couple weeks ago, but I was busy posting other stuff and didn't have time to vent.  Well, it's about that time! Don't you hate it when you get stood up.  Even when it's just an informal, my people are gonna be here, you should bring your people, kinda thing.  Yeah, I do too.  I really hate it when it happens with the same person 3 times in one week!  You issue the nice invitation of come & play, it'll be fun...the other person says, "I'll be there".  Then you get a call after you've been playing for awhile, and are way to drunk to get pissed that they are just calling to say, "something better came along, but I'll meet up with you tomorrow".  Then when tomorrow hits, you get up early, which is never advisable after a night of hard drinking/playing just to get another call saying, "something better came along earlier, but I can suffer thru your company if you really want me to".  To which you respond "no thanks, we'll be fine on our own".  (Grumble, grumble, we could have slept a few more hours.)  Then 5 days later, it happens again.  "Sure, I'll meet you guys, sounds like fun."  The next day, "oh sorry, I fell asleep and ended up not going anywhere".  This coming from an insomniac!   A good thing from this debacle was the joy that your friends got from you erasing the offending person's phone numbers from your phone.  Complete strangers actually got a kick out of it!  Of course, pretty much anything is funny at 2am after a few long islands.  Also, if the offending person had actually shown up, you probably wouldn't have noticed the pretty haired boy that you got to play with.  So all in all, it was a good thing, but don't you just hate it when you get stood up.

      On Wednesday June 30, 2004 my grandfather passed away.  I didn't hear about it until that evening and it didn't really hit me until the next day, when I realized that I would never hear his voice again.  My grandparents live in Florida and prior to a couple months ago, I hadn't seen them for a few years.  They are the only grandparents that I knew, my other sets having passed away when I was very young.  So it was up to my dad's parents to spoil me rotten.  And spoil me rotten they did! When I was younger they lived in Port Charlotte, Fl. right on the water.  I remember grandpa taking me around in one of his 2 boats they had at the time (squirt & jellybean).  I have a very vivid memory of going under a bridge in Jellybean & wondering at the concrete crossties above me.  (I probably wasn't any older than 5 at the time.)  Every day Grandpa & I would go out to their little pier and check the crab traps. (We've got some great pictures of me trying to "help".)  Grandpa made the best crap cakes I've ever tasted & he has spoiled me forever with them.  In 1st grade we had to gather recipes for some kind of fund-raiser, my recipe was the 1st grade version of how to make crab cakes.  I believe it included the technical instructions of "you need to put in a handful of stuff with the crab" to make them taste good.   Most of the time spent with my grandparents was in Zellwood, Fl. at one of those retirement communities where you can't stay for more than 2 weeks if you're not over 50.  Grandpa was always good at letting me sit on his lap and drive the golf cart...I got to drive it by myself once my legs got long enough!  While grandma was in cooking or playing cards with her friends, Grandpa & I would head down to the clubhouse to play Shuffleboard.  He always made sure I won at least one game & managed to do it so that I didn't know he was letting me win.  I actually wondered why I got so bad at shuffleboard when I hit my teen years!  Grandpa, like very other good Floridian, had orange trees that I would help him water and fertilize.  He also had this really cool aloe plant that I inevitably used on my sunburn every trip there!   When I got towards the end of my teen years and my grandparents actually became people as opposed to relatives that you take for granted, I met a different side of grandpa.  He had flown bombers in World War II and still had nightmares from it.  He was stubborn as all get out, but alot of that had to do with living with grandma!  My dad's biological father died when he was 40, the grandpa I knew had actually been married to my grandma's sister.  When his 1st wife died (grandma's sister) and grandma's husband died (my dad's bio. father) he and grandma got married...that was just what you did back then.  They were together for 30-something years.  Even in their mid 80's, they still loved each other so much.  They were always holding hands and kissing each other, it was totally cute.  Specially since grandma's really short and grandpa's really tall!   Over the past couple years their health had gone down and they just couldn't take care of themselves any longer.  Last year I had gone out to see them when Grandma was getting over brain surgery for a "subdural hematoma" which was the result of a bad fall.  Neither of them had been eating, they couldn't walk and it was very obvious that their retirement community days were over.  I went out a couple months ago to visit them in their "assisted living facility".  It was a very nice place, the people taking care of them were very nice and they were adjusting to life there.  They could both get around with the help of walkers and they were greatly improved from the last time I saw them.  Apparently Grandpa was having a good week, so I am blessed with always remembering him as the feisty ole grandpa that I loved.  I enjoyed telling him about my life and everything that was going on.  He fully encouraged me to feed my love for adventure and moving about.  He told me that before he and grandma had moved to Florida, he had never renewed the lease on any place he had lived.  He understood my need to not be in one place for too long and he told me to live life to the fullest, especially while I was still young.  He even joked about him and grandma "renting" the room they were in now and that they could once again just pick up and go wherever they wanted! About a week ago, he lost his balance and fell onto something hitting his throat.  As a result, he couldn't swallow anything and his gag reflex was gone.  Both he and grandma had a living will and neither wanted to be on machines to be kept alive.  So after 4 days in the hospital, Grandma came in Wednesday morning and was with him when he took his last breath.  I hate that I will never be able to hear my grandpa's voice again.  But I'm happy that he no longer fears Alzheimer’s taking hold of him.  I'm glad that his health didn't deteriorate any more than it had and I'm glad that he still had most of his mind when he left us.  I am selfishly sad that he is gone but I am so happy that my life was blessed with such a great grandpa.  I think tonight I'll dream of crab cakes.

      The other thing that threw my world askew last week is pretty twisted.  A person I know was put in jail.  Now this isn't someone that I would call a friend, they are a work acquaintance.  I see them for a few minutes every day and have random "how's the weather" etc. work chats.  I considered them very nice, quiet, polite, all that good stuff (they were actually a favorite of mine among such work acquaintance's).  After a few days of them not showing up it was brought to my attention that they had been put in jail.  The charge...child molestation and rape.  You always hear people in interviews talk about how the serial killer/unabomber who lived next to them was the nicest person they had ever met.  It doesn't really sink in till someone you know is accused of a heinous crime.  Later details came out that the crime was against a 16 year-old family member, so now the charge is actually "statutory rape"...so it's a little more twisted and a little less heinous...maybe.  Either way, it's creepy, I don't care if this is the South.  I didn't really know the person that well but it still begs the question, "how well do we know people".  Everyone acts differently in front of different people.  What types of shadows are lurking behind people we consider "normal"?  What nasty little secret does the person next to you hide?  How nasty is that little secret?  Summation:  people are strange, I hope to surround myself with the good type of strange.

      So after the weird night of dreaming, my waking hours of Wednesday weren't much better.  My world was thrown slightly askew and it was just fuckin odd!  The first thing happened around lunch time, it began with my cell phone ringing.  I didn't recognize the # but it was local so I went ahead and answered, there was my first mistake.  I said hello and the person introduces themself as an old roomate of mine that I hadn't talked to in about 2 years.  Then she says, "you can hang up on me if you want".  I said no, we can talk (my 2nd mistake) and then followed a really weird 20 minute conversation of "catching up" on the last 2 years.  Why haven't I talked to them in 2 years you might ask...well, that's where the fucked up part comes in.  This chick was a friend of mine for about 4 years, kept in touch w/ them when I moved to Az and when I moved back to Ga I moved in w/ them as a roomate and to save us both a little money.  She was a lesbian and had feelings for me at one point but after we talked and I told her I just couldn't reciprocate she said she was ok and would work it out.  This had been a couple years earlier.  So we're living just outside of Athens and I'm making new friends and trying to find my new niche in the town I had left so many years ago.  After a couple months she starts freaking out on me.  Bitching about me hanging out w/ other people and that I should spend more time with her.  Saying that roomates were supposed to have dinner together every night and hang out together all the time.  (I mentally noted that I didn't remember getting married.)  Anyway, she keeps getting more annoyed w/ me and the situation falls apart pretty quickly.  After 2 weeks of her yelling at me (literally screaming at me) and me just sitting there I found another place to live and told her I would be out in a week.  I come home that night, to find her sobbing on the bathroom floor.  She had tried to kill herself and said I was completely to blame for her crappy life.  She was forgetting momentarily about the abusive father she has who used to beat her when she was too small to defend herself and now settles for just making her feel like crap every chance he gets.  I knew she had her issues and that hopefully she would get help for them but I knew that I couldn't help and just need to get out.  Oh yeah, and she had kicked my little basset hound puppy across the room...that's just fucked up.  You can yell at me and take swings at me, but don't you dare go after my babies.  So I left her behind and pretty much wrote her off to what fucked up parents can do to a person.  Then she calls me yesterday to tell me she was sorry for all the nasty things she said to me (I was cruel to people, all I wanted to do was hurt people...that's why I didn't keep relationships, blah, blah, blah) and that she had finally turned a corner and was doing better.  I told her that's great and not to worry about it cause I hadn't held a grudge.  Now she wants to be friends again.  I'm thinking I shouldn't go down that road again.  I think we'll just end up in the same place and I'm to old for that drama!   :) This story took a little to long to type, so the other fucked up thing will have to wait till my next post.  I will tell you that it involves someone going to jail.  Oh yeah, my life is interesting.

      I went to bed last night at a reasonable hour but when my alarm went off this morning it took everything I had to get out of bed!  And it wasn't because I had a pretty boy beside me (which is always the best excuse to throw the alarm clock across the room).  It feels like I spent all last night dreaming.  I remember quite a bit of the dream, it was very detailed and very freakin long.  I even woke up a couple times during the night (never drink 4 cups of tea right before you go to bed) and when I would fall back into bed the dream would pick up right where it left off.  I have always loved dreaming.  I'm one of those people who fly alot in their dreams and rarely do I have nightmares (I save bad situations for real-life).  My dreams are always vivid (at least the ones I remember) and a few times I've had to try to figure out whether something really happened or it was just a dream.  I guess that comes along w/ having a very active imagination or maybe it's just a human thing.  When I watch movies, I don't try to figure out the plot, I just let the story take me along with it...same goes for dreams.  But this is the second time in the past week that I've had a dream where I woke up totally tired the next day cause I was so damn busy in the dream!  I've never been able to control what I dream about though, I've tried thinking about something/someone alot before I go to bed but when it's intentional I just don't dream about them.  If that was the case, every morning I'd be tired cause I was busy playing w/ a pretty boy all night long!  Now that's what I call a good, long dream.

      What is the recipe for a kick ass weekend you might ask...well, let me tell you.  Take a couple old friends, a couple new friends, 2 damn good movies, some awesome pool and stir together with a bit of alcohol and there you have it!  Friday consisted of me and a new friend getting piss ass drunk and going to see Harold & Kumar go to white castle w/ a few old friends.  I LOVE that movie.  I'm weird when it comes to my love of dumb movies and this ranks really high on Kris's awesome dumb movie list.  A trip to KFC (or church's chicken since it was closer) was mandatory afterwards, seriously, be prepared to be craving some kind of food etc. after that movie.  Then we all hung out in a park eating our biscuits and chicken and staring at the full (blue) moon.  Great night.  Saturday saw me taking it easy/recovering from the previous night.  I did meet w/ a friend for a few pool games in the afternoon.  This is a person who usually beats me but not on Saturday my friends.  We played 4 games and I WON EVERY GAME!  In 2 of the games we were both fighting for the 8 ball and I got it first, but on 2 of the other games he still had 3 balls on the table when I pocketed the 8 ball!  I was so damn happy.  That night I went downtown (w/ new and old friends) to see a great bluegrass band named Cast Iron Filter.  They were good stuff and a good time was had by all.  Sunday I played pool again w/ another friend.  I usually end up winning against him so 7 games to his 1 didn't rank as high as Saturday's games.  But I was happy that I actually appear to be getting better and it's not a fluke or something.  Later I went and saw The Village...that movie was totally awesome!  I was on the fence as to whether I would see it in the movie theater cause I don't deal well w/ stuff jumping out at me.  I prefer watching scary movies on video cause it's easier to divert your attention when the creepy stuff comes out of the shadows.  I'm so glad I saw this movie in the theater!  It was amazing and Shyamalan once again proved that he totally kicks ass!  The plot was great, I totally didn't see the twists coming and the creepy parts were done very well.  All in all, it was a totally kick ass weekend that I thoroughly enjoyed!  I plan on having more of those.
