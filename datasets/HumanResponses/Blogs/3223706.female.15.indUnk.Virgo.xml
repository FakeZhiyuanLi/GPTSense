        back to nothing    welll, i cant think of a single thing that happened all day that would be worth commenting on....i suppose i could say something about my recital......i was pretty damn nervous because i hadnt had enough time to practice it to the point where i was totally comfortable. while i was practicing, i kept getting stuck in spots. well, at the recital, i played it, and i played it well. no mistakes, other than a few off-notes because of clammy hands and slippery fingers. there is no sweeter sound than the burst of applause that comes after playing a piece and knowing that u fucking nailed that bitch. huge weight off my shoulders.....unexpected phone call, took up some time, so i guess i'm done, off to bed.....tomorrow's finally friday. this was one of those endless weeks.....

        icky sticky my sweet ooey gooey    well, today was britts bday and i guess its a significant day in my life because she's my best friend and we're practically the same person....except we're really different. anyways, i didnt buy her anything fancy, but like i made her alotta stuff, (like that beautiful picture of me, her, and lucy that i colored.) so i'm hoping i brought her some birthday cheer. other than that, today was relatively mundane, as are most days. i should probably be reading m book for my english paper rite now...but thats too much work....maybe i'll just rent the movies. ha how lazy....and how is it that everyone always leaves me online at the same time? i'm left here rambling on in my blog like i actually have something interesting to say, when we all know thats not true. i'd like to think i was profound and hilarious...but sadly i am neither.....i suppose its time to go.....i should be practicing my piano piece for my recital tomorrow. i'm that nerd who still takes piano lessons....and damn do i love playing piano....its one of my passions. eh, maybe i'll leave after i listen to this britney spears song one more time.....its sooo good!!! (haha yeah i get extra nerd points there, dont i?)

        A Rush of Blood to the Head     in this blog, i usually try to refrain from bitching, but i really cant help it rite now. i just need to get it out. i have been really happy for several weeks, and for no reason, just things were nice and relatively uneventful, nothing bad happening. but yesterday all of a sudden, it hit me. that depression that always seems to creep up on my without warning. it tends to be when i think that this is it, i'm actually gonna be happy now. i felt like shit, and just lay in bed all day. why did i feel so bad????? i have no idea. i just didnt want to talk to anyone, and i couldnt stop thinking about how worthless i am. i've been doing that thing where i keep taking down my mirror then put it back up again. i just dont enjoy looking at myself anymore. i used to think i was pretty, and maybe i used to be, and i have gotten progressively uglier as the years have gone on. i feel so inferior next to friends, family, almost everyone. i feel like i dont have much going for me, and thats why guys dont like me. i wonder how long it will last this time....i mean i just dont know what i can do to pull myself out of it. well, hopefully something good will happen, thats usually how i get rid of it, but its not really my control. so i'm praying it will happen.

        idiots are taking over     damn it, i hate people! not all people, just the people that steal cd players outta people's cars. but at least the bastards were polite enough to lock the door when they were done. so here's my wednesday afternoon adventure:  the three young friends set out to do some thrift store shopping one warm wednesday, about 4 o clock. little did they know that they would soon be the victims of a heinous crime. they entered the village discount and shopped for a half hour, laughing and enjoying themselves the entire time. zac bought some very nice clothes for his aunt's upcoming wedding, and erika bought some tremendously snazzy spectacles. they are nice and thick, about 3 inches tall. bifocals. she looks like quite the sex goddess in them. the three teens exit the store, and walk to the 89 ford tempo. they unlock the doors, sit down, and erika notices there are only wires where zac's stereo used to be. they all immediately start swearing excessively. zac even yells out the window, "who the fuck took my cd player???!!!" zac proceeds to call the police while britt and erika go to all the surrounding stores trying to find out if anyone saw anything suspicious. they come up with nothing, except for a eye care employee who seems very "fishy." they wait for a cop in the parking lot for what seems like an eternity. suddenly a gargantuan gust of wind rolls through the parking lot, stirring up dust, twigs, and other unwanted particles. the three are attacked. a shopping cart comes rifling towards them at a speed of at least 90 mph. zac, being the brave man that he is, protected the girls and kicked the cart away, at the expense of his own shins. what a gentleman.  your humble narrator is getting tired and still hasnt started her algebra hw, so she will habe to leave the story at this. there really wasnt anything interesting left to say anyways.

        rain     there's something about bad weather that makes me happy. when i say bad weather, i mean rain. which isnt bad, but it seems to be to alot of other people. there are so many people that hide when its raining, like they're scared. A little water never hurt anyone. i embrace the rain. it's beautiful. i feel like its washing everything away. i love being out in the rain. i feel so cute and vibrant and happy, like i wanna run and scream. it's been raining the past couple of days, and i've loved it. and if it rains tomorrow, i dont know if its supposed to or not, i promise to go outside and take a walk.    today was enjoyable. i went shopping, again. i bought too much...but i dont really have many shorts, and thats mainly what i got. i saw my childhood friend's mom at the mall. she's such a sweetheart, we talked for like 15 minutes. it reminded me of all the good times i had with sam, i miss them. we still hung out after she moved to dundee, but it slowly dwindled. it was probably my fault. i tend to do that, without even noticing it. i'll im her next time i see her on. i went out to eat at applebees today with lisa, lucy, and britt. then we went to see 13 going on 30. i didnt think i was gonna like it that much, but i loved it. i was crying my ass off. the heartless bitch two rows ahead of me was laughing at me. what a whore. i'm sorry i have a little sentiment. she was obviously in the wrong movie. i felt like saying that the heartless bitch movie was actually in theater 12. afterwards, we went to culvers. i had run out of money by this time, so i just kinda ate some of lisas and britts. yum, i love culvers. then we went to lucys, and lay on her bed and talked, and laughed, god it was fun. one of those nights you couldnt make better if you tried. everything was just right.

        The Whistle Song    well, today i heard something that i never wanted to hear in my life. I never even wanted to think about hearing it. i never even wanted anyone else to have to hear it. My spanish teacher tells me, jeanne, and annalise all this personal information that i guess we dont really care about, but i guess its pretty interesting since her life is so messed up. so she's been telling us about this guy shes dating....he lives at her house now....he's kind of a bum. but yeah so basically she told us that they've been having sex. ewww!!!!! i mean, whatever, of course i knew it was happening....but i really didnt need her to tell me. yuck yuck yuck bad visions!!!! ewww!!! ahhh!!!!!!! i needed to write in my blog to vent on it. i mean seriously, thats really personal information, i would not wanna tell a class of sophomores about it. that woman has no respect for herself. she's had a pretty rough life, so i understand why she's such a weird-ass. i kinda feel bad for her, she gets so much shit from everyone all day long. and does she deserve it? well yeah i suppose some of it. it seems like she's teaching just so she can have another chance at enjoying high school, not because she wants to help kids learn. she's too interested in being our friend. then she lost control of all her classes and they all treat her like crap. she brought it on herself, but it's still a bad situation. but honestly......if she tells me one more personal detail about her sex life, i will vomit, all over her!!!!!!   well, moving on to a slightly less sickening subject, i played ddr for the first time in a while today. it was fun, i still love that game. i'm not as good as i used to be, just outta practice. i played a little too long, now my legs are sore, but at least i did some aerobic exercise hehe. and yeah, the whistle song is the best ddr song.....its so dirty!!!!! just guess what the word whistle if referring to....

        Once upon a time     finally, my cd arrived. i was so excited, i tore open the packaging and put it in rite away, i had already listened to the whole thing before britt arrived, and then we listened to it again. it was my first weekday since track ended, and i enjoyed having the whole afternoon to do whatever i wanted. i did this: ~ate shrimp cocktail ~listened to my new cd ~made sno-cones ~played mario for super nintendo we enjoyed it very much, and i look forward to many more lazy afternoons filled with laughter with one of my dearest friends. now that my cd is here, one period of waiting has ended, only to let another begin. the 2nd half of the 2 part season finale of the inferno is next monday.....argh....i wanna see it sooo bad, but i know i'll forget about it by tomorrow, so i'm not bothered.  i was having a discussion with my brother about his ex girlfriend today, and it left me feeling rather unsettled. she apparently has gotten into drugs, and i'm not talking the casual weekend weed and alcohol. I mean drugs of a more frightening variety. my brother heard it through the grapevine, and he is very upset. but he knows there is nothing he can do to help. He is no longer a part of her life. it makes me sad,i mean the two of them used to be my hope. they were proof that relationships can work, and love can be all its cracked up to be in the movies. It can make you happy and change your whole life. but what happens when it ends? most often at least one of the two parties is left in a mess, sad and worried that they will never be normal again. was the relationship worth the pain? is it worth the risk? sometimes i feel that it is better not to get attached, if you dont care about someone you cant get hurt, correct? but then what happens when you need someone....who will be there if you dont let anyone close to you? i suppose love is just inevitable...i mean we dont really choose it do we? we can try to deny it, but the feeling will still be there. perhaps it is better to just embrace it. no use fighting something that will always beat you.

        Give You Back     i am in a wonderful mood, and i have been all weekend. why, you ask? well because nothing has gone wrong....which in my opinion means that everything is going right. i feel really materialistic, but going on a good shopping trip always makes my day. i bought alot of stuff for summer/hawaii today......and i almost got excited for it, but then i remembered that i'm not gonna have a good time. well i dunno, maybe i will. eh i dont feel like typing about it, i'm already talking to jeanne about it as we speak. i suppose i'll be bitching about it plenty as the trip grows nearer. and in the meantime, i'm having plenty of fun here in elgin. summer's almost here, i will finally be freed from the shackles of school. i will no longer have to worry about papers, homework, and tests. all i'll have to worry about is having fun...well that and getting over my fear of flying...before we go to hawaii. time for bed, i'm becoming delirious.

        This Beautiful Mess    note(s) to self: stop eating coconut popsicles while u are online. that makes it really difficult to type.  a cobbler is a shoemaker....before you forget again. you always look it up, and then you forget..well not this time.  people are insanely generous to random people online. proof of this: my rating on hotornot.com is 7.3   o yeah and if you feel like u have something to say, by all means, i am willing to share the spotlight. It has recently come to my attention that you can leave notes on my blog. now i know this didnt end up well last time i did it, but i believe things have changed. so comment if you wish.

        love-lit eyes    monday, the week has begun....and i couldnt miss the weekend more. summer is so close i can taste it, but then the taste is washed away by the bitter schoolweek. i handed in my english paper today, its hideous, disgusting, terrible, horrendous. i'll prolly still get a B though. actually, i NEED to get a B. good ol' jim crinigan wouldnt fail me now, would he? not after finding out that we bought his house from him. i mean, without us, maybe that house would still be for sale. meh, mindless babbling in an attempt to ease my worries. so we had a track meet today, and lemme tell you, we have the saddest girls team ever to walk the planet. not that each individual girl is bad or anything, but there are only 5 of us. and when the whole team (except for me) goes home with their parents after the meet and only one girl and the coach are left to ride a large van home, its pitiful. i really must be going now, time to switch sn's and order the latest flo cd, its been out for like 2 months, but i havent had money, and i couldnt find it at first....i cant wait till i get it, it better not disappoint me....i hate bands that progressively get worse as they gain more popularity.

        i'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me    3 day weekends are nice....very nice. thank you prom for giving me a day off. i made the day worthwhile, if i do say so myself. i ate mcdonalds for breakfast, quite tasty. then i had a coconut popsicle...amazing, i'm addicted. then i played piano for a long time until i went to the mall with brit. today i actually had money. i bought a tank top, a skirt, perfume, and ice cream. i'd say i did pretty well. i love perfume. for almost every perfume i've had, there is a memory to go with it. by just taking a whiff will practically transport me back to the place where i was wearing it. like the perfume i just ran out of reminds me of my last trip to mexico. when i smell it, i can see myself sitting in my cousin's bedroom, putting on perfume and make-up....watching spanish tv shows, and waiting to hear the sweet sound of the doorbell announcing the arrival of my mexico boyfriend. bittersweet memories because i dont know when i'll be going back. well, enough of that, i feel sufficiently sappy. i believe i'm gonna go back to my mortal kombat game....i'm addicted...it gives me a chance to kick the shit outta people. i have a lot of pent-up anger.

        green apple kool-aid    i am a procrastinator....always have been, prolly always will be. i am convinced that it is an incurable condition. you see, we have an english paper due wednesday. we've known about it for months. i've known what books i was going to read for at least a month. when did i start reading? well.....lets try today. around 2 o clock. i opened up a copy of clockwork orange, and now i am immersed in it. this is one of the few short breaks i have taken from reading it. its compelling. not exactly a happy book, but then again, the books that i am drawn to rarely are. i love it, and i am glad i chose to read it. too bad i didnt start reading it earlier....but thats alrite, i'm over halfway done with it and i am not even remotely tired yet. maybe i'll even polish off the book before going to bed....that would be nice. now the real problem lies in the fact that i have to read two books for this blessed little project....and i picked another real classic....unfortunately, it is an amazingly long classic....the pickwick papers by charles dickens. it checks in at about 600 pages......600 pages that i have to read by wednesday...well read AND write a paper on by wednesday....an almost impossible feat considering i have to go to school, and track practice both tomorrow and tuesday. so i go to the bookstore looking for cliffnotes, or sparknotes, or "study guides"..whatever you choose to call them. to my dismay, they had nothing for the pickwick papers. and to my knowledge, there is no movie based on the damn book. at the moment, it looks like i am up the creek without a paddle. or a boat for that matter. and i dont know how to swim. if you happen to see me as you are passing by, please bail me out of the school project creek.

        so here i go, so dishonestly     wow, its been a long time since i've written. i'm not quite sure why, i suppose its because i havent been going online much lately....i dunno. but yeah its summer now. sweet glorious summer, the stuff 9 months' worth of dreams are made of. it started out slow, i had a cold then an ear infection, but rite now my summer seems to be going pretty well. one of the highlights so far has been going to see the plain white t's. they're one of my favorites, and it was an amazing show! i was only one row from the front. i sang along with all the songs i knew, i was dancing around like crazy. yes i know i looked like a loser, but i honestly did not care, i was that happy. i hope sex is that good. i hope to see more of my favorite bands in concert. now when i listen to the plain white t's cd....the songs sound even better than before, like i remember the concert, and its just great. but yeah, other things i have done this summer....well, there is one rather amusing story from drivers ed, but i am fairly tired at the moment and i would like to be able to tell the story in its entirety. i guess it shall have to wait till tomorrow.

        all different directions     where has my time gone? i'm leaving for hawaii in 5 days.....i feel like just yesterday i was taking finals. now its already july. i havent done that much with my summer....i mean, the highlights would be going to see the plain white t's....and drivers ed (i have my reasons, i promise). well some of my laughing fits with britt are pretty memorable. i know that hawaii is gonna end up being the best part of my summer. i mean, it just has to be. i'm really excited now, but still scared as hell. i fuckin hate flying....its gonna be scary. i really dont feel comfortable when i'm suspended in mid-air over the ocean. my aunt told me to think of it as floating up in the clouds. thats a lot more peaceful. i dunno, more and more i seem to be living in anxiety. and i really dont like it. i'm always looking over my shoulder. i'm always checking under my bed and in my closet. i cant even sleep with the lights off. and when they're on, i'm still scared. every little sound i hear makes my heart race. i dont like being home alone. even in the middle of the afternoon. i dont know what it is......i mean nothing has happened that would make me this scared. maybe it will go away eventually. enough of that depressing subject......today was a good day, i worked for 6 hours then went to colonial with annie, zac, and adam. it was fun.....and i got to eat ice cream, which always makes me happy. then we got pizza and me, zac, and adam went back to zacs. we watched the rest of the virgin suicides. it was good. but adam, who does not know how to appreciate a good movie, thought it was stupid. he's just not intelligent enough for it, hehe. but yeah i asked corbin to come with us to get ice cream. but he said he couldnt...i hope its true and that he wasnt just avoiding it. because i kinda miss him already. we had alotta fun in drivers ed....and i dunno, he kinda grew on me and i do like him. and he could even be reading this because i mean he does have my sn and this link is in my profile...but you know what? i dont care. if he couldnt tell i like him he's not very perceptive at all. o yeah, i almost forgot. i have this new thing called audioblogger and now i can leave voice messages onto my blog. so instead of reading my insanely boring entries, you can listen to them!!!! then you'll have the added bonus of my cracking voice! i swear, my voice is almost done changing. someday i'll be through with puberty.
