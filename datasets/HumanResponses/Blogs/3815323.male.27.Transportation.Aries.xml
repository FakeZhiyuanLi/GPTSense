      Wow... came back yesterday evening from my Genting trip. Tired and all worned out. Guess what me and my friends did???  Mahjong from 8pm till 4am!!!!! then continue from 9am till 5pm..  Are we seriously need our brain check?? The weather there was terrific. Not too crowded.   Casino was great too. not as smoky as the previous trip i had last time. We had steambot (tomyam)  there which was just nice for the cold atmosphere.

      Someone has asked me how frequent i update my blog? why having a blog when not updated?  Hmmm... having a blog is having fun or lousy mood at your own space and share with your friends. Of cos timing is the main factor of updating it... plus.... the owner of this blog is slightly lazy and not to mention being amature on the blog.  Of cos fell and got myself a bad arm (thx for the person who pushed me - ehehhee just joking) has given me a time to relax more.   Not knowing what to write is anothing... my life S**ks... as boring as Beat having during saturday...   So guys.... tell me why do you have a blog?

      Things don't seemed to be what you always wanted to be. We plan, we persue the plan & we fail at times. Hmm.. what a world.  What happenned today?  I have been ignored. What a bummer!!   Gee.... what else to say tonight?   Funny world.... accused killer released? Hero killed trying to help? Grandma killed for RM10? Is it safe to even live here anymore?  What happenned to those were the days where we could run around the neighbourhood without fear being kidnapped?   is this going to be it or worst to come??

      Damn.... damn!!!!! when u want to have some fruits you dont get it. but when u not free the fruit will be available for you. What is this???? Is this a sign of ' Not your cup of tea'?  *Sigh*  But i realise this fruit is getting sweeter & sweeter recently and not as difficult to eat. Although chances of getting this fruit is not easy, but still will treasure the feel of having it.

      Here am i again blogging after sometime missing in action. Why the long time no blog? Busy? nah..... thats just lame excuse.. Lazy should be the correct word.  Had really good week last week.... although have some good news and some bad news but overall its a good one.  Remember that once someone has said before that listening to some songs could easily make u cry. I disagree at first but now i have experienced that really true that some song could really make tears comes from your eyes if you really understand the lyrics. But some songs also can make your bad day to a happy day. Well, I have found my songs.  Career? what a mess...

      What have i learnt ?  The Beginning and The End 1. Babies were born and people dies every second. 2. A couple started a relationship and end it recently after one year. 3. People survive from fatal accident and still losing their life to drugs. 4. A couple gave birth to 3 young ones and taken the life of all 3. 5. A couple wanted to start a life together and end up ending their life against their will.  6. Miracle survival after fell from 3rd floor with broken arm n leg but still dies 4 hours later.  Why does all beginning must have an ending? Is there any beginning without and end?  Will our friendship that has started will end too??  What should we do?
