       urlLink ilovebees  phase 3 kicks in tomorrow when the "axons go hot".  Should be interesting.  Another  urlLink layout  made. Lots of Perfect Dark played. Wish Rare would hurry up with the Xbox version, the N64 controls get on my nerves now being used to the Gamecube and Xbox control pads.  Looks like Gameplay are gonna make alot of money out of me. Animal Crossing                      Pre-Ordered  £33.98 Counter Strike Condition Zero        Complete  £20.98 Pokemon Leaf Green                   Pre-Ordered  £27.98 Logic 3 ScreenBeat Headphones + Mic  Ordered  £6.98 Star Wars Battlefront                Pre-Ordered  £27.98 Halo 2                               Pre-Ordered  £30.98  Whole lotta gaming goodness.

      Four days to go. Wish it'd hurry up.  Today: Made a new  urlLink layout  for no particular reason.  Managed to come first in an online game of Halo PC, by a good margin too.  Watched Boro get beat off Arsenal 5-3 after being 3-1 up, great game anyway.  Finished the Defender for  urlLink 2021 , but can't show that, top secret...

      Finished  urlLink Halo PC  today, did The Maw on the first try with a few flips but I still finished with just over a minute to spare. Nothing left to do now but multiplayer. Probably do some more of  urlLink Ground Control 2 . There's a long time til Halo 2...  Revora's server is down, yet again. So no  urlLink Origin / urlLink CNC Guild / urlLink Forums  until it wakes up, which might be a long time. Ah well, there's always  urlLink Sleip's .  A few of the  urlLink bee keepers  have  just  figured out that the  urlLink countdown  will finish for everyone, everywhere at the same time because it works out using their PC clocks.  Always seemed blindingly obvious to me, but there you go.  I'm going to  try  and be up at 6 on Tuesday to be online when the countdown finishes on my PC, but everything will most likely have happened by then with me being in the UK.  Or will I be early?  Can't be pestered figuring it out, but I sure as hell won't be on time.

      I now have somewhere to rant.  Playing alot of Halo lately, getting drawn into the whole  urlLink ilovebees  thing too. More specifically, I've been working my way though the PC version of Halo and am currently up to Keys but can't kill all the Flood I find when I drop into the coolant pools. I also did The Maw on the Xbox version again (on Normal instead of being a wuss and choosing easy like last time) which I stuffed up once or twice before I managed to finish it with plenty of time remaining to run to the Longsword and escape. On the subject of ilovebees i've been looking at the screwed-up images in wordpad and collecting the words and parts of sentences hidden in there. Someone has probably already done this but it gave me something to do.  On a Halo-unrelated subject, pretty much finished the  urlLink Dimewest  website. Just need the content for the Case Studies page.  Still waiting for a delivery from Forbidden Planet, though it's only been two days and it can take up to twenty-eight. Hopefully i'll be receiving a Grunt (of Halo fame) figure, a Drop Ship (of Aliens fame) model, a poster by Giger and a remote control Yoshi car (of Nintendo fame, in a car) for my sister.  One other thing, got a trailer for the new GTA game today and it basically sucks.  The trailer shows nothing happening of interest, just some people walking/driving around really.  Not like i'd buy it anyway mind. Also got the Halo 2 cinema trailer, there's at least a bit of action in there but its a poor trailer. Luckily, there's other much better videos around that encouraged me to pre-order.
