      This feels like the longest week ever! it's only frikin tuesday! It's late at night and I'm saying things like ZOOP.  I have been so weird today.  At any available moment I have been making high-pitched noises and I have no clue why.  It reminds me of me as a 9th grader, I was the weirdest kid then.  I would do anything random at any time pretty much.  I was weird and I embrased that fact.  I have no doubt gotten weirder but when did I start keeping it on the inside more? I hate it, it feels like I'm in a cage or my own normalcy.  I used to question everything that interested me, everything.  That's why today has been so weird cuz I also started questioning things like I used to.   *STOP HERE IF YOU ARE DUMB* Randomly in the car today I was talking to my mom and I realized that life and time is 49.999999999 something percent experiance, 49.9999999999 something percent expectation, and .00000000001 something percent right now (even if that).  Experiance is everything in our past, and you think you're past has little to do with you but it doesnt, its half of your life...the rest is expectation, what you look foward to, what you have in your future to do, thats really what makes us live...we thrive on expectation, it's like a drug.  andwe always think that the present is so important but when you really think about it right now is tiny...its pretty much going in a split second from past to future....past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future....HOLY CRAP! and that's our life...thats it.  Now that I've depressed myself, goodbye

      This is the end of the second week of summer and I already feel like I'm wasting it.  I have done absolutely nothing redeeming today.  Maybe for a feeling of accomplishment I will call Quill and Press to see if I got a job...Ok they're closed.  I talked to someone at least! And they know I'm persistent! =) I'm feeling kind of down right now I don't know why.  Maybe I need some caffine or to watch some tv or read my book...So, I'm off to do one of those things, bye.

      Just got back from RI, I had fun.  I watched The Butterfly Effect last night, I LOVE THAT MOVIE SO MUCH.  That movie follows my theories exactly, like the whole chaos theory it was based on.  Something like the flutter of the wing of a butterfly could result in a typhoon on the other side of the world.  I am a firm believer in stuff like that, any time someone wants to debate that I would be happy to.  Like small tiny things that happen can cause huge things to no matter how small the connection.  It's great isn't it? I wanna see that movie again, I loved it.  haha I just thought of something funny that happened today at dinner. My mom and my dad got calamari and my dad was talking about it and all of a sudden he says, "Wow it's amazing how many testicles they gave us" of course meaning tenticles.  His face turned bright red and robyn and I could not stop laughing.  That wasn't it later he picked up one of them and said (unknowingly of course), "Wow this puss is really big!" HAHAHA (sorry dad I had to put it in! =S ) so, that was wicked wicked funny...

      I'm so tired...last night we stayed upn till 5:30 and had to get up at 8:30.  Then after that I had to watch alex and max, thankfully I could convince alex that we should take a nap.  I'm going to RI tonight, that should be fun, I just got a new bathing suit so I can go swimming tonight =).  Gotta go pack for the night.

      I love this book! For those of you (from Caritas) who are trying to pick a summer reading book, definately read I,Robot.  It's so good, I started reading it yesterday and I'm almost half way through, it's wicked good.  another good recommendation is the princess and the goblin, I read it last year...if you read that, though your second summer book has to be the princess and curdie.  They are really better than they sound.  So, I'm trying to figure out what is going no today so I better get going.

      So far my summer has been ok, I've done a lot of things with my friends and also have had a chance to relax.  This is one of those times where I don't mind being me or where I am right now in my life.  These times are few and far between.  Some of the bad things are kind of being pushed out of my head like the people I thought were friends but really turned out to be complete fakes (I can't stand people like that) it all just made me value my real friends more and want to be a better friend to them.  In this 1st week of summer I have also gotten a chance to spend more time with Alex and Max, I love them so much.  Max has been going to a speech coach cuz he isn't talking yet.  I think it's a bunch of crap, he just doesn't want to talk.  And now everyone's questioning his hearing, too.  They don't understand that he can hear us when we are talking to him he just doesn't care, a lot like me in that way.  I also didn't start talking till I was like 18 months and I didn't turn out that messed up.  You can also look at it this way, the sooner they talk the sooner they talk back.  It's all good =)

      Blog is a weird word...not as weird at doing cuz I could be saying  do-ing or *DOING* like the cartoon sound when someone gets hit in the face....they are spelt the same way.  I started thinking about this after watching a strongbad email, check it out.  so, anyways today is fathers day and I got my dad the guiness book of world records, it's wicked cool.  one of the records kind of disappointed me; a man once ate 4 hot dogs in 3 minutes! what's great about that? seriously, someone break that record! I found i,Robot by Isaac Asimov at the book store today, wicked exciting, it looks wicked good.  I am gonna read the book then see the movie, it'll be great I tell you (it's also a summer reading list book). Seeing Troy got me to start reading The Iliad by Homer, I love it so much.  It's wicked different than the movie tho. They hardly even talk about how the whole helen thing came about.  Also, the timeline is all screwed up in the movie.  anyways I love the Iliad so far, I recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it already.  I'm also trying to get through That Hideous strength by C.S. Lewis, everything is leading up to something interesting but so far it hasn't happened yet. Its wicked tedious, hopefully not for long.  Tonight I think we are gonna watch U-571, my sister gave it to my dad for fathers day, it looks good.  I'll post again soon. BYE

        YAY! I'm going to young life camp with Sasha on the 31st.&nbsp; I'm wicked excited, it's gonna be&nbsp;SO   frikin &nbsp; fun.&nbsp; There's so much to do there and I can get a chance to do some badly needed work on my   relationship with God.&nbsp; I just went back to church this week for the first time in 2 months.&nbsp; The   1st month I was doing sunday school and the second month so much crap came up every sunday   like no one in my family went...theres no excuse tho! I feel wicked bad and like I haven't been   fed spiritually at all which is completely my fault.&nbsp; Hopefully this week at&nbsp;YL camp will help.&nbsp; I   also haven't been to my guitar lesson since the week b4 Quebec which was the beginning   of   June.&nbsp; I'm a retard...I have been working on stuff with my guitar, tho.&nbsp; I'm working on Moonlight   Sonata and I've written 2 guitar parts off of a tab I found online, IT IS THE AWESOMEST   THING EVER! I'm so excited about it.&nbsp; I still haven't decided if I should write words for it. &nbsp;   Probably not, &nbsp;it'll be fine the way it is and words would probably cheapen it.&nbsp;

      goin to see King Arthur tonight then sleepin at Sasha's tonight.  I have never been so excited to see a movie b4 I can't wait.  I still need a job but I just recently got my refund check from the Quebec trip ($115 baby!) that was a biiig help.  I need a new cell phone cuz my battery doesn't even last a couple frikin hours ne more.  A new battery would cost $50 so we thought it would be less expensive to just get a new phone. I went to Radio Shack to check out new cell phones but it turns out Sprint is a butt monkey and has all these hidden charges for existing customers.  For a new customer the phone I liked would be something like $59 but since I already have Sprint it's like $199 or some crazy price like that!  I was wicked mad.  They have the best phones around but they're stupid and they only allow you to send pics and stuff through them so you can't put pics on the comp or ne thing.  They're greedy little butts...oh well...

      Hey everybody! Man this has been one crazy week...on Saturday I went down to Connecticut with my family to camp with Anthony's (Kristen's bf) family, and had the best time. On Tuesday I left there to ocme back to Robyn's house to stay with Alex and Max for 3 days while her and Edwin went to the Cape for their anniversary.  Longest 3 days ever.  I love my nephews to death but they can be real crazy sometimes.  At least I now know that I can keep a 4 year old and a 1 year old alive for 3 days.  Pretty good, eh?  ne ways on Thursday I went back down to CT with katy and stayed till this morning.  We camped at this wicked cool place and I got to drive a golf cart around a lot, that was sick.  On the lake they also had this slide with water coming down it that was wicked high and when you got to the bottom you would skid across the water.  I loved it.  I also found out that this 20 year old guy I met on sunday thinks I'm cute!  That was a little confidence boost =) but ne ways I wicked wanna see Kind Arthur! I had Alex and Max on Wednesday so I couldn't go to it.  This week definately! =)

      not much new here since the last post...I'm continuing on my weird streak.  I had more crazy thoughts about life and time last night hanging out with people...it's comforting to know that other people think about some of these things too.  I'm trying to get my parents to let me go to the beach on sunday for the 4th.  That'd suck if they didn't let me, I'd be so sad.  If I don't go then I'll go to CT for the weekend with my family.  I have a pen on my desk that says "This pen has been stolen from Michael's Shoe Store."  I thought that was kinda funny.  I am desperately in need of something fun to do right now I'm wicked bored...

      Last night was so fun...I went to young life last night for a slide show of camp pictures...I enjoyed that, there were a few embarrassing pics of me but w/e. After that sasha, mia, sasha's friend beth and I went to CC USA to meet up with my sis and some guys I played on Saturday. We had so much fun. It was almost 12 so we start to leave and the guy we were playing says "this was fun we should hang out sometime." So we're like ya that'd be cool. So we left and were on the way to Nashoba to drop beth at her car when I thought "How are we gonna hang out I didn't even give him my number?" So I call my sister and was like "will you ask that kid if he wants my number?" and she says "ya he does he asked for it when you left." So I was excited about that and we're gonna hang out sometime and maybe play some more pool. Oh ya and when we left the pool hall sasha needed gas wicked bad. So we pull into the gas station, sasha goes in and tells the lady what pump we're at and the lady tells her that we are at the wrong pump and that its closed so we have to go to the other side of the station. We went over there and sasha and beth went to get the pump out and put it in the tank but the thing wouldn't work. It was taking forever and MIa and I were like what the heck are they doing? It turns out they forgot to lift the holder....It was pretty funny, they were laughing so hard they couldn't even talk. It might have been something you have to be there for but it was wicked funny at the time. After that we went to sasha and mias house and stayed up till like 3 or something. It was a fun night.

Oh man I'm gonna miss the seniors so bad...I didn't really remember how much fun we actually had in our classes till I read that.             "There's going to be no Pat to take things the wrong way and get us all to laugh, no Lars to crack stupid jokes, no Celeste to complain so much people tell her to shut up, no James to cringe at Lars' and Pat's off color jokes, and no Megan to laugh so hard she starts to cry. "         Oh man I'm gonna cry again....Those were really good times =/ Definately during vacations we'll be hangin out and stuff guys....

          today, like almost every day this week was very uneventful. I woke up, did some laundry, took      a shower, and played with my nephews a little. I'm gonna go play pool tonight with my sis and   maybe beat/pick up some guys, lol. I was gonna go with a bunch of my friends but it didn't work   out. If anyone sees this and wants to join call my cell (978)-853-8065...We'll be at Country Club    USA in Chelmsford. It's not actually a country club, it's a pool hall. I am in the most boring   mood right now it sux...It'll be better once I'm playing pool. Tomorrow I'm going to my   grandparents church to sing for my grandfather's retirement, he played the organ at their church   for a long time. After that I think I'll go to this bible study this woman at my church has on   Sundays. She came up to me last week and asked me to go, it sounds ok.   Monday I'm going to   the Lake Champion Slide Show. After that this week is up in the air, I guess I should start on   my other summer reading list book. There you go the most boring entry ever.

      Don't you hate when you go to bed at about 1 or something then can't sleep past 9? This morning I just couldn't go back to sleep so I got up and watched Les Mis. I thought it was really well made, I had never seen the movie of it b4, only the play. I liked it a lot. Last night I went to a kind of goodbye party for Zach he's leaving on Sunday for Patrick Henry college in Virginia. It's sad to think about, I'm gonna miss him and the rest of the seniors that graduated this year, well most of the seniors at least. I still feel like I should have gone out with them...It kinda sux and I know I've been whining about this for a long time but why are you guys leaving me behind! haha jk...I'm happy for you guys. I just want to get out of school as soon as possible and I'm doing most of the same crap this year that I have been doing for like 3 years now. 16-19 century history and English? You're kidding me right? I've frikin done it! At least I get to do anatomy and physiology. I'm gonna have a sucky year, I really am. We're gonna have another class of 5 seniors this year, 3 full time, 2 part time. All right let me talk about something interesting....umm, well right now on the guitar I'm working on empty apartment by yellowcard. It's going pretty well but I seriously messed up the tuning on my electric and my tuner is in my mom's car in NH. I tried it on my acoustic a little and got farther on it but then I realized my teachers notes for the next part were also in the car, so I'm putting it on hold for a couple hours. I'm still kinda working on moonlight sonata on my electric, I gotta admit it sounds pretty sweet. I know it sounds kinda doing a classical song on the guitar but believe me, it's an awesome song and even more awesome on the guitar. Well I'm out for now, bye

      I just spent like an hour filling out an electronic job application at CVS, it was the stupidest thing ever it askes me a million and one questions about all this stupid stuff that doesn't even matter.  It was taking so long I was seriously about to walk out till I remembered how poor I am.  I need a job so bad...SO BAD. w/e I'm gonna go watch a movie, I'm done

      I'm wicked happy right now, yesterday I got Yellowcard Ocean Avenue and it is soooo good! I'm listening to it right now. It has really made my week, I love it so much. The best song on it I'd have to say is Only One, the sweetest song ever. Definately get this CD, it's wicked good. Way Away is also wicked good, its the first song. I'm kinda pissed off right now cuz I just got my schedule for my classes this year and I REALLY didn't want to think about school right now, I'm having the best summer. It isn't too bad cuz I'm only really taking 3 classes this year, I've got Anatomy Physiology, english, and history...Then I'm doing independent study advanced mathematics/some basic geometry/ some alg 2 that I didn't do b4. I'm also doing independent study psychology and French 4. So basically I'll be taking one French class a week and she'll give me work and I'll be reading French novels and crap like that, sounds fun (right).  I really hope there will be some cool new full time kids this year (preferably guys).  For those of you who don't know my school well theres not many people there, therefore theres not much selection with friends and guys if you know what I mean.  We've been lucky in the past but this year I don't know, people my age or close to it are diminishing and also all the seniors are graduated.  Now that I'm thoroughly depressed about school this year I'm gonna go clean.  PEACE OUT CHILLINS hahaha jk bye

      I MISS CAMP SO MUCH!!!  I had theee best time of my life, metin guys, havin fun, hangin out, singin, gettin closer to God, tons of stuff.  I met some truely awesome people, and there were some awesome ppl I didn't get to know and I really wish I did.  It is impossible to say right now everything I did last week, it would take forever but if you have the time and want to hear about it, im me.  I did tons of fun stuff and stepped out of my comfort zone a couple times which was SO worth it!  For those of you who didn't do the swing, you missed out, it was EXTREMELY scary but it was wicked worth it.  I'm seein some people from camp around Concord and Acton, which is awesome, it's helping me to not be too depressed.  I'm still deciding whether to go to the Concord yl or the Nashoba Valley one.  I'll see....
