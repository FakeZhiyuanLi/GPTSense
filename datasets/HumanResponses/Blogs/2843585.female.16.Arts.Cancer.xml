      So, I went out driving today. It was very fun. I drove around Clarksville, Triadelphia Ridge, then down 216 and home. It was fun. And I am happy to say that I, a 15 year old who has only had their permit for nigh on two months, went around a traffic circle properly. Beat that all you stupid 20-50 year olds who dont know how to drive. HAH. Anyways, I ended up getting this dude on my bumper who was totally going like 50 mph when the speed limit was 40. He ended up beeping at me and I was like, you suck. Right now I am going to go read some HP in preperation for the 3rd movie. Right now its seven of us going. I think Im taking Jessie and we are going to go hit the mall at 4:30.

      Dear Diary,    Wow...havent written that in ages. I wish it would rain...does that sound weird? It just seems that things are better when it rains. Downstairs, mum is having another attack. She's moaning and naucious and I just want to say 'fuck it all.' Why does this have to happen to her? I mean, she puts up with me, my brother and my dad all the time. Her life has just been one load of crap after the other and she doesnt deserve this. She's getting surgery on the 18th. Its a very risky-surgery and Im scared. She's never done too well under anasthethia and Im afraid something might happen. But that's just me isnt it? Stupid old Rebecca. Always over-exaggerating things. (And Ive been told this recently, too. I laughed, but it hurt.)   Feeling rather crappy right now. Tommorow I think Ill pop over to Columbia and go see The Day After Tommorow. Might call Fish Pond, might not. Its the mall on Monday. Hmmm...

       Haha. On Monday (which, as it turns out, was yesterday) Sara-wa, Tina-a, Ben and I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11. I, personally, thought it was very good. While the documentary was most definantly a Bush-basher, I found it funny. If your a Republican, you probably would not find it funny. I'll admit, some of the information was probably fabricated, but still... The movie had its ups and downs. Much of the beginning was boring but towards the middle was funny. (Ice cream truck scene, and Tappahanock) The latter middle was disturbing and I cried. Its the images you dont see on TV. The things I thought I could handle, but in the end, couldnt. The ending was funny. The movie just re-affirmed my desire to go into Peace Corps after college (would have done it after high school but parentals say they wont pay for college if i do that).   And, I have a car related post on my xanga that wont transfer here. I think its bloody hilarious but, then again, I use the word's bloody, prat, wotcher, and oi (and Im not British).

        You know what really hurts? More than someone saying that your fat and ugly, than finding out your friends have been going behind your back, more than finding out your boyfriend's cheating on you. Its when your mother goes into the hospital. Your dad returns home for a while. Then your mother calls and says she's lonely. And she asks for your DAD to come. When you ask if you can come, she says " No, I dont want you to see you." That really hurts. I guess I can say that she's drugged up, but still. It hurts.

        Im sitting in Journo now. Its our last class, thank god. Our final was 25 questions. 5 matching, 10 multiple choice and 10 true or false. Ah, life is good. We've just had a party and now I am bored. At least I will escape from this institution of 'learning' in 20 minutes. The time cannot pass to soon.    Tonight Im going to drive up to karate and see about karate kamp. Then Ill probably come home and rot again. Last night was bad. I cant say too much, just that it was bad. ive decided to write a short fic to enter next year. I think Ill take a leaf out of Emmanuel's book and do an 'impressions' visualization. Ill do my impressions of Paris (or Edinburgh) and London compared to the United States. I found out that Mary Lewis won a Cappie for The Wiz. Im so happy for her. She's such a nice person and she deserves it.   17 minutes now. This lap top is screwed up. Bleh. So...big news lately. We had the Music Department Awards Ceremony. Out of 4 awards given by O, I won two. I received a joint award (shared with Nimit, Marlon, Antonio and Brianne) for most improved. And I won the Unsung Hero award. Wowza.   Ive decided that i hate being shy. I see everybody else talking to people and here I am, once again being a loner. Its not that I am shy around my friends. No...around them I can get downright loud and cocky. But around other people...its like everything I say is weird and doesnt come out right. And when I dont speak, people get upset and think Im stuck up. NO PEOPLE. Its because I cant get the fucking right words to come out of my mouth. Its like my brain and mouth (vocal cords) are connected by are waging war against each other to see who can get out the most disjointed thing.    14 minutes. I think Ms. Zellner has spotted me on the lap top. Yup. She's definantly coming over here. Maybe if I kind of slide under the desk she wont notice. Maybe she wont care at all. Lets try it. E{OJod  Eeek, that kind ofdidnt work. Its dark here and Nicole's looking at me weird. Oh well. Tough shit.    13 minutes. My favorite number. Wish my birthday was on the 13th. But in reality its on the 2nd of July.  17 days until my birthday. Im not doing anything this year. Last year we delayed my birthday and went to Ram's Head. But that was right after the Big Fight. Right after Id needed my friends more than anything, and they were all gone. This year my dad is pressuring me to have a party but I mean, who wants to go to my house? Its a piece of shit compared to the COlumbians.    10 minutes and I have to go   FRIDAY NIGHT IM GOING NOWHERE AND EVERYTHIG IS CHANGING RED TO GREEN.

       Ugh. I took my bio final today. It was actually ok, considering that I didnt study for it. Sometimes I really amaze myself with my arcane knowledge. For example, just for the heck of it, Hughes decided to throw in this question about the human bladder and how much it could hold. I know I answered that one correctly! (And Ill leave the answer for you to decide.) It was funny, though, because during the middle of the test Kenny gets up and starts yelling "Ms. Hughes, save the fish!"   We all look over at the fish tank and see that the big black bottom feeder fish had stuck its head in the decorative aligators mouth. This would be ok, normally, except for the fact that the decorative aligator skull is electronic and makes a chomping motion. So, of course everyone was worried that the bottom feeder would get its head chomped off. It didnt. It sort of stayed there in the head for a little bit, twitching, and then it swam out and looked at the head for a second before bolting off to go try and eat the gold fish. (We think it has caniballistic tendencies)    While on this vein, what purpose does the decorative aligator head serve? Is it a turn on for the fish? Do they look at this chomping skull and think 'hey, Im going to go reproduce now." Maybe, as the number of fish in our tank has grown from 2 to 13. Scary. But then again, our class is obsessed with fish, I think. i mean, who can forget that fateful class about the whales (which was totally irrelevant as we were studying meiosis at the time.) Anyways, Zach Glenn gets up and goes "Ive heard that whales let out 2 gallons of sperm each time they mate. Where does it go? into the water?" Steve Pitts responds to this by looking Zach straight in the eyes and saying "Well, you know how the water's salty when you taste it..."  Then again, Pitts is also the same person who asked Ms. Hughes if Yeast had an official language of its own.    After the bio exam, I went to spanish where I learned even more things that i probably will never use, as we are going to france this winter. Then, after that was lunch where they served us cake. eating that stuff was probably not a good idea. After I had finished most of my piece, I started playing with the left over icing. Now Im not sure, but is it normal for two tablespoons of icing spread over a small plate to be able to hold up two metal forks and an empty juice container (this being upside down, mind you)?    We watched John Q. in Journo and it made me cry. Nicole told me that if I want an editor position next year its mine to have, and that made me very happy. Finally, away from all the freshies, and sophies of next year. BLISS! After that was math, where we played games and Brendan molested my drawing paper. I was deeply upset by the act which he did with my paper. I was deeply attached to it. I had finally perfected my signature for this year. But alas, it is now in the waste paper bin.    At 12:35 I was forced to go to the ACADEMIC'S assembly. Snore-fest. I dont need to hear about DECA. Everyone knows that DECA and Project Community are cults. I mean it. Last year I attended a Project Community meeting and everybody sat around talking to this tree. It was the scariest thing I have seen in my life.    So...on Saturday I went to Arie's house with Catharine.It was an accident, of course as Catharine got the day wrong for when we were supposed to go learn our skit. So, we trudged over to Arie's and saw Coco. She's so cute. And so big compared to last time I saw here. She ate cicadas. If that's not a Columbian dog for you, then what is. Afterwards I went to Ena-ta's party. We sang karaoke. First time singing Wicked I was Glinda and totally messed up because I cant sing really high with that type of music. Second time, (After Sara and I were alone in the room) I was Elphie and did a better job. Third time, we did both parts together, with choreagrahpy and we did good. I dont know, I thought I sounded like crap. Though at least I wasnt shaking when I sang with Sara the second and third times. The first time I thought I was going to fall over and DIE.     On to studying. Mum goes in on friday. Karate Kamp starts on Sunday. And Im screwed.  R.B.T.M.

       I have discovored that no one reads this blog, so I could post all sorts of nasty rants about them. Especially about Arie or Sara.  But I mean, come on, you cant really say anything mean about Arie or Sara because they are such nice people. Sara, I have never really ahd anything bad to say about. Never a negative comment. And then there's Arie who irks me sometimes on the fact that he likes to focus on certain groups of friends at times. So if your a member of the 'in' group of friends for him, life is good. But if he's focusing on another group, you hardly ever get a chance to talk to him. And then when you do, you feel guilty for interrupting his layout-ing or whatever he does.    Harry Potter is tommorow night, and I am excited. I know its not going to be as fab as the book 5 release, which was awesome, but hopefully it will be good. Gonna get me some Starbucks and some Uno's. Whereever that is. Lately Ive been feeling out of the loop. Distanced or something. But its just me. I just cant relate to the things people have been saying. Ive never had a really serious boyfriend. I mean, the closest I have come right now is my 8th grade one-step partner who thinks I am marvelous. God, that boy hasnt gotten out much. But I have decided that I will lower my standards for next homecoming if I dont get a date. I mean, half the school thinks I am a lesbian because I brought Catharine and Sara to homecoming. How embarassing. Not that I have anything against lesbians of course. I just like being straight.    I dont know, Im just weird and stuff. Ranting, I suppose. Teenage rant fest. The need to vent my insecurities to a non-emotional object which will not judge me. Bit like talking to your pillow or such. Miss America came to our school today. Talked about doing things now and not waiting til later. Basically, she was saying that if you didnt start your hobbies in like third grade, your never going to get very far with them. Made me feel like crap. I was like, hell, Im screwed.    Mr. O'Bryan didnt help much either. I mean, I know he's not exactly yelling at me, but he's yelling at my section, which I am a part of. I wish he would just bite the bullet and kick Marlon's little wanna-be white ass out. He cant play. Today at after school I was in the perfect position to hear all of the notes being played. Which is to say that the notes being played were not the ones which are on the page of music. Maybe some alien song they are transmitting? And i must say that I am in a position to judge. I have played the violin for 8 years now, and am one of the orchestra's strong players (as recognized once last year by Mr. O). Nicole is happy with my playing so I am happy. Because she is one hell of a good section leader as reversed to Geoffrey, the jesus-sandal wearing; headache getting; i have an online girlfriend who is probably a 50 year old man, Chandler.
