      all of sunday went by with G and me at loggerheads...by evening, we had broken up and made up a couple of times, i had stuffed myself with enough comfort food to feel a 100 kgs, and was generally nearing a complete depletion of my coping resources...basically i was a total washout, and i looked it. attending that mundan-bash was out..  so when we finally ended up at 10pm in the middle of a surreally well-lit park in the middle of posh gk2 market, puffing away at an ultramild and a goldflake respectively, i knew that one of my existential anxiety bouts was on the verge of erupting...i resignedly decided to give in and indulge rather than resist, like i usually do.  so there i went..........................................................why are we here? we arrive on this tiny speck of dirt called earth, study, work, fornicate, reproduce, hate, worry, love, fight, teach, achieve, learn, dream, and just when we get all puffed up about our own importance, we die. what is the point of all this? how different can you really make your life? it's all so ...ummm...boring! u know, what i mean?   for instance, why am i so singularly unecstatic about having fulfilled my life's dream of becoming a diplomat? after all, there are lakhs of people who would die (and kill) for what i've achieved...then why don't i feel that overwhelming sense of achievement that everybody assumes i should feel? every day i wake up trying to whip up some enthusiasm, reminding myself of all the times as a child that i had replied 'IFS' to the question of what i wanted to be in life (never IAS, mind you :-) ) but to no avail...   went home quite depressed...

       here's an interesting story to make you think about what should be more important to a doctor--keeping patient information confidential or doing his/her bit to safeguard public safety. (courtesy: the volokh conspiracy,  urlLink www.volokh.com )   A&nbsp; man who told doctors at a hospital that he drinks more than a six-pack of beer per day is now fighting to get his driver's license back because the physicians apparently reported him to the state. Keith Emerich, 44, said Tuesday he disclosed his drinking habit in February to doctors who were treating him for an irregular heartbeat. "I told them it was over a six-pack a day. . . ." . . .Emerich received a notice from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in April that his license was being recalled for medical reasons related to substance abuse. He has petitioned a judgeto restore the license, and a hearing has been set forJuly 29. A state law dating back to the 1960s requires doctors to report any physical or mental impairments inpatients that could compromise their ability to drive safely, PennDOT spokeswoman Joan Nissley said. . . . The law requires an indefinite recall of the license until the driver can prove that he is competent enoughto drive. . . .Aside from a drunken-driving conviction when he was 21, Emerich, a pressman at a local printshop who lives alone, said he has a clean driving record and doesn't drink and drive. . . ."They want me to go to counseling to prove that I'm OK," Emerich said. .   Precogs: A reader (of the volokh conspiracy) says that suspending a driver's license because the driver told his doctor that he drank over a six-pack of beer a day "[s]ounds like the movie 'Minority Report.'" "[B]ecause you like to have a few beers, even a few too many beers, you're considered guilty of driving drunk before the fact?"   Eugene Volokh says, "I'm not sure the state is right to suspend the license in that situation, but I think it's important to keep a sense of perspective here. What troubles most people about the "Minority Report"situation, in which people are prosecuted for murder because "precogs" (people with special powers of precognition) say that they're going to commit murder, is that someone is prosecuted because of what theywere supposedly going to do, not because of what they actually did. Even that isn't necessarily troubling: I think we're quite right to prosecute someone for attempting to commit a crime, even if they don't take the final step (which, if I recall correctly, is what happened in at least one of the incidents depicted in the movie). Sure, there's some uncertainty about whether the person was really going to go through with the crime. But if the police catch someone sitting at his window pointing a rifle at someone, with a finger on the trigger, and then an investigation shows that the person was almost certainly planning to kill theperson, I think prosecuting the person for attempted murder is just fine. Some amount of "precognition" is a normal part of the legal system. Likewise, say that someone goes to the doctor's office and says "I'm having these seizures every day or two; I just black out for a few seconds." It may be"precognition" that the person might well black out while driving, but it's a pretty sensible precognition. Similarly, if someone fails a driver's test, it's "precognition" that the person will likelybe a bad driver, but it's again a pretty sensible precognition. Nor is it "consider[ing the person]guilty of driving [recklessly] before the fact."No-one is being found guilty, or sent to jail. Rather, the person is being judged to be the sort of driver who ought not be given a license. If you think everyone should have a right to drive, at&nbsp;least until they commit a serious traffic offense, then you'd think that both of these people should beon the road until they're caught doing something dangerous. But if you think that driving on the public roads is something that should be licensed, and licenses should be given only to those who the licensing authorities think will be safe drivers (though with the authorities' discretion suitably cabined, so they can't just refuse licenses to people they don't like), then "precognition" is preciselyw hat you're endorsing: You're calling for a judgment, before the person kills someone or does something else that seems likely to kill someone, that the person is likely an unsafe driver. One could, of course, argue that having over asix-pack a day (as opposed to having daily seizures) might not make the person that dangerous a driver. Among other things, if a 175-lb. man drinks a beer every two hours, for a total of 9 hours in a 16-hourstretch, he will generally not be anywhere near drunk enough to be over the legal limit at any time during that stretch. Likewise, if he only drinks at home after work, and doesn't drive until he gets up in themorning, he may likewise be OK (though if he drinks enough right before bed, he might wake up drunk). So it's hard to tell how dangerous he will be.But the principle of driver's licensing -- which is definitely not the principle of criminal punishments, quite a different matter from licensing schemes-- is precisely that the licensing authorities should exercise some "precognition" (albeit guided and notentirely discretionary) about who is likely to be asafe enough driver and who isn't. Maybe we should change principles, or maybe the principle should cut in favor of allowing the person to keep his license here. But analogizing to "Minority Report"'s use of precognition for criminal punishment is quite a stretch; and the analogy is just as apt when a license is denied when the person fails a test, or is found tobe prone to frequent seizures.  this is what MJ Neela had to say about it:  "Patient information should be confidential. To stretch the logic of precognition a little more, the doc could be showing early signs of a psychopathic whistleblower. Should be denied confidential information as aprecaution??? That would be the end of his medical career. Huh!"

       you know, i'm sick of people going around glorifying everyday events and activities as being something very than they actually are...    &nbsp;  every kind of talent is a type of "intelligence"&nbsp;so we&nbsp;have&nbsp;kinesthetic intelligence, social intelligence, emotional intelligence, even, god help us, culinary intelligence! &nbsp;why can't they simply say culinary talent? or emotional sensitivity? or social etiquette? or kinesthetic skill? why does everything have to be "intelligence"? far from trying to dissociate from the snobbish purely-cerebral nose-in-the-air connotation of the word "intelligence", this amounts to&nbsp;the desperate bid&nbsp;of "intelligence" wannabes, who want&nbsp;soooo badly to be acknowledged by the cranial types to be recognised as one of them... we&nbsp;can't &nbsp;count beyond 2+2, but hey! we can dance like a ballerina on coke...so that make us intelliegent, right?!    &nbsp;  another typical one is "architect"...now nobody is the designer, conceiver or planner of anything... they are all architects... so you have the "architect" of a&nbsp;peace processes, welfare programs, manifestoes, or even a...
