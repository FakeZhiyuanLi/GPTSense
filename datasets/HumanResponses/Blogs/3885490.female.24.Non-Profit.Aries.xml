      i just had met the most arrogant security guard ever.. anyway i really do not want to tell that story anymore... because i have noticed i have told that story so many times it just makes me scream... but anyway with I will file a complaint and send the email to Kints... he will have to make sure that the guard will be out of the job in no time... as soon as I get to work later.. I'll fix up the email... anyway, It is just another weekend for me... Day after day.. i go through each day... one day at a time... I miss Louie... She is with her Dad as of the moment.. and I miss playing with her... One more work week for me... hopefully i'll get through.. ALIVE!!! im missing him again! (and i am so not watching "A walk to remember" in HBO!!! cause i so know that i am gonna miss him terribly if I do that... brings back all the memories) It is gonna be almost a year now... actually it is exactly the same day that I sent him the email for our 15th monthsary... our first (and last?) monthsary since he went to the States... God please let me be over him.. Cause i know he is... I am surely proud that he is doing good now... I never thought about the things that I did for him.. all i can think about is that I wish it made him happy... that i for once made him happy... but that is life for me... good thing I have these recognitions on my job to keep me busy... and of course try to work harder... but i definitely miss the letters, the flowers, phone calls, the chats, the hugging, and the smiles...

       I was not able to update my journal for days... only because i was stupid i forgot the url... hehehe stupid me! anyway thanks to aprille for reminding me that it was blospot not blogster... stupid friendster!   i just got from BOHOL for a paid working vacation...&nbsp;kudos to etelecare for treating us... the beach was sooo awesome.. white powdery sand... too bad i was not able to enjoy the sun because my dermatologist prohibited me to... but still i was not able to resist the volleyball temptation.. i played for a while... Beach Volleyball is soooo hard... but i enjoyed it...   Got the best compliment of my life... the VP of Operations just praised me in front of all the managers of the company... he said i builded consensus which was one of the qualities of being a recognized and achieved leader... WOW!!! Even Kints Kintanar was able to notice the compliment that he gave… Kints was nice enough to praise me in front of my mom... he told my mom that I was really good…He even said that it if it was him whom Benedict complemented in front of the whole group.. he wont be able to sleep for days... TRUE!!!   I really had a blast at BOHOL.. everybody was nice... even the people I havent met yet were nice... and also all those whom look like "suplados" and "supladas" were all so friendly... even Jeanine Nevada, who had an unfortunate experience with some stinky French people on the plane, was nice... we were exchanging jokes on how the air freshener on the wash room was much more pleasant than the French couple... &nbsp;  uhmm.. But still I wondered about my wish... I was actually shocked that i wished for him to be back... stupid me...

      just got this site from my dearest friend, aprille (who is madly in love with her new bf hooray girl u deserve it!) so glad she did... i was looking for an online journal for months now...   well, it will be just another day for me... trying to live my life without the one that i love... or hopefully loved.... i know my life is gonna change in time... hopefully these coming months... though some signs are coming that i really am on the verge of being completely over him... i still get this small pinch in my heart when he texts me.... god im so pathetic... almost a year has passed since we broke up... still im here going gaga over this guy who does not even appreciate the love that i offer.. damn... i would sometimes ask god how come i was given a love so true when i know it can never be returned... o well, life goes on for me... with or without ramon... we still have to remain as friends... we still have to talk when he comes home... hopefully by that time i can just grin and say... i did love him...

      We talked and chat... and i couldn't say that my dream made me cry... My dream of seeing him kissing another woman right before my very eyes... tore me apart... I just could not imagine how it would feel like if it was not a dream... if it was for real... I know that I will be shattered...  When he said " may kanya kanya na tayong buhay nila uriel at monthie,"   and that it made him sad... I was dying to say... "yeah even us, and that makes me miserable...and that i miss him so much." but i could not... I just did not want to spoil his happiness... because i want him to move on... and live his life...

      I guess I was both lucky and unlucky this week.. First they changed my days off at work... from thursday friday (which really sucked) to saturday sunday... Horray! I got 4 days off.. which ran out without even me knowing it...  I really wanted to buy that black jacket at Detour...Urgh! I am so gonna go back to buy that!  Anyway I had a good time with Louie last night.. we went to mass and ate afterwards... You can say that I really missed her so much... But she was sick though... so weren't able to spend that longer time bec she had to go home early to get rest...  Another thing, I got to chat with  him again... both last night and just today... I can say that it was descent... unlike the previous ones Ü... it was all good... I miss him but I know as the song goes... "Deep down you know it's best for yourself but youHate the thought of her being with someone else. But you know that it's over. We know that it's through. Let it burn. Gotta let it burn."

      Truly I know that you appreciate a gift more when you dont ask for it... that's why I know God has not given me him yet. Cause he knows that I am not ready yet...  I was not able to fulfill my promise I had a glimpse of my most dreadful movie... I could not resist.... It has been almost 2 weeks now... I haven't talked to him... then I would ask myself... "How come the pain wont go away?"  If only I could turn back time... and just for one day I could feel him... I know that will not happen again.. and that if it will, it would only make the wound go deeper... because I know he can never be true...  I had a dream of his mom... and in that dream.. she was not able to recognize me... and she kept on telling me about how they got back together... I wept... both in my dreams and reality... Because deep in my heart I knew that it was her whom she really loved not me...  "To the woman whom i've always loved," that is what he wrote... and up till now it still rings in my ear... I know it was not me... and that it has always been her... all along...
