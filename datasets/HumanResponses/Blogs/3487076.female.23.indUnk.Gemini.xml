						   you know when youve hit that point of no return, the stress is at a max. the only thing that could possibly relieve it is drawing all over your face with hooker red lipstick then skipping through the streets with your hair in pigtails, singing mairseydotes all the while snapping the straps on your yellow polkadot bikini and making kissey faces at the men? well, thankfully i havent reached that point yet. although when it happens i would definitely choose a 1 piece over a bikini.   i cant wait to get back to the gym (wednesday) and get some of this pent up energy out. its been much too long! i dedicated my morning planning my escape to Vancouver... well not so much escape as 'immigration' really. ok i dont have anything to worry about its the manpiece that must do the immigration thing. i guess its pointless to even worry about it right now, first things first. paying off the business credit. no probs. if we had a contract lined up that is! but at the moment we dont. M. is not worried in any way about this little fact, i on the other hand, am like a lemming desperately searching for a cliff.   ahhhh sunday, sweet relaxed sunday.  clean sheet day! how exciting! THIS is the highpoint of my week. crawling between fresh sheets every sunday evening.  yum. oh, its subway day too!!  yes, we are a schedule type people. monday=shellfishday tuesday=chickenday wednesday=pizzaday thursday=fishday friday=beefday saturday=fendforyourselfday sundy=subwayday   the same goes for cleaning! what can i say, i like a regimented ship when it comes to home stuff. everything else is fly by the seat of my pants example?   well sure, monday is shellfish day BUT OH BUT OH what kind will it be???? oysters? crab? mussles? lobster? prawns? langostines? clams? the list goes on!! and then what about the BAZILLION recipe ideas floating around in my brain to put to good use?!?! yes, definitely spontaneous my friend.   the new airconditioners work beautifully i might add. one problem being i get a headache every time they are on, im not sure if its coincidence or not but we will see how things get on with time. B im here!  you need to attack E in a dark work hallway and show him how much you want him, trust me it works everytime! whatever you do dont just sit there dreaming about it! life is way to short for that! go go go attackattackattack. be ruthless.  and on that note, i leave you with a thought.  what would the world be like without icecream?  not as cheery, Cat doth think.

						   hey! im Catesa but you can call me Cat, everyone does (unless its family, then its something else that doesnt need mentioning)  im married so i quite often blab about my man. i also have cats which means - as any cat lover knows - they are talked about quite a bit.   other things i talk about? whats going on in my day.. and really anything else that strikes me at the moment or has happened which requires reporting to the world, such as a 100g loss in body weight. because, every gram is a reason for celebration. chapmagne & lobster on me! heh.   so! im Canadian. yes, Canadian & proud of it (why shouldnt i be? it IS the best country in the world after all)  ive lived in the Netherlands for 3 years with the hubster Marcel (or M.) who is a Dutch 'cheesehead' as Germans so affectionatly name them, those wurstenwasser (sausage waters)  its a lovely relationship these countries have with eachother! really!  the Hubster (M.) is a computer nerd, something i love (and seem to easily attract) He does his business thing - Elysium Open Systems - and his dream is to become wellknown in the Unix community.  i have confidence he will achieve his dream someday.  my kitties.  Jazz a.k.a Jazzamuff, Jazzmatazz & Mr.fluffybutt -- thats sexy Mulder to you B.-- who we rescued from Petcetera in Victoria and Tigger a.k.a Tiggs,Tiggseypoopoo & Tinkerbelljinglekitty who we rescued from a little flea infested, hard to find shelter here in NL.  next on my list is 2-3 ragamuffins. purebred.  and eventually start a cattery. also, i love dogs more than anything. all dogs! all! but i have a special place in my heart for newfies, goldens, german shepards & great danes.  i will start a kennel of blue danes 1 day.  so something about myself perhaps?   im almost 23, 1.70m, 32.5kg over the weight i would consider ideal (which doesnt seem to bother me or anyone else all that much) and a very happy woman! i have very long dark reddish brown hair, gray eyes, very pale lightly freckled skin & i have a neverending eyebrow obsession. -- more so on other people than myself. if they are drawn on be prepared because i will go slack jawed, start drooling excessively and just point at your eyebrows for hours. or until you run away screaming in fear. i love to read, i read a lot. if someone recommends a book that catches my eye i MUST buy it. currently that was 'the big girls guide to life'  and its actually quite funny! at the moment im reading 'the lunatic cafe' (this is the 'outloud' book -- M. and i read together in the evenings, the anita blake series is what we are working through) and im reading 'the fat girls guide to life'  cause there was a deal, buy both books and save a couple bucks. and im all for saving a couple bucks. i love movies. all movies. saturday night is movie night, TONIGHT is movie night. we've got GO & Children of the corn 1,2 & 3  so lots of choice. anything else? nothing that i can really think of... i love going to the gym, cooking, shopping online, fresh bed sheets, the sea (and seafood), the colours of fall & spring/early summer, artsy things --clay,sketching,painting - anything really.  anything that involves learning instruments. i want to learn Piano, Violin, Harp & maybe the flute. i have friends all over the world & i will visit every single one when ive made my first million and can afford to fly first class -- or business even (its ok to settle sometimes). SWISH - self explanatory (i love rainbows, dont you?) mmm what else!?  i dont do politics but if i HAD to choose it would be liberal democrats or the equivalent of that.  i dont do religion but i like learning about all the different beliefs, my opinion on this used to be very different - ive grown up. im pretty much an open book & will talk about anything. from sex to drugs to that cat'o'ninetails you want to borrow from my PVC/leather collection. heh  ive got a huge family, most of which i love dearly. i hope know about my freespiritedness & openness before finding this page and being shocked into the grave. cause frankly my dear, that would just suck. bighairy..go..a  nevermind. heh.  anyway, im working on the photo thing but the potosharing program i downloaded is not compatible with a firewall DAMMIT so i need to find a new one. all in good time people. all in good time.

						   Hey B hows it going in the pink?? got me some space here ;)  i have another blog somewhere else but thats all about weightloss and therefor not the most exciting thing in the world, maybe it would be if i were actually losing weight but theres more to life my friend. indeed there is and thats why ive come here!  airconditiong for example! something most people take for granted but honestly? if it shut off one night while you were sleeping comfortably amongst 40 degree (celsius of course) weather, you wouldnt really be laughing now would you? no, i didnt think so.  also, having sex without airco in 40 degree weather? it isnt happening...   your toes for another. when was the last time you stroked your toes and lovingly told them how much they were appreciated? you know you wouldnt be standing very well let alone walking without them? yeah, its odd when you think about it but these small things we take for granted every day are actually quite necessary, believe it or not.  ok, thats enough rambling for one moment, im going to help M. pull another airconditioner up from the ground floor... exercise, who says i dont do any PFLLLTTT

						   The  littermaid litterbox arrived today and its wonderful! so far so good, no complaints. except one teency thing.   the littermaid people could find a way to make a solid click on kind of top with a solid swinging type door next to the tent with flaps as a second option.   the tent is ideal for a playtime or secret kitty sleeping place and even for cats who really just need pirvacy around their litterbox. NOT for cats who dig and digdigdigdig flinging litter everywhere then jump out and decide to lay on top of the tent to clean themselves.  especially cats over 10lb. its a sturdy tent i'll definitely say that much LOL  Jazz has used the new box enthousiastically many times.  Tigger is a little different as hes scared of anything new... hes entered, keeping one back paw on the litter catcher ramp thing JUST IN CASE. of what, im not quite sure.   after a few minutes finally bringing his last foot in. slowly circling the box, sniffing.  2... 3... 4 times.  digging a little then sloooooooowly exiting the box. only to have Jazz bound in DIGDIGDIIIIIIIIIIIG. i swear if they keep doing this the thing will never have time to rake through!  im sure the novelty of something new will wear off soon enough -- i hope. those crazy creatures.  tonight -- SUSHI yum. Marcel looked at the platter and asked if it was going to be filling... mmmmm probably not but itll be worth every bite! a good dinner yumyum. so, other than lots of laundry and setting up of the litterbox theres not much going on around here.  im not sure of my weight im getting readings so different day by day sometimes a whole kilo in difference im thinking its just pointless to weigh everyday anyway, although its kind of a habit... last i checked waaaaaaas 103.6 i think. around there anyway. when the day before that it was 102.3  wow. quite a difference.  oh~ i did have some black forrest cake, it was tasty too!  and ive been stress eating quite a bit, what with the whole nonexsistant client thing. we will end up borrowing some money soon just to pay off monthly taxes which adds to the stress.   mostly things are good but times like these everything goes to hell... my skin has broken out so badly, i look like a prepubescent teen. ive caught myself a few times tugging at my eyelashes/brows -- i do have trichotillomania which seems to flare up during times of extreme stress, i counteract it by mindlessly munching on crackers which really doesnt help the weight matter all that much either but at least ill have all my hair :-P  k im going to read now... just talking about stress stresses me out!

						   happy birthday baby! how does it feel to be 23?  not much different hey :)  well have a great day!! let me know how the party goes! and i want to know all the fun pressies you get!  on another note my house is a mess and my halfass attempts in changing that seem to cause more problem than not.  well, eventually things will change!  its quite warm here today, dont think ive stopped sweating more than 5 minutes... im smelly sweaty housewoman hear me ROAAAR lol  anyway, im back on the pill but the headache seems never ceasing. odd indeed, i suppose that rules out my hormone theory. i said i would go to the doctor tomorrow if its not gone but i probably wont so lets just forget i ever said that mmkay? k.  movie night was fun as usual, we saw mystic river!  slow in parts but overal a good movie. i wont buy it though.  and stuck on you... funny & cute but also not one to be bought. i suppose if theres some sale and they are both really cheap i would buy them :)  i did put in an order for a few dvds alongside M.s Linux certification in a nutshell book.  the birdcage, 10 things i hate about you, biodome, soninlaw, and i think 1 other movie that doesnt require much though but is purely for entertainment reasons.  they were cheap too, around 6 pounds each (i get my movies from amamzon.co.uk) ... dont you love sales? :D  k im going to put some socks on now.

						   morning *cough*  afternoon i suppose, it being 13:55 and all... wow where does the time go!?  anyway ive just been laying around nursing some nasty cramps wondering if M. is somewhere, dead.   hes not, im just a little dramatic. hes actually helping his big brother pave his parents driveway. repave.  for the 4th time in 30 years. is that really necessary?  their drive looked fine to me anyway and we were just there last weekend for fathers day.  fatherinlaw loved the movie we got him too which is always a bonus.   SUSHI  Emma, dont be scared luv its actually quite tasty! if its the raw seafood bit that makes you -heebyjeebery- would be the right word??  you could start with the vegetarian pieces like veggie maki & mini maki...  the california rolls are usually veggie although not authentic.  its just a seaweed wrap with things like avocado... very interesting indeed but the maki are great to start.    nigiri is ok, i just have to be in the right mood... sashimi is alright but it needs to look pretty and have lots of pickled/candied ginger with it mmmmm im quite picky.  ok, quite is an understatement im reallyreally REALLY picky.  although i prefer particular. i know exactly what i want and theres nothing wrong with that!  speaking of sushi we ordered a platter which will be delivered seafresh on monday i guess... perhaps tuesday, we will see whenever they call.  it was ordered today so it shouldnt be later than tuesday! yay for sushiiiii  tonight is movie night! im looking forward to laying around some more curled around a hot water bottle, sipping tea and munching on something chocolate...  ooo some red wine would be spectacular, really ease those pains. movies... last week it was aliens (the week before that it was alien -- aliens is definitely better -- LOVE suspense) and the last samurai. surprisingly good! im not a huge tom cruise fan but i liked him in it. other movies i liked him in... mission impossible (both)  i would like to see that vanilla sky movie eventually.  so tonight itll be a rental because a- cheaper than buying b- theres nothing in the shop we want to buy and c- its too late to put in an order.   Tigger & Jazz are getting quite excited about the prospect of their new litterbox, which will be sent out on monday! im very curious to see what it will be like... and if they wont be too freaked out.  the woman who sold it to me said it doesnt start until 10mins after they are out of the litterbox so that should be enough time for them to be out of the way...  oh, ive got to make a grocery list! need some more hairball paste (for the kitties, it doesnt taste all that good for me to take it daily) and a bunch of other things as well. time to find out how much longer M. will be over helping his brother...  sometimes i feel like such a married nag :-P  have a fab weekend all!  im down 1.2kg so i know i will, despite the cramps &  everlasting headache ;)

						   my pedicurist quit :(  she has some sort of allergy problem with the gloves she uses and just got out of the hospital it got so bad... her hands all broken open and infected. poor woman, i'll miss her she was a great pedicurist.   so, the search continues.  i pulled out my art supplies last night, time to get back into that... i do want something more in my life and since Vancouver is a long way off i must fill the need in different ways.  not a problem really.  been working on a wonderful puzzle as well! great puzzle, tons of detail. M. loves to help so its been going along quickly. i was planning on going to the gym today but this headache is neverending. this is day 3... day 4?  ive actually never had a headache last so long. the past few days ive consumed many too many painkillers. hte limit is 3 in 24hr but ive at least doubled it and to no avail. so yesterday i didnt take any all day long, except right before bed and still woke periodically through the night with a throbbing brain.. the painkillers just arent working anymore. so today im going for drinking 4litres of water in an attempt to drown it. also tension tamer tea seems to help, i'll get some of that...   on tuesday i went to the gym with a headache, just popped a few painkillers and worked through it, now the aleve just isnt working anymore :-$ this happened before with advil. i would take 5 at once and my headache still wouldnt go away.  anyway enough about headaches! some things i will do when i get back to Van in random order....  1. art classes 2. culinary classes 3. join a gym within walking distance that has a spa in it :) 4. begin my cattery 5. learn to rollerblade 6. find a good sushi restaurant and become friends with the owners 7. get a job 8. get a drivers licence 9. piano lessons/other instruments -- i want to try a lot.  yeah, thats what i want to do.. possibly more but of course i need to do the important stuff first, visit family/friends, find a house, help M. with a job hunt etc.  all those important things :)  im so excited about going home reallyreally. anyway, im off to dirnk some more water & hope this headache ceases soon!

YUM i lurrrrrve tuna casserole. the tuna, the rice, the mushroom soup, the the the oh just everything about it.  i just got back from the gym and had a great 45min cardio workout, im actually looking forward to thursday afternoon! tomorrow i have my pedicure which im really looking forward too, its been a while. well, last time i went she almost amputated my toe but i will thank her profusely for doing it as the unspeakable pain actually made everything better. i love her. i want to marry her and have her touch my feet everyday! also, im making tiger prawn linguine (tomorrow night) M. has been bugging me for a while to make it so why not?  im so glad this funk is over... thanks so much Indy, if you are reading. somewhere outthere :) i really do have wonderful friends. they may be few and far between but they are real & incredible & deliciously lovely teehee anyway! i really must get on with the tuna casserole... tuna casserole & mixed greens salad.   no more iceberg, that lettuce makes me want to vomit, just the smell of it *shudder*  from now on its rucola & a lot of other salads i cant translate into English... just dark leafy greens. yum. crispy juicy goodness. so, on with it!  kisses

						   gah im not feeling too hot right now *ugh* slept too much, cant get rid of this headache. same old stuff all the time it seems... started a puzzle ive had for a while today, its fun & keeps me occupied. Will is still sick poor baby. one day he'll decide hes ready to go to the gym... hopefully its soon id like some company! going alone isnt too bad but having someone to sit in the lounge with after working out and just talking, having drinks would be nice too. anyway i have to go make a grocery list now & make dinner.  tuna casserole perhaps?!  ive got to get in order already... enough bs. time to get real & do what needs to be done!!

						   so, 2 days later and what has changed? well 300g down which is a good start... exercise must become a habit again but not the way i was doing before, 1 hr in the morning and 1hr in teh evening. 1 hr total  should be enough no use in killing myself since it wasnt working at that time anyway, just resorting in a whole lotta frustration. im in a serious emotional dip right now and i suspect it has more to do with my period coming on friday/saturday than anything else but i really hate using that as an excuse. a while of journalling (on paper) and still nothing has come up that could be the cause.  indirectly im sure weight has something to do with it but i think its impatience. wanting to leave NOW and be in Van NOW and not being realistic about the whole situation which is something i will deal with on my own, find an outlet of sorts.    today is fathers day! HAPPY FATHERS DAY DAD :)  so my electric litterbox should be here soon! yay! i always look forward to and get excited about these little things... an electric litterbox! yay! how fabulous is that?! VERY. i can tell Jazz & Tigger are excited too, the way they.. well.. look excited and all that heh. crazy animals.  WELL! i must go shower etc, go for an afternoon with the fatherinlaw -- we got him Master & Commander -- great flick, i hope he likes it too. also my kitchens a damn mess after the bread baking i havent gotten around to cleaning it, im such a lazy asshole LOL  anyway, i'll get everything done eventually im not worried ;)

						   damn i feel mighty gross today. no joke. yuck to the billionth degree.  nothing can save me now, think i gained 2.5kg and EW i just cant stand to be with myself anymore. back to the gym and i'll be eating rice & fruit day and night for the next 6 months LOL  i dont care anymore... liquid, rice & fruit, bites of protein. whatever it takes baby but i really feel gross so thats that and nothing will change my mind now. this woman is on a rampage and you dont want to get bumped with THESE hips, im telling you. so here a semi dieting sort of blog is born, ive got no one doing this with me so i must talk somewhere... i DO need support but i cant seem to get it they way i need it so i will support myself & just quit the fucking whining and get on with it. zero tolerance. ive just had enough and its time to get mad. i can stay happy with myself but the more comfortable i feel the longer its taking me to get where i want to be. so, time to get uncomfortable.   the bread i baked sucked too...  NASTY.  also, why is it so impossible to find a rental place that allows pets in Vancouver? something tells me this is not going to be in any way easy... but hell, has anything in my life ever been? lets get on with things now, chopchop.  oh and if anyone comes to me for support right now i will BITE YOUR GODDAM HEAD OFF  there. now leave me alone im going to bed now. :-P pppffflllttt

						   23.  weeeeeeeeeeeee ive got to mix up some bloody marys before it gets too late. i was planning on having one for breakfast but since i was up at 9 (not my idea... Marcel was all giddy about giving me his pressie) and not 12 like i planned so blueberry muffins were the better choice, obviously. but i'll still have my bloody marys ready to go a.s.a.p i got a lovely email from my aunt Wendy  "LIFE IS SHORT, DANCE NAKED AND SHAKE YOUR TOOSHIE"  i love her so much :-) also an ecard from my Dad, very sweet indeed.   a txt message at 12am from Will Truman who also sent a package, a cute stuffed giraffe and a card that reads:  "i know its not as cute as i am, but u can use it whenever the most wanted gay is not around :) i love you much, Will."  I love him too :-D  the stuffed giraffe sits atop the dvd rack in the living room looking out for everything. cute indeed.  and last but certainly not least,   1. it comes from a funny place 2. ive wanted it forever.  ok, its no secret that Links of London is my favourite jewelry store and ive wanted everything in it for ages like 2+years but i asked him if it was jewelry and he said no :-D  anyway, the  'comes from a funny place'  i had to think but it never came to me finally he explained. links of london.  L.O.L   LOL is the Dutch word for fun. HEHEHE  so now i get it. sure, slapping myself in the head a few times heh. but yes, its a beautiful bracelet... linksoflondon signature heart sterling silver bracelet. i LOVE it. LOVELOVELOVE its my favourite piece of jewelry along wiht my pearl earrrings :) YAY FOR BIRTHDAYS!   so, ive been doing laundry and watching M. clean (what a wonderful bday gift -- men, you want to spoil your woman on her b-day, clean the house) so far its been alright! a regular day. i'll be drinking my bloody marys, eating nuts & cake... then maybe watching a movie or reading later .. .unless i pass out first.  my inlaws are coming over this evening, no doubt bearing gifts of cash which i will deposit into the 'going to Canada' savings fund. well... maybe i'll spend a little on myself. a vaseful of Sunflowers (my favourite) and a manicure. yeah, that will be nice.  so! i ordered some clothes but nothings arrived yet. dammit. and i wanted to wear a new outfit today. oh well, when it does arrive i'll end up sending most of it back after trying it on adn prancing around in front of the mirror its fun!  anyway, im off to enjoy the day. its warm & windy... the second year in a row it hasnt rained on my bday. it was a trendy apparently.  from my 13th (which was accompanied by thunder & lightening)  on to last year it rained/stormed everyyear on my bday.  but last year sun. sweeeeeltering heat, drought, dust the whole 9 yards.  this year is pleasant! windy & sunny & refreshing.  letshope it stays this way ;-)  23. wow. who would have thought id make it this far with my sanity still intact. well, i suppose thats a relative, i think im still sane but surely others would question it.   now, i leave you with the words of 1 of my alltime favourite songs  mellow yellow by Donovan  I'm just mad about Saffron, Saffron's mad about me I'm a-just mad about Saffron, She's just mad about me. They call me mellow yellow Quite rightly They call me mellow yellow Quite rightly They call me mellow yellow. I'm just mad about Fourteen, A-Fourteen's mad about me I'm a-just a-mad about a-Fourteen, She's just mad about me. They call me mellow yellow They call me mellow yellow Quite rightly They call me mellow yellow. Born high forever to fly, Wind-a velocity nil. Born high forever to fly, If you want your cup I will fill. They call me mellow yellow Quite rightly They call me mellow yellow Quite rightly They call me mellow yellow. He's so mellow, mellow fellow Electrical banana Is gonna be a sudden craze. Electrical banana Is bound to be the very next phase. They call it mellow yellow Quite rightly They call me mellow yellow Quite rightly They call me mellow yellow. You, ah, Saffron, yeah, I'm just mad about her I'm a-just a-mad about a-Saffron, She's just mad about me. They call me mellow yellow Quite rightly They call me mellow yellow Quite rightly They call me mellow yellow. Oh so mellow, oh so mellow, oh so mellow  this is the best song ever! now everyone come to my house for bloodymarys & singing HEEE

						   here i sit, sorting the dvds into categories. well not at this moment obviously because i had the urge to stop and write something. anyway! new dvd racks, yes. they are lovely. IKEA has certainly changed when it comes to solid wood quality items, im quite pleased with the prices as well!  2 new dvd racks, 1 coffee table, 1 dining table & 4 chairs.  a few decorations & a breakfast nook and our home will be complete (more or less) and lovely to live in until we have the money saved to immigrate. wonderful! i will be sure to take pictures too of course.  does anybody (if anybody actually reads this hehe) know of those emails... well forwards really... that are lists of questions people ask eachother   1. what time did you start this 2. what is your full name as it appears on your birth certificate 3. favourite food 4. favourite drink etcetcetc.  the ones you send on to get ot know your friends better. ive been searching but cant seem to find anything on the internet so if anyone knows, please drop a comment with some info.  thanks a bunch.  someone in the vicinity is cleaning with something resembling lemon pledge. its a pleasant smell, reminds me of my gramas house. i miss her so much, grampa too!  my whole family really... its tough being so far away. 9 hour flight for 2 that costs more than most peoples monthly income (yearly or longer in some countries!) its sad, they should make acceptions for people needing to connect with home, give a tax refund or something. call it the 'we feel sorry for you tax rebate' heh.  anyway! theres still plenty to do around here... dishes,laundry, finish grouping the dvds, get rid of the old coffee table, cleaning things here & there. oh you get the idea... its a housewife's world ;)

						   is there anything scarier than a scaryscary ice storm with thunder & lightening and tropical like sheet rain ( fat splattery drops) and ice chunks the size of pingpong balls when you are all alone with no one big and strong to cuddle up too? well... yeah there probably are but its still pretty damn scary.  hold me *squeak*  M. is out doing some errands, my package arrived. yay! proper sunscreen for my delicate face, i can go outside again. also special deodorant for my delicate underarm skin. im just a big chubby ball of delicacy didnt you know.  hes also out ordering my special facecare products (week long delivery) its not really special, its just biotherm but they never seem to have everything i need at the same time. apparently they dont make acnopur anymore so i switched to biopur. well! enough about my beauty regime.  oh, and speaking of chubby... ive lost 700g of the 2.6kg i gained. which leaves 1.9 more to go before im back where i was. good.  and thats enough about that!  ok, back to the beauty regime (got me thinking)  i never understood people who take hours to get ready! including shower, makeup, getting dressed, hair (MAYBE 45min) skin & hair are my most time consuming true... want nice skin & hair? water water water.  exercise from time to time. eat lots of fruit and MOISTURISE (even with oily skin and acne skin, moisturising is vital)-- a spray on hair sunscreen i would recommend as well.  how long it takes me to get ready:   shower (shampoo,condition,wash,facial cleanse, dry off, wrap hair)=15mins tone/moisturize/sunscreen=5mins makeup (mascara/liner & lipgloss, pinch the cheeks) = 5mins comb hair = 5mins  (sometimes longer if i dont use conditioner -- k my hair is waistlength it takes a while to comb it GENTLY  heh) getting dressed= 5-10mins   total: 35-40min  not bad...    its so different from person to person -- some straighten everyday, wear lots of makeup, just depends i guess.  it IS fascinating, i like knowing peoples beauty regimes.  movie night!! movies:  Alien directors cut special edition (the re-released one from 2003) master & commander.  hope you guys have a good weekend :)

						   i miss you! it was good to hear your voice, even if it was only like 5 mins and the reception was really bad in the gym's basement LOL  we should talk more often!   wow, it was a short but good workout too. i had to stop after 30mins because it felt like my feet were falling asleep and something tells me thats just not a good thing. the pain in my lower back/tailbone hips etc is the same, nothing has changed but i decided its just not enough to keep me from exercising. its one thing to have a toe infection and not be able to put my shoes on but a little back pain isnt enough to keep me from exercising no matter how much i actually hate doing it and use any excuse i can to avoid it.  i made some FANTASTIC pancakes last night. truly devine, i would share the recipe and call it my own but i found it online and well im too much of an ass to want to share it with everyone. i want to keep it all to my self.... ohhhh okie then.  fluffy yummy pancakes.  1 1/2cups flour 2TBSP sugar 2tsp baking powder 1/2tsp baking soda 1/2tsp salt  *sift these ingreds together into a bowl  make a well then mix in  1 1/4cup milk    stir  whisk in  2eggs 2TBSP oil (sunflower was nice)  wisk.  lumps are ok.  heat pan, pour batter bit by bit.  flip when bubbles appear & lightly golden.   put on a plate in a warm oven or keep under a towel.  oh, i found you shouldnt keep the pan too hot, if the pancakes get too dark they take a funny taste to them.  the flavour between the first pancake & the last one was VERY different. i threw the last one out.   it makes 4-8 pancakes depending on how you like them.  yummy! i will never use a boxed mix EVER again. these were quick, easy & the fluffiest tastiest pancakes ive ever had!  so what else. im tired. im watching seven. im in my white satin bathrobe. Jazz is sitting beside me, M. is laying on the other couch with Tigger cuddled behind his knees. its raining but deathly humid. i need to buy some tops, will do that tomorrow in fact.   yaaaaaaaaaaawn nightynight

						   well half of the living room is painted! (2 walls. the last wall will be painted white -- the 4th wall is all window so no worries about that)  we chose a golden creamy colour that i can only think to describe as rich vanilla icecream. M. calls it desert sand which is actually quite an accurate description... i still think of vanilla icecream though, some of them are stark white with little black seeds in it (the real vanilla pods have blackish seeds) but some are like thick sweet yellow cream from whipped egg yolks... and thats what it reminds me of. funny, always food! i cant help it though. especially lately it seems.  something is very weird in the universe. yesterday i smeared maple syrup on a rice cake and giggled insanely as it dripped in thick gobs onto the kitchen floor when i took a bite.  enough said? well, something is definitely wrong. M. said he wants me to watch his eating... i asked 'sit and watch you eat?'  (teehee)  he said no no. serve him a plate and make sure theres nothing left for seconds. we are both feeling a bit round and dumpy these last few days, waddling around like ducks. or those weeble things. not minding our habits just grabbing the nearest tasty thing and chowing down.  i STILL havent been back to the gym! i reallyreally plan on going tomorrow...  i do get up at 7:30 with the intention of going (why else on mothernatures green earth would you get up at that crazy hour anyway?) but something always happens! physically -- not otherwise. this morning while going to grab my breakfast (a bowl of fruit'n'fibre with skim milk IF you must know) i felt a strange twinge in my lower back and across the width of my hips & down the (back of the)right side of my butt and thigh.   so as any normal human would do to test the limit of that interesting feeling of pain,  i put all my weight onto my right leg ... and... jumped. *whimper* electric shocks of pain tore through my back/hips/butt/thigh  and i felt like crying... my mum says sciatica but i thought that was for people who were 400-500lb and needed a crane to be lifted around, im quite active (and nowhere near 400lb) so what is up with that?! she mentioned going for regular sport massages to help alleviate the problems but this seems to come and go as it pleases. sometimes i sleep in a weird position and end up limping all the next day. hm.  ANYWAY. its back to cooking proper meals & watching portions,writing everything down.  who says i cant enjoy myself and still do those things?  somehow i view pleasure with being able to do whatever i want without being monitored but its quite clear than when i dont monitor, i get out of control then the outcome (weight gain) threatens to destroy my pleasure. and THAT is something im not willing to let happen. stupidhokeyfadcounterdiet? NEVER not in a hundred billion years (ever again)  plan a meal, cook it, then go for a walk? DEFINITELY. and if the thundershowers start later (as predicted, thank you weather man... a little relief from this 30+ degree heat will be fabulous) i just might go a-singinintherain. well, maybe dancing anyway.  ooo Jazz & Tiggs are loving the new setup we made for them -- M. put kitty doors into the screen doors so now they can go in and out (the front AND back balcony) whenever they want and i dont have to worry about flies,mosquitoes,bees etcetc.  the only time the doors are closed is when we have the airco on. -- otherwise they are open every single day of the year :D well, when its crazy sideways rain i close the living room balcony door but the masterbedroom balcony door is aaaaaalways open.  oops, M. just went off to the office centre without his phone & people are calling! i would answer it but i fear it may be inlaws. motherinlaw? evil. fatherinlaw? probably fishing & never uses the phone anyway. brotherinlaw? well, hes cool but it wasnt his phone number on the call display (that i know of)   im off to the shower, after grabbing an apple so toodles.  also, HEY CYD great to 'see' you here!  hope all is well with you :)

DAMMIT.  AND to top it all off he just took it to hide at his parents house because he knows i wont go there to look for it . hmph.  he thinks hes soooooo cute heh. 10more days to go though, so we will see what happens. remember, there MUST be sushi. and ... and.... and something else like cake maybe.

						   trying to guess what M. could possibly be getting me for my b-day is driving me nuts! usually i KNOW what hes getting me, this year? not a clue. well ok, i have a few clues.  1- its something ive wanted for a long time 2- it comes from a funny place  what is that about, it comes from a funny place?   did i talk about this yesterday? i must be losing my mind.  anyway, i was planning a trip to the gym this morning but since i wanted at least 2 hours of undisturbed sleep (trying to slowly introduce the kitties to sleeping in the bedroom too) i had to put off the gym.  i could always go now but honestly? im just not feeling it.  B when was the last time you went to the gym?  guess i should get my butt in gear though... i dont have a problem with maintaining my weight. im quite happy but when i see a gain, a 1.2kg gain no less, i get a little itchy and have to exercise and eat fruit for a few days LOL    yeahhhhhh i talk about the weight thing once in a while but i just stopped using my weightloss blog so i have to talk about it somewhere from time to time! hmmmm what shall i have for dinenr tonight? its movie night!  the movie lineup i have is kids, bully & thirteen.  so itll probably be kids tonight, bully next weekend then thirteen the weekend after that. wow, im such an exciting conversationalist today (insert eye roll here)  im just so freakin tired! i feel like a zombie. oooo i like zombie movies.  anyway, B get that monster post up in the pink im waiting as patiently as i possibly can without going extra crazy. i need something to read to keep my mind off the b-day thing. if it comes early he might give it to me but he also might hide it somewhere to give on teh 17th.   i need sushi.    FAME im gonna live forreeevaaaaa  and i leave you on this note. britney spears is fab. abfab.  YAY SATURDAY

						   i havent been stung by a bee since i was a child but that doesnt make the feeling any less pleasant or any less able to draw feelings of extreme hatred towards all things flying.  the bumblebee is dead now, choosing me as its victim. maybe he felt his life was over anyway? maybe it was bumblebee suicide because i surely did not tempt him to sting me. he just got swept up with my mail! well, either way hes dead and im still in pain. it happened exactly 24hours ago. what started as a tiny painful spot is now the size of my palm, red, itchy but painful to scratch. OW.  yes, i took a hairbrush to that bitch before stepping into the shower and crying from the pain. heh. i tried vinegar, baking soda vinegar paste, soap... oh what i wouldnt give for some good sloppy MUD right now. slap some wet mud on that baby.   i suppose the only thing prevennting me bursting into a dramatic heap of sobbing female, is the knowledge that my birthday present from Marcel is on its way. he wont give me any tip other than its something ive wanted for a long time.  well. thats a hundred billion things + shoes. i thought secret thoughts. oooo its a kitten! OOOO ITS A PUPPY.  but he just informed me not to get the mail.  so, its coming by mail. i made him promise its not a movie or a book.  as much as i LOVE those things, they arent what i consider apropriate birthday fare.  maybe its a piano! coming in the mail from Japan?  GAWD its driving me mad... he just laughs and says patience.   well, anyone who knows me knows that i dont have any of that. hmph.  evil man.  im practically bursting from curiosity. EEEEEEEEEE and unless he plans on giving it to me early, i have to wait 13 more days.  just as long as he plans on serving sushi for dinner, i wont mind waiting.  tonight, i demand ice cream to go with my episode of Charmed.  maybe a burger since its beef day. oh, great burgers are so easy to make.  Cats fave burger.  1.stick a few slices of bread into the food processor. make breadcrumbs 2.put breadcrumbs somewhere other than the food processor 3.mince a few onions & garlic cloves, then put them somewhere other than the f.p. 3.take a fab lean beautiful cut of excellent quality buttery steak. MINCE IT.  (in the f.p) 4. scrape the minced steak into a GLASS bowl -- not metal. glass. 5. crack an egg into the meat, add breadcrumbs, garlic, onion. mush together with clean hands -- remove your rings of course. 6. squirt a bit of ketchup or bbq sauce & honey in. (i like heinz bio-ketchup & honey)  squige it some more.  add extra breadcrumbs as necessary. 7. form into thick pretty patties. 8. grill in a dry, nonstick pan.  3-5 minutes on each side depending how rare you like yours.  MMMMMM  i love it with a crispy wohlewheat bun (i use 1 pattie on each side of a hamburger bun)  thick slices of cold fresh tomat, a teency smearing of mayo on one side, wholegrain spicey mustard on the other.  plenty of crisp lettuce & cucumbers. fab with some oven fries :D  so! have a Catburger someday. its worth the money :)

						   M. has been home now for almost a whole week  and its seriously throwing me off. i cant even get my day started until the afternoon it seems! starting with him waking me up between 9-10am. its just so weird, it feels like one long weekend and i hope it ends soon! it makes me feel lazy and i REALLY hate that but hes just completely thrown me off. so i can either wait until my body adjusts or hope that he finds a client soon! i hope he finds a client.  isnt diet coke the best ever? MMMM  so yesterday everything was cleared up, i instated a new rule. noone to go into our bedroom ever unless i invite them or leave the door open on purpose heh.  im just glad there wasnt sex stuff lying around cause, well. how do you look your newly single brotherinlaw in the eye after that? imagine what he thinks *blush*  sure, theres enough of me to go around but theres just something about the phrase keeping it in the family that seems wrong. very wrong. i would like a bunny. a small black bunny with little floppy ears to lay on my chest and sleep with his little twitchy whiskers while i gently stroke his head oooooooo  that would be very relaxing!  M. wont let me have a bunny :( our russian dwarf hamsters died about a year ago & im going through rodent withdrawal.  is a rabbit considered a rodent? mmmm this diet coke sure is tasty. well, on with the laundry!

						   here i sit, munching on a snack of wholegrain bread with creamcheese. mmmm i love fresh bread with crusty crust (it has sesame seeds on it too) so today was my first time exercising again in 3 weeks! i have to say, its going to take a little bit of time building up to my former cardio glory!  its almost baffling how quickly i fall out of shape! well, i managed 15mins of walk/jog  and needed almost 2 minutes for my heart to recover.  slowly but surely i'll be back again.  theres not much more to say on this day... im making lobster linguine for dinner in a couple hours & im sure it will be delicious. surrrre its supposed to be pizza day but since we had takeaway on shellfish day, today we have shellfish instead.   everything balanced! MUST be! oooo someone just buzzed at the front door!! i wonder whatever could it be, im expecting a few things mail bound :)  it couldnt be anything since its my brother in law, and im not quite sure what hes doing here but hes here and i hate it when people show up unannounced!!! i mean, i dont really care what they say if my house is less than stellar but hell, a little warning???  anyway, i should go get the dishwasher loaded before its time again to cook dinner!!! PFLT  look, see what happens? i go crazy with exclamation marks & question marks when im upset.  hmph. what pisses me off the most? when M. tredges people through our bedroom that PISSES ME OFF. i had clothes laying around! people dont need to know what kind of panties i wear & what bra i use to exercise in...  i hate it when he does that & he knows it. if he doesnt, he sure as hell will when he gets home. anyway, i would be a bit calmer if i could have something round and fuzzy but my peaches are hard. hehe that sounds nasty

						   is there anything more fun than getting new stuff? sure, there probably is but getting new stuff is still pretty fab. especially when that new stuff allows you to bake lots of yummy things like meatloaf, tuna casserole and perogies amongst other various and sundry things (that might just include chocolate OOOOOO) 4 new casserole/oven dishes. 2 oval, 2 rectangle (its the details that matter after all) and 2 loaf pans!  banana bread here i come!! YUMMM  oh, the rolling pin. i cannot stress the importance of this piece enough! after using drinking glasses to roll out the dough for the last couple years? (my cooking talent didnt surface until then) this purchase made me a giggly bouncy school girl again. and oh, how the men stared at my bouncy jiggly self. they practically drooled all over themselves. it makes me wonder about their partners breast size. or lack thereof whatever the case may be. who ever said an abundance of flesh was a bad thing?  not anyone who had men drooling over them thats for sure! heh. sometimes i think my husband grows fangs just as an excuse to bend over and take a big bite out of my thighs.  i love being me  ;)

						   well he only had that 1 day of hard labour.. then they realised he had a brain so they had him operating machinery, but last night was his LAST night indeed.  the regular floor manager came back. the permanent guy. and well, lets just say things didnt work out so well... Marcel quit at the end of his shift. i respect his decision completely, hes been through that situation before and its just not pretty...  so its back to the drawing board! the heat has hit an all time high today, the temp. reader in the living room no longer registers after 35 degrees :-$ its HOT dripping hot. i have both aircos going & all 3 ceiling fans and im STILL sweating! and im expected to exercise in this? HELL NO heh. well, i'll get back to exercising eventually... maybe if the room cools off a bit i'll do some situps and throw my handweights around, do some jumping jacks or marching in place.   speaking of getting healthy i woke up this morning heavvvvyyyyy (no doubt due to the pizza i ate at 23:00 last night)  im talking heavier than heavy... like gain 1.5kg over night!  ok getting to the point now (pointypointypointpointpoint) WW has worked so with ww i shall stay.  or rather, go back too! theres something fun called flex points?  not here, but im getting the jist of things & want to use it rather thaaan... oh what was it last time i did this...  points plus.  if that means anything to anyone. so, today i begin a sperate blog for those weighty things... oooo thats a good name! i'll use that! and PHEW my 3rd and final 'attempt' with WW.  although an attempt predicts failure & im just not about that anymore. its time to address my issues headon, not be so damned passive agressive &amp; whiney *hand me a fucking cookie* about them.  anyway, im going to start that now.  in other things, ive talked to my mum and shes THRILLED at the prospect of me coming home to stay & work while i save up for a future...  Marcel would stay here and do all the stuff that needs doing.  we are still working through that at the moment. deciding if whether or not we want to be apart for 2 years (or more) for the greater good of our future lives together. we will defintiely see what happens.  should i shave my pussy?  *cough*  cat.  teehee.  yes, im 12 so what?  Jazz is looking mighty miserable these days, what with his long thick black hair. last year i took some scissors to his coat and he looked so much happier in the hothothot weather! although last year it was hot like this from may-september.  this year its been from mid-july.  hopefully not the entire month of august but the way things are going there doesnt seem to be a break in sight anywhere. should i shave him?  maybe i'll leave all the fur on his tail, legs & head. hehe that would be funny indeed &amp; hes such a vain little creature too >:-)>~ i'll have an in depth conference with him and ask how he feels about that idea :) Tiggers all right, sprawled out on teh floor... he has an indented tummy. honestly! i can fit my hand around his middle ! my middle finger & thumb almost touch eachother thats how small he is.  yet  hes the one panting like a dog after running a few meters.  Jazz isnt a panter.  maybe hes too vain? Tigger certainly isnt attractive when hes panting like a dog. or a lion. whatever... do lions pant? also another thing that Tigger does that is like the wild cats is when he sniffs something (less than stellar?) he pulls up his lip and squints and sticks his tongue out a little.   i DO watch discovery channel and i notice Lions & Tigers do that when they sniff something like the markins of other animals or to catch the scent of a female in heat?  they have some gland in their mouths that processes these special smells and the only way to get the scent there is to make that funny face.   but why would a domestic feline do that?  does Tigger have true wild cat instincts still in him? he is the only one who hunts fly & wasps/bees.  he is the only one who does little spraying his territory motions (he doesnt actually spray though)   and hes the only one who does pounce & attack games.   maybe my baby is still a little wild yet ;)  Jazz likes to lay around, chase a ball once in a while & demand treats. hes the only one who has caught a bird, on the balcony,  without claws no less.  but that doesnt make him the wild one does it? nah.  Tiggs  is the true hunter GRAAAWWRR  i need a shower. its hot. did i mention that? yeah. boiling point.  oh! wasnt that a movie or something?  speaking of movies, tonight is movie night!  brokendown palace at 22:00  looking forward to that one ;-)

						   okie yesterday i mentioned he wouldnt be home till 19:00 when in actuality it was 22:00 yes, he did a full 8 hours of hard physical labour and came home absolutely BROKEN.  today, he must do it all over again.&nbsp;  you know its strange!&nbsp; in all the 7 years weve been together, this last 2 months of spending almost every moment together...&nbsp;&nbsp; waking up together, everything! its the longest period of unbroken time weve spent together.&nbsp; when i didnt see him for a full 8 hours yesterday i honestly truly missed him.&nbsp; when he walked through that door last night, broken or not i dont think ive been happier to see anyone in my whole life and thats NOT only because he was carrying pizza...&nbsp; really&nbsp;:)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *cough*  anyway, enough gushiness...&nbsp; i feel my depression lifting. slowly, very slowly but defintiely lifting!&nbsp; this in itself makes me smile...&nbsp;&nbsp; but it seems ive switched one problem with another equally annoying one. before i couldnt seem to get enough sleep, now i cant seem to&nbsp;sleep!&nbsp; F(*^H#@*#^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ok i DO sleep just in very short unsatisfying bursts.&nbsp; i dont fall asleep until about&nbsp;3:00 then i wake at 5:00... then i fall asleep again by 6 or 7:00 ... then im up by 9 or 10:00 &nbsp;:-$&nbsp;  oh well, this too will pass eventually!&nbsp; now M. is eating pizza and im reminded all i had for breakfast was a glass of cranberry juice & a bottle of water &amp; its almost 13:00 so im going to eat something now.   &nbsp;

						   since moving all the furniture around and purchasing new pieces ive had to put away my little shrine to my dragon lion hunting/fighting&nbsp;goddesses that looked over our home & our lives. (they are actually a pair of brightly coloured hand painted/carved lion statues with removable swords in their mouths &nbsp;that Marcel gave me as a gift when he came back from Taiwan -- the high point of our success to date it seems, ill take a photo some day) a couple days ago i got a weird feeling that since that happened everything weve done has not turned out tremendously. so last night i pulled out my goddesses and set them high ontop of the dvd racks to watch over us again. i asked them for help (ok im not a religious person, i just worship my dragon lion hunting/fighting goddesses --&nbsp; and nature :) )&nbsp; and today while Marcel was on his way to the store for a replacement ceiling fan (it broke a couple weeks ago)&nbsp; he called me that he wouldnt be home till 19:00 because he got a job :)&nbsp; and has a small one for the rest of the week...&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing huge but its a start!&nbsp;  is our luck turning? after he called me i said thank you to my goddesses and cried a little because maybe we wont lose our home after all...  im still working up the courage to apply for those sony positions.. after doing nothing for 4 years its tough to find that confidence again. hiding out, being a recluse, it doesnt do much for wanting to be with people does it? no, it sure doesnt.&nbsp; now add the language factor and although im fluent its not a comfortable fluency, im still a guest here, i dont belong.... know what i mean jellybean?  yeah, anyway... im working on it.  *sigh*&nbsp; i feel a glimmer of hope springing to life within my tired body.

						   so i guess the title sums that up that bit!&nbsp; i did slather myself in SPF 45 and went out to sit in the sun for about 5 mins. it was wonderful! i think im burnt though...&nbsp;&nbsp; *cough*   HEEE   ok so Emma posted in my comments that a problem shared is a problem halved which i do in every way agree with ... but... i always feel like a burden to people & am not used to asking for help or anything like that, i always feel like people are feeling sorry for me... pity party, that kind of thing. but i suppose if everyone (well whoever reads this) promises not to show pity then ok i will share.  promise???? OK then.  im going through a mad depression right now, its been going on for over 2 weeks now and i know its real because ive never felt anything like it before.&nbsp; i smile, i laugh, i joke when all i really want to do is crawl into bed and sleep for eternity, never wake up.&nbsp; i just dont want to be here anymore...&nbsp; its hard to write let alone talk about.&nbsp;  this isnt some passing PMS drama queen whiney please hug me kind of stuff... this is serious and it scares me. and why dont i talk about it?? because everyone will suggest going to get help and i dont want help. im pretty sure the only thing that triggered this all is my grampas 88th b-day then it just kept getting worse with the business situation & now last night finding out we could lose our home &amp; everything in it, our car... the list goes on. ive developed an incredible hatred for this country (more the gov't than anything else)&nbsp; and also just want to go to sleep and never wake up because i cant bear the thought of living without my grandparents and the reality that i might never see them again. amongst being so tired & lethargic all day, ive completely lost my sex drive which as most who know me is the most unimaginable thing in my world... not to mention i would rather eat dirt than have sex right now. ive completely lost my appetite,&nbsp; writing down what i eat while in reality i eat like 1 piece of bread or 1 pancake with an egg and some juice...&nbsp; all i feel like doing is drinking water all day, its so weird.&nbsp; almost as if something in my brain triggered this "if i dont eat, we save money = less chance of losing our home"&nbsp; i cant quite explain it but thats that. up to this point the only people who know the extent of all this&nbsp;is M.&nbsp; and my friend Brie. oh, and my sister who i just told on sunday....&nbsp; i wanted some advice from mum but she agreed with me when i said its better not to tell mum because she will just worry and i cant do that to her, shes got so much to worry about already.  so there you have it! the short and sweet version: i just dont want to be here & if it means dying then maybe it would be better that way.  see now why i didnt want to tell anyone? its completely uncharacteristic &amp; incredibly difficult to discuss... theres just nothing else to it. ive been looking for work and theres a possibility i'll end up working for Sony. we will see how that pans out. maybe a proper routine will help snap me out of it?  anyway, im going to enjoy my cranberry juice now.

						   its certainly cooled down considerably!&nbsp; very refreshing.&nbsp; weather report did say it would be back up by thursday though so i will enjoy every moment of this cool weather before that happens. nothings changed here, still trying to pull myself out... finally talked to my sister about it last night and she agrees it wouldnt be wise to tell mum just yet.&nbsp; i always feel so bad to know mum would be worrying, i dont want her to worry about me but i would like her advice at the same time. still nothing new on the business front, M.&nbsp; voiced his worry last night but i tried not to hear it because when he starts worrying it sends me into downward spirals.&nbsp; of course thats already happened. well, only time will tell. we can hope something turns up soon and that all will be well in the end. im still considering going away for a while but theres been no news on that yet, the place i emailed last week still hasnt gotten back to me so we will also just have to wait and see what happens with that. if push comes to shove i have enough saved for a plane ticket so i could go home & work a few jobs to save money while M. gets everything sorted here. the only problem with that would be we wouldnt see eachother for a couple years.&nbsp; we have done the long distance thing before the difference was we saw eachother every 6 months or so. this time around it wouldnt work that way. again, we will see what happens. seems to be my catch phrase lately ... can i roll my eyes now? :-P i lost another couple hundred grams, typical of my weight loss but i feel convinced my muscles are wasting away because i dont feel like doing anything.&nbsp; hopefully that passes soon as well. i suppose it will be like a chain reaction, once the job comes the attitudes will pick up a bit and i wont be sucking in his negative energy which is dragging me down. why cant i just shut off to the people around me. id probably be much happier :-P   anyway i dont have anything positive to say so i wont say anything else at all...&nbsp; i can deal with this on my own im sure.

						   nothing new on this end, probably why i havent updated in a couple days.&nbsp; its as hot as ever i guess the summer is here to stay whether i like it or not :)  i honestly dont have much to write about...&nbsp;&nbsp; since Jazz broke his litterbox tent frame M. has built a new one, made of metal so theres no chance that little bastard will be able to break it again.&nbsp;  lets see. my weight is the same... well minus a couple hundred grams, no worries. ive been considering a weightloss vacation type thing.&nbsp; getting away from here for a few months, getting out into the wilderness, doing the things i long to do without leaving M. permanently because if i went back to Canada thats exactly what would happen. we are getting teency clients here and there but nothing substantial that will put me at ease.&nbsp; we had 1 possibility today but havent heard back about it.&nbsp; oh, its in Amsterdam too which means for 1 year i would be in a hotel all week then home on the weekends. if that happens i wonder what will happen to my kitties.&nbsp; maybe i'll stay home every other week just to be alone for a while. yeah, stock up on frozen pizza & ... um... i mean... healthy chicken cutlets &amp; veggies. *cough*  yeah...&nbsp; that could definitely work.&nbsp; maybe i'll go steal someones bike too, ladies got to have some transportation when her chauffer leaves, after all. if i did go away to weightloss camp i would have to buy a pair of good hiking type shoes! theres plenty of trails & forest!! YAY! but other than that there are km's of beaches &amp; i can do that barefoot... except in november/december, i might have to keep running shoes on. it gets quite cold in that part of the world. im not giving much away yet, ive emailed to ask about extended stays since the longest cycle is 21days.&nbsp; i want to stay for 4 months & need to know about any money i can possibly save IF its a possibility. we will see what happens. i certainly need to do something and get out of here for a while.&nbsp; if it means i can lose weight doing it then SO BE IT. i certainly wont be complaining.  70-100lb to lose.&nbsp; 70 is doable in 4 months isnt it??&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah, 17.5lb per month?!&nbsp; thats about 4lb per week... it should be doable for the first few weeks anyway.&nbsp; id expect it to slow down quite a bit after that ...&nbsp; id lose 32lb minimum anyway, and still 32lb is quite a substantial amount! although honestly i would probably try to shave the 70 off if i could *blush* im all about drama like that. anyway, im supersweaty sitting here in the humidity so im going to drag myself through the shower & hop into the airconditioned bedroom to read a while. *Sigh* oh for the finer things in life. oh-- and yes, i would be willing to put my immigration on hold a few months if it means getting away and losing some weight on holiday. alone.&nbsp; veryyyyyy alone. yes. absolutely.

						   wow what a difference in weather! from&nbsp; grey windy cool wonderfulness to humid cant catch my breath choking heat.&nbsp;&nbsp; and this is why i hate summer. except when its cool out of course....  &nbsp;  so Jazz broke his litterbox tent cover the little dumbass runs and jumps on it &amp; it finally broke. what a waste of money.&nbsp; like i said they should change their design... M. has made some measurements and gone to the local DIY shop to pick up some metal bits, he will make a sturdy frame with support on the top so Jazz can jump on it as much as he wants, the tent will not break again!  &nbsp;  mmm saturday. movie night.&nbsp; forrest gump is on the agenda tonight! now that we are pissbroke we can only hope decent movies play on tv saturday nights... when all else fails we turn to our own movies, which isnt a horrible thing we do have a fun bunch of flicks to choose from if need be.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  whatelse is there?! well im still maintaining my weight... actually am a couple hundred grams down from last week but overal my biggest goal is to not gain anything else while M. is home.&nbsp; its unbelievable the effect of having him around 24/7 has on my emotions and my emotions have a play in my weight more than anything else. what can i say im a very emotional eater. not to mention a major couch potato. exercise bites ass.&nbsp; and i could deal with a replacement of that little thing in my brain that says im full...&nbsp; i think mines faulty.&nbsp; is there a warranty on these things? mine definitely needs replacing.&nbsp;&nbsp; last night i made a small pan of lasagna and it was DELISH a little homemade garlic toast on the side. -- i had 2 slices of toast &amp; a little less than half the pan of lasagna.&nbsp; ok, im talking a small pan though, i could fit about 6 lasagna leaves in it--2 of them cracked to fit in place.&nbsp; but still... saying i just ate almost half a pan of lasagna sounds pretty gluttonous no? :)&nbsp;&nbsp; it was less than a restaurant serving but still too big just the same. surely if id made a salad to go with it i would have eaten less... but lately the smell of lettuce makes me want to be sick. just THINKING about lettuce makes me gag. very dramatic but its true.&nbsp; it was only iceburg lettuce in the beginning (iceburg will always make me sick now) so i switched to leafy dark greens and now thinking about them is sickening.&nbsp;&nbsp; i think the only thing that isnt doing this to me is spinach leaves.&nbsp; so far.&nbsp; maybe i just need different salad dressings?  another very important reason to go back to Canada! the huge selection of salad dressings!! kraft, here i come!  &nbsp;  aaaanyway, ive started reading the poisonwoodbible again -- one of my favourite books. and i hear it calling my name from the coffee table, so thats that for today! have a fab weekend ;)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

						    very few things can wake me up when im feeling exhausted from stress but there are 2 things that always do it, never fails.  1-the smell of fresh cut grass before or after it rains 2-the smell of breakfast being made -- pancakes/bacon/toast and all those tasty things.  so since im the only one in this house who cooks you can guess what dragged my eyelids open this morning.  such a beautiful fresh smell! today im freezing my gym account until october, im just incredibly unmotivated to do any exercise and its becoming a waste of money and that is money we cannot afford to waste at this time.   M. did say that the UK businesses are over their holidays and pages upon pages of IT jobs are showing themselves... so EU IT jobs should be close to follow, sometime next week i hope! with quarterly taxes and all other payments to be made, we are going to be able to pay them as long as we dont buy groceries or anything else. next month? well...  lets just pretend next month will never come & i can keep my sanity intact.  i poked an earring through the 3rd piercing hole i had in my right ear.  its been closed for quite a while so you can imagine the drama that has ensued.  yes.  much drama indeed! well im using some disinfectant iodine type stuff to help out, hopefully i dont get infected. its just a bit swollen,red and hurts to touch i hope it goes away soon!  i tried to be a single piercing person again but its just not my personality so im not pretending to be someone else anymore :-P  hmmm what to talk about? well im reading 'the killing dance'  (the outloud book)  & 'hou je mond' at the moment...  i have enough reading material to last until more prosperous days too bad most of its in dutch, ive had enough of this language and cant wait to leave! ASAP!! i have just over 1,000 euros saved.  only 63,000 to go! yowza. i hope it doesnt take as long as it LOOKS like its going to take.  just that i can only afford to pay us about 150 euros a month during the really bad times -- its more when possible of course, but now its not.  anyway it just feels like 64,000 is a loooong way to go! of course we are only taking about 30,000 E of that to canada with us (rest is for payments to inlaws/business credit accounts etc) should be enough for a downpayment on something in Van  plus a bit to last us until we both find work. i dont want to spend more than 450,000 canadian on a house anyway so it should definitely be doable!   enough money talk! off to do housework!

						   all day yesterday my neck was in quite a bit of pain but it doesnt compare to how it felt this morning ... hooooooooooooooooooo  hurts to move i think i had a dream about being in a car accident and woke up with whiplash! ow.  anyway, it'll go away in a couple days it usually does. i'll just workout at home instead of going to the gym, just to stay on the safe side.  on to other things, im officially panicked. utter panic. no other words describe it! money is not the most important thing but when the tax service doesnt get their share things get ugly... jail is involved... its a big ol' mess so lets just leave it at that and let me breathe & think of happier things.  damn i need a holiday.  in fact theres  nothing else going through my mind worth talking about... it consumes my every thought. so i'll just go away now. far far far away from these problems.

						   my body is ok! really....    urp gurgle groink spronk urrrrg  this is what my body was saying to me last night as i gleefully munched on my dinner of homemade crunchy style tacos then had waffels & cream with fresh cherries for dessert. i am convinced it was a protest.  coincidentally enough Emma sms'ed me at that precies moment i had cleared the dished and sat down to watch Charmed and one word rang true DETOX  she is right & my body was demanding it after all that.  you know im almost convinced the lean ground beef i bought was regular beef with a lean beef sticker slapped on it, i drained A LOT of oil from that.... AWFUL stuff.  of course until our financial situation improves we have to subsitute the steak i would usually grind myself with the already ground stuff. ew.   these are the things we do to ensure the tax service gets paid first. damn them, money grubbing dickwads they should all burn in hades with laxatives being forced down their throats at hourly intervals until theres nothing left of them but dehydrated skin & bones.    i hope they come back in their next lives as the shovel & pitchfork thats used to clean out horses & cows yards.    anyway....  my detox plan for the day to chase nastiness away goes as follows.  breakfast: a small bowl of fresh strawberries, a granny smith appple & a glass of cranberry juice. soon to be followed by chugging 1/2 litre bottle of water.  snack: tea (caffeine free)  with honey &  chugging another 1/2litre bottle of water  lunch:  leafy greens salad with lemon juice/vinegar/herb/olive oil dressing, handful of cucumber slices.  chugging another 1/2litre bottle of water  snack: drink bouillon, banana & 1/2 litre bottle of water -- chugged.  dinner: begin with chugging 1/2 litre bottle of water then having something like a small plate of pasta with marinara sauce.  movie snack: airpopped popcorn (plain) and 1 can of caffeine free light coke. -- if still wanting more then have fresh cherries.   so thats my detox. i think its a pretty good one & i always feel better the day after :)

						   well not really but thats the song im listening too (spark) ... dont you just love Tori Amos?  i know i do. shes beeeee-utiful  so, its been a couple days. anything interesting happened? not really, we got a couple small jobs that wont really help in the long run but its certainly better than licking the dirty cement for sustenance which we are THISCLOSE in needing to do.  well, M. has his Linux. im so proud of him, can you see me glowing? yes indeed. hes built it and today he will have a chance to test it.  the first linux he configured went horribly wrong so he recompiled everything and today is test day. it shall be tested as a firewall as luck should have it our old one started hanging after incorporating some pearl so one file is very badly corrupt & basically shit the bed for lack of better terms.  YES i hope this goes well because if it does he can start selling it!! YAY!  im still waiting ... kind of like a hooker... for that big client to come along and solve all our financial problems it may be wishful thinking but hell if a girl cant dream what can she do?   yesterday i went to the ortho. for one of the last appointments the conversation went something like this -- roughly translated from the odd dutch language  w: and youve been wearing your retainer night and day for the past 3 months? me: *bats eyelashes innocently*  yes, of course.  w: are you sure? me: *wonders if something is giving me away*  ummm yes im pretty sure  at this point i feel the need to mention i have been wearing it only in the evenings.   w:  --- me: *cough*  umm on my birthday i didnt wear it all day. w: ----------- me: ---- me: *oh my face is getting red, he can tell im lying* me: -blurts out-  my husband and i had sex all day once and i didnt wear it at all for almost 48 hours w: raises eyebrows  me: ummm other than that i think i wore it 24/7  *smiles* w: *hmm*  ok, since everything looks perfectly normal anyway you only have to wear it all night & half the day, then in october switch to only nights.   i'll see you in january for another followup.  --  w. walks out.  me: *dammit why did i say that ... stupid brain, everything looked normal!*   anyway it was funny or maybe it was one of those you had to be there situations.  SO!   went to the gym yesterday... that was nice, only half hour but its better than nothing and i felt like i was actually getting something done. i hate feeling inactive despite the fact the couch is my best friend :-P  whatever, nothing compares to the orthodontist story now so i'll just stop while im ahead. im pretty sure he's single. cute (in a dr. Green from ER kind of way) has nice cars too.   1 of them is a black bmw z3 (used to be my favourite car)  dinner tonight: cat's burger, oven fries & salad with apple honey dressing.     10 things i love & wouldnt like living without  1. bottled water 2. reading material 3. air popper 4. music 5. special deodorant that i use 6. my bed 7. chanel #5 8. my internet connection (with computer of course) -- need to keep in touch with fam/friends 9. l'anza be long shampoo  10. eye makeup   3 things i would take with me to a deserted island  1. a man 2. chanel #5 3. birth control pills - an endless supply    YAAAAY FOR FRIDAY!!!!!!!!!!

						   M. turned 30 yesterday it was nice! we had pie, visitors all day.. there was pizza & much laughing and fun.  cards with money to put into the going to Canada account. that day will be a glorious day indeed. so, something slightly scary and difficult to process... ive been thinking about it nonstop since it happened and im not even quite sure how to word it. i suppose the only way is forward so! i see the number on the scale getting higher and im excited by that.  deep down i dont want it to get higher but i am happy with the number i see! is that crazy? im 5'7 and 103kg - 227lb - 16stone and the image i see in the mirror excites me. standing with M. infront of the mirror naked yesterday and seeing how much fuller & rounder i was than him excited me.  goddess defined. the 3kg i gained back went straight to my tummy & breasts. as far as i know im perfectly healthy - no diabetes or heart problems or anything else, i never get sick & when i do its usually a little headcold and is gone as quick as it came - 3 days max.   wow, its kind of hard to admit since being fat is looked upon so negatively  -- maybe im just rebelling against society & their dieting expectations, who knows!  one thing im not happy with is my activity - lack thereof.  if someone needs a loving family for an active dog (needs to be good with cats & stairs) i will open my home to him/her. i will not pay for the dog, if a good home is a necessity i will offer that but i cannot pay.  food & vet is different but buying a dog isnt an option... when i blew up like a baby blimp when i was 10 or 11 i lost ALLLLL the weight again mostly by walking my dog constantly and i do miss that along with the affection they give. since i cant participate in the activities i long to, here -  beach combing, mountain trekking, cross country skiing, kayaking/canoeing  i will go for my next choice - dog walking.   i never saw the point in walking down a street just for fitness, its pointless to me :-P walk a dog or go hiking!   anyway, rambling on to other things....  how about meal time? thats always fun! i love cooking & knowing what other people are cooking!! for breakfast i had  a bowl of fruit'n'fibre & all-bran plus with milk  for lunch i will make .. ummmmm..  hummus -- chickpeas/garlic/lemonjuice etcetcetc all blended up in a foodprocessor and serve it with toast & sliced veggies  forrrrr a snack i will have a cup of green tea with honey, an apple & a glass of milk with a spoonful of nesquick  for dinner im making steamed prawns marinaded in a yummy spicey combo of red thai curry paste, honey & olive oil.  lay them on a bed of sticky rice &  either corn on the cob and waldorf salad OOORRRR corn on the cob and greek salad.  i think the greek salad because i want to use those olives before they go bad  for dessert -- fresh cherries & a glass of milk (with a spoon of nesquick of course since i DESPISE milk but need 3 servings/glasses a day to get my calcium requirements)  if i get munchies in the evening i will probably airpop some popcorn and sprinkle some popcorn seasoning over it as usual (i have salt&vinegar and dill pickle seasonings) yum.   on to other things. everyone has regrets right?  how come mine come back to haunt me in my dreams over and over and OVER again? i wake up confused & distraught and wanting to go back to those times to make everything right. i regret but ONE teency thing i did (or rather didnt do) in my entire life and the person involved keeps showing his face in my dreams -- of course he probably looks nothing similar to what he used to but thats beside the point. anyway, sometimes i just wish i could go back to that day and do things properly.   thats all im going to say about that. M. understands the whole situation but it doesnt make things any easier.  i want to say damn you JD but i cant, its not your fault its my own stupid fault and i desire more than anything to change things but i cant and now that ive finally got it all out in the open please PLEASE stop haunting my dreams :)  just thinking about it makes me start glowing -- because women dont perspire, we glow -- dint you know? heh.    INXS-needyoutonight  YES!!!!  Come over here  All you got is this moment The twenty-first century's yesterday You can care all you want Everybody does yeah that's okay  So slide over here And give me a moment Your moves are so raw I've got to let you know I've got to let you know You're one of my kind  I need you tonight 'Cause I'm not sleeping There's something about you girl That makes me sweat  How do you feel I'm lonely What do you think Can't take it all Whatcha gonna do Gonna live my life

						   i found this at one of the journals i read regularly and it looked fun so i gave it a shot!!!  wow.  colombia. its pretty jungly there. RAWR.  the second time i did it i came out as the states... M. did it twice, first coming out as the United Nations then as Chile          You're Colombia!      You do a lot of drugs, and these have kind of distorted your view of  reality, to the point that everyone looks like an enemy. &nbsp;You keep trying to restore  order over your schizophrenic world view, but you don't even know which goal is your own  and which is someone else's. &nbsp;You're pretty sure someone needs to be punished for all  this, but who that is changes all the time. &nbsp;Things would be a lot better for you if  you switched to coffee, or even to decaf, but all this money would be hard to give up.    Take the  urlLink Country Quiz  at the  href="http://bluepyramid.org">Blue Pyramid         i also took the which book are you....  and i have to admit, its pretty accurate -- scary, except for the water buffalo thing although producing mozzarella for the masses might be something im meant to do in my next life.  MOOOO        You're  The Things They Carried !   by Tim O'Brien     Harsh and bitter, you tell it like it is. This usually comes in short, dramatic spurts of spilling your guts in various ways. You carry a heavy load, and this has weighed you down with all the horrors that humanity has to offer. Having seen and done a great deal that you aren't proud of, you have no choice but to walk forward, trudging slowly through ongoing mud. In the next life, you will come back as a water buffalo.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .      thats my fun for the day. it being movie night and all, i think we will watch... mmm... we did get a few movies on sale, if we dont watch them all in 1 night theres enough for 1 movie per week for 5 weeks.  maybe we'll watch the Birdcage tonight.    stop dieting & start living.  thats all i have to say about that!

						   its a tad cooler today than it has been the last while so im taking the opportunity to get as much done as possible!  my first load of laundry is almost finished! woohoo!! then its on to clean the kitchen, get some groceries, clean the bathroom, sweep, cook dinner & overal just relish in the fact that i dont need the airco for the first time in what feels like forever!! i really hope this change signifies the near end of summer, i would like to get back to the gym eventually &amp; start keeping the front balcony door open for the fresh cool breezes again... yummy cool fresh weather how i do love you! on another note we had a nice crepe style anniversary dinner last night.  i had 1 forest fruit crepe & 1 cream crepe.   then we had some boerencake which is just a long thin loaf of white cake with a slight lemony twinge.   i had 4 thin slices, a couple with nutella, 1 with cream & 1 plain. i woke up this morning about 6 with the worst heartburn in the history of the world!! how fascinating is that? :D  heh.  anyway usually i just roll onto my left side and go back to sleep but this was soooo bad it was burning its way up even while i was on my left side!!!! so i trudged into the kitchen for a glass of milk and headed back to sleep. aaahhhhh sweet relief it was. well, i certainly wont be eating those things again ... EVER.  it was so painful. i felt the holes boring through my esophagus, ok im a tad dramatic but you get the idea.  *yawn* almost friday!! Marcel has a little delivery job, he starts today at 13:00 which i think is just an orientation and tomorrow is the actual delivery?? im not quite sure but we will find out soon....  now off to do more laundry!!!! :D

						   well here we are, 7 years later...  i remember the night we met very well.  you & Ma &amp; An  sitting outside on the terrace, waiting for me to arrive so you all could show me around the centrum on my first weekend in The Netherlands.  I remember my Dad brining me to meet Ma, but since he didnt have a car to drive he had to call you to take us out.  you know what?  im really glad he didnt have a car otherwise we never would have met.  That you had just broken up with whatsherface that morning also proves true, im positive we were supposed to meet that night. i was physically attracted to you from the first moment we met & i remember asking you out at the end of that night, we went out the following wednesday and the rest is history! we shook hands, we played pool, i drank too much then we sat at the bar talking all night until it was time to leave.   i sure did want to shag you.  hehe.

						   wow, 2nd entry of the day!  isnt that fun!  well, we got a call from one of the temp agencies, the woman said shes having trouble placing M. because of the whole having a business thing.  all the ICT companies are convinced that he's a spy and will steal all their clients & all their oh so top secret information. heh.  my husband... a spy.  right,  thats more my frontier thanks.. hes as honest as they come! anyway, so he cannot get an ICT placement ...  but anything other than that they look at his resume and downright refuse because hes over qualified. well bend me over and spank me silly but since when is a computer geek overqualified to clean a toilet? a damn monkey could do that kind of job, who cares about his past record. i assure you he CAN and he WILL clean your toilet. and do a damn good job of it... for 50 euros an hour *cough*   no, really though...   what are these people thinking? he can do the work so whats the problem.  i guess its back to the drawing board again.  Marcel is almost finished his debian linux and is onto testing platforms and then itll be time to get it out to clients! it still doesnt change the fact that we need some income now but honestly? i think we will be ok.  this is our personal rock bottom and im positive that if we dont lose the house it can only get better from here! :) yes!! thinking positive thoughts!  mmm i love cranberry juice.

						   thaaaats ok. Marcel seems sooo excited these days that soon when hes started selling his unix that we will have a decent income which is true but ive done the calculations and we need to sell it to AT LEAST 400 clients to be 'ok' . if the tax service wasnt taking 62%  then we could do alright with fewer clients but the dutch tax service is a freaking joke & its surprise any business here makes it at all!  the bankruptcy rate is like 70% in the first 3 years, doesnt that tell them something???  they really are the biggest morons that walked the planet. it makes me SO ANGRY my blood boils and i get all sputtery just trying to talk about it.   this is a great country, TO VISIT.  do not, under any circumstances ever come to live here.  unless you are from a poor developing country & have 10 children because... well, then you know you will have a ton of money and a fabulous house &amp; everything will be taken care of.   those of you who work hard and do your best to make money??? go to Belgium, its safer.  anyway, enough about that before my head explodes from anger.  so tonight is movie night! yippe!!  i cant wait... i want to have some doritos & caffeine free diet coke, cause thats the only way to go :D i could talk about my wonderful weight loss but thats for http://thoseweightythings.blogspot.com/ my weight loss blog only.  its going well, thats all i want to say :)  oh! i got a new bankcard! how fun is that... although i have to actually GO to the bank to activate it which sucks because its like 93465 degrees out there. i'll just wait until my old one really expires... i dont need to do internet banking that badly anytime soon anyway!  i want to say CONGRATS to my friend L. whos daughter was born this past monday congrats you lovely lady you!  shes wanted to have children forever it seems & now she has a pretty little girl all to herself.  well, and her fiancee but thats another story.  im off now! to enjoy the weekend.  after posting in weightythings first of course. take care all  xoxox

						   well we did get the call last night...  exact words *we dont think you would fit into our team*  marcels translation *they think im overqualified, dammit i knew this would happen*    well, its back to the drawing board.  sometimes i wonder if we will ever have a steady paycheck again but thats the risk of being self-employed and i told him i would support him through it all and i will! i remember reading some statistics somewhere some time ago and they said all successful business generally hit rock bottom once or twice before becoming truly successful.  maybe this should be comforting.  because if the tax people come knocking on our door we will have to file bankruptcy which i suppose isnt the worst thing that could happen, we still get to live in our home dont we? i was never completely clear on the way it works... maybe i should do some research.  anyway on a lighter note, ive lost almost 4lb so its a step in the right direction.  portioning is not as difficult as i thought it was going to be.  i just say to myself if it fits in my 1 cup measuring cup then its 1 portion :D   simple enough right :D  except popcorn, which is 3 cups of popped to 1 portion so i usually have 6 cups ... wait.   enough about that.  thats what the diet blog is for :-P  its still really hot.  and i want to bitch and whine about it because im sweltering to death but i know it will be over soon... few more weeks and autumn should begin! COME ON AUTUMN!!! bring on the cool fragrant breezes & the beautiful, stimulating colours!!! i cant wait :D  okie, M. will be home any moment so i should start cooking the chicken &amp; boiling the pasta for lunch.  yes, a hot lunch today. well call me crazy but i need to use that chicken, it expired yesterday and i dont want to throw anything out especially since we're going through some hard times right now.  waste not want not.  whatever that means.  cheerio darlings xox

						   today M. had an interview for a callcentre Unix job... im feeling positive about this although he said the test he took was all microsoft based and hes not sure how he did. im sure he got the majority right, so we will see sometime today if he will be hired. i have a teency feeling they might tell him hes overqualified but hopefullyHOPEFULLY that doesnt happen. it will be a secure paycheck for as long as he wants and only a 30min drive from here! an international company he will answer questions about unix all day long. i suppose thats something along the lines of a helpdesk job?! its not his favourite thing in the world but i know he can do it & its a steady paycheck. minimum wage (about 400euros less per month than he was making at the manual labour production line last week) so that will bring in enough to pay mortgage &amp; bills &amp; the 500euro per month mandatory payment to the business credit account. slowly but surely things will pick up! lets hope the news they call with later on is positive news! if it is, he can start on tuesday! so a week to go. i have to admit i will miss him during the day but also relieved. i miss my time alone. except for long i wont have my time alone anymore because i have to get a job too! of course i will eventually but now i will enjoy being alone for as long as i posibly can.  its cooled off quite a bit today, its only about 26 in our apartament so ive done a couple loads of laundry already. a few more to go! yes, a woman must take full advantage of the breaks in the summer heat. if im lucky it will just keep getting cooler though :)  *Sigh* Canada becomes more of a reality every single day.

						   yes, the only problem was the site where i host the photo! no worries, all is normal in the world again. i hope.  my weight loss blog is all up and running now, since saturday.  http://thoseweightythings.blogspot.com/  im still changing a few things... i love green but i hate the layout. i like everything on the lefthand side! so i'll change things as i figure out what i want.  had a great chat with mum last night on the phone - we talk every sunday. my sister is off to spend a week with her beau on the other side of the country, i hope she has a good time! we discussed the idea of me going back to stay with them while M. stayed here working things out but all in all M. and i came to the final conclusion that 2+ years is indeed too long to be apart despite ours being a mostly long distance relationship. in our 7 years together 4 of them have been spent together. married. so 3 years of long distance but never more than 6 months without a visit. so even for a strong couple 2 years without a visit can be trying.... on anyone really. so. thats that.  im reading heaven & earth right now, the second book in the three sistors trilogy... i just love these books so much, i devour them -- like cake! without the calories :D the satisfied feeling sure is the same though ;)  i dont have too much to report... its still as hot as ever, my laundry is piling up because i dont want to run the dryer &amp; my countertops are crawling (literally) with dirty dishes because when im hot it means im extra lazy and i just cant get anything done in this weather. except read. and drink cold things. and type a word here and there.  still no news on the job front. being patient.  not pulling out hair.  taking deep breaths. calm. shh  and that about sums it up! toodles

						   what is up with the damn photo? M. says its corrupt or something but it works in other places i have it posted...   hm. maybe i should try to use a different one? but i liked that one so much!! it made me look like i had some colour! when in reality im pasty pale seethrough white.   oh,  with pink undertones it seems.  we watched brokendown palace last night, made me cheer for friendship. it was a slow in parts movie but had some good bits like cockroaches and dramatic moments.  i wouldnt buy it but it was worth seeing once. yeah, i'll try another photo right now actually....  i'll post more later.  maybe.
