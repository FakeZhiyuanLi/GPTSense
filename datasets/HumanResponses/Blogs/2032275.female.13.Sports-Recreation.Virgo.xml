       urlLink    haha.. this is part of my youth group when we were doing a game at the annual picnic.. who can drink down the water in a baby bottle the fastest? Ashley (white shirt) won. The most awesomest guy, the one from Columbia, Joey, is in orange, and i'm the one in the back in brown. Gosh, this was a messed up game. Anyway, much much much better today. I'm talking to Joey right now actually. He is such a cool kid. I'm really glad he came to our church so we could become friends. My mom thinks he's nice too.. wow... he must be something special. Hopefully we can hang out later on this week. Ahh.. i love summer! Well, gonna go now. I'll post later, when i actually have something intelligent to say. Stealing Kyle's closing.. Laterz!&nbsp; urlLink

      I just thought i'd post before going to bed.. kinda get stuff off my mind, you know? I feel so strange right now.. kinda happy, but depressed at the same time. I think I'm plagued with insomnia right now. I miss people too. I mean, schoot is horrible in its own right, but at least I get to see my friends! Haven't talked to Scott since 11:45 on Wednesday afternoon. I miss talking to him. Kyle's going over to his house tomorrow, and I told him to tell Scott i said hi.. hopefully this will jog his memory so he'll contact me. I just kinda need someone to be there. The only person that will listen and actually sympathize right now would be Andy, but there's no way in blue blazes i'm going to talk to that self-deprecating Nemesis. But anyway.. we might be moving. My parents are trying to, at least. I want to. A new house would be nice, and I can get out of my hideous purple room that sends me back on a warped trip to a 70's and Victorian times love child. I also talked to Joey. He told Ashley he liked her today. I guess that's good, since she's been all but worshipping the ground he walks on during the past few weeks. Still, it makes me kinda lonely. Once they have each other, where will I be? Alone, once again. I suppose being alone is not a bad thing, even the Apostle Paul called the state of being single a gift. Yet, a gift is the farthest thing from what it all feels like. I just want to fly away, drown out all this mess, and live in a fairy-tale. Yet, i know that that happy world of true love, perfect lives, and no tears doesn't exist, at least on this earth. So i'll have to do with what I have. Hopefully something will come along soon that will revolutionize my world, my summer, my life. I know what I need, but I don't want to face it. I don't need another relationship or more friends, or the perfect life. I need to dive into God. Right now that prospect scares me. I don't know why, since I know that being in God is the best place to be. Still, it's like the connection isn't there. I know that it's my fault, that God's just waiting there with open arms, wanting to hold me and have all my fears and doubts and problems disappear. I just can't run to Him. It's like my feet are rooted in this valley, and I can't move. I can look to where I've come from and where I could go, but I can't make myself move forward. This is the strangest place to be, where you feel powerless to change something in your life, even though you know just what to change and how to change it. Perhaps a good night sleep will clear things up a bit. I think i've written quite enough. I'm going to bed. If any1 at all has read through this whole thing, you're amazing for putting up with me. Leave a comment and tell me so I can congratulate you! heh.. G'nite all! *~* Christa *~*

      Wow... my life is so strange. It's like one minute i'm flying high, and the next i'm so low it's sickening. My emotions are going nuts right now... but on a happier topic, the last two days were pretty darn cool. Oh man, my mom just came in and yelled at me for the millionth time 2day.. gosh, but anyway. At 6:30 on Wednesday, my youth group went to Tiajuana Flats. The food sucked, but we (Ashley , Joey, and I) had fun. Then I went ot Missi's church, and we went bowling with her youth group. Michael wuz there. Dude, he is so awesome. I'm really glad he came. We've known each other for like forever, and we have so much fun together. I'm glad we're friends...oh haha, i just remembered. He wuz wearing this Quicksilver shirt that was stretchy! it was so cool! ya, but anyway, then I went to Missi's house and Mary, Missi, Mandy, and I watched ROTK. We finished at like 3:45.. dude it was so funny. When Pippin's song came on, we like rewound it 5 times and sang along.  Home is behind.  The world ahead.  And there are many paths to tread.  Thru shadow to the edge of night.  Until the stars are all alight.  Mist and shadows, cloud and shade.  All shall fade.  All shall  fade. Ya.. so anyway, then we went to bed, but we talked for like 2 more hours. We started talking about what guys we knew now that we thought would be good with the other people. For Mandy, it was this guy that doesn't go to our school.. hehe.. for missi, this guy that DOES go to our school. And for Mary and I, 2 guys that are in our social circle. I won't say mine.. just in case he reads this journal.. cuz like, i don't think i like him like that.. for now anyway ^_~ then we went to bed, and we woke up at 10:30. we had pancakes and fruit, then we got dressed and did makeovers. Dude, that was awesome. Then we had to leave for Sandra's party. We got there, and michael was already there (we hadn't seen each other for what, like 7 hours? hahaha). We got our shoes and started bowling. We had a lot of fun. There was this one time during the party where we were all chasing each other with icing, and that wuz cool. And Mary has the longest tounge in the universe (lol) and Missi was putting icing on Mary's nose and Mary would lick it off. Mary was all like, "This is my spiffy talent," and Michael goes, "watch my talent." He goes to get the icing and Missi put some on his nose, and he's all like no! and he took some icing, put on my nose, and pretended like he was going to lick it off. It was so funny!!! haha.. but then we decided to go to a movie.. we were going to go see "New York Minute", but the next showing was at 7:30.. so we decided to go to "13 going on 30.." and that's where i'll stop for today.. more later!

       urlLink    Just thought I would post this picture I found of me and my sister. We look so happy.. so peaceful. Haha.. this picture needs a reality check. Anywayz, just got home from exams. I had Christian Living and English Honours today. They were pretty easy. English was actually kinda fun.. if exams can be fun. Then after every1 wuz done wit the exam, we all sat around n talked n played cards. Dude.. the most annoying kid was in there tho. He shall remain unnamed... but he's like obsessed with getting me and Scott to go out. I guess he doesn't understand the concept of not wanting to go out at this time. And plus.. scotty has to ask me on a date first. So there! haha.. well i'm gonna go be lazy for another hour and then i'll get to studying for my 2 exams tomorrow. Gosh, does life ever slow down?&nbsp; urlLink

      Just got back from my church picnic. OOO what fun that was. hehe.. actually it was fun. The new kid, Joey, from Columbia was there and we played a lot of youth games and I had snow cones like crazy, and Ashley and I raced through the inflatable obstacle course. Omg.. it was so funny. We fell on top of each other, and couldn't move, and Joey and Dan were just sitting there laughing at us. I think my stomach is permanently compressed. lol.. so ya, i'd better go and study for exams. Only 3 more days of school left. I'm gonna miss some people.. dude, summer rox, but it's harder to see people. Hopefully I can do like tons this summer and see every1 a heck of a lot. So ya.. i gtg study for English. Love y'all..   Drifting in between a state of dreams and reality,    oh, and by the way, kenesis is actually spelled kinesis,          *~*

      Oh boy.. here I go, starting another blog. But hey, maybe this one'll stay for a while.   Exams are next week.. i'm really worried, but at the same time, i'm pretty sure I'll do ok. Then.. after the horrid exams, comes summer. W00t! I'm more than excited about that.  The Eagles lost last nite.. it was a really sad game 6 to 38.. of course, it's only spring football, so it doesn't count.. i just hope they get a heck of a lot better in the fall.  I just found out one of my best friends is moving to Texas. How horrible is that???? She's having a going-away party next weekend. Gosh, i'm really going to miss her!  Through the Door of Kenesis....

      I AM ON THE INTERNET!!! w00t. my mother is wonderful. but anwyay. Disregard everythign I said about joey and all last nite. Things are totally turned around. We are all friends, and that's all there is to it. It's kinda a relief actually, for this whole ordeal to be over. Joey said it was "God's decison", so in my mind, it has to be the best one, for some reason. God knows best. He knows my thoughts and dreams, and he knows Joey's, and Ashley's, and he knows whats gonna happen in our futures. I suppose he's the best qualified to give Joey advice. Another thing. I wanna be in a super-de-dooper cool band. The only one I know of is Joey and Michael's.. hmm... :-D guys? lol.. jk.. I'm gonna go talk to Joey now. I'll post later. Bye! "Can I get a what, what?

      Hey y'all its me.. posting again at nite.. yet this time it won't be a depressing entry, i don't think anyway. lol. But getting back on track, Joey just posted, so i felt bad leaving you with just that REALLY depressing entry, so i figured I'd post. well.. i was feeling all happy.. until a minute ago when i read Ashley's latest entry. It made me cry. Ya, but anyway, I'll try to suck it up and remember the happiness I felt a sec ago. Well.. Joey got off at 6:15 and didn't get back on till 9:02. It was torture for Michael and I, although we came up with a truckload of new inside jokes and planned all the awful stuff we were gonna do to joey, and i promised him a million bucks. Hmm.. now where to get all that money. lol.. he deserves it tho, he spelled llama right!!!! YAY FOR MICHAEL!! but anyway, then michael called joey and we had a delayed conversation thru michael and he was insulting me like crazy.. haha.. sometimes i wonder why I put up with that kid. Then he came back on, finally, and he finished his blog entry. I posted a comment, and he read it, although it took him a really long time!! haha.. special people, right michael? Then he goes, first off, thanx (cuz i said a lot of nice stuff) and then he said that it made him remember the crush calculator. I felt kinda bad then, and i was like *nervous laugh* oops? He said, no no, don't be sorry. I'm really happy. Then he had to sign off. I had to wonder at that comment. What made him so happy? Maybe I'm overanalyzing things. I'm sure Michael will read this and think i'm way off... haha.. but i dunno... could there be something there? I dare to hope, dare to dream.. speaking of dreams, i'm gonna go to bed. But still, i have to wonder. Melin le, perhaps? hmm.. interesting. I won't be on tomorrow, cuz i promised my mom so i could stay on this late. I probably won't be on a lot of tues either.. oh well.. fun comes at a price. I'll post again ASAP. Later kids! haha  ~*~ Christa ~*~   Current Mood: thoughtful Current Music: "Getting into you", the acoustic courtesy of joey version, is in my head.

      It seems like the weather always seems to be horrible when i'm having a depressed or lonely spell. Like it is now. It's raining, windy, thunder, lightning, all around nasty. Everyone seems to be doing something today... with other people. :-/ So i sit here, feeling rather alone, wondering when the sun is finally going to peek around the clouds, both figuratively and literally. Joey's over at Ashley's right now. I hope Ash knows I'm not trying to steal Joey from her. It isn't my fault that he supposedly likes me too... i was just trying to be nice. But no matter what he says.. i think that he'll either not make a decision, or he'll pick Ashley. I'm ok with that, really i am. It'll make my choice between Joey and Scott a heck of a lot easier. But still, what is wrong with this f-ing world? I'm alone.. pretty much always have been. The people my own age I can't relate with, and the people who are older than me, who i CAN relate with, shun me because they suddenly remember my age and inferiority. It totally sucks. First Ashley, then Natalia. Who will it be next? Scott, Joey, Kyle, Aubrey, Mary, Missi, Michael? The only one who really understands me is Simi, and she's halfway across the freaking world in Kenya, and will be for another month. While I'm ranting about people shutting me out.. another thing I hate is when people exclude me or tell me "i wouldn't understand" because they think i'm a goody-goody, shut off from the world and naive. Maybe they're right in a way. I haven't had sex or done drugs, or drank so much I had a hangover till six the next evening, or been raped, or had parents who basically didn't give a D@$% about me... ya that's true, i've had a pretty cushy life. But that doesn't mean I don't know that other people go thru those things. That doesn't mean that I should just be excluded because of what i've done or who I am. So, i haven't tried to kill myself with all the above mentioned things.. then what am I? A social reject for keeping myself pure???? When did this discrimination start? Sometimes I just wish I could end it all. The quick flash of a knife, the pull of a trigger, the split-second jump off a bridge or building.. they seem so appealing sometimes. I just can't bring myself to take the most precious thing I have, the gift of life. I want to make a difference, i want to change people's lives, I want to make something of myself... is that SO wrong? I JUST HATE IT ALL! What do I freaking need to do to be accepted? I can't change my age.. is that going to be a handicap for the rest of my life? No one will listen to me because I'm young? Paul told Timothy to not let anyone despise him because of him youth, but that he should be an example to others in word and deed. I want to, I'm trying.. but that just gets me more shut out. I can't take it anymore.  *~* Christa ~*~  Current Mood: totally angry about the bc that's goin on Current Music: You think I'm calm enough to listen to music?

      Here I go with another post derived out of the strange workings of my mind after 10 pm. Today was ok.. i guess. I cleaned a lot, and went in the pool a LOT, and sat around a LOT.. gosh.. i need to do more activities in smaller measure and get rid of these stupid freaking LOTS... so ya. I called Scott today, at around 5. We talked for about an hour.. although it was a really strange conversation because my sister would NOT leave us alone. It was so freaking a-n-n-o-y-i-n-g.. but yes, cool anyway. Hopefully we can get together soon!!! OH, I almost forgot. Go to: http://www.crushcalculator.com/cc.cgi?id=1086117760zhz... its REALLY REALLY cool.. well, maybe not really really cool, but it's really strange. It rates your "compatibility" with crushes. I did it and put in scott and then couldn't think of 2 other names, so i did Michael and Joey. Dude, the results were stinking hilarious. Oh my gosh, it's really late. I'll post more tomorrow. BYE! Love,   Christa   Current Mood:tired Current Music: NONE Random Thought: i am beginning to hate the sight of hugh dancy's face.  Spanish Version!!!! Aquí voy con otro poste derivado fuera de los trabajo extraños de mi mente después de 10 p.m. Hoy estuvo bien.. adivino. Limpié mucho, y entré la piscina mucho, y senté alrededor de mucho.. cielos.. yo me debo hacer más actividades en la medida más pequeña y se deshace de estos estúpido abigarrando el GRAN CANTIDAD... tan ya. Llamé Scott hoy, en alrededor de 5. Hablamos para acerca de una hora.. aunque fuera una conversación realmente extraña porque mi hermana no nos saldrían solo. Era tan abigarrando a-n-n-o-y-i-n-g.. pero sí, refresca de todos modos. ¡Optimistamente podemos juntarnos pronto!! AH, yo casi me olvidé. Vaya a: http://www.crushcalculator.com/cc.cgi?id=1086117760zhz... su REALMENTE REALMENTE fresco.. bien, quizá no refresca realmente realmente, pero es realmente extraño. Valora su "compatibilidad" con aplasta. Yo lo hice y puse en el scott y entonces no podría pensar en 2 otros nombres, así que hice Michael y Joey. El petimetre, los resultados olían hilarante. Ah mi cielos, es realmente tarde. Anunciaré más mañana. ¡ADIOS! El amor, Christa  El Humor actual: se cansó  la Música Actual: NINGUNO  Aleatorio Pensó: comienzo a odiar la vista de la cara de dancy de hugh.
