      FPGA RSAC MrSID MAC (not the computer) IMAP BPO OSDL GCC ATA GNOME     The Real Questions    For what organization does Mr. Linus Torvalds currently work? (IS03)   Who coined the term ‘bit’? (CF04)   Which organization sets the Ratings for web sites in Microsoft’s popular Internet Explorer web browser? (CF04)   While a student at Helsinki University, Linus Torvalds ran into an OS which inspired him to create Linux. Name that OS. (E03)   To activate the read / write head of the floppy diskette drive, which type of electric motor is used? (E03)   This legendary computer scientist has authored the ‘The Art of Computer Programming’. Who is this nut? (E03)   The ARPANET funded Project MAC (which led to the development of MULTICS - which in turn inspired Unix) was led by Prof Fernando J. Corbato on the IBM 7094 computer in 1963. Prof Corbato first devised the concept (now widely used in server operating systems) of "a continuously running process that stays in the background". He named it after "an imaginary agent which worked tirelessly in the background to sort molecules of different speeds", theorized by 19th century physicist James Clerk Maxwell. What's the concept? (E03)   The Chinese call it a little mouse, Danes and Swedes an elephant’s trunk, Germans, a spider monkey, Italians a snail and Israelis pronounce it as strudels. What am I talking about? (E03)   What is Usenet? (KM03)   Why was the name Slashdot coined? (KM03)

      Hi Did you hear that,yes , yes ,yes:3d labs is again on nvdia's heal.  Aword of the past: Sone years ago 3d labs made the first 3D graphic card.nVidia bought the company and slowly turned to the most popular and successful giant. Uptil now nVidia was win in the sphere of gaming from the only main company ATI:but for professionals and servers it was still the most popular and successfull.Until now when 3D labs decides to enter the professional field:Wildcat Realism vs nvidia's quadro.

       For the first time, I think Exun has been made an official school body. Along with the appointments for 2004-05, yesterday the Exun appointments were also announced. We'll be having dual-Presidency this year with me and Maanick. The third official post is that of 'Head of Programming' and Prateek Rungta is taking it up.  Of course, everyone isn't happy with this decision. It's also not all that good for us. I wanted to be a member of the Editorial Board, but now that Exun is an appointment and one person can have only one post, that will never happen. Also,  urlLink some alumni  don't like the idea of Exun becoming official. It has its advantages and disadvantages, but I hope it's all for the best.  Cheerio --Karan

       Right, this is an easy one. All you have to do is write a program.   Here is what it does:  The user is given a list of cards which are arranged in columns. He/She must choose a card and keep it in mind. Through repeated shuffling, the program will ask him/her to identify the column in which the card is. In the end the program tells the user his/her card. The cards in the columns are randomly selected into the column, that is, you can't decide the column in which a perticular card goes.   WARNING-- I have the source code that's available on the net for this, so don't try to give me gum.    ---- Bloodfist out.

        SpokesBlah Logs On   Greetings from your officially unoficial SpokesBlah. I would just like to point out that I'm not planning to sit on my ass and do nothing. I shall, indeed, be quizzing, speaking for exun, and I shall also be assiting in Talent Hunts, along with Presidents Sirs.

       Let's keep it plain and simple. Most of the members showed up. This log was discussed and the URL was given to all members, and if anyone's smart enough to log on to www.exunclan.com, they'll be able to make their way here.  So, anyway, this site serves the following purposes: - Serve the Exun members with news about upcoming events and competitions (including intra-school events and meetings) - It's a place where we will post Quizzing, Programming questions so that Exun members can hone their skills.  - Submit Reports like this one for the Exun community (and basically anyone else who cares to read) - A place where any Exun member can post an entry and be heard by everyone else. Comments help to communicate between authors and readers.  Apart from that, we announced that each Class (from VIII to XII probably) would be having a Domain Square representative who would be incharge of advertising and promotion for that class. This will help us make Exun kind-of object-oriented and easier to handle, especially in these gaming events in which the participation is large. By object-oriented, I mean to say that each person at his/her level gets his/her duties done and then reports to his/her superior. Just that. The superior shouldn't have to know what the person is doing or how he's doing it.  Maanick Nangia discussed his Project Billboard which should see growth over the next few months.   Exun made a call for new talent for the group, people who are not only skilled at what they do, but more important, sincere, assiduous and interested.  Oh yes, quite an important thing was that member photos got taken and the member list got updated, which shall be reflected on the website soon.  Mukesh Sir stressed the importance of the fact that Exun members need to keep interacting with each other, not only for the sake of it, but also in that it gives meaning to the fraternit&eacute; and everyone learns something or another from someone else.  Every Exun member shall be delegated tasks and given deadlines. These tasks and deadlines will be posted on ln(exun).  That's all folks --Karan President, I say

       Quite sad and sorry. Before I start with the bad, let me start with the good. The MJKPS Band is excellent, no mistaking. Those little kids play really really well. They played the National Anthem so well that it put some patriotism back in me, and I realised that yes, I did know all the words of the National Anthem, which I was muttering under my breath. For those who don't know, I really am not a very patriotic person, and neither am I religious (I'm practical an atheist, an unbeliever).  My only event today was the last event, so I had to pass my time in the Pandal watching Senior Declamation, which was good, I must say (it was on Outsourcing and how it's evil), but firstly, it wasn't a Declamation as they promised, but it was actually more of a Debate because some people were for, and some were against the motion, and secondly, all of the speakers (save one) missed two big fat important points (which I don't really want to discuss here) and that was just pathetic. Plus, I could see from their speeches that each of them had typed in "Outsourcing" into Google and they were all saying  exactly  the same things and quoting the same figures. That was that.   Senior Quiz  started a bit late, as expected. The quiz-master was an alumnus of the same school and it was obviously his first quiz (either that, or he's generally pathetic) and he was sweating like hell. This quiz even left Mr. Quizzer Outsourcer dazed (but not speechless). To answer each question, one was given a whopping  5 seconds!! For logic questions, 10 seconds. So, basically most teams weren't able to answer. The rapid fire round was 15 seconds each and at max. one could get three or four questions. Let me cut to the chase, we ended up getting second position. The quiz-master first announced us as the winners, then their scoring software coughed up a hair-ball and suddenly put this stupid school ahead of us by three points. With their Ahlconian attitude (long story about Ahlcon Public School... they disqualified us from the overall trophy for some null reason - basically, people who don't listen to reason), they didn't listen of course. I'm also very doubtful about their home-grown scoring software because it had previously added (right in front of the whole audience) 5+5+10 = 10. We didn't have a chance for the Overall anyway because numerous morons (namely: Gursartaj, Dhruv, Abhishek Suri, Abhisheyk Gaur, Manas Gautam, Mohit Taneja, et al) either didn't show up for this event or they didn't win anything (all but the last name are people who didn't show up because of pathetic reasons and they should be lynched in my humble opinion); hence, I chucked it and walked off carrying a 2nd Position trophy, which is extremely pathetic because I think that in a quiz, one should either bag the event or get nothing.  We won  Senior Programming !! I am so happy that SP is working out well because I didn't want Exun to lose its fort&eacute; while I'm in Presidency. I would obviously never want Exun to disregard its crux, but if it ever does, let it not be while I'm, uh,  in power . Mr. Azgez went home carrying two first position trophies from his first symposium, which I consider to be quite commendable.   --Karan Misra President, Exun  We take printouts

        Arrive at Mata Jai Kaur Public School: drum-guy of the marching band wearing the exact same sash as our head boys and head girls - totally ditto, same  chatai  material, colour, knot and everything. This school calls its computer competition Cyberfest (as you would probably have noticed), but wait, its computer club is called WHIZKIDZ. Next, they don't even have an auditorium; we were seated in a  Pandaal , which would be more suited to a  langar  than a computer competition. The chief guest looked like he was the school's peon, with his  chaprasi  clothes and simply horrid grammar. We did ourselves the courtesy of not listening to him, and instead munching on our lunch boxes (in my case, of course, munching on  other  peoples' tiffins).   The first event was Senior Quiz Preliminary Round. I was quite pissed off because it started an hour late, and Bhavya was even more pissed off, because after seeing the question paper, he realised that it was all technical. I managed to get sixteen out of twenty questions  pucca  right, guessed on three and left one.  Result : We got the   first position   in the written preliminaries.  The second event was Linux Programming. I've always thought of myself as a seriously pathetic programmer at computer symposia, who couldn't program even to save his life. That changed today. It was Linux programming of course, which means that there's less of logic and more of "knowledge". You have to "know" the arcane commands in Linux. For example, in normal computer languages like C++ and BASIC, 'if' statements are either if...else, if..then..else, or if...then...else...end if, but in Linux, it's if...then...elif...fi. Sorry to geek you people out, but it simply looks stupid. Here's where we prospered. You see, Mr. Azgez (Exun Programmer 2004-05) agreed to learn these arcane commands and so he did, and with efficiency, over the weekend. Hence, we were the only team to actually type something meaningful on the computer. The logic for all the questions was easy, but we couldn't attempt one question due to knowledge and time restraints.  Result : Came   first    Third event was Extempor&eacute;. I'm really not good at it. I got a topic like "Computers have destroyed writing form and expression." I occupied two minutes of the judges' time and got out.   Result : Nothing  In totality, both the quizzing teams qualified, no one qualified for extempor&eacute;, we bagged Linux but those hapless tenthies and ninethies couldn't win a thing, neither the digital imaging competition (apparently, in which, they  lost  their file) nor in hardware assembly (in which they put in the CD-ROM drive upside down).  --Karan Misra President, Exun

       Ahha! Bloodfist has finally been added to one of the busiest clans in our school... lemme give him a briefing ... Exun has now taken the lead in printing documents, producing perfect jackasses and all other sorts of useless stuff. Nevertheless Exun has been appreciated before . I recently met an alumni of our school who was a commercie. She was the Spokeperson of Exun.. Helped in organizing Exun events once or twice... She had only 1 thing to say : "I had never seen such loyalty of the members in a DPS club.. One comment against the club and all Juniors were ready to Murder you"  That was Exun of 1998. Its 2004 now but Exun has actually deteriorated. We have some of the biggest loonies of our school in Exun now. Exun now entering officialdom is now gonna go down even further. Next year is a 'Big Worry'. We have no suitable successor to presidentship (even this year, one of the presidents is a perfect jackass.No prizes for guessing who it is). What shudders me more is that in 2007 Exun will go into the Hands of (Gulp!!) Gursartaj and Gang.. Then i think the club will be fit for dissolution. Exun scaled many heights but now signs of wear and tear are showing. We need a Fresh Approach .. A new Beginning.. We need to do something or else we might go the Intercrap Club Way  Thanks for Listening to my crap which is nevertheless important

       You were expecting maybe Ben Kingsley??   Yes Ladies and Gents, believe it or not after years of deliberations and months of haggling with exun bureaucracy (our hon'able head of programming), I am finally here.   They have us going to this cyberfest thingy. We need someone for linux programming and up until now, all the presidents are in agreement. We don't have a linux programmer. So if anyone has any secret skills with linux, you will please disclose them now. Better yet, talk to Rungta (you know, the H.O.P.). Oh and Karan, if you read this, why don't you put up who is doing what (who goes for what event)  up here, God knows this blog needs purpose.  --Bloodfist out.

       This log shall have to be make more esoteric as nobody really cares to post on general matters, or at all. Shame on the other President and the other thirty or so members.  In the news, the three of us Exun appointees have to go for the March Past just like the rest of them appointees. I wouldn't really mind doing it, because it's not really something that involves a lot of physical exertion or anything, however, it does require me to miss classes, something that I'm vehemently against. Fortunately, the Investiture Ceremony is now in August (assumably on the day of the Independence Day assembly). We did get our badges. I'll probably scan them or take a photo of them and post it on either this log or my blog. They had the option of choosing from a Rs. 20 and a Rs. 25 badge, they however, went for the Rs. 5 badge or so I like to call it. It's plain bad, and looks CHEAP - made of cloth, golden border, sickly green background and Orange text.  The school has been getting new PCs recently, and I'm glad to say that Mr. Mukesh has finally got a beautiful black HP PC (though crap config, 2.8 GHz and a paltry 248 MB RAM, 8 MB shared with Video). As expected, I knew he'd be sad because he has to run Windows XP now, and like, Windows 98 is the second love of his life. He never fails to tell me (whenever I touch this topic) that Windows 98 gives you full control while Windows XP and all seem to control you. I'd usually tell him that it's a load of bull and that's what I did today as well.  --Karan

       Will you teach me what are message boards and forums.At one time i was the most frequent posters at thinkdigit.com/forums and forums.anandtech.com . Also i am a member at blog.chip-india.com and pchardware.com . If you know people post posts for 2 reasons,they want to help the other person out:tell him waht all above mentioned things are wrong or right and be to the point.Secondly it could be to continue with an incomplete conversation,as time passes it doesn't remain a formal post but a 2-3line amedment and conversation or sometimes even joking and not really that rude as i was with Mohit.

       First of all before the attitude problemo lemme point out the fact that 90% of exun members dont know the difference between a 'Blog Post' and a 'Comment'. Please refer to your dictionary, glossary reference, etc etc. Now All those smarty pants who just appreciate their own contribution and not others are requested to join the IdioticExunites Clan. The First two members have been decided  Akshay  Gursartaj. All others members who like to settle their personal scores on the  Natural Log of Exun  may also apply to join this Clan

       This Story is from MSNBC.msn.com    The Ultimate Computer   Earlier this week I wrote about the ongoing addition of feature after feature to cell phones-most recently, satellite TV. I suggested we're at the start of a dramatic period of rapid technical evolution, wherein our information and communications devices are going to morph into all kinds of new combinations. One reader commented:   Name: Joe Hometown: Fort Worth When you continue to add all these features to different sorts of devices, I can see everyone in the not-so-distant future carrying their "life" with them in the form of some electronic piece of equipment. Just another thing people will be slaves to.  Exactly right, Joe -- although, I think it's up to us as to whether we're the slaves of these devices, or vice versa.  However, besides cramming next-generation computing and communication into a single personal device, there's another element we need: massive information storage, so we can archive everything we do in life, from e-mail to photos to videos, and have it all available at our fingertips. And that's exactly the direction that Google's one-gigabyte, highly-searchable GMail could take us.  About ten years ago I asked Steve Jobs for his vision of the ultimate computer -- the machine that might be possible midway through the 21st century. He said it would be a flat, tablet-like device that you might get as a child; you'd unwrap it, and, via speech and voice recognition, it would ask your name, where it was and then begin learning everything about you.  You'd carry it everywhere: do your homework on it, store all your books and correspondence, and it would subtly integrate itself into your life. It would ask, for example, where you were going and you'd say, "To my tennis lesson," and it would respond "Would you like me to remind you about your tennis lesson at this time every week?" And then finally, Jobs said, you'd be 17 or 18 years old, sitting on your bed talking to your computer, and you'd mention that you'd just broken up with your girlfriend. And the computer would say, "Steve, it's the third time it's happened that way. You want to talk about it?"  Perhaps that will always be science fiction. But this decade we're seeing the elements of that vision start to come together. Our computers still need to get much smarter, of course, but the ingredients of constant connectivity, massive memory and friendly interface design are on finally on the way, and it's going to be an interesting ride for the next few decades.

       Question 1  The Nilgiri Tahr  The Nilgiri Tahr is a mountain goat that lives in the Nilgiri hills on the border between Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The tahr lives along steep rock cliffs where grass does not grow easily. The tahr is a very good climber and can balance itself even on the steepest of cliffs. However, since it is a rather short animal, it cannot jump from one rock to another if the difference in height between the rocks is more than one foot. One such tahr finds itself at the top-left corner of an M x N rectangular grid of rocks. There is a clump' of grass at the opposite (bottom-right) corner. The tahr would like to find a way from its current position to the grass. The tahr cannot jump over rocks and can move from a given rock to only one of its four neighbours (left, right, up or down). The tahr must of course always stay within the grid. Further, remember that it can jump only one foot up or down, so it can move from a rock to its neighbour only if the difference in height between the two rocks is at most one foot. Your task is to help the tahr find such a path to the grass, if it exists. If there is more than one valid path for the tahr to follow, it is sufficient to identify anyone path. For example consider the following grid of rocks, where the number at each position in the grid indicates the height of the rock, in feet, at that position.    7	9	8	5  6	3	2	4  5	4	1	5  2	6	1	1  Here is a path that the tahr can follow to reach the grass. The path follows the rocks labelled by the letters (a), (b), ..., (i), in that order.    7 (a)	9	8	5  6 (b)	3 (e)	2 (1)	4  5 (c)	4 (d)	1 (g)	5  2	6	1 (h)	1 (i)  Input format The first line of input contains two integers M and N, specifying the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively, where 1   Output format. 	. If there is no path for the tahr to reach the grass. print out a single line containing thenumber O.  . If there is a path, the first line of output should be the integer 1. After this, you have 	to print out anyone path that the tahr can follow to reach the grass. The path is  1 described by a sequence of lines. Each line should consist of two integers. The integers Xi and Yi printed out on line i indicate that the ith step that the tahr takes should be to row Xi and column Yi. Since the tahr always travels from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid, the first line of the path is always 1 1 and the last line is always M N.  Example Here is sample input and output corresponding to the example discussed above.  Sample input  4  4 7 9 8 5  6 3 2 4 5 4 1 5  2 6 1 1  Sample output  1 1 1  2 1  3 1 3 2 2 2 2 3 3 3  4 3 4 4    Question 2 The Rajah's Wrestlers  Once upon a time, there lived a Rajah who was extremely fond of wrestling. In those days, wrestlers had supernatural powers. To win a match a wrestler relied not only on his own strength but also on a magical ring that he wore while fighting. This ring allowed a wrestler to gain additional strength proportional to the strength of his opponent. The strength of a wrestler and the magical power of his ring are both positive integers. When wrestler A fights wrestler B, the fight index of wrestler A for this match is given by A's own strength plus the strength of wrestler B multiplied by the magical power of A's ring. Each match is won by the wrestler whose fight index is higher for that match. For example, suppose that wrestler A has strength 10 and wears a ring whose magical power is 3 and wrestler B has strength 18 and wears a ring whose magical power is 4. If these two wrestlers fight each other, wrestler A wins. This is because A's fight index for this match is 10 + (3 x 18) = 64 while B's fight index for this match is only 18 + (10 x 4) = 58. On the other hand if A faces a wrestler C with strength 15 and a ring whose magical power is 5, then C wins. In this match, A's fight index is 10 + (3 x 15) = 55 while C's fight index is 15 + (5 x 10) = 65. Similarly, in a match between Band C, C wins. The Rajah organised a wrestling festival once a year. During this festival, each wrestler fought every other wrestler exactly once. At the end of the contest Rajahh honoured all the wrestlers by inviting them to his court and giving them gold coins. It was the job of the Minister to decide the order in which the wrestlers got to meet the Rajah. This was an important task, because our Rajah was rather eccentric. He had declared that the number of coins to be given to a wrestler was determined by the number of matches he won and his position in the sequence: a wrestler was given one gold coin for each match he won and one gold coin for each wrestler whom he defeated but who was ahead of him in.the line to meet the Rajahh. For instance if the Minister had presented the wrestlers A, Band C described above in the order A, B, C to the Rajahh, then A would get 1 gold coin (for the match he won against B), B would get 0 gold coins (since he won no matches) and C would get 4 gold coins (two for his wins against A and B, one because he beat A and A met the Rajah before him and one more since he beat Band B met the Rajah before him). Instead if the minister had presented them in the order C, A, B then C would get 2 coins (for his wins against A and B), A would get 1 coin (for his win against B) and B would get 0 coins.	. The Minister is concerned about the finances of the kingdom. and wants to minimise the number of coins handed out by the Rajah to the wrestlers. Your task is to help the .Minister decide the sequence in which the wrestlers should be presented to the Rajah so that the number of gold coins handed out is minimum. You are provided with the strengths of all the wrestlers and the magical powers of their rings. You may assume that these values are such that no match. results in a tie.  Input format The first line of input is an integer N indicating the number of wrestlers. Each wrestler is identified by a unique number in the range. {1, 2,. . ., N}. The next N lines each contain 2 positive integers. For 1      Output format The output consists of N lines, indicating the sequence in which the wrestlers should meet the Rajah to mini mise the number of gold coins handed out by the Rajah. Thus, each line of output should be an integer between 1 and N and every integer between 1 and N should appear exactly once in the output. If the integer on line i is j, it means that wrestler j is the ith wrestler to meet the Rajah.  Example Here is sample input and output corresponding to the example discussed above.  Sample input  3 103 184 155 Sample output   3 2 1   ps if doees not make any sence it is because of ocr email me and i will email you the jpg's mohittaneja@gmail.com

       I, Srajan and the gamers of the sections of Class 8th entered Computer Lab 6 in the 7th period. We were here for The Domain Square Gaming Competition which was for class 8th. The game to be played was Unreal Tournament. I saw the gleam in their eyes when the game was disclosed. The sections were divided into 2 batches comprising of 6  gamers each were from sections A-F and 6 from G-L. We (me and Srajan)gave them a practice session of 10 minutes and that is the time when we were bombarded with queries and to think Karan Misra entered at that time. But after that the competition went smoothly.   In the first batch (A-F) the gamers played in DM Stalwart map where you had a time limit of 10 minutes and you could kill as many people as you could. The 3 gamers who killed the most were to be selected from each batch for the final round.  The gamers who didn't make the final 3 went back to their classes with a heavy heart but with a smile.  In the second batch(G-L) the gamers were given DM Curse map. We selected 3 gamers again for the finals and said a goodbye to the other gamers after 10 minutes.   Now, call it luck or curse a section of X came for their class i.e. the eigth period(it stretched a little bit as we were giving tutorials to the gamers for playing the game). But everything was in control. The finals were played in the Deck 16 map where the six finalists got 15 minutes of play time where they could slaughter each other as many times they could in the time limit.  The gamers who came out victorious were- 1. Digvijay Singh of VIII-A 2. Aviral Goyal of VIII-G 3. Aman Gupta of VIII-F  It's upto Karan to decide what happens to them. We hope we would see more competitions in the near future. Special thanks to Karan Misra and Mukesh Nagpal and Mukesh Kumar sir for making this event possible.

       Hi. Just a piece of information on gmail. According to TIME gmail is right now being given to "friends and family" of google. It is also facing a trial in court for giving so much space i.e. 1 GB. It will most likely win. If gmail runs successfully for 6 months then it can be signed up by everybody. Except the fact of 1Gb MAIL free of cost gmail will also edit ur original messages by giving photos of whatever is written in the mail i.e. if a camera is typed then a colorful picture of a camera will be seen.

       For one I am incapable of making 5 pieces, and well I can't classify the three that I have, ergo these shall be forever be three pieces... Now as for these questions, at a minimum I expect Rungta, Azgez, and "the dormant female programmer in 12th/11th" (taken from somewhere on this blog, probably) to solve these, though if neone else does it, well &amp; good... If neone outside of Exun gets all three done, then well while I can't promise ur inclusion into the club (alumnus, can't really do that), however I can wud recommend that u be taken in, and well my recommendation wud probably work. For lack of time, and effort I haven't put the problems into a more succinct form, so ur gonna have to work around that. So there that gets the preliminaries out of the way.  Now for three simple rules   Contrary to popular belief, I do not have access to a grid or a super-computing facility, so make sure ur code can run in sane amts of time.  Some of these questions r solvable by a single mathematical equation, some by recursion. Now I am  not  a fan of simulations, so if u get the these done without simulating the actual process, then well u get more points in my book, not all that useful, but well u never know...  In code u submit to me, umm pls don't use a void main(), since as of  6 or 7 years ago,  ANSI regulations state that void main() is not a valid main funtion, use int main() instead, and return a value of 1.     The Questions     Throughout this question, the term line and ray are supposed to take on their usual mathematical meanings, which is to say that a line extends infinitely in an infinite two dimensional plane, and a ray starts of at a particular point, but directional extends unto infinity. The question assumes that ur working on an infinite 2d plain. Now the question itself is pretty simple, so there r two parts to it.  a)  Given n (n&gt;2) lines, what is the maximum number of regions u can divide ur 2d plain into?  b)  Now instead of lines if we used two rays at an angle, in a sort of V formation, what is the maximum number of regions with n (n&gt;1) Vs then?   There's a room with n walls (2&lt;n&lt;10), shaped like a regular n sided polygon, with a mirror on each wall. The first wall contains a light source, for which you have a given x coordinate and the angle between the light beam and the wall (horizontal angle, the light beam is so arranged that the beam itself lies on a plane parallel to the floor of the room), and given the x coordinate extents (two coords each) of each mirror, predict the number of reflections that take place before the beam is absorbed. Assume that walls themselves are perfect absorbers of light, as is the light source. Also predict the number of times the rays intersect....   A lil bit of military strategy. Umm well let's have this as a story. Ur in one of those essentially violent central African countries, a part of a rather underfunded UNPKF, and the only possibility of survival rests in understanding rebel attack strategies. Now the rebel army follows some very peculiar rules, for one they always conduct battles with 12 units, and all battles last for 16 hrs. The rebel army is strictly hierarchal, so much so that on the pain of death, each subordinate wud do whatever his superior's unit did and relay his superior's commands to his subordinates immidiately. Unfortunately the rebel army relies on an extremely slow, though highly successful means of communication, and each message takes an hour to relay, which is to say that each subordinate does what his superior did an hour ago. Now given that 1 represents attack, and 0 represents retreat, and given an hour by hour analysis of rebel movements, ur program shud figure out the hierarchy of the rebel army.  Every commander has a minimum of two subordinates.   For instance if the movements read something like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2  1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0  then u shud eventually find the following hierarchy Unit 3 commands Units 7 & 12 Unit 7 commands Units 1, 4 & 5 Unit 5 commands Units 2, 6 & 8 Unit 12 commands units 9, 10 & 11     Neways best of luck doing these, mail me the solutions at  urlLink aurojit@gmail.com , and well I'll test them and get back to u....

         urlLink      Today, Apple has previewed Mac OS X v10.4 codename "Tiger". Many of these features were supposed to be included in Microsoft's next version of Windows codenamed "Longhorn" due in 2007, but unfortunately Microsoft has withdrawn plans for some of the most salient features. To my surprise, Apple has managed to conquer the goal that Microsoft declared as too tough to make it even by 2007 - this was the searchable File System (also known as WinFS). Apple touts its new Search backbone as  urlLink "Spotlight"  and like Expos&eacute; was for Panther, Spotlight will be for Tiger. I shall not mention much more than what you can find out from  urlLink Apple's Tiger Website . However, it should be duly noted that Spotlight will be using metadata as one of its many criteria for searching.     Other important improvements in Tiger are Dashboard and Automator. Do check out Apple's website for more information if you so desire. In other important announcements, the most important is the announcement of a 30" LCD screen by Apple which would run at a resolution of 2560 by 1600 (very very very very big) and would need not only the most powerful graphics card available for the Mac platform but also two DVI connectors instead of one to feed it with the graphical data it so hungers for. Notice that it towers above the Power Mac G5 (which is much bigger than a normal tower PC itself).       --Karan

IF NO!!!  8 queens problem is - to place eight queens on a chess board i.e. on a 8x8 matrix in such a way that none of them clash each other.  (those who dont know how to play chess - queen can move in all the directions horizontal/vertical/diagonal)  So, now I am looking forward to a program written in any language - C++/Basic/VB/Pascal to provide all possible places on a chess board where 8 queen's can be placed.    Please do not submit downloaded program (from Web)! Only original entries will be entertained!!

       hi this is udit. we reached darjeeling on the 31st after a long drive ion the rain and fighting with a stupid taxi driver coz he couldn't find our hotel. the hotel turned out to be alright not very great. at least that's what i thought. it turns out they have 1 tv, 1 telephone and don't serve dinner a' la carte. they don't even have cold drinks. we were woken up at 4:00 to go to tiger's hill to see the sunrise but then it was raining and we had to go back to sleep. otherwise, darjeeling's a nice place to be. lots of places to visit. today we went to the zoo (fantastic), the tea gardens again very nice, japanese temple, peace pagoda- the buddha statue was huge, ava art gallery- you gotta see this. this lady has embroidered or painted pictures on velvet silk etc. and they look fantastic. there are plenty of nice places to eat and plenty of cyber cafes and bakeries. they have a huge mall too. everbody has got umbrellas thrice the size of normal ones. that's all for now. if anybody thinks this is pathetic just post a comment. udit

       In my humble opinion, the Class XI Domain Square has been the best-organized and best-performance Domain Square yet. Not only did the players fight each other like pros, but also there was very little chaos even though the computers had loads of viruses, and we did not have to resort to rude language with anybody. Also, just the right number of people showed up and were finished in just one batch.  The game was timed (15 minutes) and the aim was to get the maximum number of frags. In this case, the winner managed to get 63 frags: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Sunny Kumar Aditya (XI-K)    I hope that the Class X Domain Square on Monday will be as successful. Now that I think back, we had almost cancelled today's event this morning because of the profusion of viruses, but we fought back the viruses (quite literally) and prevailed victorious.   Thanks to Souvik Das Gupta, Maanick Nangia, Siddarth Nangia for help in organizing the event,  --Karan  PS: Without critics like Souvik who ask for perfection, we can never improve. Perhaps Souvik's eternal expression of "the sky is falling down - do something!!" just might prove to be useful.

       This is Karan posting in place of Mukul. We have decided on  Tuesday, 3rd of August  (so that you don't have to miss stayback classes) starting from  1.30pm . Currently we have only a handful people who have said they're interested in learning PHP, so eGurucool Lab should be the perfect place to have it.  Please post comments regarding any queries and be quick so that we might be able to make appropriate changes. Also, those who're interested, please tell us so in the comments, so we know how many people to expect.  --Karan

       The test took place smoothly without any serious system problems. But to be honest, we expected them to do much better. The paper was simple but they made it look difficult, even though the time limit was extended to 2 hrs from 90 mins. Only three people had some clue about the paper. The rest..?? Infact one or two walked out of the test saying that they could figure out nothing. Fine now lets come to the result:     Nikhil Agarwal (XI-H)  : He came first. Had extremely clear logic and solved two questions. Also knows web designing and flash animation. He has been selected.   Swati (XI-I)  : She also has been selected. She managed to figure out the logic of crypting question and almost made the program.   Niharika Mittal (XI-L)  : She almost managed to figure the logic behind Aurojit Panda's question.    Well you can also attempt the paper. You can download it  urlLink here . Do post your comment on the difficulty level of the paper. In case you manage to crack any of it, send it to us by e-mail at  urlLink souvikdg@gmail.com  Please do not post the solution as a comment due to two important reasons. Firstly, because the comment becomes too long and secondly, because some people have been given this paper to try at home.   Schedule for programming test of class VIII-IX has not been finalised. It shall   be posted on logexun whenever it is ready.

       This is quite a simple problem primarily for the newcomers into Exun's programming team (basically for class VIII or below). Vampire numbers are four digit numbers in which the two numbers multiplied are in the product - for example, 15 x 93 = 1395. Write a program, as short as possible, that finds every vampire number.   -Abhijit

       The event for Class IX was an absolute nightmare. Only 5 machines out of 20 were functional because the rest had been devastated by viruses, and kept shutting down spontaneously. I have no idea how we dealt with the 30 or so kids there.  Results anyway: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Shankhayan Dutta (IX-K)   In the wake of virus epidemics, the Class XII event has been moved from Wednesday the 28th to  Wednesday the 4th of August .  --Karan

       A few basic and even advanced (for the well versed) lessons in my mother tongue, PHP.  I have certain obligations uptil this Wednesday, 28th July 2004. From then onwards, I am more or less 'free for academic oppurtunities'.  The time and venue can be decided. Most probably school seems the best fit, you know something like after school, or Barista also works out. Depending on the audience ofcourse.  Preferable if students can bring laptops. Hmm.. I guess this is asking too much.  Anyway, post comments to this post for any more information.  &nbsp;

       No, we didn’t win anything because for winning, there’s this important clause that one must participate in the event, and we missed out on that little clause.  When we reached St. Xavier’s School after a 90-minute drive (and a lot of direction-asking on part of Mr. Goswami), we were told by their teachers that we cannot participate as we did not send our registration by Fax. We knew of this, and hence, two days earlier Hema Jain Ma’am had called up their Head of Operations and informed him of the situation. He had told her that on-the-spot registrations were allowed and that we need not send the form now. However, their teachers there did not care to listen. I called up Hema Ma’am and explained to her what was going on around here; since all their teachers had scurried inside, we got their President to talk to her on the phone.  This person was extremely rude to her on the phone and denied that their members gave any such information to her (outright lying), telling her that she must have misunderstood and that it’s not really his problem.   There was no longer any reason to stay there and talk to these people. I have never seen a school so insolently and disrespectfully treat a guest school, not to mention their teacher. They certainly haven’t heard the “ Mehman Bhagwan ” saying. I would like to request our Principal to ban their school from participating in not only all Exun events this year, but also all DPS events in general (and if Mukesh Sir permits, I’ll write her a letter myself).  I would also like to make a final note that at least three people, namely Sanchit Bhatia, Arjun Agarwala and Shrinjan Khosla had sat and prepared hard for this competition and it was very painful to disappoint them in such a way.

       Is your pocket money not able to keep up with your expenditure? Now here's an idea to utilize your brains for a 'good cause'.  During the summer vacations I got to know about a site acting as an interface between programmers and buyers from around the world. Buyers (reffered to as webmasters on the site) post their projects on this site and programmers (like me) get paid for what we like to do best.  On my first project, I got $90 for a couple of days work. The amount (though quite a sum for me) was very small according to the webmaster I worked with!  The payment method was also very convenient. The site (namely Scriptlance) charged $2 for sending the cheque to my home and $5 as a commission. The commision was not a problem as the webmaster paid it for me!  My project was related to Flash Animation. But there are various other categories of projects that are present such as WebSite Designing, Flash Animation, PHP, Data Entry, Search Engine Optimisation, Content Writing etc. Webmasters post their projects on the site and lots of programmers bid on the project. Then the webmaster chooses the programer he thinks is the best and pays him to do the job.  Winning of the bid is a very important and not so easy&nbsp;task and having your own site is a great advantage (as I found to my expense).  Now to get more details and to start earning straight away all you have to do is to sign up (free)with Scriptlance by following the link given below :&nbsp;    urlLink www.scriptlance.com    The biggest reason for getting quite a good sum for small projects is that most webmasters are of US origin and they count there money in dollars. Even if we get a cool Rs 5000, they see it as just $100!  I don't know how many of you know about freelancing, but I hope that those who don't, don't think that I am joking.   Hoping freelancing won't reduce the involvement of Exun members with the club,   -Abhijit

The best ones will be selected as senior (from class XI) and junior (from class VIII-IX) programmers in Exun. The test will be held after school hours during stay-back. Existing programmers in classes VIII, IX and XI are requested to announce about the test in all the sections. The names of interested candidiates along with their class, section and email address should be given to any one of the following:-  Prateek Rungta (XII-H) Nisheeth Sharma (XII-H) Souvik Das Gupta (XII-I) The details of candidates may also be posted as a comment to this message.

       Can we have an online chatroom exclusively for exun members? It will be great if we could manage that. Exun members online can interact and share ideas with eachother even during holidays. Also online meetings can be conducted. MSN etc. cannot serve this purpose as&nbsp;every one then needs to know eachother's id, include them,allow them....etc.etc.etc. No complications at all, just login and if there are members online start chatting immediately. We can have username and password to control entry into the chatroom. Do comment on this idea, folks.

       Exun has only been taking print outs in school. Don't you people think that we can organize competitions in school. The quizzing club and the debating&nbsp;society have already organized many and I think its time for the computer club to do something. Ofcourse we have the d 2  coming up, but it is not exactly an inter section competition. We have good quizzers, web designers,&nbsp;programmers etc. and can easily make quality questions. So why not hold an intersection event?

I will therefore, in my  attempt to to comply to the request, sign off as Nisheeth everytime I post anything. Blogger will however, still say that the post was " posted by Azgez".

I would like to share an idea&nbsp;in my very first post. Why dont we try to increase the&nbsp;number of members&nbsp;in Exun? After all there is no shortage of talent in&nbsp;our school. We can ask the all the teachers of computer department to give the names of good and talented students to us. We can then hold tests&nbsp;and judge them. The best of the lot can be a member of Exun. Howzzat!!

       Hey Guys  Domain Square 2004 will take place next week. As this will be an all-classes event, we need the cooperation of more Exun members. Those who work also get to play, and those who don't will get left out, so sad.  Anyway, we need Representatives for Classes VIII, X, XI and XII. The position of Representative for Class IX has already been filled. In addition, we will have two Representatives for Class VIII instead of one because they will also be incharge of Classes VI and VII.  The job of the Representatives is quite simple. We have posters, and they have to make sure that the Domain Square announcement is made in each section of their respective class.  Domain Square will take place over 6 days starting on Wednesday, 21 st  of July and ending Monday, 2 nd  of August. There will only be one round for each class. Each class from VI to XII will have its individual competition on one day each between 21 July and 2 August. There will be  one  winner from each Class. We will take between 16 and 20 people from each Class on a first come first serve basis.  Announcements will start tomorrow and posters will be posted. The Domain Square website is operational at   urlLink www.exunclan.com/d2  .  After each day of Gaming, Domain Square Reps will have their own LAN gaming party till 3:30 PM (time when buses leave). So hurry up and join as a Rep by posting your name in the comments. Discretion of choosing members for D[2] lies with me.  --Karan

       There is a two-event competition on 29th July.  It has  Web Designing  (Classes 6 to 9) and  Movie Making  (Classes 10 to 12). The Movie Making is weird, and I don't know how it works, but for Web Designing, you need to make a picture based on one of the topics they've given beforehand and bring it on a CD.   Topics for Web Designing    Supermarket  Aeronautics  Fashion Designing  News  Travel Agency    They have a website  urlLink http://www.tagoreint.com/   --Karan

       Not a revolutionary idea, but let me outline it.  I've wanted to learn ASP and PHP - web languages basically - for a long time now, but the books are hundreds of pages thick and I don't have the resolve to open and read them. Similarly, I have read books on topics that others would like to know about but do not have the patience to sit and read them for themselves.  I suggest that when a significant number of Exun members want to learn about a specific topic, they can post a plea on ln(exun) titled "Sessions@Exun:  " and ask other members who also want to learn about the same topic vote in the comments. It would also request any member who is versed in the topic to come forward.  When a knowledgable person comes forward, s/he can be asked to conduct a little class during stayback outlining the topic, giving the basics, and referring to appropriate books and reference material on the Internet. This privilege could be extended to accept non-Exun members into the Sessions who might get interested and want to join Exun.  I would, as I mentioned, like to learn ASP and PHP, and I know a person (namely Maanick) who is versed in the  subject, and I would like it if he conducted a Session on it. And, for example, I've read this book on cryptography, which is very interesting yet is highly repetitive. So I could mash it down and conduct a Session on cryptography.  Please post your comments (votes) on whether you like the idea, or whether it should be dismissed.  I, am, at your service, --Karan Exun We take printouts

       Hey!  Good to see EXUN keeping up with the latest trends on the web. The blog is a really good idea to keep in touch with people, and a very effective means of getting ideas, and information across! Kudos to EXUN.  As many of you are aware, EXUN has its own community on Orkut. Anyone who hasn't joined it can do so, and if you don't know what Orkut is, well.. (contact Karan for details).   Cheers!  -- vIkSiT

       Hello,   urlLink exunclan.com  will be going through a server transition on July 7th 2004, at 9PM IST.  In case anybody is using the current IP to connect to the website, you will require to update your records, or just be smart and use the domain name.  However, no other significant changes will be made. Karan will still be able to leave the current settings for Blogger (i.e. FTP).  An important change however is how email will be handled on the exunclan.com domain. Most exun members are entitled to getting an email address, and can request the names they would like. There is obviously a limit on how many users the system can accomodate, hopefully everybody gets atleast one address.  In an ongoing effort to make Exun members more net savvy (woah!), most of you (if not everyone) will be able to get a personal URL in case you need.  I haven't decided what it'll be, but I'm likely to attend the meeting on the 7th of July to discuss some possibilities.  Just a thought :  urlLink http://members.exunclan.com/~username   Anyhow, Cheers.

       This is your President. Listen up.  There's a competition on the aforementioned date. Here are the details.  They have four events (highly convenient):    Computer Symposium (basically, speaking on a topic)  Quiz  Gaming  Web Designing    Events are taking place starting at 9.30 am and ending at 2.30 pm. One day only, again highly convenient. My calendar tells me that 28 th  is a Wednesday.   urlLink Download the  Details of Computer Symposium  here   urlLink Download the  Details of Quiz, Gaming, Web Designing  here   urlLink Download the  Schedule  here   Since they don't have a website, I've had to scan the letter they sent us. If the files that I've posted aren't readable for some reason, leave a note in the comments, I shall clarify doubts. One highly noticeable omission from this event is that of any programming event. I shall say no more. There are more eyes on this log than I'm comfortable with.  Those who wish to participate, please leave a note in the comments (with email address).  Have a good day and best of luck with the exams, --Karan  PS: They've given a contact name and number for clarifications: Mrs. Simmi Kher Ph: 25814084 Email:  urlLink springdalespusa@vsnl.com

       Today was the big day, The Columban Open Quiz Finals. The Columban Open Quiz, this year for us , had been great. In the prelims,we came first, thanks to some computer related questions which came , which Karan had earlier asked me. In The quarters and the semis, we had the same result,1st. We had obviously shocked everyone, as no one had expected a team like ours(comprising of me, Ishaan, Aakash,Akshat), to reach the finals with a continuous winning streak.But today , disappointed befalled on us , as we couldn't even manage to get in the first three.We came fifth, ahead of Bhavya's team but behind 'DADA KI ARMY' , another DPS RKP team, which came 2nd. But I think it was quite a good experience, as I am quite young and reached so far ,and I encourage EXUN members to particiapte in this quiz as it consists of many many computer related questions, ought to come in Computer Quizzes.eg:- We were asked ' Which country's domain name is .ch' and '.pt' and what does Error 405 signify etc.

       This is not just another proposed logo. In fact I think its good not(only) because I made it, but because ..... it is appealing and exun-type. Check it out.     Now ofcourse the logo will not be in black and white. I want you to suggest the color of the logo.    Note: If you like it, comment on it. If you dont, suggest changes, I can also give you the .psd file. And if you think that you can do a better job - DO IT.

       Technologists ("computer people") like to use this word 'powerful' in peculiar ways. Compared to BASIC, C++ is more powerful and compared to a 266 MHz computer, a 2.66 GHz computer is more powerful. Today, I say: PHP is not simply powerful, PHP is Power (with a capital P that is).  Mukul used to talk about PHP a lot, how he loved programming in PHP and how it was so generally fantastic. I never really understood. After all, I said to myself, it's a programming language... what can be so great about a programming language? Today I found out. PHP is the most flexible language I have ever seen (I have not seen much, but still). 'Flexible' is just the right word, because you will find the same power in C++ as well. Of course then C++ is not used as a Server Side Scripting language, so you can't make a fair comparison. I won't explain here how it's flexible because that's what the Session@Exun was about.  Mukul was disappointed that he did not get much done, and didn't really go into the 'good stuff', but we all (me and some friends) expected this, especially because not everyone there knew C++ (which would have meant easily skipping about half the topics we went through). The small gathering was an enthusiastic one, many doubts were asked and all were answered. It could be easily seen that everyone thoroughly enjoyed the Session as a) no one wanted to leave and b) those who had to leave 20 minutes early begged to stop the class and continue it some other time.  If Mukul finds free time next week, we can arrange a second Session in which perhaps we can apply some of the power of PHP. However, if there is to be a next Session, Mukul has advised that everyone should know about PHP syntax, so that that does not have to be explained [again]. If there is another Session, information will be posted on this blog.  --Karan

       It's no secret that a lot of people have been trying to get into Exun these past few days because of an unexplained surge in publicity. We've decided that we will state in a lucid manner what we are looking for and what we are not looking for. This log entry shall get a permanent link on the sidebar so that we can easily point people to it. Let me get to the point now.  We want members in the following categories:      Senior Quizzing (Class X to XII)     Debating, Declamation & Group Discussion (Public Speaking - Class IX to XII)     Software Display (Programmers in VC++, VB  who have made some kind of software )     Junior Programming (Class VI to VIII, knowledge of QBASIC)     Senior Programming (Class X to XII) applicants   please read:  We have many good senior programmers in Exun already and quite frankly we're saturated at the moment. Our priority right now is to send the existing programmers for events and competitions. Taking new programmers at this stage will do nobody any good. You may still apply for Senior Programming but be assured that unless you're really brilliant, your chances of getting in are low.   Junior Programming  Since QBASIC is no longer taught at Class VIII level (instead Visual Basic is taught), the Programming Department of Exun is planning to conduct a Logic Test for Class VIII very soon, from which promising students will be trained in QBASIC.   Software Display  Students who have made software in Visual Basic or Visual C++ (any software with a GUI) are invited to come and show their software to us (see below). We're looking for good software that can be sent for Software Display competitions.   Senior Quizzing  The toughest amongst them all. Hop along if you think you know about computers and we'll test you (see below).    Other categories  are:      Digital Imaging     Flash Animation     Web Designing    For these three, students are expected to bring a piece (or pieces) of original work and show it to us. We can judge you then. Again, see below.   See belows  Wherever See Below has been mentioned: Exun members are present in the eGurucool Lab (F-Block) during Break time everyday. Look for the Presidents (Maanick Nangia or Karan Misra) and if you can't find them, try to locate Mr. Mukesh Kumar. You can also email at  urlLink exunclan@gmail.com  or comment on this post if you have any queries (or if I forgot to mention something).  --Karan

       Hello,  This is to let people know of an artificial intelligent bot that runs on MSN, and talks to people.  OSI (initially) meant - Online Status Indicator. I undertook the project about a week ago, when something Aurojit Panda said, sparked my interest in making this bot. It has gone beyond reporting status for people who have added OSI to their contact lists.  It now uses the ALICE engine to generate AI responses over the MSN network. Feel free to add her to your list.  The MSN id is "osibot@hotmail.com", minus the quotes ofcourse. You can enjoy OSI's benefits as soon as you add it to your contact list!  Enjoy.

       The competition took place on 2nd August 2004 and 27 people took part.  The winner, with any ado, was: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Varun Vasudevan (X-B)   Since Gursartaj has already detailed on the topic, I shall say not much. There were two Preliminary Rounds and one Final Round. A few Class X Exun Members also took part, but they weren't much good at gaming, to be honest. Hence the need for these competitions.  --Karan

       We participated in only three events out of a total of five as we neither had a participant for Group Discussion nor a software to submit for software Display. The events which we did participate in were Gaming, Web Designing and Senior Programming. Souvik could not make through the qualifiers of the Gaming event due to keyboard problems. The game was Unreal Tournament and the frag limit was just 10.  Vansh and Rasagya were declared third in the Web Designing event. Swati and myself won the Senior Programming. We did not think we could have won the programming event as the last (fourth) question we had to do was to make an analog clock with the hour, minute and seconds hand. The clock had to work i.e. show the time. Neither of us (me and Swati) had any idea about graphics in C++, but with the C++ help file we were able to make a pretty nice clock which worked! As we were the only ones who had got all the questions right, we won. I don't think there was a trophy for the overall winning school.

       Hello Fellow exunites. this is an unofficial post on Domain Square-2nd aug I do not know who the winner was. I dont even know who cleared the first round. But i have found out that we have a new computer teacher, Mr. Ankit Wadhwa. well i shall tell u how. well u see that we had the domain square competition for class 10 today and who wouldn't like to fire a few rounds? so we had this extremely irritating guy, who is also in my class, wanting to play games. He asks Ankit, the one who hath the 6600, if he can play or not and Ankit allows. We received certain complaints that somebody is playing without registering, looking into the matter we found out that it was that same person. On being interrogated he replies that he has asked the teacher. WHICH TEACHER???????? answer: Mr. Ankit Wadhwa, who was happily chatting on his phone a few minutes later. I hope Karan posts an official entry on Domain Square thank you

       Did you know that Intel EEs(Extreme Edition) are based on the Galatin core , that is,they are Xeons in the disguise of P4s. Also,they have 2mb l3 cache,512kb l2 cache , so that accounts to 2.5mb cache(we all know that intel cpus don't have much l1 cache,so that is neglible).  Amd officially announced that the prices of the amd athlon xp will be raised from 10-30% depending upon the model and the prices of the amd 64 to go down by the same , globally.

        OK, rescheduling again, this time because of dear old  urlLink TechEdge . So, we have two tentative dates now, which are  Thursday the 5th and Friday the 6th (same time : 1.30pm) . I would like comments from the people who want to attend so that we can decide on the most favourable date.  A recap for those who haven't read about  urlLink Sessions@Exun  or more specifically  urlLink PHP . The idea of Sessions@Exun was conceived so that interested people may learn a specific skill in computers from people who have already learnt that skill and are experienced in it. This helps because reading big, fat books is tedious and sometimes if the book is technical, then confusing as well. Teachers are always better than books anyway.  More specifically  PHP  ( P HP:  H ypertext  P reprocessor) is an HTML-embedded scripting language, which means that it is used for serving dynamic content on web pages, just like ASP. The only difference (usage-wise) between ASP and PHP is that ASP is a Microsoft product and needs a Windows Server to run on while PHP is Open Source and can run on any OS. And since Linux is being more widely deployed these days, it makes more sense to learn PHP if you're doing Server-Side Scripting. I am told that PHP is tougher than ASP, but since I have no knowledge of PHP (I'm counting on this Session myself), I can't say anything about that.   About  Mukul : Many people have asked me who Mukul is, so let me introduce him. Mukul is an Exun alumnus, currently studying at Iowa State University (US). He is here in Delhi for his summer break and has found time to give us an introduction to PHP, which he says is his mother tongue.  Please comment away people. We want to know who's coming and what day is more favourable - Thursday or Friday.  --Karan  PS: Any student of DPS RK Puram can attend, not just Exun members.
