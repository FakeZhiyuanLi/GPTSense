						   At times people have to stand up for themselves, to stand up for what they believe in and let whatever happens, happen. This is one of the philosophies I live by, for some the courage to live this way is hard to come by. It may be hard at first, but once the path is walked it gets easier every time.  This does not mean however that foolish actions should be performed, consequences naturally follow. No one seeks scars, at least scars of the mind. Scars of the flesh fade into memory, then become no more than a decoration to be admired. Scars of the mind weep blood for all time... forever fresh until buried in the dungeons of the mind. No mind should need a dungeon, seek not scars but the path of life you wish to walk. Consider carefully the paths, for the one which may look appealing at the entrance may be covered with pitfalls and serpeants further down the path.  Choose carefully your path.... let it not lead into a dungeon of continual hurt.

						   "Accelerate into oblivion" Bad Religion - Supersonic  Sorta describes how busy I've been today. Since I got home about 1 am last night (or should I say this morning?) I slept in till around 10-11. From there I got up and my parents informed me of the things I am responsible for whilst they leave for two days. It's nice to have some away time from them... though even when their home I still get lonely. From there I got to hang out with Adam and Josh. Very cool, learnt some some weapons technique for flying kama's and regular kama's. A kama is an miniture scythe with an handle about eight inches long and a blade about six or seven inches long. A flying kama is a kama with an leather thong on the handle to spin it around with. I learnt a technique for spinning two weapons at once, quite challenging at first but rewarding once you get the hang of it. We also talked about a fellow who is a fourth degree blackbelt in karate and trained in many other disciplines who does weapons training with an elite team of his own in Edmonton. He's on team canada and apparantly trains hard in all sorts of karate weapons such as the&nbsp;bo, sai's, nunchucku, kama, tonfa, and swords. They even have big brawls wearing super-protective armor apparantly - quite dangerous by the sounds of it.&nbsp; Sounds like something I'd be interested in. Though I'd have to get my blackbelt first and hope he'd recruit me for training... that's a bit down the road.   Besides that I got completley owned in foosball, I held my own better in air hockey though. Josh has a really awesome basement. Cool guys as well, will definatly hang out with them again. Yeah, I've still yet to manage the art of the "kick up" a fancy move to get up off the floor when your on your back. It looks quite impressive when pulled off correctly. Quite stupid if not pulled off though.  Karate class was excellent, had a large class, maybe ten people. My gei was really snappy today, the teacher took notice :) good stuff. Did lots of kata, and some bonkai. Sensei also says Karen is coming along nicely, there has been vast improvement since she started. She got to flip people her size today rather than myself.   So, all in all it was a good day. Other than the fact a mosquito&nbsp; flew directly into my right eye as I was biking full speed down a hill. I had to escort Karen home since I gave her my old bike and her mom didn't want her going home alone late at night. Apparantly 9:30 is late... so I got home at like 11, and I swallowed another mosquito as well. Now I sit here an hour later pleasantly tired and looking forward to practicing my bo kata tommorow. Hopefully I will get to hang out tommorow as well.  D

						   An enjoyable day as I predicted. Would have been much more so knowing&nbsp;Michelle had enjoyed it as such. Things are needlessy complicated at times and I feel like I'm being drawn into a world of discord. And I don't care&nbsp;I'm being drawin in either, it's funny...&nbsp;I forsee much thinking time, not the kind that draws me into oblivion though.  D  I mean what I say. Always.

						   Well, I'm still fairly pumped up today. Karate yesterday was superb, aside from the fact it wasn't as hardcore as usual due to the fact we had kids in the class it was very rewarding. I need to talk to my sensei about bo kata ichi, now that I have my own bo I want to practice at home; however, I forget the transitions between certain parts of the kata. Well, Adam and Karen and I are going to hang out on thursday, maybe Adam remebers the kata... I sure don't remember all of it. I haven't done it in three months. Adam and I were also talking about taking a class in japanese sword fighting, sounds interesting. I didn't know such a class existed in the park. I need to work on my abs more, they are getting there but it's a four pack only if anything. Maybe I should ask some guys at the gym how to go about getting a good ol' six pack. I'm actually being good at working at them. Did my crunches this morning with my legs over my ottoman as usual. Sensei neglected sit ups yesterday, a shame that. Karen actually broke a sweat yesterday, so she's getting into it. She says she is going to stick with it as well, good for her. Karen needs to land a job to pay for all it though, and possibly move out and what not.&nbsp; What else do I need to practice... I want to get pinan nidan to the point of perfection. I should be grading within a month or so, would be nice to have a belt that goes around my waist twice. I'd also like to learn pinan yondan, I'd have all five pinan's then. I really should ask my sensei if we could do a weapons class outside sometime, those are so enjoyable. I wonder if people will stay to watch next time.&nbsp; Yeah, working with the bo is very enjoyable. So far it's my favorite martial arts weapon. The tonfa don't look too exciting, ditto for nunchucku. I don't think sensei even has a kama.&nbsp;I know&nbsp;sensei&nbsp;does sword kata's, just not often. &nbsp;Sai's look interesting though, I think I might get a pair of those as a graduation present from some very good friends of my family. Hope their basement is alright after that flood the other week.  It's shaping up to be a busy day, I work for six hours then come home, shower, eat, and head out straight afterwards. I'll probably end up being out to one or two AM, but that's the best kind of day. Productive, busy, exciting and rewarding. Would be nice to be able to drive rather than walk, but that'll come soon enough. I'm really gonna try and start training outside of karate class, it doesn't go as smoothly without anyone there to correct you though. It's hard to see your mistakes without mirrors as well. The only place I have enough room is in my backyard and I dislike training there cause of the presents my dog leaves and the neighbour's kids watching. I also like to kai lots (kai means shout which&nbsp;focuses&nbsp; one's spirit) and I don't like doing that in my backyard either. Sometimes I wish I lived on an acerage still, with space and privacy. Room to train and shoot my bow. Well, that's enough for today.  D

						   When I feel down emotions zip through my head. Doubt, fear, depression. The destroyers of mankind. Though you may knock me down as many times as you will I shall rise again. For I have will, pride, perserverance and values. The will to live, the will to fight! I pride myself on this, and believe me I have will. She knows I have will.&nbsp;As the wall in my dojo says, "Fall down seven times,&nbsp;stand up eight".&nbsp; The destroyers of hope touch me no more. "Fallen angels arise from your graves, Free your spirits and unite" Hammerfall - On the Edge of Honour.  So once again I feel ready to face the world with my head held high. Diaster avoided, thank you for helping me find myself again.  D  Here we stand with the Future in our hands Through fire we'll rise to touch the sky

						   Whoever said love hurts, they were right. This is likely to be a short rant... just need my thoughts in order. Who knew sharing the words containing my beliefs could bring about such times. I live true to myself, I will walk the path of fire if need be. Not everyone is as such, some would merely walk the path of fire for the sake of walking the path. Most people don't want to be hurt, nor do I. Of course I am talking of mental pain, physical pain is but a candle held to the sun compared to mental anguish. I don't like seeing my loved ones hurt, it hurts me in turn.  D

						   Well, it is likely this rant won't be as long as my first. Venting that really helped clear my head, that and talking to My special someone. Today, today... what can I say about today? It was on the most part a good day. I am now the proud owner of a six foot bo staff made of red oak, even bought it myself despite being under eighteen. Now I can train for kobuto kata at home, for those who are interested I train in the Shito-Ryu style of karate and the bo staff happens to be my favorite weapon. Today my feet seem to have a mind of their own, my house has become confining. All this energy and enthusiasm and I have no one to share it with today. It's criminal in it's own right... "I&nbsp;have will, I am fit, how could it have come to this?" Iron Maiden - The Mercenary. Still, partly my fault for not clearly making plans in advance. You know it's creepy how horiscopes can be perfectly right, I normally don't buy into this sort of thing but take a look at this.   Libra July 25   Your dear ones will be startled at what tumbles from between your lips. Should you stop? Not unless a secret you swore to hold to your grave is involved.   Libra July 26   If you're wondering where your people-pleasing, cooperative personality went -- well, wonder no longer. It's just your turn to be assertive. Enjoy it. You know you've been craving it.   Well the 25th was yesterday, and indeed... I felt like a freaking poet all day, could hardly stop talking. As for the 26th, yes I am feeling rather assertive and it's been working out for me. In relation to that I have been cleared by my folks to take driving lessons and for insurance. Driving will bring freedom, I can't wait to spread my wings. I have been waiting to see a friend of mine in Edmonton for over a month now and I still haven't been able to get a ride. Besides that I will now be able to get around better in the late hours (even if I have to sneak through a window or two). So, all in all besides a setback in plans tonight it's been a good day.   What has been on the forefront of my thoughts today... love, hate, fate. Firstly, what is it to be in love? I know no one can exactly describe what it feels like to be in love. To care deeply for another? Just to think of that special someone and a smile touches your lips? Hmmmm *ponder*. As for hate, the opposite of love. I can't honestly say I hate many people. It's not a feeling I care for so I don't dwell on it. Fate... is there such a thing as fate? I believe everyone crafts their own destinies through the choices they make in life. Choices, decisions, the mark of how one chooses to live. Every choice leads down another path, that path inevitably leads down to another choice. There are times when guidance is an important part of decision making as well. One could easy be lost in the woods without a guide, yes? I feel in confident my decisions have been the best ones possible to make at any given moment. As I said earlier I live without regrets, I wouldn't change a thing.  D

						   Let whatever gods there may be smile on this post, the first of many no doubt. This is blog is simply going to be an outlet for the thoughts, feelings and desires that I need to express. Let it be known I am by no means am I touchy feely like this in real life, I just a lot going on and now that highschool has ended clicks that have existed for nigh forever fade away and brand few ones come into being. On that note, my best wishes to my best friend Mike who is currently undergoing basic training in St. John's; so that he might be an officer in the Canadian military one day. Yes, clicks do fade away, some people fade out of scene, falling out of touch - and trust me I have tried to make sure that wouldn't happen. Despite my best efforts it has happened.&nbsp;Other's like myself push forward, forming new clicks and being accepted into already formed ones. Now I find new&nbsp;friends on the forefront of my thoughts whilst others drift further away on the winds of time. Call me melodramatic if you must; however,&nbsp;this is how I sound in my head right now. It is not often one is given a glimpse into the mind of another, a gift to those who seek it.&nbsp;To&nbsp;whoever may end up reading this I hope you appreciate this fact. It is funny what you think about when you have spare time. This summer has been so busy with "love, life and duty" as I am so fond of saying when asked what I have done with my summer. Thoughts such as these have been the product of such spare time... I sound like an old man *laugh*; it is good to be young. It is often said the young are full of hopes and dreams. I can only I live my life filled with hopes and dreams such as I have now. I can only attempt to live every day as if it is my last, without regret, hesitation and with an open mind and heart. This has led to some major changes in the past few years of my life and you know what? I wouldn't do a single thing differently. How many people can honestly say that? I count myself among one of the lucky few.  This signals the end of my first rant. It felt quite rewarding I must say.   D

						    urlLink Iron Maiden - Dream of Mirrors  Click for lyrics. Good song, reflects my mood well today.  Well, I'm not so ticked off today. Some RnR and junk food does that for me. Read for a while, had a good sleep in, walked for a few hours and had some photo's developed.  A lot turned out well, if I can be bothered to scan some I might post them here. Good times there. I resolve to take more pictures from now on, now that we have a digital camera. There's like none of me from the past five years.  My legs seem to  be on the path to recovery, I must attempt to keep myself from overstretching them at karate tonight.  Wouldn't kill people to me more friendly, these past few days it seems the majority of people have got something stuck up their arse and it's grating on my nerves. I should like to see Danielle sometime soon, Karen been talking about it and I haven't seen her and Josh since school. Looking forward to hanging out tommorow, dreading another eight hour shift on saturday. Oh well, that's life. All I can do is face it headon.

						   I am annoyed... and pissed too. Hardly a soul has been social to me today, and an old guy spit in my eye at work. Though he was giving me the weather rather than the news. Hardly anyone wants to talk, they say hi, some chit chat with no substance and off about their adgenda's. Cashiers, customers, friends and family alike. Though I must admit my parents have an actual conversation with me about three times a year.  Not a very fun day, got called in to work four hours early, so I did an eight hour day. Every muscle below my pelvis is sore as hell as well, due to over stretching at karate... just when I was thinking I could compete with yoga people like Danielle. So, pushing carts for the odd five hours I had to do them... not fun, though do you notice how pain fades away when you stop caring? Though now that I think about it I don't feel pain when I got an adrenline rush either. Pain... is often just a matter of acceptance, if you accept something is going to hurt, don't care, it doesn't hurt as much. I remember that from when I fractured my leg and arm.  So to sum things up, not a good day. I am largely ignored by everyone around me, other than some old dude who spits at people whilst he talks. My legs hurt.

						   I haven't had the time to post in a few days. Been fairly busy, I seem to have been accepted into a new click. Very cool guys, lots in common with a bunch including University courses and love for martial arts and just having fun. Had some crazy misadventures, and practiced our clown car routine with a jeep.  Played some "night soccer" got me in some trouble with my folks, but whatever, slid right off my back like water. Partied last night, was great. Oh, also sold my old compound to Josh, yay! Today, did some driving - was all good with instructor and my father but my mother is a biatch to drive with. She needs tranquilizers I swear.  On the up side I think I'm safely over breaking up, yay! So, time to set off after that rising sun. Meeting girls is hard though, least while not in school.  All I feel like saying for now, if you want more information please contact the Jester.

						   Starting to get adjusted to the single life. Even though I grieved weeks before I became single there is still a lot to get used to, a lot of things I miss. michelle broke it off with Kyle, for that I am proud of her, it wasn't an easy thing for her to do. At least she has someone to comfort her. Moving on takes time... I can only wonder if we'll remain friends. I certaintly hope so, michelle is my best friend, that's a lot to loose. She alone knows things about me no other soul on this world has ever heard.  There shall be others, I can only hope... that statement doesn't bring much comfort right now. I can only wait until I am ready to chase that rising sun once more.

						   Foo Fighters - Kung Fu Fighting, I happen to be listening to this right now and it has me in a good enough mood to be the title of today's blogg. Today went fairly well, I managed to see Aliens verus Predators with David, his bro and his bro's possy. It wasn't that scary to my discontent. The focus ended up being more on the use of highly advanced graphics rather than the suspsense of the ol' movies. The lack of suspense was due to the fact it was the predators verus the aliens rather than the puny human verus aliens, so they could be more cocky and insert some amusing scenes and just crazy battle scenes.  Besides the movie I went for another in car driving lesson today, I'm improving. This is good. Josh has agreed to buy my old left handed bow, so I'm in a good mood about that. I'm letting it go real cheap just 'cause I'm a nice guy and want it put to good use. I haven't used the bleedin thing in years, I prefer my longbow over that over-rated hunk of metal they call a compound.  Let's see, I've agreed to help michelle with a terrarium. She's taking over Kyle's neglected gecko. Kyle is also back from camp today, I know michelle has not been exactly looking forward to his return. Sticky situation which seems to only become more sticky as time goes on.

						   Zanshin - Lit. "remaining mind/heart." Even after a Karate technique has been completed, one should remain in a balanced and aware state. Zanshin thus connotes "following through" in a technique, as well as preservation of one's awareness so that one is prepared to respond to additional attacks.  Had an excellent karate class today. Was an excellent class with a focus on goju kata's. I picked up one new kata, no chance on Earth I could spell it correctly though. One of the class members from another dojo called me and Adam "strong" that amuses me... though it was in reference to our current belt standing. Judging from what sensei said I should be up for a grading soon, complimented me on my technique, hinted at it, said pinan shodan was a strong kata for myself - no clue when that came about. Though I did ace it that one time I was living in the dream during class... wish I could do that more often.  As for the title of this blogg, Zanshin (had to look this up btw) follow through and the maintaining of awareness. Awareness is important to be preserved, discrations can make you miss the obvious. Later on, you can look back and think how blind you were. I also should keep aware now that I'm living the single life, I'm not great at reading people I don't know. I am however good at making friends, so I'm gonna have to get on that. So many of my old friends have gone down paths that take them from mine, or drifted away. I can only look forward to when our paths cross again. In the mean time I can only hope I don't spend too much time alone before univeristy... I really have become a lot more social, being alone now depresses me unless I apply myself to something worth while. What is more important in life than friends, love and family eh?

						   It's been a while since I've posted... let's see... excuse, excuse... Got no goo ones offhand I'd say. Not been busy this week, losta alone time, can't keep going on about the same ol' thoughts forever I suppose. Let's see, just back from my lame driver's ed, I passed the written - barely... made some stupid answers. Things cooling down between me and michelle it seems, it's mutual though. Prolly for the best cause I had some pretty deep feelings... always end up hurt, angry, or depressed, sometimes all three. Then got tired of feeling that way, though I still care. It is depressing to think that michelle didn't feel the same way... sure, you said you cared for me, but not the same. Though it's nice we're still close.  I look forward to university, plently of new friends and parties around the corner. I also look forward to my upcoming grading at karate. Well... don't know exactly what to say... mostly I know the people reading this, and they would have heard what I wanted to say too them. Except I want to go clubbing with Mike when he comes back from basic... how the hell I will manage to be doing that considering I'm not 18 for another two months.

						   Well, what can I say... My thoughts roam far and wide today, I have thought about the big questions the small questons. Life, death, what to do tommorow, an hour from now, right now. If anyone has got anything on those big questions, drop me a line. As for now, I have decided to write this blogg. I got to talk to Mike again today, miss the guy lots. It also makes me miss David, who seems to have been drifting away. The ol' click parts ways for now, but shall be reunited when Mike comes home on leave. Don't wait up for me come the 28th.  Lonelyness creeps in on me, I can only hope to spend some time with my friends soon. There seems to be nothing but work and solitude lately. There is change on the horizon though, soon summer shall end. Painful to say, but it shall and I shall be attending University. I can only hope it is a equal or better experience than highschool was. New friends, teachers, courses... and of course partying! Once I turn 18 anyways.  Changes are on the horizon, good or bad, happy or sad. All matters not as long as I make them and feel no regret.

						   Well today was fun filled and enjoyable. To lay out my basic schedule first, get up at eight, work till two. Then, a *in car* driving lesson from four till six. Very fun. Then, karate from seven till nine. That makes for a full day. Work... well what can I say about work... Oh I know... Manure SMELLS. Don't ask.  Driving was actually fun, and I seem to be catching on really fast. I got to do just about everything but the traffic circle. Went on the highway, all around, parrallel parking. The whole deal. They need to make those darned Japanese cars bigger though.  Karate was awesome! Me and a few other people got to do weapons in the backyard, we went through the bo staff. That was quite fun, and I got to demonstrate pinan shodan for the class. I nailed that kata, especially at the end. Sensei was actually quite impressed with my explosions of movement, just need to work on the first couple moves and I've got a tournament kata. I managed to achieve that feeling of being in a dream I talked about yesterday for the period of that kata. Superb, wish I could get it like that all the time.  Petal to the Metal is an song from the soundtrack to the Italian Job, it is quite awesome, I reccomend listening to it sometime. Soon as I get my drivers, this is gonna be blaring on the speakers most likely. That, along with a buncha Iron Maiden and Hammerfall.  Tommorow looks promising for doing stuff, I work five till ten and for once have no other plans.  That seems to bring a close to my blogg for today, no thoughts have been weighing me down, for I have been flying free all day.  D

						   Had some interesting dreams the other night. It was one of the rare occasions where I could remember them. The first one... well don't you wish you know what went through my head... heh heh.. In the second one I was an karate black belt teaching my own class in my own dojo. Was pretty cool, my kicks were superb... and I got to play with weapons.  Have you ever felt you were living in a dream? Everything is rather surreal, you feel unconstrained by normal limitations. You act without hesitation, live in the moment. Personal saftey drifts out of thought and you act on impluses. I don't feel this way often, but when I do it is quite the experience. Though, I have to admit I've heard of this way of expression before, so the idea is by no means orginal. Normally when one would wake from the dream of their lives, they would die. For me however that is merely the end of the feeling of involunerability and reality comes crashing back down. Just for reference here, no I do not do drugs, and 99.89% of the time I'm completely sober. It would be sweet to be in this state of mind for a karate class... I assure you, some ass would be kicked.  Let's see now for my actual day... For the most part it was a bit of a let down. I did get to hang out with Josh, Adam and Karen. Just got pushed back due to conflicting schedules and Adam getting hopelessly lost and delayed by stopping trains. So, was cut short.. didn't learn the kick up technique; however, I got pretty good at foosball and listened to some cool music. Driving class was boring... as per my expectations I doodled for 3.75 hrs on a hard plastic chair till I couldn't feel my behind. Yea, and got plans for a get together with michelle - shot down. Though I understand and respect the reasoning. Still, don't leave Me out in the cold too long.  D

						   Sooooo tired... done soooo much crap I didn't want too.... Did a 6.5 hr shift at work, then had a 3 hr respite and then I got to go to a 3.75 hr long driving class. That class is boring beyond belief. The only upside to it is Casey is in the class, and I know him so I got someone to talk too. I look forward to driving though... just not the classes. I think number one should be shot in his plastic dummy face... put that shrill voice to rest.  Tommorow is my day of rest this week. I know not exactly what I shall do with it, likely hang out with friends, then end back in that horrible class once more. Thursday I work 10 till 2 then spend the evening in karate. My first spare evening should be Friday or Saturday... I wanna break loose and have some fun then.  Least all this busyness is keeping my mind and body occupied. Downside, this busyness is making my mind and body tired and sore. Well, only my feet at sore, but I'm tired. I think all this grocery lifting has done quite a bit for my upper body. It's like a gym - but I get paid to work out, how awesome is that! Course, it could be due to Karate and the past few weeks of intense conditioning I have been doing at home. No conditioning today though... too tired. Too tired. Of course one thing that perks me up... food! Some of that and I can feel the energy flowing through my body.  I'm gonna forage the cupboards for a snack. Peace out.  D

						   Well, it looks like it's going to be a busy week. The only days I'm not working this week are Sunday and Wednesday. In addition to that driving lessons and karate are also gonna take up large portions of time. Was also considering taking kung fu as well. Being kept busy is a good thing though, takes your mind out of dark corners and makes the body strong.  The desire to train is strong in me as of late... spent over an hour after midnight doing nothing but conditioning, stretching, practicing. Not enough room in my bedroom for kata though, barely enough room to step and kick.  Just for note, I don't profess to be perfect. I am human, consequently I am flawed, subject to mistakes like any other mortal. Most of what I post on this blogg are on My thoughts, My ethics, My way of life and how I view the world. I am not a perfect person; however, I shall always strive to live my life to the fullest.

						   Whatever can go wrong, will... It's been proven time and time again. I think that Kyle guy should have to wear a bell, I can almost time my watch by him showing up at the wrong moment. My patience is far from infinite and these days it seems to be wearing thin. Life is far too complicated... I shall have to consider how to simplify it for myself.  That's it for today, nice and short. My bed beckons to me with open arms... I go into nights deep embrace.
