      My first question is...why would anyone not pick emeka okafor first?  I think this pick will go down as sam bowie over micheal jordan...aka the worst pick ever.  Taking a high schooler over a proven collegiate athlete just boggles my mind but oh well its not like i'm an nba GM or anything.  Ok enough of that bs.   Today should be a fun filled day.  wake up at 1, post a blog, shower, pay bills and go to work until 11 woohoo i can hardly wait.  Everyone else out there have fun today..I know i won't :)

      Well seems it has been like 3 years since my last blog I thought i would just throw one out there for you all!&nbsp; I've been doing a lot of soul searching lately and it seems i have come to the conclusion that i am most like the character Meatwad off of the show Aqua Teens Hunger Force (#1 in the hood G).&nbsp; This soul searching of course involved only 2 online quizzes, man am I deep!&nbsp; Anyway enough of this nonsense,&nbsp; Here I sit alone on a Saturday night because i have decided that i really wouldn't care if i never went to a bar again in my life.&nbsp; Of course this might reduce my chance of interaction with the human race but hey would anyone really miss me that much :)&nbsp; Aight thought i would just throw this blogger out there for you all hope you all enjoy it immensly!&nbsp; To end this blog i would like to throw some Meatwad quotes out there for you all....BLING! &nbsp; "I require a popsicle every 15 min you obviously did not read my memo!" &nbsp; "Everybody hates me because they die or get hurt. " &nbsp; "Alright spaghetti!&nbsp; Now that's italian!" &nbsp; "This noodles black..... and its hooked up to the tv set."

      So i worked at hudsons today for the first time in like a month.  And suprisingly i actually had fun i forgot how much i actually like it there compared to timbercreek its bling  blinging!  Anyway i thought i would just throw that out there.  Especially since my last post was like 6 days ago.  Ok so this might not make a lot of sense seems i am a little wasted.   But hey who can't beat the dollar drafts of labatts at upfront that was key.  Ok but thats all i want to say and i want to give  a shout out to all my homeys at the JABA the House.  Ok bye.
