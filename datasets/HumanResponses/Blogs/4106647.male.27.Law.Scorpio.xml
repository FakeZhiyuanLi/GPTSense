            urlLink     D espite having had a bit of a nasty day with an aching sinus, I'm still really looking forward to the visit Agnieszka and I are to make to Inverness tomorrow. I know the place quite well, having spent many hours there contemplating my feet while my parents looked at every piece of clothing they didn't want to buy in Marks and Spencers. We're going to get an early train and then a little bus trip to go monster hunting. I know it's unlikely we'll see anything big, scary and ugly in the water (Bette Midler is off filming something right now), but you never know. Should we see the monster, I'll post it's mug-shot on here along with a DNA sample and I'll name it Monstruousugliusmiddlerus.   &nbsp;    E ven if we do take a detour to Loch Ness, a day should be enough to see Inverness... as the most exciting thing about the city is the football team ( Inverness Caledonian Thistle ) who actually play their home games in Aberdeen this season. I just hope I don't get a cold... I seem to be allergic to Inverness as every time I spend any time there, I get a cold - and that wouldn't do as on Sunday we're off to see  Inver n ess Caled o nian Thi s tle  v  Celtic ! I know ICT have beaten them often in the cup, let's just hope they can do the same in their first league encounter. It'd do wonders for both ICT and Rangers if they could. Even a draw would be excellent. Anyway, this first season is more about staying up, so about 30points are needed, they already have 3 from 2 games, so it's looking OK.   &nbsp;    I'm off now to hunt monsters!      &nbsp;    Morris

          Agnieszka is here, at last, and we are having a wonderful time together. The best bits aren't the outings or the unusual things we do, but the ordinary things we share, such as cooking, watching a movie, tidying books and so on. We had a rather good day today, a nice little walk to the beach under a rather nice  blue  Aberdonian sky.   urlLink   I think I've done Agnieszka a disservice though, I made her eat real pizza, and she wanted more today; never again is she likely to want the Polish imitation... the Polish pizza is on a spongey base, then everything piled on top with the cheese holding it in place and KETCHUP squirted on the top instead of a good tomato sauce between the base and the topping!  Anyway, we're off to Stonehaven for the day tomorrow to see Dunottar Castle (where Mel Gibson's Hamlet was filmed) - there will undoubtedly be a few photos from that on my website shortly. Let's hope the weather stays nice for us.  One final note, that Olympic opening ceremony was quite spectacular, but I still prefer the Barcelona one with the archer lighting the flame. ;-)    Morris

          Although I am about to enter enemy territory, I feel elated about my trip to London tomorrow. Finally, after months apart, Agnieszka and I shall be reunited. With that prospect, even London is an enticing prospect.  We shall, undoubtedly, see some sights together after her arrival in the early afternoon; however, I intend to make a little pilgrimage of my own in the morning to the location of one 221B Baker Street, and the Sherlock Holmes museum. I've long been a fan of the great detective and embarked upon a study of Conan Doyle's works while in France, however various things lead from one to another and I returned to Aberdeen before I could complete anything worthwhile.  The travelling, though, still fills me with dread. 12h in a shaky, slow old bus from Aberdeen to London. I just pray I won't be sat beside either a kid or someone who smells. Anyway, I shouldn't grumble as Agnieszka has a much longer bus ride from Krosno in Poland before she reaches here. At least the trip back up should be easier, Agnieszka shall be there to distract me (and I've a feeling she'll succeed).  Anyway, it's about time we installed a TGV in this country, the same distance, by train, in France would be done in just 3h! Or maybe we should just build a tunnel from Scotland to the continent? I know it's a long way, but many Scots (and other Europeans) would appreciate not having to pass by England.  Morris

          OK, first real posting...  What on Earth is GW up to in the White-House? I don't even mean his antics, more precisely, why is he there?  He lost the election. He's being a bit of a moron, but yet the US could still re-elect the man. Unfathomable. Make sure you go and see Farenheit 9/11. There hasn't better political film since my own El Chupacabras ( urlLink http://members.lycos.co.uk/elchupacabras/ ) You can go along and have a look at it. Note that Michael Moore chose to end his film with the same clip I use in this one.  Anyways, enough ranting, I've a quiche to eat.

       I was born in Stornoway on 26th October 1976, in the hospital which was then opposite my parents's house. I am an only child and grew up in Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. I went to primary school at Sandwickhill school, where my mother was head-teacher. I went to secondary school at the Nicholson Institute, within walking distance of home, where my father was a teacher for my first two years (he then went to work for the council's education department).  I had various friends and acquaintances, various interests and hobbies as a child. I belonged to 3 separate Scout troups and the local chess club. I enjoyed playing with Lego, reading comics, playing with my computer, reading about science and history and much more. I wasn't very sporty, as I'd had a few illnesses, at the time I didn't really mind, but today I regret not forcing myself to be more active to fight the illness and be fitter as an adult. No one would claim I'd be a World class athlete, but I'd probably be happier with my health. - But I do claim the World title as champion 307m runner, as no one else on the planet does that distance, I must be the champ regardles of time ;-)  University came as a relief and a fissure. The island had seemed like a prison, and Aberdeen was very liberating. I have to admit my studies suffered from my freedom. I didn't go drinking or partying or anything daft, I just lost the discipline which had accompanied my schooling. But I did eventually graduate with an LLB in Scots Law and French.  I did have 4 years in France in between times, but apart from saying I returned with a great love of French culture and society, I won't mention that time much.  After graduating, I started to work for the Inland Revenue (government tax collectors) in Aberdeen. I have only just finished working for them and have recently started working for a firm of Sheriff Officers in Aberdeen.  Currently, I am in a fantastic relationship with Agnieszka. We met on the internet, both looking for pen-friends. We have decided to get married, but it won't be until a while after she moves in with me (about a year), which will be at the end of next summer. I went to Poland to meet her family this February, we had a wonderful time.  Here we are now, with everything more or less up to date. More about my past probably come out in asides in the main bit of the diary as things progress...  Morris

      Hello everyone! This is my first posting to my blog. It's kind of a test, I've no idea if I'll keep it up or not, but why not? Anyway, I've not really anything to say for the moment except that I'm really excited as my girlfriend's about to come over for a month from Poland. Why not go and have a look at my web scrap-book, which is on-line at:  urlLink http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/maciver/photos/index.htm   See you soon!  Morris
