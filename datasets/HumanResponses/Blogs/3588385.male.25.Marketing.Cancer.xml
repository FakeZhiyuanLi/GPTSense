      Today was officially "Boss/Client PowerTrip Day". It seemed around every corner, someone wanted to dot my "I" or cross my "T". At one point I just had to laugh out loud.   I'm ready to go home, lay around in just a pair of shorts and feel the summer breeze through my window. Awww. Summer.

      Today I had my first woman cab driver. Odd, I've been taking cabs for the past two months since surgery---and she's the first. I have to admit she was a much better driver than her male counterparts. And the conversation was much better--I think because she knew English.   My weekend was pretty good. I'm starting to read "The Five People You Meet in Heaven" by Mitch Albom. I couldn't put it down this weekend. The main point of the book so far is that in life we don't have all the answers--but after you pass, you meet 5 people who were in your life and they explain all the unanswered questions. Bizarre but at the same time really a comforting thought.  Last night I laid around and watched Fear Factor. It was the twin's episode and was fun....but they didn't have to eat anything disgusting. Sigh.  Everything else is gong well. Work if fine, staying really busy with these events happening in Phoenix, Dallas, Orlanda and Baltimore. Everyday there is something new to "market".'  Therapy was great today...I reached 122 degree flexion. My good leg is only at 118. But I still have a lot more work ahead, as she was pushing on my leg to get to that high of a degree. About 105-110 on my own. All in due time....

      2 hours and counting....Today has been a long day. We had a town hall meeting at work, so that took up most of my day and now I'm scrambling to get work down so I won't see it on Friday. It's been raining off-and-on all day here in Chicago...I got soaked waiting for a cab this morning. When it rains here, everyone jumps in a cab...very hard to find one actually.   Today in physical therapy, Mellissa did a re-evaluation of my progress to give to my doctors. She said she has seen "huge" progress in the last two weeks. It's just funny that's just when she took over for Maria in the office. I'm now at 105 degrees flex naturally and 117 degrees pushed. My "good" leg is only at 118 so I'm on my way to a great recovery.  I feel like those kids in high school or college, where you are just so ready to start over and get on to something else. I can't wait to get off the crutches soon and get the new apartment I signed the lease on. In a way it's a regrowth and chance to live life to it's fullest. Right now I just feel like I have on some training wheels and can't fully bust out and enjoy life yet. Very eager to say the least.

      Have you ever had one of those days where it seems like it's never going to end? Yeah, me to...and that day is today! I've only been here a few hours and it seems like forever.   My cube-mate came in late today and was how shall we say---Hungover! It's been the only thing that has made me smile all day. She's having trouble reading, feels like she's going to pass out and can't focus. The joys of drinking till 3 a.m. I have a feeling her day is going to feel much longer than mine! :)  I had Funyuns, M&Ms and a Pepsi for lunch---not so healthy. But I'm trying to gain the weight I lost since surgery. Everyone in my office jokes that I beat cancer but am going to die of a heart attack. I just feel so small right now. I plan on getting in the gym soon after I get off my crutches---21 days and counting!

      A few months ago I was diagnosed with bone cancer and recently underwent some major surgery that pretty much saved my life and quality of living. Don't worry though---it wasn't some horrible disfiguring ordeal. :)   However it did open doors of self-discovery that have allowed me to emerge with a deeper level of comprehension about myself and others. It's changed my priorities and helped me redefine what is important to me.   I truly believe that if I was not diagnosed with cancer, I would not have discovered my new, and now cherished, friends and family. We often rush through life not realizing what is ultimately important.I find life very exciting, meaningful, full of hope and funny.   I guess that is why I'm starting this online journal--mostly a way to stay in contact with friends and family. I plan to just write down random thoughts and ideas as they come to me. Some days I'll be serious---other days---not so much. Feel free to post a comment, share your thoughts and laugh at life with me. -Bri
