       So, I have to write something about this cos of how I just obsess about it on a regular basis.  If I lose my girlfriend, which I am actually feeling less concerned about to day, I lose the sex.  But it's not just the sex...which is honestly the best sex I've ever had...it's also this amazing dynamic.  I have never met anyone who is such a perfect compliment to who I am as a sexual being.  I mean, it's fucking amazing.  And she's never met anyone who compliments her so well either...you know?  Like, every fantasy...every desire...every deep dark secret dream of any sort of sexual experience that I've ever had...she's right there with me.  We haven't even come close to expereiencing the stuff that we've discussed.  We've only just begun.  And now I'm looking at the possiblity of starting over...sheesh.  That just sucks.  I don't want to start over.  I want to continue on this path of discovery that we've found together.  It's so unbelievably cool that I'm afraid there is not another person in the world who will be able to compliment my tastes so well on so many levels and be as willing to explore.  I know I'm being dramatic here...but it really feels this way.  And it sucks.

       I seem to recall a conversation I had with my girlfriend (?) a while back when she was applying for the exchange program that would bring her to the states so that we could be together. I told here that it was really important that she was coming here as much for her schooling and career and future as it was that she was coming here for me. Oh, yes, yes, she told me...of course.We spoke last night. "you know, it's not the school thing that scares me. I could care less about going to school at UCLA. The only reason I was going was so I could be with you. Now, I'm not sure if I even want to be in a relationship anymore." So, she was dishonest...with me, probably with herself. Heartbreak sucks. I'm supposed to still have hope. But she may not come here...not even for a visit. not even to find out if she still loves me. She said that she's so paralized by fear that she's just gone emotionally numb. She thinks that maybe all of the things she felt about me are still underneath it all, but what if she comes here and she still can't feel for me any more. I told her that I deserve to have her come here and break up with me face to face if nothing else.I spent the rest of the evening feeling very drained and guarded, with my room-mate and some friends and a bottle of vanilla stoli. I didn't drink much. My friend Francoise gave me some really good advice. "How old is Jake?" she asked? 27. Ya, this sounds like a 20-something thing to me, she began to explain. This is the thing about love. When you're in love with someone...sometimes the feelings are strong...sometimes they fade...and sometimes they go away comepletely. But you only have to be patient because they come back. And you can't go insane about it when they do fade sometimes, because it just makes things scary in a really unnecessary way. Be patient with Jake. And just tell yourself that everything's fine, and Jake will still come, and you guys will be ok. And she's gonna be so glad she came once she's here. She just has to make the transition as difficult as she possibly can right now, and that's her thing, not yours. And if for some reason it doesn't work...grieve it then. But don't grieve in now. Just be patient and give her some space.I felt so much peace when she told me that. It was like, ya, that's what I know in my heart. I got a bit more cheery after that. Of course this morning I woke up feeling like shit and obsessing about the whole thing, which is just my way. I wish I could go back to that moment with Francoise and just live there until this whole thing is over. I'm too god-damned delicate for this stupid shit. And I know I deserve more than what I'm getting right now. But it's never that simple. It's not like I'm being purposfully fucked over. It's not like Jake wants to hurt me. And it's not like this is easy for her either. It all just sucks.If you pray, meditate, whatever...take a moment for me. I could really use some good energy my way...a little peace of mind maybe.
