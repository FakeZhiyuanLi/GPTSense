      Yaaaawww... good morning. I just had some rye-bred with butter and jam (strawberry and organge/ingwer from france), a Café Latte and an Egg for breakfast.  I'm having a cold. YUK. Damn, I really hate this feeling. But I'll go back to the office tomorrow though. Fortunately I can stay home for two days without haveing to go to the doctor for approval. Not really feeling healthy though...  Next weekend I'll see my love again. Yippie! Really hope, things'll work out and that's now something lasting. Really wishing that... Never had such a young BF like him. Funny. Youngest so far was 28...  So, the word "nervousity" doesn't exist. Thanks my dear to tell me... let's add it right behind my fav "stressy". LOL. Hey, but I'm sure everybody knew what I meant ;-)  The weekend after the coming one we'll probably drive to Kärnten (the most southern district of Austria, @ the border to former Jugoslavia and Italy) to a Friend of chris who's making a poolparty/BBQ. Should be fun, although I'm nervous... so many people I don't know. Well, we'll see what'll happen.  Ok, now I'll have to fill the Dishwasher... god, you can't imagine how much I love that machine. ROFL.  ciao, Holger

      10 days have rushed by and I don't really know where they're gone too... I'm off from work today as I've got a terrible cold on the "Chillvalley Festival" which I've been to from Saturday to Sunday. We'll see how I'm doing later on today, maybe work tomorrow...  I've been to Paris! Yipppieeeee! Well, but the start wasn't that good. When we were at the ticketmachine a colleague called and told me my boss died. I haven't had a very good relation with him but Sabine told me I turned white and looked really quite bad... We've had the funeral last Wednesday - I suppose I got the cold from there. However, we got the tickets and took the RER (Reseau Express Regional) to the inner City and I've been very proud I found the way to the hotel without ANY map :-D!     We've spent some terriffic days in Paris and I've mad a very good friend. He's Flightattendant (very handsome) and really very nice. I'm glad I know him. Of course also I'm glad of knowing Thierry for many years now who also joined us. Man, I can tell you, I've never had such terriffic food before. And it wasn't too expensive. Once we payed for three persons about 67EUR (=81USD) which ain't to bad. It's true, Fance offers terriffic food, and imagine, I'm saying this as an Austrian!!!  We've visited many places I've already been before. But it still was amazing, also the much cooler wheather we've had than last summer was very very nice.  Christophe, Sabine & Thierry    Hôtel De Ville @ night    Sabine & I at Parc des buttes chaumont    The Eiffel-Tower    Christophe & The Cow    Holger, Christophe & Sabine    Welll, but another TERRIFFIC thing has happened! You remember, I told you I dated that guy that formerly lived quite nearby, the one that went to school with my best friends?? Well, not to the same school, but the same city? Well, he's my boyfriend now! LOL. Sometimes things happen so damn fast, I can't even believe it by myself... but we've spent this weekend together and it was simply perfect. We get along with eachother very well and his eyes...aaaaaw...I'm simply very very happy I met him :-) Very happy not having to seek anymore. We'll see, if things'll work out, but I believe they will!  Well, that's it for today. I think I'll go to the sofa and watch some DVD. Should be the best, no need to have the cold longer than a few days.  greetz, Holger

      ... just a short entry today... time rushes, my take-off to Paris comes nearer and nearer and I'm a bit nervous. LOL. A good nervousity. But I've to do so many things and my days are way to short now, as it seems.   But: Got my new digicam yesterday. GREAT pics, I've to admitt. I'm very positively surprised. But you'll surely read more within the next weeks, specially documented with some pics from Paris :-)  Well, at least all clothes are washed and ironed, the package is already almost completely packed and everything's great. Ah, and yeah, the guy I dated said I'd have to pay attention, he'd possibly fall in love with me...not sure about things on my side... guess I really need that brake to find myself somehow...  Well, but for today I've to finish here, need to study some grammar! :-/  hugz, Holger

      My job bores me more and more... although, some days it's quite funny, you know when you've got the right ammount of stress and also of time you really can do your work. But after four years everything starts to look the same, and it doesn't really "use" all my abilities... ...I'm thinking more and more to really go to Paris for a year... Should I? Is it fair for my granny who lives in my house? I don't know, but on the other side if I don't do it now, I'll never do it again, so the time'd be good. Next year...  Damn, in four days at this time (it's now 16:22) I'll already be in the plane to Paris. Yesss. The rest of the clothes I want to take with me is in the washer... wanted to go to the sunstudio today but: It's closed. Really starting to dislike the countryside! You know, it's normal that there's no business, no open stores here in Austria on Saturday from 17:00 on and nothing at all on sundays. But I fucking can't understand why they close the sundstudio/swimmbath on Mondays?? Or why do they close the smaller stores on Thursday afternoon??? Really want to meet the guy that had these stupid ideas. LOL ;-)  However, got time left so that's the best reason to write this new blogg today.  I've dicided to get me a new digital cam, I suppose I've mentioned that already. Today I've ordered it! First time I had luck: The guy on the phone said that they gave me the last piece as my order was worth more than the one from another customer - they had to achieve some sorta turnover. LOL. The cam should arrive tomorrow noon! And I've to leave to the dentist before I can open the package.  Can you imagine? People are existing that open packages of new computerequipment not for months!! Really! Same think of cutting their hair to a quarter of an inch (which should be somewhat of 3mm or so) which is a bit short, but half an inch would definitely look damn handsome. What do you think my dear?? However, I CAN'T wait a month (or even some hours) to open a package when I know it's arrived. LOL. Will be hard to have my appointment with my dentist tomorrow...  You know what? It happened again... the guy two nights ago: I think he fell in love with me. LOL. Well, but the positive thing is, that I can't say neither yes nor no to that I couldn't possibly also fall in love with him...hmm... we'll see what'll happen.  I wished I had the more will to do work in my garden. But it doesn't really excite me to do that stuff alone :-/ Fortunately my granny knows one that mowes the lawn. 2,5hrs more for myself...:-)  My job bores me more and more... although, some days it's quite funny, you know when you've got the right ammount of stress and also of time you really can do your work.

      Yaaaawww... 5hrs of sleep definitely ain't enough for me. Although, last night I've had a good reason for, if you know what I mean. ROFL.  Naw, was really nice. One of those kinda dates that are honestly nice. Nice person, good looks, good conversation and good...  . Very nice. Guess he wants to see me again ;-)  Wondering whether I should get me a new TFT-Screen. My old Sony ain't the best and 15" isn't really enough for video-editing. Ebay has a 19" screen at 321€ - guess that's a good deal! Also should buy a new digicam (Minolta Dimâge A1) for a Festival I should take pics at... http://www.chillvalley.at Should I?? Hmm...  The wheather isn't good these days. Rain yesterday and also the day before. Today everything looks grey and unhappy... and the fact I've to go to the office tomorrow morning doesn't really make things better. LOL. Guess "that's life", huh?  BUT: Next Friday, 4pm, I'll sit in the plane to Paris. YEAH! Strike!! Just four days, well, actually only three, but it's definitely worth it. I love that city...  French studies are well! Still within my time-schedule! I'm very well behaved ;-)  Now I'll go and watch some TV... some workout as well. ...  greetz, Holger

      Another day passed by. Good! Live goes on and on... it was a quite and very nice saturday so far! Today I got up at 8:30 which is quite late with view on the fact that I get up at 4:45 each day during the week...had a nice breakfast and cleaned my rooms. One thing that's good if you're expecting visitors - you've a reason to do some shores. LOL.  I've had a coffee with Chris today in my favourite Café. Damn, that man's cute! The funny thing is he went to the neighbour school when I was in school as well, so I surely must have seen him then! Gracie (i call my best friend Gracie, she calls me Will, you know that Sitcom "Will & Grace??") also came and we've had a good time. Much fun... although I think Chris didn't understand all of our jokes?! However, we've had a good time. Guess what, he'll visit me later on this evening :-D  Not sure whether I should cook something nice.... guess not. No real ambition to do so... a Pizza should be enough, and some wine. LOL.  I've had one part of my daily french-studies. It still goes ahead very well. Suppose I'll do the second part right now...  Curious where this evening will lead to....  bye for now, Holger

      Ella sings "Puttin' on the Ritz"... Well, I didn't really figure out so far what that means... I love those songs but mostly songs of that time don't really have a meaning, their lyrics are mostly crap, but I love them though. And: Wasn't Ella the most wonderful Jazz-Singer that ever lived? Ella, I love you. LOL  Yesterday noon I decided the need of a huge ammount of cheesesauce. You know those days you come home from work and you're simply hungry and want quickly somthing to eat that gives you that "stop it, I don't want to see any food anymore"-feeling? Cheesesauce which you can put on some Pasta or even Vegetables is definitely that kinda food.  How to make it? It's easy: You need onions, milk, grinded cheese, flour, basil, pepper, salt, muscat, butter. The quantities depend on the thickness you want your sauce, the type of cheese you use on the ammount of fat you wanna have in ur sauce as well as the taste you want to give it. So take some butter (or oil), cut the onions to very small pieces and fry them in a small pan. For 1l sauce I use 2 onions, for example. Put that beside, take a huge pot, and melt some butter. Put flour in and wait until it gets a nice yellow color. Put the milk in and boil that. You'll see, just befor the Milk's cooking the sauce will become thick. Pay attention NOT to boil the milk! Put your fav-cheese, the muscat, salt, pepper and basil (gives it some sorta italian touch) in the sauce and let it on the stove for about 15mins. DON'T boil the sauce!! Keep stiring the sauce. -> That's it! If you want to make it "light" use low-fat cheese, low fat milk, less butter (50% fat) etc.  Ain't that easy?? I love that sauce. LOL  Yesterday night, it was round 1am or so... could have had a date! My god, was right before doing that. Can you imagine? Naw, normally I don't even think on that... but sometimes... you know. Well, we decided to meet today, funny thing is, he ain't to far away, just some 30km or so, damn cute, great smile... well, we'll see :-D  I should cut the roses today, in the garden. We've had a terrible thunderstorm this night but the ground is real wet which is the best time for doing such things... well, but I haven't got any real intention, neither want to go outside nor to the drugstore to get the humus... pfff, I'm bored...  Well, guess that's it for the moment...  a bientôt, Holger

      Now that's it, huh? Holger's got his own Blog in the World Wide Web. Woo-Hoo! Well, hope you'll be patient with me; english ain't my mothertongue, but I'm trying my best ;-)  ...what to write in an open-blog in the WWW?? Yawn, I'm tired. Yesterday was somehow a long day, you know... those kinda days you get up in the morning, go to the office, and although the day wasn't THAT exhausting itself you're completely done in the evening. Well, had a phoneconference with my customers in the UK. Those guys are cool. Andy & Paul, they're allways having great fun, doing jokes and make it easyer for me giving them bad news, every once a while.  But sitting an hour there at ur desk and talking on the phone...pfff, haven't had any voice left after that. LOL. But it was OK.  Yeah, and got the samlples for the new tiles of my bathroom-floor! Damn nice I've to admit. Well, not really cheap... 52€ per m²... but I just need 6m² so that's no big deal.  Jef has to go to Germany, well maybe. So he's managing director in Austria ain within the leadership in Munich... it's possible he'll have to leave Austria and go Munich again. Not sure if I should be sad cause I think this fact ain't the best Base for a relationship, huh?  My french studies are going quite well... although just have learned vocabluaries so far... not really done grammar. I should, huh? Grammar is hard, not as easy as english grammar (all english nativespeakers: forgive me). But it's true, french is hard. Very hard. Almost as hard as German! Imagine, you've to change the ending of every single word just to put a sentence from singular to plural etc. I'm used to that in German, but in French it's new and hard. LOL. But I'm quite good in learnig languages so, thumbs up, it'll work out.  Well, last point: special thanks to my very very dear friend Glen who told me about this site and whom I'm very proud and happy of to know him.  Ok, enough for my "first time" here! Hope wasn't to boring, Holger

      God, I really hate these "you have to" things... GRRR. Already got up today. IT's 7:25 in the morning and today I could have slept longer very well...  I've to go to the doctor as I need a "confirmation" that I'm sick for work. Everytime we're sick longer than two days we need such a confirmation. Means: Sittin hours and hours waiting until the doctor lets you in just for saying "you had fever so you really shouldn't work until next week"! God, I know I had fever and I wouldn't have worked before next monday.  Fortunately I feel good enough not to need any medicaments. You don't have to pay much for them here but I prefer not to pay anything at the doctors. Of course I'll have to get such a paper from my office for about 3.50EUR but it's ok.  So I'm sitting here now, having my coffee and thinking on goin' to the doctor at 8:00. Wil have to have a shower as well before.  Chris comes home from vienna today! Not sure if it's a good idea if he'll visit me today. Don't want to get him sick as well... it's his holidays... Well, we'll see what we'll do.  so much for now, and here're some holiday-fotos:             bye, Holger

      Just a short message... I'm sick, got the flu with 39,1°C (102,38F) yesterday and today just slightly better. I feel miserable... Next point is that it doesn't look very good to my colleagues if I'm sick right after my holidays. Third issue is that I won't buy the new car as this fu**ing Dealer won't take back my old car. Well, but can live with this fact, just the way he treated me really got me pissed off. Well, BF is in Vienna right now as he's to get his car repaired, I miss him...  Just had a shower and will now get back to the TV... I'm tired and my head aches.  Holiday-Fotos will follow, I promise.  Holger

      Yeah, today's the day! Good morning!! Today we'll leave in the early afternoon for Croatia... it'll be a drive of about 9 hours... YUK. Going to hate that I suppose. But each will have single trips of 2 hours than the other continues driving. Shouldn't be to bad, and of course the car is airconditioned. LOL.  We're having terriffic wheather the last days! Each day with bright sunshine (here in Vienna where I currently am) and over 30°C! Love it. Although in the flat it's damn hot... should go out more during days but all friends are working and the male ones I would know... well, Chris would be quite jealous if I met one for a coffee. So no need for that either. Than there'd be the possibility of going to one of those huge electronic-markets. But, they're just a reason to spend money I don't have now :-/ LOL. Hope I'll at least have the money for the fuel for my new car (If I really can buy it - depends on if I agree with the dealer on a good price or not)...  Well... thinking on whether there're any other news... no, nothing serious! Yesterday I've been with a good Friend, Sabine (she's the one was in Paris with this early summer) in the "Stadtpark", a green spot in the middle of Vienna for lunchbrake. Was really nice. Yeah, and the evening before (monday evening) we've all been to the "KJU" (Q), drank some Cocktails, talked and laughed much. We were about 7 persons and it's been really nice although the music wasn't to good.  The plan for today's: Wait for my BF until 1pm, than get all the stuff put into the car, drive to the doctor and get the results of our HIV-Test we've just made last monday morning and than drive to croatia! Yeah!!   HIV-Tests... definitely one of the things I REALLY hate. Even if you're sure nothing can be wrong and the test must be negative, you start thinking IF there could be anything with this or that one... etc. etc. That sucks. Well, everyone that ever had this test knows what I'm talking about.  But that enough for now,  suppose I'll do some ironing and continue with my french course (got my laptop with me ;-))  a bientôt, Holger

      Gooood morning :-) It's sunday, the sun is shining (seems as if it's the first time this "summer") it's warm and I feel soooo good. I'm on holidays, no work next week, and I suppose I'll leave my cellphone switched off. Yess.  I also took last Friday off, allways good to have a short week before and after a week off. Had time to do some shores, do the washing and baking an applepie. Turned out real well. Chris and also my granny loved it.   Yesterday Chris and I went to the "Lunzer See" which is a very beautiful lake in the middle of the mountains.      We took one of those pedalboats and cruised on the lake. Bright sunshine and we got a nice tan! LOL. Very very nice. Loved it! Later that day Chris drove home as his mother had her birthday some days ago, so time to be a "good son".  Granny likes him. Funny...they allways chat a bit. Also a good feeling...  I've already done a checklist as we'll leave today to our holiday! I've to pack everything together and later on today we'll leave to vienna. Wednesday in the early afternoon we'll leave to Kroatia, I hope we won't arrive to late :-/.  We're going to do tomorrow morning in Vienna the HIV-Test. I fucking hate that. Although you know there's almost no chance to "have it" it's a very uncomfortable time to wait on the results...YUK. But, when we get the results we'll have a very nice vacation...  The time I'm going to buy my new car comes nearer and nearer... The dealer in the city where I work in has one. Color: black, seats: red leather, motor: Diesel, 120PS/89kW...              Only problem is: He wants round 28.300EUR for this car! But, you know what? I'll buy it! I fell in love with this piece of metal and I can't help to do anything against it. You know, sometimes you should do something spontaneous, a friend said, and he's damn right!  Ok, but for now I need to get something for breakfast, I'm starving. LOL.  ciao, Holger

      How long has it been?? Well, I don't know (and I'm to lazy to look after now). LOL. Chris and I've been on the party of a good friend of him, Andy. She's a really amazing beautiful girl and very very nice. She made this party in Kärtnen at the Faaker Lake and fortunately we've had quite good wheather! We left Vienna round 4pm last Friday and arrived round 8:30pm. Hard drive, much rain and slippery roads.  Andies father made a great BBQ, loved it. Didn't drink to much.  LOL, we slept at the attic in some sort of studio Andies Brother had. Weird. But a nice situation...  Next day, saturday, we left her and her parents round noon and drove to Klagenfurt for some shopping and a coffee, than we drove to St.Stefan ob Stainz which's right in the middle of the "Schilcher-Wine-Area", southern Styria. An amazing beautiful area, love and loved it. When I was together with my first BF I almost lived there for about two years! We spent the night at my favourite restaurant, the "Schilcherlandhof Gerngroß"   urlLink KLICK Landgasthof Gerngroß   Well and I'm thinking about really getting myself a new car... it's planned for next year, June but I think I can't wait anymore. The problem is I'll have to get the money from the bank which I really don't like to do. But every once a while you've to contraher some risq I think. The new car will be a Renault Mégane CC which's standing for "Coupé Cabriolet". It's got a hardtop that folds itself down in luggage boot. It's so bautiful and not too expensive for a Cabrio (round 30.000EUR = 37.000USD)... We'll see. My favorized Dealer has the one I want as a demonstration-car, which means it's about 3000EUR cheaper than if it's new. Black colored with red/black leather seats... DAMN, I love that car. I see it each day I drive to work... What shall I do?? Shall I buy it?? This friday Chris and I will meet the dealer to talk a bit, and after our trip to Croatia I think I'll buy it...  Well, so much for now, need to get some shores done in here,  c ya, Holger

      Aaaw, it's been quite a while since my last entry! However, not much time left today. Finally got myself to do some workout today. Had quite a busy day at work and had to get my car repaired once again. Well, actually they just had to change the brake-wedges (is that an english word??), readjust the fronttyres and change the fronttyres... another 300EUR gone.  Well, things with Chris seem to work out well. We've had a damn nice weekend, partly at my home, partly at his parents home. Both romantic and hot, and I don't only mean the wheather. LOL. Although: We've had enough sun for some bathing in the pool :-)  Last Friday I bought a new satellite receiver called "dreambox". It's amazing, installed a Harddisc with 80GB and now got an DVR as well. YESSSS. One problem is that the start-current of the harddrive(s) is to high the my dreambox hangs every once a while it boots.... ordered an condensator-cable at eBay, hope it'll be here soon. That should solve this problem. But works well, to view pictures and listen to MP3 with the dreambox and I can also mount a folder on my PCs Harddrive (through Ethernet) to the dreambox so it can access all my music, for example... amazing. And that's all for just 349EUR.  Next weekend Chris and I are invited for a BBQ in Kärnten what's about 3,5hrs drive away from Vienna... I#m not sure if it'll be nice... Having some problem with going out to long here, don't know why, but not really into meeting new people, well, I mean not into going out for meeting new people. I could stay very long with good friends... naw, I hate myself for that...:-( Chris doesn't understand... and I don't understand how anybody could come home at 7am. Never done that, don't know what it's like and how it works... but did I miss anything?? Can you tell? I don't know, I'm quite happy the way it was so far...  Chris invited me for a dinner yesterday evening. It was soooo nice. Damn good food in the "Bräuhof" in Steyer, Upper Austria. And he made breakfast this morning even though I had to get up at 5am!...guess I love him...:-D  Well, but i've to have a shower now and finish my vocabluary-training for today.  ciao, Holger

      You know, work on mondays is crap. But it's even worse if you planned your holiday and planned to begin working on a wednesday what'd have been wonderful. Relaxed from the holidays, a short week, just three days working, and your main-customers would have had their company-holidays in exactly that week. But what do you get? BUMMER!!   If you're me, you get sick on the Tuesday before the day you want to go back to work, you get 39°C fever and stay at home.  And what's the result?? WORK ON A MONDAY. God, I really hate that.  Everybody is in the same mood "why have I go back to work, why I?" and all is crap. Plus, and that's the joker, you've to do the work of two weeks you missed AND your substitution is also on holidays for one additional week. Lucky you - well, me, huh?? You can imagine how motivated I am for tomorrow. YEAH!!!! Gimme more!! YEAAAAHHH!!!  Well, but things could be worse so I shouldn't sound to mad, huh? I'm quite healthy again, no fever (though these constant 37,4°C I have don't seem right???) and my man was here until today late afternoon. His mother likes me and thinks I'm very handsome even though she never saw me in person so far (I sent her some fresh cake today though ;-) and his sister in law thinks the same. Actually we're invited for her 30.Birthday-Party this friday! Not sure if I should go there... we'll see! I mentioned that Chris' brother works for the same company I work for, right?   Well, I got 205EUR out of taxes so I bought three more or less new WMF-Knifes today through eBay! The whole thing is at 102,45EUR for three knifes and some steering equipment. The total if I'd bought it new would have been about 280EUR!! So that's a damn good price for superbe quality!  Today I created a new recipe! Plenta-dumplings... hard to translate, they're no real dumplings, much smaller and somewhat oval... should have done a photo, huh? But they tasted great. Quite much work to cook though. BUT: Without any FAT!!  Well, have to get up tomorrow again at 4:50am. And it's been about 14 days new I haven't got up before 7! Time for bed!  ciao, Holger
