      I sent a friend of mine who is in love with Nicole Kidman an article I found about how she apparently doesn't have any men knocking at her door ( urlLink see article ). He wrote her a letter announcing he would have no problem dating her.   I told him to send it to her publicist, but he never will. So, if Nicole Kidman or her publicist (or even Tom Cruise for that matter) happens to read this, please refer Nicole to this website.  urlLink Theomorph's letter to Nicole .

      There are several skills some people have but can't put on a resume. As useful as these skills are in the workplace, you can't exactly use these as strengths when interviewing for a job.   1. Able to ignore all the useless crap your boss says during a deadline and only listen to the relevant bits and pieces that actually affect you.    I happen to think this one is absolutely necessary to maintain your sanity when you work in an office.   2. Able to finish my work before deadline and still find time to blog, email, read comics and play the occassional game of text twist on the Internet.   Again, your employer probably wouldn't look upon this particular skill too highly. I, however, think it's an excellent skill that everyone should master.  That's all I can think of right now, but feel free to add to the list.

      I just had a drink from this place called  urlLink Boba Loca . I've been there before and had a plain mocha frapaccinno that was fine. Today, I decided to be brave and try one with the boba balls, which are these brown tapioca balls.   So I am holding the drink and pick up this fat straw (because you need one to suck up the boba). Then I take a sip and get one of those balls in the first sip. The boba sits in my mouth for awhile while I try to figure out what to do with it. It tastes nasty. It's too hard to just swallow, so I have to chew it. It leaves this nasty aftertaste in my mouth, so I take another sip of the mocha. Only I get another freaking boba ball in my mouth.   I started to gag. I sucked it up the rest of the way and spit the boba into a napkin. And I'll never go back again.

      This story is pretty cool. The  urlLink  Lincoln Park apes  can now blast visitors with air if the visitors bug them by pounding on the glass. The people who do that are stupid and deserve to have the crap scared out of them (not thrown at them).   I was at the L.A. Zoo this one time and this little monkey got mad at me for taking his picture, so he stuck his little monkey penis through the chain link fence and tried to pee on me. That wasn't fun.

      I'm having some pretty morbid thoughts tonight and thought I might share one. I've been thinking about this one for awhile now, and I sort of think the idea is rather brilliant. If not brilliant, at least original. Or psychotic. Or typical of me, which would be a combination of all of the above.   When I die, I want to be cremated and put into little tea bags. You know the kind that you put the actual tea leaves into that are open on the top? That kind. Then I want the tops to be tied with string. Blue string. And then I want everyone important in my life who is still living to each throw a tea bag into Boston Harbor. It can be my great statement against the government for taxation without representation (those jerks take at least $700 out of every paycheck!!) and a tie to one of the great, hilarious events in American history. I've tried to figure out something that would tie in to the Salem Witch hunts in some way, but, sadly, cannot.

      I was talking to my friend about my new opinion on the Kobe thing, and she made me realize that I was being insensitive about the rape victim. She's claiming she was raped and we shouldn't be doubting her. She's not the one who we have to prove guilty/innocent, Kobe is. While I still think she's disturbed for having sex with one or multiple partners after being raped, maybe it's not our business to know that information. It's just hers. Of course, if Kobe Bryant forced me to have sex with him and ripped me all up, I would be too traumatized the next day to have sex with another guy...but that's just me. But in any case, since I'm not the alleged victim, I can't really say anything about the situation. I just think a world where rape exists at all is jacked up, and think a world where a woman (or a man for that matter) can't bring people who commit rape to justice because nobody believes that they were actually raped is even worse.

      I've been thinking about this lately and decided that I don't really think Kobe should go to prison anymore. While I still think he's a whiny baby, and an adulterer, I don't think that chick was really all that innocent. To quote Britney Spears, who I abhor, "I'm not that innocent." Well, that's that girl. So, yes, Kobe is overpayed to run back and forth throwing a ball into a basket, but, no, he shouldn't go to jail for raping someone who just seems to want to play the "victim" card.

      So there's this  judge  in Oklahoma who has been accused of not only playing with himself a la Pee Wee Herman, but even using a penis pump and shaving his nuts while in court. Not while in his chambers, which I could, maybe, accept. But no, in court, with a court reporter next to him. Wrong. That's so wrong. Dirty old, disgusting specimen of a man.

      Arnold Schwarzenegger is an idiot. First he takes away money from education. Now he wants to kill innocent animals. He's a freaking idiot. Right now, animal shelters can euthanize animals after holding them for six days. Arnold wants to change that to three. What difference does it even make? So what if it saves a little money? Yes, stray animals are a problem, but why can't be find other ways to tighten the budget. Stop buying fancy pens and pencils for government employees. Get the cheap ones. Don't give congressmen their own electric cars. Let them drive their own damn vehicle like the rest of us have to do. Charge the extremely wealthy a luxury tax. They can afford it. But leave animals who can't help it they have to inhabit a state with an incompetent governor who never should have been elected alone.   Arnold's f@$#% up proposition .

      I was sitting on a bench waiting for the tram this morning and this crazy woman wearing disgusting, dingy, used-to-be-white tennis shoes walked by. On her left wrist, she was wearing, and I kid you not, at least 9 bangle bracelets. I'm not even talking about the thin, itty-bitty ones. They were thick. So as she walks by, I'm thinking, "Does she stand in front of the mirror in the morning and say, 'no, eight bracelets just isn't enough, I need at least one more'?"

      A person like me is a person who can have a perfectly normal, happy life one day and the next have a freak of nature bug bite her in the ass and cause an infection. When you get drugs for said infection, you start vomiting nonstop. Then, rather than lose weight from your inability to eat, you gain it. AND you scrape the side of your car on a freaking post. As if the rest of the crap I've been through in the past week wasn't enough.

The nuptials took place Friday afternoon at a private Northern California ranch. This is the third marriage for Cage, who wed actress PATRICA ARQUETTE in April of 1995. Their divorce became final in August of 2001 after a long separation. Cage married LISA MARIE PRESLEY in a private ceremony in Hawaii in August 2002. Their union lasted three months before they announced their split.

      I heard about this  urlLink mystery creature  on the radio this morning. It seemed intriguing, and I thought for sure it was just a bunch of Baltimorians who were too stupid to recognize a dog. (No offense if you are from there, but I know a stupid person who grew up near there).  Anyway, I had to do some research, and I found photos! Twelve of them!!! And I can't figure out what the hell it is either. From a distance, it kind of looks like one of those miniature horses. Then I look at another picture, and it looks like a dog, with skinny greyhound legs and long hair around the face. The next shot makes me think it's  an aardvark or ant eater. In another picture, it just looks like a dog mixed with a fox. The next shot makes it look like a wild bore with a rat tail.   I guess the people of Baltimore county are calling it a hyote, a combination of coyote and hyena. The weirdest thing is nobody seems afraid of it and it doesn't bother dogs or cats in the neighborhood. I wonder how long it will be before someone captures it and tries to figure out what it is. Then I wonder how long before it goes nuts and attacks someone.

I did have a dream where I was friends with Jennifer Garner when she plays Electra, which is weird because I've never seen  Daredevil . In the same dream, someone gave me three McDonalds salt packets and told me to open them somewhere secret. I go to the bathroom, but it's so freaking crowded it's ridiculous. Anyway, I open the packets and salt goes everywhere...people think I've got drugs and call the cops. I find little bits of a check inside each of the packets. I have no clue why they're there or what they're for. Next thing I know, I'm in a court room, giving the check bits to a judge.

It's a waste of time. Instead of living my own life, I am watching them live their real/fake ones. I'm not sure how different it is from sit-coms. Anyway...I hated  Trading Spouses  and won't watch it again.   Now  The Casino  is on. It's only been a couple minutes and I'm already bored.

      Sometimes I wonder why I work in the profession I do. Then little things remind me. I'm just not a people person. I would be horrible at customer service. I need a job with as little human contact as possible. Yes, there are some days when I need someone to talk to or I go insane, but if I have to talk to that person about work, I'd rather be alone.  I don't like working in groups unless I have to, and if I have to, I like to have my own individual part.  When I worked in the movie theater for all of seven months, this woman ordered a small popcorn. She asked for butter flavoring (i.e., chemicals). I pumped one pump of butter on her popcorn because that's what we used for a small. (This was back in the day when the concession workers did the butter still). Anyway, she asked for more. I pumped one more time. She said, no do one more. So I did. Then the stupid, fat bitch went to my manager and complained that I was trying to give her a heart attack by making her popcorn swim in butter.   Another time, Eric Estrada came to my theater. He seemed all bent out of shape that I didn't know who he was. I did. I was like...you're the cop guy. But because I didn't know the name of the show (I'm sorry, but it first aired almost three years to the day before I was conceived and ended when I was three), he had a mini-shit fit. So I dumped a large tub of buttered popcorn on him. I swear it wasn't on purpose, but maybe subconsciously it was.  Another time this drunk man came up to me while I was working as an usher taking tickets and hit on me. I told him to go to hell, right in front of my manager. Same thing happened while I was working as a receptionist at a cancer center. It's not like I said it to a patient, someone who could potentially die...I said it to the driver of one of those medic van/taxi things.   Anyway, people just bug me.

I would watch it today if it was on one of the movie channels...  Then I would feel like writing a 20-page paper about how I am disgusted and embarrassed to live in this state.

      Today, I'm letting Avril Lavigne speak for me...    Sometimes I get so weird  I even freak myself out  I laugh myself to sleep  It's my lullaby  Sometimes I drive so fast  Just to feel the danger  I want to scream  It makes me feel alive   Is it enough to love?  Is it enough to breath?  Somebody rip my heart out  And leave me here to bleed  Is it enough to die?  Somebody save my life  I'd rather be anything but ordinary please   To walk within the lines  Would make my life so boring  I want to know that I  Have been to the extreme  So knock me off my feet  Come on now give it to me  Anything to make me feel alive   Let down your defenses  Use no common sense  If you look you will see  that this world is this beautiful  accident, turbulent, succulent  opulent, permanent  No way I wanna taste it  Don't wanna waste it away

      I'm taking these green tea pills because they are supposed to help speed up your metabolism and burn fat when you exercise. I will try anything once, so I'm trying them for a month to see if they actually work.   Well, so far all I can tell that they actually do is make me have to pee. Every 30 minutes. My coworkers are going to think I'm on drugs. I guess this time they'd be right.

      I had my appointment at the DMV today. It was the second appointment to renew my driver's license. Yes, the second. I went once before, stood in line, had the horrible photo taken...all of that. I sat at home and waited for the new license to come in the mail. Two months and an expired paper license later, there was no license. I called to see if they sent it to someone else, or my old address. No, they informed me that the photo didn't save to the system. You'd think they'd have the courtesy to let me know.  &nbsp; The DMV was crowded. Yeah, I know. What the heck do I&nbsp;expect? It's Saturday for crying out loud. But there was no parking in the lot or on the street. I had to park at Bob's Big Boy and walk there. I entered the building from the appointment side, since I actually had one, and hit someone with the door on&nbsp;my way in because the&nbsp;building was filled beyond capacity. It was full of 16-year-olds&nbsp;standing in line for horrible photos that will haunt them for the rest of their lives and women with names so long they can't sign them on the now electronic sign-pad-thingees.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I was assured that the photo is in the system this time, and I even got to see it on the computer screen. It's not good, but it is an improvement from the last one. Hopefully, it will actually arrive in the mail.

      I finally finished the book. It only took a month to read the tiny thing. I guess I shouldn't start a book while I'm in the middle of an accelerated class with buttloads of reading.   I was a little disappointed in the book. It wasn't as funny as the reviews made it sound. As a stickler, I still liked it, but not as much as I thought I would. This is my favorite part.   When I was about fourteen years old, a friend at school who spent the summer holidays in Michigan set me up with an American pen-pal. This is not an episode I am proud to remember. In fact, one day I hope to be able to forget it: the ensuing correspondence, after all, ran to only three pages, and no one from the Oxford University Press has, as yet, suggested collecting it in book form with scholarly apparatus and footnotes. But for the time being I need to get it off my chest, so here it is. The trouble was, Kerry-Anne was an everyday teenager with no literary pretentions - and for some reason this made the precocious blue-stocking in me feverishly uncomfortable. When her first letter arrived (she had pluckily set the ball rolling) I was absolutely appalled. It was in huge handwriting, like an infant's. It was on pink paper, with carefree spelling errors - and where the dots over the I's ought to be, there were  bubbles . "I am strawberry blonde," she wrote, "with a light dusting of freckles." In hindsight I see it was unrealistic to expect a pen-pal from the 8th grade in Detroit to write like Samuel Johnson. But on the other hand, what earthly use to me was this vapid mousey moron parading a pigmentational handicap?  To this day I am ashamed of what I did to Kerry-Anne (who unsurprisingly never wrote back). I replied to her childish letter on grown-up deckled green paper with a fountain pen...I know I deliberately dropped the word "desultory," and I think I may even have used some French...The main reason I recall this shameful teenage epiphany, however, is that in my mission to blast little Kerry-Anne out of the water, I pulled out (literally) all the stops: I used a semicolon. "I watch television in a desultory kind of way; I find there is not much on," I wrote. And it felt so good. It felt fantastic. It was like that bit in  Crocodile Dundee  when our rugged hero scoffs at the switchblade of his would-be mugger, and produces a foot-long weapon of his own, "Call that a knife? THAT's a KNIFE."   I think I liked this part so much because I did something very similar to my freshman roommate.

      Do you know how sometimes smells bring back memories? Well, I don't know what I just smelled. Maybe it was a combination of peanuts and soap...Anyway, it reminded me of the first boy I ever loved.  I didn't know his name. All I knew is that he was sitting by me at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Phoenix, Arizona in 1989 (or somewhere around there) and he made me feel all tingly and gave me butterflies. *Sigh* Oh, the memories.  Hmm...I'm not sure now if he was the first or second boy I loved. There was this guy in fourth grade who sat across from me. He had the same smell. Peanuts and soap :)

      I'm listening to  Coconut  by Harry Nilsson. If you don't know the song, it's featured in the movie  Practical Magic , which I have seen three times, but only because I forgot that I saw it the first two times until halfway through the movie.  Anyway, a coworker just walked in and heard "You put the lime in the coconut and drink it all up" and started laughing. Then she walked out.

      Someone who reads this blog said something that bothered me today. He'll know who he is when he reads this. It's not his fault that I was bothered. I guess if it's anyone's fault, it's mine. But I decided to write about it to get it out in the open and out of me. Sort of to clear the negative energy out of me thing.  Anyway, I dated this person when I was in high school. So, we're talking about six years ago. He said that his friend told him he's been really sarcastic/hurtful since he and I broke up.   This got me to thinking about many things. First, was it me that made him sarcastic? Did my sarcasm rub off on him and people didn't realize it until after I was out of the picture? Was it because I was a complete bitch to break up with someone when I was 18 and not in the mood for a relationship?   It also made me think about the things our boyfriend/girlfriend's friends say about us after a breakup. I am sure that I've been called everything under the sun. Now, most of the time, I just wouldn't care what people say about me. But it's kind of sad to think that someone who doesn't really know you could say something so mean about you because you broke up with their friend. Of all the horrible things I've said about people (and there have been horrible things, because, let's face it, sometimes people are just morons and deserve it), I don't remember ever saying anything bad about someone's ex.   Okay, venting over.

      I just got back from visiting the dogs at my parents' house. I gave them both baths because nobody else will and just visited with them for awhile because my parents are away and my brother ignores them.  When I got back to this apartment, which I have a love/hate relationship with, I discovered that the people who park next to my assigned spot parked their SUV on the line and partially into my spot.   The parking spots are for compact cars, which mine is. Their Toyota 4-Runner, or whatever the heck that monstrosity is, is not a compact car. Anyway, I still got into my spot, but I was dangerously close to hitting the pole I've already hit twice. I was going to just let it go and go up to my apartment, but I couldn't. So I got out a Washington Mutual deposit envelope and wrote them a note. It said:   Can you please not park your car (if you call this unnecessarily oversized tractor a car) on the line next time? It's already hard enough parking my car next to yours and when your SUV is partially in my spot, it's not any easier. Thanks.   If I'm a bitch for doing that, I can live with it.

      This morning when I walked out of the parking center into the waiting area for the tram, I saw someone I went to high school with. I've seen her a couple of times before, and seen her give me that "I think I know you" look, which I'm sure I've given her myself. Even though my look was a "I DO know you but hope to god you don't remember me because I don't want to talk to you" look. So even though I've seen her about five times now, I've managed to avoid conversation or acknowledging her.   I didn't think I'd get away with it again today. I walked out. I saw her. She saw me. I sat down and pretended to be looking at something interesting on my cell phone. Then this older woman I talk to sometimes waiting for the tram came out and said hi. I said hi. She said she was walking. I said, "Oh! I'll go with you!"  And I managed to avoid my past once again.  See, this girl I'm avoiding was someone who was friends with the friends I ate lunch with in high school. I was one of those people who hated cliques so much, she managed to be a part of about five different ones just to avoid association. At lunch, I hung out with the Christian good girl crowd. In class, I was part of the smart kid group and only talked to people who were in at least as many AP classes as me (mostly because they were the only people in my classes). And then I hung out with the journalism dorks, the writing club nerds and the pep squad. Yeah, the pep squad. Me, a person so far from peppy I don't think you could get there by any means of transportation.  I still keep in touch (sort of) with some of the Christian crowd. The girl who used to be this girl I'm avoiding's best friend told me that she had run into a bad crowd. While I'm a little curious what that means by her standards, I just don't want to deal with this person at all. She was the worst kind of airhead 6 years ago and I'm sure that couldn't have changed much.

      I watched the E! True Hollywood Story on the Hilton sisters over the weekend. I really didn't mean to watch it. When it came on, I wanted to change the channel, but couldn't find the remote control and didn't want to get up. So I watched...  I'm completely amazed that the parents didn't do more to try to control the girls (especially Paris) when they were younger. They would go out and party with them at clubs when the girls were 17 and 15.   Anyway, the girls are crazy, but they're rich as hell. And in this country (and basically anywhere in the world), if you're that rich, you can be as crazy as you want.  When the Britney Spears story came on, I got off my lazy butt to change the channel. The Hilton story was just about all the rich white chick action I could handle in one day.

      My horoscope was right on today...   "You've kept it bottled up and now your cork's about to burst. Open up. Let it out  (Yep...if one more crappy thing happens this month, I'm going to have a mental breakdown) ...You may attract large groups today or be part of a group that shares a common goal. They may be looking for a leader, and you have all the necessary qualifications. You will discover that many people are responsive to your ideas, and your group can make significant progress.  (At work I had to decide how to do the FAQ section for a website and they are using my idea. Sometimes I do have good ones.)  Despite these successes, you may be feeling a little emotional.   (Ummm...yeah. I cried when I got out of my car again today.)  Seek the help of a friend or acquaintance who has experience in what you are going through and can offer some clarity. Spending time with friends and like-minded people is the best strategy for the next couple of days. Your friends will be compassionate. It is a good time to tell people how you are feeling...Your partner is probably stuck in their own little world for a bit while you deal with real life. You haven't been abandoned -- it's just a little cosmic glitch that will soon smooth itself out."

      There are some days that I question my belief in God. It just seems sometimes like we're completely alone in the world. I start to believe that whole science theory over what the Bible has to say about the creation of earth. Reading  The Da Vinci Code  didn't help. I wanted to believe that everything in the book was true, that the New Testament was complete bunk.   The last month and a half has kind of proved to me that there has to be a God of some kind. But it's not a kind god, and there is no way God is female. If God was female, I would not have had to have my butt cut open. I would not have been on antibiotics that made me puke more than 30 times in two days. I would not have scraped the side of my car on a pole. I would not have crunched my bumper hitting the same pole two weeks later. And I wouldn't have run over a nail and gotten a flat tire. The last two things happened in the last two days.   These events have made me realize that there has to be a god, and he is vengeful. I am not sure what I did, but I'm sure that it must have been bad. Maybe it's the way I steer my car with my middle fingers all the way home from work just so I don't have to make an effort to cuss out the people who cut me off or break suddenly and cause my CDs to fly off the front seat onto the floor where I can't reach them. Maybe it's because I stopped praying. Or maybe it's the 15 years of my life I haven't gone to church. Whatever it was, I think I've been punished enough now. God can move on to another victim now.

      Yesterday, I totally went off on a checkout person at Michaels craft store. See, my freaking receipt blew away in the wing, and I had my hands full so I couldn't go chase after it. When I got home, I realized that I had purchased three picture frames that were the wrong size. I called to see what their "no receipt" return policy was and they told me I could only get 40% back in store credit.   I drove back down there to return the stupid frames. The checkout person tells me they can't take one of them back because I took off the plastic wrap. Well, of course I did. That's how I found out it was the wrong freaking size frame. I get to return the other two frames because after discovering the first one was wrong, I held the picture up to the other frames and realized those were wrong too. So the checkout lady says she'll give me 40% store credit for the two frames. I say okay. She makes a big deal of it and thinks I don't understand I'm only getting 40% back. I go off. I say..."I talked to someone on the phone and already know I'm only getting 40% back. I'm not happy about it, but I get it. Just hurry up and give me the store credit so I can leave and hopefully never come back."  Then I realized I'll have to go back eventually to use the store credit.   I apologize to retail workers everywhere. But when you're having a bad day, you're having a bad day. And people really shouldn't mess with me when I'm having a bad day.

      I've got that song "Suddenly Seymore" from  The Little Shop of Horrors  stuck in my head. Only I don't know the words, so I just keep hearing Suddenly Seymore over and over again. It's lame.   When I was in sixth grade I went on a trip to Washington, D.C. We were supposed to see that musical. At the last minute, the theatre switched the production to  Oklahoma!  I had that song that goes "O-K-L-A-H-O-M-A Oklahoma! O-K" stuck in my head for two weeks. When I saw the  Lion King , I had "Circle of Life" and "Hakuna Matata" (forgive me for spelling errors) stuck in my head for a month. I just saw a month or so ago  Mamma Mia  and had "Dancing Queen" stuck in my head for a couple days.   Other songs that have been stuck in my head include:   The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Music  I Feel Pretty  Beauty and the Beast  Just the DA.DA.DA.DA.DA.DUM music from Phantom of the Opera  My point is...musicals are a highly addictive drug with disturbing side effects. But I love them so.

      I was editor of the school newspaper when I was in high school. One of the perks of being an editor was that I could write editorials about any silly thing I wanted.   One issue I wrote an editorial about how silly I thought school dances were. I said something about how they were excuses for teenage girls to play Cinderella, get all gussied up and go out to dance. I went on to say it was a waste of time and money and that I could have much more fun going to Burger King and ice skating with my friends.   I had countless "normal" high school girls come up to me telling me they disagreed with my column. I said, "well, isn't that the whole point of an editorial? You don't have to agree with it." They didn't seem to agree, and one person refused to talk to me for a week and a half. What a loss.   Since then, I've realized that I have tons of opinions. Some I share with other people, some I don't. I really don't care if people agree with me or not...I say what I think. Some people might call me blunt, but I think it's what makes me me.

      I miss this show and am bitter that Fox won't release all the episodes on DVD, so I have to pay tribute with some McBealisms. These are not listed in any particular order.   "Whoever said that 'plenty of fish in the sea' thing was wrong. Sometimes there's only one fish. Trust me."   "I always know when people are talking about me. My left fibula itches."   "I'm actually luckier than most. I get to wake up each morning, glad to start a new day--grateful the last one is over."   "Sometimes I'm more persusasive when I lack conviction."   "I don't even like my hair!"   "Where does it say that women can't act like men sometimes? I saw a cute piece of meat and I said to myself, you only live once. Be a man."   "Don't even speak. I don't even want to know your name. I live across the street. I want to take you to a hotel room, take your clothes off, do bad things. I'll have you back in an hour. Whaddaya say?"   "We're women. We have double standards to live up to."   "You're supposed to be able to send your life to the dry-cleaners and get it back nicely pressed and folded."   "Even if I get past my problems I'm just going to go out and get new ones!"   "The only reason I look as young as I do is because I had the good sense not to smile growing up..."   "Today is going to be a less bad day... I can feel it. Sometimes I wake up and I just know that everything is going to be...less bad."   "My smiling license has been suspended."   "So here I am vistim of my own choices and I´m just starting."   "I don´t watch hockey, I think it´s cruel to the animals to dress them up and make them skate like that."

      Since when do college freshmen need their mommies and daddies to go with them to orientation? I work at a university, and it being mid-summer, the new freshmen (or ants as I like to call them, because when all the students are here, they look like ants when I look down from my office window) are visiting for orientation. Nearly all of them are accompanied by one or more parent.   My mom and dad did not go with me to my college orientation. Now, I've only been out of school for two years, so this change must be relatively new. The only contribution my parents made to my college career was paying the monthly tuition payments. I filled out the application, I registered for classes and attended orientation day by myself, I paid for my books, I attended classes, took exams and graduated basically on my own. Granted, without my parents' monetary contribution, I would not be sitting here typing this to you. And, yes, they must have done something right for me to be accepted into college in the first place. But that's where their involvement stopped. (With the exception of helping me move in and out what feels like a million times -- Thanks, Mom and Dad).   Anyway, so there are all these kids here with their parents. Like it's that difficult for an 18-year-old to go meet with an advisor to discuss what classes they should take. I guess they all need a hand to hold while they take a campus tour from a threatening student.  What's worse than all this is that I heard from one of the admission counselors that parents call him up saying things like, "I'm thinking of enrolling my son in the engineering program." Um, excuse me? YOU'RE thinking of enrolling your son? I thought that in this country, people were considered adults at age 18. So you'd think that the choice of what college to go to, what to major in, and even the decision to go to college at all would be the STUDENT'S. If my parents had told me where I was going to school, or applied for me, I would have been pissed. I'd be working at a movie theater or something just to spite them.  Maybe today's youth (haha, saying that makes me laugh and feel old at the same time) needs some extra guidance. Maybe they're incapable of doing anything on their own. Maybe their parents will write their theses for them when they get to graduate school.

      Last night on  Amish in the City , everyone got to go visit Whitney's hood. She's the black (oops, African-American) chick who lives in south central L.A. It was hilarious...they're driving in their huge, monstrous SUV through downtown. And everyone seemed to be tripping over how trashy it is. They didn't even go through some of the trashiest areas. My daily commute features neighborhoods far trashier than what they drove through.   Anyway, it was funny that the Amish kids were both amazed and freaked out by the stray dogs, trash in the street and homeless people. Personally, I am freaked out by the size of some of the buildings downtown. I changed my commute just so I will never get stuck in traffic next to a tall building when there is a major earthquake. I prefer not to suffer death by squashing.   Oh yeah, Ariel pisses me off. I'd like to take a slab of cow (or perhaps an entire skinned goat) and rub it all over her face.

      I'm supposed to be proofing the new catalogue website, but the site is all boogered up, so I'm blogging instead. It's probably good I have to take a break. The last few sections I gave her have about 500 post-its marking corrections to be made. A break will clear my mind and allow me to find even more errors when I start up again. Hehe. I love having an eagle eye and being so anal that I can't let anything go.   Anyway, I've decided that when I'm rich the very first thing I'm going to get is someone to do my hair for me every day. I can't dry my hair to save my life. It's so boring, holding a section of hair in the brush, trying to straighten it. I've already cursed my father for giving me this god forsaken wavy/frizzy/curly mess to deal with. I lack the patience to let my hair dry completely, I'm frustrated that my hair can be so nice and smooth after someone else does it for me, but such a freaking fro when I do it myself. BLAH!

      When I was driving to work today, I saw someone who, I swear to god, looked just like Larry David. "Larry" was going through the trash cans of some apartment/condo complex on Glendale Boulevard, right near Waterloo. It was pretty funny.  Right after that, I saw someone who looked like Albert Einstein (cuz of the hair) driving a Corvette. Maybe you can get away with having hair like that when you drive a Corvette...

      I don't remember driving to work again today. I didn't yesterday because I had an allergy/sinus attack and I decided I had more important things to do (like take Advil, sleep in, run errands)...  It's so hot out today. I walked over to the Village to get a Diet Coke, because this place doesn't sell them because they have a contract with nasty Pepsi. When I got back, I felt like I had gone swimming. The hair, which was straightened, is now a frizzy wavy. Ugh.  It's scary that I can't remember driving myself here. It means that I've gone from zoning out minutes of my commute to zoning out the entire half hour. It makes me wonder if people in hit and runs actually don't realize they've hit something because they're zoned out.

      This is what I'm reading now. It's a lot darker than the last one. I predict there will be molestation in this one. Just because the author, Gregory Maguire,  is dirty like that. The book is about one of the wicked stepsisters of Cinderella. It sort of tells the fairy tale from another point of view, usually from one of the bad guy's, but not always.   The last book by him I read was  Mirror, Mirror . Also dark, but only nearly dirty. The Snow White story is kind of sick anyway. It's just about a girl living with seven old men.  The first Maguire book I read was  Wicked , which I think is the best of the three. It is about the Wicked Witch of the West and her life.

      I'm trying to read as many books for pleasure as I can before August 23 when school starts again. I just finished  A Bend in the Road  by Nicholas Sparks, which I've had for over two years but just now got around to reading.   The damn book made me cry. That hardly ever happens with books. Movies, yeah. But the last book that made me cry was  The Awakening  when Edna swims out into the ocean and doesn't turn back. This book was about this guy who has a kid...and the wife was killed in a hit and run. He falls in love with the kid's teacher a couple of years later..and then he finds out that her brother was the one who hit his wife and ran. He ends up letting him go because he knows it really was an accident...almost shoots a dog...and almost doesn't end up with the teacher. Oh, it was too much. Now I have to read something historical or something to make up for the fact that I read a Nicholas Sparks book.

The article makes him sound like a bit of a sleaze though. Not the obit I'd want for myself. Of course, I'm never going to assault women. Men, maybe. But only if they ask nicely.

      I'm playing Literati against a co-worker today. The file I need to work on is lost in server pergatory and I'm having our techies try to find it. Until then, I have nothing to work on.   I'm a little peeved about the missing file, because if we can't find it, I'm going to have a crapload of work that's already been done to do. It's Friday and it's only 10:26 and I'm losing this game of Literati by 16 points because my last two words were three letters long.   I knew I should have called in "sick" today.

To all my friends who don't, you know the friends who drive them aren't reading this. They don't read my blog. To them, I'm a low-class human because I drive a Civic.  I have to go now. I'm going to dedicate the rest of this day to praying to God and the universe that they start enforcing this. As long as bonehead Arnold is running the city, that won't happen. I think an SUV is all that his over-muscled body will fit into.

      I have something else to gripe about today. Not really gripe so much as comment.  Last night, it took about an hour to drive 11.62 miles from Alex's apartment to LAX. It took me 20 minutes to drive 24.6 miles from LAX to my apartment. Yeah, it took me 1/3 of the time to drive more than twice as far. That's why L.A. is my own personal hell.

      This morning I decided to walk with someone from the parking center to work instead of waiting 20 minutes for the tram. When we were walking under a bridge, I realized why I usually just wait for the tram. Some stupid ass in a beat-up truck honked at me. I'm like, "you shithead!" It was loud and gave me a headache. The older lady I was walking with was like, "he likes you."   That never even crossed my mind. All I thought was, "what a bastard, I'm going to have a headache all day now because of him."   Anyway, I suppose if I was alone, I could have possibly been abducted, which would mean that I wouldn't have to be at work today, pretending to do work-related things when there is really nothing incredibly productive for me to be doing except look for the ziplock baggy of Advil I have in my desk. The desk with drawers that sometimes refuse to open.

So here I am, sitting around twiddling my thumbs, waiting for the rest of the pages. I'm glad I'm not in a hurry or anything.
