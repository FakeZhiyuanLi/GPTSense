      hmm  watching beholders videos help me realize one thing its also important to study and create new types of launches the gliding shoot is pretty awesome XD  from tamer brads site-"You treat this game too simple.  As I posted to old BD board, my son did well with Death Gargoyle MS against Wolborg MSs at last tournament. Here are cause of result.   1. My son is 6 years old. Youngest age to enter tournaments.  2. But he went to 2nd, 3rd stage quickly.  3. Opponent player guessed that my son must have well tuned Bearing Core based endurance type combo.  4. At this point, he showed his G-winder prepared grip, right spin.  5. To beat my son, same spin direction seemed to be best. Every opponent players selected right spin (most players were Wolborg MS).  6. Result. My son won.   Wolborg MS vs Death Gargoyle MS  A: right vs right  B: right vs left  C: left vs right  D: left vs left  For best result, my son had to select pattern "A". To do so, my son had to let his opponent select right spin. This strategy part decided result of my son's tournament matches.  Strategy, Combo building (and tuning), Launch technique. These three skills decide player's skill.   Please treat this situation as yours. What strategy will you use to let your opponent select right spin for his Wolborg MS ? Without this strategy, your good launching skill of Death Gargoyle MS is almost useless."  wow i never expected beyblade to get so much harder but its all worth it XD

THIS MACHINE Performed by Julien-K Music by Jun Senoue & Amir Derakh Lyrics by Ryan Shuck   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Verse 1 A shadow of myself, just who am I? Scan horizons A tragic mystery You could have left me here, sealed inside the pod No one would ever know - The chaos control My true identity The power that is me  Chorus We all danced in fire Trapped in this machine Don't know how long we've waited As the Eggman's watching We all danced in fire Looking thru the screen Don't know how long we've waited As the Eggman watches  Verse 2 With rouge in the fight - electric lives Change surroundings A jewel in history A treasure disappears - as she goes Miss her as you look away - and no one knows This power is a key This power changes me  Chorus  Verse 3 E-123 You didn't know - now I'm gonna show you The power that is me YOu try to take me down-stop the show Seems you've never tasted fear- or loss of control The power lives in me The power that is me  Chorus   FOLLOW ME Performed by Kay Hanley Music by Jun Senoue Lyrics by Mathilde O'Rourke   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Verse 1 Anywhere you want to go Anything you need to know All the best in life I want to get it for you Lately I just feel so fine I imagine that you're mine In my world you're gold I only want to protect you  Pre Chorus 1 Whatever I want, I get, and I want a shooting star Whatever I need, I have when I'm with you  Chorus Follow me inside, outside Through the stratosphere The moon is shining for you It knows that I adore you Suddenly all the sadness Will just slip away And you will see what I mean  If you just follow me in my dreams  Verse 2 I was searching everywhere Suddenly I saw you there And my love arrived Just in the nick of love Life floats on a movie screen You're the star of my scene We live on the edge of a knife Larger than life  Pre Chorus 2 Whatever I want, I get, and no one could take your place Whatever I need, I have when I see your face  Chorus If you follow me in my dreams  Chorus If you follow me in my dreams   TEAM CHAOTIX Performed by Gunnar Nelson Written by Jun Senoue & Gunnar Nelson   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Verse 1 Once upon a time you could be a bad guy And you'd live to see another day But now you'd never manage- boy, you'd be brain-damaged Just to think that you could get away  The power has arrived in a dream team A force where one and one makes three And when the trail's gone cold and the lies have been told This crew'll find what you can't see  Pre Chorus 1 Yeah danger hides when the hyper bee flies And the ninja stars fly too The muscle is Vector, the karma collector And he's sworn to fight for you  Chorus Team Chaotix- They're detectives you want on your side Team Chaotix- Their directive's tracking down your crime Come along for the ride The truth can run but not hide for long- the game is on... now!  Verse 2 Remember when stealin' used to be a good deal And when a crooked life would always pay? Well... Now that the teams in town that's all gone underground But it's a worry to this very day  A Challenge has been issued by the Eggman This mission's gonna need them all And though his hope's grown thin and their outlook is grim These three are gonna heed his call  Pre Chorus 2 Charmy's thing is dishing out first sting And the green one cheers them on Espio is clearly ready to go Run down who'd do you wrong  Chorus  Chorus 3 Team Chaotix- Sonic Heroes- what your problem needs Team Chaotix- Watch those three go make the outlaws bleed There's no way you can win If it's trouble you're in They're gonna kick your @#$%! Team Chaotix!

      WHAT I'M MADE OF... Performed by Crush 40 Written by Jun Senoue & Johnny Gioeli   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Verse 1 I don't care what you're thinking As you turn to me Cause what I have in my two hands Is enough to set me free I could fight the feeling To resist it over time But when it's just too much to take You sneak up from behind  Pre Chorus 1 Is it me, you say, you're looking for Let me show you who I am and what I'm here for... here for...  Chorus Try to reach inside of me, try to drain my energy Let me show you just what I'm made of Simple curiosity tries to take a bite of me Let me show you just what I'm made of now...  Verse 2 Like a million faces I've recognized them all And one by one they've become A number as they fall In the face of reason I can't take no more One by one they've all become A black mark on the floor  Pre Chorus 2 Is it me, you say, you're looking for Let me show you who I am and what I have in store... in store...  Chorus  Bridge You can take another life long try You can take another try...  Chorus

                 Well, you're a slacker.  Your greatest joy in life is sleeping, and you try to avoid doing work as much as possible.  Others are envious of your talent for skating through life doing only half as much real, actual work as everyone else.  You're an expert at talking teachers or bosses out of reprimanding you for your apparent lack of effort.  On the upside, you won't have to worry about things like repetitive stress disorder or high blood pressure.  Your life expectancy is probably pretty high due to this, not that you'll actually accomplish anything, you damn leech.           urlLink Be cool! Take the What Do You Want Out Of Life?

      Thunder, rain, and lightning  Danger, water rising  Clamour, sirens wailing  It's such a bad sign  Shadows of dark creatures  Steel clouds floating in the air  People run for shelter  What's gonna happen to us!?   All the steps we take, all the moves we make, all the pain at stake  I see the chaos for everyone who are we what can we do  You and I are the same in the way that we have our own styles that we won't change  Your's is filled with evil and mine's not there is no way I can lose   * Can't hold on much longer - But I will never let go  I know it's a one way track - Tell me now how long this'll last  I'm not gonna think this way - Nor will I count on others  Close my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do   OPEN YOUR HEART, IT'S GONNA BE ALLRIGHT   Ancient city blazing  Shadows keep attacking  Little children crying  Confusion, hopeless anger   I don't know what it can be but you drive me crazy  All your cunning tricks make me sick, you won't have it your own way   *Repeat   OPEN YOUR HEART...AND YOU'LL SEE...   (Guitar Solo)   If it won't stop, there will be no future for us  Its heart is tied down by all the hate, gotta set him free  I know it's a one way track - Tell me now how long this'll last  Close my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do   GOTTA OPEN YOUR HEART, DUDE!   * Repeat   OPEN YOUR HEART, IT'S GONNA BE ALLRIGHT

      Well, I don't show off, don't criticize  I'm just livin' by my own feelings  And I won't give in, won't compromise  I just only have a steadfast heart of gold  I don't know why, I can't leave though it might be tought  But I ain't out of control, just livin' by my word  Don't ask me why, I don't need a reason  I got my way, My own way   *It doesn't matter now what happens I will never give up the fight  There is no way I will run away from all of my frights  Long as the voice inside me says go, I will always keep on running  There is no way to stop me from going to the very top   It doesn't matter who is wrong or who is right   Well, I won't look back I don't need to  Time won't wait and I got so much to do   Where do I stop, it's all a blur and so unclear  Well, I don't know but I can't be wrong   This fight is not for anybody, this is purely for myself  There is no way I'm gonna give up 'til the very end  I can't tell what is wrong and what is right, I've got to find the answer  But until I do there's no way I will ever give up   Place all your bets on the one you think is right   (Guitar solo)   *Repeat   It doesn't matter who is wrong or who is right

      When the day is done, When the race is won, My life has only just begun, When you're next to me, So much more I can see, THere's nowhere that I'd rather be When I'm away from you, And there's nothing I can do, Do you think the same things too, When the time has come, I don't want you to run, You know that you're the only one,  All I need is you, for always and for ever, All you need is me, just listen when I say, All we need is love, for us to be together, 'Cos your my Number 1. All I need is you, for always and for ever, All you need is me, just listen when I say, All we need is love, for us to be together, 'Cos your my Number 1.  At the end of each day, Or whenever you're away, There's always things I want to say, But wherever you go, You will always know, That I've got so much more to show, You're my number 1 prize, When I look into your eyes, It's only then I realize. You're the one for me, There's no one else I want to see, There's no place I'd rather be.
