       Oh i just wish someone were here with me right now, to share this boredom that i posess. Summer is going to be over before i know it, these are my last days of it, and i am not doing anything. I am just sitting here wasting my night online, once again, and its so typical of my night. I want to do something thats perhaps different. Something that just makes me feel alive, becuase right now i dont feel alive, i feel quite dead, and motionless. I need something.    But no, tonight is not a good night to live, tonight i must babysit my little brothers, and make sure that they are safely tucked in their warm beds, and i need to make sure nothing unusual happens tonight. and that everything is comfortable in this house..      I guess it leaves no room for me to go out, and try something new. hahah. ahh what would i do anyways. who am i kidding???      any suggestions, on how to step out of the box?? any suggestions that wouldn't sacrifice my morals? haha... any? ah guess not.

       Well last night, Amy invited me to go to her old youth group up in Jamestown, New York. At first i have to admit, i really didn't feel like going, after a day of just laying around, and sleeping, and watching movies, i wasn't really motivated to do much of anything. I especially didn't feel a desire to go to a youth group, where i don't know anyone, and in which i wouldn't get home until like 12:30. Alright taking all of the cons into consideration, i decided to go anyways. I guess i needed to get out of the house anyways.      So yeah we went, when we got there, to tell you the truth it wasn't anything special. i mean YES they had some snacks on the counter and had some cool oldies playing. and people were dancing but, that's not really something i can enjoy to the fullest when i only know two people there. So Amy, Phil and i just hung out, and i was enjoying myself, meeting new people and what not.       Anyways this entry isn't about me meeting people, its strictly about what i remembered when i was there. We started the whole musical part of our worship, the band playing, the people clapping, voices lifted. But i wasn't feeling it, i was just kind of standing there thinking about.........everything i guess... I dont know if any of you know what i am talking about, but it's like when you are praying and then all of a sudden you find yourself thinking about something else or someone else. well thats what was going on. i was clapping and singing but my mind wasn't there, and either was my heart.      So onward the music went, and finally they played a song that i knew. I dont know about you, but you tend to appreciate songs more when you know the words, and you don't have to look at a screen to sing them. During the song i think it was "breathe" I looked around. and realized that nearly everyones hands in the room were lifted, everyones eyes closed. And i just thought for that second... Wow.... i've forgotten about the fire i once had...my drive to become the best christian i could.       it was all forgotten.       I realized i was living a lazy christian life.. Somedays i was on, somedays i was off. And as i stood there and thought about that, i just felt overwhelmed, my selfishness had just finally came back to haunt me....haha i'll have to say it was a little scary... finally noticing that i wasnt really where i wanted to be...      during that song, i lifted my hands up... and for the first time since creation, i felt the power of the holy spirit come over me, and i just smiled to myself, and comprehended the fact that i was back to the heart of worship. Hahaha, well right after some amazing praise songs, like "Let it rain" and someother great ones, i ran over to my purse grabbed a pen and paper and wrote down,     "Don't forget the feeling, your redeemer lives."      I think that piece of paper is going to stick with me for a long time, just in the times of discouragement when i don't feel anything. i can look at that paper, and realize I used to, and use that to encourage me to get on my feet again.      Idea- If you are ever feeling something wonderful, take a second and write down how you feel, that sentence or two can mean a whole lot for the rest of your life.

       Yesterday was probably one of the first times i sat down and had a devotion on my own. It felt really good for some reason, finally diving back into the book of life. Diving into something that actually has a huge importance to me. So anyways i did a little study thing on finding myself, and discovering my spiritual gifts, and being patient in waiting to figure out what they are.     &nbsp;   but anyways, the point is i think i am finally getting back on track. and i think for once in my "walk", i am not relying on a church or a youth group to get me&nbsp;to that level.&nbsp;i am relying on God to get me on fire not anything else, to be honest..     &nbsp;   AND thats something that really frustrates me there mere fact that&nbsp;people put all of their hope in their churches, and putting their faith in a pastor more or less then a God. Its sad to see a youth group fall apart or even a church fall apart, and then see everyone that was within it fall apart spiritually, and lose faith in what was the most important thing in the first place.     &nbsp;   I guess if you ask me, i think sometimes chruches can be brainwashing. They tend to tell you what you can and can not do, and they seem to judge you by the decisions you make. so i have made the decisions to step out of youth group a couple weeks, and find who i am in Christ on my own. and take the time to pray and have devotions on my own.     &nbsp;   SO i leave you with that folks, i don't know if you are spiritual, by any means but if you are : break away from the church, for a small amount of time,&nbsp;and challenge yourself. thats it,&nbsp;challenge yourself.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

        I think its time for me to give up on everything. I am so completely fed up with almost everything right now. and i am so fed up with actually trying to make things work, and trying to make things good. its ridiculous, i can't make things work, i can't make things good. and i think if i ever try to make things "work" or make things "good" i just get a slap in the face everytime. THEN everytime i DON'T try for something. or everytime i DON'T care about something its right there in front of my face, for me to worry about,&nbsp;and i have to think of a way to push it aside...and that takes pure outta control skill     &nbsp;   I wish SOME people could just make up there minds and STICK with it for more then a week, then hell we'd all be happy now wouldn't we? but of course thats not how things play out.. and once again i didn't play my cards right. and once again i have been forced to fold. for everyone who is super friggin dense that was an analogy. so here i am... again giving up on something that i have wanted for a while now.. and once again i feel hopeless with everything............... OH so hopeless...       LAST THOUGHT- GAMES SUCK.

       It seems like the more and more i push and strive to get what i want, the further and more lost i am when it comes to getting to the so called "finish line." Truth is, in life right now, what i want is not, by any means, anything i need. Its just something i want, and would love to have..It makes me realize how faulty i am in everything i do. I tend to let my emotions get the best of me, and only seem to look at a part of the depiction, when i need to be looking at the whole picture. I see only what i want, and what will make me happy, i don't take the time to look at the damage that would come along with all of this. Well i know recently i haven't looked at the cons of my situation at hand.     &nbsp;   I'm coming to the grand conclusion that, i just wish that i could understand people to a more advanced level. Try to understand what goes on through their minds. try to understand the purpose of the things they partake in. Ahh. i need to stop believing that i can undertake the impossible. the impossible??? is anything really impossible???     &nbsp;   i'll leave you all with that...     &nbsp;   &nbsp;"is anything and everything really impossible, or does the possibility lie within our ability to believe? "

       I have seen so many online journals, that I, myself, have been inspired to start one. I also wanted to start one just in case somebody actually cared to read my emotions and thoughts on whatever it is I want to write about. Maybe someone could get to know me better through all of this technology stuff.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I am just going to dive right in, just come out flat and say what I have been feeling this last past week. This last past week, has probably been one of the greatest weeks of my summer, aside from the kick butt time at creation. and aside from the amazing weekend at volleyball camp with Schmidt ( HA-HA that was a joke.) But anyways yeah, this week, has just been so... Good, for lack of better words,&nbsp;yet its been so completely confusing and frustrating. I don't know how many&nbsp; things I have thought about this week, and I am beginning to think that I am almost to my limit with emotions.     &nbsp;   It seems that I just want everything that, I am not able to have (according to a good friend named Raul) he says what I want is  borderline  impossible. The chances, that what I want are going to work are so slim that its almost a waste of time to worry about it. Raul also made another comment though, he says, where's the fun, if you don't go out on a limb to get what you want. Its just all the better that way. Okay so I am not exactly quoting him, but his words were to that effect.     &nbsp;   I have to hand it to him, that kid makes me think. Think about things that&nbsp;I have never ever ever took the time to look at. And that's shocking because I enjoy&nbsp;digesting everything, its who I am,&nbsp;and trying to figure out everything, even if I am 95% of the time&nbsp;futile. But anyways back to what I was talking about. It just feels like sometimes, I put in way more then I should, or I put a lot more hope in people, when I know I shouldn't. I just look around, and I don't see the problem. I don't see why things can't ever be "right", just purely right.     &nbsp;   I mean yeah sure I see the things that are going against me, I see the completely different lives, I see the completely different schedules, but that's all I see, and I need more right now. I need more of a reason then ,we're busy. I need a lot more then that right now. And I am not getting it.     &nbsp;   I am wondering if i should fight for what i think i want. or if i should just take a seat and realax, ONCE AGAIN,&nbsp;and wait until someone else makes a move. Ha- I don't think thats going to be happeneing anytime soon though. Wow. Don't i feel like a confused teenage girl. ARRGHH.       Okay I can't talk about this anymore, I am just getting more and more frustrated, yet more and more... Excited...Ha..Wow. I need a nap.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       Okay well this entry is only going to make sense to those who know me very well, and know a lot about my past, and a lot about&nbsp;my life before i moved to Cambridge Springs. So i guess if you don't really know me all that well, and are just reading this for the reason being you have nothing better to do. i just suggest you don't, i don't want to waste your time.     &nbsp;   SO, here we go, i was in walmart yesterday, me and my mom went, we had a few groceries to pick up,&nbsp;and a few other things that we just needed to grab,&nbsp;and i must admit it was a great night, we had a lot of wonderful discussions about a lot of "stuff" that was on my mind, friends, memories, the past, the future. It was an all round intellectual conversation if i must say myself, and ending the night with dinner, made it all the better. But anyways i am getting way off track. So me and my mom were walking down one of the isles and about taking hmm i want to say 2 steps into the isle, i looked up and saw someone, and right then and there, my legs just wanted to give out on me, except there was nothing to grab onto at the time, so i just looked up at my mom, and she was like "sara what is it" i was like mom turn around, without any questions she turned around, i think she knew, at this point, that something was seroiusly wrong.     Alright, so she turned around, and so did i, and we immedietly left the isle. I grabbed on to something, because by this time my legs had completely just failed to work. crazy? yes i'd have to agree, it is a little weird. I felt like i&nbsp;was having an anxiety attack,&nbsp;which&nbsp;i wasn't, but&nbsp;it sure felt like it. Its like that feeling when everything in your body goes numb, and you can't do anything about it, and you just can barely breath, yeah something like that. &nbsp;i bet everyone that saw me then and there in walmart, thought i was the biggest weirdo, do i really care ? no, BUT anyways, i don't want to keep you in too much suspense, so onward we go.     &nbsp;   My mom was seroiusly concerned by this moment, and shes like sara, what is it ? and i was like mom. "it's him" and shes like wait who, she took a few steps to the corner of the isle and&nbsp;glanced&nbsp;down not knowing really what to expect. and there he was     &nbsp;   &nbsp;Jim........     &nbsp;   SO uhh yea.. my mom looked at me. and was just like sara are you okay, and i was like.. yea..i'm perfectly fine its just.. whoa. and shes like you know what lets walk right past him, he is going to feel more awkward then we are about this, lets go.&nbsp;at first i completely objected with a "NO mom, i can't do that" and she completely understood. but then something in me was like what the hell, why not? what do i have to lose right now? so there we were me and my mom turning around, and going back. we walked right past him, he just looked at us. I was like "Hi" and he didn't say anything. nothing. after how many years. you would think that he would want to say something, anything out of decency. a "how are you" a "wow. hi" even&nbsp;a "hello" but no.. nothing.     &nbsp;   So since then, since yesterday, i have been just thinking pretty dang hard. just about why things happen the way they do. What my life would have been like with him in it, and then i just realized, its done its over... theres no reason for me to beat myself up about it anymore. it just happened so long ago, and when you see him, all the memories come flowing back, all the promises, everything. And it was seriously a huge shock for me to look at him with his "girlfriend" and his kid. It was merely painful actually.     &nbsp;   but yeah... i'm not a whimp i can deal with it     &nbsp;   life goes on......     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       Okay, I don't even know where to begin, camp venango this year was remarkable. It possessed its ups and downs, but the complete turn out of the camp taken as a whole really really shocked me. I left there with a new perception on existence, and on myself.  I am just going to give details on the last night at camp, that would be a Saturday night. Oh, wow, a frigid night. The air was crisp, the stars were brilliant, and there a hundred plus youth stood underneath a pavilion. A lot of lives were altered that night, I am assuming a lot of first time dedications were taken place, but for me and a few other people it was just a superb occasion to honor our God, and hopefully get back on track with our spiritual walks in Christ.  The thrill, for me at least, started with the splendid praise music, that kind of just hyped me up, and got me excited about the Lord. They, then encouraged us to break up into small groups, and just pray, implore to the designer of the universe. Okay, first off, if you need to know anything you need to know that I love breaking off into groups and praying. There's something about hearing people cry out from the floor of their hearts that gets me all anxious. So when they propose that we fracture off into small groups, I have to confess I was pretty darn excited.  So in the circle it was me, laken, Josh Mumau, Kaitie (chick from meadville), nathan (my little brother), Ryan Riegner, Tyler, and Raul. I think that's it, but if I am forgetting anyone, sorry. So anyways we got in our circle, and Tyler said that he needed prayer, of course we were all wondering about what, and when he started explaining how he has been absolutely numb to "God" this year, I couldn't help but feel really guilty. Because after all I have been to. I have felt like the biggest fake this year. Okay taking into consideration, I have had my points where I was entirely on fire for God, there was a lot more "spiritual ruts" this year. Anyways following that a few other people spoke up and were like, yeah seriously, I need something in my life.....  OKAY, so the praying began, wow, it was so amazing. Its not anything I can put in plain words. I have had people ask me "What does the presence of God feel like?" Well to be straightforward that is an unanswerable question. It has no answer. It has no words to describe it. Your heart races. You transcend, and its incredible. Seriously unbelievable.  So I leave you with this:    GOD is alive.
