      I am a self-confessed basketball freak.    There I admit it.    Ever since I first saw the PBA with all the Alvin Patrimonios, the Jojo Lastimosas and the Jerry Codiñeras on the boob-tube when I was about 11 years old, I have been hooked to this sport.  This has been the cause of the several verbal tussles that I have engaged with a certain dominant 5-year old in our house when in comes to what to watch on TV.  Back when I was in high school, I grabbed every chance that I got to record any NBA basketball game on our betamax.  That way I could view the highlights of the game over and over in the hopes of being able to mimic the moves of Michael Jordan at the concrete basketball court that our neighbor had.  In summer, Joel my younger brother and I would spend long hours in the afternoon playing basketball, most of time me coming out the winner.  Well, I was about 5'5" then and Joel was about 5', so the victories didn't come out as a surprise.  I doubt if I can still win against him nowadays since I've stopped growing when I hit 5'7" and he's now a lithe and springy 5'8"-5'9".  In college, I took basketball for my PE classes in second year and I engaged in a weekly basketball scrimmage with my fellow Junior Jaycees every Wednesdays at 9PM.  I was told recently that such scrimmages still continue up to this day.  I guess such weekly routines would eventually reap some rewards in future games and much to my surprise, it did.  When the Phil. Junior Jaycees Inc. Visayas Area Convention was held at USLS Bacolod in 1997, I got to be part of the team that would represent the USC Junior Jaycees in the sportsfest that was to be held during the convention.  There I was all over the court, leaping for rebounds, issuing crisp passes, harassing the opponent's lead scorer and had my lion's share of the scoring load.  But the one game that mattered most and was probably the one that I will never forget was the championship game.  I remember canning three straight heaves from beyond the arc to put away the game and give us the championship.  This was about seven years ago.  Nowadays, after having sustained two career-ending (if you call that a career) ankle injuries (heck I once had to go to college supported by crutches for a whole week because of one of these injuries, all the more frustrating was the fact that the College of Architecture and Fine Arts was located at the 4th floor of the USC-TC Building and the supposed elevator hadn't been running for a decade), I've opted to retire from such levels of competitive basketball.  But that didn't mean I've distanced myself from the game.  Recently, some of my high school batch-mates, who were the varsity players during our time, joined and won the Inter-Alumni Basketball Association 2003 Championship.  They did this without any funding from outside sources.  They took the fees out of their own pockets and joined the tournament that involved the cream of the crop of high school alumni basketball players from prestigious schools such as Sacred Heart, Don Bosco, CEC and USC.  Despite having won the tournament in fairy tale fashion (they entered the semis seeded last), they still had a hard time getting funding to join the on-going San Carlos Boys' High Alumni Basketball Association (SCBHABA)-Osaka Iridology Summer Cup.  That was when my best friend, Edward, called me to come in and weave a little magic, haha.  Him knowing my passion about the sport and my knack for being a fair organizer of events, we collaborated and came up with plans for me to act as the manager for the team and at the same time look for possible sponsors for the team.  To make a long story short, we were able to get funding from a former classmate who's now connected with petroleum giant Shell plus through some phone calls and a little luck, we got the nod from current Cebu City Sports Commissioner Jonathan Guardo(who's also a USC_BHS graduate) for funding and carry the name of Guardo Arthro.  Yup, if you have been reading the sports pages in the past few weeks, and have read in the local papers about the Guardo Arthro Shell Velocity '93 team that's been dominating the SCBHABA tournament with a 14-1 win-loss record, you've been reading about the team that we put up that almost didn't even get a chance to join the tournament.  I'm having the time of my life managing the team even though I don't get to play.  Getting to enjoy the camaraderie that is reminiscent of our high school days, getting to watch great games and most of all getting those all-important W's.  I may not be sharing the court with the players getting free from defenders, knocking down the outside shots, be the anchor of fastbreaks nowadays but somehow, the level of satisfaction is still there knowing that I am still part of the team, albeit on the sidelines.  Although just recently I was given the chance to relive the days of being a player on the hardcourt but that deserves another posting, hehehe.  God, I love this game.

      For the past few weeks, I have been hearing from my very beautiful, intelligent and curvaceous wife the satisfying advantages of having your own blogspot.  To have an avenue where you can voice out your thoughts and your rantings without having a wise-ass editor scream at your face to redo everything.  In the end, I told myself, hey why not give it a try?  I consider myself a decent writer and I also try to voice out my opinion in several ways, this could be a different approach.  I enjoy writing, be it composing a poem that would merit a grade of 95 in my third year high school english class to letting my imagination run wild by helping resigning colleagues compose their resignation letters that'll help them convince their superiors with tear-jerking bravado to really let go of them.  I made copies of my files from my hard disk from my last job and I was able to count about 9 resignation letters that I made for departing officemates, make that 10 if you count mine.  Back in college, when our architecture professors would assign to us a group plate(collaboration of ideas to come up with a single functional and aesthetically-appealing design of an assigned project), it was quite heartwarming to see classmates fight over who gets to have me in their group.  It was then in the later stages of college that the truth was finally revealed to me, aside from getting decent grades in our design classes, they'd often take me in because they needed someone to cough up the oral report that would usually accompany the project..whoop-dee-doo-whoohoo.  Anyway, I grew to accept such a responsibility that I also grew to love it.  Yet, there are also times that my brain simply refuses to process anything that would involve digging deep into my vocabulary to come up with an acceptable composition.  Fortunately, before I was enlightened to write this piece, I caught a glimpse of my beloved wife Emi, and my spitting-image Dindin lying asleep on our bed...there they were, the two most important persons in my life sound asleep in our rapidly-shrinking bed(by the middle of the night, our son would've controlled half of the bed while Emi and I had to contend with the other half).  Looking at them made me look back at all the things that I have learned to love in all my 27 years...all the things that I have loved that I have forgotten to do...one of which was writing.  Looking at them gave me the inspiration to do those things again, and this is why I am still up at 1:30AM typing away my thoughts.  This has been most satisfying...hope to do this again, just wish my brain wouldn't give out in the next few weeks.  Hahaha.  CIAO.

      SPIDERMAN  I have a big lump on my forehead.  Because of this, my classmates in high school came up with the proper nickname with which to tease me throughout the 4-year stretch in life with which we spend in immature nonsense and the incessant daydreaming of the fairer sex - high school.  My classmates used to tease me bukol because of this colloidal growth that can be seen on my forehead if you look at me closely...hey, come to think of it, could this be another reason why the denizens of STC, CIC and USC-GHS would stare at my way aside from my good looks?  Hahaha.  Anyway, back to the subject of how I was cursed to have such an imperfection on my forehead.  It’s all because of a certain superhero that has been giving the Superman moviemakers a ton of reasons why to produce such a movie and has been giving Stan Lee a million reasons to grin ear to ear - Spiderman.  My whole broods of siblings, save my sister, are comic book fanatics.  During our time, all five of us brothers probably had one of the largest comic book collections in Cebu.  The two older kuyas of the brood, Michael and Peter were fascinated with G.I. Joe’s and other war-related comic books while the bottom three young turks, Gabby, Joel and I had a diverse collection of X-Men, Transformers, GI Joe, Superman, Batman and my favorite...Spiderman.  I was such a big Spiderman fan that I would literally re-arrange our sala, much to the horrific look on my mother’s face when she saw what I did, everytime I got the urge to mimic a Spiderman adventure.  I never foresaw that one such adventure would forever become a permanent imprint on my life.  I could still remember that fateful Thursday evening (don’t ask me how I remembered the day, basta I was sure it was a Thursday, call it uncanny or whatever), we were preparing to eat dinner and I was my usual Peter Parker self playing around the house, knocking over imaginary Doc Ock’s, Vultures, Lizards and Green Goblins.  Playing Spiderman would never be complete if you didn’t get to scale walls.  So, outfitted with a two pairs of socks fitting snuggly my four extremities as my desperate attempt to at least look like Spiderman, I proceeded to climb up our window, grabbing hold of the metal railings when in a spectacle of terror and shock resembling that of the Sept. 11 WTC attacks, I lost my grip and proceeded to fall down, head first.  My forehead hit a corner of our narra table, which adorned our living room and opened up a 4-inch gash, spilling precious blood over my face.  I was immediately rushed by my mother and father (bless his good soul) to a nearby village doctor who, after injecting me with several doses of anesthesia (which, based on my bloodcurdling screams of pain, weren’t enough), began to work his magic by sewing up my wound, causing an even more severe episode of pain on my part.  Now, every time I see anything that relates to Spiderman, I am taken back several years into the past, to that fateful night to relive the memories of my vain effort to be the hero that I idolized.  Even though that event gave me my awful high school nickname, my stance on Spiderman hasn’t changed; he will always be my favorite.  I have never been one to see a movie on its first playing date, but ever since I heard about the release of the first movie in 2001, I made a vow that I had to watch it on the first playing date no matter the cost and grab every chance to watch it over and over again.  Emi doesn’t know this but on the first playing date of the first Spiderman movie, I declared undertime from my previous job just to watch the movie.  It was well worth the sacrificed pesos from my salary.  A year ago, again I made the vow to watch the sequel Spiderman 2 on its first playing date.  Last night, together with Emi, our 5-year old dynamo Dindin and our good friend Rene, I fulfilled that vow.  It was not easy though, riding on the coat-tails of the mega-blockbuster success of the first movie, the sequel already had throngs of followers that would troop the cinema ticketing offices as early as 12 noon.  Being a relatively new employee, a probationary one at that, in the leading mall corporation in the country, I didn’t want to blemish my record yet with an undertime entry.  So I had to wait until 6PM, knock-off time.  I had already been hearing stories that the cinema ticket outlets had already begun to stop sales of tickets for the movie by 4PM because it was being sold out already, up to the 9PM showing.  But I knew that couldn’t stop me, by hook or by crook I was going to watch that movie and what I wanted I knew I had the capacity to get it.  Our mall’s cinema serving the movie informed me that they had nearly sold out all the sure-seat tickets for the succeeding shows on that day and what seats were left were scattered across the cinema house, meaning we could watch the show, but we’d have to be separated from our companions.  What’s more, Rene preferred to watch the movie in another mall considering that fact that we’d have a better chance of getting a ride home there.  I then turned to a good friend of mine, a former officemate from my previous employer and inquired from her the possibility of reserving sure-seats for one of the evening shows in the competitor mall with which she was now connected with.  Unlike my previous employer, my current job didn’t stipulate it in the contract that I signed that they would prosecute me if I would go to a competitor.  Finally, a stroke of good luck...Mabel was able to reserve me four slots for an 8PM showing, and what’s more, she made sure I got four of the best seats in the house!  God bless you, Bel!  8PM, that means we had two extra hours allocated for transit mall to mall and have dinner at Gerry’s Grill, which had now taken the spot of the controversial Mi Vida bar in the competitor mall.  8PM came and we proceeded to go to the cinema house, my little boy wide awake after a 10-minute nap and anxious to watch the sequel to the Spiderman movie (I bought the VCD of the first movie and we’ve watched it several times already).  I myself tried to control the giddiness that was building up inside me.  There we were, sitting comfortably in four of the best seats in the house.  There I was, eyes wide open, watching the scenes that as a child then had so badly wanted to do day in day out in our house at Mandaue.  It was well worth the P360 spent, I can tell you that.  After the movie, all three of us adults had the same conclusion; this movie is well worth watching a second time (in my case, a third, fourth or fifth time would probably satisfy my cravings), which we plan to do next week.  Even if my Dain Angelo didn’t say it verbally, he really enjoyed the movie.  Why?  This is the first movie that we saw of which he didn’t doze off or had a temper tantrum pleading us to go home.  He was riveted to the movie, clutching with his cute little hands, the large bucket of cheese popcorn we purchased before we entered.  When we got home Emi and I still had a lengthy discussion about the movie before we decided to turn in.  While we were talking I began to pour out to my beloved wife years and years of knowledge about the superhero that I used to emulate as a child.  Who says we husbands don't have the capacity to impress our wives after a few years of marriage with what's stored in the pinkish organ that we call the brain?  Ha!  I'd say I made a big fan for Spiderman out of my wife that night.  Hehehe.  Our 5-year old little boy was fast already asleep embracing his already worn-out Pringles hotdog pillow.  If he only saw his dear young dad (yes, young) lay out a 5-minute historical oration of Spiderman, I'd already have received a standing ovation.  Hahaha.  We definitely have to watch that movie again.    I definitely have to watch that movie again.
