       \.Listening to "O Praise Him (All This For A King)" by The David Crowder Band  //It has been nearly a week since i last posted. I am getting to where i hardly remember anything now, and that is one of the reasons i began this blog. Wednesday is the earliest i remember. I went to Mary Grace's house that day and went to her youth group that night. I enjoyed it a lot. Their Church is so much larger than mine, and they have a whole lot more youth. They all went out to eat at San Jose's that night.   //I do remember what i did on Thursday, or at least i think it was. I woke up about 1:30 and got dressed and went to town. My SUV had been expired for over a month and i had free inspections for as long as i own my vehicle and free oil changes. That saves a lot of money. After getting that done I went to the mall and got a few things then rushed home. Mary and I cooked Scurby (my step-dad) some speghetti, a cake, and made some sweet, Iced Tea. It was great.   //Friday was awesome. I woke up around 1:45 and had to be at church at 3:45. We were departing at 4 and were on our way to see Michael W. Smith, Mercyme, and The David Crowder Band. The drive was like 2 hours and the van was packed. My favorite show was the opening band, the DCB. Awesome stuff. Too bad I could hardly see them. We had lawn tickets. For those not familiar with the Alltel Pavillion at Walnut Creek, lawn seats at FAR away, and we sat at the back of everyone in the lawn. To sum that up, they all looked like ants on stage. The projector screens kicked in around dusk, and we could make out what shape their faces were. Michael W. Smith and his band put out a nice worship experience. Im glad that I was able to go. We pulled in the parking lot at the church around 2:30.  //Today I mostly sat around the house. I am so dissapointed in myself. I dont think i have done anything physical today. Im debating with myself on whether i should play football or not. Im already kinda late because i havent been lifting any this summer, and ive told everyone that i would not play. Whether i play or not, Monday i am making a pact with myself to get back in shape because this body is doing nothing and is being drowned with Sun Drops.   //Tommorow is Sunday, and when it is Sunday, it is time to go to church. Waking up early for the first time in a week. AHH. Night yall.

       \.Listening to "Simple Man" by  urlLink Shinedown   //My weekend has been so long and boring. Thank God it has finally ended. I woke up Saturday morning like 4 hours before i normally do. It was around 8:30 or somethin like that. Then we left my house to see my brother in SC. I read my book on the way down there and finished it on the way back. That sorta passed the time by. That night was probably the boringestist night ever! My brother took me to this dirt track race where his boss was racing. Im not saying Sean is a redneck because he's not, but dudes that think they are rednecks need to check this place i went to out. There were women that had facial hair sittin on top of pickups drinkin' beer, and there was a whole race of white men wearing dixie outfitter shirts. I felt so out of place.   //My brother and I sat in the pit along with some friends of his, and we got to experience the race in.... well, a louder way. There was like ten different classes in which the cars raced in, and his boss raced last. I think we walked in the house around 2:45 on Sunday morning. I was awakened by stepdad who stayed at home and babysat the previous night. It was like 8 somethin. We didnt leave for another 5 hours.   //I had read about 150 pages these past two days. Before this summer, it was a rarity that i picked up a book and sat for more than 20 minutes with it.  The Five People You Meet in Heaven  is a great little book that i will probably read again and again. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels they need to know that their life is for a purpose. I liked it a lot and would give it five out of five stars. I picked up the Potter 5 book tonight and started reading it again.  //Need some rest. I am signing off for the night. ------

       \.Listening to "Hurricane" by  urlLink Something Corporate   //I spent the majority of my day at the North Carolina Dixie Pre-Majors Eastern Regional Double Elimination Tournament Championship Game. The two team were Columbus County and Brunswick County. These guys were good. They spend countless hours perfecting their game so that they may become the next World Series champs. Columbus County came away with the victory, and they are heading to Dallas, NC for the State Tournament in a few more days. After the game, i came home around 8:30.   //My phone connection has been acting very odd in the last two days. Ever since the storm yesterday afternoon, my satellite receivers have been trying to dial into DirecTV, and I guess they havent succeeded yet. My phone stays busy then it acts ok. thirty minutes later it does the same thing. i was very frustrated after spending an hour figuring out the problem, so i finally unplugged the three receivers. AHH, that probably made no since.  //Spent the rest of the night downloaded copyrighted things. Found a new site that helped my find more people to download from. So, im happy because i can download faster and more things. Right now, i am downloading 14 albums, 5 movies, and 2 games. I love Torrent files.  //I thought i was going to be leaving tonight to go to South Carolina, but it turns out that i am leaving tommorow morning. i had to leave a post. Its probably gonna be monday before i do it again. You guys are probably glad that i will be gone for a while. hehe. Yall take care. lata.++++++

       \.Listening to "Razorblades" by  urlLink Story of the Year   //Today makes another day that I awoke past the median. While in my youth, I choose to slumber in the dwelling place that i call my bedroom for extensive amounts of time. How I spend 11 hours of my day in this is unknown, but it is certain that i find peace. Surely this is hard to come by with my intense summer agenda. Sarcasm. I do seek activities to bore myself with. This assists me to pass the time by.  //The previous paragraph was a whole bunch of nothin, but it was fun to write. I woke up today around 12:14, and sat around for a while. I took a shower after laying in bed for another twenty minutes. I was renewed and felt alive. I grabbed some clothes picked up my guitar. I played it for a while and heard a noise that was not coming from my mouth nor my guitar. It was my stomach aching for food. I start a lot of sentences with i. I put my contacts on, grabbed my wallet and keys, and left for the Burger Hut. Oh how i love those cheese steaks. They are rather greasy, but my body craved for two of them and a Sundrop. Nirvana.  //Went to a friends house today and stayed for a while. Matt and i discussed a lot of subjects. Most pertaining to black holes, school, and electronics. Matt is my bud that i can talk to in my county about this stuff. He can relate to the situations i face when my master boot record has failed on me or when i need to flash my BIOS. He is a great guy.  //Went out to Hallsboro and to Whiteville to rent a movie to watch. Mary Grace and I saw "The Perfect Score." It was about these High School Seniors who wanted to break into the College Board building and steal the answers to the SAT. I still dont know how they got past security, but they did. I would give this movie 2 1/2 out of 4 stars. The acting really sucked, but the idea behind the movie was pretty cleaver. It gives me some ideas. hehe. If anyone who reads this wants to help me steal the answers to the SAT, IM me at thelastsnleft853 through AIM. I need a crew. It did give me a realization that i needed to spend more time with SAT prep books. My score isnt that great, and i need to raise it a lil more.  //Thanks again for reading this blog. This is number three i think. its really becoming habitual. I might not post until sunday night or monday night. im goin outa town to see my brother's family. Its been great. Im out. Night. ++++++

       \.Listening to "A Sip Of Wine Chased With Cyanide" by  urlLink A Static Lullaby   //Today has been eventful. I ate lunch with my girlfriend's youth group today. They are a crazy bunch. It's kinda hard to laugh with a group of strangers, but i got through it. The shimp quesadilla was on time. It was great. After that I spent some time with Mary Grace and then decided to come to my hometown with one stop light. I went to church, learned some stuff about evangelism, and came home and watched television. Great day. Ive been up since 11:02.   //I got some feedback about my first post, and i guess i need to address it now. The dates are right, but i am posting my blog past midnight the next morning. So, it appears to have the date of the next day. Its crazy, but im sure you'll get it.  //I didnt have any time to read today. Well i guess i did, but i was a bit lazy and found something i thought was more important to do. Still on page 56. I need to commit more time reading because i just feel like a bad person by not doing it. I just placed the book right in front of my moniter, so that when i am about to get on the computer tommorow or i guess you could say today, i would read instead of talking to my friends and downloading copyrighted things. hehe.  //I had an in-depth conversation with this girl from Fuge about my relationship with God. Her name is Brandy, and she told that i needed to wait from an answer from God. Ive been prayin for a while now, and ive been seeking a stronger relationship with Him. I think im no where near where He wants me now. i want to be closer and on a higher level with Him. Ive been waiting for quite some time now. I know He is working on it, and i know i will be there one day. I need you guys to be prayin for me.   //Another night here at my computer. I kinda enjoy this blog thing. Im not promising a blog every night, but i like writing and im sure there will be more in the future. I need to get some sleep. Its 12:45 so it is gonna say thursday but remember that im writing about wednesday. hehe. im out like a fat kid in dodgeball. PEACE

      First Blog i've ever written.   //My day has been great up until now. I came to create my first blog, and i hear crappy music in the background. I just turned around and found out that it was on my favorite channel in the whole world. Authentic Hip-Hop is what they labeled this show. HA! Enraged, I stuck my tongue out at Petey Pablo and turned the channel from FUSE to G4TECHTV. I feel great now, and i should be able to write without any distractions.  //A call by my girlfriend woke me up today at one o'clock this afternoon. hehe. I sat in bed another hour before i actually did anything. I love summer. I think i ate like a snickers snack sized candy bar. Bored out of my mind i went to the library and looked for somethin to read. There are conviniences to having a library a block down the road from your house. I searched for about ten minutes until i found this really neat book called  urlLink The Five People You Meet in Heaven.  Its great. Quick reading book. I'm on page 56.   //I rode over to a friend's house tonight and stayed till about 10 tryin to fix his computer. On the way home, a deer jumped out in front of me while I was going slightly fast down the road that had a straightaway for about a half of a mile. Not a problem though. He ran away before I even pressed the brakes. I got home a little later, took a shower, watched tv, and looked around on the internet a little bit. I talked to this really cool girl outa georgia. Her name is Beth Ann, and she gave me an idea of a Blog. I've been wanting to this for a while, and i hope ill keep it updated.  //But that is about it for me today. Nothing special, so i had to describe every detail. hehe. Gotta get some sleep for tommorow. I actually have plans. Im out. peace.
