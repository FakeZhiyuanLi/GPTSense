      We hear a lot these days about patriotism.  Frequently it's from Republicans, who feel that questioning the course of the war in Iraq on any level is unpatriotic and the equivalent of aiding and abetting terrorists.    Of course, they don't actually believe that.  Just look at their behavior during the Clinton years.  Sean Hannity, Tom DeLay, Bill Bennett, Rush Limbaugh--all these guys and their cohorts attacked Clinton relentlessly when our troops were in battle, claiming he only used the military to distract from the Lewinsky scandal.  They were unperturbed by the thought that they were aiding Milosevic and undermining our troops; their zeal to destroy Bill Clinton overcame everything else.  When the shoe was on the other foot, however, and our Dear Leader attacked Iraq after lying about intelligence and insulting the international community, any criticism was verboten.  Even fellow Republicans were smeared if they voiced the obvious conclusion that our soldiers have been forced to bear the consequences for the incompetence and contempt of the Defense Department.  To these guys, it's un-American to criticize a Republican president, but perfectly OK to attack a Democrat.    Party above country, always.

      Like so many other Democrats, I was excited when Gen. Wesley Clark entered the race for the nomination last fall.  Here was a guy who had it all--intelligence, experience, a proven record as a warrior and statesman.  He was valedictorian at West Point, a Rhodes Scholar, a Silver Star in Vietnam, and Supreme Allied Commander of NATO.  He defeated Milosevic without losing a single soldier.  And he was a liberal Democrat.  I had followed the "Draft Clark" movement for months, and in the last few days before Clark announced, I was optimistic about his prospects for winning the nomination and defeating Bush.    Then things went horribly wrong, right out of the gate.  On the day after his announcement, Clark told a reporter that he "probably" would have voted for the war resolution on Iraq.  Of course, he was giving a nuanced answer to a hypothetical question, but our conservative press seized on this and ran with it.  Then there were his personal qualities.  He could be competent and commanding on the stump and in interviews, but more often than not he seemed nervous, shifty-eyed, and unsure of himself.  I don't think this was due to Clark having anything to hide, but rather because he was nervous and unused to the atmosphere of a presidential campaign.  You can't blame the guy.  He was attacked from the start.  Countless draft-dodging chickenhawks, guys who would have fled to Toronto rather than ever lower themselves to serve in the armed forces, appeared to impugn Clark's remarkable military record.  Rush Limbaugh, that renowned defender of America, hinted that Clark was too goodlooking, even "pretty."    In the end, he fizzled out, despite winning in Oklahoma.  I hope Kerry doesn't choose him as his VP (he probably won't), simply because I don't want Clark and his family to be subjected to relentless assault by the press again.  He doesn't deserve it; as Gen. Barry McCaffrey says, Clark is a national treasure, and he doesn't need to make himself a punching bag once more.    But boy, those were the days. . . .

      Camille Paglia was once something of a hero to me.  When I first read "Sexual Personae," "Sex, Art, and American Culture," and "Vamps and Tramps," I found her work scintillating, stimulating, and challenging.  Her erudition and passion made me love her, even when I disagreed with her conclusions.  Not anymore.  Who knows what lies behind Camille's about face--the accumulating years of career disappointments, the thrill of irritating academic feminists, the need to be contrary?    Today, Paglia is a cheerleader for professional liar Ann Coulter, the Ilse Koch of the American Right.  She adores Rush Limbaugh.  She will accept nary a word of criticism about the conservative press.    But hey, don't get her started on Michael Moore!  It's clear that she deeply loathes him.  Coulter's doctored endnotes and unhinged rhetoric are neat, but Camille is "concerned" that Moore might have used artistic license in "Bowling for Columbine."    And Al Franken is a "whiner."  Why?  Because he states his political views with anger and wit.  When conservatives do this, they're great.  When liberals do it, they're little pillow-biting bitches.    Paglia has, apparently, fallen for the old GOP propaganda that all Democrats are extreme leftists, who pass their time reading Derrida when they're not cheering Osama and plotting the destruction of America.  Despite her formidable intellect, Paglia, it seems, is just a dittohead at heart.

      No, I don't smoke pot.  I smoke Blackwatch tobacco in Missouri Meerschaum corncob pipes.  I smoked a pipe when I was in the Navy because I noticed smokers always got breaks while I had to stay in the bilge, scrubbing away.  I positively detest cigarettes, and cigars seemed so . . . Republican.  So I bought a briar and some Mixture No. 79, but my enthusiasm eventually waned.  Now, I have rekindled the flame (very bad pun intended), and after shopping around, I was quite fortunate to discover the smooth, sweet, non-biting tobacco that is Blackwatch.  Everyone has their preferences, but I smoke for the taste and the smell, and nothing tops Blackwatch in my experience.    As for the corncobs, I like their look, their price, and the cool smoke you get from them.  Plus, they're durable.  And if they were good enough for Douglas MacArthur, they're good enough for me.

      If you caught Bob Woodward's interview on "60 Minutes" for his new book, "Plan of Attack," then you might recall the moment when Woodward recounted this admonishing comment to him from Dubya: "You move in elite circles."  Elite circles?  What's our Dear Leader's definition of "elite"?  Does it include being born into two ultrarich families (the Walkers and the Bushes), being the grandson of a US Senator, being sent to Andover and Yale just like dad and grandpa, having dad pull strings to keep you out of serving with the riff raff in 'Nam, being pushed through into the world's most exclusive MBA program despite desultory academic records, and then kept afloat throughout one's adult life by your family name and your dad's connections?  Does that qualify as elite?  No, of course not.  Voting for John Kerry makes you elite.

      Dubya talks a lot about "accountability."  Indeed, he ran on the concept in 2000.  But only a dishonest person would pretend that Bush has held himself or anyone around him accountable for the disasters that have been caused by his administration.  In fact, the only people ever held accountable by Bush are those who expose him as a liar (see Clarke, Richard; O'Neill, Paul; and Wilson, Joseph, among others).  The civilian leadership at the Pentagon is utterly incompetent.  Rumsfeld, Wolfie, Feith, et al., have so completely botched the post-war planning in both Afghanistan and Iraq that today our soldiers are paying the price in blood for a Defense Department that, quite simply, does not have their backs.  And what's Dubya's response?  No corrective action.  No one held responsible.  Just another $10 million or so on attack ads against John Kerry.  Imagine that.

      There can be no doubt that the attacks on America on Sept. 11, 2001 were a lynchpin moment in world history.  The images of the towers coming down and of the Pentagon in flames were beyond disturbing; they were indicative of the lust for death and the refusal to differentiate between America's citizens and its government that characterizes Osama and his ilk.  The results of religious extremism are never pretty, particularly to a freethinker like me, but nothing could be more bloodcurdling or infuriating than the sight of innocent Americans jumping to their deaths from the burning World Trade Center.  This was what Osama wrought, and I can think of nothing more worthwhile than hunting him and every last one of his associates down and killing them without mercy.    That's what we trusted our president to do.  And now, almost four years later, where are we?  We are bogged down in Iraq, which was completely contained and had nothing to do with 9/11, Dick Cheney be damned.  We have entirely lost the goodwill of most of the world, including alliances we've cultivated for decades.  With our invasion of Iraq, we have sparked a surge in terrorist recruitment throughout the Middle East.  And, after rushing to war with faulty and hyped intelligence, we have destroyed our credibility by finding no WMD.  The chickenhawks like to tell us about all the schools that are opening across Iraq.  Hmmm--I don't remember being told we were invading to improve the Iraqi public education system.  Do you?  We also hear about how wonderfully free and liberated Iraqi society now is.  For me, this is a tough one.  On a human rights level, despite the torture our soldiers carried out at Abu Ghraib, the toppling of Saddam and the end of his police state are the overwhelming positive result of our invading Iraq.  But again, we didn't invade to liberate the Iraqi people.  We invaded, ostensibly, to crush an "imminent and gathering danger."  GOP propagandists can try to evade this all they want, but the truth is clear.    We have been betrayed.  America has been betrayed by the likes of Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, Dick Cheney, Scooter Libby, Don Rumsfeld, and George W. Bush.  We have been lied to, deceived, and stabbed in the back.  This is moral clarity at its most transparent.

      OK, I'll start off with some background.  Some of you might be visiting this blog after reading some of my reviews at Amazon.com.  I get an interesting variety of responses from my reviews and lists; from conservatives, I largely get death threats, while liberals write things like "I loved your review!"  I've never received a neutral e-mail from anyone who's read those reviews.    For me, that's a good thing.  Watching the Bush administration wage war on America does not leave me with neutral feelings.  Watching Bush and his father's cronies steal the 2000 election from Al Gore, whom they smeared with the mainstream media's eager collaboration, does not leave me neutral.  Watching Clinton's extraordinary economic legacy being ripped to shreds by "fiscal conservatives" does leave me neutral.  Watching brave men and women die in an elective war undertaken by a corrupt, cowardly adminstration does not leave me neutral.  Indeed, watching America get assaulted over and over again by the men and women that are (ostensibly) supposed to be looking out for our best interests enrages me.  Today, the word "conservative" has no relation to its original meaning, at least in American political discourse.  Do "conservatives" blow surpluses and accumulate the largest debt in the history of recorded civilization?  Do "conservatives" think compassion means having your picture taken with black people, while exploiting prejudice against them to score political points?  Do "conservatives" attempt to change the Constitution for their own gain instead of protecting it?  Do "conservatives" think America is worth fighting for only if someone else is willing to do it?  The answer to all of these questions, obviously, is "yes."  At least in the case of modern conservatives.  No wonder Barry Goldwater took to calling himself a liberal. . . .  The modern GOP is simply unfit to govern.  In the rare cases where reasonable, honest people (e.g., John McCain, Olympia Snowe, John Warner, Lincoln Chaffee, etc.) assume prominent positions in today's Republican Party, they are instantly targeted for elimination by the ideological extremists who run the party.    Lincoln used to be the face of the GOP; today it's Tom DeLay.  Enough said.

      I have strayed from my usual pipe tobacco, the divine Blackwatch, and have been experimenting lately.  Vanilla cavendish was a bust, with a weird, artificially sweet flavor that revolted me.  I tried the famous Early Morning Pipe, which was, to be honest, some of the nastiest stuff I've ever smoked (I'll never take my tobacconist's advice again).    But my quest continues.  I bought an ounce each of Sunset Rum and Golden Hunny, and I was pleasantly surprised by both.  The Rum was mild, but pleasantly sweet; it burned steadily and needed few relights.  The Hunny tended to burn hot, but had a very nice taste and left a delicious room note.    Eventually I'll break down and buy the Blue Note I've been hearing about.  Everyone says it's the sweetest of all pipe tobaccos.  One has to order it from Germany.  Maybe next month. . . .

      Jack Ryan, the "conservative" millionaire Senate candidate in Illinois, dropped out of the race today after his unsealed divorce papers revealed that he tried to force his ex-wife to perform oral sex on him in front of others.  Lots of Republicans rushed to Ryan's defense, and his statement of withdrawal from the race whined about "cutthroat politics" and blamed the media.  Gee, this is interesting.  These paragons of virtue, the titans of morality--they all seem to be into kinky stuff.  Whether it's the thrice-married Newt's problems with adultery or Bob Packwood and Arnold Schwarzenegger's penchant for groping, all these guys seem to be into the same thing they condemn Democrats for.    I wonder what it's like to wake up every morning and look in the mirror, knowing that you are a liar and a hypocrite who tries to destroy others for the very same things you do yourself.  Henry Hyde--do you read my blog?  If so, please e-mail me and fill me in.

      Does Christopher Hitchens hate Michael Moore?  Is the pope Catholic?  (I was going to say, "Did Hitchens cheat on his pregnant wife and leave her for his mistress?" but I realized that most people wouldn't know that the answer to that question is also "Yes.")  Check out Hitchens' bizarre and neurotic hate-filled rant about Moore at Slate.com.  Hitchens, of course, hates all liberals, and does so fanatically.  This is a man so enthralled by the right that even Lindsey Graham, the revolting Clinton-hater from South Carolina, was annoyed by Hitchens' sycophancy.  But his attack on Moore displays his loathing for liberals at its most unvarnished.  Does someone want to tell me when Hitchens became an expert on foreign affairs?  It seems like only yesterday he was a literary critic with a drinking problem (actually, that would be the day before yesterday, since yesterday he was writing yet another nasty book about Clinton and was fast on his way to becoming Ann Coulter with a paunch and a British accent).  Now he thinks he's Zbigniew Brzezinski.  Call me skeptical.

      I made the mistake of clicking on a link that took me to a couple of pictures of Paul Johnson's severed head.  What can one say?  Words fail.  I will never do that again.  The people who did this are, quite simply, subhuman.  Word has it that they were killed today by the Saudis.  I hope it was painful.    It boggles the mind to imagine taking a knife and cutting a live man's head off.  It is beyond comprehension.  The things that human beings are willing to do to one another, that some even choose gleefully to do to another, are, to say the least, disturbing.  What a dark time in history we are living in.  Who knows what the future holds.  I just hope that we hunt down each and every one of the people who did this today and make them pay.

      There's a fascinating psychological profile of Dubya available at Salon.com.  It confirms what many of us have suspected, not just since the Iraq war but since the 2000 election.  Dubya is a weak little man, desperate to prove he's strong.  He has deep anger towards his father and is more than a little ambivalent towards his domineering, sarcastic mother.  He is conscious of his lifelong history of failure, whether as a student, an athlete, a soldier, or a businessman.  His rigid schedule and black-and-white worldview are attempts to impose order on the world, in which he has felt powerless and incompetent since childhood.  His habits of giving everyone funny nicknames and being harsh with his staff allow him to vent his hostility without exploding.  This guy is a punk.  Shocking, isn't it?  He has been given every opportunity one could have in our society, and has blown it every time.  He's the kind of rich kid in high school who makes fun of other kids for being poor.  He's the same person today that he was when he was 17, only now he's president.  Not since Nixon has such a bundle of neuroses and dysfunction sat in the Oval Office.  November can't get here soon enough.

      Yes, I realize the title of this post is rich with implications.  But I'm talking about pipe smoking; more particularly, the pleasures of the greatest pipe in the world: the Missouri Meerschaum corncob pipe.  We all know the corncob pipe is synonymous with Douglas MacArthur, who was introduced to it by Gen. John J. Pershing during WWI.  MacArthur made it famous, but other cob pipe lovers included Robert Frost, Mark Twain, Rudyard Kipling (who called it "the best smoke in the world"), Herbert Hoover, and Dwight Eisenhower.  (Yes, the last two were Republicans, but they're better than Tom DeLay.)  Even today, every Missouri Meerschaum is hand-made in Washington, Missouri.  Buying one is a small but worthy contribution to a fine American tradition, and smoking one is a true pleasure.

      Rush Limbaugh, social conservative, defender of morality, and stalwart champion of family values, today announced that he will seek a divorce from his third wife, Marta.  He reaffirms his place along with Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, Clarence Thomas, Ted Olson, Mitch McConnell, and countless other Republican titans of virtue by getting yet another divorce.  Don't get me wrong--divorce is a common thing, and we all know that marriages end.  But are these guys really qualified to lecture the rest of us on "family values"?  I think that question answers itself.    I'm so glad that we keep marriage in the hands of assclowns like Rush rather than give marriage rights to gays.  They might not take it seriously.

      Dinesh D'Souza, the extremist conservative "commentator" and former Reagan administration hatchet man, is now a CNN analyst.  Damn that liberal media!  Why can't a conservative ever get a break?  Anyway, Michael Berube (I'm to lazy to insert the accent marks) has written a devastating and revealing account of D'Souza's early days as editor of the Dartmouth Review, where he spent his time attacking blacks and outing gay students.  Check it out at www.michaelberube.com.  It's quite illuminating.  Is anyone surprised that, after such a promising start, D'Souza is now one of the most lauded and beloved conservative writers in America?  You have to acknowledge his ideological consistency.  How long before Andrew Sullivan rushes to his defense?

      We've all heard of the "Reagan Democrats."  Now we're hearing about the "Nader Republicans."  These are the extreme right-wingers who, alienated by Bush's expansionist approach to government and his unwillingness to exterminate gays, will supposedly flock to Ralph Nader in protest.    This would be kind of like Eric Alterman, alienated by Kerry's cautious stance on Iraq and his promise to cut the deficit, voting for Bush in protest.  Anyone buying this?  Anyone even think Ralph means it when he talks about it?  This is some of the dumbest stuff I've heard in the last six months.  This, as much as anything, is indicative of the contempt Nader holds for America.  Nader would never want to siphon even a single vote from his beloved Dubya.  He is absolutely determined that Bush will win another term.  It's his life's mission.

      Bill O'Reilly and other radical right-wingers are going crazy over George Soros' avowed atheism.  This must have been in the latest memo Ed Gillespie circulated: "Attn: Conservative Pundits.  Mention the fact that Soros is an atheist all the time, especially when you are attacking John Kerry.  Because all of our sheep think atheism is evil, they will associate it with Kerry and this will motivate them to vote in November and help us have four more years with Il Duce.  Thanks, Ed."  OK, maybe not.  But this is obviously a planned strategy, since they're all doing it together.  As an atheist, I would probably be offended by it if these "freedom lovers" weren't utterly dishonest propagandists.  It's still illuminating, however, because it shows that people can't be public atheists without taking heat for it.  Well, I'll take the heat.  I don't believe in any god and I don't apologize for it.  It's my right.  Prejudice against atheists is out of control.  O'Reilly calls Soros a "crusading atheist"; when was the last time he attacked Richard Mellon Scaife for being a "crusading Christian"?  Never, of course.    Thomas Jefferson was an atheist.  Does Bill O'Reilly hate him?  What about Francis Fukuyama, who describes himself as an atheist?  Hmmm--I guess it's OK if you're a conservative.

      If you've been watching the polls, you'll notice that Kerry continues to lead Bush in virtually all of them (I haven't checked Fox News', but I can guess what it says).  Bush has the scent of blood about him, and I don't mean the blood of the U.S. soldiers that have been killed so that Cheney could nail a big contract in Iraq for Halliburton.  The blood I'm talking about is from the wounds (all self-inflicted) that are dragging this president down.  The public is looking at him and seeing a liar, a radical, a failure, and a buffoon.  Republicans are fleeing in droves.  Democrats have never more united.  Independents are revolted by this authentically evil man.    What does all this mean?  That Dubya is going to taste defeat, in a big way, in the fall.  And there's nothing Jeb can do about it this time.

      Well, it's over.  Ronald Reagan died today at 93, and soon the conservative propaganda machine will be in overdrive.  We are all supposed to believe that Reagan was the greatest president in our nation's history, that he ended the Cold War, that he was a man of principle, etc., ad infinitum, ad nauseum.    I beg to differ.  "Mr. Deficit" had a serious lying problem (ever heard of the "Welfare Queen," folks?  She never existed); he cut taxes for the rich and expanded spending, leading us into a serious debt that would be exceeded only by his disciple, Dubya; he waged blatant war on minorities, the elderly, and the middle and lower classes; and he let his administration be run by extremist ideologues like John Poindexter, Oliver North, and James Watt, to name but three.  Many of the wackos who pull Dubya's strings cut their teeth as radical conservatives under The Gipper.    As a Pat Moynihan Democrat, I can acknowledge the positive aspects of his anti-communism; apart from that, the man was a bundle of platitudes and little else.  But, compared to Bush II, he looks like Winston Churchill.

      One thing that's been nice to see in the last two years is the fury and passion demonstrated by some of the Senate's senior Democrats as they, virtually alone, stood unbowed against the Bush administration.  Frank Lautenberg, who earned a place on Nixon's "Enemies List" in 1972 for donating $90,000 to George McGovern, has been relentless in his truthtelling about the criminality of the Bush regime.  His recent "chickenhawk" speech was brilliant--and necessary.  Frank might be 80, but he's still the very epitome of the "fighting liberal" he always was.  Ted Kennedy has also been invaluable.  One thing about Ted, who, by common consent, has one of the greatest legislative records of any U.S. Senator in history, is that he is never bothered by the Republican attacks he's received over the decades.  Remember his stand against Robert Bork.  He took the initiative there and he's been doing it now, fearlessly calling out the Bushies for abuse after abuse.  And his recent smackdown of the usually decent John Warner at a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting showed he's not going to be bullied by anyone.  And finally, there's Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia.  He's been in the Senate since 1958 and is now its most senior member.  He has opposed the Iraq war since the beginning, and has done so with an eloquence and erudition that is all but extinct in politics today.  He has articulated the dangers posed by the current administration when most were afraid to do so.    These guys were in out in the wilderness in late '02 and early '03, when many of their fellow Democrats were meekly cowering in terror of our Dear Leader.  They have done their country a great service.

      Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France" (1790) is one of the classic works of conservative political philosophy. Among other things, Burke limns the importance of tradition, the gradual evolution of systems of government into more enlightened forms, and the dangers of radicalism.  He writes with common sense and passion, and this book is a must-read for people of any political persusasion, particularly in these troubled times.    For here we see how far the GOP, which is nominally "conservative," has drifted from that which the term was originally coined to describe.  From pushing for the Patriot Act to tweaking the Constitution; from unlawful arrests to denying prisoners the right to a fair trial; from illegally diverting funds without Congress' authorization to outing covert CIA agents for revenge; from destroying our traditional alliances to forcing our military to pay the consequences for the Defense Department's incompetence, the Bush administration and the modern Republican Party which supports it is so far from true conservativism that one shouldn't even be forced to point it out.    "I am incapable . . . of keeping terms with those who profess principles of extremes; and who under the name of religion teach little else than wild and dangerous politics."  Well, I guess that makes me a Burkean conservative.

      Joe Lieberman has the ability to get on his fellow Democrats' nerves like virtually no one else.  Okay, maybe Zell Miller is worse, but since he is a nonperson here, we won't get into him.  Lieberman's unctuous manner of speaking, his sanctimonious criticisms of his fellow Dems, and his cheerleading for the war in Iraq (not to mention his friendship with Bill Bennett) make him suspect to a lot of liberals.  Not to me, however.  I think if you look at Joe Lieberman, you see where the Democratic Party is heading.  Lieberman, despite the shortcomings of his personality, is a deficit hawk, pro-defense, pro-environment, and economically liberal.  He can be annoying on social issues, but then again, I've never heard him utter a smear against gays.  He is a Clinton Democrat, and in him one can discern a lot of the things that have made the Democratic Party so successful since 1992 (at least in presidential elections).    His stances show how much the mainstream Democratic Party has evolved, at least in terms of widespread public perception.  The Republican Party is now no longer considered the party of fiscal responsibility.  It is, indeed, perceived as reckless with the government's money, deficit-crazed, and profligate in its spending.  This new turn of events, which began with Reagan and Bush I but were solidified under Dubya, undercuts what has been one of the Republicans' great selling points ever since the New Deal.    On the issue of the military, the disastrous betrayal perpetuated by the Bush administration, which is clearly contemptuous of military values and military families, has sparked a new appraisal of the Democrats as the party of a strong defense.  The criticisms of the Bushies by numerous former generals doesn't hurt, either.  Wesley Clark's candidacy, despite the success of the GOP propaganda machine in painting him in a negative light, and John Kerry's record as a war hero, when constrasted with the chickenhawks who infest every level of the Bush regime, indicate a turning tide on this issue for Democrats.  Lieberman can be seen as an exemplar of these changes.  That's why I find him valuable, even when he's saying things as incredibly stupid as his comments at the Abu Ghraib hearing.  I wish someone would have said, "Yes, Joe--the terrorists who committed 9/11 never apologized.  But we're not terrorists, and they are not the yardstick by which we measure ourselves."  Alas, no one did.

      A certain famous gay conservative posted a few thoughts this morning about how upset gay Republicans have been since Bush and Co. trotted out the anti-gay marriage constitutional amendment to score points with Bible-thumpers.    One must be a little amused by this.  Are gay Republicans blind and deaf?  Did they not hear Pat Buchanan's 1992 speech at the Republican National Convention?  Have they not heard Bill Kristol encourage Republican politicians to target gays for political capital?  Have they not heard Pat Robertson say gay men have to wear diapers due to their "passion for anal sex"?  Have they not heard Bill Bennett call homosexuality a "deathstyle"?  Do they not realize that Jeff Sessions and Rick Santorum ARE the Republican Party, and that any gay Republican will be marginalized and even mocked within the GOP?  One has to wonder what planet these people are living on and how many years they are going to spend whining about how mean their party is to them.  Perhaps some of them will wake up.  Perhaps not.

      Is it possible to believe in a strong defense, balanced budgets, and rational patriotism while also believing in progressive taxation, abortion and gay rights, and environmental regulation?    Yes, it is.  Look at the Democratic Party as reconfigured under Bill Clinton.  A reverence for the best things about America--freedom, individuality, initiative, the democratic process--combined with an activist but responsible federal government.    Conservatism, as handed down by the likes of Edmund Burke, has nothing to do with the radically reactionary GOP, which will meddle with the Constitution at the drop of a hat and believes that arresting homosexual adults for mutually consensual acts is a good idea.    Anyone who seeks short-term political gain by trifling with the central document on which our republic hinges cannot be called "conservative."  These people are radicals.

      Stephen F. Hayward, a professional conservative hatchet man, has written a new book that will be remembered for decades as one of the towering works of modern political biography.  "The Real Jimmy Carter: How Our Worst Ex-President Undermines American Foreign Policy, Coddles Dictators, and Created the Party of Clinton and Kerry" (now there's a subtitle for you) is yet another lie-filled screed to warm the hearts of dittoheads across the land.  Boy, that Jimmy Carter sure hates America!  Carter has been a punching bag for conservatives for a quarter of a century now.  They like to pretend that he was a liberal, a weakling, a disaster as a president.  Anyone with even the most elementary knowledge of American history in the late 20th century knows better.    Carter was neither a liberal nor a conservative.  This is part what made him vulnerable to equally ferocious attacks in 1980 from both Ted Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.  The myth that he was weak on defense can only be taken seriously by the likes of Sean Hannity or Hannity fans.  With SecDef Harold Brown, Carter began a massive military build-up beginning in early 1979.  And in foreign policy, show me another American president since Truman who has left a legacy as monumental as the Camp David Accords.  Carter inherited a weak economy from Ford (who inherited it from Nixon, under whom it began in 1973) and a nation traumatized by Watergate.  He tried to be a different kind of president--honest, unassuming, and less remote.  Jimmy wasn't an arrogant guy, though he had much to be arrogant about.  He graduated from the Naval Academy and served in nuclear submarines in the 1950s.  No other president shares those distinctions.  Perhaps most notably, Jimmy is that rare Christian who exemplifies the best things about his faith, unlike Dubya, whose idea of religion is unabashed social Darwinism and dirty politics.  History knows better than the Republican propaganda machine, and it will be very kind to Jimmy Carter.

      Check out Rush Limbaugh's website.  I do from time to time, just to see what America's highest-paid liar is up to.  He has an unintentionally hilarious picture of himself, just above the link to his Time magazine interview, in which he seems to be trying to look "sexy."    Note the George Hamilton tan, the provocatively open shirt, the "slap me in the mouth and tell me I'm a bad boy" eyes.  Not since Carl Schmitt has radical conservatism been this hot.

      Anyone familiar with the work of Christopher Hitchens, master self-promoter and lapdog of Lindsey Graham, might also be interested in the writings of his equally publicity-hungry brother, Peter.  Unlike Chris, Pete decided to stay in the UK, where he has established himself as the Ann Coulter of British political commentators.    I finished his best-known work, "The Abolition of Britain," last night, and after reading nearly 400 pages of Hitchens' insane ranting and conspiracy theories about the decline of Britain, I came to the conclusion that nothing is more symptomatic of this decline than the fact that this book was a bestseller there.  Hitchen's "arguments" can be summed up succinctly: Britain has become a land of soft, whiny bitches (with the exception of Peter Hitchens); Margaret Thatcher was great, but maybe a little too liberal; Tony Blair and the Labour Party are a bunch of Maoist conspirators, determined to destroy the UK; and Princess Diana's funeral sucked.  If you've read Coulter's "Treason" or "Slander," then you get the picture.  Hitchens, like his brother, is a former Trotsky fan, and he pretends that his experiences as a Marxist agitator give him special insight into the machinations of Blair's Labour Party (get it?).  His book is little more than a neurotic inventory of everything about modern society that Peter Hitchens hates--and that doesn't leave much out.  If only everyone could be as patriotic as Pete, then Britain would be great again.  Maybe Napoleon had a Peter Hitchens complex.  In addition to its embarrassingly stupid argumentation, "The Abolition of Britain" is written in some of the sloppiest prose you'll read this year.  It seems hastily written, as indeed it was.  Blair was elected in 1997, and Hitchens' book appeared in 1999.    Some people are extremists by nature.  One must wonder about the intellectual seriousness of people who go from radical leftists to equally radical conservatives.  David Horowitz has a similar story to tell.  In both cases, however, the authors' invective overcomes their ideas.

      Democrats around the country should be pleased to hear that Stephanie Herseth has won Bill Janklow's seat in South Dakota.  This bodes well for a Daschle win in November, and is the second straight special election won by a Democrat this year.  Interestingly enough, the other (Ben Chandler in Kentucky) was also in heavily Republican territory.  Anyone else see a blowout for the Democratic Party in the fall?

      Andrew Sullivan has posted yet another of his whiny diatribes about the New York Times at his website this morning.  One would think that a journalist as rich and successful as Sullivan would find it unbecoming to launch vicious personal attacks on his former bosses over and over again, but not our Andy.  It doesn't embarrass him at all.  He loves playing the victim.  Sullivan has complained relentlessly about how mean Howell Raines was to him when he worked for Raines at the Times.  In his latest assault, he tries to wrap his whining in populist terms.  He pretends that Raines is an elitist liberal (have any of you heard this routine before?), and that Sullivan, staunch conservative and defender of the common American, was a target who suffered needlessly because he loves America and Raines hates it.  So Andy took a blow for the common man.    I'm not buying it.  No jounalist in America moves in more elite circles than Sullivan.  This is a guy who spends his evenings "chez Hitch" (his term) in mutual congratulatory adulation with his fellow liberal-hating expatriate Brit, Christopher Hitchens.  The only relation these two have with your average American is that they support sending them overseas to die for the Bush administration.    Sullivan can be a penetrating and intelligent writer, when he isn't consumed with pettiness and score-settling.  I recently finished his "Love Undetectable," and it was a moving book, beautifully written and argued.  It almost made me see Sullivan as more than an insufferably smug, self-aggrandizing, censorious hypocrite, until I read such penetrating work as his recent essay, "Bush's Comeback?"  This is a guy so determined to be right that he will not acknowledge anything that goes contrary to his hero-worship of George W. Bush.  In fact, the only thing that bothers Andy about Dubya is when the latter starts messing around with gay rights.  Bush can cost us millions of jobs, shatter our alliances, destroy our military, stop stem cell research, limit abortion rights, lie about WMD--anything he wants, as far as Andy is concerned, except limit the rights of gays.  What can one say about a "thinker" who only cares about things that affect him?  Remember what Andy's other hero, Margaret Thatcher, once said: "There is no society; there are only individuals."  Maybe that's Andy's philosophy after all.

      Yes, there are some.  I respect conservatives who have strong views but don't descend into smearing and lying about their opponents to further their cause.  In the old days, there were people like Everett Dirksen and Hugh Scott in the Senate, and Gerald Ford in the House.  Thomas Dewey was an honorable man, as was Ike.  They didn't go along with the character assasination that marked the careers of Joe McCarthy and Richard Nixon.  Barry Goldwater hated the religious extremists that took over the party after Reagan won, and Earl Warren proved that even Republicans could be extraordinary public servants.  Today, this breed is increasingly rare, almost extinct.  The GOP is now the party of Rick Santorum.  But there are some good ones out there.  In the Senate, John McCain, Chuck Hagel, Dick Lugar, Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins, and Lincoln Chaffee come to mind (note that the last three are targeted for liquidation by the wacko Club for Growth).  They are conservatives, but they don't make the agenda of the extremist wing of the Republican Party their religion.  The same is true of Virginia Senator John W. Warner.  Warner was first elected in 1978, and back then he was chiefly known as Elizabeth Taylor's seventh husband.  But he was also a Navy and Marine Corps veteran, and served as Secretary of the Navy for President Nixon.  If he was considered a dilettante when he arrived in the Senate, Warner has since proven himself an authentic conservative with an independent streak, an honest man with strong principles who puts his country first.  This is evident in his recent hearings on the Abu Ghraib abuses.  Warner was clearly giving Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz the benefit of the doubt, but his stern manner and refusal to cower before the Bush administration once more demonstrated that Warner is a man of courage, one of the few modern Republicans who shows a commitment to decency and tradition.    How long before the Club for Growth calls for his head?

      Tim Johnson caused a stir last week when he referred to the "Taliban wing of the Republican Party" at a campaign stop in South Dakota.  Prominent Republicans pretended to be offended, shrieking that they were being impugned by the senator.    Of course, they left some things out.  They forgot to mention that they ran ads against Johnson during his 2002 re-election campaign that placed Johnson's picture with pictures of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.  And that they compared a vote for Johnson with a victory for al-Qaeda.  You know, little things like that.  Johnson was doing nothing more than telling the truth.  Extremists run the Republican Party, from Tom DeLay and Mitch McConnell to Dick Cheney and Karl Rove.  These are people who are motivated by ideology, a peculiar ideology that operates out of contempt for the common American, a loathing for our Consitution, and the desire to transform America in their own image.    As I mentioned before, these people are anything but conservative.  They have no respect for tradition, they are not motivated to preserve our valued institutions, they detest the democratic process, and they have no reverence for the law, let alone common decency.  And they make very little effort to pretend otherwise.    They thrive on smearing and mocking their opponents, whom they paint as elitist and dishonest, rather than addressing real issues.  They simply do not like America as it is.  They are determined to change it, whether that requires stealing presidential elections or lying to its citizens.  Whatever it takes, they are determined to prevail.  I think we've yet to see the extent to which they are willing to go in order to win.

      Who is more qualified to assess the military situation in Iraq?  "Conservative" commentators like Andrew Sullivan, Christopher Hitchens, Charles Krauthammer, David Brooks, John Podhoretz, et al., like to paint largely rosy views of the state of Iraq.  They consider themselves experts on foreign policy, though they consist of a former New Republic editor, a failed literary critic, a psychiatrist, an English B.A., and a socialite who's clung to his dad's coattails his entire adult life.  Compare their collective expertise to that of Anthony Zinni, Wesley Clark, Eric Shinseki, Brent Scowcroft, Colin Powell, Joseph Wilson, and countless other former generals and experts on foreign affairs, all of whom think the war on Iraq was a stupid idea to begin with and badly executed to boot.  I think I'll side with the real experts.

      I see a lot of hardcore College Republicans around my hometown.  They all have gel in their hair and major in business.  They all look like they've wanted nothing more than to get an MBA and drive a Mercedes since they were five.  They all talk a lot about patriotism and "resolve."    But not one of them has seen fit to join the military.  Not one.  They say we are in a battle for the future of freedom throughout the world, that America itself is at stake.  But what sacrifices have they made?  None that I can see.  These guys are all pro-war, but only if other people are going to fight it.  You can see that same philosophy in the congressional Republicans.  With the exception of John McCain, John Warner, Chuck Hagel, and a few others, an overwhelming majority of the chest-beating, superhawk Republicans that wrap themselves in our flag every day have never even considered serving their country in the most honorable way possible.  Dennis Hastert?  Nope.  Tom DeLay?  Nope.  Bill Frist?  Nope.  Mitch McConnell?  Nope.  Saxby Chambliss?  Hell, no.   Are you seeing a pattern here?

      If his managing of the Emperor of Iraq over the last 12 months is any indication, then the answer is "no."  Bush has thrashed around over and over again, trying desperately to regain the upper hand, trying everything his puppet-master can think of to make him appear in control, but nothing has worked.  With the exception of the capture of Saddam Hussein, which briefly bounced Dubya back up in the polls, it has been one long, steady, unstoppable slide.  Why?  Well, Iraq is the most obvious answer.  After Tommy Franks' brilliant defeat of Saddam (who, let's be honest here, folks, was not the world's most formidable military adversary), the deceit behind the entire endeavor became clear.  There was no more hiding it.  There were no WMD and we were not greeted as liberators.  Virtually everything we were promised about what would happen in Iraq after we won has proven false.  So Karl tries plan after plan to help his puppet.  He has Dubya deliver prime time speeches, but these don't help (sometimes they even hurt).  He has his boy go on "Meet the Press" with Democrat-hater Tim Russert, but even Tim's softball questions couldn't help Bush structure a coherent sentence in the English language, let alone an intelligent defense for his policies.  He has Dubya promise to send us to Mars, one of the truly stupid PR maneuvers of any modern presidency.  This flopped, and has never been mentioned again.  And all of Karl's lectures to Dubya about "sticking to principle" have, in the end, backfired, as Bush is now widely seen as an incompetent, cocky punk who doesn't change plans even if it means disaster for America and its soldiers (not that the latter meant anything to our Dear Leader in the first place).  So here we are--Bush is freefalling in the polls, headed for what looks more and more like certain defeat.  Maybe Karl isn't the boy wonder we thought he was.  Oh, yeah--didn't he also lose the 2000 election?  Hmmm. . . .

      Say what you will about Dubya (and I have a lot to say), there's one thing everyone can agree on: he has done more to unite the Democratic Party than any other Republican president since Herbert Hoover.  All the old infighting, the turf battles, the squabbling, the disagreements over ideological purity--all the things that have hampered Democrats over the years are out the window.  We are now united with one goal: to defeat the most disastrous president since Ulysses S. Grant.    These are truly dangerous times.  Bush has assaulted the trust of the American people, he was waged war on the middle and lower classes, he has nearly bankrupted our country, he has turned the White House into corporate headquarters, he has abused our military, and he seems intent on undermining anything that protects the environment.  On every level, Bush has been a genuine failure as a president.  And that's being generous.  All this has made Democrats focused.  And this is paying off.  If the polls are any indication, John Kerry--a candidate I happen to like, even if I'm in the minority--has a better-than-good chance of defeating Bush, whose approval ratings have collapsed to levels that have historically spelled defeat for incumbent presidents.  I think the unity of Democrats started in 2000, when Antonin and the boys stole the election in Florida.  This shocking event, unprecedented in American history, did more than ensure that the reputations of Scalia, Rehnquist, Thomas, O'Connor, and Kennedy will forever be tarnished as corrupt and unworthy.  It showed everyone, even gleeful Republicans, that powerful conservatives were willing to do anything to gain power.  After eight years under Clinton, the GOP felt a sense of entitlement when it came to the presidency.  They would have it, even if it meant undermining a national election.  Does anyone doubt that they will try something again?  That even if means stealing hundreds of thousands of votes through electronic voting machines, the Republicans will do it?

      Imagine if this whole Iraq debacle had taken place under Clinton, with the all the same deceit, severing of alliances, incompetence, twisted intelligence, etc.  And no WMD.  Can you imagine the fury with which Republicans would be attacking him?  Can you imagine the speed with which they would have called for impeachment proceedings?  How many congressional investigations would we have had?  How many of them would have called for the SecDef's head?  The onslaught would boggle the mind.  And it would be justified.   Instead, because we live in a virtual one-party state today, we have nothing in the way of congressional oversight of the Bush administration.  With a couple of notable exceptions, most Republicans refuse to utter a word of criticism of the Dear Leader, opting instead to maintain the party line no matter what.  They are doing a profound disservice to their nation.  How many of them care?

      Today&nbsp;we learned that Iran helped six of the 9/11 hijackers get safe passage into the United States.&nbsp; They've already been our sworn enemy since 1979 and have been playing a major role in the insurgency in Iraq.&nbsp; Their ties to the Shi'a elite in Saddam's old country are well established.&nbsp; And they are also very close to having nuclear weapons.&nbsp;   Of the three countries that constitute our Dear Leader's "Axis of Evil," North Korea was easily the most dangerous,&nbsp;with an unstable ruler and&nbsp;a cache of nuclear weapons.&nbsp; Iran was next,&nbsp;ruled by anti-American radical Muslims and close to developing nuclear&nbsp;arms (who knows what other WMD it possesses).&nbsp; And then there was poor, pitiful, isolated&nbsp;Iraq,&nbsp;with a weak army and infrastructure and no ties to al-Qaeda.&nbsp; Saddam could kill his countrymen at will, but he was no threat at all to the U.S.   So which one did we choose to attack?&nbsp; Iraq, of course.&nbsp; Wolfowitz, Cheney, and Bush's decision to divert our power from hunting down al-Qaeda&nbsp;coupled with their utter disinterest in dealing with the real dangers of the post-9/11 world (read: N. Korea and Iran, to start with) show that they do not have America's best interests at heart, to say the least.&nbsp; They were more interested in settling old scores and nailing a reliable source of oil in the Middle East than they were in actually doing something to "roll back" terrorism.&nbsp;   Here we are, folks.&nbsp; This is what Dubya hath wrought.&nbsp; And there's no end in sight.

      Extreme-right conservatives like Robert Novak (who, let us never forget, revealed the name of a covert CIA agent and endangered her life and the lives of her fellow intelligence agents to score points for a president he knew was lying) and Christopher "Margaret Thatcher was a Liberal" Hitchens have been crowing over the claims in the Senate Intelligence Committee report that Valerie Plame  did  recommend her husband, Joseph Wilson, on the now-famous mission to Niger.&nbsp; This, the insist, proves that Wilson really  was  recommended by his wife to go to Niger.  &nbsp;  See where I'm going?&nbsp; Who cares who recommended Wilson?&nbsp; That's never been the issue, and ideologues like Hitchens and Hannity know it.&nbsp; The point is that the Bush regime revealed confidential information to Novak, a reactionary hatchet man who obviously doesn't care about American agents, in order to destroy Plame's career and discourage Ambassador Wilson from revealing the truth about the administration's intelligence claims.&nbsp; This is the point and they know it.  &nbsp;  Is anything else needed to&nbsp;illuminate the utter lack of character or honesty that&nbsp;lies at the barren&nbsp;core of this band of scheming&nbsp;cowards?

      Christopher Hitchens and Andrew Sullivan are just two of many archconservative Republicans who have been up in arms over the "lies" that are supposedly strewn throughout Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11.&nbsp;  These paragons of integrity deplore what they claim are the&nbsp;distortions, half-truths, and innuendo upon which Moore builds his case.  &nbsp;  But where is their outrage over Republican lies?&nbsp; Moore's film has been out for weeks now and no one has yet&nbsp;credibly documented a single major lie in it.&nbsp; Hitchens and Sullivan, along with their ideological soulmates Hannity, Limbaugh, O'Reilly, North, Coulter,&nbsp;and Savage, have huffed and puffed, but failed to blow Moore's house down.&nbsp; The film stands up.  &nbsp;  The same cannot be said for the propaganda of the Right.&nbsp; Hannity, Limbaugh, et al., routinely make up statistics and slander Democrats in an attempt to cover the woeful inadequacies of their worldview.&nbsp; In Coulterworld, for instance, it's bad to question Bush's integrity on Iraq intelligence, but perfectly OK to claim that Clinton was a serial killer and a&nbsp;drug trafficker.&nbsp; In Hannityworld, it's traitorous to criticize our Dear Leader when our troops are busy being screwed by his administration's pathetic lack of preparation for the postwar situation, but a patriotic duty to claim that Clinton put our troops into battle to distract the nation's attention from the Lewinsky scandal.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I could literally spend all day here giving more examples of Republican hypocrisy and double standards.&nbsp; But nothing I could say would ever make Hitchens or Sullivan require the same veracity from public figures of their own ideological persuasion that they demand from liberals.&nbsp;

      Michael Dukakis was a reasonably lousy candidate as the nominee of the Democratic Party in 1988.  He is most notorious for blowing a 17-point lead over Bush the First after that year's Democratic convention in August.  He gave a weird answer to a loaded question about the death penalty during  a debate.  And then there was that whole Willie Horton thing.  Now his name has come up again after all these years, this time in connection with the upcoming Democratic convention in Boston.  Some want him to appear; others don't.  Republicans were so effective at personally attacking Dukakis in '88 that he is, to this day, a virtual nonperson within the Democratic party.  In fact, his name is even more the kiss of death than McGovern's (another fine Democrat and public servant, not to mention a deeply honorable man).    This small tempest in a teapot strikes me as a sad commentary on the power of the Right in America.  Dukakis was a deficit hawk as a governor; he had Massachusetts' economy running so brilliantly that it was known as the "Massachusetts Miracle" in the eighties; he was an Army veteran (how many Republicans can say that?); he fought against the deeply pessimistic and hostile GOP at a time when many were cowering like sheep (hello, Dick Gephardt).  The fact that he wasn't very effective as a fighter must be acknowledged, but at least he tried.  Dukakis served as governor from 1975-1979 and 1983-1991.  He was above average throughout those 12 years.  Two things stand out for me from the '88 campaign, which took place when I was 11.  First, the whole Willie Horton affair, which still serves today to tell us all about what lies at the heart of the Republican Party.  Horton's crimes were used by the GOP to exploit hostility and stereotypes about blacks to score political points.  And, more notably, the weekend furlough program that allowed Horton to go free had been implemented not by Michael Dukakis, but by his Republican predecessor, Francis Sargent.  Poppy Bush and Lee Atwater never mentioned that, did they?  I also remember a comment our illustrious Gipper made about Michael and Kitty Dukakis' admission that they had sought counselling to deal with the latter's addictions.  Reagan, with a twinkle in his eye and his deep inner hostility on display as he rarely allowed it to be, said "I don't make fun of invalids" when a reporter asked him to comment.  I wonder if his family would have found sarcastic comments like that funny during the 10 years Ronnie spent as a vegetable.  I think not.

      Rush Limbaugh has now taken to calling John Edwards "The Breck Girl."  Shrub, who was only in his fourth year of "governing" Texas when he started to run for president, has said that the difference between Cheney and Edwards is that "Dick Cheney can be president."  Republicans everywhere are up in arms over Edwards' supposed lack of experience.  I would call these people hypocrites, but that would demean the word "hypocrite."  Edwards has nearly six years of service in the Senate under his belt, including several years on the Senate Intelligence Committee.  He has more foreign policy experience right now than Reagan and Dubya combined had when they were inaugurated.    What a pathetic, disgusting group of lying cowards the GOP has become.  Where's Ev Dirksen when you need him?

      Well, my flirtation with Prince Albert was most brief.  My first smoke of it, in my trademark Missouri Meerschaum Great Dane corncob pipe, was satisfying, but every subsequent smoke after that confirmed my initial worry: PA is little more that high quality cigarette tobacco.  Indeed, many roll it in cigarettes; this should have been a tipoff to me that it wouldn't be my cup of tea.    Now I'm going through an average of two bowls of Rumcake a day.  It's got a nice cut, it packs well, it burns wonderfully for a Cavendish, it doesn't bite my tongue at all, and it smells sweet and rummy without being cloying.  As its name suggests, it smells like something someone might bake for Xmas.    Daddy like.

      Smoking is so utterly looked down upon in our modern society that no politician could have a four-pack-a-day habit like Eisenhower or a three-pack-a-day habit like LBJ without it adversely affecting his public image.  Cigars, it seems, are acceptable, but what about pipes?  We pipe smokers are the quiet minority among the smoking population, but some pols have skillfully exploited the "pipe mystique" to their advantage.  In England, the late Sir Harold Wilson (1916-1995), who served as Prime Minister from 1964-1970 and 1974-1976, was as synonymous in his time for his ever-present pipe as Churchill had been for his cigars.  Harold Macmillan, who was PM from 1957 until 1963, was also a man of the pipe, but it wasn't as central to his image as it was to Wilson's.  Interestingly enough, Macmillan lived to be 92.  Among American presidents, Herbert Hoover was a notable pipe man.  He started out as an inveterate cigar smoker who indulged occasionally in the pipe, but, beginning in his early 60s, Hoover traded preferences, opting more and more for pipes.  He lived to be 90.    Gerald Ford, the last of the moderate Republicans, was a very heavy pipe smoker, consuming an average of eight bowls of tobacco a day; unfortunately, it didn't make the American public think of him as an intellectual.  Ford is now 91 and counting.  What's the pattern behind longevity and pipe smoking?  Bertrand Russell, who had a pipe burning whenever he wasn't eating or sleeping, lived to 98.  J.B. Priestley, a pipe man if there ever was one, lived to be 90.  At least two Surgeon General's reports have found pipe smokers who don't inhale (which means most of us) live 4-6 years longer than people who don't smoke at all.    I had a point here somewhere.  Anyway, this stuff interests me, and perhaps it will interest the minute few who read this blog.

      No, this isn't Rush Limbaugh taking responsibility for his hypocritical drug abuse.  Or Bush acknowledging errors about Iraq.  Or Cheney being contrite for his extraordinary outburst on the Senate floor.  It's me about Kerry's VP pick.  I was wrong.  He chose Edwards, and this is the strongest Democratic ticket in years.  President Kerry and Vice President Edwards.  Nice ring, no?

      There is a lot buzz in the media about Kerry's announcement that he will reveal his choice for VP on his website in the near future.  Some are betting on Edwards, some on Gephardt.  If I had to choose between the two, I'd choose the former.  In fact, I'd support Thomas Eagleton for the VP slot over Gephardt.  There's something about Dick Gephardt that rubs me the wrong way.  He comes across as a wimp, a guy with no convictions.  He was a disastrous Democratic leader in the House.  He has zero charisma.  And he such a well-known commodity that his addition would do virtually nothing for Kerry, except maybe help secure Missouri (though this is up for debate).    Edwards, on the other hand, possesses many virtues.  He is young, vigorous, charming, silver-tongued, and extremely likeable.  He oozes charisma and has been described by numerous reporters as the best stump speaker they've ever seen.  He connects with people, he's a self-made man, and he lost a son to a drunk driver (this makes me feel a bond with him, since a drunk driver paralyzed my wife).  He has empathy for lower- and middle-class Americans and is utterly without artifice.  In a debate with Dick "Go Fuck Yourself" Cheney, I think Edwards would come out on top, with ease.    Being from the South doesn't hurt Edwards either, though I don't think that would help turn the election for Kerry.  But Edwards has so many positive attributes that he almost sells himself.  Kerry could do a lot worse.  But will he choose him?  Something tells me no.

      Bought a 1.5 oz. pouch of original Prince Albert pipe tobacco yesterday.  A pipe man can't go through life without at least sampling the Prince.  It was surprisingly pleasant and mild, with a soft, nutty flavor that wasn't bad at all, despite its almost total lack of sweetness.  I might make it a regular part of my tobacco rotation.

      I bit the bullet last night and ordered a 14 oz. tin of the famous Mixture No. 79 pipe tobacco.  It was only $17.99 (not the cheapest you can find, but pretty damn cheap) and has been around since 1849.  Hugh Hefner smoked it from 1959 until 1985, when he had a stroke and swore off the pleasures of the briar forever.  From what I can tell from the various reviews, it tastes like a mixture of root beer, talcum powder, anise, licorice, deodorant, soap, flowers, and perfume.  With, er, a hint of vanilla.  Some hate it, some love it, but no two people describe it the same way.  Should be interesting.

      We all know that George H. W. Bush pulled strings to have his lazy, unaccomplished, sorry-ass, waste-of-space son Dubya placed in the Texas Air National Guard.  No one seems to question the reasoning behind this decision.  Why should we expect Poppy Bush to send his own son to serve in the war that they both so ardently supported?  Perish the ignoble thought!  But one can't help but wonder who got sent in his place.  Was it a poor kid?  One whose parents were not descended from New England old money?  One whose grandpa was not a millionaire senator from Connecticut named Prescott?  One who never got the chance to go to college, let alone carry out such important work as ordering kegs for frat parties?  Did he die in Dubya's place?  Did he expire in despair, grievously wounded, his body shattered, on a steamy trail in the jungles of Vietnam?  Did he just get maimed?  Did he come home and get spit on by anti-war protesters?  Has he been screwed, like so many others, by Bush's assault on the VA?  Hmmm.  I wonder.

      If there is anything our Dear Leader hates, it's veterans.  When he's not busy slashing the VA's budget (leaving my neighbor, an 81-year-old Army veteran who served from 1942 to 1973, pretty much fucked), he's hiring radical conservative groups to attack Vietnam veterans for him.   In the 2000 South Carolina primary, he had some vets attack John McCain's Vietnam service.  They even called him "Hanoi John."  (Would that make Dubya "Houston George"?)  Now we have another sample of his pathological hatred for those who went to Vietnam in his place.  A group of partisan extremists who style themselves the "Swift Boat Vets" are out attacking John Kerry's extraordinary military service, claiming that he was not the war hero his boatmates would have us all believe.  Of course, none of the Swift Boat Vets ever served with Kerry.  But, hey, they're Republicans, so we should take their word for it, right?  John McCain, who sometimes makes himself useful by pointing out the craven hypocrisy and cowardice of his fellow Republicans, immediately attacked the ad as "dishonest and dishonorable."  He added that he couldn't believe that President Bush could be behind it.  Now we all now that McCain hates Bush almost as much as Bush hates veterans, so I chose to take his last comment as a devilishly playful exercise in irony.  In the three months that remain between now and election day, expect many more attacks on veterans from our "Commander-in-Chief" and his puppet masters, Dick and Karl.

      I've heard a lot of Republicans lamely claiming that Osama is desperate to help John Kerry become our next president.  In other words, a vote against Bush is a vote for Osama.  But common sense suggests otherwise.  George W. Bush is the best thing that ever happened to Osama bin Laden.  First, Bush did absolutely nothing to protect America during the first eight months of his presidency, even ignoring urgent briefings on the threat Osama posed to America, and allowed 9/11 to be carried out without a hitch.  (No, I'm not saying Dubya knew it was coming, but he certainly did nothing to prevent it from happening.)  Second, Bush has been an absolute godsend for al-Qaeda by invading both Afghanistan and Iraq--and screwing both invasions up royally.  Afghanistan is now basically in chaos, with Americans maintaining order only in the area around Kabul, leaving the rest of the country to the warlords.  Iraq was a disaster from the beginning, and the weak puppet government there is despised by the people almost as much as America itself now is.  Bush is al-Qaeda's greatest recruiter.  Third, Bush's conduct in the war on terrorism has alienated most of the non-Muslim world as well.  Only a person as supremely incompetent and proudly stupid as our Dear Leader could have managed this.  This may be his greatest accomplishment.   Finally, Dubya still has not caught Osama.  The leader of al-Qaeda remains at large, planning and plotting, nearly three years after 9/11.   Why on earth would bin Laden want Kerry elected?  Bush remains integral to Osama's success.

      One of the most remarkable moments of the convention for me was when all the military brass, including Adm. William Crowe (who, incidentally, holds a Ph.D. in political science from Princeton), Gen. John Shalikashvili, and other less-known but equally imposing flag officers, came forward to throw their support behind Kerry.  If Gen. Wesley Clark's campaign marked a turning point, then the combined appearance of these generals and admirals definitely shows that the tide has turned as far as how the military itself views Republican support for our troops.   People like Paul Wolfowitz, who hasn't spent nearly as much time pondering the fate of our soldiers as he's spent grooming himself for TV interviews, don't care about whether our troops pay the price for the bureaucrats' incompetence.  Wolfie's deeply humiliating tongue-lashing at the hands of Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) at a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting demonstrated that his command of the facts and his ability to muster a coherent rationale for our invasion of Iraq utterly crumble once a few people start to, oh, you know,  question  him.   There can be no honest defense for dumping our resources on Saddam while Iran and North Korea go unchecked.  They remain today what they were in March of 2003: much more of a threat to America than Iraq ever was.  The admirals and generals know it, and that's why they want a president who takes the use of military force seriously and who would be interested in choosing a worthy and necessary target if our national security were at stake.

      Could this have gone better?  Terry McAuliffe should be both congratulated and thanked for setting up such a superb convention for the Democrats.  A masterful performance all around.  Clinton, Obama, Clark, Biden, Edwards, and Kerry--all delivered speeches that ranged from good to outstanding.  Kerry, though, surprised everyone with his speech, which combined hawkish and tough talk on terrorism with reasoned rhetoric on foreign policy in general.  The set-up from Max Cleland was perfect, and Kerry basically signalled that the time for Democrats to shy away from taking the initiative on national security is passed.  Yes, I know--the myth that Democrats are pussies on military and defense issues is just that: a myth.  Look at the careers of Scoop Jackson, Zbigniew Brzezinski, or Charles S. Robb (among many others) if you doubt it.  But what Kerry did was to announce that Democrats are now liberals at home but hawks on terrorism.   Why is this so important?  Because someone has needed to articulate this for years.  We  can  support gay marriage and universal health care and still devote our energy to crushing al-Qaeda and defending the homeland.  These are not opposing or mutually exclusive impulses.  If the Democrats want to continue to build upon the positive transformations initiated by Clinton, then we have to make our views on security clear and unambiguous.  I'm glad it was Kerry, the new leader of the party, who decided to do it.
