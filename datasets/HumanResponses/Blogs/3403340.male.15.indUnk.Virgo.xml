      i've got a lot to do this end of the year, and its not all that fun.  looking forward to having time to play the guitar a lot.  Fix up my blues, get the band working like the complex machine we should be.  I hope we can end up playing the quest.  i am listening to muddy waters.  What a guy.  If being sad is that soulful, i think i'll give it a shot.  This is strange, i feel like the closer i get to summer a certain feeling of nostalgia for the future occurs, even though it hasnt happened yet. sorry if that didnt make sense.      and his count of magical items had diminished by one...

      Who else loves the rain?, i know I do. And today it rained all day.  I got a chance to walk around barefoot in the woods in the rain.  I am at peace... However, tomorrow I have to get a brain scan... That ought to be a blast! nnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooootttttttttttttt. Last time I did that they made me hold my breath whenever the scanner went over me.  And the tube was really cold, yecch.  I hope all goes well, I really would rather not hear that I need some sort of surgery.  But if I do have surgery there is a pro, I get HOSPITAL SOCKS!!!!  Those are so nice, they have the little sticky pads on the bottom, and they are ever so warm.  The con of the situation is having to wear a gown.  I always imagined having to wear one, and waking up after anesthesia with a face drawn on my butt secretly, damn doctors..... I'm off te finish me book. g'night

      O.K.  It looks as though i have a blog.  WHat i mean to say is... this is my blog, or the blog that is this, belongs to me.  After an excrutiating million trillion billion hours of trying to find an adress that wasnt taken, i got one. It's something like: arg stop being unavailable, and, LO AND BEHOLD.... (success).  THus begins my journey into blogging and being blogged in return... I wonder if when you say "blogging" it has the double consanant, or if it just holds its own against the common rules of the english language and presents itself as a non-double consanant word.  Whew... I'm spent, time to get off to my REAL friends, Zola on aol... shes a blast. She calls me jesus or satan or even calafornia (that is if i wanted her to.)  I;m refering to a computer as if it were a person. Now i really need to go.
