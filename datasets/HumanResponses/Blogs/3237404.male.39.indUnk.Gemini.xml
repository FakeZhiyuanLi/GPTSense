      *Also posted on my other site, Gimped Redneck*  I've been thinking much about people lately and their presuppositions of their place in the world.  In reading the local small-town newspaper, I find about relatives visiting various townfolk, local politicians and their look of position, tragedies found, and obituaries of people who might have never before been found worthy of print.  I move on to the larger newspaper of nearby college/industrial towns, and find happenings of cultural value and people related to it.  I also find about new businesses openings accompanied by hopeful smiles as would normally be found on the face of a new papa.  I see commentaries on subjects of no real value to human life than the reason to rant, and I see tribute to the lives of the departed fortunate alongside the misfortunes of the less regarded.  Everywhere I find someone has the ultimate way for me to save money by shopping at their establishment, or values on new cars I can only dream about.  On up to a paper/magazine of national or international scale, I find people mentioned for noble birth and caste, riots and the incivility of the human race, agenda's, and other notable mentions.  In all this, I am given a view of humanity as a whole.  Here I sit in my little bedroom while my four kids play on the bed, I am privy to the lives, hopes, and tragedies of the world...Both my local and global neighbors are here.  I wonder who has the answer to life and can offer a true definition of success.    "Grandma Jones was at her proudest moment when she was presented a great grandchild in her living room," while a thousand miles away, "Jack Doe is being toasted for winning a Pulitzer."  I see a picture of old Walter Thompson being helped from a pickup truck after returning home from the funeral of his wife of 47 years.  The text quotes some of the talk inside his little house as they remember funny and memorable milestones in the life of his wife.Across a Continent I see Limousines with family members and associates being escorted to the graveside of their recently departed...owner of a Fortune 500 company.The text gives a breakdown of his success in business, then goes on to discuss how his empire will be divided.    At the funeral of Walters wife, I am told that he just stood with his grown children with a look of loss, as he wrenched at the brim of his hat, the photo's of the mogul's funeral shows the ladies in vale and men with starched faces.  In the end...Who will be the more sorely missed?  Maybe I should not read the papers for awhile...

      Pondering the pursuit of wealth and where will it lead...Retirement center/quality of life?  Making an impact...  I have noticed lately that in many people (including me)life holds two components depending on where one is in life.  For people like me, struggling to make ends meet is a major factor in my life.  I have many responsibilities and most of them center around being able to afford provision for my family.  Most of my time is spent trying to make money, figuring out how to make more money, or how to spend it and who gets the biggest cut first.  Life is hard and it would seem that it is mostly due to this lack of finances.  I also have friends who are extremely well off, and much of their time is spent making money, figuring out the best way to make more, The wisest way to spend/invest their money, and protecting it.  One advantage they do have over me though is the freedom from having to worry about keeping the kids fed, or how to keep the lights on. Their cars don't break down and if something needs fixed, a repairman is just a phone call away.  But, they still have the stress of protecting and increasing it.  They go on vacations while I rent a movie for the family to watch.  I have also noticed that in charity, most of the time, my $100 bill is matched by theirs.  Not all that much of a difference in giving.  I find this strange.  Am I more charitable, or is there simply a set standard to give?  While I do make a difference at times through my charity, they could really make an impact, but choose not to.  Where I offer a band-aid, they have the ability to totally heal the wound, but don't.  My giving always costs me much and my family always feels the impact of it.  I wonder how much their giving really costs them?  Do they have to maybe eat a little cheaper?  Put off buying clothes the children desperately need?  Maybe shuffle around their bill paying schedule...I don't know because I am not there.  Another thing I have noticed is that regardless of financial status, we all die the same.  Some may get a nicer box to be buried in and more pomp and circumstance, but none-the-less, both end up in the same dirt.    I believe it would be wise if people could realize it is not the amount you give that makes the difference, but rather the price you pay, to make that difference.  If some work of charity is to be of any real impact, it will always come at a high cost to the giver, and if not, then the work is all in the name of vanity.  We can either pay up front, or in the end, but we all will pay!  Only we can decide how we want to be remembered...I prefer not to be happily forgotten as a vain person, but fondly remembered as a person of impact!

      Why are our soldiers fighting?  Do they belong in Iraq?   I am currently a nontraditional college student (geezer going to school) and am constantly exposed to the liberal thought which says that the U.S. has no business in Iraq.  I also happen to live deep in the country where most everyone is a gun toting conservative, and everyone believes we were right in our invasion of Iraq.    To complicate this a little bit more, my wife's baby brother is now in Iraq serving as a medic.  Do we want him there?  No!  Should he be there?  Yes!  He is helping many people, both Iraqi and U.S. to hold onto life until they can get to a hospital, so his work is good and he is making a difference in the world.  He doesn't want to be there, but feels as long as he can help save someone's life, then he does belong there.  He has gone so far as learn some Iraqi on his own time in order to ask medical questions and offer comfort to the Iraqis.  He just sees people.  In this, we, as he, feel like he does belong there.    Another thing is the fact that he "chose" to join the military, and has an obligation to fulfill his contract.  He knew the potential was there for military action.  He was taught how to kill and how to survive. In this, he is mandated by honor to do the service he has agreed to.  With that said, I will admit to being a liberal conservative.  I believe that we should mind our own business, but step up and fight when the cause is right.  Do I believe the U.S. should have invaded?  Yes, but not for the reasons given.  This whole Weapon's of Mass Destruction has proven to have not panned out, and I honestly would not be surprised to find that Iraq had them.  But, I feel that this reason of suspicion was not strong enough to invade.  My reason for supporting the invasion is as follows.    First, if you go to the U.S. State department and do a search on Iraq, you will literally find hundreds of documents with Saddam and his two sons as the topic of point.  The issue is one of inhumane and cruel treatment of the Iraqi people.  You can also go to Amnesty International or any other of a number of human rights groups and read just how evil this monster and offspring were.  They were sadistic, psychotic, and maniacal in their actions.  Think someone "might" look at you wrong...Throw them into an industrial shredder live.  Torture for fear and fun seemed to be their hobby.  This is my reason, and was so excited with this family being either killed or caught, as was the case with Saddam.  The world will be so much better without those monsters.  Second, the U.N. (go to their website) had listed many reasons for supporting an attack on Iraq.  Just read through the last few years, and you will find it.  Do I believe Iraq will become a peaceful and democratic nation?  No.  The world of the middle east is not one of a democratic culture.  They have warlords and tyrants just waiting in the wings.  While I believe there are some Iraqis who will try to make the plan work, they will most likely be overrun in the end.  With all the oil at stake, some nation will corrupt and profit from it.  Just ask yourself how Saddam, Yassir, and Osama got their strength in the first place.  The only way I see of  changing this culture would be to imprison the culture for life, while taking the very young and raising them as "we" would want them to be...Democratic pawns.

      Going to school in the seventies I was told that I needed to be part of the physically and that if I really tried, I could be anything I wanted to be.  By the time I grew up there would be a woman for president and if I wanted, I could walk on the moon.  With this in mind, I decided that indeed I wanted to be an astronaut, or at the least an air force pilot.  The educators kept telling us this through their curriculum and I continued to believe it.  What they did not tell me was how I needed to go about becoming what they had fostered.    While it is true there was a counselor to advise us, the closer I got to graduation, the faster I realized I had no direction.  I would ask about pursuing my goals, and they would say study hard.  Upon graduation in the early eighties, with diploma in hand, I promptly became a chicken de-beaker for one of the local poultry contractors.       In our little “working-class” town, I was somewhat successful as I was known to be a hard worker, industrious, and someone who earned their way.  Of my graduating class, I can only remember maybe 4 of my peers who went to college, which was mostly because their parents insisted upon it; two of them graduated.  This was not an idea I found pushed in the school system, unless the student had an outlined plan for their future.  For the rest of us, we were told to work hard…make something of ourselves.    In seeing that my jobs were getting me nowhere, I decided to go to a local vo-tech where it was decided that I should be a diesel mechanic.  I loved the theory part of  class, and even the lab, but quickly realized I did not want to be a diesel mechanic, so I quit.  After a few more years of work, I found myself leaning back on the same conclusion of needing an education, which ended up sending me on to a technical school to become a “HVAC” engineer (heat and air serviceman), thanks to a wonderfully crafted Television commercial.  Once again, I loved the theory and lab, but hated the practical part of what the outcome would be.  I had no desire to fix someone’s air conditioner!   After graduation I became a hard worker again.  I wound up working in a specialized human service industry where I worked hard and made my way up from the lowest level, to the position of second in command alongside another hard worker.  I had finally realized some amount of success and was told that upon the retirement of my superior, I would be the best qualified for the position.  Things were good, and the time of his retirement came as I had been grooming myself for the step up.  Was I ever ready!    The outcome was a little different than I had expected.  It was decided that a college intern that worked there would be the perfect fit for this position, so I settled in staying where I was, as I was told that I should feel honored to have the position I currently held, especailly in light of the fact that I had no college education.  A year later and the place of some twenty-five years shut its doors.  Now this couldn’t be due the lack of experience on the part of the educated director, but more along the lines of a poor economy, (not like the company hadn’t weathered hard times before).  While in an admittable amount of disbelief and shock, I still held a certain degree of hope for the future.  In my former position, I had worked alongside engineers, HR directors, and plant managers of many national and international businesses.  I was in the know, had the contacts, and a list of great references that would open any door.  Another thing, which boosted my confidence, was the fact that many of the corporate people I worked with, made less money than me, and surely I could walk into their world with little problem…my hard work and good attitude would carry me through. In fact, many of the lower level line workers were college graduates and this served as a boost to me in the thought that it was the person and not the pedigree that insured success.  The reception I found was a little different than I expected though.  While I was experienced, the “good” jobs were reserved for those with college degrees.  All my “hard work” just wasn’t enough.  Back in 1983 with dream in hand, I had not the faintest idea of the course life would take.  Some twenty years later I find myself going to college, which is what I would have done in the first place had someone told me the truth.  I now have professors younger than me who are trained in areas of scholarship, yet have no practical experiences in the field.  I sit and listen to them teach what I have experienced, and know their recipe will not always work.  I have to take classes of no interest but high expense in order to attain a degree that will allow me to “work hard.”  I am guaranteed no success, but rather, am being enlightened.  I have found that I need to be tolerant of everything…don’t weigh the intent or outcome, just tolerate.  I am disciplined to concentrate on the mechanics more than the idea, and that conservative republicans are evil, but there is no God.  I am learning to embrace all religions of the world and to shun Christianity.  The most important thing I am finding is that in the United States of America, a country with English as it’s national language, I will not be allowed to gain my college diploma without learning the Spanish language.  I am definitely getting an education.  In all fairness though, there are a few exceptions I have found, and they are truly professors of scholarship and have my respect.  As I sit in class with student’s young enough to be my children, I wonder what they have been taught.  They have shared much knowledge in how we shouldn’t harvest trees; some have learned it is wrong to eat meat, and that they are ahead of the game due to their lack of judgment against their (his or her) fellow citizens of the world.  I have also found them for the most part, are not educated in any of the hard sciences, and many can only spell their own name with any degree of confidence.  Good portions of them are from split, mixed, or single parent families, and I can safely say some have even functioned as the head of their family.  This bothers me much.  In wondering what went wrong for these students, and how they got where they are I have realized that it is my generation that was at the helm.  The ones who were pushed to dream and be whatever they wanted to be.  The girl sitting by me in class just might be the daughter of "Madame President."  Yes, it was my generation who went from dreams to despair and in such, has birthed a generation of disregard and submission through the guise of tolerance.    It would seem that I was the product of an open ended agenda.  My childhood education was little more than me being a product of manufacture for one of the strongest businesses in the country; the public school system.  Their intent was not for my best interest, but to produce another cog for the machine, which is now wearing out.  Tell me what I want to hear and I just might follow you all the way to hell.  Oh, "Hell" doesn't exist...nevermind.  There is so much more I would like to say on this subject, but I must wrap it up, as I am expecting a call from N.A.S.A!

       A little background.  My young brother-in-law, is from Wisconsin and is a member of the National Guard (correct me if I am wrong) there.  I believe it was about six month's back that his unit was activated and away they went as a medical team to Iraq.  Shortly after his arrival, their Father died and he was back on leave for the funeral and family management.  His twin brother and older sister were waiting for him, and we received a call informing us of "father's" death, (my wife was adopted out before her parents married and had the three younger siblings afterward, and had only met her siblings, a younger sister [the eldest], and two twin brothers) and was asked to come to the funeral and really felt her siblings needed the support.  So off we went.  At the funeral, both brothers were attired in their military dress (both are in the military, only one activated), and following the funeral all met at a local restaurant to eat, talk, and let things sink in some.  While walking across the parking lot, many people honked their horns, waved, gave the thumbs up, and showed approval of them in a moving way.  It was very nice.  After we returned home (800 miles away), the brother from Iraq requested and received an extension to help settle estate and family, which was good.  As time moved toward his scheduled departure for Iraq, his family  really didn't want him to leave, especially with the recent loss of "father," which is understandable.  The twin brothers, when together, operate as two parts of one...Almost like all that they do is choreographed for perfect synchronization, and when apart, they have to feel somewhat displaced.    The family and friends in the mean time started petitioning his commander, as well as many governmental representatives and officials, for his release from active duty.  They truly were terrified that he would not return, and with  all of them being in their early twenties, I can understand their feeling such.  What was odd was the fact that the brother being fought over was very quiet.  No word from him at all.  In the end the request was denied and he went back to Iraq, while the family persisted from state-side in his behalf.  Still Younger brother remained silent.  We also remained silent.  The family petitioned us to join in the battle and for all they knew, we had.  The truth was that we could not join in as we felt that this young man's integrity and honor would be damaged if he did get the easy way out.  So....We chose to do as he had, and just sat back and watched how things would play out.  It was his test and trial, and as hard as it was, it was a fight that only he could take up.  We continued to receive emails from him from time to time, but they had now become rather dry and to the point.  Then finally (I believe a month or so later)we received an email (addressed to all his loved ones) that had a scary intro, but led into triumph for him.  He shared how miserable and depressed he was.  That the stress was making him physically sick, to which we were very concerned.  He then goes on to tell how he went to his company commander that morning and informed him the he had no intention of leaving his unit or going home before any of them.    This act took much courage on his part  both to tell his family no, and in light of the fact that they are attacked daily with rpg's and such, and still choose to stay.  A very proud day for this family indeed...Little Brother is a patriot bound by honor and duty!  I now address him directly for the whole world to know what we think of him.   Bart, hear me!  I cannot tell you how proud and honored I am to have you as my brother-in-law!  I know how tough your decision was to make and in this, I know you have elevated yourself to a higher level of being.  Your task and role in Iraq is noble and you will never be questioned about your decision by any of your hillbilly relates.    I have faced death many times and still cannot conceive how it must be to live with it's potential on a daily basis, but I do know that every day you are there, your wisdom and integrity grows.  You are seeing how precious life is, and I honor you in your work of preserving it for so many wounded people in this tragic conflict.  Your work sees no color, recognizes no language, and honors no flag.  The work of saving lives requires one to give their life...To each and every person they help.  I know who you are, and also know that those you help, know you as well.  Your only mission is revealed in your eyes and manner.  This cannot be taken, but only given, and I must thank you for giving so freely.  My only words of advice to you little brother Bart is, to stay the course, increase your knowledge, grow your faith in God, and continue to be right.  Apart from this, there is little else of significance to offer you.    To the rest of the family, I implore you to rally around him in support and declaration.  Offer only that which will help him in his quest, while allowing love and respect to tide you over until he returns home.    If you ever need anything over there, don't hesitate to call upon a family that loves and supports you in your journey and decision!  We salute you and those working alongside you in your efforts to save the lives of any who might need your help.  Indeed, we are PROUD!  You do well little brother!  We love you!

      You know,   I am an American and I do believe in paying my taxes! I  do not  cheat on my returns and go strictly  by the books  because I do believe that as an American, I am  obligated  to do so in order to keep my freedom. It is nothing less than my part.    The part of other's it would seem would be that they are somehow deserving freedom and deem it ok to find every shortcut and "white" cheat possible to get out of paying their "fair" share. Not only do they  not  feel bad about it, but to the contrary, they  boast  of their prowess as if they are a jump ahead of it all. Most of these "associates" of mine are self proclaimed liberal democrats, to which I clam to belong to neither camp and vote purely based on the person and their credibility....Nothing more or less. These same people can do nothing but criticize the people holding office if they might be republican and rant about how the current administration is ruining the whole system. When President Bush announced that people would be getting an extra return, all these people raised the dust and proclaimed he would sink the nation, but when the checks showed up, they were in line with me at Wal-Mart spending the money with a smile. Either you are for, or you are against. I personally believe if these shining democrat citizens would quite cheating their beloved nation out of taxes, the issues of an "extra" return would not have been a need.  These liberals mostly without knowing, support art endowments (whatever happened to starving artist.....There's plenty of starving carpenters, taxi-cab drivers and factory workers out there...How about that starving office worker or wait person?). They support Planned parenthood and abortion (which I don't believe in because it is my right....And no, I do not shoot doctor's and yell at pregnant teenagers as I do respect their liberty as an individual and if my belief system is right, God will deal with them....I don't have to). They support the homosexual agenda in the one's sexuality should determine one's status and rights. All the while they are supporting this notion through their choice of politics and cheating the system, they are leaving me and others like me, to pay up. They will talk about, harass and heckle the "weird" artist, "promiscuous" teen or homosexual, and Heaven help you if you need any sort of assistance from the welfare system (they are referred to as leeches), yet, the politics they are proclaiming pushes forward that, which as it would appear, supports exactly what they hate.  On the other hand, my taxes go to support public schools which are failing miserably so we homeschool. That's right! We homeschool and still pay taxes in for the public school....Do we receive any tax credit for not adding to the tax system's list of beneficiaries? No....We are Americans and pay our share. While discussing the public school system, it is important to know that anyone who utilizes them, is basically on Welfare! The public school child is being given an education by the taxes collected from the citizens, you and me. I also am paying an "artist" to mold manure or pose nude for all the world to see...Did we ask to see this....No, but we did pay for it! Was there a national campaign conducted among the "tax-payers", not "tax-cheaters", which would allow us to choose our selection of the artist that should be funded? That's ok though, it is all part of me being a citizen in good standing. What about that pregnant teen/unwed mother? Did I get them pregnant? Don't think so....Do I believe the teen should be taken up by planned parenthood so they can get an abortion? No I don't. How about the homosexual, should they be afforded the honor of being married? No, marriage is for a man and women, and they should come up with their own institution....It's all a matter of definition. As far as rights that would shadow marriage, I say go ahead....That way we can all be unfairly taxed if we are married or committed to a partner. I would think they would be better of financially if they left things alone. If they are worried about who has control of the others possessions if one should die, then make out a will....Simple enough.  By now, one would probably think I really hold a fair amount of contention for the pregnant teen/unwed mother, artist that receives endowments, or homosexual, (I probably would from what I have written so far). The truth is that while I do not support any of these individuals and their cost to me financially through taxes, I do have compassion for them. The are just like me, flesh and blood, have the same needs for survival, and are a part of the human race. I have fed and financed at various times (when able) these very people. It is my right  not  to have to support them through my taxes, and even let them know how I feel, just as they have the same right to not accept my help (not happened yet), and not support my choices and style of life. It is   not   my right to not help them when their lives are in some sort of peril. As a part of a free society and the human race, one who follows the lead of Jesus Christ (who did he turn away in need), it is my duty, honor and obligation to help those who suffer. If I am to be able to love myself and family, then I must also love what we are, and thus have to love and care for society in general. Yes, I have worked with, cared for and helped those who would seem to be hated by the ones whose politics support them.  I personally believe that everything should be tolled. If I am to drive on a certain hiway, then I should pay for it as I use it. Give me an itemized list of everything our taxes go for and let me pay for that which I know I will use. Give me an automatic tag which would keep a record of services I had utilized (the technology is there) and figure my taxes from there on in. If it ends up that I have utilized planned parenthood, then I pay, if not, then no pay.  This whole issue has come down to a point that charity leaves a bruise (scarlet letter) on those who need it. It also has taken charity from what it once was, people caring for people, and turned it into a governmental department and tax write-off.  I would think that a better system would be one that left charity to society and allowed participants to receive and give as able. There is nothing wrong with charity, but people should be the core of it. If you need my help....Just ask, but never take it by force as the government is now doing. I will give you so much more if you simply ask than if you demand.  My own convictions would have to state that I am an American citizen and I support legitimate taxation. I do not support hypocrisy on the part of the cheaters though. Make them pay so I can pay less. I also believe that if our culture is allowed release from illegitimate taxation, we will require less from our government in support; might just turn out that we can actually take care of ourselves. I believe that the individual must stand somewhat accountable for their actions. We all mess up from time to time, but why is it that my mistakes are never ones that allow me to collect money from the rest of society?  I proclaim to be neither Republican or Democrat as I do not believe either has an adequate answer to the questions of our culture. I believe Presidents are Puppet's and their corporate puppetmaster's are in control of their "big" moves. Congress is a society within itself where the participants are trying to shape a culture they are severely removed from. I see our society as one who is lazy and seeks every shortcut they can find, as they shirk personal responsibility. If our govenment is to be one that is ran for and by the people, then people need to speak up, show up, and stank up for their vision of America and how it should be. I also never vote a party ticket, but rather judge the candidates by their past record, past history, and future potential. Liar's and cheater's can be found out quite easily these days on the internet, but how many people actually know the full portrait of the person they are voting for? The media has their own agenda and should be disregarded for lack of credibility (go to the governmental sites and read up before you pick which horse to place "your" money on.  I know this letter sounds a bit tart, but, I am a little upset from hearing so much about politicians who have no struggles, yet are allowed to determine my fate and taxation. Like the crying Indian said (I can say that because I am Native American), "Don't tell me how to walk until you have walked a mile in my shoes....." I am quite comfortabe speaking boldly because I can back up my claims and observations.  I encourage all to become a part of the system rather than being subject to it.   Till next time....

      What is time? Time is something that seems to play the role of markers in ones life.        Pamela&nbsp;retired after 25 years with the company...   Johnny turned 16 and will be getting a car soon...   he was only 103 when he died...   I work 40 hrs. A week....   bake the cookies for 45 minutes...   finally some time for me...Just gonna do nothing...   It's about time for a break...   When one takes the time to actually look at how measured out our lives are, it can take one to deeper depths of understanding and realization.   I have lately been hearing the phrase, "I don't have time" which makes me stop and think...What do they mean they don't have time?&nbsp; We all have the same time.&nbsp; We need time to work, eat, sleep and&nbsp;be with our loved ones.&nbsp; I have found that these basic functions usually make time for themselves.&nbsp; I have also noticed that many people who do not&nbsp;have time, also have to play computer/PS2/X-box games, or watch some particular series on television (usually they&nbsp;have complete schedule for everynight of the week) or some activity just as important.&nbsp;  When such a pursuit as television or games enters ones life, they are limited on time as these activities do manage to steal much of our time from us.&nbsp; For them, there simply is not enough time...   Solution:   Spend your time more wisely!&nbsp; One must prioritize their time and activities to fit within the time given.&nbsp; Is your family important to you.&nbsp; Parents, children, siblings and friends are very important.&nbsp; Where are they on your timeline of importance?&nbsp; These pursuits of loved ones are the foundation of any culture and should be built strong, which&nbsp;does take time.&nbsp;   How about health?&nbsp; Are we spending the time it takes to maintain a physically strong body, which will lengthen and enrich one's life, as well as save money (easier than toiling for it)&nbsp;&nbsp; over the span of a lifetime.&nbsp;   Our minds, are we enriching them to their potential, or allowing them to operate at their bare minimum?&nbsp; Scientific studies have shown that a mind that is exercised daily is also one that stays healthy into old age.&nbsp; If one could spend just thirty minutes a day (usually the time equivalent to one sitcom or a few rounds of a game) they would invariably raise their position in life and society.&nbsp; Learn a new language, or enhance a skill in the arts.&nbsp; Study history in order to understand the future.&nbsp; Find a collectible you are interested in and research it!&nbsp; Who knows, it could just develop into a career of painting or owning your own specialty business.&nbsp;   There is plenty of time for us all, it is just that we all need to learn that it is metered out in increments and it is up to us to delegate how it is spent.&nbsp; Time&nbsp;will either&nbsp;be that which is taxing or enhancing.&nbsp; What will it be for you?     Benvolio       ...Do right...And you will&nbsp;Be right...

      Praise God!  Slept from 4:00 a.m. to 7:34 a.m.!  Three and a half hours of straight uninterrupted sleep!  I feel so awake!  It's been so long since I have had this kind of rest....  Well, the UPS shipment didn't arrive because UPS didn't have the stuff.  Instead it was shipped in FedEx...On a semi-truck.....Talk about heavy...Long evening and all that is left is the delivery.  I've been thinking much about people lately and their presuppositions of their place in the world.  In reading the local small-town newspaper, I find about relatives visiting various townfolk, local politicians and their look of position, tragedies found, and obituaries of people who might have never before been found worthy of print.  I move on to the larger newspaper of nearby college/industrial towns, and find happenings of cultural value and people related to it.  I also find about new businesses openings accompanied by hopeful smiles as would normally be found on the face of a new papa.  I see commentaries on subjects of no real value to human life than the reason to rant, and I see tribute to the lives of the departed fortunate alongside the misfortunes of the less regarded.  Everywhere I find someone has the ultimate way for me to save money by shopping at their establishment, or values on new cars I can only dream about.  On up to a paper/magazine of national or international scale, I find people mentioned for noble birth and caste, riots and the incivility of the human race, agenda's, and other notable mentions.  In all this, I am given a view humanity as a whole.  Here I sit in my little bedroom while my four kids play on the bed, I am privy to the lives, hopes, and tragedies of the world....Both my local and global neighbors are here.  I wonder who has the answer to life and can offer a true definition of success.    Grandma Jones was at her proudest moment when she was presented a great grandchild in her living room, while a thousand miles away, Jack Doe is being toasted for winning a Pulitzer.   I see a picture of old Walter Thompson being helped from a pickup truck after returning home from the funeral of his wife of 47 years.  The text quotes some of the talk inside his little house as they remember funny and memorable milestones in the life of his wife.  Across a Continent I see Limousines with family members and associates being escorted to the graveside of their recently departed...owner of a Fortune 500 company.  The text gives a breakdown of his success in business, then goes on to discuss how his empire will be divided.    At the funeral of Walters wife, I am told that he just stood with his grown children with a look of loss, as he wretched at the brim of his hat, the photo's of the mogul's funeral shows the ladies in vale and men with starched faces.  In the end...Who will be the more sorely missed?  Maybe I should not read the papers for awhile...

      It is 4:20 a.m. and am still waiting on sleep...  Have been doing some thinking about my situation.  Why does life have to be so preoccupied by the need for money?  I have absolutely the most wonderful wife and kids who all love each other.  I could not ask for more.  I am just put aside by the fact that I as a Father am not a good provider.  It seems that no matter what I try, or how hard I have tried, I have failed.  I am so tired of watching my children accepting less in a world of more.  While I don't believe they should always get what they want, they should be afforded some nice things.  Having much pain now and I think that compounded by our shakey standing right now is not helping at all.  I have to wonder if I did have the ability to provide a good life, would I still have a good family???  Later, it is time to lay down and watch the clock...

      Well, I just awoke and found I have added two more hours to my sleep card.  Much to do today.  Ups will be bringing some stuff that we will package into kits then send back out tomorrow.  Also getting the kids to do their chores has become a chore itself.    Much pain...Rain must be on the way!  More later  Had to come in and edit this post.  seems like medical condition is working against my writing skills as well.  I sometimes don't transcribe my thoughts correctly.  In this case, bring had to be changed to bringing.  Also a few cases of dyslexia poking up it's ugly head also.

      I still have had very little sleep, but things are getting odd. I have felt rested the last couple of days on a total of 3 hrs of sleep out of 48.  Pam took the dog to the vet to get stitches out, and picked up some pour-on flea/tick killer...Hopefully this will work as the poor dog has received little relief from the stuff sold in the stores.  We'll see.  I went along with Pam and the kids to her home office to pickup some material then on the my school.  It was good to see Susan, Mike, and the rest of the gang.  Christie has taken a new job at a bank and will be missed... It was nice to take the kids up because they always get all kinds of attention.  Today Mangela took the kids to the chum bucket and bought them some candy...They were so excited!  Susan and Mike also made a big fuss over them, which they totally loved.  On our way back from Bentonville, we dropped by the wholesale house to pick up some supplies for our flea market booths.  I wasn't totally happy with what they had, but it was still worth the trip.  Found some really cool giraffe's and a hippo figurine.    On the final leg home, a 19 mile strip of country without any stores or gas stations, I noticed the fuel gage was on "E".  That's what I hate about fibromyalgia; things that normally would be noticed, just slip by.  Anyway, we ended up having to detour to Westville for gas. I think we just prayed our way there, as It was so below the mark.  When we did get to a station, the tank kinda gasped when I took the cap off...literally running on fumes.  The depressing part was that it took $45 to fill the tank.  This $2 a gallon junk is getting so old.  One thing I forgot, at the wholesale house, I picked up two really awesome cast iron doves.  Very cool.  Hopefully we will have good sales this month...Money is so very tight, and it is very scary when investing what little you don't have, in order to not get by.  We are playing a frightening game...Praying we will be able to pays bills next month.  This stress is starting to get to all of us.    Pain level didn't get too bad until late this evening, then had to really hit the meds for some relief.  Storms must be on the way.

      Just found out that a very good friend I call Mama, just lost a grandaughter.  Tashi was just 16 years old.  Mama tried so hard with these children and it saddens me much at her loss.    All our prayers for Mama.

      I woke around 8:30 this morning, but it took me until 9:45 to be able to get out of bed.  Showered, Pam got the kids ready and we went to town.   Post office, attorney, bank, bank, Wal-mart Pharmacy.  At the attorney, I found out how I needed to dress and what I needed to bring.  Believe it or not, this is the first time I have met my attorney, but was impressed!   I've got to come up with past and present letters of Reference, so think that will be no big deal.  Also need academic transcript, pharmacy records, Letter of qualification from Arkansas Rehab Services, and anything else I might find pertinent.  Am having much trouble with short term memory and sleep.  Up all night due to pain, then fall asleep for an hour or so during prime family time.  This is really disrupting life..........  The pain was moderate today...Tolerable with meds, but no fun!  Our debt seems to be compounding daily and not sure how long we can hold on.  Really need disability to come through, but even with that, finances will be very tough.  We drove by a couple of houses that would be so perfect....Want to get one of them in particular, and would if not for the lack of resources. It had enough room for our family and even had a basement, which we really would like.  It is hard to cope with the realization of having what one desperately needs, is very much in view, and always just out of reach.    It is becoming very hard to keep Pam out of depression, and I wonder about myself much also.  I really don't know where I am standing mentally...Very tired.  I used to have so much hope, anticipation, and drive.  Now I have despair, depression, and confusion.  Fighting hard to regain hope... The hearing is set for June 10!  It seems like life started and ended before we really got into the game.  Am praying for a fair start again.    Lord deliver us!

      Today was ok.  Pam had to work, but was home early...Around 2.  The kids did pretty well with their new list of chores I created for them.    Pam was in a pretty good mood and we all became enthused as she brought in some heat and eat food: hot pretzels, pizza rolls, and sausage!    Had a moderate amount of pain so all in all was pretty good!  We also watched some pretty good DVD's!    It is now 4:22 a.m., and am still very much awake.  Tomorrow I go to the attorney to discuss my disability hearing.  I pray things work out, for if they don't, we are sunk!  One of our state legislators sent a pretty good letter to the powers that be, in support of a positive decision on the hearing.  I really hate fibromyalgia.

       Ok, it's been 15 days since the hearing and here's the low-down on what all has taken place.  A couple of days after the hearing things start to sink in somewhat.  Here's what will take happen concerning it.  In somewhere between now and a couple of month's, we will start receiving disability benefits, which will be so very appreciated!  We now have confidence that we will be able to repay debt incurred including the few select people who have helped us.  You have been a Godsend!  Thank you!  For the last couple of month's our dryer has been trying to die.  At first just the faint squeak here ant there, but as time moved on, it became more prevalent and finally on the day of the hearing, screeched a non-stop cry of death...No breaks or subsession..Constant, and so loud it would drive one crazy!  This dryer has been a very faithful servant and with a few repairs over the past eleven years has proven to be a good investment.  But now, it's time had come and with the assurance of income, it was time to replace this relic.   In comes the new player.  This fella is a MayTag IntelliDry.  A large capacity (which means all the clothes will be dry).  Beulah Gale and I are simple people and prefer to purchase simple tools.  She found and chose this dryer for the simple design and how it performed.  This beast has proven to be very effective in operation and I am sure will last as long as the last.     hint: if you are going to buy a washer or dryer, or any appliance, spend the few extra $$ and get one that is of some quality...It always pays off in the end through the length and quality of service it will give.    The whole family is so very happy with this unit and I personally am happy to see that all the kids from two to eleven years of age, were just as excited as we two adults.  Almost like Christmas day.    What I find so pleasing is the fact that the kids participate in all aspects of the family.  As my wife and I became stressed and depressed with scary situations, they followed suit (which I do not like), and when we are excited about something as boring as a dryer, they are right there with us also.  I have learned so much about family during this difficult period of time.  Through all the ups and downs they are there.  We are one unit; a family.  While this time has been very humbling to me, I cannot honestly say that I would change any of it as I have been shown so much.   I do love my family!

       I have finally gained the courage to post the letter I wrote on the day the hearing was held and decided upon.   6-10-2004  Well today turned out to be a very difficult and draining day.  Went to sleep around 5 a.m. and was back up at 7.  Trying to get ready for the hearing was no fun as I was very nervous.  Should Beulah Gale go with or stay at home?  Getting the kids ready for childcare (a very rare thing) and changing shirts a half dozen times.  The day I have been waiting for over a year had finally arrived, and I am so nervous I can't sit still.  It is a rainy and over cast day...Just like the day I was ran over...  Once the kids are deposited, it is just she and I, as we drive to the big town...Small talk and little tidbits of encouragement from her from time to time.  When we finally arrive and find a parking spot, she looks to me and asks, "what will we do if we do not win?"  I answer, "I don't know.....We will win..."    We finally make it to the third floor and find where we are to be, the security guard is most pleasant and appreciated for his attitude.  Beulah Gale offers more encouragement and I am probably just as nervous as any time one of our children were born (at home).  I try to pace, but forget that...The gimped are not very adept at pacing...So I hobble back and forth.  The attorney finally arrives and tries to prepare me and I assure him I am ready, while mentally I am just about to flip!  The rest of our lives will be decided within the space of an hour, and I am supposed to feel at ease!  Where's my faith?   It is finally D-day and 0 hour is here.  The guard opens the door and out walks this woman who is mentally tried, and nothing can be found of any hope in her face, just confusion...Did she win or lose?  It is evident that she will be waiting for quite awhile as the judge reviews her case and gives his decision at a later date.  She is wearing a full back brace and has no answers.  How in the world could I expect anything more than she has received?  I don't look anywhere near as pitiful as she.  Still I pray, "Lord, I need to know today."  The guard takes our evidence and presents it to the judge for review as we all sit outside waiting.  Will he decide to just throw the case completely out?  Anxiety is soaring to greater heights as we wait.  Now I don't want a decision at all!  If only I could get the courage to leave....I don't want to face the judgment that would soon come, as it couldn't possibly turn out good.  The guard leads us in.  Once settled, the judge is very hospitable, yet I am so intimidated.  Where's the tough guy who can get run over and laugh as the EMT's work on him?  He is nowhere to be found, and somehow, I seem to escape with him...I am there answering questions about ability to work, degree of pain, education etc., etc., yet, it is as if I am viewing this like a television show.  All was going well as I listened to the questions and my answers as a detatched observer, until one question was asked, "How do you feel as a person, a husband, and father?  How do you view yourself?"  The "me" on the stand starts out just fine, then suddenly "I" the real person am thrown into the witness seat.  No more hiding as the detatched person previously there doesn't know the answers!  Why did my attorney have to ask this one question?  The image of "me" was doing just fine on his own, but now, I would have to address issues that I never knew existed, or rather, refused to realize were there.  As I am under oath, there could no longer be any of those "Super Ego, tough guy" answers, as I had hid from for many years, and somehow had even stopped them from invading any conscious realization.  How did I feel?  As I start to reveal them in a strong stance, my foundation quickly eludes me and I find myself crying like a baby as I have to admit the failure that has been hiding behind the smiles for so long.  I was not the strong husband my wife deserves, nor was I the father who ran and played with his children.  I did not make time for them as pain has a very greedy and needy price that demands payment.  I am not a good provider and how can a man such as I am, be a good role model or adored husband.  There it was!  Sobbing and barely able to talk, I had to admit to being a total failure in life.    Finally, once I am totally unable to speak anymore, I look around at my wife for help,I was so sorry that once again I had caused her pain as I see her crying also...There could be no help.      After a minute of sobbing and silence, the judge finally interrupts with a swept down voice and says, "I have enough medical evidence and the testimony doesn't need to go any farther, I have made a decision."  At this point I know he is going to deny the benefits to someone who just didn't try hard enough at life.  He continues, "I am going to write a positive letter of allowance for disability benefits."  I try to gather myself, apologize to the judge, and with the assistance of my wife and attorney, leave the room.  They are both jubilant and I am just there.  On the elevator down to the first floor the attorney says, "I have sit in over a hundred hearings with this judge and this is the first time I have ever seen or heard of him giving a bench decision like this."    On the way home she is so happy, and I am still in shock.  We decide to stop at a restaurant/diner, and talk in solitude for a little while.  She was so excited that life could now go on, and I was still in shock from the revelations I had to discover and disclose about myself.  The gravity of it all had not hit yet.  We make it home and the kids are excited as it becomes very evident that all the worry we had been carrying, they had been sharing the load right along with us.  It amazed and saddened me to see their faces change into the faces of carefree children as opposed to the stressed countenance of a child having to see how mean the world really can be.  What kind of father allows his children to go through this?  I don't like the mirror...

      Well, my disability hearing is tomorrow (technically today), and all seems to be in place.  Haven't been able to script anything (in my mind) as directed by my attorney, but all I can do, has now been done.  Have three letters of testimony from people I trust very much.  It was very sobering reading how others saw me in light of my disability...quite hard to accept.  Anyway, the date is upon me and I truly cannot see a good end for the disability hearing.  I have the letters and quite a bit of medical proof for presentation, but it seems like these last few years nothing has ever worked out...dare I believe this might also?  At any rate, I just have to have an answer tomorrow, one way or the other, good or bad, just need an answer.....I know this particular judge is notorious for never giving a bench decision, I need to know...Seems like sanity is in the balances and time is quickly running out.

      Today was a good day indeed.  Asleep @ 4:30 and not up until 9:00 a.m.  Pain was not too out of control.  Ok, now to the living part.  My 6 yr. old daughter has hit the stage in her life where she is feeling entitled/mature, for her understandings.  Last night she brought in a toy pig on wheels centered on a serving tray.  She announced that the ham she had cooked was perfect!  My wife and I both had a slice, and it was just right!  Today she decided to get a little creative in serving her 7 & 2 yr. old sisters.  For her older sister she served a nice cold glass of salt water (at least two tablespoons in a very small glass), and for her younger sister, she got two slices of bread and covered one with salt and put the other slice on top.  This salt sandwich was served to her baby sister.  Then she commences to come in and ask for a cup of yogurt for herself as she has already taken care of the others.  She was so very proud! Here's the deal with all this.  Everyone had just eaten lunch and really didn't need to eat anything, so I told her that she needed to wait for supper, but she insisted she was hungry.  I ended up telling her to take the food and drink that her siblings for some reason didn't want.  Normally I wouldn't do this but this child is so very wasteful.  Will take a bite of something and throw the rest in the trash.  I've found an apple, peanut butter sandwich, cookies and on and on, in the trash.  So I thought I might allow her to eat and drink that which she had prepared and proclaimed was good.  Her poor face when she took that first and only bite...Man!  Then when she tried to wash it down with the salt water...I think she might have learned her lesson.  She didn't understand why normally I tell her to throw out the bread she wastes for the birds, that this time it had to go in the trash!  Such a caring child...lol

Jim, you are the "smith" who has yet to say no!  Mike, you just sparkle!  And Susan, You are on track and I will never be able to thank you enough.  Thank you all so very much!  It is official!  My thanks to you four has been made international and if someone ever reads this, then you will all be remembered.  Thank you...

      Well, Got my usual four hours of sleep and up and at it!  The wife was out early, actually a kiss and see ya later was my alarm.  Kids played out in water this morning, then wife called and told of shareholders meeting and carnival atmosphere where she was assigned, so she came home, picked us all up, and back to the carnival we went!  We all had a pretty good spot of fun.  There were games for the kids, and samples of various products...Just fun in general.  While there it blew up a pretty good storm, so we just went inside and continued on.  While inside, the kids made a pretty good defensive line which proved tough to get around (blocking the aisles).  There was one fella in particular, like us, was just there checking things out.  Nothing very outstanding...Just a normal guy.  As he met us, I told the kids to form a single line and the look on his face was the most at ease I have seen in awhile.  In the middle of all this "circus" were all kinds of representatives and product ambassadors trying to look their best and most confident.  Bending over backwards to play the part and be so inviting, yet this feller in a plain blue t-shirt impressed me the most.  His look of satisfaction in life and how he stood aside and bowed to my young daughters...Made a very big impression.  Out of it all, it was his sales pitch that I will remember.  He probably will never know it, but his simple actions will impact me for quite some time.  Back at home we watched the final in the Lord of the Rings series.  Everyone just ate what they could find and had a good kick back night.  The pain was and is quite outstanding right now.  Looks like a very long night.

      Well, so much for the pool..a few years back, we had purchased one of those inflatable pools for the family, and upon inspection, mice have made a mess of it....holes beyond repair!  Oh, well...I wish my children would learn to develop some patience.  The 12 yr old and the 7 yr old are fighting over a bowl of cereal!  The box of cereal and the jug of milk are both new!  Just seem to be fighting for the sake of the fight itself!  Ok, fight settled and all are settled.   More later...if I survive

      Sleep came @ 4 a.m., and ended @ 9....Pretty good amount of sleep!  Still it took me almost an hour to be able to get out of bed due to the pain.  Wife got all her stuff loaded and is on her way to make her appointed rounds.  Well, it is officially here and I am one year older.  Keep thinking back to former days when my dad was alive.  Always on this day would come an early morning phone call with "happy birthday" song, and offerings of value and love along with grand wishes.  He was such a good Father.  I pray that I am be half the father he was.  Always had a smile and note of encouragement.  To be the man he was...Always there.  Have to go.  Kids want to play in the water..

      Had some pretty bad predictions for tornadoes and hail yesterday, but none of it manifested.  This change in weather really affected me in pain though.    Today, we went out and had what we normally know as really good Mexican food, but today, it was as if the cook tripled the salt for every recipe.  None of us could finish our meal, and the waiter just shrugged his shoulders when we brought it up.  I was very disappointed in the quality.  My nephew has been staying with us a few days, and tonight went home.  We had some really awesome philosophical biblical discussions and have figured everything out!  Not...I was very happy with his visit.  He volunteered to do much of the yard work I can no longer do....Alongside my son, they got things very much under control.  Hey, according to the clock, it is now officially my birthday/month!  Good deal!  Am feeling a lot like an elderly youth, if that makes any sense.  Still waiting for life to work out...I am sure I will be looking back on this and other posts to check where I was in comparison to where I am.  Hopefully things will work out.  I am pondering what the attorney instructed me to do.  I am told that I need to script out some responses to questions the judge will be asking.  I am really no good at that at all.  With me, it is like I will either shoot from the hip, or simply not shoot at all.  I don't know how to script things out...Literally going through the paces, and I do so much better giving point blank answers to point blank questions.  Anyway, am praying much for deliverance from this situation I have found us in....

      Today I am hating on my condition "Fibromyalgia".  The Docs have prescribed ever increasing strengths of narcotics which  WILL  control the pain....Guess what?  They are not working....The pain is like being squeezed, pinched, burned and stabbed all at the same time and at various trigger points.  Not a happy Redneck right now!  I wonder how everyone else with painful conditions deal with it?

      One of my former schoolmates has over the last few years been fighting breast cancer and it finally went into remission this last year.  All was looking good!  I just found out that she started having trouble seeing and in investigation, they found stage 4 brain cancer.  She is having to make trips to Houston Texas for monthly treatments, which is proving very costly to the family, yet what are they to do?  A good husband and two children make up her family and it has to be so hard for them.    I have found that in these trials, the family is in just as much a battle as the one under attack.  Children will summon up strength rarely seen by those war heroes one reads about, yet remain under the cloak of age and ignorance.  The spouse strongly stands while being riddle with the bullet holes of doubt, why, and how, yet still they stand for all to lean on.  And finally the one who holds the battle within seems to almost transcend the allowances of a mere mortal.  Their courage soon becomes that of a titan who knows no defeat.    I have to wonder about and admire those who face such adversity.  The lot they drew in life has shown a fight indeed, but has given proof that life is indeed of much value...  If we all had the easy walk, would we be any richer as a society?  Would compassion and caring even exist?  Maybe the lack of appreciation would extend war and violence, and in this, bring about the titans.  In either case, it appears that heroes are a vital part of any society, by man or nature, some will have no other course than one of fire......  Walk on....

      The last few days have been wonderful! Temps in the 70's and lower 80's....my kind of weather!  Now it seems like the weather is trying to match the season as we are moving back into the 90's.  Have been thinking much about how my plans and my realities behave much like the weather.  Plans have been what one would expect, but realities are more like the extremes of of weather...either freezing cold or blistering hot.     Plan:    Work hard, move up the ladder in industry, get the old retirement plan running  (have our own business) and live life out to the end with a certain amount of security.  By now we would moved from the two bedroom starter home to a three bedroom family home and at the moment we should be in a large custom home built to fit family and allow some room for convenience.     The next phase would have been to buy a couple of  vacation homes sometime in the next ten years or so then retire, get the RV and take the grandkids hopping around the country, with an end of leaving some form of legacy and resource for the descendants.     Reality:    Managed to get a good job early on, was moving up the ladder, married a genius beauty queen, and had a   baby son on the way.  Had the starter home and good cars.  Life was on Track!      During wife's pregnancy, we were in an automoblie accident and long story short, damaged spine meant long rehab time and in the process was replaced at work....no job, in addition to having to deal with a certain degree of disability.  Son was born three months after accident.  I was now the stay-at-home dad as wife made the income... Life was off track!       After a year, managed to get a job that didn't pay much but did help my self-esteem.  This job was really physically demanding and took much out of me due to physical condition, but served to heal my spirit somewhat.  Later I left this job and went into business with an associate, which proved to be a very bad move.  We had different agenda's; he wanted to get by financially and I wanted to secure financial security for the future.  I ended up breaking the association and was again without income for family.   Was on-track for awhile, then suddenly jumps track again, but, I could at least see the track.       About a month later I land a job working with disabled and handicapped people.  Absolutely loved it, but the pay simply was not there.  I worked my way up the ladder to a position of second in command with a promise of taking lead position when present boss retired.  The pay rose sharply as well and  life seemed to be ontrack again!      While working at this job, I was hit by a car while trying to get an intoxicated girl out of a busy hiway.  Fives surgeries and a month in the hospital, I came out more disabled.  Job was still there due to the nature of the business....good thing.  Was still in "starter" home and drove older vehicles, but hope was in the air!  Wife really wanted to move to a larger home, but I kept putting her off till the top position at work was mine.  "Pay bills off now and invest with more clout later."  Seemed like a good plan to me...Yeah, that was the plan.  When my boss finally retired after grooming me somewhat, I was set for the new position, but another man "fairly new" had managed to politic his way into the position and shortly shared that he had every intention of firing me as soon as possible.  I did manage to stay until about a year after his appointment,when the company closed it's doors.  Not part of the plan at all!  I was now moving closer to middle age and my body was deteriorating due to all the damage and resulting disease.  I did manage to draw unemployment and sent out probably 300 resume's which resulted in two interviews one call to a second interview and no job.  I was too old, too gimped and too undereducated to hire.  My train was not only off-track, but my train had fallen over the side of a bridge...       What to do:    I had now fallen to a level below anything I could have ever envisioned.  Throughout my whole adult life, every last plan I tried had come unravelled...At this low point I had to do something so I applied for disability insurance and was twice denied, got an attorney and appealed.  I also went to state rehab services and found that they would help me go to college which I did.  I was now doing something and was feeling like I somewhat resembled my vision of manhood, but not fully there yet.    I worked hard in school, managed to get good grades (4.0), went to all the right doctors, got all the right meds, and physical condition kept getting worse.  The appeal was once again denied and we filed for a hearing before a judge.  A very long wait and things started looking very bad...  Finally in June we had the hearing and the Judge granted me the disability insurance.  My condition combined with the meds is continuing to cause me much pain and mental impairment, yet still I go...waiting for disability to start, loving my family, and going to college (praying for the ability to complete).   Hopefully my reality will turn for the good and I will somehow find a niche in this world of ours...
