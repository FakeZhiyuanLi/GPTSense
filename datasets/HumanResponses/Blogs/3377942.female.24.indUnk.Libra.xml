						   Ack.  I hate Mondays.    Actually, they've become something of a reprieve, seeing as darling hubby and I usually work harder on the weekends than we do during the week.  My baby turns one today...*sniff sniff*  I don't know where the last year has gone.  One of the characters in Stephen King's Dark Tower series talks about how time is no longer passing at a steady pace - it is alternately speeding up and slowing down.  That's what it feels like to me - like time is just on fast forward these days.  The days are turning into weeks so quickly, I'm afraid to blink - I might lose a whole month.  I'm working on getting a webpage set up - I used to have one, a long time ago, but I quit working on it, and over the years I've forgotten what little HTML I did know.  So...I guess that's it for now - I'd better go see what the kids are doing.  They're being quiet, which usually means that they're into something that they shouldn't be into.

						   "Hmmmm."  I was reading an article over on  urlLink Fark  the other day about the Mexican Air Force and some UFOs.  Well, they have decided that what they saw was ball lightning.  This kind of stuff fascinates me.  (One of my favorite sites is about.com's  urlLink paranormal  site - they have some information on ball lightning there)  I love reading about strange or unexplainable phenomena - ghosts, time travel, that kind of stuff.  I have always been fascinated by the occult...and I wish that I could say that I believe in ghosts, and all that stuff.  I really would like to believe...I guess that deep down, I'm not one to take anything on faith.   [Warning: Unpredictable Tangent Ahead]  I guess that explains why I am an atheist.  I was raised Catholic, but when I was about fourteen or so, I started to question...everything.  Some days I wish that I could be a mindless sheep, and just believe what I am told because I am told to.  I wish that I could believe that there was some supreme, omnipotent being watching out for me, taking care of me...but I can't.  It just doesn't make any sense.    ~sigh~  More on this later.  Duty calls.

						   ...that I was put on this earth to accomplish a certain number of things.  Right now, I am so far behind that I will never die.    I hate having sick kids.  I feel so helpless - I wish I could just take it away.  I hate having to watch them lay around, all miserable.  But it's frustrating, too.  When they're sick, they want to be held and rocked and sung to...continuously.  Which is cool - I love to cuddle them and sing to them.  It just gets difficult when they all want to be held at the same time.  And then there's the fact that it's mighty hard to get any housework done when you have three children attached to you.  You know, they say that a clean house is a sign of unhappy children...if that's true, my kids must be the happiest kids on earth.    My husband is active duty military, and we had a very close brush with him getting deployed to Iraq last week.  I'm still kind of stressed over that.  It doesn't make it any easier that I have disagreed with the decision to go to war from the get go (and believe me, that caused it's fair share of fights here at home, as my darling hubby didn't feel the same way).  Of course, my opposition to the war has nothing whatsoever to do with my support of the military - it's not like they have a choice in the matter.  Now, Bush, on the other hand...well, I won't climb up on that soapbox right now.  It could get very long and ugly, and there's no telling how much longer the kids will be napping.  If anyone happens by here, and reads this, would you leave me a comment or send an email?  I'd love to know if anyone's actually listening to my rambling...that would be hella cool.  I can't even get people to listen to me ramble in my own house.  Of course, that's probably due to the fact that they've all heard my stories so many times that now, when I start to tell one, they just cut me off and say, "Yep.  We've heard that one."

						   Cute:  When my two year old grabs the clean diaper I'm about to put on the one year old, and runs away, giggling and yelling "Ha ha!  You'll never find it NOW!!"  (If you don't get this, you obviously don't watch Dora the Explorer.)  Not so cute:  When the children all band together and perform this same stunt with my sanity.

						   ...as I lay in bed, looking at the stars, I thought - where the hell is the ceiling?  Ha.    I suffer from an acute lack of grown-up socialization - an occupational hazard of being a stay-at-home mom - and being naturally long-winded and chatty, every time I email friends or family, it turns into a (not so) short novel.  So I figured I'd try out the weblog thing.  Maybe it will give me an outlet for my chattiness. We'll see.  I'll try to get a profile and stuff up soon...as soon as my bosses lay down for naptime and give me a chance to work on this.
