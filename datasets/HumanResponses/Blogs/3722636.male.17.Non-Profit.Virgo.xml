      If love is simple  There will be no quarrels  If love is simple  There will be millions of lovers   If love is simple  Why is it complicated?      Love is complicated…. I never knew that… I really love her but due to some misunderstanding we always quarrel… *Sigh*   I dun know is it because of  me? Or is it because of her?  I really want to lead a peaceful and simple love. Well I admit that I can be really emotional at times and sensitive… Baby I need  U to be by my side all the time.. I will never leave you…
