      I started a really good book a few days ago. Its called 'Angels & Demons' by Dan Brown. Its reeeeeally cool. Go check it out sometimes. Its one of those matrixy type books. I like it, anyway.   I'm also in the process of writing this sweet song. I mean...its really cool! Well...I like it. The lyrics are real deep and meaningful to me. And the melody just totaly follows the songs meaning.   Ok, the ideas for the novel are rocking. Right now i'm just kind'a brainstorming for it and getting prepaired. I'm making it a goal to start outline by august 1st. I'm going to have the main character's profile completed by the end of this week. That will be a giant step towards outlining.  I really have to run...

      I went camping with my youth group this weekend!!! Thats why I haven't posted anything in a few days. And, yeah, it was a blast! Noah and I drew abbs on our stomachs with a red sharpie...went swimming in the creek a million times...sprayed glowing liquid stuff on each other...played kickball...played football...went paddle boating...played more kickball...sang...went crazy...and Noah, Daniel E, and I creamed the majority of Youth Group in ultimate frizbee. THere's nothing else i can really think of...but you get the picture. I just got back yesterday at like five O'clock. I"m real tired right now because I just got home from band practice.   I have to run...I'll definately do more tomorrow...more on the story thingy anyway...

      I visited the Essigs a few times yesterday and Katie seems to be doing much better. Actually, she seems better than better. She was so happy and jovial. It was such a thrill to see her enjoying herself. Continue to keep her in your prayers. She is sooooooo cool.   Okay, I know I'm a day late, but i was really busy yesterday. But, anyway, here's some stuff about the missions trip I promised to throw on here....  We arrived at Davis & Elkins College at about 6:40 and spent the rest of the evening eting pizza, singing, and playing basketball.   The next day, Daniel (Esig) and I were ordered to dig a a path for a drain box in sinking sand. Worse. It was like 200 degrees out...so we went half naked. By the end of the day we covered in mud from a few aggressive negotiations...anyway, we had sunburn allover our backs with spots scattered white spots the size mrables of where the mud used to be. We went around guarding our backs the rest of the week...especially from nick...jk.  Nothing else great happened until Whendsday, except for scraping and painting a small church. That night, us guys, Daniel (Essig), Noah, Nick, Isaac, and I stripped down to our boxers and held a few gladiator wars with pillows. It was so fun, Then Isaacs like if anybody goes running down the hall past th girls dorm i'll do it too, and so were all like 'yeah, we'll do it' and so we ran out our door and up and down the hall. Isaac screamed like a girl the entire time. Sarah saw us as she came up from the steps. It was so funny. She was like 'Ahhhhhhhhh!' It was really funny. THe rest of the night was spent singing 'All in All' to different versions of music. LIke Death metal, Rap, Country...you get the picture. Isaac played guitar.   Thursday, I was sent from my normal job to a church that i had helped put a roof on last year. Anyway, Mr. Ward sent me up into the bell towar where the handed me panels to screw in.   On friday night, we got these hanks pop bottles and filled each with a different amount of water and paraded around the dorms composing lullabylic tunes...sorta. IT was really fun. Then noah and i sang 'what do you do with a drunken salor' from our dorm window, and Noah satrted yelling to Isaac and Jen down below. THen he decided to give them a scare so Nate held Noah out the window, to make sure he didn't fall out the window, and Noah started unzipping his pants. Anyway, Mr. Birchler came in cause we were being too loud and Nate let go of Noah and dove behind the couch and Noah didn't seem to notice. And Daniel was like 'Noah? Uh...Noah? Noah?' and Noah finally turned around with his flys down and saw mr burchler and ran to a corner where he could zip up his pants. LOL!  THats about it for events. Probably one of the coolest things that happened to me was that we all got a salt shaker witrh a person's name in it. Whatever person we got, we were supposed to encourage and pray for. I got Katie's! I was so happy! But just because the missions trip is over doesn't mean i have to stop praying for her.   The Lord is so good!

      up to a few minutes ago, my plan for tomorrow was to go mow the church lawn with Kate, but they were canceled. She's been having trouble with her back for about a year now, and tonight, its much, much worse. Just got off the phone with her Dad, Mr. Dave Essig and he says its really bad right now. So bad that she may not be mowing anymore...at all. There's even an outside chance that she'll be having surgery. If you are reading this, I beg you to pray for Katie. She deserves so, so much. She's the coolest person alive. The moment you meet her, you'll be dying to be her friend. Please, please, please keep her in your prayers. There's no way you can ignore this. SHE DESERVES MORE THAN A PRAYER OR A MUTTERED 'GET WELL.' SHE DESERVES A HAPPY, ENJOYABLE LIFE. AND NO ONES GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY. SHE HAS CHRIST.  Again, I beg you to pray for her whenever you are called to do so. shut down the moniter and pray for her right now. please. it would mean the world to me...

      Wow! I had such a busy week and a half. And I have evaluating and mowing tomorrow. Yeah. thats my life. Had a really fun day hanging out with Adam and Becca today, though. We convinced all these people that Becca and I were twins...and adam was our cousin. It was crazy. AND THEY BELIEVED US! Becca and Adam are so cool.   Well, for now, I'm going to work on a post about all the crazy things I did at the missions trip...it'll be up in a few...

      yeah, mowing is in the bag...or...uh...past, I mean.   THis is probably going to be my last post for awhile, considering the fact I'm leaving tomorrow after church for West Virginia (mountain mama, take me home, country road...-yeah, I know that song). Anyways, I'll be back on saturday, the 19th. So...asta-levesta for now...or how ever you spell it. Wait, I'm not leaving yet. How about I save the goodbyes for the end?  For now, more stuff on the story...  The girls name is...(drum roll)...wait. I'll figure that out later. Lets see. Alot of this is just vision after vision that you can't exactly trace onto paper. Not now anyway.   I think there will be alot more time travel, and even wrping, than I thought there would be. I hope to have alot done when I get back.  I have to run. So...asta-levesta baby...

      The weed wacker was having some major fits today, which isn't unsual in itself, its just that it almost fell apart so now I have to go back there with our weed wacker and finish it up. I also missed a spot when mowing part of the hill near the playground. Guilty. Yup.  Anyway, I thought of some cool stuff for the novel thingy. Can't wait til the outline's done. I'll post more about it later...

      About to go mowing with Kate. Katie's one of my really cool, really fun friends, we mow lawns and tease each other...its fun...  Well, I think my main character is going to be female. Probably in her early twenties, with problems. I guess she'll play one of those classic 'Peter Parker' roles just with a better life situation. Yeah. Anyway, she's able to see other people's future. Anything's future. As simple as reading a book.   Well, as you may have guessed, no one really believes her except for a few close friends. She tries to prove herself but can't. Somehow, she'll mess up something big by trying to save the city from a catastrophy and gets in trouble with the police or something. She gets found out by someone else from another place...  Anyway, I have to run, literally. Kates coming over real soon and I haven't showered or anything...

      Well, I tried to post something earlier but the thing wouldn't work, so I watched a movie called 'The Family Man' instead. It was kind'a funny, interesting, and a bit moving. Besides that, there's nothing going...  I have a really cool idea for a novel, though. Yeah. You heard me. I didn't say flash or novellette, I said N-O-V-E-L. Anyway, I think its pretty sweet. I'll try to post some stuff about it on here since its going to be such a big hit. I wish. Hey, no laws against dreaming...  Here's a bit about it...  Ok, the setting is usually in modern day...on earth. Sometimes, it'll be on other worlds. Actually, more like other 'peoples minds' really, if that makes sense. Its going to be awhile before I finish the outline. It'll also be very confusing.   Anyway, I'm to tired to post anymore. I'll sleep on it and see what happens...

      Katie's Birthday was today. She looked like she was enjoying herself. I wished her "Happy Birthday" like five times. Seriously. Then, later, when they got home, i called her on the phone and sang her Happy Birthday. I hope she's having a great day. I don't know for sure though. &nbsp; Bedtime (stay-up-and-read time)...

      Anyway, I gave Katie her present yesterday. Her birthday is actually on sunday, but she really wanted this book and she was thinking about buying it the next time she rode to wal-mart...so I gave it to her early. I think she liked it. From what I've heard, she read it for soooo clong last night. Her mom said taht she loved the card. She was going on and on about it. Thats good, because I was up till 2 am making the card for her. yeah, i'm pretty happy about that. I'll be seeing her pretty soon. She's so cool. She just rocks.   So, anyway, EARLY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, KATIE! ROCK ON!

      I'm so bored right now, but Caley just logged on and I haven't talked to him on AIM before. So...its pretty sweet.   Thomas spent the night last night. It was really fun. We went to the essigs, watched paycheck, jammed, ate, jammed some more, watched spiderman, slept, watched the 'dead poetic' video, and Thomas beat me in a game of slap. Yeah. Thats what we did. Not exactly in that order, though.   Katie, Virginia, Becca, Bethany, Angela, Aaron, and Thomas and I are going to see Spiderman II tomorrow. This will be my second and LAST time. Its like one of my favorite movies, though.   man, I never realized how bad I want to be in a band till recently. Its just bveen on my mind. How I would perfect that band and shape and mold it into the ultimate band. A dream. I've been writing lyrics lately. Maybe I should post some on here...

       Advice for Guys   June 01, 2004  If you are impatiently waiting for your female friend, girlfriend, wife, I have advice for you. Nagging is hopeless, but there is a way to get her in gear. Now, keep in mind that this strategy only works when they are eating and you are waiting.For instance, If you really want to see Spider-Man 2 on opening night and you are worried that all the good seats will be taken, tell your female friend, girlfriend, wife, that "if she keeps on eating, she will get fat." Trust me, she will stop immediatly and you could watch your movie.  By the way, Spider-Man 2 is better than the original.   -- -- --  I can't really get over this subject. I mean, you could've walked past your future wife 5 times in Wal-mart and not even notice it. I mean, you could have gone to school with her during Pre-K. I don't know, but the possabilities  seem  endless. ITs just one wierd subject. Or maybe its just me. Maybe I think to much. I'm confusing.

      I spent the night at Droo's house monday night. It was so fun. Dain, Droo, and I played eachother in Warcraft III and Battfield: Vietnam. I was like the worst player, but I did get much better in the Vietnam game. By Tuesday morning I was the best shot out of us three. But I was also the stupidest player. Haha. My name was "!!Don't shoot!!." Yeah. It was cool. Droo and I played Rune till like 5:30 in the morning. Droo also showed me some sweet new bands and music videos. I think we watched 'New Medicines' by Dead Poetic, 'Rose of Sharyn' by Killswitch Engage, and some Funeral for a Friend song like a billion times.   Anyway, a whole bunch of other people went out to see spiderman 2 when I was gone. I was planning on seeing it with all of them on friday, but they decided to see it on monday instead. But Droo's house was a blast.  Thomas is coming over today to spend the night and we might be going to the Essigs for a game night. Can't wait!

      Today was cool. I called Dan's cell at like 8:45 to check in and got told to take Sarah's place in teh hospitality comittee, which was pretty lame because there was like no food. Isaac drove me down to his apartment in New Brighton. I watched this crazy sweet guy with horns all over his body who would play likie classical music by turning his head and squeezing his armpits and stuff...yeah, it was pretty crazy. There was also this girl who could do the stacking cup thing in 8.2 seconds! It was insane. Anyway, since the Vanderplaats were in town, at the wards house, all these people came over to hang out. Isaac and Noah showed off a pretty impressive set of fireworks, while Ben shot hhis bottle rockets off into the trees. The best news of the day was definatly the fact that the Essigs and Dan got back safely! I guess Dan didn't get much sleep, cuase he's in bed right now. I can't wait to here what all of them have to say about the trip. Also, today was Leah's birthday! Happy Birthday, Leah!   Not much else going on. I'll post more if I feel like there's anything worth posting...

      I'm reading this book, Angels & Demons, and it has this uprising of the biggest satanic cult ever. Anyway, there's some really interesting stuff I'm finding. I'll post more tomorrow when I have time.   Anyway, I can't wait till Dan and the Essigs get back from Springfield, OH. Ther coming backk tomorrow! yay! I really miss all of them. I think I'm gonna call Dan at like 5am tomorrow and wish him a happy July 4th. Thats going to be cool. Maybe it'll make the others laugh.   We saw fireowrks across from the Geneva football stadium. They weren't bad, just short. 12 minutes long!  My dad and I tried to get the vbs sign up for our church, but could find the right kind of stakes.   Oh, yeah. I changed my email address today... strong_bad531@hotmail.com yeah, I know. Awsome, isn't it. jk.  Gonna read, write, and crash. Catch ya'll...  I CAN'T WAIT TILL MY BRO GETS BACK WITH THE ESSIGS!

      I arrived at the church for play practice late, as usual, this morning. Katie's still in Columbus, Kathyren is...still away, and Allie was...somewhere. So the only people that were there to practice were just Thomas and I. So, yeah, we went through events 1-3 like a million times before going downstairs to munch on donuts.   I spent the rest of my beofore-evening time painting a sign for vbs with Becca (Shaw). At like 2 o'clock we finaly got home. My dad told me to mow, so I clipped a tree real badly and almost crashed the garage door.   But now I have to go to the Church again to help put up the signs. Catch ya'll later...

      Making a website right now...because I'm bored and have nothing better to do. Well, I'm also talking to Trey and Droo...so it ain't bad. The site is going to have all the stuff about my story idea. Its only a temperary site though. Thomas  said  he'd make one for me...atleast get me started...I think.  I'm soooo bored right now. I think I'll be copycat and write down some random comments.  -1- I hate it when novels or films have something that doesn't help out the plot or story or anything...its just there...  -2- One word. Through2u. Actually, its kind'a like three...no, its one...kind'a...  -3-  I like writing (.) like this.......................................................  -4- I read horror novels, then turn around and read Jane Austin books...  -5- I'm probably going to change my email soon because lycos totally did some late spring cleaning on their site and i hate it. so it'll probably be something like... strong_bad@blablabla.com  -6- I'm bored  -7- I plan on getting married when I'm older. That is, if any girl will have me...  -8- I wish I was older...  -9- One of my dreams is to be a published author. However, being Spiderman would totally rock. But there is ONE goal in my life that I will not write down. Because if I told you, I'd have to kill you...  -10- I've proved a theory...Matt knows how to coun't to ten and put(-) before and after numbers. Pretty cool, huh?  -11- I don't want to go to bed, but my time is almost up...  Ok. That post is long enough. My mom needs to get on, and I need to get to work on my novel thingy. Ya know, my story idea could use a name. How about something like...Crimson Secret...nah, too majestic...what about...Kimnar...or something?...wait. I got it. Crimson Secret! Its brilliant. ok, its decided. Crimson Secret. cya...

      It was sooooo good! I recomend you see it. Its worth the green George Washingtons. Man, it was so good. It emotional, lots of action, good acting and good directing. Probably one of my favorite movies.  At the theatre, they showed a preview for Blade Trinity! It looks awsome! I won't to see it real bad now. check out the site...but, I warn you, its about vampires and stuff...so enter at your own risk... http://www.bladetrinity.com yeah, it looks pretty sweet!   Anyway, enough gory love movies...I keep forgetting to post something thats really important to me...very close to my heart...EXTREMELY close to my heart...yes...I did get a haircut. haha. jk. I mean, yeah, I did. I'm still getting used to it. Its like shorter than my friend austin's hair...  Still working on my novel, and I got some real sweet ideas. The main character's partner is going to be a vampire. Its going to be so fun.   I'm going to publish this post before it gets to long...

      I'm leaving at 11 for the movie. It starts at like 11:30, but it onlyt takes like 7 minutes to get there...so, yeah. THats what I'll be doing soon.   I'm basicly done with my song. I'll probably add a part after one part to make it sound better and to make the song longer. Maybe I'll post the lyrics on here...  Oh, yeah.  Mental note:   Be sure to pray for Trey and his friend. He hasn't told me who she is because I know her and she threatened to commit suicide. So there's someone with her 24/7. Its pretty sad...but she needs prayer. So please pray for her...because she needs it...  I'm working on a website with www.freewebs.com right now. Its pretty cool. I'd like to get more options. But, hey, what do you expect from a free website program. Its not bad. I think I'm getting used to it. The address to the site I'm working on is... www.freewebs.com/mattswritings so check it out...Its under construction right now, but you can go there and see it if you feel up to it...  I have to take out teddy, so catch ya'll later...

      ok, I know...That was like the lamest title ever, but its all history now. And so was that sentence. As was that sentence. Yeah, I think that was even lamer.  Well, I'm going to definately work on some stuff for the novel tonight. Hope to get alot done. I'm seeing Spiderman 2 tomorrow with some friends...Trey, Dana, and Droo. I already read the book, so I already know what happens, but I'm still dying to see it.  Also, the ESSIGS left for columbus today to see family. Daniel hitched a ride with them too...so I have the room to myself. Gee, I already miss him.  I really feel like writing stuff about my novel idea on here, but alot of it has to just be stuffed together menatally. I don't know...I keep having different ideas...I thinjk I should write them all down and compare them sometimes...  Oh, yeah. the first Silence Effect fan site was created yesterday by Joey Squire. Its really cool. check it out at... www.freewebs.com/sefan Yeah, its pretty sweet...  Well, gotta run. Keep rockin...

      I though about my novel a lot yesterday. I figured some cool things out. I want the main character to have a low life with no family or friends. But i'm not sure if someone should find her or she should find them. Ya know? Well, Bethany really ants to get on and i know that was a really lame and short post, but I need to run...I promise to post more later today...
