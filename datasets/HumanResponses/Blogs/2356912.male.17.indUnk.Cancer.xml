      Current Mood: Good Current Music: Mortal Kombat Annhilation - MK Theme (Chicken Dust remix)  Well I saw Walking Tall today, The Rock is awsome, When I used to watch wrestling I liked him, I like him as an actor too, cause he can kick major ass. Iv seen Rundown, He was great in there. But the story of Walking Tall was a bit slow. The action came after a while. It was still a good movie though. There were some funny parts in it too, Overall it was a pretty good movie.  After that we ate at Taco Bell, As usual we usually always go there, I like it.   Well I ordered the Protien Shake yesteday as you know. It will arrive on Monday, hopefully before I have to weight lift so I can start using it. Cant wait to see the results. I know it wont be instant results, But I mean in a year or 2.       Im aiming for The Rock, Yeah laugh it up, My chest muscles are there too, I saw it today when I took off my shirt. Yeah, Im getting there. Itl take more tehn 2 years to be as big as The Rock, But il get there lol.. My dad asked me a interesting question when we were talking. He asked me who my Role Model is, I was blanked out, because I never thought about it. So know I think about this question a lot. Who is my role Model? I dont know who it is. Well thats all for now.  -Peace, Ku

      Current Mood: Very Ku :D Current Music: Rudraksh - Rudraksh The Seed of power(Full title)  I decided to just order the Protien Shake from Online.  So I got the RIch Choclate flavor, They didnt have Orange or Id get that. I got 2.2 lbs though, Not 5, Cause I wnated to try it first. I hear its good for you body after weight lifting, If you get your right ammount of protien you grow bigger.  Basicly: Drink Before Working out (1 scoop) and Drink after Working Out(2 scoops) Wellit depends on how much Protien you need to fingure out how much you should take. Man its all I need to get more pumped up. Been working out for 3 years and it isnt growing as fast as I imagined.  Well Im out. Mosre later today If I get time. -Peace, Ku

      Current Mood: Ku Current Music: Linkin PArk, Meteora - Breaking a Habbit  Well, Today, I went to the orthodontist, I got in some bans for my lower teeth, and my upper one will be put in next 2 weeks I guess. Aboiut the title. Well I saw Baghban today.. Its a great movie. Baghban meaning Gardner.   Baghban---------------     After retirement, Raj Malhotra (Amitabh Bachchan) expects his four sons to take care of him and his wife Pooja (Hema Malini). He’s invested all his money in their well-being, but in return, they create a sorry situation for their parents. Directed by Ravi Chopra and produced by B R Chopra, Baghban is a predictable tale reminiscent of the Rajesh Khanna-Shabani Azmi film Avtaar. Yet, despite the cliches, it’s an identifiable and realistic story, boosted greatly by Amitabh’s outstanding performance and the ever-so-gorgeous Hema Malini’s dignified portrayal. Obviously, Chopra is trying to extend a television-friendly theme to the large screen. Raj has been happily married to Pooja for 40 years, and after retirement, wants to spend time with any of his sons (Aman Verma, Samir Soni, Sahil Chadha, Nasir Khan). The sons initially try to please him thinking he’ll offer them money, but when they realise he has little, they hesitate in taking their parents home. Raj and Pooja end up staying separately, singing songs over the phone as their sons and daughters-in-law make life miserable. Though the first half is stale, the film is lifted considerably when Raj decides to write a book about such a family. Neat performances by Paresh Rawal and guest star Salman Khan add to the impact, along with some hummable Aadesh Shrivastava tunes. Despite a tacky look and extra soppiness, the film is worth a watch – thanks mainly to Amitabh, who gives one of his best post-’90s performances.    Source:Mid-Day   ---------  It got me thinking of family values.. How the cycle is, That In the beggening The Parents take care of you and then when we become older its our responsibility to take care of them. I hope I dont end up liek htem, I will try hard not to, Because my parents have done a lot to help me, Sometimes they are too protective, But its their love that makes me feel good. WEll al of ya are probably thining of me as a geek or something. I don't care..  Anyways, Enough of the emotional stuff, I don't like talking about emotional stuff. Well Today, I went to my school for my senior pictures, The Life TOuch company reschedualed. So I have to call them again and ask when I have to come. I havent walked yet, So Im about to go and walk on the tredmil for a bit.  -Peace, Ku

      Yo Wassup guys? Its Tuesday I think...lol Its Summer, I dun keep up. Well I found a video of our Family memories, from 1998 - 2000. Iv gotta say, I looked really cute back then. lol. Im handsome now tho 8 ) . Well I saw many people in our family, I began to realize the way life goes depending on 1 single desicion. My cousin Dharmesh, He was over-weight then and now hes so ku, Muscular and loooks really good, married and has a kid comming. He took up the desicion to lose weight and he stuck with it. And he really inspired me, Its a great acheivment now that you look at it. I was a great little kid though, I was bindas back then, meaning do what ever I want, not caring what people think. When I wanted to dance, Id dance, crazy too. Your life is in your own hands, Thats what I learned, Especally with all the ciggerete and drug use. I said when I was a kid that I would never do drugs in my entire life, and I have made it through so far, And I will carry it out, So when I grow older I can be a good example for the next generation. Well thats all I have to say for now.  -Peace, Ku

      Wassup guys? Well I left a lot of things out last time I posted. For the whole summer, I have been to Universal Studios. I thought it was fun. The Spider-man ride was ku, I cant remember the others.. lol......atleast the names. Then when we went to Daytona Beach we had fun at the beach, I had fun spending most of my time with my parents, I realized what iv been missing while not spending much time with them. Its a great thing. Ofcourse most americans or other religion people might disagree, But all indians usually spend most of their time with their family. Its our culture. Well anyways At the Baby shower last weekend, I had a blast doing the song "Gori Gori".  I havent been able to tell you guys about Bollywood, Its like Hollywood but for Indians. I have a few favorites. Fav. Actors   The first one is Aamir Khan, Hes been my fav since I was in india.  Second is Vivek Oberoi Then theres Big B (Amitabh Bhachan) and Little B(Abhisbek Bachan) Astress: I have 3: Rani Mukherjee Rani Mukherjee Oh and Did I say Rani Mukherjee  I saw Gayab (Invisible) yesterday, It was pretty Good. Tushar Kapoor was aight I guess, I dun liek him all that much. And Now for Hollywood.  I saw Spider-man 2, I gotta say, that movie kicked ass. Way better then the first. I liekd Spider-man since I was a little kid. Hes been my heero. I also saw I, Robot, that movie was pretty good. The movie was funny at times. The overal story was good too. I liked it a lot.   Well Thats all for now. -Peace, Ku

      Throughout the ages, this relationship has stood the test of time. Rituals, ceremonies, cultures, technology changed, but that special bond that a child has with it's mother remains unaltered.  What makes this bond so strong? so special?.  It cant be because the mother loves the child more than the father does, as love for the child is unconditional from both sides. The more logical reason would be the impact that the mother has on the first 9months of the child's unborn life. The child is a PART of the mother, they are one and the same. The needing relationship of the child/mother begins as soon as it is conceived and never stops, even after the umbilical cord is cut. This 9months forms a permanent bond between the child and mother. Quite honestly, I am jealous. Women often complain about the inconveniences of pregnancy and child birth.... and it's quite understandable. But I wouldn't mind going through with it, if it meant that I would know my child better than anyone in the world.  It might be taken as a cliche when your mother says "I know you 9months more than you know yourself", but .. IT'S TRUE.  More Later.....

I always say a family need diversity and thats how im going to be.  I cant wait 'til Ria can interact with me so i can make her laugh.  Even if i dont say anything funny she will laugh and make me feel good.  But i always say funny.  Well i will sign again.  PUNJABI FO' LIFE!!!!!

      Hummm...where should I start from.  Well, food seems to be a very big issue during pregnancy.  What type of food is good for the baby, eating nutritional food, what will help the baby grow, blahblahblah !!!  From my personal experience during pregnancy, I dont have a choice on what types of food to eat.  Even before pregnancy I personally never liked vegetables or Indian food (because alot of veggies are involved) and now especially during this stage I dont feel like eating indian food as much.  Maybe my baby will end up eating alot of veggies or maybe she won't, who knows ! The point is, I don't like veggies, so dont make meeeeeeeeeeee eat it. ( I admit I am a little picky about food-just a tiny bit)  Since Dharmesh will eat anything, I dont mind if the baby takes after him for food preferences. (just don't go over board with food, otherwise she will regret later) :-)  Dharmesh should feel lucky because I did not get any type of cravings.  The baby should thank me later for not eating certain foods since it will be a problem later, such as WATERMELON AND BANANAS (these two are small examples).  I loooooove both of those fruits and couldn't wait till summer came so I can gulp down a whole watermelon, but me being so sweeeeeet, I gave them up for my little girl so she won't end up having a cold (old wives tale if during pregnancy eating too much watermelon or bananas or cantolope in the last 3 months, the baby comes out with a COLD) I guess my three months sacrifice will help the baby for her rest of her life.  (ain't I sweeeeeet).  Ok bahut ho gaya, ab mujhe bhook lag gayee khane ke baare mein sochteh sochteh !! :-)

      So what are some thoughts on eating habits of the mother-to-be while she carries the baby?  Would it be fair to the child that the mother eats food that the baby might not like when it grows up? More importantly, would it fair to the mother to change her eating habits to give the baby a choice.  What I am trying to say is...Let's say that you eat chicken while you're pregnant, now wouldnt that be forcing the baby to eat chicken?  What if the baby turns out to be vegetarian, can she REALLY make a claim that she is vegetarian, when the foundation of her life; her initial growing process was done on chicken and fish?  I am not pulling towards either side, but it's an interesting thought.  More to come........

      Forgot to update :/ Ria is now in full motion for the past couple of days.  According to Sami you can see the stomach move while Ria is moving around in there.  The movement is so much sometimes..that she cant even get a good nights sleep (poor Sami :( ).  She has also started getting a lot of heartburn, which they say  means that the baby is growing hair.  Our baby is growing, and in about 8 -9 weeks will be between us.  Cant Wait.  Dharmesh

      Well I enjoyed alllll the attention I was getting in my baby shower, especially the presentssssss.  Eventhough it was no use unwrapping them because first of all they weren't for me and I couldn't do anything with the gifts after opening them.  But over all I am so happy to see that our baby is so much loved even before coming into this world, can't imagine after she has arrives she will be spoiled completely.  I think I will be the bad guy in parenting because Dharmesh is going to do whatever she wants, she will have him dance on her fingers (not unless I can help it). :o)  The party was great but I did not like the baby shower ritual (i dont know how to spell "baby shower" in hindi - God-Bharai). Anyhow, I liked the idea of walking down the stairs on Saree which seemed like walking on Red Carpet, but I did not like the slapping seven times tradition (that kinda hurts and a little insulting).  Its like I am getting punished for getting pregnant..hehehe !!  I think I have to ask my Mother-in-Law about this but I am sure I wont like the explaination.    Oh well, besides that I caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan't wait till our baby is born.  Hopefully dharmesh will start setting up Ria's room this weekend, since I cant pick up anything myself (I am helpless).  I want my baby's room to be light purpleeeeee, Ok dharmesh !? Eventhough Ria will sleep in our room first couple of months then in Mom's room so no need to set up the baby's room but I want to do something for my baby before it arrives.  Will see !  Thats it for today will write more tomorrow.

      ---------> What I would like My Ria to be   1) Personality - I don't want my baby to experience different family genes, unless Ria picks up only the beautiful genes from three different families. She should pick up definately MY SMILE :-) (no offence anyone).  The patience can go on her dad because girls should have LOTSSSSS of patience in order to deal with different types of people, especially after marriage.  Since I don't have much patience I can relate to it.  So hopefully my Ria will end up a cool, calm, and patient.  2)Physically - I don't want my baby to be very "Feminine".  I want a girl with attitude so people think twice before messing with her, but I dont want her to be a "Tom boyish" either.    Lunch time, Ria's hungry for some gulab jamun.... :-) more later !

      The family is starting to gather around now :-)   I will change the description of the blog from "A loving couple" to "A loving Family" to reflect this change.  Discussions/Thoughts of the day:  1) The reason I choose the title as I, Ria (no it's not to copy the movie I, Robot), is to wonder what personality would Ria have? Would she go more on the Ahuja family....Topiwala family or the Bulsara family? As the generations keep growing, the arriving child gets a much bigger gene pool to swim in.  For eg., Ria will have the option to aquire from ALL the gene pools that I have been a part of + ALL the gene pools that Sami has been a part of.  However scary that may sound, it wont be that hard to figure out who she is imitating when she exhibits a certain behaviour. Keeping that in mind... I would like for each one of you to list the following:  	a) Physical Characteristics 	b) Personality (Good) 	c) Personality (Bad)  Maybe...just Maybe..we'll get an idea of what she CAN have.  We'll start with me, and It would be cool if you guys/gals can comment with yours.   **Dharmesh Topiwala (Dad-to-be)**  -Physical Characteristics-: Tall (5'10), Broad, Long Nose ( :---) ), Hairy, huge calves (naturally), long eye lashes, long and fast growing finger nails, uneven body (right side is higher and shorter then the left side), no upper lip, square face structure, vascular (lots of veins, even when I was big), huge hands, big feet.  -Personality (Good)-: Confident, Patient, Intelligent (I think), Loving, Caring.  -Personality (Bad)-: None .. hah J/k.  Moody, Bad temper, Jealous, Sometimes..TOO carefree.  I am sure there are more, as Sami and others will point out..and I will happily update :-) .   2) Ria will also do something that no doctor, or scientist can do. It will make blood relatives of two separate families.  For eg., Priyesh and Kunal will be blood related to Angad and Arjun through Ria. Such a little life..possesses so much power.  More later...  Dharmesh

      Well, I'm supposed to tell you about how I can't wait till Ria is born :) "I can't wait till Ria is born" :) ok bye!          ok I'm just kidding :D  Not about the part where I can't wait though.. it will be awesome!  I know one day I will be in the same position as Dharmesh-bhai and will be exponentially more excited!  Wow, I'm a geek.  Anyway, that will be really great, but until then I will make do with what I have ;)  We need to start planning the dance early.  I think this time we should do one that even the baby can enjoy.  After all, its HER party!  Well, bye for real now Bigger better post from Dharmesh bhai tomorrow :) -Me

      So...I have returned. So much for all those nay sayers who thought I wouldn't keep up with it (Which would be nobody BTW). Couple of things I've been thinking lately, and thought I would share:  1) I don't know about any other parents-to-be, but Sami & I are already madly in love with the baby. Every little move, every little kick is special. So much care and love goes in, even BEFORE the baby is born. Now one would think that our parents went through the same things when we were in the womb. Now that we are all grown up, we sometimes get mad or say mean things to them, without realizing the amount of care and love that went into us as babies and teenagers. I guess it the circle of life...takes a parent to know a parent. I don't even know our baby personally , but I know if she got mad at me, it would hurt my feelings. Live &amp; Learn I guess....Live & Learn.  2) Gift Registries..... that concept apparently eludes the Indian community. The fact that someone would tell you exactly what they want to receive as gifts is apparently mind boggling. They still like to keep the element of surprise in giving gifts (not in a good way, I might add). Obviously, what do WE know about what WE want, they know us WAY better than that. I think they should put that power to good use, cause god knows the world can use some good mind readers right about now. It's not even about the money.... I mean we have gifts registered all the way from $9.99 to $199.99. A $9.99 bib set would do us a lot more good then ....let's say..A photo frame ??? Well ...A lot more to say on that subject.. but you get the drift.  Well...more later...  *edit*  Noticed something during lunch time. Walking with a pregnant woman changes the way people look at you. Everyone is nice to you all of a sudden. That's strange... but I'm taking Sami everywhere I go from now on :-)  *edit2*  3) Would having a kid  be more like playing god or guardian?  You give life, you shape life, and then you watch the results.  If you think about it....ever single one of us gets to play god in our lifetimes.  So I wonder, why do we worship something that we ourselves possess the power to do?  We can Give Life (Birth) We can Shape Life (Raise Kids) We can Take Life (Kill) We have the determination and skills to even perform miracles. (child birth, space travel, self healing)  So why dont we take the energy we put into praying and use it to better ourselves.  Make ourselves better parents, better educators, better protectors, better scientists.  I dont know why...maybe someone can enlighten me.  I am not saying that god doesnt exist...I dont want to touch that subject :-)

      So, I decided to start a blog.  I was thinking of a way to jot down all the preparation and excitement that our family shares, waiting for the arrival of our baby.  Oh ... BTW...I should mention that my wife of almost 2 years (Sami) is 7 months pregnant with our DAUGHTER.   I cant wait for her to arrive.  I will spoil her rotten.  Had the baby shower this weekend, and it was a boat load of fun.  We hosted a party at India Palace II restaurant in Morrisville, and a lot of family members showed up.  Looking at all the family together, gets me to notice...how each generation seems to get further apart from each other, and the rest of the family.  It's really sad, because that's a great part of being Indian.... is the family ties.  I will try my best to make sure that the generation that FOLLOWS me, will be better kept in touch with their uncles, aunts and cousins.  Anyways...enough of the sappy stuff, and more about the party.  It was a blast... there were many individual performances.  One in particular surprised me.... My cousin Priyesh.  I have always thought of him as a more reserved kind of a person...caring...but reserved.  His dancing in the party will be one of the best memories of how much fun the party really was.  My sister Dolly also partook in a dance, which also surprised me..in a good way.  All in all , everyone did a excellent job in showing their happiness through their dancing.  Me & Sami would like to heartfully thank (In no particular order :) ) Dolly, Priyesh, Kunal, Tushar, Smruti,  Angad, Arjun, Paul, Mannu, Hannu, Deserie(sp?), Sukku, Pooja and Palak for their dances.  Hope you guys had as much fun as I did.  I will try to update this blog as I decide to share more information/ feelings about the coming baby, and events surrounding.  Dharmesh Topiwala Son, Brother, Husband, Father (to be)
