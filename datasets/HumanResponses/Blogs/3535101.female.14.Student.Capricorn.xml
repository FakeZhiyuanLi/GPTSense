      TITLE: Thursday AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-10-30 14:05:07 ----- BODY: Well OBVIOUSLY its Thursday.  Today has been a pretty gosh durn good day!  I didn't have any homework so thats cool.  I have nothing to do today except relax! But my Megan isn't here. That makes me really sad! I wish she was still here. I had to walk through my school alone today! Well some of the time I had Brittney or somebody else but I still felt alone without Megan!  Maybe Megan and I are to attached...I don't know.  I got to see Josh (my boyfriend) yesterday.  That was cool.  We did the usual.....sat down and watched TV.  Thats getting really old. We never do anything else. Seriously! I didn't mind at first but now its just boring. My mom doesn't care if we go out and do things but we never do. We went to a homecoming dance and we've gone to his house for a barbecue before but nothing else. It really bugs me because he has a car but its not doing him any good really! But thats ok. I'll deal. Hes still cool and fun and cute!  I found out Jared (my ex-boyfriend and Joshs old best friend) got a girlfriend....sort of! They kissed and everything...I know thats not that big of a deal but it is for Jared because he had never kissed me. We dated for 6 months and then he goes and kisses this girl he wasn't even dating at the time! That mad me really mad. That had been one of the reasons that I broke up with him! But whatever.  I don't care. I know why I broke up with him and I still know why I miss him but they weigh each other out. I need a guy where the good outweighs the bad!  Like Jason. I miss Jason.  Hes my other ex! Hes really awesome. Hes cute, nice, funny, smart, has a car, hes determined, and he has many other good qualities...the only problem is he is 19!  So I can't be with him it sucks. Supposedly we're meant for each other I'm not sure about that but I do know I love him! To bad though! WELL TOMORROW IS HALLOWEEN! I can't wait! Its gonna be so much fun!  Well g2g Katrina (my sis) is bugging me to get off!  ----- -------- TITLE: Mah AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-01 05:54:27 ----- BODY: Its really early in the morning!  Its 7:40! I can't believe I'm awake I got like zero sleep last night. Yesterday was Halloween!  There were alot of people at my house, actually they are still here but they are asleep. Brittney was here.  Shes in my room watching TV. Shes the reason I'm awake urgh! I'll start from yesterday. Ok we went Trick or Treating. I got the most candy it was pimp. Then we came home and were gonna watch scary movies all night, but Brit got tired. I was like well you can go to sleep in my room and she did and I went with her because I wasn't gonna be a bad friend and let her go in there all by her self.  I was really hyper and couldn't I was awake until like 4 or 5 this morning....longer then all the other people who were here.  Then Brit woke me up at like 7! It was so messed up. Now I'm sick and its making me mad and I started my period so my back hurts and I have cramps! it was a great day!  ----- -------- TITLE: lalala AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-02 14:59:52 ----- BODY: I didn't really do anything today. At like 1 this morning I like knocked myself out on my bed frame, it was dark ok! Then I went to Tomies. I didn't do the Kung Fu stuff because I was sick so I just hang out with the little kiddies!  lol that sounded funny. Then we played Squadren. I have 2 characters, 1 is a telepathic mute and the other is WONDERWOMAN...or SUPERWOMAN real strong and damn sexy!  My mind one almost died today. Our enemy is out to kill me BIG TIME! Its really sad.  Then I came home. Nothing interesting going on here. I called Josh no answer. Sad sad. I have to bake cookies now...my mom just left for a DATE and I want Josh to come over but no go.  Oh yeah and last night I had a strange dream about me drinking A LOT of alcohol....hmmmm........... ----- -------- TITLE: Sick AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-04 07:58:39 ----- BODY: These last two days I have been sitting at home sick! It really sucks! I'm bored and I went to go to school and see my Megan! lol they just got busted...I'm watching Dawsons Creek. Oh yeah and I've been having some crazy dreams about Adam, Jared, and Josh.  I really don't like them!

AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-05 13:36:57 ----- BODY: Well I went back to school today! This is gonna have to be really short or really fast because I have ALOT Of homework to do and I have to go to church in about 2 and a 1/2 hours. Nothing to bad is going on. I'm just in a bad mood because people are just being really annoying lately.  Megan is getting to go back to Ninjutsu this weekend. I'm sort of happy sort of not. Its like Ninjutsu is my own little world. Away from all the childish people my age (no offense not all of them are immature). Having Megan there is like someone invading my world. Having Josh there is like invading my world too.  But Josh was there WAY before I was lol so I'm not even worrying about that.  I love Megan shes my best friend, but best friends also need some time apart. I don't have the heart to tell her the truth. Shes not like in LOVE with Ninjutsu like I am.  But I still think that it would hurt her feelings. I don't know what I'm gonna do about it especially since i kind of pressured her into joining. I'll figure something out or else I won't do anything at all about it.....homework time ! ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Moo DATE: 2003-11-05 13:41:11 Hey...

Like this weekend or something. Yeah... Because I'm a loser and have nothing to do. The parade was fun. Hehe.. Brandon. .:shakes head:. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-06 13:00:09 Yeah maybe this weekend....we should go see a movie on Saturday...wait no my mom has to work...hmm...and I have to help Josh move thats gay....we'll hang out next weekend. Or if you want you can come hang out my house Saturday. My mom works so either I will be all alone or Josh will be there. He wants me to help him move but I don't know I don't really want to. lol that was long Brandon thats not cool.  I still think about that when I look at him  ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Moo DATE: 2003-11-06 13:02:17 I know. It's like... his nose is a penis. Haha. Yeah. I'll talk to my mother. Call me and stuff. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-06 13:03:20 Lol alrighty. I'll either give you a call tonight or I'll call you tomorrow...what time is the latest you will be answering your phone tomorrow night?  ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Moo DATE: 2003-11-06 13:07:20 Um. 11. Should be good... Or later. It doesn't matter. I'll know it's you if you call at 1 in the morning. =D Hehe. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-07 07:54:58 hehe it won't be that late. I have Ninjutsu tonight and then I have Demo Team practice but I'm hoping to be home by 11! ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Moo DATE: 2003-11-07 12:30:33 That works. =D ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-06 11:00:16 ----- BODY: Well I got all my homework done last night! Whew it took me forever.Church was really boring. As usual. This chick that nobody likes thinks that shes my friend so she always comes and talks to me. Shes so annoying.  But I'm always nice to her anyways. It would be mean just to be go away I don't like you I can't do that.  I'm really mad at my mom. I hate having to listen to what she tells me. Shes the one who made me stop talking to the guy I'm in love with. I have to deal with pain from that everyday and its all her fault. It makes me hate her so bad. Sometimes I just want to try and run away again...it didn't work last time so it probably wouldn't work again so I'm not gonna risk it.  I'd have all the guy from Ninjutsu looking all over for me and when they found me they would tear my butt up.  So would Josh.  A well only a little bit more then 4 years in this house...hey I wonder if you can move out when your 17...I heard something about that. By then Josh should have the house....hmm....interesting.  I don't know I'll figure that out. Oh my gosh its really really really really really really really really really cold. My fingers are shaking. I'm gonna go under the covers.  ----- -------- TITLE: Good News AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-06 12:47:58 ----- BODY: I just got back from the Parent Teacher Conferences. They went extremely well all my teachers love me and gave my mom a good report.  I got all ones. Except in Language Arts cause Mr Costanzo is a dick. He also told my mom that I talk to much and me and brit need to be seperated. Well I'm gonna talk a lot no matter where I sit. I'M A TALKER!  DEAL!!!!  I'm still learning....obviously. Jeez oh well though.  Screw him. I thought he was cool at first cause hes a marine (I want to be one) and he likes the Sword of Truth Series (my fav book series). I even lent him a book. I guess hes still cool but he is also a dick....hmmm weird.  Oh yeah other good piece of information.  Tomie told some people that I was his kid on Tuesday. It was touching. I'm glad cause I pretty much think of him as my dad and I like knowing that he thinks of me as his daughter! Hes gonna be proud when he sees my report card YAY! I like making him happy! I get to go to work with him next Friday so no school for Cassie HAHAHA ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: shoot ashley DATE: 2003-11-06 14:12:21 its cassie!HOMEZ! ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-07 07:54:12 Yep its me!!

Yesterday Jared called me.  First he was like Kyle (his best friend) wants to talk to you. Kyle never really liked me so I knew I wasn't gonna like this but he got on the phone anyways. First it was just a little chit chat for about 30 seconds. Then he goes "So how many goes have you slept with this week?"  I said "That wasn't a very nice question" Then he said "Its an honest question"  Then I said "No its not" Then he said "Well didn't you cheat on Jared to fuck an 18 year old" I was like what the hell. I was mad. I didn't say anything. Thats when he realized he had made me mad which had been his point.  So he put Jared back on. Then Jared told me he didn't think we should talk anymore because his new g/f Emily does like that we talk. I didn't care at all because the only time I talked to him was when he called me, e-mailed me, or told me to call him.  So I was like thats retarded. So oh well about that. I just am really mad about what Kyle said. Josh came over after that happened. I told him about what happened. He just kind of gave me one of those looks like well...... when I told him what Kyle said.  Then when I told him about Jared he was like hes just being a dick trying to make you jealous and he said hes gonna make fun of him.  I was like wow thats great. But Josh made me feel better last night. We were laying on my couch in my room watching TV and talking the whole night. It was touching. Really it was.  Josh is great. Well thats all I have to say!  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-08 08:41:53 ----- BODY: First off Brit I can't come to your house tonight I'm really sorry.  I promise I'll make it up to you. Delanie sorry I didn't call last night I got back from Ninjutsu and was in pain and sweaty so I took a shower and laid down not knowing if I was ever gonna get back up! I can't hang out today cause Josh is coming to get me to put me to work in a little bit! We'll hang out like...next weekend or something!    Anyways....yesterday was fun. I went out to lunch with my mom. Not that interesting...pretty boring actually. Then we went and picked up Megan.  Megan and I went iceskating. That was cool.  I hurt my knee when I fell on purpose...I  didn't fall on accident at all it was cool. Then after that we got some TACO BELL! Then we came back to my house. We hung out until Josh came over to hang out and take us to class. When we got to class I tried to climb over the seat (I was in the back of the truck) and it was working until I fell! I fell out of the truck half way and had to use my hands so I didn't hit my head on the cement! Then Josh punched me in the ass which hurt!  Then I finally was able to get up and went to class. Class was pretty cool.  Megan got to work with Jason on combat techniques....I was jealous!  I worked with the little black 6th grader with corn rows. Hes pretty cool..but hes real cocky.  I had to put him in his place a lot of times.  Hes messing with me a purple belt and he doesn't even have a belt yet. But yeah thats ok.  Then we had Demo Team Practice. That was cool.  I got to stand by Jason the whole time...that doesn't sound to exciting but for me its awesome!  Our Demo isn't really done..we're just gonna wing it towards the end....thats really sad if you ask me.  But oh well...no one lets me have a say in anything anyways.  Like I tried to make a suggestion yesterday and right as I started to talk everyone started talking over me I was like what the hell. Oh well I'll get over it. After Demo Team practice we had to look for Josh's cell phone all over the place cause I had had it and then it like came out of my hoodie pocket or something and I had no idea wher it was. We spent about 15 minutes looking for it then I looked under the truck where I had fallen out and there it was! I got lucky lol!  Then after that I came home. Josh took me. His dad was drunk last night and had called him and they had kind of gotten in a fight or whatever. Then Josh left my house.  Next thing I know I got Ron (joshs dad) on the phone asking me if Josh is there. I tell him no but then hes like Cassie if hes there you better let me talk to him.  I'm like hes not here.  Then he goes on and on about if he drives over to my house and hes there blah blah blah then he was like well just plan on not seeing Josh for a while...I was like ok bye.  Then I called Josh and left him a message about it.  Then I called Jason. His phone died on me! It made me so mad! Then I laid done and waited to get tired!  Which didn't happen so I just laid there until this morning dozing in and out of sleep for maybe an hour or two. It was gay.  Now I'm just sitting here..doing nothing waiting for Josh to come get me! ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-10 08:35:23 ----- BODY: Well I'm in a really bad mood. The weekend was great....except Sunday.  I came home like 4 hours early from Tomies, skipped going to see the Matrix, to go home and clean the house and do laundry all day so that I could go over to Josh's for a cook-out. Well after I was almost done with my stuff Josh called and told me that they changed it to next weekend because they still needed to get stuff for the new house. I was really really really really really really really really mad...but I thought I could talk to Jason for a while and that would make it all better. That didn't happen. I called him but he was helping Jays mom move so he couldn't talk. Then I got on the computer.  It was 4:45 when I got on.  My hour, my sister had been on all day and I had gotten on when she had went upstairs for something. Then at 5 she came down like its my hour get off. I'm like you were on all day you can wait a little while longer. Then she got mad and was being a complete bitch about crap. It was really rude. I got off 5 MINUTES after 5. But when my mom got home she told her and then since I was in a bad mood I didn't really want to deal with it so I just was like whatever.  But yeah then my mom was like your grounded for the weekend.  Megan will be out of town so I really don't care, but now I don't get to go to Josh's cook out and I'll be stuck at home during my sisters birthday party. The only place I would have really wanted to go would be Josh's house where I could finally sleep.  Got to go learn!  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-10 18:10:11 ----- BODY: Dude everyone is fighting. Delanie and Kelli, Delanie and Ashley, and Delanie and Brit...sort of but not really the last one. Its crazy. I wish everyone could just get along and be one big old happy family.  I'm not in such as bad a mood as I was earlier.  I got to talk to Jason today. For like over an hour. It was great. He almost skipped school and came over to my house because I told him I was horny.  It was great.  I miss him! But thats ok.  I tried to talk to Josh, but he can't talk on his phone during the day cause it wastes his minutes and he was with his friends.  But oh well.  He told me to call him at 9 ish but I can't because I'm going to bed early. My mom is giving me some of her prescribed sleep medicine...its gonna knock me out so I can get a good night sleep.  Its gonna be good. Hopefully it will make me feel better. Because I certainly need that and so does my family. I'm being pretty bitchy....I fell bad but they keep throwing it in my face so I'm not gonna apologize. I'm sore from class yesterday but thats not unusual.  I need some water dude its not cool...crap I didn't do my homework oh screw it I will just copy Brits or someone elses. I'm to tired and lazy.  I'm excited for high school and I'm excited for Sterlings to start. I need something to distract me again!  Josh was doing a pretty good job of it but hes gonna get fired from that job in a minute...not like me breaking up with him but different. lol hmm....7th Heaven is almost over. That means its almost time for Cassie to go to bed.  Dude I'm really excited about High School.  I don't want me and Megan to go to different schools though.  Its sad. I'm gonna cry if we do. I'm gonna cry a lot. North sounds like a lot of fun but without Megan nothing will be the same! Shes like the only person I talk to. I'm trying to change that, but it seems to be a little bit to late.  Well 7th Heaven is over time for meds and sleep! PIMP!   ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Moo DATE: 2003-11-10 18:54:32 Hehe. =D I fight with people a lot. But hating Kelli just gives me a very warm feeling.    Me and Brit aren't fighting. =D She laughed at me when I posted.    And I don't even know about me and Ashes. We talk at school like we are best friends, but over here, we get into a lot of fights. =D ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-11 06:02:57 Yeah you do fight with people alot why is that?   Thats not good that hating someone gives you a warm feeling.     Ok I'm glad you and Brit aren't fighting.      Yeah it makes sense that you and Ashley don't get in fights here but get in fights outside of school. That has happened to me to!    ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Moo DATE: 2003-11-11 11:23:58 It's just Kelli. I hate her. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-11 13:33:52 Yeah I'm still really sorry about that one. I wish you guys got along.   ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Moo DATE: 2003-11-11 13:50:15 Don't wish we got along. I hate her and I like hating her.    If she wasn't a lying, back-stabbing, two-faced bitch, we'd still be friends.    It's her fault. I miss nothing. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-12 06:23:24 Alrighty then ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: shoot ashley DATE: 2003-11-12 13:30:38 seriously tho isnt that weird on the computer how its like a totaly different world? ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Moo DATE: 2003-11-12 13:40:32 Yes. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: shoot ashley DATE: 2003-11-12 13:47:21 ya i know ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-12 06:39:03 ----- BODY: Well yesterday wasn't a to bad day.  School was alright. Then I came home and started on my book report.  Then Josh came over while I working on it. So I didn't finish it.  Josh and I hung out for a while....mostly sleeping.  Then we ate dinner. Then we hung out and slept some more. Then his dad was gonna come pick us up for class. I was upstairs with Josh's phone and his dad called and told us to go outside. Then I went downstairs to get Josh but my phone was ringing. I picked it up and it was Channel 94.1 Jams. IT WAS THE HUNDRED DOLLA HOLLA THING!  It was awesome! I told them the phrase that pays and they told me I won! It was great. Then when they were getting the information from me Joshs dad was calling and bitching because he was having to wait. Then Josh told him that he was 7 minutes early and then he got really mad. So we had to hurry up and get out there. By that time Josh was in a bad mood, and I was still happy.  So then we got in the car and its wasn't Rons car it was Joshs uncles car. And his Ninjutsu stuff was in Rons car. So we had to drive all the way to council bluffs and get Joshs stuff.  on the way Ron and Martin gave us a "Life lesson".  Which pissed Josh off even more.  Then we got Joshs stuff and Josh drove to class...hes not supposed to be driving his truck cause he doesn't have tail lights right now. There was probably 10 words spoken the whole way there.  Josh just kind of sat there angry and I just was like....hmmm....I don't know what to say to someone so angry. So then we got to class and class went on and stuff. Then after class Sensei Marr wanted to talk to me.  He told me that I would be getting my purple striped in December because he knows I'm ready.  He also told me Karen will be getting her brown striped. That made me really mad. She doesn't deserve it. She still can't do the kicks you have to know at purple belt, the jumping spinning side and jumping spinning crescent.  If she gets black belt before me I will be so mad. But anyways after he told me that he went into a talk about drinking and the Martial Arts side of it.  After that talk he told me off the record that if I ever need anything or someone to talk to or anything like that to call him. I felt loved. I know this is not something that he says to all his students. I appreciated that. He is a truly awesome guy! Then Josh and I took off.  I talked ALOT on the way home but he was still mad and he didn't say much. When we got to my house. He just dropped me off. Which isn't what he usually does. Most of the time he comes in and hangs out. It was sad I didn't even get a kiss goodbye he was like see ya.  I'm like thats great. I didn't say anything I just got out and left.  I was kind of mad though.  I don't like it when Josh gets mad. It makes me sad. But he did forget that he was supposed to come in and get Matrix Reloaded back from me. Oh well thats his problem! Then last night I finally sleep! First time and 6 or 7 days!  It was great. But then I woke up and I was sick so now I'm at home....sick....sad sad.    ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-15 21:55:55 ----- BODY: Everythings going pretty good. Demo went fine. I'm getting my purple striped. Josh is still awesome!  Trinas party is going good. I'm babysitting. Totally tired. They were too so they are asleep and I would like to do the same~ Well later!  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-17 08:44:30 ----- BODY: Hmmmm way to much to write about write now. I'll just some up my weekend real quick.  Jason came over, mom found out cause of stupid ass sister, hes facing a restraining order and maybe jail time.  I told Josh about it and now hes mad at me. I think he thinks i was doing something with jason but I wasn't. He was just helping me babysit.  I would never do anything with anyone while i'm with Josh. I care about him way to much to do that.  I haven't gotten a chance to talk to Josh about it.  He didn't pick up his phone when I called and when I call tonight he will probably be at work.  its no fun.  I babysat Aden and Ryan. Everything went good except Ryan went POO POO in my bed.  It went through his diaper, through his pants, and on to my favorite blanket. It was crazy.  I spent way to much time with Alex.Shes driving me CRAZY!  Megan and I had a good time...it would have been better if it had just been me and her and no alex but oh well. Its to bad.  I'm tired really tired!  I was up really late on Saturday because I was thinking about Jason and arguing with my sister. I pretty much cried myself to sleep. It was sad. I just want to be friends with him.  What is so wrong with that? I don't get it. But oh well. There is nothing I can do about it.  I haven't talked to jason since that night.  I defended him and I started crying because it made me sad then he left. It was pretty gay of him but thats ok.  I don't know whats going to happen.  I know I hate my sister for doing that to me. But I don't think my mom is going to do anything at least I hope not.   ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: tonydatiger DATE: 2003-11-17 08:48:23 wow, ur life sux! is ur blanket better!lol! ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-18 08:39:20 Yeah I guess it does suck sometimes.

My mom hasn't done anything. Yet at least. Its a good thing. She told me she doesn't want him to have  a restraining order on his adult record!  So why doesn't she just not do it! Wow such a hard decision.  I still haven't talked to Josh. Its making me very mad and sad.  I keep trying to call him but he never answers the phone.  I leave him messages but he never calls me back. Hes supposed to be coming over for dinner tonight.  I hope he comes.  Even if he does break up with me.  I would rather him tell me then just keep not talking to me. And plus I would really like to tell him the rest of what happened since he hung up on me the minute he heard something he didn't like and didn't let me explain. Josh is very important to me and I don't want to lose him. As a boyfriend or a best friend! This is driving me crazy! I'm really worried about it but thats ok. I hope it gets better soon. I don't really have anything else to talk about. Oh Shawn from Science is really hot and nice.  He was flirting with me alot today....he was like holding my hand...that part was kind of weird.  People are being mean to Kelli. I know they have a problem with her but just leave the poor girl alone seriously ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-19 08:38:16 ----- BODY: Well I saw Josh last night.  Although he didn't come over for dinner. And he didn't call.  He drove to class and didn't call and ask me if I needed a ride. Very unusual.  Then at class he just ignored me and gave me a couple dirty looks.  I tried to call him after class and he didn't pick up so I left him a message. He never called me back. I think its over, I don't want it to be but I don't know what else to think.  I don't know what I should do....HELP!    ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Moo DATE: 2003-11-19 13:39:11 Ah!    You know what?

Delanie is switching schools that makes me sad.  I think I might cry.  Again! I was crying last night because Josh and I are pretty much over.  He still refuses to talk to me.  I wish he would. Then I could explain and apologize and pray that he would forgive me but no he won't even talk to me!  I have to stop writing cause I'm about to start crying and I'm at school so that ain't happening! ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-21 10:50:43 ----- BODY: Well I'm sitting at school, really bored. I got out of Spanish. I had to go up there for a little bit though. Even a little bit of time pissed me off oh well.  And now I'm sick. My head hurts, I'm freaking lightheaded, my throat is killing me, I keep coughing up a lung, and I'm freaking freezing.  Today has been a really bad day!  Except Mr Benak just made me laugh.  That was awesome lol.  That helps a little bit....hmmm....I'm bored though.  lalalala.  Josh and I are pretty much officially over. Thats not good.  I don't like that one bit dude. It kind of really sucks!  I'm gonna try and fix that though.   ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-22 05:57:51 ----- BODY: Well last night I called Josh and someone answered acting like a foreign fucker and saying there was no Josh there. They did that twice. I called Megan and she called him. They did the same thing to her but then Josh got on the phone and talked to her. Megan told Josh he needed to talk to me and he said he would call me that night. Well he never did. I called him after a while. He was either on the phone or wouldn't answer. Then Megan called him from her cell phone while I was on the other phone. I listened to what they were talking about. She asked him why he would answer for her and not me. He said he didn't want to talk to me now. Then Megan asked when he would want to talk to me, he said eventually.  He never told us how long eventually is.  It was crazy!  It made me really mad to.  He refuses to talk to me. I want Megan to ask him if its over or not so I can move on if it is and if its not I can get these bad thoughts out of my mind.  Well I still have the flu! It really sucks. I couldn't sleep like at all! It blew! Well I'm gonna go lay down.   ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Moo DATE: 2003-11-22 17:51:49 =\    I'm so sorry, Cassie. Don't worry.

I miss him. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-11-23 10:59:26 I think Brian will come around eventually. Hes a guy, they usually come crawling back.

I still have a cough and I'm still conjested but oh well.  Its better than it was.  I talked to Josh last night.   He hadn't been at class and I wanted to know why so I called him.  He was just like didn't you read your e-mail.  Because it turns out he had e-mail me and told me all about it so I didn't get worried. Touching!  Yeah! Then he was at his Aunts house and couldn't hear me so he told me to call him back in half an hour, but I never got ahold of him but thats ok cause I was watching shes all that and then I went to sleep.  Now I'm gonna go put BACK on my boxers and lay down so I can RELAx!  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2003-12-02 06:14:32 ----- BODY: Well now my eye hurts. Its all blood shot.

I'm in my 1st Hour class right now and we have a sub and nothing to do. Its pretty awesome.  Oh yeah Josh and I are doing much better.

I spent like 5 hours with him.  Then I called him and talked to him for like 2 hours.  It was awesome.  It never got boring.  It was cool.  My feelings for him are getting stronger and my feelings for Jason are started to fade. I'm beginning to realize that I have to try and get over him even though I still love him its crazy!  There is a concert at Sokol the 20th from 12 to 12 and I'm going. Venaculas is gonna be there.  I'm really excited but thats ok.  I have to get going though.

I'm just sitting here in 4th Hour Web Design. So boring! Usually I can talk to Brit but no!  Not today!  Shes sitting over by Hannah.  How sad! I feel unloved.  Dude the concert is tomorrow. It should be pretty good.  I still wish I wasn't in trouble and in a way I wish it was just me and Megan and Sarah going. But I'm still glad other people are going to. But I don't know its really confusing.  I got to see my brother last night and talk to Robbie.  Glen came over to help me build me bridge.  He didn't really do much except blah blah bell just rang g2g ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-01-05 08:50:05 ----- BODY: Well heres what has happened lately!  I got the Student of the Year Award from Ninjutsu. It's the award where the Chief Instructor picks his best student or who he thinks is an awesome student anyways, and I got it!  I was so surprised.  It was so great to!  I wanted to get that award last year but I didn't and I didn't expect it at all this year. Now I have a really cool plaque to hang up.  Then the concert came!  It was really fun.   There was a bunch of people there!  All the people that I knew that were there was Brit, Delanie, Quincee, Megan, Brian, Nick, Jason, me, Jake, and Alex.   Alex was really boring the whole time.  But thats the usual for her.  Delanie and Brian didn't get along so that sucked. I felt bad but we didn't know Brian was gonna be there. Nick was awesome.  Him and Megan started going out.  ALEX WAS FLIRTING WITH BRIAN!  We almost had to stupid smack her. She got lucky that we didn't.  Megan, Brit, and I did a whole bunch of mosh pitting it was really fun and painful lol.  Then we went downstairs and Brian and Jason jumped on a couch and got kicked out.  So we all left. Everyone except Jason came back to my house.  Alex was the first to leave.  Thank god!   Brian and Nick had to leave before my mom got home to. Then Megan left a little later also. Then Brit, Delanie, and Quincee stayed the night at my house. It was fun. We ate a whole bunch of food.  Quincee and I talked until like 5 in the flipping morning.  Then I got up and went to Tomies the next day. It was crazy and I was horribly tired and horribly sore! But oh well it was worth it. Then Jasmine, Nicole, and Megan came over and spent the night for my birthday. MEGAN GOT MY SUPERMAN PAJAMAS THEY ARE AWESOME!  We went egging. We were gonna TP bu we decided not to.  I was the only one who through any eggs.  But oh well. Megan didn't even go she stayed and talked to Josh. Then we took some Motrin. I took like 6 of them.  It was crazy. Then Megan and Josh were flipping out cause they thought I was going to die and kept trying to make me throw up. But I didn't. The next day Megan and I went to the mall and to a movie.  That was fun to.  Then the next day was my birthday! I turned 14 go me.  My brothers and my sister came over. My brothers brought their girlfriend though. But oh well.  It was still cool. Then Josh and his cousin came over and we hung out. It was a good birthday!  I was kind of pissed because Glen was late but once he got there I was in a great mood cause I love my brother. MOMMA THIS IS A LAMP AND THIS IS HOW YOU TURN IT ON! lol thats a quote from How High we watched that on my b-day to.  I spent alot of time with Josh on New Years Eve Eve and New Years Eve.  It was fun. He came over to Megans on New Years Eve. We played Monopoly, Sorry, Uno, and hung out. We also had a  contest to see who could spin in circle the longest and I won!  Hehe.  Then Josh went to Arkansas I was sad.  Nothing else really happened that was to important other than Jason and I are kind of engaged but without the restrictions you know. Like I still have Josh and yeah.  Its cool but I think I like Josh better than Jason its crazy! But oh well!  Gotta get to work!  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-01-06 08:19:52 ----- BODY: Last night I had a crazy dream.  Jason came to my house drunk and Josh and Megan were there.  He started talking about mine and his relationship and I lost Josh forever because of Jason. So now I think I will be talking Jason soon because I really really really don't want to lose Josh at all.  That would be sad.  Dude I'm trying to listen to Trapt but people are being way to loud I'll kill them!  lol jk.  Brit, Megan, and I are gonna hang out on Saturday. That should be fun you know!  Well got to go look at movie times! ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-01-07 08:33:50 ----- BODY: Well I'm in a good/bad mood.  Today I got to sleep in for a little bit because I felt like it. It was cool!  Last night Josh helped me with the bridge for a really long time. And Megan came and worked on it to.  We're still not done and the bridge is really pissing me off!  Josh is so awesome I got tired and I laid down and he kept working on the bridge he came up with a much easier way to build it, I'm not sure how much it will hold but I hope it will be alot otherwise I might cry!  Josh is so awesome its  not even funny!  Hes the greatest, most of the time anyways.  While I was laying down the phone would ring and he would ask me if it was my phone and then he would answer it for me.   Then he worked on the bridge and then his dad was on his way so he came and laid down with me.  We had some of those amazingly passionate kisses and then we just layed there staring into each others eyes.  It was so cool.  Then his dad called and said he was here so he had to leave.  He got out of bed and gave me a kiss and then said "Damn it" under his breathe. I was like what and he said nothing. Then I was like what tell me and he was like I don't want to leave and then I was like I don't want you to leave.  It was great. But he had to leave. Otherwise his dad would get pissed, he really needs to get a new car but thats ok.  Well things with Jason are going crazy. I'm writing him a letter telling him about how I can't be anything more than friends with him until I'm ready.  And yeah. I hope he understands. I'm afraid its gonna hurt his feelings though but its either his feelings or Joshs and if I hurt Joshs I would get hurt pretty bad to.  I'm really glad I had that dream otherwise I would never have gotten the nerve to tell him that. But yeah I have to go and do some work.   ----- -------- TITLE: Ranting and Raving that I really needed to say....... AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-01-08 06:35:33 ----- BODY: Well I talked to Jason last night. I really pissed him off. He actually cried because he was worried he was gonna lose me and he also beat the crap out his steering wheel.  It was kind of crazy.  He also did a lot of ranting and raving in the form of yelling. It was so loud I would take the phone away from my ear and Megan could hear everything he was saying except you know the parts where when someones yelling you have NO IDEA what they are saying.  It was scary.  I don't like it when people yell at me, it makes me think they are gonna get violent lol. And I don't like violeve.  But yeah I don't know whats going on now. I think he gets it but he also doesn't.  He was trying to argue his point across but it wasn't working cause my mind is made up.  Last night Megan stayed the night to work on the bridge. It was really hard. And we didn't get that much done not much at all.  We fell asleep at like 2 or 3 and then woke up at 6 so I'm super dooper tired. But oh well I guess I will just have to get over it. I don't know if we will be able to finish building the bridge by Friday because we have a lot of work to do and Friday is tomorrow but if we don't I will cry but I will be ok.  If we're not gonna be able to finish our bridge I will finish the one we originally were gonna use but decided it wasn't going to work. So yeah we started over and this one will  work way better.  yeah well my hand hurts so I will stop typing.  Wow that was helpful I'm not as cranky anymore.....crazy!  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-01-13 05:53:21 ----- BODY: Well everything is going pretty good. Especially with Josh. Hes so awesome!  Hes having a party tonight or Friday and I'm probably gonna go. It should be pretty fun especially if it goes down on Friday cause then Megan will be there, thats always good!  I'm in school right now. I'm in a really good mood to, even though I'm gonna have SAAC tomorrow but thats ok.  Not my problem!  Its my moms and administrators lol.  But thats ok.  Do do dodo.  Josh is awesome though.  I had a concussion the other night and he wouldn't let me fall asleep cause he didn't want me to like die or anything lol.  He was worried and thats when I realized he cares about me and when I would leave the room he was in with his friends because they were pissing me off he would come out there and talk to me instead of them. And when he had to go talk to them he was all like I'll be right back and gave me a kiss it was so touching.  God I sound like one of those girlie girls but oh well.  I'm happy and thats all that matters!  Well I'm not sure about the Jason thing. Hes getting an apartment soon. That should be cool, but I still don't know if we'll end up together or not. Josh seems to be changing my future, but hes never gonna know that.  ----- -------- TITLE: Almost Time to Party AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-01-14 08:50:42 ----- BODY: Well Josh is having his party Friday obviously!  I'm so excited. There gonna have a keg and Josh is planning on getting me drunk for the first time. It sounds like fun to me.  Probably there will be some smoking going down to. Megan thinks something bad is gonna happen to me cause I'll be drinking around a bunch of 17 or 18 year old guys but she probably will be to. And Josh will be there.  And some of our other friends.  It won't be bad. Josh won't let anything happen to us. I know him!   It exciting though. I'm also kind of nervous cause Megan and I won't know anyone except each other, Josh and Dusty.  And a couple of Joshs friends that we just meet but they don't count cause we haven't really talked to them cause they were jerks. I really wanted Joshs younger sister Kelsey to go but shes only 12 and yeah I don't know thats just bad and she lives really far away and no one will drive her down her. She has a friend that lives not to far away I think her and her friend should walk over or something like that.  Kelsey is awesome lol. Don't ask me why. But yeah!  Its gonna be a HELL OF A TIME climbing back in my window after getting drunk off my ass dude seriously.  Its gonna be very difficult.  But oh well. Its totally worth it. Plus the worst that could happen would be me falling in.  Haha that would be pretty funny but then my mom would probably hear it and that would be really bad and I could get hurt but its gonna be fun either way!  I'M SO EXCITED I JUST CAN'T HIDE IT! Oh yeah and Megan and I should be getting our money back from Dusty this weekend or I'll have to kick his ass you know?  He'll deserve it! But he'd probably end up kicking my ass oh well.  Its all good!  Hmm.....I think I should get going and check my e-mail one more time and then go to Geometry! TWO MORE DAYS AND LIKE 12 HOURS OR SOMETHING HEHE 60 hours haha ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-08 16:22:35 ----- BODY: Wow its been a really long time since I've been on here. How sad!  Josh had his party.  Some crazy stuff happened. We didn't go though. He had people passed out all over his house the next day hehe.  Everything is going ok. My family is a bunch of losers but what else is new. Josh and I are kind of on the rocks but I'm praying that everything will work itself out.  Megan is wonderful as always. Her b-day is tomorrow.   HAPPY B-DAY MEGAN!  Hehe. Ummm...I don't really have much to say. I need a job!  Really bad because I need a cell phone. Or really I want one really bad and I want a job really bad so I can pay for stuff and won't have to spend so much time at home but I don't want it to get in the way of ninjutsu oh well if it does I don't know what I'll do but I'll have to deal somehow.   ----- -------- TITLE: It didn't work itself out AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-19 14:00:48 ----- BODY: Well now I'm sitting here in tears cause I have pretty much lost my boyfriend and my 2nd best friend.  Josh has been cheating on me.  I thought something was up so I asked someone to watch him for me.  Then I found out that he got a hand job from a crackwhore in a parking lot and that he was grabbing all over drunk chicks at his party.  For that I wanted to punch him in the face but I never got the chance. And I know theres more than that that the person didn't tell me cause they didn't want me to get hurt any more. Well to late.  Today that same person told me that Josh had been talking and probably more to his ex-girlfriend Marlene. The girl hes fucked like a zillion times and that he loved.  He told me that he stopped talking to her. And obviously he hasn't.  We all know that when you start talking to someone that you used to love you start getting those feelings back.  When that shit happens people get left in the dirt. Today that person is me. I know Josh is gonna leave me in the dirt even though hes my best friend I know he would do that to me. I mean this chick isn't like horrible pretty and I've heard shes a really big bitch to, but hell hes a guy he would diss me for a girl he can actually fuck anytime he wants to.  I'm madder than shit right now. I've been sitting in my room crying.  Then I went upstairs and I saw a picture of Josh and I from back when we were happy at homecoming. Now I have all these amazing memories flooding over me.  And now I can't stop crying so I'm gonna stop writing. Oh yeah I really really really really want to break Joshs fucking nose or kick him harder than fuck in the balls.   ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: UCantRapeTheWilling DATE: 2004-02-19 14:08:33 Cassie just remember that your wife is here for you. love ya. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-19 14:46:18 Thanks Brit I feel so loved.  ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: UCantRapeTheWilling DATE: 2004-02-19 15:22:41 You should. because you are very loved.

I don't need anymore advice.  I know everything your saying but it doesn't make a difference. Josh fucking hurting me the least i can do is do something back to him. I don't care if he doesn't care about and if he doesn't good thats better.  But I will feel better if someone gives him a piece of their minds before I give him mine because mines more likely to be a piece of  my fist.  ----- -------- TITLE: Just Great AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-20 20:51:11 ----- BODY: Well I just got back from Ninjutsu and Demo Team.  I'm extremely pissed off.  First I was trying to be cool to Josh not being rude or anything because whenever I see him or hear him I smile and am no longer mad at him for that little of a time.  But then Josh made me even more mad.  He gave me dirty look like what the hell is your problem? Even though I didn't do anything. He also completely ignored me like I'm one who did something here.  If he thinks I did something he should talk to me, but I can't talk because I haven't talked to him. Me I'm scared. I'm scared of actually hearing that hes not mine anymore, I know its coming but I just can't believe it.  A long time ago I saw a picture of Marlene, his ex, in one of his drawers cause I was arranging them. I was like whats this. And hes like a picture of Marlene, then I asked him why he had it. And he said I don't know just because.  I didn't really think much of it I thought no big deal. But now I think that it is a big deal. If I had a pic of my ex which I do it wouldn't be that big of a deal because I have pics of everyone. But Josh he doesn't have pics of anyone at all.  So now that I think about it I should have noticed something right then and there cause I could have prevented this from happening to me. Now I'm sitting here thinking.  I should have known that I could never live up to Marlene.  She was going out with him from the day I met him until a couple weeks before I started dated him.  I should have known that I was going to be in her shadows. I should have known he was going to end up back with her.  Thats what people tell me they always did. They would break up and then get back together all the time.  Now I think thats what is happening. You know this time I had been absolutely sure that I WOULD NOT get burned. But I am getting burned. I decided hey I'll just have fun and won't put any serious feeling behind this.  Then a week before this shit happened I decided to finally admit to myself and Megan that I did love Josh.  I wasn't going to admit it to him because I wasn't ready for that.  But now I regret that we're gonna end before I even have a chance to tell him that. I want him to know what he means to me. I told Jason that I couldn't talk to him as much and we could be STRICTLY friends because I cared about Josh far to much. I had to listen to Jason whine and complain about that for at least an hour. Ask Megan he was like SCREAMING in my ear.  Then I had to deal with him being pissy with me for a long time. Then we become friends and we're tight again.  Now everything that I ever thought is gone. I packed up the pictures of Josh and I and buried them.  I couldn't get rid of the memories because every place in my house has memories. The kitchen table where he THE FIRST GUY EVER that I dated to sit at my kitchen table and eat dinner with me and my family. He was always invited my family LOVES HIM! Most of the time I pick the guys no one likes. But this one everyone liked.  Even my brother and Tomie thought he was ok WHICH I never thought could happen.  One of my brothers is actually extremely close with Josh and loves him like a brother. He also had an in with my friend.  Megan liked him. We all shared lots of good times together. Nicole liked him and most of my other friends did to, unless he was drunk or high...which probably won't be a problem anymore anyways.  But I don't know everything is crazy and messed up and not AT ALL what I want it to be.  It sucks balls dude.  Then today I had to be around Josh for 3 or 4 hours without being able to say a damn thing about how I'm feeling right now I was having a lot of trouble with that. I don't want to lose Josh but I think I already have. You know he never checks his e-mail but I'm gonna send him this post just in case he does, but I don't know if I want him to.   ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-24 15:21:56 ----- BODY: Well now its official. Its over and he did play me. He went to parties and fucked other chicks. He told me he would NEVER cheat on me. He lied. The next time I see him I'm gonna hit him.  If thats tonight I won't but any other time outside of class hes getting it.  I'm madder than fuck right now and I can't calm down so I think I'm gonna go hit a wall.   ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Domo Arigato DATE: 2004-02-24 15:56:41 Just remember to stick what you think right now. He will probably act like its no big deal and he can change or something and ask to go on. Don't give in. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-24 20:33:51 Alright thanks ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-24 16:14:42 ----- BODY: Ok now I think its time for me to vent.  Well I'm pissed off....obviously.  In 6th hour today I just sat there crying silently cause I kept thinking about some of our memories. The way we used to hate having leave each other. The way if we were having a really good time we would kiss passionately (more than usual) for as long as we could. Like on my b-day.  He told Dusty to wait in the car for him and he kept wishing me a happy b-day and smiling and kissing me.  His eyes are so pretty I just get lost in them.  Everything always fit perfect with Josh. Nothing seemed wrong. Everything was great. It felt like I could stay with him forever. We were together for almost 6 months but it only felt like it was a week.  But when we fought the 2 times we did it felt like it was a century.  Time went by a lot slower.   I loved it when Josh would leave school early to pick me up from school or to just come and hang out if I was at home.  We spent so much time together it was just natural for him to be at my house.  It felt right. He was like part of the family.  He was better than family.  I wish I could have lived with him and he told me he felt the same way.  I guess that wasn't the truth or that he would rather just go around sleeping with girls rather than having a deep meaningful relationship with one. Maybe I should do the same thing. Maybe I should just sleep with a bunch of guys and that be it. No thats not me.  Josh was the greatest guy I had ever meet.  He always made sure I was happy. When we were hanging out with some of his friends at his house one day he had just been hanging out with his friends and Megan and I decided to go over there.  But we got there and no one really introduced us to his friends, they don't do that their weird.  And once I did meet his friends I didn't like them.  So I left the room Josh and his friends were in.  As soon as I did Josh came out and gave me a hug and a kiss and ask me what was wrong.  I was like nothing your friends just are being annoying cause I'm younger. Then he was like there just messing with you and I was like well I don't like it. So him and I sat there together and left his friends in the other room until they left.  Then later that night I got a concussion and he was really worried about me. He wouldn't let me go to sleep.  He was all like "You have to stay awake don't go to sleep."  He sounded so serious and caring which is a side of Josh that most people don't get to see.  I had to stay awake for him.  Then one night Megan, Josh, and I were working on our Geometry bridge.  Then Megan left and I was getting super frustrated and tired so Josh told me to lay down and he would work on it. Then he did.  He worked on it until his dad called and said he was almost there and by that time I was almost asleep. So he climbed into my bed next to me and had me roll over and then he kissed me.  Then we just stared into each others eyes until he had to leave. It was the most touching moment of my life.  Then when his dad called and said he was outside Josh was like damn and I said what and he told me he didn't want to leave me.  I have way more good memories then I do bad.  He was amazing.  At homecoming I felt like shit cause I had just started my period and was having a really bad day.  But he understood and stood by me the whole time. We didn't dance we just walked around.  Every night I dream about our good memories and memories that could've happened if we didn't break up and then I dream about making up with him.  I wish that stuff would happen.  Now it hurts so bad to know I'm not with him and he doesn't want to be with me. I feel like I wasn't good enough for him.  I feel like I did something wrong.  All I did was love him and care about him.  I still do. I don't know if that will ever change.  I know I'll get over him someday but I don't know if I can ever stop loving him. I'm worried about him though.  He never acted like a jerk until he started partying way to much and I'm sure thats when he started to cheat on me.  I blame his cousin Dusty and his step dad.  Dusty cause he brought it into Joshs life. His step dad he died. He was the only one who Josh listened to. Now the one who Josh listens to is Mr. Marr but I don't think he knows what to do about this.  They think that hes not one whos high ALL the time. But he is. When Mr. Marr talked to Josh about his smoking he was high, high as a mother fucker.  Oh yeah and Josh knows that I told Mr. Marr...even though it wasn't really me.  But I don't care. Someday he'll thank me if he changes his life around like he needs to.  Time to go to class. More later probably ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: gripewater DATE: 2004-02-25 09:51:52 "I blame his cousin Dusty and his step dad?"    Sweety, don't make excuses for him.  Blame him.  He is in charge of his penis and where he puts it.      Millions of men, everyday...face temptation and cave, if they do- they only have themselves to blame.    How he cheated or with whom he cheated, well, the details don't matter- just don't be one of those girls who makes excuses for your man cheating on you.  He did it, he is responsible for it and he could only HOPE you would make it easier for him by helping him place blame somewhere else.    Tell me this, what if he brought home to you some sort of disease and gave it to you... would you blame the person HE got it from?    He is a cheater.    Fool you once, blame on him.  Fool you twice, blame on YOU. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-25 15:44:24 I didn't mean him cheating. Thats all his fault. I meant the fact hes been getting into drugs. Thats his fault to but his cousin, stepdad, and real dad haven't helped out in the slightest bit. They make it so easy for him to do this stuff. I know its all the guys fault when they cheat hell no. A guy cheats on me he gets a slap in the face and a "Stay the fuck away from me". I don't deal with that shit.  ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: gripewater DATE: 2004-02-25 16:29:54 Good for you, although I don't condone the violence.... :) ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-25 19:08:36 lol yeah.  I still haven't gotten the chance to smack him though.  Maybe Friday if I'm lucky. He always is with his dad or Sensei Doss..there is no way I'm hitting him with either of those guys around.  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-24 20:38:17 ----- BODY: Wow that last post was long.  Well I went to class. Everything was good until Josh walked in.  As soon as he was in the black belt room I turned to Lucas and was like hes here now I'm leaving and I put on my jacket and shoes and was ready to go but Lucas wouldn't let me walk him. I needed to. I wanted to blow off some steam.  But no. So he was gonna take me home. It was 5 minutes til class started and I was like you'll be late don't worry about me.  Then he was like no I'm taking you. So I said fine whatever I'm not gonna let his dumb ass control my life I'm staying. And I stayed.  I did alot of clenching my teeth and putting my hands in fists but holding back. I couldn't hit him. Not then anyways. Then when he was leaving he went out alone. So I hurried up and got ready to go and asked Lucas for the keys he hestitated but then he gave them to me.  That hesitation cost me my chance. That was the point.  I wanted to hit him so bad and so hard. He needs the sense knocked into him but he was gone by the time I got down there.  I might get another chance but his dad will probably be there so that will fuck it all up.  Now I'm shaking cause I'm so angry and sad all at once. I thought Josh was gonna be my "High School Sweetheart" all through High School. Now thats screwed.  Well I'm gonna go make a call.   ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-25 19:12:30 ----- BODY: Well its going a little better. I'm still upset of course but its better. Jared and I are closer than we have ever been before.   ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-26 13:23:05 ----- BODY: Well today wasn't so great. Brian is pissed off at me cause of something I did, but he took it the wrong way completely.  Now hes mad at me and I don't like it when anyone is mad at me so that sucks. I caught myself thinking of Josh. Which is kind of hard not to since a lot of things Megan and I say come from him and other people say it now to say I'll hear something that reminds me of him all the time. Like that weird sound Megan and I make. Or the nice warm cup of shut the hell up.  Or talking about the munchies cause he always got really bad munchies.  Or cracka cause thats what I always called him. Its crazy. Everything reminds me of him and it bothers me. I was walking home yesterday and I was on Center which is a really busy street. I decided to walk through an alley instead cause I didn't want like his dad or one of his friends to see me and stop and say something. Or even worse him. I would have to hit him. His dad is so awesome and it sucks cause now I feel weird around him and now I can't make him have a barbecue and make his awesome steaks or have him make me chili. No fun. I bet Josh said the same thing about my mom cause she always gave him free food. Cookies, brownies, banana bread, and any food we had for dinner he could come and eat it with us. My mom always told Josh he couldn't break up with me cause he'd miss her and her food to much. It was funny then but now its just weird. My mom and sisters always ask me how my love life is going so that also makes me think about Josh. And I always tell them that I don't want to talk about it.  One other really sucky thing. I think I have a crush on Jesse Quance, Megans ex. We hang out with him yesterday after wrestling hes super awesome and always smells AMAZING! I always like guys who smell really good. I'm obsessed. Thats the first thing I do is smell them and look at their eyes then comes the muscles lol. But yeah.  I don't know Jesses has a great smell nice eyes and some good muscles. Its crazy.  But yeah I don't want to have a crush on him cause 1. He goes to my school ewww 2. Hes Megans ex 3. I know other people who like him and I don't want any of that shit going off on me. No no no I don't!  But who knows. Nothing is probably gonna happen cause I would never ask him out or any other guy so yeah. It don't matter!

He keeps getting the way so I can't see and moving my arm so I mess up what I'm doing. He should be asleep not sitting on me having a party. Well tonight I found out that adults have the same kind of drama in their lifes as we do. They have no reason to say stuff like "Teenagers and their dramas." They have it to. But thats beside the point. I'm having a lot of fun with my nephews. The other one is asleep though. Its sad. lol.  Umm well today i had to work with Josh on throwing. Meaning I got to throw him around.  Having him that close to me.  It just sucked. I know I can't have him yet hes right there. Why can't I just reach out and hug him like I used to? Why did everything have to change between us? It was going great. Why did he have to ruin it? I feel like I lost part of myself. Its no fun. When his hand touched mine for a second I felt fulfilled. I felt like that part of me had returned.  I know I don't need him but I want him back so bad.  If anyone knows how I can get him back please tell me.  No one start telling me how hes a jerk and shit I don't want to hear it.  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-02-28 12:46:58 ----- BODY: Today I saw Josh again. It was highly unexpected.  I didn't want to have to see him that day. But I did. I miss him so much.  Through out the whole class I spent half the time watching Megan doing what she was doing but the other half was spent thinking about Josh and watching him.  I want to ask him his reasons for wanting our relationship to end.  I know mine, but I don't know his. I just don't know how or when to figure that stuff out.  I want to call him and be like "I want to talk to you" but I don't want him to make me even more mad by saying I don't have time or I have no way of getting to where you are or something. I don't know if hes nice enough to give me the time of day.  I also get very nervous when I call his house. It makes seem like I'm begging for him back when in reality I would never beg for him back. I want my money back from his cousin and I want to hear his reasons for cheating on me and the other one I already said.  And I want to talk to him about his drug and alcohol problem.  I don't know if this is going to happen though.  If it did I would want Megan to be there but even if its not her conversation she has to put her two cents in and that bugs me so bad.  But I still love her of course. Shes Megan. Maybe I can get Alex or someone to ask him if he'll talk to me.

It went super awesome. YAY FOR CASSIE!  Then we messed around for a while after we got there. Then we practiced the demo. Then we had one show. Then we ate cookies lol and then we had our second show. The first show didn't go to hot.  Sensei Doss got it all messed up but the 2nd show was awesome. I was picked to do a board break. I like ridge hands and I've broken these kinds of boards with a ridgehand before so I decided to do that.  Then they picked a board with a giant knot in it (it makes it very difficult to break). So I nearly broke my right hand hitting it as hard as I possibly could and I still didn't break it. Then Tomie got the same board but he got to do a Jumping Front Kick which is a really powerful kick. He couldn't break it the first time but then the 2nd time he had to put a whole lot of effort into it. My hand is swollen now and it hurts to type but oh well. I tried to call my wife before the demo to see if she could come watch me cause we were out by her house but I either didn't get the number right or something. I would have broken the board if my wife had been there. I would have had to show off for her lol. But yeah. Josh and I are sort of getting to be friends again. I called him a little bit ago but I knew he wouldn't be home yet but I left a message for him to call me. I want to talk to him and ask him those questions. But it has to be in person. Alex told him I wanted to talk to him in person and he said he would get a hold of me but hes to slow so I think I might just get ahold of him. I have SAAC the next 3 days.  Isn't that just great?  I'll be having a grand old time. DUDE! Go out and spin in circles in the rain it is so much fun.  I was doing that and then Megan and I were jumping in big piles of snow! Its the coolest feeling ever.  Oh yeah this Thursday is Parent/Teacher Conferences. Thats going to suck. Cassie is going to be in a shit load of trouble the next couple months lol hopefully just days. I have testing on Friday YAY and a whole crap load of demos coming up.

I was in SAAC all day and will be for the next two days.It sucks.  It's so quiet I just start thinking about stuff.  Mainly Josh.  God I miss him really bad right now.  I missed him really bad last night. I talked to him on the phone and he said something about something but part of what he said was "when we went out." Hearing him say WHEN in the past tense god it just sounds so wrong. I was reading my other journal (the written kind) last night. I read part of it that was talking about the day Josh moved and I was helping him and his dad.  Then after like 8 hours of working we were all hanging out and stuff. Then Ron (his dad) out of no where told Josh not to lose me and keep me. Then Josh said oh don't worry I won't. I felt so loved. But he did lose me. Its so sad. Then  one  night we were hanging out in Joshs truck (Just Josh and me) and we were talking about stuff and I said something about how Jason wanted me to move in with him when hes 18 and Josh was like oh hell no your moving in with me I'll have my dads house by then and I was like but what if we're not going out then and he was oh we will be and he gave me one of his damn sexy smiles. God I miss those moments. Its so sad. I still want to know what went wrong.  I know what went wrong for me, the drinking, smoking, partying, and as I thought at the time the cheating. But now thats more in his past and the cheating never happened.  Now I went to know what could have been going so bad for him in his life that he started partying like that? What made him want our relationship to end? When I was talking to him I knew I had three questions to ask him but I only remembered two until we got off the phone I was pissed off. But oh well. Why do I need to know?  Its over.  Forever. Wow.  I don't like the sound of that. Not one bit. Oh my.  Today is getting worse and worse.  When I came down here and turned on my music my mom came down and she was like are you ok and I was like yeah. Then she was like ok we're leaving at 3:30 to see Passion of the Christ.  But I told her I really didn't want to go cause I don't like bloody movies at all (they give me nightmares) and I need to work on stuff for testing. But she kept kissing my head until I would say I would go. I never did but I have to. But I really really really don't want to. I don't like my family and I'm in a bad mood and I don't like watching movies when I'm in a bad mood. But this is getting way to long.    ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-03-04 09:43:03 ----- BODY: Well this is crappy. Tomorrow is testing and even if I get my belt I won't be able to enjoy it. My mom just told me I can't go for a week after testing.  Thats bullshit. Some how she found out that I smoke and that I cut class.  She was like I'm worried about you. I'm like oh great. If you wanted to be worried the time was a week ago not today. Cutting class and smoking...Ninjutsu is the reason I have only cut class once and smoked a dozen times or so.  Ninjutsu is the one thing keeping me from going crazy. My life is a shit hole right now. My mom is a bitch who only cares about work, school, and Roger.  My sister fucking hates me and is the most annoying person I have ever meet in my life. Josh and I are broken up and thats been harder than I ever thought it would be on me.  School sucks. I'm failiing geometry and probably some other classes to.  I just got out of SAAC and now I'm in trouble at home. I've been flipping out about testing tomorrow for like a month.  People at school are pissing me off. Megan is pissing me off. She keeps treating me like a pile of shit. Then she blames me. I don't know how that works. Jake, Nash, Kate, and Crystal can't make it to my testing. Well maybe Jake but its just not the same.  Now shes taking the one thing away from me thats been going good. Thats the dumbest thing I have ever heard of in my whole life. I'm going to go smoke a cig cause she pissed me off.   ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: UCantRapeTheWilling DATE: 2004-03-04 12:30:55 Cassie, I love you! I will be at your testing so yeah. Don't worry. I think you should talk to your mom about how she doesn't seem to care about you as much as she use to or whatever.     BRiT (your wife) ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-03-04 14:15:33 I already tried that. She got really pissed off at me and gave me dirty looks for like a week. I didn't even say it rudely or anything. She just flipped. She blames us. She says I do all this work so I can buy you guys the stuff you need and blah blah blah just cause I can't remember everything its not my fault I have to deal with meetings with the senator and school and blah blah blah. Its annoying  ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: UCantRapeTheWilling DATE: 2004-03-04 15:25:36 Well write her a note. Be like please don't blow up. and blah blah blah. I promise that will work. But you need to call me I need to talk to you about some shit. Alrite buhbye  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-03-05 22:09:31 ----- BODY: Well today went pretty good. Brit came over in the morning. Megan was already here.  Then we got up. Ate some breakfast.  (don't say anything Brit).  Then we just hang out. After a while we went to the gas station. Then we got a WHOLE bunch of junkfood. That was our lunch. Then we watched Wrong Turn. After that Lucas came over. We started training. Then my Jason came over. Then we trained some more.  Then Megan and Brit made Lucas some spaghetti. Then we went to testing. Quincee, Delanie, and my brother all came. I was so excited to have them all there. Then I got my ass kicked at testing. It was so much fun though. I don't know how well I did. Brit what do you think?  Then after testing Jay, Sasha, Meg, Lucas, Charlie, and I went to Village Inn to eat and celebrate. It was fun. Now I'm home. Exciting day right. Well something bad happened in there to.  Josh had done some pretty cool things during testing (to advance to his 2nd Degree Black). So afterwards I was walking by him and told him he did really good. Then he patted me on the back and told me how good I did to and then he grabbed my shoulder muscle things, whatever there called, and squeezed them. I always did that to him on his side and he always did it to me on my shoulders. I almost started crying.  I had been walking out of the room so I kept going. Then muriel, quincee, and Brit were out there. So I leaned on Quincee as if I was tired but I was just trying not to fall over and start crying.  I miss him so much. Theres just something about Josh that just makes me want him so bad. Its like hes a drug and I feel like I need the drug but I know I really just want it so bad cause I'm used to getting it.  Wow that was deep and sad. Well other good news. Jake is coming in tomorrow! I'm so excited. I miss my Jake so much.  I never get to see him and now I do.  Its awesome. Time to shower and sleep! Wish me luck at my demo tomorrow and that I get my brown belt tomorrow to.    ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: Moo DATE: 2004-03-05 22:10:29 Um. I didn't go?

Joshua might come and hang out with me today. If his dad comes home soon he will I think. I'm excited. That should be fun. He might get to read my journal.

TOday was the first time I actually sat and listened to him. Hes telling me how I broke his heart and did him dirtball. Now hes making me feel bad. How the hell am I letting that happen?  Thats cause I'm a chicken shit when it comes to guys. If the guy hurts me I keep it to myself. As if I have a tough girl reputation to keep up.  Wow he just called me a coldhearted person, again. I'm really sick and tired of this. I think I'm going to invite him over on a day other people are here.  He just asked if I want to see him.  Yep I do see him get beat up.  Hes coming over Sat. at like 12 so if there is anyone whos reading this who feels like beating him up let me know.

It was a really fun class but I'm in a lot of pain. I'm also waiting for Josh to call me so I can get to bed. I want to talk to him TONIGHT!

Actually at this very moment shes in my room watching 7th Heaven. I'm going to go in there in a minute and do some homework. We're going to church tonight.  Should be fun. Except my moms going to bitch cause I got 2 threes on my report card thingy but I'm trying to bring them up. I'm trying really damn hard to bring them up actually. Oh well its her problem. Josh and I are getting to be back the way we were when Jared and I were dating..was it Jared or Jason? I don't know probably both.  Well its cool.  We're e-mailing back and forth now and talking on the phone when we get the chance. I will have the chance alot this week. I can't go to my martial arts stuff at all until next Tuesday or Wednesday. Its really going to suck. Well time for work!  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-03-11 13:22:47 ----- BODY: ::tear:: Josh didn't e-mail me today. I might just cry.  But I don't think I will.  I had a crazy dream last night. First it was Thursday and I was going to Ninjutsu. Then we did class and everything was normal. Then after class I was waiting for Lucas to take me home, he had to stay for a long time after class because he was testing for his goldbelt in the Bujinkan style of Ninjutsu.  Josh and Dusty were there and had to wait to. So we waited together.  Then we were going to go sit on some couched by a TV in the basement.  Josh and Dusty had to do something first so I went by myself. Then when I got down there Alicia Pickett was sitting there by the floor. Which is weird cause she doesn't do Ninjutsu and I don't like her. Then she was like so which of these hotties is going to sit by you (there were two couches only big enough for 2 people if your lucky). I gave her a weird look and said Josh probably I don't know. Then she was like oh ok.  Josh and Dusty got down there. Dusty sat by me, which was weird. Josh kind of gave him some funny looks and so did I cause I don't know Dusty that well. Then he was like whispering stuff in my ear I don't remember what but it was about Josh. Then we were watching Finding Nemo. It was fun. Next it flipped and Josh, Dusty, and I were sitting on the stairs talking and waiting for our rides (we had decided to find a different way home). Then Josh was being super weird and he kept thinking of dumb reasons to have me super close to him and I was like weirdo but whatever. Then he kissed me. It was really touching in the dream until Dusty was like "So how did you like that Cassie?". lol I was just like I liked it alot. Then my ride showed up so I had to go out the door. When I got to Jasons truck I realized I had forgotten my top upstairs so I had to run back up and get that. As I was running up the stairs I saw Ron pull up to get Dusty and Josh.  I waved to him. Then I ran upstairs. Then I had to go up a super weird way. There were these little magic carpet things that went up and down but you had to lay on your back on them. I was in a hurry so I tried to get on the closest one but it was almost gone so I had to hurry up and flip my legs on to it and pray I made it. Well I didn't. I was falling over the edge. So I did a really awesome back flip and grabbed onto the edge of my carpet and let go so I would land on the next one. Then I got my top and went back to the parking lot. Ron and Josh and Dusty were gone. I went over to Jason and Tomies trucks ( I thought I was riding with Jason but I didn't know cause Tomie was still there ). Brian was in the car with Jason. Jason all of a sudden had a 2 ft. long joint in his hand. I was like what the hell are you doing. He said smoking cocaine or crack I'm not sure which one he said. Then he light it up. I think my dream went into fast forward mood because the next thing I knew the joint was at the VERY end and there was smoke everywhere. Brian just sat there dumbstruck. I was like I am not riding with you so I turned to get in Tomie truck but I saw smoke coming out of his windows to. Then Jason was like you are riding with me. I was like no I'm not and told him to give me his keys cause he wasn't driving either. THen Jason went ballistic. He got out of the car and told me to get in the truck. I was like no. So he grabbed me and threw me into the truck. Next Tomie got out of his truck. They both just started pounding on me. After this went on for like 5 fucking minutes Mr. Marr came out. As soon as he gave them the look of "I'm going to kill you" they got in their cars and drove away as fast as possible. Mr. Marr was like I'll take you home.  I was like ok. I was bleeding and I think I had a broken arm and had reinjured my ankle and I was bleeding from my head and had a fat lip and a cracked tooth and black eyes and a broken nose. (IT WAS BAD).  Then I got in the car with Mr. Marr. We drove for what seemed like an hour when Sokol is only 5 minutes from my house. We didn't end up at my house. We ended up back at Sokol. He got out of the car and I was like why are we here and he was like this is where you live. I was like...?  Then he walked into the building. There were a bunch of gymnasts in the parking lot where I was so they all started asking me what happened and if I was ok and stuff. Then 5 seconds after Mr. Marr had walked in the building with his regular clothes on he came out with his awesome guy uniform and 5th Degree Black Belt on.  It was weird. Then I was like what time is it? Mr. Marr said 3:30 AM.  I was like oh crap I have to go home and get ready for school. Then one of the gymnast were like you have school on Sat. I was like no. Then they were like then what are you talking about school. I was like its Friday duh then they were like no its Sat. and I was like oh great how the hell did that happen I'm going to be in so much trouble....then it changed scenes again.  I was at home. My moms phone rang. It was Jared. I talked to him for 2 seconds then he said hold on and put his sister on the phone. His sister told me that Jared had his VERY OWN underwear. I was like Wow does he have his VERY OWN place to put it and she was like no...and started talking about his underwear. Then my phone started to ring so I said hold on. She didn't hear my but I set the phone down anyways.  Then I answered my other phone I said  "what up?" They said nothing much is this Cassie and I said yeah and as soon as I did I heard someone knocking at my door. When I opened my door Josh and Dusty were there and Dusty and cell phone in his hands. I looked at them confused and hang up both phones. Then we went to my basement and Josh started telling me that he missed me and he loved and he just poured his heart out to me. Then we got back together and it was all dandy. I loved that part lol!!  Then I woke up. It was a weird dream with different parts but a good ending.  lol anyways~~~~~~~~    Today went well. I didn't have any problems. I registered for High School with all my required classes being honors. I also signed up for ROTC it shall be interesting. Umm I'm going to go do some stuff later! ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: shoot ashley DATE: 2004-03-11 19:12:11 nice dream...........? ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-03-12 16:30:01 It was an awesome dream, for some parts, and a nightmare in others.

Megan was in St. Louis so it wasn't super fun or anything. I volunteered at Habitat. I got a lot of work done. Megan is going to have a lot to catch up on when she gets back lol.  Then after volunteering I came home. My mom and sister left the house at about 6:20 and neither would be around for a while. SO I got to go to Ninjutsu and Demo Team.  Ninjutsu went good. I almost fainted cause I headbutted Ron, it really hurt. Then we had Demo Team.  Well we have the WOMENS SELF DEFENSE DEMO on Thursday so we were practicing for that. I have to do pretty much everything in it.  Megan and Alex weren't there and they might get to do a few techniques but I have to do 6 advanced techniques, show off techniques that Mr. Doss wants me to, and teach people some basic stuff. Its very nerve racking for me. But it should be fun. Then I came home, I had to climb in my window. Now I was hurting from doing all that shit out class and stuff so it was really hard to get in a window but I made it. I almost died though lol. Then I just sat here watching tv for a while. Then I was on the phone with Josh.  He was with Aaron and Aaron asked Josh to ask me if I would give him $10 and I said yes. So then Josh and Aaron were going to come over and get the money. That was at like 11 when they left.  Then I had to stay up and wait for them and then at 2:30 Josh came climbing through my window (I was half asleep on my futon by then).  I was like holy shit. Then Josh came and sat by me for a little while and we talked and shit.  It was fun. It felt like old times. Then Aaron wanted to leave cause he was waiting outside and there were cops all over the place (I think he was stoned or drunk or something and I think he had beer in his car and hes underaged).  So Josh had to leave...::tear::.  But then this morning Megan called me from St. Louis YAY!! Shes alive and fine....she sounded kind of bored but who wouldn't be with there family.  Then Jason called after I showered and was getting ready to eat. I talked to him for a while, but he was yelling at me for the Aaron and Josh thing and stuff and dissing on them even though Aaron is his cousin and shit. I really wanted to tell Jason off, but I can't.  He loves me so much but I just don't have those same feelings for him.  But I don't know how to deal him without hurting him. But oh well. Josh is on the phone so I'm going to get off of here and talk to him.  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-03-13 22:17:55 ----- BODY: Well today went well. Josh didn't get to come over. His dad decided he had plans lol. Thats ok though Josh will probably come over tomorrow. I'm babysitting right now. The kids are all asleep, well duh its midnight lol.  I spent most of my day sleeping and talking to Josh on the phone it was cool. I read him a letter I wrote to him one day at school when I was especially depressed about him. It was sad.  I almost started crying when I read it to him but I didn't. I told him I might start crying if I read it and then he was like well then tomorrow I'll be over there and you can cry on my arm or whatever lol it was so funny. He sounded silly saying that. Tomorrow I have to go to Tomies, its also my moms b-day. I don't think we are doing anything for her. I didn't even get her a present. I'm to durn broke. But yeah.  I'm making Mac and Cheese, the spiral kind its going to be fun!  lol oh yeah and I talked to this guy with Psychic powers and I just gave him a name and asked him what he thought. And he said Don't just don't. Then he said promise me you won't. It was creepy. He said someone or something is going to keep us apart no matter what. That thing or person won't let me have Jason. I was like sweet. Really I just wanted to know if by some not cool thing we ended up together, that would suck.  It was weird. I also asked about Josh. He said good stuff about him it was pretty awesome.  But yeah time to eat.  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-03-15 13:24:48 ----- BODY: Joshua came over yesterday. It was so great! I loved having him here.  I has missed him so much, if you couldn't tell by some of my other posts lol. Wow its like I'm obsessed. Josh did read my other posts. I think. I'm not sure which ones he read but I think he read most of them.  He didn't say anything about what they said or anything. Something he said bothered me.  He told me that people have told him how much I care about him. Well the only person who I ever told was Megan and the only other people who saw us together were people at Ninjutsu and he said it wasn't them. He told me Dusty was one of them but that he couldn't remember who else and that it didn't matter anyways because he could tell.  Then I was like I know you can tell but I don't like that other people could tell. Oh well. It doesn't matter to me its not like they got the wrong impression because they got the right one. Thats always good. But yeah everything was going really damn good, and then my mom showed up. We had to get Josh out of there before she noticed, and we did manage to do that. It was pretty awesome. But yeah. I'm so tired right now. I fell asleep on the phone with Josh last night. I feel bad but I was extremely tired and really wanted to talk to him but oh well. I think I'm going to go take a nap since my mother won't take me to the doctor, she laughed at me when I told her my appendix was dieing, but I didn't word it like that I was serious about it but yeah. So if I die blame my mom.  ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-03-16 16:04:36 ----- BODY: Well I'm sitting here, sick. It sucks. I didn't go to school today. I got really bored. I e-mailed Josh and Megan some really long e-mails though. That was kind of cool. And fun and whatever lol. I'm waiting for Josh to call me back right now. I have been on the phone continuously for 2 hours, and thats weird because I hate talking on the phone when I'm sick.  I sound super fucking weird and it bothers me. Oh well though. I've been in such a bad mood all day. But then Josh called me like 30 minutes ago and I got all hyper and happy. Thats so awesome. Josh was thinking about coming over today. But it would be kind of pointless cause he could only be here for a couple hours and thats dumb,but its worth it to me, but not today.  I probably look like crap.  Not that Josh would care. But I also don't want to get him sick. I hope I'm all better by Thursday. If I'm not I might cry cause I would still have to do the demo and I would feel and look like shit. But oh well.  I'll survive.  No ninjutsu tonight. I feel like I'm being neglected since I don't have class lol. Wow well I think I'm going to listen to music and talk to Megan and then go eat some food. I'm starving! ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-03-31 18:01:37 ----- BODY: Well that Demo I was talking about, no one showed up.  Except a few wife/fiance people and my wifey!!  Lol thats fun to say.  It was very sad but not out fault though.  I'm ground until April 26th. I can't go to class and I can't go out or have people over. Now thats me being deprived. I might just cry.  Actually I did. But oh well. I still got to go to the VENACULAS CONCERT!  Brit, Delanie, Megan, Alex, Jason, John, Ryan, Mahoney, Trina, Skye, Nick, Wess, Mike, Wendy, and some other people were there. Delanie was hanging out with some drunk guys. I didn't like that. I don't trust people. I was worrying about my Delanie the whole time. At one time I had to stop having a great time and go make sure she was cool. I don't know why she didn't come with us to up by the stage but she didn't.  Who knows!! Megan and I went CROWD SURFING!  That was like the best experience ever I swear.  Except I pulled a muscle in my neck. They dropped me on my ass/back/head and then they dropped Megan and Alex one after the other on me both happening to land on my head. Megan and I went unconscious.  It was so painful but it was so awesome!!!  After that we just sat in the bathroom until it was almost over. Then we went back to my house and chilled. Delanie and Brit did I mean.  Then after a while Jason came over.  That wasn't to awesome. I'm still into Jason but when we're together he doesn't keep his hands off me and it bothers me. Josh does.  He always hold my hand and either has his other hand on my stomach (hes obsessed) or has his other hand stroking my face/hair gently. Its so cute and I love it.  Josh doesn't know but thats one of the things that I love about him. And the way when we're just sitting there he will kiss me on the cheek or forehead for no reason at all. I love it!!!!!!  Josh is super amazing. Except he doesn't care.  He doesn't care what I think about him or if he hurts my feelings.  Well I'm sure he cares if he hurts my feelings but I don't know.  Its weird.  Josh is a very confusing guy. Weird. But yeah I still love the guy. Well I'm on my moms computer and I'm not supposed to be so I think I will get off of here now!!  Later dayz!   ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-04-04 00:41:57 ----- BODY: Well right now its 3:20 A.M. and I have to go to church in like 5 hours. This blows. I want to go to sleep. BUt I have to wait for Miranda and Chris to come home so they can take me home. I was babysitting tonight. First Aidan was all sickly. Then he drooled on my pants. Then Ryan woke up and he had had quite in accident in Miranda and Chris's bed. His shirt and pants were soaked. It was very very disgusting. Believe me I would have much rather been at Brits Party then here but hey thats ok. I still love my nephews and I would do anything to help Miranda so yeah.  I hate being grounded!! Today Lucas, Kate, Alex, and Megan all went to the zoo without me. I felt so unloved even though they had invited me but of course I had to decline....::tear::.  Now I'm really bored and have been for the past two weeks or so. Its sad!! I might get grounded for longer. I snuck out to Ninjutsu and Demo Team Practice on Friday night. And we had a demo on Sat. that I was going to sneak out for but I didn't get to do that. My mom made me help her with yard work YUCK!!  Jay is going to kick my ass when he sees me too. But that probably won't be until the next demo so yeah who knows. Very scary. Megan has been talking to people telling them that I have problems with weed or something. Thats not true and shes not making me to happy. But oh well its what she feels theres nothing I can do about it.  I'm always going to have problems living at my house.   My sister is a beehotch who hates me and my mom is a 13 year old girl right now. Not a mom. Its very sad.  And without Ninjutsu or Tae Kwon Do I'm going crazy.  BTW I might be pregnant. Now this is super bad and I'm super scared. But I don't know yet.  It will be a while before I find out for sure that I am.  I'm not TOO worried about it though.  But I just hope its not Jason's cause he would be in jail in like 2 seconds. That would suck balls dude.  Friday Megan, Jason, and I went to Old Chicago for food and then we went to class together.  I liked being out with Jason.  At one time Jason was excorting me and Megan. Then he was like "whats up with this?" and Megans like "Your a pimp just enjoy it." Then Jason was like "I don't need to be a pimp I have all I want on my right side"  Thats the side I was on. I felt so loved. Then after class Jason took me home. We sat in his truck and talked until almost 11 but then he had to leave cause he was sick and tired. I got Jason sick and now I think he got me sick again. Which really blows or it was Aidan cause I think Aidan is sick.  Babies get people sick super easy. Miranda and Chris said I would be home at about 2, well guys its 3:30 now. You can come home any minute. I have to go home and shower and then go to bed. I will probably die in the shower because I won't be able to stand up and then I will fall and hit my head and the water will over fill and I shall drown.  Lol but I doubt that will happen. My mom is making me go out of town April 30th to May 3rd for my cousins confirmation. I don't want to go. I'm supposed to party with Josh on May 1st for his 18th b-day and thats the first weekend I get off grounding and I wanted to spend it with Megan. I'm also going to miss three more Ninjutsu/TKD classes. How sad. But I will miss 2 days of school. That sucks to cause I can't really risk missing school right now. Its not a good idea for me at this time.  I'm having enough problems at school. But yeah everyone keeps telling me to give up Josh and go with Jason.  They don't understand how hard that is. I want Josh to go back to the way he was the first few months we were dating. He was amazing. I loved him to death!! He made me so happy and I want that back. I would go with Jason but I can't see him and he makes me uncomfortable. I hate kissing him. Its like hes trying to choke me with his own tongue. Its not to cool at all. My back hurts and so does my stomach and throat.  This is sad.  All I want to do is go home. I would call Jason and have him come get me and take me home but Miranda would kill me if I left Aidan and Ryan. Ryan is still awake. Sad.  Their home I think there is lots of car slamming door thingys going on lol.  I shall post when I get the chance.   ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-04-14 19:16:19 ----- BODY: Well yeah I don't have much to write about right now.  Except the pregnancy thing.  Well I'm going on Sat. most likely to see whats up. I had a dream about it.  I found out that I am then I was at my martial arts demo and afterward I went up to Josh and told him I was pregnant. I started to cry and Josh hugged me and then everyone started freaking out and asking what was wrong and then I got pissed and screamed the truth out. It was bad. igot dirty look and I thought everyone hated me it sucked and I think thats probaby what will happen if I am. But life will go on.  I think I can handle this pretty well.  My life that I had planned will be over but I will have a new life. And it will be destiny. Everything will be the way it is supposed to be cause everything is meant to be. This won't be a mistake it will be meant to be and thats all there is to it. That goes the same for el someone elseo who might be reading this with the same problemo.  ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: shoot ashley DATE: 2004-04-14 19:44:05 so whats the verdict? ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-04-15 13:19:52 The verdict is not decided yet but is a strongly guessed to be the poo poo verdict ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: shoot ashley DATE: 2004-04-15 13:25:08 im sorry im here for ya kidd! ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-04-15 13:39:03 lol your midget self did not just call me kid lol jk thanks girlie!

Its like Shayla and her "Kids these days" ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: shoot ashley DATE: 2004-04-15 16:26:51 haha ya   ----- -------- TITLE:  AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-04-15 13:38:31 ----- BODY: Well dude I think I'm going crazy.  All this pregnancy stuff is stuck in my mind it won't go away. Brit and I were talking today and I told her why I thought I was and she explained something to me and said that there was a good chance I was. Now I'm scared. If I am pregnant my life that I wanted to life is over. I won't be getting my blackbelt anytime soon.  I will no longer be a Martial Artist until at least a year from now or something like that.  I won't be able to go to the gym and do the stuff I wanted to this summer. I will need to get the job I was planning on getting.  My mom will go insane and kick me out and never speak to me or Josh again. Jason will stop speaking to me completely and probably the same for Tomie.  I don't know though.  Its very hard.  Josh is probably going to try and get me to give the baby up for adoption but I don't think I'm strong enough to do that. That would be really hard for me.  It would feel like I abandoned my child. I would hate myself.  But if I keep it my life will be changed for more than just a year.  I probably won't be able to finish school but I think I probably could.  If I did there would be little chance that I still had been able to do all of the extra curricular activities I had planned on and then there is no way I will get into Stanford.  Its hard to think what life will be like with a kid. I know all my friends and people who care about me will make it easier and so will Josh but still. Its going to be hard. I hope I'm freaking out for nothing though.  If I am I'm going to cry with joy and with stupidity on my part. But I have to lie so I can go get this test. This is already going bad for me. I'm so sick of lieing.  But as soon as I'm off grounding there will be no lieing coming from me. I mean the little white lies that you so so you don't hurt anyones feelings are ok but not the bad ones like I've had to tell.  I hate lieing and sneaking around thats one of the other big things that bothers me about Jason. I have to lie to see him and I hate it so I'm done with that to now I think. Wow I think this post is growing out of control.  April 26th or 25th I will be getting off grounding. About 10 more days. I'm counting them down. I hope my mom doesn't ground me for any longer because of my father. But yeah she probably will which will suck. But I don't know. I'll be out of town the weekend of May 1st my first weekend off grounding. But I will get to see my cousin in Minnesota. That will be pretty cool.  We always have fun together. Then May 8th will be partying with Alex, Megan, Amanda, Josh, and Alex's friends.  Should be cool. Then May 15th I hope Brit will be having that party in my honor lol.  That would be so cool.  I would have so much fun. But then there would still be a whole bunch of people there I don't like. I'm trying to convince her not to invite them though. I don't though. April 30th is Venaculas. Should be fun. I will have to go late and after Ninjutsu but I shall be there one way or another damn it hehe.  Well hmmm....I don't really have anything else to say cause I think I just wrote out my life but yeah.  ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: gripewater DATE: 2004-04-15 13:49:21 If you want to know the truth about having kids, come talk to me.    No offense to your friend Brit- but you need to get other opinions.    You may be worried over nothing.      As a Mom (and an adult...) etc etc if you can tell me the first day of your last period,  the date you had unprotected sex and your "symptoms"?    Maybe I can help you.    There are also over the counter tests that can be performed as early as 5 days after conception.     ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-04-15 15:18:52 Ok the first day of my last period was a month late and only lasted 1 and 1/4 days. It was April 5th. The day I had unprotected sex was ummm 3 weeks ago today.  My symptoms are the period thing.  I've been feeling extra tired and when I'm running to a class or something I start feeling dizzy and that never happens cause I'm in pretty good shape.  Also I've been feeling nausea(haven't thrown up yet) and having weird cravings for food I don't usually eat. This Sat. I'm probably going to a clinic to get tested for free because I have no money and I'm in trouble so there is no way I could get a test.  So what do you think?  ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: gripewater DATE: 2004-04-15 15:59:13 Period 2/5  Missed 3/5  Unprotected Sex 3/25  Spotted 4/5    When I tried to get pregnant, I would wait until I had my period, then count 10 days from the first day... that is when most women ovulate.      So, I had my period like 7/29, and then had sex 8/11... took test on 9/1, had baby 4/16.    But what you are saying is that you were already two weeks late; when you had sex, correct?  Then you spotted... so it is hard to tell when you REALLY ovulated.    However, not having your period or even having an irregular one at your age is not uncommon!  Your body is so chock full of hormones, lots of stuff can happen.    The fact that you were irregular before having sex is what makes me highly suspicious.    Those symptoms- well I didn't get any of those until I was 3-4 mos along.    So, I think you need to take the test on Sat. for peace of mind- and when you are there if it does prove false, please please please, get on the pill.      The pill will help you have regular periods, give you a nice clear complextion AND provide birth control.    I know you don't want to hear this but you should really speak with your Mom/Dad. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-04-15 16:12:06 Oops I was mistaken in my typing, my period was a week late.  And my period is always regular. Nothing weird ever happens to it.  I've had my period for 4 years now and at first it was weird but after 6 months it was perfect and I could always time it. Then it went crazy and got me scared. But yeah. I might get on the pill but I have to get a job before I can get on it I have no money.  ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: gripewater DATE: 2004-04-15 16:21:31 You NEED to tell the Doctor this information, it is important they know you were once regular, and then you skipped.    Like I said before, it could be *anything*, if you type in "missed your period" in the internet, a zillion reasons come up.    In CA at our health clinics, the pill is free.  Yours may be too.    Usually it is based on how much you earn, if you don't earn anything or it is a hardship- then you are free.    The State would so much rather give you pills then help support you and a baby in the future.    There are also bc patches.    Planned Parenthood is also a great source of information. ----- COMMENT: AUTHOR: NinjaMonkey DATE: 2004-04-15 16:24:52 Alright thanks for your help ----- --------
