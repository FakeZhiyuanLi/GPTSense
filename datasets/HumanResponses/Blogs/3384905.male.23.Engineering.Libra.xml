						   Being sensible is one of the greatest attributes of human nature. I would define it as the ability to perceive, logically analyze and express the impact of an occurrence; any occurrence.   In due course of our day to day activities, I believe, that a major percentage of incidents around us goes unnoticed.   “The roads that I take for jogging always appear litter free. Yesterday, when I returned, I had littered the very spot that I just passed! It had always been like that; but today I happened to notice it! And then I found my parking spot intact for me, devoid of any invasion! I get my ironed clothes and break fast sharp at 8. All these and many more which is part of a routine; never thought of how and when. I enjoy the privilege of being treated well; may be because I had been the best in all my actions.  The burger that I had yesterday was very tasty. I could have even had the foil! Of course I had to restrain myself from submitting to the last bit of cream on it, owing to the social implications! The foil… and where would that be now? The last thing I remember is seeing it fly off thorough my car window. Would it have it the sweeper on the pavement? Not that I bothered, just fooling around with thoughts.”   The thoughts lingering around, I was trying to see myself as one of the most privileged individuals of this society. But once I emphasize on my ability of perception, I had it all viewed in a different angle. This is where I for once start to analyze.  The pavement was neat. It gave a perfect atmosphere for me to complete my jogging. It was provided to me by the sweeper who cleaned the streets overnight. My watch man made sure I get my usual parking lot and my beloved mother made my bed, ironed my clothes and had my break fast ready at 8.  A little thought made me ask another question. I love my mother for sure, but the sweeper and the watch man… I never ever have met them. I never do a good to a stranger, unless of course recommended by any one I know. Then how could some one do some thing good for me? Of course they are paid for it. It is part of their job. The real question was were they happy with the job or is there a motivation in them to make sure that the stage is set for me to perform?  One thing I know for sure is that for what ever things I do at my office, I would enjoy my boss coming back and letting me know his appreciation! The next day I moved my car in. I had the same watch man who stood to open me the door.  “Thank you” . I wispered with a quick smile. It hardly took a couple of seconds. I could see his face lit up! I should add here, it made me happy as well! That evening, when I returned to get my car, I found it clean. My watch man had his place occupied in the corner. Smiles exchanged. “I am a better man today.” Was it my inner voice?   I wish I saw the sweeper. One day I might. But there was a greater thing to do.  I went home; for the first time in weeks, I sat down with my mother and had dinner. I spoke to her about many things. I kissed her good night,  “Thank you for being there for me.” The glitter in her eyes… it spoke of the most ever lasting feeling, ‘Love’.   Now I thank any one for any action I see to be good. I see that it is good and it has improved my life. I see smiles whenever and wherever I walk, see people. This is magic. This is the impact my little thought had made to my life.  Once you are done with this passage,  I thank you for the time you spent with me!

						   Lot of us wonder about the purpose of life. The perception that one holds on life reflects on their thoughts and actions. With a normal personality, one should not struggle much with the thoughts of being self. The problem comes when one is prompted to think on self in relation with another.   The man who crossed the road would have made no impact on me, had he not come under my car. The women I saw at the ATM would not have mattered, if she had not given a glance. I would have never gone there, had it not been for my friend. This is how life takes its course! For some this turns out to be advantageous and for some, not. But the important thing is to be aware of the possibility that every time one makes a move a lot of other factors are impended on. That women I saw at the ATM might turn out be my wife a couple years from now. The man who crossed the road could have made me spent a few years of my life in detention.  Once this realization is made, the mystery of life starts unfolding in front of our eyes. We feel pain just because it makes us realize the value of a smile. My loses makes me treasure my victories. The person who came under my car would some time become my greatest friend and I may not ever see the other women. My life goes on… till one day I take an off and see for myself where I am. The day I would remember the point where I had an old women cross the road and got her blessings; a leaper was denied any alms. Then I sit down and think of how the string has taken me thorough the years, what went right and what not, what could have been changed and what not, if something could have been changed, then how?  The real food for thought is when I exactly found time to sit back! Am I late, that I have things too complex for me? To me any time is perfect until one has the courage to look at ones own life, the will power to say that I went wrong and the wisdom to sort it out. This is what a prayer can do to you, a time off to oneself and the necessary courage, power and wisdom!

						   Every one has a dream. Every game show which perceptually tests ones personality has these questions put forward,  “if you were not what you are, then what would you like to be?”  or  “given an option where would you like to be?”   I have some answers of my own.  Last day, I was watching a children’s movie (oh yes! I am child at heart). The parting dialogue in the movie is,  “Well, just because we cannot see something, it does not mean that it is not there.”   Although the reason I watched the movie was because I was tired of my finance lessons, this sentence made me contemplate over the relevance of it in our day to day life. There is a wonderful wall paper that  urlLink Hallmark  brought out which says,  “Seeing is Believing” . The poster had a beautiful lady and a kid; of course my memories revolved around the lady! Now, the reason I brought up the story of the poster is because what it said contradicted what I just heard from a kid. I thought it would be appropriate to decide which would be the most relevant or the most followed in my life.  As a kid, I had some of the beautiful moments when my granny sat down with me narrating glorious episodes of the princess and the prince who came to save her; the fairy who comes secretly at night to hear my wishes and take them to God who grants them; the other fairy who fought off all the treacherous monsters off my room and many more. She was so articulate and expressive that every time she starts telling me the stories, I could see her transform to the princess and the fairy. I still know how much I wished to see the fairy and give her my detailed list so that she could bring me exactly what I wanted. Though I never saw her, I always knew she was there and I believed when my granny said,  “You be a good boy and drink your milk and fairy would soon come to see you!”   I moved to upper grades and I was introduced into a much modern world. The world of  machos ; the one in which I could not see my fairy and I was to believe that she was never there, because if I did not, I could never be part of the big league. I of course cherished my dreams and I am pretty sure that almost all my friends did, but were too proud to say it out loud.  I was filled with law of  urlLink Gravitation  and  urlLink Relativity  and all I know is that if I follow a discrete set of procedures, I would get a result which is suppose to denote the ultimate truth which is worth believing. I was being crafted into a man. The people who crafted me were pretty dexterous, I should say; now that I can sit down and put my thoughts down!  The actual point is that after all those years of rigorous training and brain wash; I still believe that I am the disciple of the kid’s philosophy. Well, I believe that we all are. I have no idea of the percentage of atheist within our population. The amoung rest, who I believe still forms the majority, the number of people who actually saw God would be negligible (I am assuming this because the priest of my church had once said that the  urlLink   Holy Pope    usually speaks with God personally). I do not wish to go into the theological altercation. The point I wanted to make is that we still believe in God, though I have never seen him personally! Again I believe that  urlLink Jimi Hendrix  was just human, where as is his music is so out of this world! And oh yes, every night as I go to sleep, I make a list of things to do tomorrow.  It has not caused any damage to me being imaginative and by believing what I could not see. It just provided me a wonderful way to lead my life. When I see my granny, I am as excited to see her as she is, to lie in her lap and sail in the world of stories. It brings to life the special bond I have with her. It rejuvenates my mind which could other wise be filled with thought of my finances, my machine designs or the new job I am due to take. I realize that it was far better then when I was five and I long to be there. And when it is time to move back into the city after my vacations, I long for my next vacations.   I once read,  “Child is the father of man! ”  I believe it. The one thing I could trade for my entire assets would my childhood. Though I cannot see it coming towards me, I still believe that it is some where there and I just need to search for it. It may be with the love of my life or with the kids we would have or may be even when I turn sixty or seventy. But the most significant thing is to preserve our childhood within ourselves. It keeps us young at heart.   As I walk back into my real world I hum….      “Some day I’ll be, Young at five; With ones I love and who loves me most…”

						   We have been taught  “Knowledge is Wealth” . The past few days of my life have gone by with incidents which made me juggle around with on this saying.  ‘What is wealth?’  I would not swing the focus on to   urlLink Adam Smith’s   definition of wealth, but I tried to answer the question in my own perspective.    To me friendship is the greatest wealth an individual can have.   I may not be the most elegant or successful person on the earth, but   if I have a few good friends, then I would not be lonely in this wide world!   Being lonely could be one of most awful dream I could ever have! It may not be the same for all, but I am positive that every one of us would need a company or rather would long for a companion at some point of time. What I feel is that a person who has at least one dependable friend is a blessed guy.  Many people count me as sentimental or an expressionist when I emphasize the need of having good friendship and keeping it. I admit that I tend to become a little emotional with relationships as well. That is who I am and I do not look down on me for it. I am quite happy that I have friends whom  I am sure would be there for me….or at least  for whom I am sure that I would be there for . I like the feelings to be expressed; I respect my friends’ feelings and would definitely take the first step to resolve an issue. I felt that this always helped me to keep my friends.  Last day a friend of mine made remarks on avoiding teasing comments between friends, when we share a good moment. To this, I had commented that a limit has to be maintained and that I believe that a  friendship should stay afloat in any circumstance.  I had to give it a little thought and I realized that some times between friends, we take things for granted. The friendship would have lasted for a prolonged period that one tends to believe that he/she knows every thing about other person. This might turn fatal owing to the fact that human nature is unfathomable. I could state something from my own life for this: I used to be a very hot tempered guy when I was in my teens. I had friends, and I believed that our relationship was simply great. It was accidental that one day I said a joke to which every one stood surprised… it was for the first time that I made a joke on myself. I found that it appealed a lot to my friends and I could use it to make the relationship livelier. Now, that did not mean that I lost my tempered character. But being with my friends I realized that being hot tempered would not do any good to my life… it could as well bring misery! I tried to adapt and I believed that all my friends were to adapt too. I took them for granted. And then was a day when I found out that I was not correct when an offhand comment took one of my friends away from the group. It was just a mistake or rather something that I forgot. But it cost me a friend!  It was a grave feeling to lose a friend. It was painful realizing that I had been instrumental for this agony. To be honest I do not know till now, why I felt so. Was it because I knew he is never going to come back or was it because I knew it was tedious to find another friend like him? I could really live with out him! Every thing remains the same! But one thing I know is that even after so many years,  I still miss him and I really wish could change that one moment.    I think that any friendship should be of a standard as to forgive and forget. As I mentioned earlier, it would be ideal if friendship could stay afloat in all circumstances. But it is being reveled to me that it is not an easy thing after all. A certain amount of commitment is required to keep such a blessed relationship, which I feel is the underlying wave of all other relationship or rather   friendship is the essence that ads a special touch to any other relationship  , be it be between a couple, kids and parents or any other relationship we could visualize. My experience tells me that  it is easy to find a friend, it is difficult to find a true friend and  it is tedious to be a true friend  .   When you long for a true friend; try to be one…   and you could see everything you longed for would just follow you!

						   The study of human behavior is perhaps one of the most significant and extensive area of investigation amoung the sciences. This owes to the fact that the human nature has extravagant and assorted faces! Many believe that it would be impossible to find two people from a sample lot who share all the attributes. To be more judgmental, it has already been proved that no two atoms are same. So, a person should be flawlessly reasonable when he emphasizes that,  “I am different!”   Since the emphasis is on human nature, to move away from being diverse, a thought occurred to me on what could possibly be squared on as the single common attribute of all people? What is that every person likes to uphold? What is that guides him? What could possibly be the cause for his strength, confidence and pride? Some of these are the commonly heard dialogues in our day to day life:   “I think that should be due to ……”  “I knew it would ……”  “I believe ……”   That should be it!  Belief.  Belief is what guides a person. It is what gives him the urge to live. I believe that my destination is near and my belief shows me the way. I know that I am going to get there; sooner or later. It is the same belief that gives a mother the strength to carry her baby through the ten months and then go through the incredible labor pain; the conviction that she is a part of the true miracle of life. I go to sleep every night peacefully as I believe that I am going to wake up the next day at dawn and I would have a whole new and vivid day ahead of me. I leave home saying, “Honey, I’ll see you at eight for dinner” because I believe that I would be there by my beloved, which I so much long for.   Now, it could be universal to have some beliefs, but it requires substantial courage to stand up for what one believes in. This owes to the principles of life, which I am sure every one would cherish. I could believe in something and every day that pass would undoubtedly bring forth challenges to my beliefs. I say,  “I believe in father the God almighty and his only Son…………”  every day in front of the alter and may not even bother to abide it by being a good son! One could say I believe that the politics is fraudulent and has to be cleansed off and would not even bother to vote!    ‘No wonder, the world is full of Hypocrites!’     But there are people who stood up to their beliefs and believed they can!   Had it not for them, man would have never conquered the Everest and the Moon. We could have had no airplanes, leave airplanes… not even cars!  Every thing that we see in this world is a testimonial of someone’s belief. It is an ovation to the fact that some one stood up to the challenges, the test of time and society because he trusted in his belief; in himself. This is what every one should do. Say this to yourselves,    “My life may not be the way I wanted it to be, I am may not be seen as a person I want to be, something might not be going the way it should be; but sooner or later I am going to be the person I believe I am, because I trust and believe that I can.”   This belief could be your  'Miracle Worker' !

						       Disclaimer: This story was part of a forwarded mail that the author received. This is published as an article, as an effort not to send it around as forwards. The opinion expressed in the story need not necessarily reflect the views of the author. Enjoy the story.                One day, 16years old a girl, heard from her mother that if she does a regular prayer for four years, a divine "Devi" will come to her dreams & give her three boons. So she decided to do it. She completed 4 years successfully, doing the prayer regularly. Now it was a day for "Devi" to come. So she slept early with thoughts in her mind to ask. And, really a "Devi" comes in her dreams. The following narration was their conversation.                                                                Devi:  "O Girl, you prayed to me regularly within last 4yrs, so I am very very happy with you. I will complete any of your 3 wishes. You can ask anything you like, but there is one condition."     Girl:  "Condition! What?"     Devi:  "Do you have a boy-friend?"     Girl:  "Yes."     Devi:  "When you were doing the prayer, he was waiting for you, so he also sacrificed same as you. Moreover, he didn’t know anything about boon and all, so he is also eligible for the boons. So whatever you will ask, he will get ten times more than that of you. If you are agreed, then proceed for the first boon."     Girl:   (After thinking for some time ...) " Yes, I am ready."     Girl:  "Make me 10 times richer than the richest person in the world."     Devi: " But your boy-friend will be 10 times richer than you."     Girl:  "That's OK."        Devi:  "Be as you wish!"     Girl:  "Now, Make me 10 times more beautiful than the most beautiful girl in the world."     Devi:  "But your boy-friend will be 10 times handsome than the most handsome boy in the world."     Girl:  "That's OK."     Devi:  "Be as you wish."     Devi:  "Now the last boon."     Girl:  "O Devi, please give me a  MILD HEART-ATTACK ."     Devi:  "What? Are you sure?"     Girl:  "Yes. Very much!"     Devi:  "Be as you wish."    Think friends,  what happened to her boy-friend; he got a severe heart-attack & died at once, while the girl remained alive. Thus, the girl became the world's most beautiful girl and the richest one, too.     Moral of the Story: 'The Girls are very intelligent! Girls are really more intelligent than we believe about them to be. So boys, be careful!'    Now, girls please stop reading ... boys may please continue till the end.....    ******    Dear boys, don’t worry, the real story goes like this. The boy got a heart-attack,  TEN TIMES MILDER  than that of the girl. So the boy-friend lived longer than the girl, being worlds richest and the most handsome boy.               Moral of the story: Dear boys, the girls are not really that much intelligent as what we believe them to be. So don’t worry if you think that you have girl-friend, intelligent than you. :-)

						      The search for freedom is one of the most frequented paths by any individual. The context of freedom conceived by each person would vary in accordance to the ‘attribute matrix’ that exists as part of every one. The shades of origin, nativity, religion, community, education etc would mould the path to the conquest of freedom. Freedom from ethnic disparities, financial and economic imbalances, human rights etc may be the conquests that are featured most in the brain storming sessions of international community.    As it is observed by many studies, an ordinary man may not associate most of these issues with his day to day thoughts and concerns. But there is one conquest that is linked with each and every person, the freedom from ‘Nostalgia’, his/her past. I have not seen any person who has had a completely satisfying life. The peripheral projected image in most cases would be deceiving.              Yesterday I saw a movie ‘Autograph’. The movie features the life of any ordinary person, who is on a retrospection. He has a reason for this journey as well, to invite his peers at school and college for his wedding. The initial destination is the village in Tamil Nadu where he did his schooling and we are shown the glimpses of the adolescent love he had then and later shows his love with her three kids. He moves on to Kerala, where he did his graduation and again a beautiful singer steals his heart. The love fails miserably and he is plunged into distress and resorts to the “ever so comforting, alcohol”! The sentiments from his parents urge him to go to the capital city in search of a job. The movie then features the unemployed youth with their tolerable difficulties. The hero comes up with an innovative idea of job search which gets attention of an advertising agency which hires them and suddenly they find themselves on the fast track. In between the hero meets his third ‘friend who is a girl’ who goes out of her way to support him especially when his love from Kerala, now a widow comes back to picture. In the end he is engaged to a fourth girl, who wonders whether he is a ‘love failure’ seeing the hero’s beard.             Now the reason I narrated the entire story is because the person featured in the movie has shades of all of us. He is one person captured by his past. Most of us have different issues. Though the movie could have finished in two hours instead of three and a half, I guess the rewind in our life goes for a life time. Almost every one of us fights this struggle. Some might be lucky to let loose some or most of the past but most are less fortunate. This struggle could make ones life miserable and I have seen many who burn their life in it.             I have followed a method which has made a considerable change in my life. I sure have had an “interesting past” and many who know me would agree on the same. There had been time when all the feelings crept into me. Then one day I saw a placard which said,   “Lent a Smile”  . It was a display board for one of the charitable institutions urging public to donate for a noble cause and had two jovial faces. The same day, when I was coming back in the bus, I saw a neatly dressed female, in her early twenties taking care of the kids from street. Those smiling faces in the ugly slumps brought a new insight in me. If only I could smile, every moment of my life, the world would have been a better place to live in. I came back and buried all my nostalgia within me and took a third person view on it. I realized that it is not so hard to smile. When I smiled I saw that the world around me had a smile within. I felt so good and energized. It just changed my world!             As ‘Ahimsa’ which gave freedom to our land, I feel a   smile   could bring freedom to us from all our distress. Be it the struggle for freedom from ‘Nostalgia’ or any thing else, any one who could smile at his past is bound to have a beautiful future ahead. The world might not change, but your perspective on it would change and that would change the world for you.              “Smile, for it is a virtue blessed with love” . It could change your life for ever.:-)

						   Loneliness is the most dreaded fear of all people. I have always ascertained it during my conversations, as well as mentioned it in one of my previous articles. A sudden realization that the days ahead would be left to oneself might awake the hidden fears in you. I felt the same on Thursday when I heard that all the inmates in my flat (except me, of course!) were leaving for the weekend. Well, it was not going to be life time loneliness, and hence it should not be anything critical. But my paranoid behavior had something to do with a conversation that I had with a friend of mine, who is soon going to tie the knots.  Off late, I had developed an idea that marriages are just another social obligation. It comes with a whole bunch of responsibility as you are no longer a free body. There is a person whose life has been tied to you and any minute decision of yours would affect the whole relationship. And with kids involved in the picture, the dimensions would go exponential! It is not that I want to run off the responsibilities, but just the realization that I take an awful time managing myself, I would just fall short of a booming relationship. I have had been in relationships before (my closest friends keep count, I do not!) and one thing I noticed is that your life is never the same when you start sharing it some one else. I wished my friend all the best and made a casual comment that  I have no intentions of getting married. He asked me to give it a second thought and reminded me of the loneliness that would come upon me in my later years.  Now coming back, I feared that the weekend is going to be dreadful. But lucky for me, it was not that bad. In fact I should say that I had a nice time some good experiences. Friday night was frantic, and I was busy calling any and all of my friends in Bangalore. It was surprising that none of them were in Bangalore, and for people who were in town, they had alternate plans. This was it. I had to take control.  First thing on the agenda was to fulfill the basic necessities. Now, shelter and clothing was the last concern (thank GOD!); food was the first. I went out, grabbed ‘real good chicken’, bread, milk and eggs which could get me through the entire weekend. I finished my cooking Friday night itself which left me nothing to do Saturday morning. I also had a small bottle of Bacardi and a couple of movies to keep me entertained. I decided to extent my search through the www (thanks to my friend Noufal, who incidentally had made arrangements for my transportation as well by gifting me his bike). I found an old friend of mine Arun (pakkaran) who is in Colombo on the net. The chat went on for an hour or so. It was time for lunch now, and with my deliciously prepared chicken and newly cooked rice, I had a nice time watching the movies. I composed my previous article on ‘five point someone’ that afternoon. The evening was spent at  urlLink  Alliance Francaise de Bangalore   with a painting exhibition and theater festival. The play   ‘Dancing on Glass’   was staged which showed the life of a Software Engineer and a girl who works in a Call Center. It was well crafted and the actors deserved appreciation. Moving forward to Sunday, I had my usual visit to church at 10. The Bangalore electricity department showed their blessing on my solitude as they decided to bunk the power supply for the entire day. So I was left with not much of options than to fiddle with the guitar (which incidentally again belongs to noufal.) Guru called to check on me, which was very considerate of him and we spoke for more than an hour and this was my first verbal conversation after Friday night! By five I went for a book exhibition at Institute of Engineers. I had an invitation from a friend of mine, Mohanettan, for dinner, which had to be postponed to Monday due to heavy rains. Oh yes, the rain was awesome and gave me a wonderful time near M.G. Road, where I was stuck for over an hour! I was waiting there under a tree when two  “professional ladies”  came near and offered a wonderful night. Was it the impulse or fear, the next second I found myself on the other side of the road in the  Ullas Restaurant  with a cup of coffee! With a wonderful dinner followed by movie sessions the weekend passed by peacefully.   My friends are back this morning and my days of solitude are over for the time being! One thing I realized is that being alone is not such a bad thing after all. It gives a lot of time to you. But the most important thing that I realized is that  if one could be content and happy with oneself , as I was during the later hours in Saturday and Sunday,  one could not be let down by other troubles in life.  I cannot ascertain that I have overcome my fears, but I definitely know that I would be able to handle my  ‘pinch of solitude’  successfully.

						   The art of being happy is the most difficult to master. Greed, which is quintessential nature of every person, places this art at the pinnacle. This is something many people might deny, though aware. Happiness is attainable, though the level may vary from person to person and time to time. Most of us are happy but would always reach out to be happier. We all treasure the happy moments of our life. When I write this down, I am making of treasure of happiness, which is priceless and which would be cherished.  Some time back, a question was put to me. This was the day I got my first job.   “Is this the happiest day of your life?”   “Yes!”   A month later I confronted another question. Now I had got my first salary.   “Was the last month the happiest period of your life?”  “No.”   “Why? This is all you dreamt of. This is for what you had your grilling sessions at college!”   I smiled and walked away.  Two years down the lane, I picked up a book   ‘ urlLink Five Point Someone ’   by   Chetan Bhagat  . I picked the book because on the cover, just below the title it was written  “What not to do at IIT!”  IIT was a dream destination for many of us who came into engineering. Being the person I am, I ended up at REC, Calicut; the best in Kerala. Vimal, a friend of mine from college, said the book was interesting. It was priced cheap (just Rs.95/-) so got a copy. I came back home and dropped it on my bed in my usual fashion. Roshan, who is my roommate, picked it up and by the time I came back from my usual night show sessions with Manoj he had finished the book! This was interesting and I took it the next day morning.  The next five hours was the best five hours I had in a long long time. As I started reading the book, the entire episodes of my life at REC unfolded one by one. The day I came into college for the first time, the intimidating speech from the Principal and HOD about the regulations, my first ragging sessions (though my seniors were kind and never bothered me), the first test in which I got (along with many of my classmates) a zero, all these came before me. I could feel the wave moving inside me. The three characters in the book Hari, Ryan and Alok were there in my campus, though with varying shades. The five pointers are the mediocre students that we could find in any college. They are never bad, as put forward by our heroes, they are the ones who maintain the balance! (I used to adorn the position, until when I reached the final year, when I had serious challenge to my position and was pushed up by my classmates. I ended up 2nd in class in my S8 interns!) My Profs, did not have beautiful daughter like Neha, with whom I could fall in love with, but I made a substitution with one other in the campus! Vodka parties on the top of the ‘insti’ were exactly like f-attic (the final year hostel). Tests and assignments were tackled by the unconditional ‘Cooperate to Dominate’ policy (one does and others make copies!). (Though, one incident that happened with us was that a friend photocopied an assignment and submitted it. When questioned he just answered, even if I write it would be the same thing!) I guess because Ryan did not play any instrument or IIT did not have a band, it was never mentioned in the book.   The book made me realize that my days at college were the best in my life. All that I ever did there is so much missed in my life. The author has done a superb job by narrating the life at college. I could feel myself in every frame of the story. Chetan presented me with happiness which would be cherished for ever.   Now that I am happy, the greed in me urges to be happier by going back to college!:-)

						   It is a common belief that sanity is the common denominator of a normal society. The attributes conferred to being sane are defined as the natural delimiters of social behavior. In this context an ‘option list’ is presented before any one who choose to be social, from which he could possibly opt those attributes with which he identifies himself the most. On a progressive scale, this starts from being a kid and would take him through his entire life, or may be till a stage in life where one finds himself above any and all of these confinements.  Most of us could see these pictures if they have the courage to make a time travel. My folks wanted me to pick just one chocolate at a party I attended when I was two. Then I was asked not to make shabby noise when in a crowd, had to keep time tables to study mathematics and history when I liked literature, had to do engineering when I preferred arts. I was told that I could not share a friendship with the some kids in my block, not to speak to my closest girlfriend for more than 10 minutes at a stretch, and the day I went out with her for lunch was a disaster. Once a grown up, these restrictions may not be imposed on by others, it would be self imposed. I might decide that I would just have a single plate of chicken at the buffet, or just limit to the first drink I take; and now with my wife and kids special care should be taken when dealing with ladies! :-)  I don’t wish to imply that this is/was the same with every person. But in one way or the other each one of us has had restrictions imposed on us. I even do not wish to say that all of the restrictions were bad. I just wanted to make a note that some of the restrictions make no sense under many circumstances.  One may not need any ESP to understand that this opinion would be criticized to a large extent and that many arguments may come against it. I would say that all of it could be explained by the attribute, ‘hypocrisy’. I have heard most of us say out loud that ‘one of the most cherished things in my life is the time I spend with myself.’ This statement could be rephrased as ‘I prefer my loneliness’. What I always felt is that loneliness is the most feared state of life by any person. I know a person who commented, “I’d rather die than be alone”. Another who would not dare to ogle a women or speak to one freely but dreams of sleeping with every good looking lady he ever saw, and many who say, “Work or no work, I need my breaks and vacations” and would spend night outs completing the next project.  Now coming back to the question of sanity, the fundamental definition of being insane is to act or behave in a way different from the majority of the crowd. Have you ever noticed that usually we also cross the fine line between being sane and insane? But we own a mind which would prudently return us to our original state and this ability of ours is what I call being sane.  We need one another to lead a healthy life. What is important is that we culture an ability to accept others as they are within ourselves. This would give us the ability to visualize an issue in many different perspectives which would help us identify the different attributes of our behavior. Once we get this figured out, the world would be a lot better to live in.    “Know yourself to live better.” :-)

						     This is a wonderful song by the band     Petra     . It says every thing I feel about love.          "Love is patient, love is kind       No eyes of envy, true love is blind       Love is humble, it knows no pride       No selfish motive hidden inside       Love is gentle, makes no demands       Despite all wrong, true love still stands       Love is holy, love is pure       It lasts forever, it will endure"               "Love knows when to let go       Love knows when to say no       Love grows in the light of the Son       And love shows the world that the Son of God has come"               "Love is loyal, believes the best       It loves the truth, love stands the test       Love is God sent in His Son       Love forgives all we have done"               "In this world where hatred seems to grow       True love goes against the flow       And becomes so hard to show"               "In this world where push turns to shove       We have strength to rise above       Through the power of His love       Lord, we need to know the power of your love"               "Love knows when to let go       Love knows when to say no       Love grows in the light of the Son       And love shows the world that the Son of God has come"

						       Last week I heard a wonderful message. The question put in front of me was “Why should one pray?” I have a post by the same title in this blog. It was strange that the same question should come in front of a person at different times and the answer that one finds should also be different! It is said that God is a loving father and that he showers blessings on us. He is omnipotent and nothing skips his vision. He knows our thoughts and our needs. If this is so, then why should I pray? He could just give it to me.         The answer came to me during the message. I remember the days in college when I used to go for internals with out any preparations. I would always be preoccupied with something, that I hardly find time to prepare for the test. I would write something from my memory. The tutor did a great job by putting together the words and getting me my sessionals. I never gave much importance to the out come, but was awarded with average internals. This continued till my final year. It was then that I met this awesome teacher who knew how to make me like the subject and taught me how to read the books with respect. That changed my life. I came closer to my studies and for the first time, I could actually go for an exam prepared. But the first time, I couldn’t do well. I was sad that day. He urged me to go on and the next time I scored a 100. I was so happy to see that my efforts gave results. I really valued it, unlike the days where I got the sessionals for granted.         This incident has always been on the back of my mind and the message I heard helped me in relating this with the question put in front of me. If God provides us with what ever we need, then we would fail to be thankful for the blessings. We would take it for granted and would misuse it. But when we long for a blessing and pray for it for day on end, then once we get it, it would have a different meaning. It would appear to be of ultimate value to us and we would make sure that it is used for the best.          God is a loving god and he would definitely provide us with what we need. Only if he is sure that we are worthy to receive it, that when he is sure that that gift is going to be safe with us.         Given below is an abstract of one of the speeches by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on God and Jesus. Please read on. It is absolutely marvelous.         Jesus and love are synonymous! If you say love, you need not say Jesus. If you say Jesus, that means love. Jesus said once, "If you call God in my name, if you ask God in my name, whatever you ask shall be given... For God is love." Such a complete expression of love is found in Jesus. Whatever little glimpses you may get here and there indicates that fullness, the ultimate expression of the inexpressible that life is striving to express throughout time.         You cannot understand the sayings of Jesus if you are not alive with  prana , with the life force. The knowledge will all be just a concept in the head. Only the heart can feel that heart.       Love goes with courage. Look at the courage Jesus had. He completely overthrows the common concepts of people such as the strong will inherit the earth. He turns it around, "The meek shall inherit the earth. The meek shall inherit heaven." For love makes you meek. However strong you are, when you are in love you are the weakest. Love is the strongest force in this universe and yet, it makes you meek... it makes you weak. Even a macho man will cry when he's in love. Love makes you weak, but brings you the kingdom of heaven.         Jesus says, "Love each other as much as I love you." It was impossible for someone not to recognize the love Jesus was, but since love makes you weak, it is also scary. Among thousands, just a few followed him. Many heard, but just a few came. That's why he says, "Many will come and hear, but only a few will understand. Very few shall pass through the narrow path."         Even after showing all those miracles, only a handful could recognize and follow Jesus. They were not high intellectuals but simple innocent people. When Jesus said, "the kingdom of heaven is within you", they did not understand. They said, "which side of God will you be sitting, the right or left?" Once you go within, there is no right or left! There is no front or back. Jesus' patience and compassion can only come out of love.         Very few understand what Jesus meant when he said: "I have put man against man, father against son, daughter against mother". Who you think are your friends are really not your friends because they make your faith in material things strong, and spirit less. "I have come to put one against each other. I've come to put fire, not make peace." If Jesus had to say this, it is because he has seen the depth of slumber in people! When you talk something nice and peaceful, everybody will go to sleep! When there is something sensational, people wake up and hear. Newspapers are filled with such stories! This is the human mind.         Jesus did all he could to help one cross the mind and get into the soul, the spirit, the source of life, the Self. You break through the limited concept of relating yourself with something, or somebody, or identities, and recognize the Divinity within you, that you are much more than just a human. You are part of the Divine and you will inherit the kingdom, which is right here, right within you.         Somewhere he has said, "It was better if Judas had not been born at all." Those words are not coming out of anger or frustration. Many times, when people don't like somebody, they say, "I wish they were never born." Here Jesus is saying, "Judas... I wish he was never born," because he could feel the pain that Judas was undergoing. Judas played the role that he was ordained to play. He had no choice! And Jesus could feel that pain, that suffering that Judas was undergoing.         At one point, in the end, Jesus says, "I am not yet one with my Father, but go and tell them that I am one with my Father." Scholars wonder why Jesus would tell such a lie. Also, that last moment when he said, "Forgive them, for they know not what they are doing." Or when he said, "Oh, my God, my Father, have you forsaken me?" That one idea at the last thought that, "God has forsaken me," kept the distance between "me and my Father". So Jesus said, "I am not yet one with my Father. I am at the doorstep of the house, but you tell the world I am already at home."                When someone is at home, it's much easier for them. When they're standing at the doorstep, waiting for the others - waiting in the rain, in the snow, in the storm, in the sun - that can only happen when there is so much love, so much compassion. Practically he is at home for the whole world.         The renowned sage Bodhisatva once said, "I'll stand at the door of heaven, till all the people go in. I'll be the last one to enter heaven. I'll wait at the doorstep." The same thing was true with Jesus. "I and my Father are one, say this to people."         You cannot understand the sayings of Jesus if you are not alive with prana, with the life force. The knowledge will all be just a concept in the head. Only the heart can feel that heart. Otherwise, in the name of Jesus, in the name of God, in the name of religion, people kill each other. In the name of God, many wars have happened. For centuries men have fought on this planet in the name of God, in the name of prophets, in the name of religion. They had no clue of Jesus.         When there is authority there cannot be love, and where there is love there is no authority. Jesus is opening his arms and saying, "Come, you are my friend, don't be afraid, don't put me on the altar. Give me a seat in your heart. See me in everyone you see around you. Love everyone as much as I love you... Or as much as you love me, share that with everyone around."         What more do you want to see in that embodiment of love? But people still wanted proof. If Jesus came today, he would still be asked, "Prove to me you are the son of God." So in those days too, he was asked to prove how he was the son of God, even after turning water into wine. This is because the mind dwells on proof. The mind cannot understand         Jesus, only the heart can feel the presence of Jesus.        Those who crucified Jesus were not bad people... they were ignorant. They were stuck in their head. They were not born out of spirit, but they had read all the scriptures and books. They thought he was being blasphemous, that he did something criminal.        Jesus never said, "I am suffering for your sin". That was just a way people used to awaken other people. The wise have many ways to lead one towards the truth and that was one of the ways. There are many things said like that, "Look, doomsday is coming, come on, wake up!" When Jesus was on this planet, those days were the darkest period. People were slaves; they were neither highly educated nor aware. It was necessary in those days to say, "Come on, wake up! There's going to be disaster!"         Fear wakes one up from slumber. Otherwise, one is doing the same thing, repeating the same thing and not open to knowledge. The teachers in those days knew this psychology. Fear need not be a tool for someone who is sensitive, but it works for someone who is thick-skinned.        Jesus himself has said that the Divine is in the present. "Your mind has been stolen by the past or the future. I am here to bring it to the present moment. I am the only way. If you cannot see the Divinity in me when I am right in front of you, do you think you are going to see the Divinity in the future or in the past?" Jesus leads you to your own Being, your own self, your own Divinity that is deep within you.         The spirit is eternal and beyond birth or death. Spirit is love beyond name and form. When you are truly in love with Jesus, you will see Jesus in every name, in every form, in every nook and corner of the planet and beyond. If you are just imagining Jesus as a form limited to a certain time of history and place, then your growth is also limited, because you are limiting Jesus. Of course, if a name or form is very appealing to you, you can have it as your personal master. Just go to the values that the Master truly represents and live them. Then he is not of the past, he is here now. And he will be in the future, also, forever and ever and ever.    This is the declaration of my faith.
