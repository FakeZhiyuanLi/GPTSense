						        I recently ran across this blog thing because I was dating a guy named Jason and I found his online blog. Needless to say, he was furious. But, my question is, why post something ONLINE, share it with a few select friends, but be mad at the guy you are seeing for finding it? I could have sat on it for days and waited to see what he posted about me, but that would have been out of my character. I told him the next day. My only understanding for him being upset is because I discovered that he still had feelings for someone in his hometown. He would post affectionate things about him, but I was always referred to as "My friend Chris." Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a little odd to be sleeping with me 3 days a week, having me move in a toothbrush(His idea), and saying that we are not seeing anyone else but each other, and then only refer to me as a friend in you blog? When we were supposedly only seeing each other, last I heard, that's what they called monogamous....But isn't it weird to be seeing only each other, then pass your # on a napkin to a waiter and referring to him as cute without telling this guy you're seeing? He said he only wanted to be friends. But I'm sorry...How am I supposed to believe that after all the red flags I asked about.      That's another thing. I think I'm pretty "on it." I recognize a red flag when I see one....But, when I ask...peolpe lie. Why is that??? What are they afraid of? Do they not think I'll find these things out eventually? I do photography and was playing with an editing program I have. I was using pics I took of Jason and I at the beach as examples. So, there were about 5 or 6 prints, 3 being the same pic with just trying different effects. My roommate and I were having company over, and as I was cleaning up the place, I saw the pics, and thought, hey...It would be nice to put some pics of Jason and I up since we're monogamous. So, I put 2 in a frame in my bathroom, and a 5x7 compilation above my desk. I had 2 sitting on the counter, but I put them on one of my photo bulletin boards just for the moment. Realizing only when Jason got there that I had 5 pics up of him....LOL You can imagine I was a bit embarrassed. My roomie pointed the pics out in a teasing manner, but I didn't really appreciate the toured attention he supplied. I explained to Jason and told him I was taking them down. He said not. to. He said he thought it was cute. I didn't believe this in my gut, so I asked him if he was sure, and he said definitely...I took them down after he left anyway. I told him I thought it was a bit much, and he still stuck with his "It's cute and sweet" story.       Well, when I found his blog the other day....It described me as having 3 "SHRINES" to him, and he described it as "Totally Creepy." ---WOW!      Again, maybe it's just me...but don't you think that when someone you are DATING asks you if something like that is odd, you should TELL THE TRUTH!?!? And, oh, yes. Of course I"M in the wrong for reading the blog he shares with his friends. Sorry, but what the F@%K is that???      So, yeah To rewind before the blog...while we were monogamous, he called me one day and asked if I was awake yet. I told him I would wake up in an hour or so, and he said to call him when I woke up. I woke up earlier and forgot to call him. I went on Gay.com to see if he was on, and sure enough he was. His pic was updated with one I had taken of him at the beach, but he didn't seem to remember to update his "single" status. I wasn't asking for it to say married, but I thought the "Seeing someone special" option would have been appropriate. So, in the time he was so excited to update his pic on 4 sites, he never remembered to change his status on either of them. Anyway...... He was on gay.com not knowing I was, and his bio line said "24 y/o. Bored at home. Looking for cool guys to hang out with. Have pic."      Now, again...Am I crazy!?!? Yes, sure he could have been only looking for friends. He said he chatted on there only to talk to his friends who only had gay.com profiles and no other messengers. Hmmm.....This after a saying how he couldn't believe that my roommate would meet someone offline that he didn't know. That to me spelled hypocritical. He said he didn't realize that his bioline said that, and it didn't mean anything bad, but sorry.....No go. I broke it off with him completely.       Then, he called a few days later saying he missed me. I wasn't even going to give him the time of day, but we chatted for 2.5 hours. He seemed very honest. He wanted to be monogamous again, and I told him that we had to start from scratch as friends first. We both made the mistake of being committed out of fear of the other doing something, and that's not a good reason to do so.      Everything was WONDERFUL.......He was AMAZING. He printed out the pics we took at the beach and framed them for me as my Bday gift, and he even made my bday cake.......HOW SWEET IS THAT!?!? I wanted to melt, and thought things were finally going well.       Later that night, he corrected a typo on one of his AIM handles on my computer. I thought I'd see if he had a web page under the correct handle. I think that's normal. You want to know more about a person, so you look at their profile, etc. Well, he had friends linked by it, and I thought I would look at their pages to be able to put a face to a name when he told me stories of people back home as he would. Well one of them had a link back to Jason, but this however was directly to his blog. I thought...Okay, if his friend has this linked, and Jason's page itself even mentioned the blog saying that he shares it with his friends...Surely he wouldn't care if the guy he was seeing(me) read some. I mean come on...show your friends, but I'm not supposed to read it? HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW!?!?!? If it were a book journal I found in his room...Hello, NEVER would I read that!!!! I read it as described above, and told him right afterward, he turned it all around and now somehow this is all my fault.....So, I ask you....Why do people do the things they do?       I posted a comment on his blog. Almost regretting pointing out that we were together for his friends to see. He says only he reads it, obviously not true.Why did he feel he had to hide me? Was I just a backup to the guy back home? Why couldn't he be honest with me about his feelings? And, why the heck does part of me STILL want to try to make things work? Even though I have exposed him for my eyes, does that mean he'll change? I don't think people do. I hurt him not meaning to. I wish he would have been real. I wish the way he acted in front of me was the way he felt while he was away as well. I'm upset. I'm furious and at the same time I feel so sad. I know I'm stronger than to put up with shit like this. It's just the battered wife syndrome though. Part of me wishes everything would be okay with him. I like him. Argh....After all of this crap, a little part of me wants to make sure that he is okay. I want to protect him. I think people do stupid things out of fear. I don't want him to be afraid...I want him to be the man that inside I know he wants to be, and maybe he thinks he already is.       I don't know if I can believe him now. But, I do believe in him.

						   Just got off the phone with Jason. We've gone back and forth over these couple months. Mainly for a trust issue. I found myself the other day letting my walls down. Exposing my heart in a way that I know he is too afraid to do. I jumped. And, watching me and seeing that it was okay, he just stood there. He didn't jump. He used humor, he used work, he used time. He used any excuse that would allow him to avoid the real issue. I knw he thinks it's always another issue with me. But, it has only really been one...Does he really want to be with me?  No, unfortunately not.  He will be happy. He'll find someone that impresses him. We all do. Everyone moves on in a situation like this, as I'm sure I will. I wonder if he thinks I will still be there, waiting. He doesn't take me seriously. He thinks that when I jump, it is much easier for me. But, he doesn't understand that I still feel all the fear he does when he thinks about exposing himself to someone.  It's not easier. I'm just braver. And, I fight for what I believe in.  You know how you trick your mind sometimes to believe you may like someone? Yeah, I've done that. I thought about this situation possably being such. But, there was something inside of me that knew better. I knew that if he would have taken the chance that he said he wanted, it could have worked.  I don't say things unless I am absolutely confident about how I feel. I asked to be together, he gave me the usual avoidance, and after 2 days of waiting, he said it was what he wanted, but he doesn't know. He knows. No one doesn't know about something like that. I finally had to tell him that his own answer was no. I could have waited, but I deserve more. A schedule doesn't matter when you're with someone. But, I am too forward with him. He doesn't like the confrontation. It makes him uneasy.  There is a wonderful guy in there I call "The 75% man." I call it that because it's how he is 75% of the time when we are ALONE.&nbsp; But, the other 25% of the time he is "Lawyer man." You know the ones. They are always making themselves out to be the victim saying that you are accusing them of something anytime you ask them a question. I like the 75% man. He hates the terms. I think it's because it almost labels him as being&nbsp; 75% likable. I know that guy is 99% him. But, from one person or another coming by and breaking his trust or heart, he he has the "Lawyer man" fascade as a result of a slight bitter jadedness.  I'm not afraid to say what I feel I know.&nbsp; I know if he was the person he was a year or 2 ago, he would have let me in. I know that he wanted to. I know these thoughts aren't far-fetched because of what he has told me. I know my heart wants to break, but I can't let it this time. I know it is because he is afraid. Much past that, I'm not sure. But, I thought these songs were in order...  &nbsp;   Tori Amos  Winter

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Been a while since my last blog. I wrote another long one a couple of weeks ago, and in the midst of trying to spell check, it got deleted. That's the thing about a blog. You can't respit things quite the same way. It's more of a release, and it typing it all over again would be like asking someone to throw up a meal that looks like it was never touched. Hmmm...gross comparison.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, of course as usual, a lot has happened. I'm MUCH busier lately. I started my actor's forum last week. It was very successful. We continued with our meeting today. It is something I formed for other actors to get together and critique each other. This way no one is being ripped of by a class that is just stringing them along. Here, we're brutal. If you're producing crap, we're not afraid to stop you in the middle and rip you a new a-hole. So far the response has been very accepted. But, I'm waiting for a few weeks when people start feeling personally attacked, and there are tears. It will happen. I'm just hoping everyone handles it as well as they say they will.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romantically, I have healed. I think. LOL How do you ever really know? I met a guy named Edward at a 4th of July party I went to. He was very much my type physically. We hung out for a few days, and I started to notice that he was more analytical than what I liked. It was great for him because he thought about a lot of things most people wouldn't, and that I'm sure, made him a better person all around. I am all about anyone telling me at anytime what they think of me. I take in opinions, and I seriously consider everyone's input. But, I don't like it when someone &nbsp;as opposed to saying, "I think you are....." They instead say, "You are...". It's okay to give someone an opinion of how you interpret them, but it is another to try to tell them who they are. I used to hate when I was 16 and people would say, you'll understand when you're 18, or 21. Those ages came, and you know what, I had the right grasp on the concepts early on. I think people are just threatened when other people grasp things earlier than they do. Oops, didn't mean to go on about that. LOL  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, anyway, Edward is this really wonderful guy. He would do almost anything for his friends, but I think he's still putting the finl touches on the masterpiece he's made of his life. We're going to be good friends....and coworkers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tanning salon was being VERY flakey. Calling me off more than I would actually work. And, the people there didn't exactly know their stuff. It's pretty bad when you have to look at the new guy to explain things to a client. After telling Edward about this, he suggested working with him at a hair salon in Beverly Hills called "Jonathan". I refused a few times because I wanted to be loyal to the tanning salon, but he insisted. And, I'm glad he did.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went in to interview, and keeping in mind this is an elite salon where a hair cut can set you back $400, I was a bit concerned about my complete lack of salon experience. Thank goodness I've been doing mine and friend's hair for 10 years now. I went home thinking I may not have got it, but was called later that day and I was working a couple days later. I worked 5 days in a row. MORE happy at this job than a few in a while. I wa actually a bit nervous as to what was expected of me, but I caught on. I am an assistant to the stylists there. I mainly do shampoos, and make sure guests are taken care of. Anything the&nbsp;stylists need; dryers, &nbsp;trays, color, I grab it for them. It kind of sounds menial. But, I'm just so happy to be working with really fun people that I can just joke around with, and seeing the same faces is really nice. I've missed going into work and not having the atmosphere and people change all the time. Daniel, one of the stylists, gave me a cut the first day. He styled it into an off center man-hawk. Hehe, it was very fun. It's not the typical thing I would do. I've never been allowed to with doing the acting thing. But, it is still stylable in a conservative sense. Alicia is going to do my color on Wednesday. It will be nice to get this stuff done by people I can trust. And the real topper is that they aren't charging me. How wonderful are they?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be working there 3 days a week. I found out that I am actually on salary. And, when I asked about a schedule, they made one up for me that only ha me working 5-7 hours a day as opposed to the 12 hour days I was happily putting in before. But even with the hour decrease, I still get the same salary. Hecks yeah! Plus tips!!!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, yeah. My life may be able to be in order now. : ) The salon really saved me from a lot of worrying. There are still plenty of things I need to get caught up on. The cell phone still needs to be paid, and my car is doing more new fun things. But, at least I have a sense that I can be okay. I can afford my rent, and if I can get some photo shoots in, then I will be okay. : ) It's a nice feeling.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Jason, if you're reading this...yeah, I still think of you. I wanted to come over, ring the buzzer, and just crawl in bed and hold you. But, that was at 4am. I'm happy. I'm here, and I finally have a sense of what I am doing. It's nice when you know yourself. But, it's great when you also know where you're going. : )

						        So, as I'm typing, Hoobastank "The Reason" came on the Yahoo Messenger radio. When I broke it off with Jason the first time and we went back to talking, we decided there was a trust issue on both parts. I think we were both afraid of the other going somewhere else. I'm the kind of person that would break something off before I would go to someone else. But, he was afraid of my stripper, etc. past. I'm not a stripper or anything like that at all anymore. I changed my life for the better for me. But, I wanted to let him know that just him being there was encouragement and gave me a reason to keep my life going that way I want. That's why I When we started talking again, the first time...that I Put "The Reason" the song, on a CD for him, and came over with it. I meant to leave it on his car or doorstep, btu I forgot that L.A. isn't as trusting as the midwest and that I'm not the kind of crazy person to hop a fence for the cause. LOL So, instead, I called him, and he let me in. It was late, so I stayed over. He listened to it in the morning. The note and lyrics I included were placed front and center on his entertainment center. They are still there as far as I know. It's the same place he put a baloon animal poodle I made for fun in the car together when we first met. LOL It was there until it was an unidentifiable miniature poodle. I didn't think he would put that stuff there, but, it made me feel special.       Anyway, I express myself through music a lot. Music makes you feel more than just the words. It has the rock beat that can make you feel cheesy and happy, and the violins that often cry with you. That's why I am deciding to have a song of the day. Sporatically placed, any tune or partial tune I put in here will be able to tell you how I'm feeling, or what I'm thinking about that day. I came here to post one, but I think that I will put the other that I spoke about up as well. Even if you don't know them, I hope you enjoy:   "THE REASON" By: Hoobastank I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you   Another I thought was appropriate.....   "MORE LOVE" By: The Dixie Chicks  I'm so close to you baby But I'm so far away There's a silence between us And there's so much to say You're my strength, you're my weakness You're my faith, you're my doubt We gotta meet in the middle To work this thing out  More love, I can hear our hearts cryin' More love, I know that's all we need More love, to flow in between us To take us and hold us and lift us above If there's ever an answer It's more love  We're afraid to be idle So we fill up the days We run on the treadmill Keep slavin' away 'til there's no time for talkin' About trouble in mind And the doors are all closed Between your heart and mine  More love, I can hear our hearts cryin' More love, I know that's all we need More love, to flow in between us To take us and hold us and lift us above If there's ever an answer It's more love  Just look out around us People fightin' their wars They think they'll be happy When they've settled their scores Let's lay down our weapons That hold us apart Be still for just a minute Try to open our hearts  More love, I can hear our hearts cryin' More love, I know that's all we need More love, to flow in between us To take us and hold us and lift us above If there's ever an answer It's more love  I can hear our hearts cryin' More love, I know that's all we need More love, to flow in between us To take us and hold us and lift us above If there's ever an answer It's more love        So, Jason and I are communicating. He text messaged me today wishing me luck on my new tanning job. I don't think that love is the right word, but I think we needed more something. But, I'm glad that we are talking now. He's important to me. He's hit something good. Don't worry, I do have a life and not all my posts will be obsessively about him. :) But, my life is changing again, and he is on my mind.       In other news.... :)       I started my job last night. IT ROCKS!!! I notice that a lot of people out here who work at tanning beds don't really get tan. What's up with that!?!? I'm ALL about the tan. It's fake n' bake, and I help! I have a lot of medical tanning knowledge...Yes, there is a medical side to it. hehe Well, it was kewl that I got to share what I knew and such. She handed me some training sheets of info. I looked at it for about 5 seconds and pointed out an error. LOL I think it makes everyone feel good when they get to put some knowledge to use. She said she wanted me to try all the beds. I'm like....Uh...Hecks yeah! Hehe. I went tanning yesterday and today. I think it'll help me get back to my old self. : )      I went to the ortho yesterday and did my new molds. It was cute...there is a guy there that always flirts with me. I'm not attracted to him like that, but I was flatterred.       I'm going out with Emiliano tonight. Don't know what we'll do, but it should be fun. He's here waiting for me to get done typing, so I better take off. More in the future as always.

						        I got a call about an hour after my last post. Yep, Jason. He asked if we were still mad at each other. I wanted to come up with some swift comment, but instead I just asked him if he thought we were. He wanted to talk, and I agreed to go over there. I brought his hat a baking sheet from the cake he made back to him expecting that I may never get another chance to return it other than leaving it on his doorstep.       I got there and we started the usual avoidance talk; talking about his new job, etc. We finally got on the subject. I didn't need a reconciliation, just for him to understand where I was coming from and to hopefully get him to be completely honest with me about everything. I didn't know it was so much to ask. I had him read the comment I posted on his blog, and this blog itself. I thought that was the best way for him to understand. We started talking about all of this. He admitted that he didn't want to share everything with someone because he didn't want to bother them with his problems. I explained that when you're in a relationship your problems are each others, and it's better because you have 2 heads working together. Everything was going well for about 2 hours. I thought we were going to mend things up and at least be able to have a real functional friendship out of the deal. But, toward the end of the night he got defensive again. He still doesn't say that he was hitting on the waiter. Whenever I would ask his something specific like that, he would refuse to give me a direct answer and acted like he was being personally attacked. I asked him to pretend he was in my shoes, and that upset him even more. He said I was asking him to think of something too hypothetical. I just wanted him to admit the truth....that if he were in my shoes, he would have thought the exact same thing. If I would have posted a bio line like he had, if I had posted something about giving my # to a cute waiter while we were monogamous, if I had an updated manhunt profile like he did at the same time. He said I was holding this against him. LOL Well, hello! If he would tell me the truth there would be nothing to hold against him. I would just deal with it. He said he was on Manhunt for the same reason he gets on friendster. What!?!? I'm supposed to believe that!?!? I asked why....He said nothing came of it....I said, no why???...He said he only got posts from old men wanting sex....I said again...No...Why Did you post then?...Same as why he posted on friendster. Then, he said he took it down anyway. I said, yes true. But he took it down the day after I told him I found it. Sorry you don't get a special cookie for being prompted to do something.      So, he got defensive again. I was trying to share some more things about me to promote an honest atmosphere, but he choked up and was afraid to tell me the truth or something. He used the famous defense mechanism of turning things around, avoiding answering questions, and closing up. I had to just say that I couldn't make him be honest, I can't make him that person, and told him to have fun. I had to walk out.      There is nothing I can do for someone who won't be honest. Nothing. I could say what I wish or want, but at this point, it's no use. It's not in my hands, and nothing I can say now will change anything.       In other news....Yeah, I have other things to talk about believe it or not. LOL...      I have an ortho appointment today. I have had these invisalighn braces now for 2 years. It was only supposed to be a year, but I got behind on payments. With having to pay $5,000.00 in one year on top of other bills, who could blame me. Then, I went to MI for 6 months, and the process was drawn out more. Now, they don't fit perfect according to my ortho, which I guess is good for him to point out. But, I had to get new impressions and a new set. I waited another 2 months and called to see if the new braces came in yet, and they said they lost my contact info, and they have to take even MORE impressions. Oy Vay! So, we'll try it again.      I also start my new job at the tanning bed today. THAT took forever. I was supposed to start 2 weeks ago, but the gal there got sick or something and wasn't great at getting back to me on time. So, I had to call like crazy, and now start today. :) I'm excited...I LOVE tanning! hehe. Anyway, that's all today. Here's to trying to put my best face on and tell people..."Yeah I'm okay." It only hurts when I breathe.

						   Hey, that seemed like a fun enough title. SOOOO much goin' on right now I don't know if I'm coming or going. I put in my 2 weeks notice at the hair salon last weekend. Too much 5th grade stuff. lol I'm the kind of guy where either you talk directly to someone when you have a problem, or I come directly to you and see how tough your skin is. I just don't see the point of talking behind people's back. Oh well. It all got straightened out. I'm an assistant there, where many of the stylists start. And, I don't think they knew that I have no desire to be a stylist. So, to them I was low man on the totem pole who had to hold his tongue and pay his dues. lol Yeah, not so much. I'm a little to real to play the 5th grade games. But, it's all good. At least some people got a lesson in humanity. ; ) My last day there is Friday the 13th. Oooo Freaky!!!  I just had a photo client stop by for a consultation. I don't know that I'll be able to make her happy. lol I don't know if anyone can because she has no idea what she wants. She had some photos that were less than desirable someone else took. I know I can take good photos of her, I just don't know if it will be what she wants. lol She needs to decide and tell me for sure. hehe  Lalalalalala.............  I'm in one of those fun moods. Listening to Robyn. You know that kewl white chick that sounds like a black ghetto gal from the 90's. She can sing though. I like it!  So, my Actor's Forum is all kinds of ROCKIN' OUT!!! Everyone is really stickin' with it and doing the work. A few of us from the forum went to the beach last night until 1:30am. We watched "Riding in Cars with Boys" on my portable DVD player. It was kewl. The waves were right there. lol The tide came in and almost drenched us. Luckily Brent saw, and grabbed the player before it got wet. We were smart and moved back. There were so many people at the beach. I was really surprised. Derris brought some wine....lol he is a fun guy. Very mellow yet opinionated. He's cool though because he's always up for doing something. I think that rocks!  I'm goin' through another switch here. Getting more straight friends, looking for a new place, and a new job. It usually really bothers me to do so, but I don't really feel any negative effects. I have a handful of change to my name at the moment, but I'm happy. : ) I LOVE THAT!!!
