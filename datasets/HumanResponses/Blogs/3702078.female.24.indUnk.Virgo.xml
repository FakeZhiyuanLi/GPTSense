      i thought i'd take this opportunity to share a bit of south african history...  wednesday, the 16th, was national youth day here in south africa.  the day  celebrates june 16th, 1976, when student uprisings began in soweto. i've mentioned soweto a number of times - it's actually a group of townships  southwest of johannesburg (hence the name: SoWeTo stands for south-west  townships).  the township these days is a mix of extreme poverty and extremely  wealthy black families (winnie mandela, nelson mandela's former wife, has a  house in one of the neighborhoods), but is famous historically for its  political activism - desmond tutu and nelson mandela, for example, both grew up  there.   in any case, during the apartheid era, blacks (and coloreds, as i've mentioned  before) were confined to townships outside of the almost exclusively white  cities and forced into a 'bantu education system,' where they were made to  study in afrikaans, and in which their own history was given no regard at all. june 16th, 1976 was the beginning of the end of the educational system and  ultimately apartheid - students and young people took to the streets  demonstrating against the forced educational system and disregard for their own  culture and history.   these days anyone  visiting soweto will be taken to the hector peterson memorial/museum - a shrine  to the first casualty of the uprisings and one of the three subjects of an  internationally famous photo of him being carried by his sister and a friend to  a nearby church for help (the church, incidentally, is the one where my boss'  father preached).  peterson was the first among many killed on june 16th for  publically demonstrating against bantu education and the system of repression  practiced by the apartheid regime. the amazing thing is how fresh this history all is  here - even more so than i've experienced in israel, which still only  celebrated its 56th independence day this year.  here so much of apartheid  still lingers on in mentalities that these celebrations are fierce  demonstrations of how much things still need to change, as much as they  celebrate how much things already have and south africa's ability to make a  peaceful transition from one of the most racist political systems on earth to  one of the world's most participatory democracies.    speaking of transition/democracy/peace and justice... a few minutes after i hit 'send' on last week's email, i was called into  my 'orientation' meeting with the office director.  i should have had this  meeting last monday when i arrived, but since another intern was arriving that  morning, ivor (the office director) put it off until he was around as well.   the meeting was basically administrative, but ivor began by discussing a bit  what it means to be an american in south africa.  in particular he was talking  about the anti-americanism in this country, or rather anti-bush administration- ism.  the key point, he said, is that south africans feel that if ever an  internal war (civil war, i suppose) were justified, it was justified in south  africa - - and that south africans very very strongly feel that if they were  able to resolve such deep-rooted problems without resorting to warfare, the  rest of the world should be able to, as well. hence the nearly universal  opposition here to the war in iraq, hence strong anti-israeli feelings  (although i have to say i personally haven't felt any less comfortable  introducing myself to people as an israeli than as an american).  hey, that's what i am here for, right? to learn about how south africa has  managed to resolve some of its deep-seated problems, and take some of those  approaches and adapt them to the conflict region i'm from and conflict regions  where other methods haven't worked...and get there before the situation  disintegrates to another iraq, or another kosovo, or another haiti.    an interesting point ivor made about the anti-americanism is that south  africans right now are distinguishing between american citizens and the bush  administration...but that if bush is re-elected in november, things may change  as the perception will be that americans supported bush overall.    i was thinking about these things as i went sight-seeing in pretoria this  weekend (actually, sight-seeing was second priority to seeing the south african  musical 'sarafina,' but unfortunately my pals and i didn't buy our tickets  early enough and it sold out.  i guess even some things here don't quite fit  into the 'african time' concept...). in any case, i spent yesterday afternoon walking through historical pretoria -  in particular, the union buildings (seat of government) and church square (home  to the provincial supreme court and other various municipal buildings). i have to say i was thoroughly unimpressed with both places.  sure, the  architecture is gorgeous, and the grounds of the union buildings are immaculate  and full of flowers...but they seem to have no soul.  maybe it's because the  opulence of the union buildings and surrounding gardens stands uncomfortably  juxtaposed with the slightly seedy downtown areas right near it...but more  likely, i think, is because of what these buildings represent: a racist,  xenophobic regime whose day has long passed.  true, the union buildings are  still the seat of government (and the scene of this year's 10-year anniversary  of "the new south africa") and the buildings in church square are still used  for various civic functions, but their grandeur is a reminder of what south  africa used to be - nelson mandela was tried in the palace of justice, where  the supreme court now sits, and the apartheid policies were carefully designed  where mbeke now sits as president of the republic.  a statue of paul kruger -  one of the early and most vehement leaders of apartheid - still stands at the  center of church square.   so yes, i'm glad i visited - - but the splendor of the two areas is marred for  me.  i certainly don't feel a need to return (although, there is a nice little  crafts market near the union buildings...i may have to return for some gifts!)  continuing on the political note... i forgot to mention that last weekend (saturday, the 12th) the olympic torch  came through south africa - capetown, specifically. this is the first time  south africa was a site in which the torch was carried, and it was a very, very  big deal.  torch carriers and runners ranged the gamit from politicians to  political activists to celebrated atheletes and community members.  nelson  mandela held the torch on robben island, where he was imprisoned for over 20  years.  the torch was there only from about 7AM until late afternoon, but  advertisements on television for the entire week preceding demonstrated the  poignance and momentousness of this occasion - another indicator of just how  far south africa has come from its history of apartheid and isolation from  international support.   on the opposite end was political coverage of ronald reagan's funeral.  reagan  is viewed here very negatively for his interactions with the apartheid regime,  and it took a few days for thembo mbeke (south africa's president) to say  anything positive about him - despite the fact that the decision to extend  mbeke's sojourn in DC (he was there for the G8 summit) so that he could attend  the funeral was made as soon as reagan's death became public information.   overall here press coverage of the incident was definitely on the negative  side, even from the more conservative news channels.     but, enough of history and politics for now. my sojourn here so far has been  shaped by all kinds of 'south africa moments' and experiences...  just as one example: as i walked over to a nearby shopping complex saturday  morning to buy a converter a man was sitting outside singing and hoping that  passer-byes would fill his cup with change.  no different, one might say, from  street musicians anywhere in the world.  the difference was, he was singing  christmas hymns in zulu. it's an indication of how large a role religion plays  in this country - politically as well as personally as well as economically.   and a truly south african moment.      and as an update to my falling-in-love-at-first-sight experience last week:  when i left my flat yesterday to go buy some groceries, the guy selling  newspapers on the corner was there yet again...and as i passed by, he smiled  flirtatiously, said good-morning and called me by name. at first i was amazed that he remembered me - after all, despite professing his  love, he really did only see me once, for five minutes, a week before - and was  a bit angry at myself for not remembering his (romantic interest or not, i felt  i was being rude in some ways by not taking the trouble to remember it).  but  after a few minutes i realized that really, recalling what MY name is and who i  am is almost to be expected - after all, as a white person - and more  specifically, as a petite, brown-haired white woman - i certainly stand out in  my predominantly black neighborhood.   with this came the additional realization that this is the probably the first  time in my life i've lived somewhere where i am visibly in the minority.  it's  hard to realize how easy it is to take majority status for granted, even when  i'm conscious of it.   so in that sense south africa is becoming as much of a learning experience  about myself as it is about the culture, history, and traditions here...  that's it for today - - karen's monday morning (well, afternoon) philosophical  waxing.  have a wonderful summer (winter) solstice everyone - - i know i'm  looking forward to the start of longer days in this part of the world!  much love, karen
