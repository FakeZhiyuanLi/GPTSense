        You are his... Hypnotic/Intrigued Stare. A lot of things easily amuse you, so you tend to get distracted quickly. I call this a gift, especially since I need something to entertain me during school! ^_~    urlLink   Which Facial Expression of Jack Sparrow's Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Wheeeeeeeee!

      Am tired. Got acquainted with nice girl lately while on Subby forum. Let's call her Neko. Neko's younger than me, but fun to chat with. Some people become annoying when you chat with them. Like Martin - and if you're reading this, Marty, know that I'm more tired than pissed - who just started chatting. We chatted about senseless stuff, which is amusing, but in this case just flat. Then he just out of no where says bye - while I always regret having to go - as in he's bored... insulting. I told him I'm pissed though and that I might not talk to him for a while - he wondered if that was a good or bad thing. Annoying prat. I need sleep.  In other news, decided to go for written driving test (for permit) Thursday. *grunts* I have to go, otherwise my mom will have to drive me to University. -_-  Too tired to think. Will post later.  ...I want a bunny, but not a pink one.

      French exam went smoothly (but oh so boringly), and I received my last biology test (on which I got only 90% - oh the drama!). Got major cramps in horseback riding that night, because of period (which always start at the worse times methinks).  Next day, went to see kittens at my cousin's place, swam around in his pool. Went to little sister's 8th grade graduation and to the dance - which was boring, so we left early.  Went bicycling with my friend on Friday to get my order from Sears. Pink scooter (I still think pink is evil, I just don't wear enough and that shade was okay) is what I bought - it's shorts but with a skirt on top (so it's comfortable and pretty). On the way we stopped to school to talk with the Principal.  Decided to work on yearbook again next year, but my best friend will be coordinator (am a little pissed. She always steals the spotlight.) and so will only take 6 courses instead of 7 (she had to discuss those matters with the Principal).  Slept over at friend's house (watched Catch that Kid and The Paycheck), went swimming at her sister's house then came back home to call my dad. He came to get me, and I discovered he'd bought... a mac G5!! Total secret, must not be leaked out because my mom always asks for more money, and if she knew she'd think my dad has plenty and ask for even more.  Slept over, helped cleaning up house and making diner because of Father's Day. Dad tried to convince me (again) that I should be a doctor. Pointed out I didn't take Physics (just for him to get off my back, btw) and that I still planned to become a psy. Little sisters came back from out cottage at 8, went out to Kentucky's to eat.   Daddy said he'd give us 230$ for me to help my sister - let's name her Evil - for her summer courses in math. Evil decided she wanted a bow. Am v. suspicious of her intentions. Also said she wanted a go kart. Pointed out we didn't have a track. Bow+go kart? I'll have to analyze this case further...

      Dance!   (>^.^)> ...I'm obssessed with that dancing kirby ever since I saw it as an animation.  Anyway, I'm cold. I should probably put my shirt back on (it's an habit of mine, to walk around the house shirtless). Or turn off the fan.  Biology exam went okay - boring short answers questions. And no, I didn't study. I won't study for tomorrow's French exam either (...well, I should remember the play and book we read. Oh, grammar be damned. We're allowed a dictionary anyway... -_- ) Anyway, tonight I have horseback riding, so I'll be gone from 5:00-9:00. I'm going to accept their summer camp job proposal. I'm happy. ^^ I have to practice my circles. :P Even though I'd rather do jumping. Talking of horses, I didn't mention that I got one for my birthday (December 24th) two years ago, uh? His name's Shadow, two years-old gelding (Appaloosa/Quarter Horse mix). I wuv him loads even though I don't see him often since he lives in Quebec (see, my parents divorced and I was supposed to move with my dad but decided against it). He's beautiful - I'll try scanning a picture later if I can (...see the post about cutting my head off - my computer crashed and stuff).  I had a nice msn talk with Ricky last night - he was the one who made me take the test below this entry - and we're supposed to chat again tonight. It makes me happy... I need happiness. And glomps. Gimme glomps! And lollipops...

      Physics exam went horribly. XD First part, I got one third of multiple choices questions wrong (the teacher told me)... second part, I invented something for a question (equation derivation) and tried out stuff for two other questions which I'm sure aren't the answer. So half of the second part went bad. :P The last part was comprehension, explanations - did well for two, the other I'm not sure (I invented a bit... or rather, hoped it was true) blah.. But, I don't care. ^^;; I didn't care last night, then a little voice in my head at 1 a.m. told me: What if you fail? You might fail the course! and I was so scared I revised a while (but it didn't help... hn). And during the exam I didn't care much, and at the end I was like 'fuck it'. Erm. And I didn't use my cheat sheet at all. *shakes head* I never do... -_-   Anyway, biology exam tomorrow, for which I'm happy. Biology is fun 'n easy. Then French - boring, but also easy.  All I had in mind during the last few days, actually, is the Sublunary rp in which I participate. I invented and rp Kano, a vampire 104 years-old, with raven hair and red eyes... and pierced nipples. I wuv him. And I wuv Sekai (Kano wuvs him too ^_- ), the Aquilli (bird-boy... more like an angel with pointed ears, actually. He's got lots of rings and tattoos. *wheees*), I just wuv the pic Rei drew of him! ^^  Oh, and I'm going to accept the job offer at the stables. I don't want to be cashier or anything, and I'd need flexible hours in order to continue my riding lessons and being free to baby-sit. So, I'll sell my family's maple syrup during the summer, babysit when I'm needed, and be a camp monitor for two weeks. Sounds fun. ^^

      Back from Chemistry test. Did some stupid mistakes, lab was okay, some of my calculations made no sense. Still, I'm sure I'll get at least 75%. Of course, I probably shouldn't trust my intuition. -_-  Since I've gotten back from school (at 12:30), I've eaten, ran around, posted on the Sublunary forum, ran around, drew (a chibi Yuushi - one of the characters of Subby), and (now) posted on my journal.  Now, it's time to scream (and perhaps cut my head off to stuff it with cotton), since Physics exam is tomorrow. I figured I shouldn't care what note I get, because I'm not taking the subject next year. And even if I get a C, my final note will be a B. Hn.  Anyway, I'll study when I'm back from babysitting. *grumbles* Ah yes... money-wise, should I get a job? I mean, I might be needed for babysitting, but that's not that much money. And I got a job offer at the stables I ride at, but only for the summer camps - two weeks - and my mom would have to bring me there. On account that I can't drive yet... *coughs* I have to pass my basic driving test first.

      Anyway, so I came back from the movies and shopping at 12:30 this morning, but I didn't get to bed until two hours later - I just had to rp!   When I first saw Harry Potter, I thought the others were better. But now that's I've seen it again, I really like that one better. I just don't like the changes the director has made (like calling Dumbledore 'Headmaster' all the time, changing the grounds and positions of things like the Gryffindow common room, making the students wear normal clothing most of the time). There wasn't enough Quidditch, and the lightning part was ridiculus. Also, Dementors don't fly!! >.  It didn't give justice to the book, but as a movie it's really great (the humour is greater, even though the movie is darker). ...Draco's a great bitch too...

      I'm feeling murderous (towards my computer and myself, I guess). I was going to scan a drawing I made of Kano (my vampire character I use to roleplay on the Sublunary forum. BTW, Sublunary is a great yaoi manga hosted on keenspace!) When I was saving the scan to my folders, the program froze, so I tried to get a reaction out of my computer, so I selected 'empty the trash'. Is there any way that by selecting that, I could have deleted my folders??  All the stuff on the desktop is gone (and other stuff like msn, but I just downloaded it again), as well as everything in my folders. INCLUDING MY ART AND STORIES! I'm utterly pissed. Hope there's a way to fix that, or I might just cut my head off and stuff it with cotton.  *grumbles* In other news, I'm going out with some friends tonight to shop and see Harry Potter (I'm seeing it again, wheee).

      The end of school, that is!! If I don't take the next week's exams in consideration...  This year, all the exams are at 9 in the morning... so much for studying beforehand. I decided to drop one science next year.  So, my exams schedule is :  Monday: Chemistry (lab and written... we'll see how that works out...)  Note before exam: between 79-85% Tuesday: Physics (damned physics will kill me - so I drop them)   Note before exam: between 79-85% Wednesday: Biology (easy, easy, I knew everything we learned...)  Note before exam: between 90-95% Thursday: French (I'm the best in French. bwaha. ha. ha.)  Note before exam: between 85-90%                         *I'm only guessing my notes before exam, taking in considerating all my tests...  Did I mention I slept only 4 hours last night (I mean, this morning)? I had to do a physics 'cheat-sheet', a sheet on which you write whatever you like (notes), allowed on the exam. I always wait til the last minute. Physics is the only exam which worries me (my note is only this high because I did well lately... I really need to study the previous chapters...).  The end of school, the beginning of studying.

      It's my little sister's eleventh birthday today, so I'm eating a piece of chocolate cake - hence the title.  I've decided to register and post entries just to see if people would comment. And rant. A LOT. I guess I'll also post things I write or draw.  Honestly, I don't see why anyone would be interested in my life, but anyway - I have to finish my cake, and will post later.  (If I seem dull, it's because I haven't slept more than 6 hours in the last month... and now I should be doing homework).

      Back to my normal, happy mood.   Also been reading Garou, a GW fanfic in which some of the boys become werewolves! Nice twist, a little too OOC for my taste, but amusing. Shounen-ai!   So, Wednesday I'll be leaving to Quebec with my little sisters; it's a 6:15 hours long bus ride. Blah. Then, I'll probably pull an all-nighter catching up on the FMA episodes I missed (my sister's got them downloaded). Will be seeing Shadow too, I expect. I never see him enough to my taste, though, considering he's supposed to be my horsie. And then, we leave to NB, which is I think another 6+ hours long ride? My dad doesn't even know if we'll go to Moncton -- my sister and I would go by to visit Yan and Ricky, maybe I'd say hello to Renelle (my childhood best friend). Next Monday, my dad's girlfriend and her two girls will join us to grandma's house, and we'll be leaving that weekend. I have to be there by Monday, since I have to monitor the horseback riding camp. Money.   Hm, yah, money. My lessons are getting expensive, and I don't know if next year I'm babysitting. When I get to University, I'll probably drop my lessons anyway, but I plan to go to Quebec in the summer vacation (yay 4 months!). I'll be able to ride Shadow. I might get a job there, too, so I can buy a English-riding saddle or something. I'll be happy to live in the basement with my sister (oldest, I'll call her kalika) - I'll bring my computer, hee.  And we're going to the con after all! Kalika said we'd be sharing our hotel room with sisters she knows from her lj. Also, we'll be cosplaying Ed (me) and Al (restored) from FMA - the coats and shirts will cost 300$, and she's paying 200$ (...she insisted). Since she got money, she also decided she's pay for eveything except my ticket to the con and my share of the hotel fee (and whatever I want to buy myself). I  .> Oh, right, now I'm freaked out because Kalika joined the Subby forum. *groans* She hasn't posted, so maybe it's just to keep an eye on stuff... -.-  Well on the bright side, the FMA wallscrolls and keychains (Roy, Ed, Al) we ordered from Ebay should arrive at around the time we're back from NB (also, our coats will be ready). I'm floating on a cloud, and I don't want to fall back to Earth.

      This fucking period is totally unnatural. I just ended my damn period 10 days ago, and now WTF it's restarting. T-T It explains the food-craving but... I hope my pj pants can be salvaged. -.- I feel frustrated, obviously. And lately I feel like there's nothing worth doing. Must be PMS - I'm kinda glad, it's not depression. '-' Well, I feel like some ranting's coming...  So I'm having fun getting my little sister to memorize japanese greetings and common words. Caro wants to learn, it's cute. ...Alright, maybe I shouldn't have taught her 'kawaii', she's bouncing all over. Her pronunciation isn't great - not even good. And yes, I'm getting annoyed for nothing. Damn this sucks.  I need to clean my room. Actually, the whole house needs cleaning. I'm fucking tired of being the only responsible one in this house. *I* clean, and they make a mess. That's one of the things that make me depressed. Everyone is fucked up.   Ungrateful little twits my sisters are. Even my older sister - if she gets a gift she doesn't like, she doesn't even thank the person. She sulks - like intentions are worth nothing - and gets in a worse mood if the gift cost a lot (what a waste of money). She's like that: all happy, or all unhappy. She likes staying in the basement and writing about FMA (incest, yaoi, violence, smut, etc), watching anime (mostly FMA), etc. Also prone to depression, doubts she has a future (she hates University). Goes to bed at sunrise (an habit I seem to be following myself, lately). I love her, though. Miss her.  My little 14-years old sister, Evil, beats up our little sister, insults our mother, and spends her time screaming and depressing when away from the computer. She releases her tension at home, since at school she's very quiet and 'an angel'. Suckers are the people who think that. Her hobbies include walking around naked, insulting anything moving, playing Unreal tournament and taking naughty pictures of herself to send to her online boyfriend. Sparodically nice, but very susceptible.  My youngest sister, who's 11, spends her time away from home, playing with the neighbours. She's naturally very annoying (ugh, that high-pitch scream of hers!) and Evil can't stand her. Very stubborn, she doesn't hesitate to annoy Evil until she gets hurt. When she's home, she mostly bothers me, but keeps me company. Sometimes sneaks into my bed at night before I go to sleep, and when I get there she's taking all the space. She can be a little manipulative devil, pleading and screaming and threatening our mother until she gets what she wants.   Mother. Weakling. Always away, even though she doesn't work that much. 1-I wish she'd find a steady job. I understand my dad was the one working before he left, and she hadn't worked in 18 years. But she went from gardener to teacher to massage therapist to cook (...and more). 2-I wish she'd clean the house, and stop helping to mess it up! Everyone in my house is ashamed and so, we don't have visit. It makes me feel guilty to always go to my friend's house, when I don't invite her over. 3-I wish she'd scowld my little sisters. There is no discipline in this house, and it seems my mom can't say no. She rewards Evil, when you kow how terrible she is. Example? She bought her a damn Gamecube for Christmas, at the time when she didn't have a job! So I told her it had to be a gift for the three of us. Also, she does nothing when she gets insulted - the only thing she can do, is scream, and of course we're used to do by now. Nice irritant. UGH, whatever. 4-I wish she'd cook our meals... She isn't there too often, when she could be. We don't eat at regular hours, and as a result my little sisters often don't eat well, if at all. Of course I often bake something, but they're not around to eat. Currently? She's at a family party with her girlfriend.  I curse the day my dad left. And now he's moved in with his girlfriend, where my older sister lives. I wonder what keeps me sane. Er, maybe I'm *not*. You tell me.

      Such a state of exhaustion shall never keep me away from writing! And chatting on msn! And rping! (Well actually, I think I'll settle down for the Subby rp, since I'm leaving next week). I learned Ryo has a blog for Joshua, her so-adorable-goth-boy-rp-character-that-I-squee-over, which is amusing. I might do the same - Ryo has weird ideas, and sometimes she scares me (in a good way mind you) but she's very smart. I love her writing, and drawings, and she agreed to rp Joshua with my vampire Kano.   Why am I exhausted? A simple combinations of these factors:  -1 hour horseback riding  -2 hours swimming, water-fighting, attempting to stand on floating board -40 degrees Celsius  Urg, I can't stand thinking! My brain is aching so much. >.  I really need to go to bed.

      What I did all week-end? Role-play, draw, eat, get to bed at sunrise... among other things.  The funniest thing though, I almost eloped on Friday night with a 21-years old guy. Sounds risky, and my friend made me realize it - I'm such a risk-taker, I'd have gone back to Ottawa with the guy to his apartment (yes, we know each-other from the web). He was ready to come and get me - to watch a movie and talk, mind you. :P  (Luckily though, on the pretense that I have no sense of direction and so couldn't tell him how to get here, I refused. And erm, it's actually true.) I told him I'd ask my mom to drive me there so it's safer (and I might), and Neko was relieved. I heart Neko.  I was just reading some FMA fanfic on FF.net since it had 40 reviews (the most after my sister's G&C story) so I figured it had to be better than the other (lousy) fanfics. It wasn't bad, but I commented on the girl's writing flaws and proposed my services as a beta. And guess what, looks like I'll have even less time to waste. ^-^;;  And I've been listening to ''Gessekai'' most of the time (by Buck Tick, from the Nightwaler Soundtrack (I like that anime - vampiiiies!)). It's a song I just can't get tired to hear! Just... sexy voice... lyrics... don't make sense... seksy voice... *droolls* ^.^  ...I definitely need to get some stuff done, instead of just reading webcomics (what I did a lot this week-end). I currently read: Sublunary Saturnalia Avalon Venus Envy Lean On Me For the Love Of Yaoi Your Wings Are Mine Nihilism Legends of Rovana Okashina Okashi Mega Tokyo Penny Arcade Neko The Kitty Carrots and Cheese Red Moon White Whiskers ...and I'll edit that list as I think of the others. Man, major cramps. *dies*

      So, my sisters and mom are gone to the cottage - weekend all by myself! I didn't feel like going, and anyway I'm supposed to water my neighbour's plants tomorrow. So, I won't be driving this weekend either... -_-  I'm bored, so I'm going to list all my friends and stuff. o.-  Isabelle: My best friend, who've I known since 9th grade. We met in English class, when we had to pair up with someone. She tapped on my shoulder (sitting behind me) and asked if I wanted to be with her. I said yes, and later on when I was walking after school she ran up to me (I was surprised), so we talked and walked home (we live in the same neighbourhood). We became best friends quickly, and it's thanks to her I like the show Buffy and Angel (really, I like Spike) - she's obssessed with them (and Alyson Hannigan)! She also loves wolves, for some reason, and reads avidly the books my sister wrote (but didn't publish yet) - which is weird, because they contain shounen-ai and she's far from being a fangirl. Either she likes something, or she doesn't - she doesn't give out her opinion, never cries (in people's presence anyway) and refuses to tell me who she got a crush on! She likes reading (Buffy books, V.C. Andrews, Harry Potter...) and is the best in math (she got 95% as a final grade). She is very stubborn and doesn't like large group of persons, so whenever our group of friends go out she doesn't come. Our only outside activities consist of biking (to actually get somewhere quicker), swimming (at her sister's house), shopping, or going to see a movie (she doesn't like science fiction like LOTR, yet loves HP - very picky, even with her food). She's got two older sisters (they all look alike), who are 26 and 29 I think, and who recently gave birth to two baby boys. She's crazed over them, and even puts 'Aunt Isabelle' as her msn name. Isa can be annoying sometimes - if she complains too much (the only opinion she gives), repeats herself (sometimes she tells me a story, or an argument, she's told me like 4 times already!) or refuses to do something (like go out or try something new). But apart from that, I'm over at her house very often, we understand each-other, we laugh and have fun, she's always ready to help me (eg. math). She even said she'd die for me. I feel the same.  Chelsey: A very peculiar girl, who jokes around and doesn't like a lot of people (I'm glad she likes me)! She's English, so often talks it, but her French is excellent (she adresses me in French all the time). :P I've known her since fifth grade, but at the time I loathed her because she was the teacher's pet (still sucks up, but I find it amusing - I also do it, but more discretly). And lets face it, she's always been a little annoying and sometimes doesn't know when to shut up (she says things out loud, so people can hear - it's embarassing). I restarted to talk to Chelsey because Isa hangs out with her. She's quick to fire up and says what she thinks - for example, when we saw HP3 she told the kids behind us ''I'm sorry, are you going to talk through the entire movie?'' (she can be quite polite) and they shut up. Another time, she told a girl, Caroline (whom she really dislikes) that she was stupid (I think so too), but at other times she's very nice towards her (even though she hates people, she still helps them out. She's smart and works hard on projects). Chelsey is nice and sweet, if you don't piss her off. She recently took a liking to calling us 'twits', and is the only one in our group who says 'fuck you' (friendly). She's also got a very cute brother... -o-  Jessica: Jess is Chelsey's best friend, and they're both good friends with Tanya (see below). She's quiet, but very funny when you get to know her - she can laugh quite easily. Chelsey told her once: ''You're such a ham.'' Don't ask me what that means, Jess was just teasing her like she often does. :P Jess comes from New-Brunswick (like me), and of course we both adore seafood! She's got an accent obviously (I lost mine), and we sat together in 9th grade, in science class. I only become her friend this year, when we had classes together and she hung out with Isa/Chelsey. She wasn't very bright in 9th grade, but now she gets good grades, even though she's a bit slow (if we do team work, I have to tell her what to do). She's got a sister who's coming to our school next year (like mine) and supposed to be very smart. I don't know much about Jess... uh, her parents are lawyers and travel often, she lives in MV... ^^;;  Tanya: Probably the nicest person I've ever met, though far from being innocent. If she asks you what you prefer between fries and onion rings - better not to answer. Lets just say that once, we went out and Mel (her best friend) did a nice demonstration with her food. XD She graduated high school this year, and is going in Physics at University - she's an elite student, top of the school. She does tutoring inside and out of school, always helpful and wearing a smile. I only became her friend recently, when we begun hanging out a little because Chelsey, Jessica and Isabelle are all her friend! She has a brother, Dabid, who's smart but not particuliarly cute - I'd go out with him, though; David speaks mostly to Chelsey (and Jess since they hang out). I really admire Tanya, she's very easy to make friends with...  Sandra: A friend whom I talk to and get along with, but I don't know much about. She has a little sister (who's in 9th grade). That's about all I know, lol! Really, we don't talk often because we don't have classes together, and usually my other friends are there so we group-talk. We talk about class and all, mostly. :P

      I still haven't gone driving - the car's transmission has to get fixed. Hn, I'll go for a drive tomorrow I guess. So, of course, I passed my course (with 91%, like my best friend). We were correcting the test of the person sitted in front of us, and the girl (who goes to my school and is one year younger than me) technically failed - she got 21 mistakes, when the maximum is usually 12 (it's okay if you go over, depending on how much you got on the sign test). Yah, I made her pass - I mean, she's a really nice girl, and she was paying attention in class (I also know I would hate it if someone made me fail). Of course, she had lots of mistakes, so I hesitated... but I say, the course is expensive, and all that. Anyway, my mom just went to the mail, and I got my G1 card! Now, I'm the only person in my call who hasn't driven... ever.  I feel special, in a bad way.  -.-  I find it ironic that with my driver's license, they also sent an organ donor card. -o- Although, I do want to donate my organs when I die... And I'll give blood when I'm the legal age to (I think it's 17 or 18). My friend has 0 type blood, but she doesn't want to donate because 'she doesn't like shots'. Neither does my mom (she donates every time she can), and I shake whenever I see the needle. Not liking shots is not an excuse - if you could safe someone's life by getting a shot, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you want others to give their blood in case you need it, especially if it's a rare type? Hn.  I'll go eat or something now. >.> (Just talking about shots makes me dizzy. -_- )

      She loved my drawing - ''OMG that's so beautiful! You didn't tell me you were an artist! Thank you! *hugs*'' And she hung it on her wall. ^^;; She's very generous to have given me money for my horseback riding lessons, so it's the least I could do to thank her... I went there, we talked, I stayed over for dinner, talked some more, she made calls to buy a farm house (with stables!), but it was sold, talked some more, said I looked tired (I was), went home.   Then read. ^^ I started a drawing for my sister's fanfic, Gold&Charcoal. Envy turned into Roy... since I love those two, I just had to draw it. >.> Evil, evil Envy who killed Hughes!  ;-; *sigh* She writes very well, sometimes I wonder if she realizes how much I love her work. And her. I miss her so much...  Death in fiction, death in life. My best friend's friend is in a coma - he was hit by a car while on his moto. I hope he lives - my bf already suffered the death of many... In my family, the only people I was close to who died was my grandpa (1998) and great aunt (2000). I've never had friends die, but she has... she hadn't ever met her grandparents either. Anyway, my best friend wasn't able to concentrate, all that talk about deadly accidents and motos and... :/  That's right, I have homework for my driving class... there was a bit of Physics today. I realized I remember stuff (usually, I forget. like math, ugh), and really enjoy the theory... I wonder if I'll regret not taking Physics next year, but I won't go in sciences at University so I guess not (and I'll get a better grade in psychology for sure. I also don't want to have my three sciences at the same time again!).  ...Little sister still crying. Oh, and my cousin went over to Ottawa to retrieve one of the kittens that were taken there without his permission. It cost his parents 175$, but it's his birthday present. Stupid person who brought the kitten there - my little sister is still heartbroken, the kitty cost my cousin lots, and they put down the black one because it had an infection. *sighs* I don't feel like writing anymore, I'm a bit depressed (among other things, my horseback riding lesson didn't go that well, I wonder if I should still take some...)

      Neko introduced me to this great webcomic, Nihilism (I stayed up until 2 am to read it)! It's shounen-ai, and though the art style is somewhat strange (the characters are really thin and tall), I love it. The artist is also rather strange (and yay gay), and I like him too. I drew Malache, a villain (I love villains!), as soon as I was done reading the pages up to date. >.> When I like something, I usually 'squee!' and draw. I want to wait before joining the forum, though. I'll try to get my piece of art done before, as a 'gift'. Anyway, I still haven't figured out how to make my scanner work. Bad for fanart...like Subby, I can't submit my entry for the contest.  ;-;  So I do other stuff - I did some oekaki, and now I have to work on dolls ('quest' of sorts). I don't feel like it much though, Oliver's form kinda looks like a girl... and Ryo is better...  Anyway, I got 100% on driving test. Hm, that reminds me, I have to work on boating exam. Oh, I always wonder if my G1 card has arrived. Though, I noticed the area code is mispelled on my temporary permit, so I might not receive it. Guess it's have to make a call anyway and change it... Today, neighbour girl talked to me (and my friend), so that's nice. :) Our instructor is also very funny, even if in his examples he often makes little Johnny die. ^^;;  Hm, did I mention McCain chocolate cake is a vice? :P  I ate almost half a cake yesterday, almost half today. >.> (I don't feel like eating other stuff. We have, like, ham and conserves). My little sister's obssession is currently watching HP puppets... potterpuppetpals.com.  It reminds me of when she was like 8 and watched 'Beauty and The Beast' over and over and over again...  Well, I have to go over to my neighbour's. The mom of the kids I babysit during school is going to give me money for my horseback riding lesson, as a bonus, because she likes me! I'll give her that neat horse drawing I did... She wants to discuss if I can water her plants while she's away too.

      Hm, I'm tired. Driving class from 9 to 4... I have to pass tomorrow's test (it's signs, but still). The course is in English after all, and the neighbour girl is taking it too, but she hasn't spoken to me. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow - after all, I know I appear cold to most people, and maybe she's also not the kind to be all 'Hey, hello! Can I sit next to you?'. ...Anyway, the seat next to me is taken (blah).  Talking about driving courses - my mom bought the 'boating safety' manuel *in English* (so I wasn't happy), I just have to fill my exam (which goes with the pack) and hand it out. I read the manuel while at the cottage.  So, I came back from the cottage yesterday and got to bed (because I hadn't slept well, and I got up early that morning to go fishing). I woke up later, but didn't feel like writing in my blog. My muscles are aching, since I did water skiing. I tried like 15 times to get on the skis, but didn't work! The following day, I tried again, automatically putting my arms around my legs. That did the trick. -o- (My legs would split up because they were too separated, or I would get pulled and dive head first in the water). It's really tiring though, and I didn't enjoy it much. I'll try again later...  In other news, I joined Neko's requiem forum, and they started a hentai rp... I won't participate, because er - I don't like hentai? Yaoi, yum... Hentai? Blah. >.> Yep, that's all for now. :P

      Going to the cottage today (supposedly), so won't be back before Sunday. My mom wants me to pass my motomarine license, but I don't think I have time for the courses (plus, they're in English). Blah. Anyway, I'm excited - I want to do water skiing, I've never tried before (I was too weak). :P  Oh, I didn't mention my schedule yet, right? Weekends will also be used to go to cottage, probably.  Well, this weekend: cottage 12-16: driving courses 19-22: away in laurentides (staying at hotel, water park, seeing a play - and my friend's dad is paying, whee!) 26-?: in NB, visiting grandma  August First week: probably still in NB 9-13: horseback riding camp 27-29: Toronto, CNanime (not sure if we go yet)  Talking about anime... turns out that if I were a guy, I'd be seme. *blink* I wanted to see which cute uke is most like me, but er didn't work out. -o-   urlLink     The Yaoi Selector: Which Uke are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    September 1st (a Wednesday) is back to school. -.- First semester I have English, biology, sociology and chemistry (should be fun). Second term I have accounting, French, calculus, and a free. Oh, how I fear calculus! *shudders* I tried going to websites and see what it was about, and I didn't understand at all. -o- At least I have a free, so more time to work on that... like I will. :P

      This morning, I awoke to the sound of my little sister's cries. The kittens she cared for have been taken to Ottawa yesterday, without my cousin's permission (they have been caring for them ever since they were found, and they both really wanted one. He was very mad, while my sister was very sad...) I told him I would go over to his house, but I didn't even call. I feel horrible - I got to bed at 5:30 this morning, was awoken around 12:00; I told him I'd be there at 9 o'clock. I figured, might as well just call him tomorrow, when he's calmed down... :/  I finally met my neighbours. The girl is very nice and easy to talk to - she's the kind of person who makes you comfortable in her presence. I tried to be friendly (and hope I achieved to be) - we went over to her house, and played cards (cheat - I think it's also called bullshit?) with our siblings (her brother and sister, my little sister). Only Evil (my fourteen years old sister) has yet to meet them. The boy (who's 15) should definetely cut his hair, is friendly and somewhat funny, asked lots of questions. He's going in grade 11, but that's because he skipped his fifth grade. I think we could be good friends.  Now, I should eat. I've only eaten a bowl of oatmeal this afternoon. :P

      Yep, I had horseback riding (that was why I wanted to know if it was Wednesday). Was fun even if I didn't feel my best (hadn't eaten...), cantered and stuff, even though it rained. My cousin is amazing; he never fell off his horse (even when Sam got excited and galloped a few arena lengths before calming down). I fell off twice in September (after taking the summer off), that's all. One was stupid; I simply slid off the saddle after a jump (the ground was uneven so I was unbalanced). Tango's hooves hit my head (bless my helmet), and he stepped on the back of my leg (it was the coolest bruise ever, hoove-shaped!) The second, it was my horse who stopped so abrubtly I went flying over his head and under the fence (it's just an electric cord), hit my leg on a metal bar and landed on my back (my shirt was all grass-stained). Since then, I haven't fallen.  Anyway, here's a cute video of Shadow that my sister took with her digital camera! He's 28 months old now (2 years, 4 months), a quarter horse gelding, and if he's got some white fur it's because of his mother, who was an Apaloosa. His mane is the softest I've ever touched... I luv Shadow.  http://membres.lycos.fr/shakiramaxwell/vid.MOV

      So, my little sister has friended the neighbour girl. My older little sister - Evil - says that the boy (who's in fact 15) looks girly because he wore a bandana and his hair is a bit long. She's such a twit (and now spends her time watching FMA episodes. I approve). Anyway, the little girl told me that her sister was only staying for the summer because she was to complete her 12th grade back in Kingston. She's, however, probably taking the driving course with me (and my friend). I'm already sad without knowing her, but I guess I could make friends with the guy. >.>  If what my sister says is true, he might be a bishie. o-o  Anyway, while I was away at my friend's cottage I learned to knit. Interesting eh? I have to buy some wool and needles and start making a Slytherin scarf.

          urlLink  Which HP Kid Are You?         Click  urlLink here  to take the quiz!      You are the most universal mythical beast ever. Sightings of the unicorn have been reported from all over the world, even in these modern times. Unicorns are pure and incurruptible. In China, unicorns symbolised gentleness, good will, and wisdom. Christianity links the unicorn with Christ. It is said that unicorns would only allow virgin girls to see them, let alone touch them. They were easily lured into fatal ambushes by a virgin with some potchers waiting for the unicorn in nearby bushes. A unicorn's horn was a highly prised possesion, which was reputed to have great healing capabilities. With the touch of its horn, a unicorn could bring back a person who had been dead for several hours. But when disattached from the unicorn's body, the magic was suggnificantly reduced and could only protect against poison. The unicorn had the body of a horse, a unique spirling horn, and a lion's tail. They were pure white in color. Congradulations, you are a rarity amoung mythical beasts. There aren't enough of people like you in the world.  What mythical beast best represents you? urlLink  Take the quiz!

      So it's official, I'm taking driving lessons next week. And the girl next door, who just moved in (today), is supposed to do so too. I have yet to muster the courage to meet them (it's my mother who went over to speak with their parents). It's amusing that they're of our age. The girl is 16, and so am I. Her brother is 14, just like my sister. Their little sister is 10, while my little sister just turned 11. They supposedly moved a total of 18 times 0-0 , because their dad is in the military. As an excuse for not going to knock on their door yet, I was playing the game I bought for Game Cube, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban. My best friend bought it for the computer, but the two are different! It's more fun, more complicated, and longer on GC though. So anyway, I guess I'll poke my head outside now and hope the neighbours are outside.

      As I was telling my friend GS (*waves to Gs if he's reading this*), I wuv evil. I was preoccupied when I found myself researching about Marilyn Manson (he had always intrigued me, all I knew is that most people found him disgusting), read some interviews, and found him hilarious. >.>  He's weird, he's goth, he's shocking and grotesque... I like him.  o.0  Not that his music is the greatest (...and I've only seen like three video clips anyway...), but I think his attitude is amusing. *blink* I don't see why people like Ozzy Osbourne and not MM... >.> *coughs* Anyway, I just wanted to add this. :P

      It appears the driving course is only given in French next week. I cannot wait to take it, because afterwards I'll need to wait 8 months before being able to test drive. I need my G2s to be able to go to University... (Oh, and I went for my G1s last week, and of course passed...) So, next week, I can't work at the summer camp at the stables. And they haven't asked me for this week - I'm pissed. I'll tell them I'm available in August... -_-  Also received my report card - was surprised, got 76% on Physics exam. Maybe I should have taken Physics next year instead of Chemistry (in which I only got 69% on exam. Which, for me, is low. I expect of myself a minimum of 75%.)  French: 89% (note on exam: 85%) Biology: 90% (note on exam: 90%) Chemistry: 71% (note on exam: 69%) Physics: 76% (note on exam: 76%)  You'll notice that in biology and physics, the exam is the same grade as my final note. >.>  In French and Chemistry however, the exam results are lower than my final grade. Amusing - I expected the contrary.

      Hmmm, I wonder what's the point of a journal if no one reads it. I guess it's for myself, and if someone finds this and is amused (yes, my life is laughable) I guess it's worth it. Also, the people (friends) I give this link to will know what goes on in my life. *blinks* I'm writing all this because I was thinking of giving up on my journal - but heck, I'll keep it... why not?  So, lately, I haven't written because I was gone to my best friend's cottage. Her step-brothers are hot. *blinks* And she got to see Mat going out of his shower (yes, without a towel!)  >. .>  Mat is taken (and too old anyways), but not Ben. It's not that I'm in love with Ben - it's just a crush. I asked Isa, and she thinks he's 19 or 20. Only about three years older than I... *grins*  Hm, in other news my older sister feared I might read her livejournal (kalika maxwell, if you hang around), and it just makes me curious enough to go and take a look. But I won't, because it's weird and she wouldn't want me to. Also, I guess it's better for me not to know what she thinks - if she's scared I'll read it, it must be because she says private stuff she wouldn't usually say to me. And oh, she just logged on msn. She's a night creature, sleeps almost all day and when she's up... she writes. About FMA, mostly. FMA yaoi, yuri, gore, angst, armor!Al sex... >.>  (Yes, I had to add that one). I finished drawing that EdxRoy picture I started months ago... I also drew characters from Sublunary... with my mouse, because my scanner still doesn't work. Anyway, I'll post all that stuff later.  Quicktime also won't work for me to view FMA episodes. Develops my angst. Oh yes, I'm more than a bit frustrated. I also have to call the stables tomorrow to know if they need me Monday for the horseback riding camp (no, they haven't told me yet and when I called nobody answered)... *grumbles*  Ricky is sweet. He lives in NB, and I'm going there at the end of the month to visit my grandma and go to our family reunion... and he wanted to meet me. *shrugs* We're both shy, so I have no clue how it will turn out. But like I said, I like Ricky. *nodnod*  And now, I shall lurk.
