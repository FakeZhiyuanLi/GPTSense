      Sigh...time realyy flies so fast...without me realising, a week has passed and I haven't thrashed out anything in here. Have been busy with work..meetings here and there...really killing me softly...but told maself not to get any negative further...self-control...patience....those are the keys in achieving happiness..(dunno how true actually)... By the way..what shit am I typing? Craps and nothing but craps...   Sometimes I wonder...why am I fated to meet someone so nice but I can't have him eventually? Is it called  fate when I was the one who initiated to get to know him? whereas I can jolly well stop myself from chatting... but to stop chatting after I got hooked to it for 10 years?- how to, man? People come and go in our life..but some nice ones are there to stay...linger in your life....make you feel appreciated that you form part of their lives... but at the end of the day, one special person that stands out from the crowd is still not YOURS!!!!!!!   Recently...encountered someone from the net..obviously he appeared the suspicious sort..I couldn't care much..but he never fail to make my day with his sweet thoughtful, funny SMSes...somehow..I began to open up to get to know him better... he indeed is a nice person...friendly...funny...and the best part is...he is a true gentleman!!!!. When we first met...I never thought that he would turn up..you know lah..those blind dates..never seems to turn out rite...but he is an exception..Indeed he still makes a gd impression up till this very moment. We had a supper at Fisherman's Village..with live fire shows...nice calamaris...and we practically talk anything under the sun....ooopsss...moon I should say...

                  Today was a tiring day...not bcoz of work but I'm tired of sleeping...Been sleeping eversince I got back from ma 24 hours duty...just woke up 2 hours ago...watched t.v and stuffs..and now I am really bored..No frens are online to chat with....practically nothing to do at home...just a stranger living together..someone who is just difficult to communicate with...and the worst part is..I am missing someone....very damn badly....it's been long since I last saw him...wonder...wonder...wonder...when can I see him again???????                  Tomorrow gotta work again...at least that can keep me occupied...or else my mind will start to linger.....sigh...

Fizal took leave for the whole of this week..... Can't wait to go out and watch movie with Y next Friday...gonna watch King Arthur. We planned to watch it at Great world city...hopefully I am able to give him that surprise dat I have planned...

      Cinta Mencintai Kita - Nurul & Ajai   Tidak pernah ku sangka Rupanya kau lebih ku cinta  Dari hati yang putih Ku hadir untukmu sayang  Aku turut merasa gelora Yang menghempas jiwa Biar lama ku tunggu Ku pasti kau tiba  Kau selalu menduga, menguji Kejujuran di kamar hati Membuatku dihimpit oleh keresahan Ohh...ohh... Kita memendam rasa dan bermimpi  Terbang ke langit Langit yang tinggi Bertemankan awan indah memutih  Sambut tanganku sayang Bawaku ke syurga impian Tiada lagi curiga Oh...Yeah Kaulah yang ku cinta  Kasihku kasihi dia Cinta mencintai kita Kasih ku kasihi dia  Ohh...Ohh...Ohh...

      Haiya blogggieee... its been a decade since I last pen down sumthing....A lot of things happened throughout June..my aunt got married... Euro 2004 started.. went out with close frens...meetings and stuff...and not forgetting my gruelling 24 hours shifts that I have to do once a week...  I went to the 'Pinocchio on Ice' show last Sunday..a very entertaining show...worth the money..hehehehe...I brought ma little cuz along...he enjoyed it too...it was a whole lot of fun especially with 2 of my craziieee colleagues; Angela & Kalai...  The most happening thing that ever happened in my life was to be able to get close with a male chatter that has all along been around in my life for the past one year or so... Let's just name him 'Y'... Y has always been known as someone very funny...mature...man of little words...always deep in tots... but overall a very fun company to be ard with...i have liked him for quite a while...eversince he was posted to Vietnam for the Sea Games last Nov...I managed to make some Hari Raya cookies for him to bring along to Vietnam... we met quite often for karaoke sessions...supper with my bestest fren..Laila.. he came over for my Hari Raya Openhouse...I still remembered he gave me a blue silk cloth from Vietnam as a souvenier...dats really sweet and thoughtful of him....there's so much to say about him...its gonna last an endless blog...hehehhee..the whole point is..I am glad that we can talk openly abt things...share problems, views together...and he is very gd in giving constructive feedbacks...and mind you....he really is damn cool lor....  No doubt the guy that often gave me sweet Smses everyday....is nice too..but this 'Y' guy is more real.....coz I see him more often than other guys..... its not a physical kinda attraction that I have for him but I guess its more of his personality that I adore...I know I can't have him but by just being around him...makes my day.... nuthing more that I cld ask for... beggars cannot be choosers ..I supposed...hehehehehehehehe.....
