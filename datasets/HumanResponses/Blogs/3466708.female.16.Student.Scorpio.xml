      Ok quick bio. Maybe not so quick. We'll see.  My name is Sophie, I live in B.C, Canada and I love it here. I am a proud Canadian. Go me. It's not hard to do but yeah..heheh. Umm I'm in grade 11 and mostly, I enjoy school. I like seeing people every day and hanging with my friends and on occasion I learn some interesting stuff. I plan on attending college nearby and then maybe later university (Ryerson I hope!) and I'm looking forward to that because everyone says that it's a totally difference experiance from highschool so that should be interesting right? If I don't go, I'll feel like I missed out anyway. lol I plan on becoming a journalist so I'll probably try to get my bachelor of journalism. I would really like to write for magazines, maybe a teen magazine. No, not because I like doing my hair, make up and talking about hot guys (Ok I do but that's besides the point!) but because I want a job in which I can reach out to people..through writing because that's what I love to do..and teenagers are the ones I would really like to communicate with.  I find us interesting. lol But anyways what else..well, I live with my two younger sisters and both my mom and my dad. We all get along abnormaly great. When I was younger, I used to wish that something bad would happen in my life. I know that sounds fucked up but it all seemed too perfect to me and I felt like an outcast. Rather hard to explain. I'm a happy gal, it takes a lot to get me really down although I am pretty moody. I think that comes with being a Cancer. I don't believe all those horoscope bug shit that people tell ya but when it comes to the descriptions of the signs, man, I've gotta believe that because it fits me to a tee. lol I am emotional, sensitive, caring..I suppose I do have high standards when it comes to guys and maybe that's why I don't date much. Who knows. I'm not really looking for a boyfriend, I just go with a flow..I'm quite laid back.  So yeah, I dunno what else to tell all of ya'll. I was born in the city, now I live in a small town so I've sorta got those two sides to me. We'll see how that turns out.  I want to travel more in the future, there are a lot of amazing places out there to see.  I've been to Cali, Mexico and Hawaii, oh and I'm going to Costa Rica later this year..that's about it really and although those places are beautiful and a lot of fun, they aren't all that exotic yanno? Ahk. My bio is getting too long, no one wants to read all this about lil ol' me! Even I don't. ^_^   So that's enough for now.   I watched the movie Gothika today. It's alright. Fairly suspenseful and the storyline was okay. Nothing to get too excited about though. ^.^  I wrote 2 poems today. Yeah, big deal, I know. Your sarcasm has been noted. =P Naw, but I'm happy 'cuz I haven't been writing lately and a lot of my poems, well, I don't even like them.  I haven't been writing for long tho, I'm still "growing". Heheh. I'm reading a Creating Poetry book by John Drury and it's fairly interesting. It gives you all these exercises to do which I like. I'm learning goiys, wheee! Hmm...perhaps I'll show you guys the finished poem I wrote today. Chances are I'll make changes it to later, I always end up doing that but oh well.  So this dude(Donald Justice) wrote a poem called On the Night of the Departure by Bus which was a redone version of Rafael Alberti's On the Day of His Death by an Armed Man and so I decided to give it a shot and so I wrote my version of On the Day of His Death by an Armed Man.  Which basically means I took the same idea and just made each line different. Make sense? Okay, here you go.   On the Day of the Last Trip by Train  Don’t try to tell me that you weren’t happy back then. 25 was more than an arms length away. A peanut butter and jam sandwich was still considered  fine dining.  I promised you with silent kisses that I would never grow old You promised me with silent kisses that you would never grow old. The silent kisses promised us both that growing old was inevitable by all standards.  Who would wish themselves dead?  The scribbled notes should be thrilled to have become literature. The withered bodies to have been silently kissed. And I for having the honor to admire the sheer simplicity of your Reeboks in the winter.   A fish is happy to have escaped the hook. The teenager for finding her once beloved teddy bear. And I…           I am happy that I can still cry real tears.                   Tears of joy or of sadness                         tears of…                   What does au revoir mean?  -Sophie MacCallum   And Rafael Alberti's original...   On the Day of His Death by an Armed Man  Come right out and tell me if those weren't the good old days. 5x5 was not yet 25 nor had the dawn considered the pointless existence of knives gone  dull.  I swear to you by the moon I won't be a cook, you swear to me by the moon you won't be a cook, he swears to us by the moon he won't even be smoke in such a sad kitchen.  Who died?  The goose is sorry for being a duck, the sparrow for being a professor of Chinese, the rooster for being a man, and I for having talent and marveling at how miserable the sole of a shoe usually is in winter.  A queen has lost her crown, a president of a republic his hat, and I... I believe that I have lose nothing, that I have never lost anything, that I...  What does buenos dias mean?  -Rafael Alberti

      Hi. I'm listening to Ben Folds Five-Song for the Dumped. Good song and yeup, I like 'em.    Oh, I went to the library today. That's not very exciting but I found the little dinky poetry section that they have and took out some books. I can't remember the names off the top of my head besides..Hunting with Hemmingway but yeah, hopefully there's some good literature there. A good read is hard to find and sometimes I do like to read things that actually make me think. Then again I also took out a few teen magazines..that doesn't exactly cause my brain to sweat. Heheh. I should hope not anyway eh? o_o  Wow my sister made chocolate mousse for dessert. That gal can cook! Well, I already knew that but still, she makes me proud. ^_^ I wubbish her so much. And not just 'cuz she makes good dessert. Meheh.  Morgan, Ash and I decided we should all live with her..well they decided to and I figured I had might as well follow. lol Good times to be had. Yeeeup.  A friend of my parents' is over. We've known her for almost 10 years now, real nice lady. She has kids the same age as my sisters and I and my dad is best friends with her ex hubby. So we all get along pretty well and whatnot. Anyways, I kinda enjoy..well I do enjoy..sitting with adults and just talking. Maybe that's weird, I don't know. I mean I like being around people of all ages but with adults you can carry on a more intelligent conversation and yeah..haha. I sound just SO damn cool. xD What am I trying to say? haha. Who really knows.   Hmm on the flip slide tho, I love hanging with my friends. Even if we're just doing fuck all it's still fun. We laugh a lot. I love to laugh. Everyone in the frikkin' world should laugh wayy more. Everyone would be so much happier. I mean, say you're in your local 7-11 and some guy is holding the place up and is all.."Give me all of your fucking money man before I shoot you!!" and everyone in the store just starts to laugh. Now, I wonder what the chances are that the dude with the gun would just start laughing as well, or would he just go ballistic and shoot everyone? Not really something I'm interested in finding out but hey, you've gotta wonder.  Actually you don't, I'm talking outta my white ass here. Whooeey. *Crazy signals*  I'm gonna watch LOTR 3 tonight. I saw it in theatres. Quite enjoyed it. I think that even if I didn't like the storyline all that much, which I do, but if I didn't..I would still enjoy the movie because I seriously think it was really well done. Lots of movies you watch 'em and think.."Wow this movie could be SO much better" but with LOTR I didn't think that. Sure there are parts that could have been cut out but I think that the directors were also showing respect to the author by trying to keep it going with the actual book. yanno? Anyways, a good movie IMO. Yup yup. Plus, hobbits are so cool. Haha. I wish we had hobbits..whoa ok shutting up now.  So I'm off now. Mooovie time. Whee. Fun with family. Hehe. Jk, gotta love 'em.   Stay tuned folks..tomorrow..a bio about..me! hah. Maybe. If I'm not lazy. ^_^  ciao. xox.

      Wow okay so I just decided to make one of these suckaz but I'm kinda too lazy to write anything of importance.(whatever that means) My sisters and my mom are in the room next to me watching Gilmore Girls and American Idol. lol Whee fun. No, not really. I'm just easily amused and sucked into all those american shows. Hah. 'tis all good. So yeah there's only like..oooh 16 or so school days left. Fucking eh man. What a relief 'cuz I'm soo ready for summer break to begin. As soon as the weather gets hot I just can't focus in school. It's a good thing I don't live in Florida or something. Hawaii. Yeah, I'd be dumb all year round then.  Anywho..(I hate that saying)I should be going. I have a math test tomorrow and something tells me I need to study for it. Maybe it's the fact that fact that I got 50% on the pretest today. Heheh. OOh maybe I can go driving tomorrow..got my L 2 weeks ago or something and I haven't been yet. I'm sorta nervous. Ahh. I don't want to run over any old ladies. That would actually be quite hard to do..ok well I'm gone. Love you all. Or some of you. Maybe none. Who knows. Who cares. Ciao. xox

      I was looking through some of my poetry and stumbled across the one that I entered into the poetry contest at my school. It's nothing spectacular lol but I won 1st place so I decided to share it with all of ya'll. I think it's nice that I won and its flattering..but I only entered because my moms always saying that if I wanna go into journalism I've gotta start entering contests and stuff. So yeah. Really, I don't write poetry for others to read. It's a personal thing that I've recently gotten really into. But hey, it's all good. I'll learn to share. :D Feel free to critique and/or comment, I always love that.   Craving Reassurance    Stubborn is my heart, stapled with unknowns. Holding hope in a childlike death grip  while searching for something more invigorating in belief that it will ease the fear  from my discouraged soul. Lead me to the stream  that I see so often in my dreams so that I may drink from it the reassurance that life is a fruit bowl, with not only sour lemons  but also sweet peaches. That,  when you take your first bite –burst with surprising flavor so wonderful that you pay no mind to the vexatious  trail of bitter sweetness  it leaves behind.

      I'm happy. Life's good yanno? Like..sure there's a lot of shit going on in the world and a lot of people have it really rough but I am thankful for everything that I have..or don't have..I dunno. I'm just thankful. And life IS beautiful guys, honestly it is. Sometimes the view just gets a bit blurry is all.  Anyways. That was random. lol So'z. Umm yeah so today..I had school. Only 3 more days left! Yay 'cuz I'm so ready for summer break to start. I still have exams though..bleh. OH well. My sister had gymnastics today so I went with my sisters and my mom into town for that and we shopped. I bought a candle holder and these lil candles that are buttermilk vanilla and scented and oh baby do they ever smell good. Indeed. I'm a fan of the scents, I must say. And then..we went out to dinner at a greek/italian restaurant which was pretty good, I've had better though. =P Now it's just us gals at home and I picked out a ballet movie to watch since my dad ain't home lol I figured this was a good time. I've never been in dance but I do enjoy watching it a lot..it's the girly girl part of me I guess. Who knows. It's called The Company by the way..I'll let'cha know if it's half decent or whatever. Damn I was going to make this a really short entry and now it's getting long. I can never give a simple answer to something. I realized that today. I deffiantly analyze things a lot but mostly, I figure that's not bad. I like to learn. I'm not ignorant. So..that's good right? lol Anyways..some person that I dont know *shrug* subscribed to my xanga and their entry had this survey and so I'm gonna fill it out because..well that was all I was gonna do but then I started yabbering on about who knows what.

I SEARCH> for music a lot..always dl shtuff. BAD SOPHIE, BAD! mwuah ha. I WONDER> what's it's like being dead. (I started thinking about that yesterday like just natually out of curiousity but then realized it's a waste of time because who really knows? Not moi.) I REGRET> umm..ordering lassagna for dinner because it was a bit of a disappointment..shoulda gone for the ravioli. :D  I LOVE> my family, friends, my country, music, laughing, sunsets, beaches..I could go on  I ACHE> in my head sometimes..I'm not sure why.

      'ello folks.  I haven't updated in a while, my bad..been busy though!   So my weekend was good. Friday after school I left with my family for Vancouver where we went and stayed at my aunt and uncles place. My uncle and cousin who moved to Norway 3 years ago were also there so that was awesome. I hadn't seen my lil cuz in so long. ^_^  Sat morning we went for a walk..whee fun..heheh..then that night we went to my great aunts memorial service which went quite well.  A lot of people turned out and my uncle that I was staying with gave a speech type o' thing. They actually called it a "family reunion" because it partly was just that. I didnt know half of the people there. So it was pretty cheerful and whatnot. Well, until they showed the whatsitcalled..slideshow on the computer..I can't think of the word >_  So anyways. Sunday we went to White Rock beach and shopped and swam and it was nice.  My weekend was pleasant..nothing too exciting but good all the same.  I like my family lol Good people.  I got home at about 11pm Sunday night which meant I had no time to finish that socials project..then..the next day I forget it at home. I'm just so fucking smart. Aye yi yi..so I'll probably get a shitty mark on it. Fuck you Mr. Annis..grr.  I went and got my courses all done for next year. I have..  Yearbook( I think I'm in it now anyway. Mr. Hutchins is kinda dumb tho so who knows..), English Lit, History, Geography, Writing, Law, English, Career prep, CAPP, umm what else...oh art! So yeah, sounds pretty good to me.  But I'm a let you feckers go now because this is soOo long.  Just gotta mention though..I met a boy. *holds back the girly giggling* It's a LONG distance relationship..but I think we can make it work. I sure hope so anyway. ^_^
