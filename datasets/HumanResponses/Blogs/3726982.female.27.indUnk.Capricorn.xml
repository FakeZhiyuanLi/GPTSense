      Just a quick thought here....from what I can see on the news and the quick notes I get from the  urlLink Modesto Bee , Scott Peterson's lawyer is doing everything he can to distract everyone instead of lay out a case showing that Scott didn't do it.  He is constantly calling for a mistrial.  He has talked to one of the jurors outside of the court, and now he is trying to use the excuse of sloppy police.  Is it just me, or do all these shenanigans really say "Scott killed his wife, but I can plant enough doubt to get him off"?  There is nothing that prevents Scott from telling Mr Geragos that he did it...He can't tell anyone else...Its his job to get him out of trouble.  Sounds like OJ to me.

      Recently, there has been a rash of videotaped executions on the other side of the world, most recently the shooting of the US soldier.  Obviously, there are a lot of reactions to this news, ranging from anger at the governments, anger at the countries, sadness, or just plain morbid curiosity.  For more info go to  urlLink Hot Ambercrombie Chick  Now, maybe to me it just all seems recent because I am not an avid watcher of the news (sometimes, I just don't want to know what is going on).  However, there is a lot of talk about whether we should be able to have access to watch these videos, or view the pictures.   Honestly, I feel like if I can't access the info I want, choices are being made for me that I don't want made for me.  You wanna protect me from something, protect me from the actual violence.  Don't report about it, and then not let me see it because you think I can't handle it.  If you want to censor something, censor yourselves.  If I can get my daily dose of violence (shoot outs, car wrecks, beatings, etc) by watching a movie, tv show, news program, WHATEVER, why is it not okay for me to watch a real-live action execution video? I love the country I live in.  I get to have the job I want, go where I want, raise my kids the way I want.  It is a country, however, that says "this kind of violence is okay to watch because no one actually died".  Why can we get so much sex and violence in the movies, yet is completely hidden from real life?  What are we so afraid of?  Sometimes our intentions are so good, but the choices our officials make for us are so retarded.  You can't please everyone, but you can't run their lives, too.  Not in this country. And while I am ranting, why is the government running everything?  Isn't this country supposed to be by the people, for the people?  How come some old ass white man telling me how fast I can drive, or a million other hainous laws that are meant to keep us from thinking we are capable of thinking for ourselves?  Maybe its that there are just so many stupid people in this country.  I am rambling, but I do have a point...all in all.  Our country needs change, change from censoring the wrong things, change from an all powerful and rich government, change from poverty in the streets, and many other changes.  I have a voice, and I will now be heard.

      Wow!  I spent a good portion of my day on the roof of my house.  I learned a lot about roofing...Mostly, that if anyone asks, I don't know how to roof.  What a pain in the ass.  The day started off promising, with an overcast sky.  But as the day wore on, the clouds broke up and the sun came out.  I ended up having to go rest because I had gotten a nasty headache (was it a migrane?  I don't know....how do you tell).  After about 2 hours of rest, I joined my hubby and his dad on the roof to finish up the back side.  We will do the front side tomorrow, and it will be done.  Im signing off...Im tired. If you read this...sign the guestbook...or make a comment.  I would love some feedback on this page!

      I was just reading about an interview with Monica Lewinsky.  Her first flaw is having an affair with a married man.  Her second is thinking that it was going to just disappear despite the fact he was the President. Right now, she is complaining that in his book, he failed to correctly address how he wrecked  her  life.  Hello?  The book isn't called "My Life with Monica".  He had to address the situation in the book, or it wouldn't sell.  He did not, however, have to even address her feelings because its not about her.  Its the story of him.   She says she is reluctant to talk about the whole situation, but she keeps going on about it.  If she really didn't want to  talk about it, she wouldn't be doing the interview in the first place.  Besides, do we really care about her opinion? She is also heard saying that it wasn't just an unfortunate occurance, but a full blown relationship.  Seriously, it's old news, Monica.  Get over it all ready.  Just because the American public can't stop talking about it or being curious about it, doesn't mean you have to go on and on and on about it.  If you are trying to get on with your life, do it already.  No one is holding you back but yourself.  Besides, he is the piece of crap that lied about it, and is casting it off as something it wasn't.  You are too old, and he is too married, for you to be acting like a teenager scorned.  Men are pigs.  What are you going to do?  Forgeddaboutit.

      I was up until 130 in the morning last night making my webpage all pretty.  Not a good thing when you have to get up to get ready for work, and your kids don't sleep well because they were stubborn enough to not eat the dinner that was put in front of them.  However, like I said I would, I have gotten obsessed with the page and want to make it a nice comfortable place for people to come, hang out, and chat.   The in-laws made it up here for their visit.  It was nice.  My son has gone absolutely bananas for his grandparents (they give him cookies) and my daughter is at least cordial.  The last time she saw them, she wouldn't even go to them.  It is a nice change for them.  We went out to dinner and just basically hung around the house.  They went back to their hotel around 10.   Today begins the new roofing process.  Right now, we are in the middle of some major home improvement projects.  We have taken down our deck and put in a patio, torn down the deck cover and put up a new huge patio cover, and now have taken all the wood shake shingles off the roof (which is good because all of the wood was so dry, it was just a matter of time before our house went up in flames) and are putting up new comp shingles.  I can't wait to see it.  We will no longer be the black sheep of the neighborhood in that respect (now if i could just get my butt outside to do a little landscaping, my neighbors would stop making fun of our yard).   Also being done today is my new windshield.  Some lowlife attacked it the other day while I was at work and left the most horrible scar.  It is not small enough to just get a repair.  The whole windshield needs to be replaced.  I guess I am glad that I didn't call my insurance company to fix the small ding on the other side of the windshield, or I would be really mad at having to do this more than once.  Oh well.  Maybe my boss will get me a better parking spot.  Probably not.  C'est la vie. Well, I have to get ready for work, and probably should pay a little attention to my kids.  They are in good hands, though.  Nonnie (Grandma) is playing with them while Daddy and Papa are on the roof. As always, have a good day, and drive careful.

      This is just a little shout out to Janelle, who I called early this morning.  She didn't bitch at me for calling while she was getting ready for work, nor did she try to stop my rambling.  I got it under control before I made her really late.  Thanks, Nellie (as I know you so long to be called) for being so gracious when all my incessant chatting about poopy diapers, lazy husbands, and vandalizing bastards goes on (and on and on and on and on and on.......) makes you want to hang up on me.  I love you, even if you are a tall skinny bitch. urlLink

      I just got into blogs recently.  My curiosity got the best of me last week when Paul Johnson was beheaded.  I am not the kind of person that loves to look at pictures of dead  people, but I just had to see them, so I searched and searched and searched.  I found a few blogs by linking my way to them.  I saw the pics, and then heard more about Nick Berg and Robert Jacobs, and so I had to check them out too.  By the way, the Nick Berg thing?  GROSS.  I don't care if its real or not, but it is just gruesome.  Anywho, I came across a music major in TX.  I read some of her things and got hooked.  I hope that I remember to catch up on her daily life once in a while.  And as an insurance csr (customer service representative), I hope that her driving improves too. Since I don't have the kind of life where I can just sit and write all day, I have to get out of bed (laptops are awesome) and get my kids and house ready for a visit from the out-of-state in-laws who are coming today. If by chance, some weird accidental clicking chance, someone is reading this, hello from me.  Welcome to the beginning of my blog, and what will become a huge obsession for me.   Have a nice day, and drive careful.

      There are few things I want to say, and none of it has to do with the other.  I just came to ramble.  First............................ I don't consider myself a Democrat.  I definately am not Republican.  Am I Independent?  I don't know.  What I do know is that there are things that are important to me.  I am not going to vote for the man who is in my "party";  I am going to vote for whoever addresses my issues the best and has my best interests at heart.  To vote for the person in your party just because you label yourself as they do is complete ignorance and blind trust.  There are too many of those types of people out there.  I think we should do away with the parties.  They are dumb labels and it unfairly keeps out others who want to run for certain races.  How 'bout we all just vote for who we believe to be the best candidate?  My husband wont vote for any incumbent candidate.  I think he has it right.  If you don't do your job right the first time for the people (that is who you work for.  we pay you, do it right), you are outta there.  Second.............................. I am a big weiner.  I saw E.T. at age 5, and my life was forever changed.  It scared the crap out of me for years, until I watched the "new and improved" version a couple of years ago.  It took me forever to watch all of the Ring.  I had to watch it in bits and pieces.  I would watch a little bit, take a week to get over what I saw, then watch a little more.  Rinse, repeat.  I am not sure I have even seen the whole thing.  I will never feel the same about a snowy tv screen or a mirror.  I can't go camping any more because of Blair Witch.  So, why do I want to see the Village so bad?  Because, I am dumb.  I like being scared, I think.  Not too scared, but just enough to make me leave all the lights on in my house, and never ever be in silence (too many creeks and such to listen to).  Third................................ Everyone review your driving manuals.  Just cuz you have your light on, doesn't mean you have the right of way.  READ THE FUCKING SIGNS.  It says "Slower traffic keep right" for a reason, you stupid piece of driving shit.  How the hell did you get your license?   K, Im done.

      As I blog my day away, I am also chatting with a friend through IM.&nbsp; And this is what I said :  Lizardbreath says:&nbsp; dangit, i just posted again  Lizardbreath says: its like i got diarrhea of the brain&nbsp; Nellie says: lmao  Lizardbreath says: its fun, i just cant stop myself, especially when i know people are going to be reading it and making me their fan of the month.  Lizardbreath says: i should blog that  Lizardbreath says: hangon, bloggin again  Lizardbreath says: seriously, its hot and steamy and it just keeps coming out....im not sure if i should be in the bathroom or not, but it sure feels like it.&nbsp; Nellie says: lmao  I should be painting my kitchen today.&nbsp; I think we are going to sell our house and move into a bigger home.&nbsp; That means I have to get my lazy bloggin ass in gear to fix up my humble abode in such a way that other people feel like they have to live here in less than 2 months.&nbsp; I have a lot of work to do.&nbsp; I think I will just do what I always do and procrastinate.&nbsp; It has worked for me so far.&nbsp;  How bout that.&nbsp; You are so lucky.&nbsp; Now I can just sit here and blog away and bore the shit out of you.&nbsp; Good for you.

      I have to say that when I started this blog almost a month ago, I really thought all I was ever going to talk about was my life and kids and stuff like that.&nbsp; Never did I think I would actually have something to say.&nbsp; I didn't think that anyone would want to read it, much less link to me and share my thoughts with others.&nbsp; For those of you who choose me to link to, thanks.&nbsp; It means a lot.&nbsp; Also, to those who let me choose them, thanks for making it possible for me to do so, and for letting me share your thoughts.   With that said..........   I hate Britney Spears.&nbsp; The girl disgusts me to no end.&nbsp; Its not her looks.&nbsp; She looks okay.&nbsp; Its definitely not her talent.&nbsp; She has none.&nbsp; I think that what bothers me the most about her is the way she treated JT.&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its the fact she is such an out in the open hypocrite and she apparently has no problem with it.&nbsp; I have a hard time liking liars, cheaters, whores and phonies, much less one person that is all of those.&nbsp; I really can't believe she still has fans.&nbsp; Who buys that shit?&nbsp; Really, like I am one to talk....I buy up all the Prince and Celine Dion I can get my hands on....But that is not the point.&nbsp;  She just has no talent or point.&nbsp; All she can do to drum up exposure is be a huge slut and nut case.&nbsp; I can't believe there are mothers out there that let their daughters listen to this degrading low life sing about all the shit she spews (honestly, i don't know what she sings about because when she comes on the radio, tv or whatever, i change the channel).&nbsp; I could give a crap how catchy her songs are because it is all a bunch of dumb shit that I would rather hear William Hung sing about than her.&nbsp; You're right. William.&nbsp; She bangs.

      I just have to bitch about this, but I will keep it short. &nbsp; Recently, during the trial, they brought out a mold for anchors that may have possibly held down Laci's body.&nbsp; The anchor did not fit in the mold in that it was smaller than the mold by about 1/2 inch.&nbsp; It just seems to me that Scott is going to get off on technicalities rather than actual proof that he didn't do it.&nbsp; I can't help but think that some of our laws are retarded and aimed at protecting the wrong people if those who commit crimes can get away with it.&nbsp; It just doesn't seem fair (how many times can we all say this before something is done!!!!!!).&nbsp;  &nbsp; How far does our country have to go in the wrong direction before it completely falls apart? &nbsp; How much power can our country possibly have if everyone is unhappy? &nbsp; When will someone realize that this is not the country our forefathers visualized? &nbsp; How can we possibly turn ourselves in to a country we can be proud of from where we are? &nbsp; Don't get me wrong... I am very proud to be a United Statesan (canadians, mexicans, and all the other American countries are "American" too).&nbsp; I just think our country can do better, and the Scott Peterson trial is an example of what is wrong with all of us.

      First of all, in my hunt to find new and interesting blogs to read, I found a page called  urlLink Being Angela Bowers .  It is amusing.  While I was reading, I came upon a post regarding  urlLink Hot Ambercrombie Chick .  I have linked to this Amanda Doerty myself, and in fact, her site is why I am doing this.  If I hadn't  urlLink Googled  my way to her while looking for sick and nasty pics of dead people one day, I wouldn't be blogging.   Anyways, I had often wondered about this college girl and what possessed her to blog about these sorts of events.  Some of my questions have been answered with  urlLink Hot Ambercrombie Hoax .  I thought it was interesting.  You can find more info on this at        urlLink Julia Set        urlLink Wizbang        urlLink Gender Genie  At these sites, you can link to other sources of info, and the Ambercrombie Hoax one has her other weblogs.  I am not saying it is a hoax or a hoax of a hoax, but that it is interesting that I am such a dumbass.  You have to decide the rest for yourself.  As for daily events in my life, I was just informed yesterday that my DH plans to finish working on our house by the end of summer.  He wants to  urlLink move out to the country  before the election.  I can agree with his line of thinking...Who knows what is going to happen to taxes and what direction our country is going to take?  However, I have become at home here, and though I do plan on moving out to a bigger place, I don't want to  put all this work into it and not enjoy it for a little while.  I just got the dishwasher and oven.  Let me dirty them up a little bit before saying goodbye.   I have to go clean my house now.  I am having company, and I don't want them to know what slobs my kids are.

      The movie Identity rocks.  It was very twisted.  Some things my DH and I figured out, but we never counted on the ending.  I highly recommend it.  I have been hearing a lot about the Brown Bunny lately.  Basically, if you haven't heard, it apparently has an unsimulated sex scene at the end of the movie where Chloe Sevigny gives Vincent Gallo oral sex.  The most horrid part is that the whole movie sucks ass, then there is this totally nasty and extended scene.  I am pretty sure I will regret it, and as the saying goes, curiosity killed the cat, but I will probably see it....I will wait until until it comes out on video (with the unrated version of course) or HBO (probably more like skinamax). Hey, I watched Gigli for the same reason, just curious what all the hubub was about.  And by the way, if you haven't seen Gigli..Don't.  It really does suck ass.  The writing is horrible, and if I have to hear Ben Affleck talk like that again, I might just slit my wrists.   I have also heard that there are apparently other movies with unsimulated sex, here in the United States.  Holy crap!  When did that happen?  I know that the French have a history, as well do the British (see Base Moi, i think it is called, and Nine Songs).  If Im not mistaken, aren't these porn?  Just my thought.  Currently I am watching Badder Santa, with Billy Bob.  So far, totally hilarious.  I would definately recommend it.  He is a truly obscene man, and it is great.  The language is crass and yucky.  His attitude is positively negative (the name of a good band I used to know), and I don't believe I have ever seen a bigger drunk.  Its a keeper.  Well, I have other movies just waiting to be watched.  If I can remember, I will give reports on all those too.  Maybe someone will love my recommendations one day, and I will be famous for my luscious thoughts and insights.  Enjoy.

       Have you ever watched this show? Penn and Teller Bullshit. They dispel a lot of bullshit. If you want your eyes opened to a lot of crap you have been fed for all your life, watch this show. The first time I watched it, they talked about recycling versus garbage. It was nice to hear that I am not a cretin for tossing out paper. I will recycle the crap out of aluminum cans because I get paid for that. But the way landfills are handled, the world is not going to fill up with garbage. I just watched one episode where they were talking about freedom of speech and the FCC. How true it is that the more you let the government handle, the less freedom you have. Seriously. One of the questions they asked was how many radio stations do you have versus newspapers. If you don't like what they have to say on one station, TURN THE CHANNEL. Don't censor it. Just get over yourself, take the power into your own hand and listen to something else. Same thing with the television. Same with so many things. Did you know that those who work for the FCC, who decide what is wrong and right with language, aren't voted upon? They are appointed by whatever dickhole is running our country. MMMMM. Lucky us. The show I am watching now is about death. One guy actually believes he isn't going to die. It is really all about how funeral homes rip people off. It is a very funny show that will get you to think about what crap you are fed, what you are told to believe is true, and other BULLSHIT that is put in front of you to get you to buy this and that. I love the way it is edited and the voice overs are hilarious. You can count on a good "HOLY SHIT!" or "FUCK MARK" peppered in with all the facts, comments, and opinions. I highly suggest this show, especially if you are a person who is highly suggestable and buys into a lot of Bullshit that is spewed from everywhere.  That means you, Lisa.

      Today, as I was hurrying back to work on my lunch break, I was cruisin' down good 'ol I 5, when some jackass decided he wanted to drive faster than me. Fine. I moved out of his way, but got behind him when I had to pass someone. This guy had dust and small dirt clumps flying out of the backend of his truck. All of a sudden a HUGE rock flew out the back and smashed my windshield. From my previous posts, you will know that I just replaced that thing. I was pissed. Since he is a person just driving down the road he can't be at fault, and was driving so fast, I couldn't get a license plate anyways, I can't get him for my deductible. Mother F**ker! There should be a law that you can't have shit in the backend of your truck uncovered to destroy other people's property, especially if you can't be reached to be held accountable. That shit just ain't cool.

        In my attempt to find out why I do what I do and who I am, I have discovered that I have more issues than I thought and it is going to take some time to get it all out. So I have decided to break it down piece by piece. It isn't going to mean anything to most that read this. I think I might even regret telling friends and family about this page. But this is free. Therapists cost money. Topics will include my mother, my siblings, middle school, high school, friends, and boys. The most heartbreaking topic will definately be the boys, so I will make sure to put a disclaimer on that one for my husband, who doesn't want to know that I ever had a boyfriend before I met him, and my mother who will think that is too much information than she ever wanted to know.  Now that I have that off my chest, I wanted to steer your attention to a very interesting site that I enjoyed very much. It is called   urlLink  Trite Crap   . Not everyone will agree with what this guy has to say, but it needs to be said, things need to be done, and it sounds good to me.

      I don't know all of the story on my father.  Some of this is just theory.  He is a 65 year old man who is stubborn, antagonistic, and unhealthy.  I love him just the way he is.  However, I want to try to understand where he came from and why he is the way he is. My father was the youngest of 2 children.  His parents were high school sweethearts that married and had my Uncle E.  Then 7 years later, they had my dad. My uncle was a sports master to the family.  My dad, apparently was just there. My theory on this is my grandfather didn't like kids.  He wanted one and one only.  He got his boy and raised him up to what he wanted.  Then they had the "miracle baby", my father.  This would explain why my father felt his father never appreciated him (like he does with my sister B) and why he is so special to his mother.  My father is somewhat of a momma's boy. Now, because he didn't get the love he wanted from his father, he acted out in ways of stealing, eating, and being rude.   To say that he has little tact when it comes to talking to his family sometimes is a little bit of an understatement. It is really unbelievable sometimes the things that come out of his mouth.  Can he really think this way? As for the unhealthy part, sadly, part of that is a family history that he can't shake.  However, he can take matters into his own hands and do something to prevent and maintain, instead of eating up all the ice cream, taco salad, and whatever else he can.  Part of the eating, I am sure is comfort.  His mom is a WONDERFUL cook.  She doesn't cook anymore, but when she did....DAMN it was good.  Since his mother loves him so much, and seriously is one of those women that shoved food in your face, I think he associates food with her love.  As a consequence to the gluttony, he has had numerous health issues, including diabetes and a heart attack.  He also has lung cancer from smoking for 30+ years, and that turned into a brain tumor they found in September 2002.  Despite all this, he is still around.  This is just a way of giving myself therapy, trying to figure out the people who raised me and learn how I came to be through who they are.  More to follow.
