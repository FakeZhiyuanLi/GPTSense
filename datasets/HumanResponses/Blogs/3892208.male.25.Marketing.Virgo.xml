       When I moved to the city back in Feb '03, it was a point in my life that I just needed a change.&nbsp; At that time, I was getting to be pretty anti-burbs and I was too excited to live in the city to think that I might even miss some things that the burbs had to offer.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  However, last night I had a little revelation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was driving to my parent's house to pick up some protein I ordered from   urlLink  www.allthewhey.com    (this place is great btw), and right before I got to the entrance of our subdivision, something hit me.....just a quick flashback or something of that nature, but it was pretty cool.&nbsp; As I rode down the little Frontage rd. that leads to their house, I passed the field that is followed by the lake in the backyard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Something just hit me, maybe it was the humidity and the scent of the cleaner suburban air, who knows what it was.&nbsp; Regardless of that, I just let that feeling come over me and it brought me back to all of those late summer nights and all the stupid shit I used to do when I had the summer off........not trying to dwell on the past, but that was a pretty easy time of life.&nbsp; I guess its just that maybe I was able to capture a moment in my mind, and it's so easy to pull that memory out and atleast bask in the short memory of who I was then and what I thought my future held.&nbsp; I know that someone out there that is reading this has the perfect comeback, she's saying "You need to stop looking at the past, Dan."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well ya know what?&nbsp;&nbsp; The past makes us who we are today; this isn't a question of living in the past, rather it is a subtle reminder of how much life can change and how we all think that there is always going to be something better out there for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holla at ya'boy!

       First off, I really hope that Mark Prior isn't out for the season.&nbsp; Secondly, Dooman, thanks for having me believe that Nomar was coming to the Cubbies..........ass.    &nbsp;  Back to me hating the mornings......Every morning it seems like I just want to sleep that extra 5 minutes, even though it won't do me any good.&nbsp; Starting off the day is such a routine process, physically of course.&nbsp; Mentally is a whole different story.&nbsp; The day before, I have done all I can to make sure that I am physically and mentally exhausted so that I don't think about that one thing that has been haunting my mind.&nbsp; However, when I wake up, I'm at my most basic state.&nbsp; I'm not thinking about work or my meal timing for the day or how I'm going to jack up my PR or my 6pm date with the CFC or what I am going to dress up as for the 80s party on Saturday.&nbsp; NO, I'm clouded by my inner thoughts and feelings and chances are that she had some small role in a dream I had last night.&nbsp; You can't stop the mind from wandering, at least, I can't.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  We used to walk these streets together and now I'm hoping that I'll never have to meet you. &nbsp; &nbsp;

        Your life at any time can become difficult.  Your life at any time can become easy.  It all depends upon how you adjust to life.  It's never the situation; it's your reaction to the situation.  You cannot always control your circumstances,  But you can control your own thoughts.  It's not your position but your disposition that matters.

      Okay another "wtf" thing:  wtf is up with this shitty clothing line?  I just took a short walk down the street and I must have seen 20 people wearing Hollister clothing....?  From my understanding, they are comprable as old navy is to Gap.  Why advertise that shit?  And to make it worse, the people wearing it were easily into their 20s and wearing this garbage.....get a fucking clue people, let the kids wear that stuff.  And don't get me started on Von Dutch or w/e the hell that is called.......sorry, but a $45 hat that probably costs $.20 to make is just a joke.   BABY JESUS LOVES ME .

      Just finished some Popeye's wings, spicy...good stuff. Why the hell is it not steaming hot outside, considering it is mid July? Downtown Chicago is pretty kick ass in the summer, I like the women that tend to dress a little more risque for their desk jobs, it gives me something to stare at as I walk down Madison ave and try to get my mind off the fact that women, as a whole, are not to be trusted(not you though Mom, I love ya!)......ALTHOUGH some of them should definitely keep covered up, that's for sure(yes, I'm talking to you, you large woman at the Citibank bldg......look, your huge flabby arms are bearable to look at, but I think it was the fact that your pale skin was totally peeling all over your black shirt....almost made me want to vomit(but I couldn't do that to myself, I'm wearing a nice shirt and I would have to go home and change). Speaking of shirts.....I'm having a problem now that I have been hitting the gym hard after a  nine month layoff : button downs do not conform to my body, either you have to be skinny as hell or really chubby to fit into them correctly....in 3 weeks, 3 of my shirts just don't fit right in the chest/back area....WTF?? I might have to only wear moo-moos or something until I'm back to my normal size, whatever that is.

      Okay, for some reason I couldn't get my blog to work all last night and this morning, until the whiz-kid Sean came back to work and changed the forces of the internet with his mad style and he got my shit up and running.    So this morning I am waiting on the L platform and the train is coming into the station...I look down quickly and my eyes lead to the stairwell...I see a long white skirt and calves that I could pick out of a lineup, running up the other side of the stairs....I'm about to board the train and I look to the back cars and low and behold....oh yes, it's her ---- good call on guessing that I'd be on the other side of the train this morning, otherwise we might have had to end up sitting with each other....AND we know how fun that would have been!!!  Almost as fun as trying to cross the street so that we don't even come in contact with each other....amazing.  Anyway, today is the two month anniversary of the last time I've had low-carb Lou Malnati's pizza.  It's really not bad tasting, it's just different.   Oh yeah, you might be wondering how I remember that?  Well, aside from the pizza, today is also 2 months from.........well, who cares.

      Well, I caught the first few innings of the All Star Game before my ass got up and went to the gym last night.....wtf was Sammy doing, he was making an ass out of himself in the first inning.  All star level right fielders would have made atleast one good catch out of those two that went to him...but wait, he makes up for it in hitting, right?? Yeah, I think Sammy needs to get back on the juice.  And Clemens...hahaha.  Way to get shelled for 6 runs in one inning, in your home stadium..........ass.

      As much as I would love to take credit for this work, it is not mine.  Rather, I found it one day and I've kept it bookmarked so I may read it when I feel like, well, shit.  Enjoy....  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Each human being is born as something new, something that never existed before. He is born with what he needs to win at life. Each person in his own way can see, hear, touch, taste, and think for himself. Each has his own unique potentials-his capabilities and limitations. Each can be significant, thinking, aware, and creatively productive person in his own right-a winner.   The words "winner" and "loser" have many meanings. When we refer to a person as a winner, we do not mean one who beats the other guy by winning over him and making him lose. To us, a winner is one who responds authentically by being credible, trustworthy, responsive, and genuine both as an individual and as a member of society. A loser is one who fails to respond authentically. Martin Buber expresses this idea as he retells an old story of a rabbi who on his death bed sees himself as a loser. The rabbi laments that, in the world to come, he will not be asked why he wasn't Moses; he will be asked why he wasn't himself.   Few people are one hundred percent winners or one hundred percent losers. It's a matter of degree. However, once a person is on the road to being a winner, his chances are greater for becoming even more so. This book is intended to facilitate the journey.   WINNERS   Winners have different potentials. Achievement is not the most important thing. Authenticity is. The authentic person experiences the reality of himself by knowing himself, being himself, and becoming a credible, responsive person. He actualizes his own unprecendented uniqueness and appreciates the uniqueness of others.   He does not dedicate his life to a concept of what he imagines he should be, rather he is himself and as such he does not use his energy putting on a performance, maintaining pretence, and manipulating others into his games. A winner can reveal himself instead of projecting images that please, provoke, or entice others. He is aware that there is a difference between being loving and able and acting loving, between being stupid and acting stupid, between being knowledgeable and acting knowledgeable. He does not need to hide behind a mask. He throws off unrealistic self-images of inferiority or superiority. Autonomy does not frighten a winner.   Everyone has moments of autonomy, if only fleeting. However, a winner is about to sustain his autonomy over ever-increasing periods of time. He may lose ground occasionally. He may even fail. Yet, in spite of setbacks a winner maintains a basic faith in himself.   A winner is not afraid to do his own thinking and to use his own knowledge. He can separate facts from opinion and doesn't pretend to have all the answers. He listens to others, evaluates what they say, but comes to his own conclusions. While he can admire and respect other people, he is not totally defined, demolished, bound or awed by them.   A winner does not play "helpless" nor does he play the blaming game. Instead he assumes responsibility for his own life. He does not give others a false authority over him. He's his own boss and knows it.   A winner's timing is right. He responds appropriately to the situation. His response is appropriate when it is related to the message sent and preserves the significance, worth, well-being, and dignity of the people involved. He knows that for everything there is a season and for every activity a time.   A time to be aggressive and a time to be passive, A time to be together and a time to be alone,   A time to fight and a time to love,   A time to work and a time to play,   A time to cry and a time to laugh,   A time to confront and a time to withdraw,   A time to speak and a time to be silent,   A time to hurry and a time to wait.   To a winner time is precious. He doesn't kill it. He lives it here and now. Living in the now does not mean that he foolishly ignores his own past history or fails to prepare for his future. Rather, he knows his past, is aware and alive in the present, and looks forward to the future.   A winner learns how to know his feelings and his limitations and is not afraid of them. He is not stopped by his own contradictions and ambivalences. He knows when he is angry and can listen when others are angry with him. He can give and receive affection. He is able to love and be loved.   A winner can be spontaneous. He does not have to respond in predetermined, rigid ways. He can change his plans when the situation calls for it. A winner has a zest of life. He enjoys work, play, food, other people, sex, and the world of nature. He enjoys his own accomplishments. Without envy he enjoys the accomplishments of others.   Although a winner can freely enjoy himself, he can also postpone enjoyment. He can discipline himself in the present to enhance his enjoyment in the future. He is not afraid to go after what he wants but does so in appropriate ways. He does not get his security by controlling others. He does not set himself up to lose.   A winner cares about the world and its peoples. He is not isolated from the general problems of society. He is concerned, compassionate, and committed to improving the quality of life. Even in the face of national and international adversity, he does not see himself as totally powerless. He does what he can to make the world a better place.   LOSERS   Although people are born to win, they are also born helpless and totally dependent on their environment. Winners successfully make the transition from total helplessness to independence, and then to interdependence. Losers do not. Somewhere along the line they begin to avoid becoming self-responsible.   As we have noted, few people are total winners or losers. Most of them are winners in some areas of their lives and losers in others. Their winning or losing is influenced by what happens to them in childhood.   A lack of response to dependency needs, poor nutrition, brutality, unhappy relationships, disease, continuing disappointments, inadequate physical care, and traumatic experiences that contribute to making people losers. Such experiences interrupt, deter, or prevent the normal progress toward autonomy and self-actualization. To cope with negative experiences a child learns to manipulate himself and others. These manipulative techniques are hard to give up later in life and often become set patters. A winner works to shed them. A loser hangs on to them.   Some losers speak of themselves as successful but anxious, successful but trapped, or successful but unhappy. Others speak of themselves as totally beaten, without purpose, unable to move, half dead, or bored to death. A loser may not recognize that, for the most part, he has been building his own cage and digging his own grave, and is a bore to himself.   A loser seldom lives in the present. He destroys the present by occupying his mind with past memories or future expectations.   When the loser lives in his past, he dwells on the good old days or on his past misfortunes. Nostalgically, he either clings to the way things "used to be" or bemoans his bad luck. He feels sorry for himself and shifts the responsibility for his unsatisfactory life onto others. Blaming others and excusing himself are often part of his games. A loser who lives in the past may lament if only:   If only I had married some one else…   If only I had a different job…   If only I had finished school…   If only I had been handsome (beautiful)…   If only my spouse had stopped drinking…   If only I had been born rich…   If only I had better parents…   When a person lives in the future he may dream of some miracle after which he can "live happily ever after." Rather than pursuing his own life, he waits-waits for the magical rescue. How wonderful life will be when:   When school is over…   When Prince Charming or the ideal woman finally comes…   When the kids grow up…   When that new job opens…   When the boss dies…   When my ship comes in…   In contrast to those who live with the delusion of a magical rescue, some losers live constantly under the dread of future catastrophe. They conjure up expectations of what if:   What if I lose my job…   What if I lose my mind…   What if something falls on me…   What if I break my leg…   What if they don't like me…   What if I make a mistake…   By continually focusing on the future, a person experiences anxiety in the present. He is anxious over what he anticipates-either real or imagined-tests, bill paying, a love affair, crisis, illness, retirement, the weather, and so forth. A person overly involved with imaginings lets the actual possibilities of the moment pass him by. He occupies his mind with material that is irrelevant to the current situation. His anxiety tunes out current reality. Consequently, he is unable to see for himself, hear for himself, feel for himself, or taste, touch, or think for himself.   Unable to bring the full potential of his senses into the immediate situation, a loser's perceptions are incorrect or incomplete. He sees himself and others through a prismlike distortion. His ability to deal effectively with the real world is hampered.   A loser spends much of his time play-acting. He pretends, manipulates, and perpetuates old roles from childhood. He invests his energy in maintaining his masks, often projecting a phony front. Karen Horney writes, "The fostering of the phony self is always at the expense of the real self, the latter being treated with disdain, and best like a poor relative." To the play-acting loser, his performance is often more important than his reality.   A loser represses his capacity to express spontaneously and appropriately his full range of possible behavior. He may be unaware of other options for his life if the path he chooses goes nowhere. He is afraid to try new things. He maintains his own status quo. He is a repeater. He repeats not only his own mistakes; he often repeats those of his family and culture.   A loser has difficulty giving and receiving affection. He does not enter into intimate, honest, direct relationships with others. Instead, he tries to manipulate them into living up to his expectations and channels his energies into living up to their expectations.   When a person is being a loser, he is not using his intellect appropriately. He is misusing it by rationalizing and intellectualizing. When rationalizing, he gives excuses to make his actions seem plausible. When intellectualizing, he tries to snow others with his verbiage. Consequently, much of his potential remains dormant, unrealized, and unrecognized. Like the frog-prince in the fairy tale, he is spellbound and lives life being something he isn't meant to be.

      Even though some of our roster has decided to leave, the Midwest All Stars are still able to win games.&nbsp; Last night, we took out one of our obnoxious rivals and won the game 5-1.&nbsp; Little did I know that it was the first round of the playoffs..........   After the game, my boy Rick asked me if I wanted to go see one of our friends from good old Knox College perfom at an open mic night.&nbsp; I figured 'hey, why not?&nbsp; Thursday nights seem to be fun and I need to do something'.&nbsp; So we go.&nbsp; Good times!&nbsp; Even though there was really not much of a crowd there, Chris and Curt were more than entertaining.&nbsp; Actually, I had no idea who Curt was but then Chris gave me his guitar and I played and sang a few songs w/Curt.......between songs, we chatted and he told me he went to Knox for a year but moved to Chicago and goes to UIC....after deducing all this info, I realized who he was....he's good friends with Karen aka 'Kare Bear', I remember her telling me about him.&nbsp; Anyway, he's a cool guy and I'll probably go there next week and play again.&nbsp; Songs we played:&nbsp; Ghost, Clarity, Man On The Side, No Woman No Cry, and My Stupid Mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Times!   So that ended, Rick and I decided we needed more so we went to McGee's($1 Bottles WUT WUT!), they closed down and we weren't done yet............there was only one other place to go............................... TY's!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow that place is lame, although sometimes you can get lucky and have a good time there.&nbsp; Not last night though, but it was still nice to do something to get&nbsp;my mind completely of you know what.&nbsp; God bless ya Rick!

      Rough day, I really beat myself up last night.&nbsp; It's worth it, or so I keep telling myself.  &nbsp;  It seems that the key to getting your mind off of something(for me anyway) is to just exhaust yourself mentally and then physically.&nbsp; This way, there is no time to give a shit about&nbsp;how&nbsp;I'm really feeling, I'm too drained to give a rat's ass about Jen at that point.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  By the time I am home and done doing all the stuff that encompasses my day,&nbsp;it's already 10pm.&nbsp; And even when I am home, I still have to make dinner.&nbsp; I need a cook.&nbsp; This is 4 days out of the week, so it's good to be able to not have to deal with any thoughts&nbsp;that might&nbsp;would otherwise be racing through my head.&nbsp; If I didn't&nbsp;start going back to the&nbsp;gym with such&nbsp;intensity, things would be alot worse than they are now.  Still, you can't trust anything that someone, no matter how genuine you think they are, tells you.  I can call it heartless because thats what it is, that is how I was treated, like a fucking doormat, thats me.    &nbsp;  I love the gym culture.&nbsp; No matter where yours&nbsp;may be, they&nbsp;all have the same characteristics:&nbsp;&nbsp;The ex&nbsp;h.s/college football players who&nbsp;are&nbsp;even chubbier than they were in their prime, most have an asshole attitude and usually&nbsp;workout with a partner and make references to "Remember that solo tackle I made in 1995 in the state playoffs?" or the likes....The old guy who likes to read the paper in between&nbsp;his 30 sets on the leg extension machine.....the fat guy who&nbsp;is super strong and does nothing but bench press.....the cardio queens who think that if&nbsp;they run for just 20 more minutes, the hail damage will disappear and they will be good enough to find their&nbsp;early-to-mid 30s stud with the big bank account(they wonder why their legs keep getting bigger though......hmm).....the really skinny guy who just doesn't seem to ever grow(until he finds some chemical assistance from the next guy--->).....the very muscular guy with all kinds of silly tatoos who&nbsp;tries hitting on the hot receptionist....ALL the people that spend 45 minutes doing the most pointless&nbsp;workout for their body(abs....c'mon now, you don't even really need to do them....you need to diet!).....and of course, there is the old guy in the&nbsp;locker room........if you are a guy, chances are you have seen him or one of his relatives.&nbsp; He doesn't ever workout, but rather he likes to sit there all day with his old balls and loose skin on display for the world to see....hey old man, go home already!  &nbsp;  I don't know where I fall into this whole thing; maybe I'm a mixture of all of them, but I know that I'm way to focused to ever really acknowledge anyone or anything for the short time I am there.&nbsp; Throw on the iPod and drown out the world and focus on change, focus on improvement.&nbsp; It really isn't that hard, you just have to know what you are trying to accomplish.&nbsp; There is such a high&nbsp;I get when I walk out of there,&nbsp;nothing could bring me down for the rest of the night.&nbsp; Maybe that is what's keeping me going right now, because&nbsp;with all of the bullshit and deceit&nbsp;I have been subjected to lately, not even that can take me off this high.  &nbsp;  I have to admit, once in a blue moon will&nbsp;I see someone that&nbsp;seems to be on the same page as me when I'm there. Moravek used to be that girl.&nbsp; It happened last night, and it was a female.&nbsp; She was pushing weights and she knew what she was doing, and she was in great shape.&nbsp; Small waist and hips, muscular legs but not gross looking, good vasularity, very feminine, tan but&nbsp;not super tan, strong, gorgeous.......sexy.&nbsp;&nbsp;  If I didn't feel like such a failure in the relationships/understanding/trusting women&nbsp;department, I probably would have&nbsp;made an attempt.&nbsp; But then again, who likes to get hit on at the gym anyway?&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

And guess what, being a heartless liar isn't very attractive either.  Thanks for making me not believe or trust anything I hear anymore.

      I really couldn't tell you.&nbsp; When it comes to getting ready to go out, I am so lazy.&nbsp; I am sure that it is a learned behavior, just being around that makes you eventually that way, too.&nbsp; However, I definitely learned how to waste as much time as possible in the process, and I've gotten pretty good at it!&nbsp; It used to hard liquor(stored in a water bottle) and some random mix that fueled the process, and&nbsp;now it's beer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Love the previews, hate the movies.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So when I reached my first destination, for some reason it switched from beer to vodka/red bull.&nbsp; Big mistake, I knew it was going to be a long night.&nbsp; The 80s party went as planned, good crowd, plenty of people dressed up for it.&nbsp; Got to see Paul and Bob, they came in from out of town.&nbsp; Jacqui looked classic, she even cut her bangs.&nbsp; I'll get pictures up on here as soon as they are sent to me.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I think I saw Ricky last night but I'm not sure what time that was.&nbsp; Didn't get much sleep last night but that happens sometimes.  &nbsp;  I can't play&nbsp;guitar when I'm not sober.&nbsp; My neighbors have to know this by now.  &nbsp;  Now the sleep schedule is all messed up, I should be in bed by now.....The weather was so gorgeous today that I couldn't spend it in bed, so I did the next&nbsp;logical thing:&nbsp;I went to the park to lay there and&nbsp;read for a little while before I drove to my grandmothers house.&nbsp; That didn't really work out so well, and ended up with me taking a pretty long walk around the area.&nbsp; It was kinda nice, maybe I should buy a bike.&nbsp;   Right now I am sitting here and I'm looking at my&nbsp;fish and I can't think of his name.&nbsp; I didn't name him, somebody else did.&nbsp; For real, I can't think of his name.  &nbsp;

         When we live with resentment toward another our hearts close down. Letting go of our resentment frees us from placing blame on them and allows us to look toward ourself for peace. Still, in the end it does not justify the action. What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ~Ralph Waldo Emerson

      Music...Nothing like music to capture a moment, maybe its just an innate ablity I possess that lets me remember certain things.&nbsp; This may be bad, it may be good.&nbsp; I can think of hundreds of times that music has lent itself to a certain situation or high point or low point in my past.   Take Sat night for instance.&nbsp; I'm hanging out with someone that tells me they are a fan of the Indigo Girls, so I throw some on.....big mistake.&nbsp; After about the 3rd song, I get a flashback.......YOU'RE BAGS ARE AT THE TARTANA!!!&nbsp; I get this flashback to the hour long singalong to any Indigo Girls song that was available at that moment in the hotel room, which kinda ruined the mood for me this weekend.   If you haven't already, now would be a good time to enter in a "you need to stop living in the past, Dan."   And to that, I say "fuck&nbsp;that".&nbsp; Movies have soundtracks, no reason why I can't have my own.

        urlLink     Just wanted to take a moment to think of my grandfather and all he gave to everyone in his life, I can't believe it's been two years since he was taken from us.  We love you, Dziadz.  And on a different note:  How is it that the only picture I find of my grandfather on the Internet is one of him standing over a Nazi soldier that he most likely killed about 30 minutes before this picture was taken?  R.I.P.

      So the driver came to pick us up at 6, show started at 8 but we figured we could drink and hangout there for an hour or so before he came out to play...    urlLink     After several rounds of $8 beers and several trips to the bathroom, it was time for the show to begin........      urlLink      2nd row seats, damn. I didn't even need to use the zoom on the camera for that pic of him, we were so damn close to the stage. We were right there, good times! For real, I'm pretty sure I was getting out of hand, even worse than  "PLAY MILLION DOLLAR$!" . Mayer doesn't get his props as a guitarist, but he should b/c he can play his ass off! Best date ;) EVER!!  I was planning on meeting someone for his private show at Shuba's afterwards, but I literally passed out in the car on the way back. Our driver was totally south side, but God bless her for letting us rip 'em! I guess the show afterwards was awesome, all blues and only one of his originals. It didn't matter, the concert was plenty for me.     And also, Keith Urban rules. Take your space and take your reasons, but You'll Think Of Me.
