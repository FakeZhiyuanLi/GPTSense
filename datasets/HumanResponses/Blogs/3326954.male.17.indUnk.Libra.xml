        Hey you guys!! I love the weekends!  IT ALWAYS means more time with my girl!! The only bad part of the weekend is that in the first few hours of the day i do more work than i do in a normal week at school! But it is always worth while in the end when i get to see the beautiful!! Lets see well today I got up around 10:30 and i started cleaning up the house! Once that was done the family (minus josh who was at work) headed to home depot to get some stuff to work on the house with! When we got back i had to clean out this whole room that had LOADS of meaningless stuff in it! Then i had to organinse the room! After the room was all finished I took a REALLY quick shower and rushed to my babys house to pick her up!! We came back to my house and played a countless number of games of pool! From there we went to show choir then we came back to my house! She is so awesome! We played even more pool and watched a movie!!! SO much fun with my girl! Well then i dropped her off at her house!! Then i got an unexpected phone call! IT WAS MY BABY!!! she said she missed me and i was VERY vary to get a call because I missed her too!! Tomorrow I get to work until two then im picking up christy and we are hanging out from 2 to until her mommy gets home!!! SO MUCH FUN!! This week is going to be so much fun!! PKI, Blink 182 AND prom! PLUS i have the best girlfriend EVER! what  more can i ask for!!!  Im the luckiest guy to ever live!                                             -The Andy-

         Hey ALL!!  Today was quite possibly the slowest day of the week, it wasn't really a bad day just kinda slow and long!  We really didn't do anything in any of our classes at all! School just seems so pointless right now! But finally this week has come to an end! I thought this week was going to suck from the start and well overall it wasn't all that good! Just kinda boring! We never did nething in class! Not that im complaining its just that i got REALLY bored! Next week is going to be very exciting! I can't wait!!! The begining of the week will prolly be really slow like this week was because ill be waiting for wednesday and thursday and well the weekend to get here! Wednesday all of the physics classes get to go to Kings Island! That will be awesome! I will be with my girl prolly almost the whole day!! Then on thursday the BEST BAND IN THE WORLD blink 182 is going to be at riverbend! AND I HAVE TICKETS  TO SEE THEM!!!!!!!!!! go andy! Friday i dunno i forget what friday is other than the night before prom! And well saturday is prom and ill get to be with my baby ALL NIGHT!!! YAY! I know we will have fun because we always have fun together! Well i was hoping that this post would take awhile to do bc im just so bored right now and im  trying to think of ways to pass the time until Choir! Once that is over the REAL fun starts!  I get to go to hang out with the best girl in the world! YAY FOR ANDY!!! well thats all i have to say!                                     -The luckiest guy to ever live-

Well lets see it all started with me getting up a little late and rushing out the dorr to get to school!! (when don't i wake up a little late!!) Then we had percussion class which wasn't that bad bc we just sat there all bell and did nothing! Christy and Alicia built things with legos!! WHAT LOSERS!! just kidding they are two awesome people! Well then i had Pre-Calc which sucked as usual! The only decent part of the bell were the first 5 minutes! I was in good company! My girlfriend was with me!!! Well then I went on to AP US and Physics!! WE NEVER DO NETHING IN THOSE CLaSSES!!! but you won't hear me complaining! Then we had Pre-AP english which was fun bc i just played on the computer the whole time! And i typed up part of a paper! Lunch was ok i guess bc i got to do two of my favorite things eat food and see someone special!  Then Jazz Band sucked bc i had to go play for the middle school! oh well one bad bell in't that bad! Spanish flew by! Then i came home and cleaned for about an hour! time flew and well to end the day my chrisy came over! We had fun! we basically just played pool talked and made plans for prom and watched tv it was good time!!! Well here i am now writing this!! I guess today was good overall which is good bc ive been having a bad week! Well I guess thats all! See you all later!                                             -The Andy-

        Hey you guys!!!  Its been a little while since i have posted on my blog!! not really all that long prolly just a few days!! Anyway! Yesterday Physics went to Kings Island!! We were only at the school until 7:55!!! And my first bell is percusson so that was fun!!! We watched Harry Potter! (and today too!!) IT WAS SO MUCH FUN!!! We rode The Beast, Son of Beast, Vortex, The Swings AND the Viking ship!  we had plenty of time to ride more but we were tired of walking around bc it was really hot so we just layed down for a while and just talk! It was good times!!! Then our bus was nearly an hour late! :( oh well its over now!! When we got back to the school Christy and I went to pick up my Tux and then we dropped it off at my house! Then we headed to the awards banquet to help set up but y were already done with the set-up!  So then we watched awards and had fun just acting stupid! After the awards i stayed with my girl to help clean-up then i went home! I had an awesome day!!! And for some reason today i was in a bad mood and i don't know why but i think i mught have an idea! Oh well that was over half way through the day today! Now im getting really hyper just sitting here waiting on christy to get here and then after she is gone joshy-pooh and I are going to watch my FAVORITE BAND LIVE!!! Thats right Blink 182 is at riverbend!! Wooh Wooh!!! And as if that weren't enough Taking Back Sunday is ALSO in the concert along with the used!!! it should be the best concert of my life!! I am going to have another great night!! And then tomorrow im going to watch adam's baseball game and then with the ralstins to Erin's (christy and adams cousin) graduation party!! then of course saturaqdy is prom!! I CAN'T WAIT!!

        Hey you guys!! It is tuesday and by far the worst day of the week for me this week! I had a not so great day at school for some reason, not sure why but i did. I think just knowing that i was going to be lonely and that i had to work when schooll was over just made me hate the day!  The ONLY good part of the day was time spent with my girl... I know it sounds weird to say that and prolly doesn't even seem like i mean it... but i definitely do! Is that sad? I dunno! Oh well its the truth!! Then at work my girl came to say hi! even though it was only for 5 seconds it was still the best five seconds of my night!  Then after i got off work i went to surprise her by going to see her concert!  Well i attempted to surprise her but she said she knew i would come to see her! Well i guess she was right but it is kinda sad that she knew i was coming to see her even though i told her that there was no way i could make it!! I try to surprise her a lot and well i guess she is just expecting it now! THAT MAKES IT TOO HARD FOR ME TO SURPRISE HER!!!! neway! Yeah today totally blew! Tomorrow SHOULD be fun! I hope it is! I guess ill find out soon enough! Thursday is going to rock! I get to see Blink 182 AND Taking Back Sunday AND the Used at riverbend! Then this weekend will be awesome too! Well i guess this was another POINTLESS post just because i know no one reads this STUPID blog and it is just a way for me to indirectly talk to myself!                                  SEE YOU LATER ANDY!                                     BYE ANDY!!!                                       -The Andy-

        Hey you guys!! Its time for another pointless post that way i have more to read because i know no one else ever reads this!!! YAY!! Oh well! I still like to write about my day! YAY!! Well lets see what made today SO great! There is only one real reason that today was so great!! Any guesses... anyone... maybe not? ok neway id just like to point out what a loser i am before i continue!! Im A LOSER!!! ok with that said im going to attepmt to describe what i did today withOUT getting myself off topic!! Ok! Well i got up for school ON TIME today! not that that makes life great or nething but it was kinda nice to get to relax and eat breakfast for once!! Then i went to school which is ALWAYS a joy! Not really but lately i haven't dreaded going thanks to someone special!  once i got to school I did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING (sing it again! (sorry im a loser)) Thats right i did nothing in school today! Funny thing is that even if the teachers attempted to make us work i couldn't have because guess who lost their bookbag!! thats right but its ok it somehow suddenly reapeared in the choir room half way through the day! with lots of stuff missing from it! lol j/k but it really did show up later so i know where IT is now!!! YAY! but ill forget by morning but just incase i do forget its in my trunk not that neone will read this EVER! lol neway after my countless pointless hours of school i got to come home! YAY! Then when i got home i didn't have to clean up much! bc i cleand up last night after christy left! so that was nice! so then my baby came over and we playd pool and watched tv until she had to leave at 5:30 then i went and hung out with my girl at afterschool band! I know it doesn't sound like an exciting day but it really was great! bc i spent lots of it with my girl plus i dunno other people (and i won't mention names) coughaliciacough were also having a great day so that is always good! well i guess thats all for now! Ill write more for myself to read later!!                                       -Luckiest Guy EVER-

        Hey you guys! Today was very fun!! I went to sleep lastnight at about 2 am! Then i woke up at 7:15 and couldn't fall back asleep! I finally went to work at 10 and got out at 2! From there i went to Christys to pick her up! We went to my cousins b-day party and then came back to the house to hang out! We played pool as usual! Its was fun! Then we ate dinner and played more pool then we played cards and then it was time again for more pool!!! I felt really bad because i was getting really tired!! I don't think i made it that much fun for her but she said she had a great time!! I felt so bad that i was not a lot of fun! I know she couldn't have had THAT much fun! But i still hope she did neway!  I did even though i was about to fall asleep! This is yet again another pointless post!! YAY i like them that way! IF YOU WANT REAL INFORMATION ON ME YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK!!! lol i dunno why i even have a blog i never put ne useful information in here and i doubt that neone even ever reads it! the people who do read it prolly already know what i did all day and thats all they ever get from this! LOL!!! well neway like i said im getting really tired! AND IM NOT ready for school tomorrow! so im going to go sit and watch TV now!! See you all soon!

        Hey you guys! Im so bored right now!!! Im just sitting in fifth period and i guess this post just goes to showhow pointless my being at school this week really has been! Ive slept in almost every single class today and if i wasn't sleeping i was playing cards or just being bored!!! Fun stuff... really!  Last night was a lot of fun! Christy and i hung out! Half at her house half at mine! It was def. one of the best nights we've had together up to this point! So much fun! We were so hyper!  Anyway... tonight is graduation... can you say boring??? well after that christy's mom is picking us up to take us to Erin's (Christy and adams cousin) graduation party! Tomorrow i only have to be here for one exam!!! Then its a three day weekend and i can't wait!!!!!!!!!! so yeah i wish school was over already that way i could go home!!!  I haven't posted in awhile i just realized (i dunno why i sayed that)  Drumline is finally starting again and i think we could be pretty good this year if everyone works hard! We stil;l haven't officially set the line but we will soon! We already have two parts of the four that there are in the score for this season!!! So thats real exciting! Not really im just bored and have nothing to talk about!!!! Well its ime to go to next bell so i have to end this pointless post! :(  oh well! See you kids later!                          -The luckiest Guy EVER-

       Hey you guys! I like hardly ever post in here! but thats prolly just because no one ever reads it lol!  I say that everytime i post in this, in one way or another! lol ne-who today has been good so far but its about to get really bad :( and thats bc i have to work 2-10! Poor andy! Oh well i will just bethinking about the fact that i am off work tomorrow and that i get to see my baby like all day or at least for a large majority of it!! So that is always exciting!  Lets see... today i woke up at about 8:15 and the first person i talked to or even saw was christy at about 8:45! Then we took a nap until about 10 at which time we took josh to work! Then we came back here and ate and played a little pool and talked a lot! It was really a good time, but time always flies by when im with her and i just know that the next 8 hours are to going to seem and eternity! I will try to post more often though that way one day when im bored i have something to read! THAT WILL BE FUN! LOL not! well im off to work with a bunch of losers aty krogers have a nice day everyone!            -Andy-

        Hey All!!  GUESS WHAT!!! NOBODY READS THIS!!! SO I CAN SAY ANYTHING I WANT TO! But i won't because what if i someday become a friendly person and people decide to rad my blog... they don't need to know what im thinking about right now do they!!! Well what have i done since school got out? NOT TOO MUCH ACTUALLY! Ive hung out with friends, worked and saw my beautiful a lot!  Other than that nothing exciting has really happened! I can't wait for the vacations! I get to go with christy to Myrtle Beach and she get to come with my family on a house boat! Hers will be more exciting i think! Ne-who whats up with all you guys?? what have you done this summer?  Oh yeah i went shopping at the school on the teachers last day! It was fun! WASN'T IT ALICIA!         -The Andy-
