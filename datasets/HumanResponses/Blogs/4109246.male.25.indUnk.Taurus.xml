      If you are going to disagree with my point, please do so without hiding behind some sort of anonymous "handle". I am open to debate any of my opinions, but do so without trying to hide and come right out and "tell me to my face" so to speak. Also, attacks at my "stature" or my spiritual beliefs will not be tolerated. I am not the issue here, the current administration of these United States is.

      I highly suggest that everyone go out and pick up a copy of "Crimes Against Nature" by Robert F Kennedy, Jr. It is a very insightful look at just how much damage King George has caused. Plus, it really pissed off Sean Hannity. That has to be worth something.

      In an effort to further confuse the puppy that is the people of the United States, he puts us in a Code Orange Alert (pretty color eh?) and then proceeds to tell us to move along and do what we normally do.   So go to Disneyland, but be sure to wear a gasmask.  Go on a picnic, but don't forget to Duck & Cover.  If you are staying in, be sure to duct tape your house shut.  In the case of a pile of bullshit, be sure to come back here for more of the truth.  We can't live in fear, and that is what our current administration is banking on. Scaring us so badly that we wouldn't dare do anything to make him leave office, you know, like voting for someone else.  I remember I signed a petition for them to get rid of their feeble attempts to make Homosexual marrige illeagl, and a friend said to me, "You know if Bush is re-elected we are the first ones going to Iraq." As scary as that sounds, I don't think he is far from the truth.

      So times they are a changin' but yet we have conservative folks like Dubya who can't get past his pure hatred for the gay people in the US and see that he is destroying basic human rights. I knew it wouldn't make it past the Senate. I called  my  senators and told them to vote no, and it would seem that they did just that.  The real problem with the world today is people just sit by and don't want to do anything to bring about change. They leave "well enough alone" and hope that someone else will stand up and take care of it for them.  WE NEED TO STAND UP!!   You can call me a conspiracy theorist, but you know when George said that if there is a terrorist attack in October, they would postpone the elections? I hate to say it, and I can hear the federales a'knockin at my door right now, but look for something else to happen that might rival that of 9/11. I don't want anything to happen, I chant daily that nothing does happen. (Yes, I am a practicing Buddhist. One of those things that George would have a hard time understanding in the Land of the Free). We just need to understand the lengths that the GOP will go to, just to make sure that Kerry and Edwards don't get into office and bring back something that looks like a civilized government.  Come Nov. 3rd if King George is still in charge,  I might have to start playing hockey and drinking shitty beer.
