            Preparation and mediation of Chat session       A chat session is synchronous, in other words «live » so the structure, duration and objectives of a chat session should be determined before it occurs. A (tutor) should have the responsiblity of mediation  in order to keep track of the speed of the exchanges, students’ participation and the outcome of the task.    Preparation of Chat session  Arrange a date, time, duration of the sessions, inform participants and ivite them to confirm their attendance. Limit the number of participants with regards to the type of activity ; for e.g. create several chat rooms of groups of 5 to 6 students so they can actively exchange information and work collaboratively. The following is important : ·         Plan the introduction of the participants at the beginning of the session ·         Introduce the objectives, topics and decisions to make before the session starts ·         Identify the different stages of the topics (topics, sub-topics, synthesis, etc..) ·         Plan the end of the session (a few minutes) Send a Chat session plan beforehand, by e-mail.   Mediation of a Chat session  The « mediator »  conducts the session and helps participants achieve their objectives. He/she facilates participation, stimulates interaction while taking into account students socio-affective idiosynchracies. To facilitates and maintain students’ interests  ·         Give instructions before the session starts ( topic intro)  : Rote participation during formal discussions – make sure everyone has a go Ask participants to tell when they decide to leave or end the conversation Tell the participant to respect the planned structure of the session Tell the participants to respect other participants’s ideas and general rules of conduct Ensure, at the beginning of the session, that  everyone understands the targeted topics and objectives, the structure of the session and adjust information if need be Facilitate exchanges with brief interventions Give students time to familarise with the technology Ask brief questions at the beginning of the session to break the ice Don’t put too much emphasis on the quality of language used and the objectives, the session structure since student participation is most important Allow everyone to express themselves and if necessary, demand that each individual particpate ; ensure that active students allow shy students to also have a go at sharing their ideas Contact individually and quickly a student who threatens to interfere with the session objectives or does not respect the rules of conduct Summarize at each objective stage of the process, the outcome of the objectives and waht should be the next step Regulary step in to make a short summary with the most important points discussed or ask additional questions if need be Introduce opposite opinions to facilitate the discussion et particpation Name a conversation leader if need be and rote leadership Encourage metacommunication (how the session is going, how the participant are actually participating, etc..) Beware with humour since it can easily become sarcasm in multicultural chat session.    What is the appropriate language register in a chat session ?    Write clear and simple sentences Keep sentences short and close to the topic Use precise but simple verbs in the active voice if possible Use open questions to obtain open answers Use smileys ;-) to give a tone to the intervention Intensify exchanges with the use of acronyms (BRB, ASAP) Bare in mind participants’ affective behaviour? Be there at all times and read all interventions Respect everyone’s difference, show that you are behind everyone, particulary those who need more attention that others Help students develop a positive perception of their participation with postivie retroactive remarks on their production Some students will be afraid of making fools of themselves with bad content, spelling or grammar mistakes. Individual encouragement during the session is useful Know your students invite them to introduce themselves in the beginning, or make a short message about themselves before sending it Do not hesitate to make contact with students individually if they ask a question or make a comment so the others can get on with the session  Keep a low profile unless the session does not go as planned Try to find acronyms in the language you teach… as well to give your students they will love it ! (lol)
