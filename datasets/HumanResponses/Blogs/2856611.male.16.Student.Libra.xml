      I would launch into my past days which included Xav and Nick destroying my room, icing sugar, Charli and a big fuck-off Turky... okay the last ones a lie... I think. Anyhow, yes, I WOULD talk about that but in spirit of Xav Live Journal I am going to take the easy way out...  1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says: "to find out if the user accepts of rejects your"  2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first? Well... the end of my desk but object would be the Sky Digital box.  3: What is the last thing you watched on TV? "Mr. Bean: The Animated Series"  4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what time it is: 9:33am  5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?: 9:24am... WOAH! I should be in school right now!  6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?: A fan blowing air throughout my room... not that exciting really.  7: When did you last step outside? what were you doing? Last night, I went to the cinema with Charli to see 'Win A Date With Tad Hamilton' and let me tell you, Tad Hamilton is NO Rhys James.  8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at? Xav and Cool Kates journals  9: What are you wearing? Pyjama's... dear god wheres my school uniform!?  10: Did you dream last night? I can never remember these things... so Im going with probably, yes.  11: When did you last laugh? ... ... last night I guess, can't remeber at what but I know I did.  12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?: Um. Blue paint, Kurt Cobain posters, a Linkin Park poster and a Canadian Flag. Oooh! and Plug Sockets!  13: Seen anything weird lately?: Heh yeah... my brothers friend Sam  14: What do you think of this quiz?: ... Its taken more time than It would to discuss the past days... certainly NOT the easy way out.  15: What is the last film you saw?: Win A Date With Tad Hamilton  16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?: Bill Gates... no um, yeah an Education... no probably nothing, I'd keep it and live my life as normal, I would probably buy a computer with a ginormous amount of memory for entertainment use.  17: Tell me something about you that I don't know: Im meant to wear glasses.  18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?: Probably just have better grass... so it felt nice to sit on... and more sunny weather.  19: Do you like to dance?:  I doubt it...  20: George Bush: Fuck Mook:  21a: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?: Dharma (Dar-ma), from the TV show Dharma and Greg.  21b: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?: Despite the fact my wife/partner would hate it and the kid would get picked on by kids and the religeous churches - Jesus  22: Would you ever consider living abroad?: Yeah... Canada  Okay done and done... so long...

      Yesterday was not a bad day! Wahay! Me and Charli are back together, she phoned this morning agree'd that we wanted to be back together so Im so god damn happy about that. Anyhow back to yesterday, well I got my hair cut, and It's not bad but It's not great I miss my old hair to be honest with you, alright It was long and curly and kind of annoying but it was possibly THE greastest hair style I had ever had, kept me so warm and It got to a point where I could'nt do anything with it so I didn't care what people thought, now It's alot shorter and gay-er but hey I cant spike it so Im good you know? After that I went home and spoke to Charli online at which point we were still on a break we talked about general stuff nothing that had happened and to be honest it felt good, I liked it, made me feel so much happier and at the end she said she might want to see me (but that doesn't matter now were together again) and yeah she said she felt better now she talked to me. So yeah then I went to meet Hans for Coffee's yet we didn't get Coffee's, we sat in Roath Park for a while and talked about stuff and then went investigating alleys, looking at graphiti and such, so many Crew's in Cardiff, Examples: Roath Ryderz, Penylan Posse, Splott Cru and there are quite alot of Mash Up's which me and Hans think is some sort of Mash Potatoe competition. Anyhow we then went to a corner shop and got some sugary items and ate them, icing sugar, cookies, drinks, choc dips and sugar puffs. We took those and sat on the steps of a church and ate them mixing the drinks, sugar puffs and icing sugar together which was very hyperactive, the cookies were fucking awful so we lined them up across the road and let cars drive over them. With any left over icing sugar we did a MASSIVE art attack in Roath Park it was the ghost of Mr. T which was cool and Xav and Lee said they could see it so me and Hans were proud, she then left and me Xav and Lee went to Nicks were I ate a steak and an easter egg, popped some balloons and then me and Nick had a cucumber fight outside which was awful... didn't go to plan AT all. Then we went to the cinema which I was pretty much screwed as it was a late showing and I wasn't meant to be home late but yeah we saw Shaun Of The Dead which was cool but not for a third time seeing it. I got hiome about quarter to 12 which wasn't nice as my mum was angry but then I decided to grab my dinner go to my room, ring charli, eat the dinner, sit down, drink a glass of chocolate milkshake and wait for it aaaall to blow over!...

      Butterfly Effect. CHRIST! So yeah, yesterday was pretty screwed up I mentioned yesterday how about the whole arguemnt with Charli but now it's worse, we went out to try and sort it out but lets just say It didn't turn out well at all. Firstly we went to Starbucks, we stood there awkwardly not touching, hugging or anything so were sat upstairs each end of the table, I then realise just how much I might lose and i get tears in my eyes, so then I spend the next hour trying to get her to talk to me, which jsut ended up with me crying... and no thats not a GAY thing to do grrr. So eventually we ended up 'ok' we agree'd I was a bastard and decided to go to the cinema, on the way to the cinema, we talked and had alot of fun we ran around and laughed and it was great and then we kissed and I said "your a very special person, and who ever gets to be with you is so lucky" to which she replied "I guess you lucky then" I was so happy, so we spent a while messing around then eventually we got to the cinema and bought some tickets to... *Sigh* the Butterfly Effect. We got hungry and went to Burger King but before that we sat on the steps of Ster Century and talked which was totally cool, I know at this point your thinking - "So things turned out ok?" but they did'nt we got to Burger King... had some food, got all the way to the cinema, then things went bad, we sat there and I went to kiss her and she just stared blankly... so I left it, I asked her if she was upset with me still and she was, I didn't know what to do. I tried to make her feel more comftorble but nothing, I left to go to the toilet where I stared at myself in the mirror and realised how much I screwed up, went back and spent the rest of the film with tears rolling down my face and like EVERY fucking time I stopped something happened in the film that made me start again it was NOT the film to go and see... so fucking screwed up, the only part I laughed at was when he had no arms and he said something, I cant even remember. At the end of the film I just cried and couldn't stop and I told her that I didn't mean or want any of this to happen and that I loved her and she told me she loved me too... we hugged and then on the way down we decided to go on a break until I could get over this girl and I think I am, yesterday made me realise that I didn't want her if this was going to happen, yesterday upset me so god damn much... I would rather just be with Charli, but she wont believe that. Anyhow, Charli got upset when we were waiting to go home and I promised her things would be okay, we hugged but then when we got to my house not even a hug... I guess things need time... Today I'm getting my hair cut and meeting up with Betty for coffee's hopefully I will feel a bit better at the end of the day. See you around.

      Just keep screwing up, its all I EVER fucking do. Me and Charli had an arguement last night to which was my fault, I over reacted and she hung up, so I got pissed off eventually that got sorted at like 1 in the morning then she said "Is there anything else you want to tell me" and recently theres this girl I kind of have a tiny crush on so I wanted to be honest so I told her and basicly from there everythings gone to hell, 6 months of the happiest days of my fucking life just thrown away because I had to open my big stupid fucking mouth! This went on until like half 3 when I eventually turned my phone, off, phoned her this morning and things were better, we'd both calmed down and we agreed to meet up and talk but Im extremely fucking scared cause I just know something bads going to happen... you know, 6 months I've been with her and not one day have I ever regretted except today, I wish I could take all of it back and just not said a word cause now phone conversations are screwed up, when I think of her I have this sick feeling in my stomach and I just know things arn't going to be good today. Im sorry everything yet I cant take any of it back because no matter what I do or say she probably wont trust me, I cant say anymore, my minds a total blank anyhow I got to go cause my tutors here soon not that Im gonna take a word of what he says In, I wish I had someone to talk to, someone who could listen to me but Its stupid because these days no advice given can help things arn't that simple, you cant walk around and live a normal happy life because the next fucking corner you turn is going spring something new on you that will totally fuck up your life! Enough ranting time to get mathical. Bye

      Yeah, pretty much a boring day yesterday, heres how it went down mofo!... First of I get up and get ready for Mr. Phil, next thing I know its 3 and he was meant to be here at 1. I then think "Hey forget it, I'll make plans with Hans" so I begin to make plans with Hans only the parents refuse to let me out without having dinner or anything which was really lame, so that throws my whole Idea of meeting up with Hans out the window as she had to be home at 6. Step two: See what Nick's up to, sadly him and Xav had gone somewhere so I couldnt exactly tag along at the last minute, anyhow, so Im sitting there bored and all when Mr. Phil rings back, turns out he can come by about 6ish, I say its fine. Get ready and everything only for him to ring back at 5 and explain that he cant come at 6 because hes got to drive to Bristol so in the end we left it. Which brings me onto the plans of my marvelous weekend which isnt shaping up that badly at all, just very busy, today Im seeing the wonderful Charli at 1, but then I got to go at 6 to get home for Phil so thats going to be a tight squeeze me thinks. THEN on Sunday the lovely Hans has given up some of her time so we can go get coffee's. We have also planned to go to McDonalds and we have a plan envolving a care bear happy meal.... heh heh heh. It's wierd, I've known Hans for aout 3 months kind of, but thats only 'every now and then' talk on MSN, then I actually saw her for the first time on Tuesday but I couldnt recognise her as I had never had a photo of her or anything, so that night we made plans to go out on Thursday. So that was like the very first time I met her but it doesn't seem like it, I feel as though I have known her for a while, meh, some serious mindless babbling going in this blog. Woaho Def Leopard is on TV... some rather interesting guitar riffs there, speaking of guitar my self taught talent is progressing quite well, since Christmas I have learnt alot, most people would thing its pretty easy stuff but its somewhat of an accomplishment for me. I really want a Strat-o-caster, but I need money, I dont think I'm able to get one for £4.50, do you? Anyhow yeah, Im going to go climb back Into bed, goodmorning candy caners with beautiful brainers.

      I have NO! Idea! Im just sat here at like 9:13 Am wondering what to do. Started this baby up because my old site has expired now... need to re-new it but lack of funds is my problem. Yesterday! Yesterday was a fucking great day! Met up with Hans for like the first time ever, we met in town and she gave me a leaflet for this website and some how I ended up with her email, but yeah met up with her and shes so damn cool. Kept getting paranoid that I was looking at her wierdly but then I started getting paranoid cause I was just looking like I always do. But yeah we met up at like 1 went to Starbucks and had a hot chocolate which was cool and we talked about like Simpsons and stuff then we walked to... um... the steps outside Marks And Spencers and we sat there for a while and talked about the Simpsons, home lives, music, friends and stuff and then we went to the upstairs of M&S (Dont know If Im ligitimate enough to abbrieviate to that - considering I only go there to use their toilets) and they had this bath tub filled with see-thru balls so we tried to stack them up but it went down hilll.... Anyhow we then ventured to multiple joke and bits'n'bobs shops and she bought this pen that looked like crap... novelty items... you just cant refuse, I purchased some blue mouth sweets (Han's had one) to give to Nick when he got into town but he phoned me on mine and Hans' next point of venture - the Cardiff Market! Yeah I rated this not very highly at all, at this point her mouth was very blue... VERY blue and she kept licking her teeth to get it off but forgetting her tounge was blue. 2 Pet stores and a fish shop later we ended up in Toys 'R' Us where we tried on childrens masks and bought a childs Police mans kit, with handcuffs and everything. It then got very cold so we sat in the Pura Coffee Bar... which was cool cause we talked for a while again. Theeeeen we left cause she got restless and started fiddling with the Police Toy gun, so we went to Coffee#1 where I treated her to a hot chocolate with marshmellows... AND CREAM!... and some chocolate cake, of course she got like very thing about me paying for her but blegh... Im'a nice'a guy! At this point with the left over cake and some sugar packets we began constructing a snowman, which eventually turned into a russian artist, rolling around in snow, with a fat belly but REALLY thin arms (made out of wooden stirrers) and a scarf and hat made out of sugar packets... great stuff but then they were closing so we had to figure out a way of getting him out of there so we managed to get him onto a napkin but as I picked him up his head fell off... so we put him down and made a cross and RIP sign out of the sticks and then left. We ended up sat on the upstairs floor of Ster Century, nuts I tell thee, it was cool, the security guard kept giving us the EYE though... so we kept talking and it got to like 8:30 and this really pissed off guy came over and said "What are you doing here?!" to which I replied "Just sitting here" and he said "Dont be sarcastic mate! What are you doing here?!"... there was not one ounce of sarcasm in my answer... eventually he told us to get out so we got the bus home, great stuff. Quite a fun day, might be seeing Hans later but I got to go out with Mr. Phil today, but yeah busy days a head, this is one big fuck-off post, anyhow I should go before I get way ahead of myself and write more, arg Im still going! So long my children.

      Okay, I know you probably don't want to hear me rant about this but I have too. Not so much of a rant but meh, I think personally that this years Big Brother... isn't going to be that bad! Yeah I know, I thought It was going to suck but when you look at the characters in there you notice that there is going to be alot of stuff happening. The only thing I found very set-up about it is the personalities, each person seems to have a 'type' of personality as if their picked to have confrontations and the such. I'll explain what I mean, heres a breif description of each characters personality. Ahmed: An ex-asylum seeker who hates America and likes to think he doesn't get along with most people. He despises homosexuals. Quite quiet. Quite racist. Dan: Gay but not camp. Quite straight forward, you can tell he's gay by some of the things he says but hes not camp. He hates 'camp' gay people. Emma: The quirky, dumb-looking girl from Manchester reminds me of Big Brothers Jade from the previous, no real hates I don't believe. Jason: Entered the house in a thong, and spent alot of the time showing off but claims he doesn't 'love' himself, once agains seems to get along with everyone. Kitten: Oooo! Nasty! A political activist who hates homophobia and racism. Is gay and quite proud, stands up for herself. Made an interesting 'set-up'-ish  house entrance. Marco: The campest man alive?! Everytime someone ran into the house he jumped and screamed like a girl and shouted 'Oh MY GOD!' alot. Hates domestic estates. Michelle: The 'sexy'(?) but not stupid girl. Says that she just likes to looks 'sexy' and loves 'sex' and 'porn'. Thats great Michelle! Nadia: Not much needs to be said here apart from she used to be a man. But the housemates don't know. Shell: That sort of, girl-next-door-esque persona. Seems pretty cool actually, quite smart and has good conversations. Threatened to give a strip-tease. Stuart: HE GOT FOR A's IN HIS EXAMS! Yeah he tells that to people alot. Seems quite big-headed but he can back it up. He has had some good conversations. Vanessa: Um, not much can be said about her. She seems pretty down to earth, a good-looking gal' who likes heavy metal. Nothing wrong with it. Victor: From DA' hood bruv. Says he had a rough up-bringing but seems quite adventurous, wants to learn more about people but is quite 'Ghetto' if you will. I think It will be quite interesting to watch this one, Nadia will be funny to watch, heh. Only Marco has caught on about her being a man or... ex-man but is telling the others. Alot of confrontations seem to be set up though, Ahmed and Kitten, Marco, Dan with the whole, gay/racist thing. Dan and Marco cause Dan hates camp gay people, Shell and Marco because Marco hates domestic living, I think its Shell who lives like that but I'm not sure. I think I'm going to get really pissed off with Marco and Victor... not sure why but their too 'blah'. But yeah I think it will be interesting. Ah well. They also seem to be encouraging sexual activity, like they got 12 housemates but only 10 beds, two are double beds. And the shower is see-through with a camera in their. They have some sort of 'love-nest' if you will outside. It's really odd. Meh. Im off, I'll update later.

      I AM STILL BEING FORCED! Aparently my last one wasn't updatey enough, okay so anyhow, lately I havn't been up to much, had my English Lit. GCSE today which I got REALLY frustrated in because I found it so hard to sit there for 2 and a half hours without movign around. I think I did well, I'm not sure, I hope so anyway. Tonight I just watched the last episode of Friends which was quite sad and also this Big Brother 5 thing, which just seems to scream confrontations heres the line-up so far, Marco, a really queen-y, gay, (I think), happy, hyper guy, Ackhmed, a guy who hates gays and seems quite bitter because hes been an ex-asylum seeker, Jay (I think that was it) a guy who is obviously going to show it all off since he turned up in a thong, he thinks hes pretty good looking but claims he doesn't love himself and finally Dan, a gay guy who hates gay's who are queen-y. Loads of confrontational people there. Anyhow, not much planned lately, Im just chilling out. Betty, your alright!

      Oh dear god!... This is the most childish/interesting/full of crappy ideas morning I have EVER had! I woke up like really early, so I decided to watch Pokemon as it was on Sky One and I couldn't find my remote. I dont mean to be rude but is it me or do the creators of Pokemon just repeat the same things over and over again, a 3 year old could plan a series of Pokemon. Example;  Episode 01:  Ash Ketchup finds a pokemon called Crap-o-mon! Whilst Team [Insert Evil Name Here] plot to steal Ash's favorioute pokemon - uhh... Gay-ma-chu! but fail to exectue the plot eventually flying into the sky using some Japanese style animation whilst shouting a phrase that relates to their team name in different vocal pitches.  Episode 02:  Ketchup ends up at a Pokemon center after crap-o-mon gets a bad case of the runs, he runs into a nurse that his friend, Dave, finds very attractive and pauses every now and then whilst the background still moves. Meanwhile Team [Insert Evil Name Here] suprise Ash with a battle, Gay-ma-chu uses his trust flower punch! Team [Insert Evil Name Here] exit using the same way they did in episode 01. Crap-o-mon runs back to Ketchup and they share a moment of breif emotion.  Episode 03:  Dave gets arrested for harrasing the nurse by the police woman who looks alot like the nurse, Dave finds her attractive... again. Ash finds the gym-leader, Kin-Jo-Fu-Ya-Crazy-Japanese-Name-Wing! Master of... uh... business Pokemon, Ketchup loses a battle cause Crap-o-mon is crap, hence the name, why did he catch that one? Ash learns a valuable lesson about how not to find his pokemon attractive!  Episode 04:  WOOOO! Ash wins the battle because Crap-o-mon evolved into... Shit-e-mook and used his... uh... flying fece's attack after Kin-Jo-Fu-Ya-Crazy-Japanese-Name-Wing's pokemon - Corperateish missed with his close breifcase attack. Ash gets his first gym badge - Business-esque name badge. Dave is released from prison and group travel to their next location - Torquay.  See, easy! took me, like 5 minutes. Anyhow, so after Pokemon finished I went on the computer and sat their wondering what to do, played some Weird Al whilst I sat their and contemplated what to do, when I noticed a Harry Potter advert on TV so I randomly decided to download the game... meh... its still going, I have a HORRIBLE feeling its going to be a virus. Then anyhow, I turn around and whats on TV - YU GI OOOOOOOOOOOOOooh maaan!... Switch OVER! Meh... Im hungry, I'll post a bit later.

      I just cant help but like this Fountains Of Wayne song - Stacy's Mom, (and no, not for the video) but the song is really catchy, mainly the chorus. Speaking of music Avril Lavigne's back, how queer... I think her song is about like losing her virginity or something thats what It sounds like to me... hmmm. Bloody Lavigne! I should be revising now cause my mum is angry at me cause I invited Xav and Nick around at 2... so like I'm missing an hour and a half of regular school time (SHOCK SHOCK HORROR HORROR) meh, I said I would make it up tomorrow, do and extra hour and a half. Im bored, but this song is keeping me happy. Ummm... My tutor's coming soon, hes going to go through some physics with me *sigh*, I know that at some point today my mum is going to town so I can be lazy and play computer games *smiles*. Staaaacy cant you see your just not the girl for me. Heh, cathcy like RIGHT THERE! Speaking of which, I was watching (by the way this has nothing to do with that catchy line so its not "speaking of which" really) but anyhow yes, I was watching the new Velvet Revolver video on Kerrang! last night, it was quite cool but I noticed Slash (at least I'm assuming its Slash considering he looks exactly the same as he always does) and then after that this retro-old Guns'N'Roses video came on and I swear to god it was EXACTLY the same slash apart from a different logo on the shirt. He had the same hair, same guitar, same leather pants, same glasses, same facial expressions, same movement... it was odd, and for some reason Axl Rose had no pants on, just these tight red lycra shorts... *shudders*. Im outie before my mother catches me.

      Nothing happens by accident. Nothing happens at random. Random is planned. For every action there is a reaction. Chaos can be at the end of any of those actions as a reaction. I saw the Butterfly Effect, and they quote at the start of the film the Chaos Theory, I got REALLY interested in it and looked more into it and the more I read the more it made sense and the more life makes sense when you apply this possibility to every aspect of it. Example, your pet is about to die, something in your and that pets life happened to cause that pet to die, either it ate something, it got hit by something or attracted an illness. Nothing happens by accident or at random that pet can't just wake up one day just dead or about to die because of no aparent reason. Anyhow point to that is that my life at the moment seems to relate to that alot, I failed IT, I can't say when someone asks me why I failed that I don't know because thats not true, I must of done something to cause this and the reason for that is that I didn't do the work. There are other things happenening and aswell that personally I would rather not dsicuss in public but their pretty big. I've lived a good time lately, I finished school monday which was cool but sad in the same way because I'm going to miss alot of it, especially Xav who's going to atlantic college, hes a good man! But yeah, yesterday I went to the park with Betty, which was amazing, we talked and stuff and yeah it was just really cool. Shes great. Muse are cool, I can play part of Hyper Music *smiles* meh, ah well, bye.

      Aha! Today, some bitching and random comments! GOOOOO! Okay, first - guitar! Is going extremely well, like I've only been playing since *thinks* probably like... end of January... properly you know. And I know a bunch of songs (easy stuff, some just rythem) but its perfect for me cause I only want to be a rythem guitarist so Im happy with how Im doing at the moment. I even have my first gig-type thing, Im working with my friends band (he asked me to do rythem) for the school's rock show type thing, I'm going to be playing Buck Rogers by Feeder and possibly All My Life by the Foo Fighters. Xav on drums (which is wierd cause he's an amazing guitarist), Nick on lead guitar, Lee on bass and me on rythem. So yeah I'm pretty proud of how far I have come in the past months with my guitar, Nick said he's even thinking about asking me to become a full member. Things in my life are doing alright, kind of full lately, plans-wise, me and Charli are doing okay, had a few problems as of late, its not full sorted-out but I guess we need to take it a step at a time. Had like the biggest mis-haps the other day, I was texting that girl because she was upset I hadnt text her in ages and I put "you know I loves you really" and in one of them movie-type moments - I sent it to Charli. It was okay in the end, Charli did'nt take it the wrong way - thank god. Okay anyhow yeah so were doing okay, not bad I guess. Music: Lately I have been once again on my nonstop-Nirvana phase, Im absoloutly amazed at Bleach. I've had it for a while like - a long time but latelty I'm listening to it every chance I get. I had some emo kid walk up to me in the middle of town the other day, you the typical kind - long (unwashed looking) blonde-Cobain-esque hair, a t-shirt with "Kurt D. Cobain - 1962 to 1994" on it, huge baggy jeans with rips all over, pale skin and a generally - "I'm so depressed, its fucking rediculous, my parents hate me, I have no friends, I wish I could die but in reality I dont im just doing this for attention yet Im extremely out-spoken so its pretty obvious Im not depressed" looking face. Had ago at me for wearing a GLC t-shirt, started claiming it wasn't "music", I asked him what was and he named Blink, Nirvana and the such. He started claiming how GLC were a disgrace to music, one thing I pointed out to the mook was that GLC IS music, its just a different form that doesnt go on about heartache so he can cry his fucking eyes out to it. Two he wouldnt have a clue what music was even if it hit him in the face, there are alot more forms of music that pop-punk and grunge and such. GLC - becoming quite popular, I remember the first time I heard about them - my brother told me about them after he went to their first gig and I went on their site and downloaded some music of theirs and I found it absoloutly hilarious, a townie talked to me about them the other day asking me if I had heard Half-Man Half-Machine and when I said "yeah like... half a year ago" he would'nt believe me - odd fellow, Half-Man Half-Machine  isn't their best either I personally LOVE I Want My GLC. Anyhow today I have a VERY busy day I got to do my tutor session soon, so that should be cool which just reminded me I got to go and do a past paper. I got to go out with Charli then and then back to my house for half-six to go out with Phil - my god... what-a-day! So long my Children... oh wait, Van Helsing its pretty good, very cool and has some great story in and Egor is the bloody man! Bye kids!

      Heres something you dont hear very often,   "X is for XRAY'S YOU'VE HAD: a few. like when i swallowed my milk money when i was 6 (Seriously)"   - An extract from Cool Kates Journal alaphabet quiz.  Yeah its one of those things you'd love to happen yet they never do, infact a couple of those HAVE happened to me recently, like a girl ringing the bell on her bike to make me move out the way whilst walking down the path of a park on a sunny afternoon and lying in the middle of white petals in the middle of a park surrounded by tree's with a beautiful girl. Yep, registered www.blacksushi.co.uk yesterday, not up yet but will be.  ... to eat an orange!

      [ Current Music:  Limp Bizkit - Behind Blue Eyes] [ Current Mood:  Tired]  Okay, so today I got my year book and I was just scanning through it and It brought up alot of memories that I will miss so Im going to put all of my best ones here for all of you to see, in no particular order,   Unforgetable Memory Number 1:  In year 8... when I spent all lunch times in the Art rooms talking to this year 11 girl called Rosie, she was cool.  Unforgetable Memory Number 2:  Dying my hair blue, not only did I get suspended for that but it gave me a perfect reason to shout at Mrs. Worthington.  Unforgetable Memory Number 3:  Meeting Xav cause if It wasnt for him, I wouldnt be the person I am today and wouldn't have the friends I have today. Thanks alot man.  Unforgetable Memory Number 4:  Stealing Alex's bag and getting punched in the ribs several times for it!  Unforgetable Memory Number 5:  Hiding in Mr. Kemps reg several times before he drew the line and just constantly threw me out straight away.  Unforgetable Memory Number 6:  Meeting Charli, it was hard because it caused alot of problems with my friends like hanging around with her when they didnt know her but it was well worth it.  Unforgetable Memory Number 7:  Stealing Alex's bag and getting my head slammed into the wall for not giving it back.  Unforgetable Memory Number 8:  One of my best memories is choking Dean Gauci after he threw a rock at me.  Unforgetable Memory Number 9:  Walking out of Welsh after refusing to learn any more because I didn't enjoy it.  Unforgetable Memory Number 10:  Stealing Alex's bag and getting kicked in the neck pretty damn hard for it.  Unforgetable Memory Number 11:  Winning best dressed at the prom... heh oh wait... I didn't.  Yeah so there are more but those are the ones I'll never forget, I think i'm going to miss Corpus alot, cause after 5 years there its made a big impact on my life, mainly the people I met. So long Corpus.

      [ Current Music:  Inme - Faster The Chase] [ Current Mood:  Full]  Arrrg! I just ate a tub of Ben and Jerry's.... I feel full! Shall I tell you what are cool though? Microwave Dinners, there not that bad! Okay anyhow pretty sweet few kick ass days, last Wedensday I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers! It fucking ruled! I was sat down but I managed to stay with Holdstock(?!) throughout the whole thing so it was cool, James Brown was awsome, really, for a man of his age he has alot of stage spirit, doing all these jumps and stuff. He sang Sex Machine which was cool and he kept shouting "IM GONNA COUNT IT OFF!" and then his 'chicks' would shout "We cant start until you count it off" and then he for another 5 minutes would shout "IM GONNA COUNT IT OFF!" then... finally he did count it off and yes... the 'chicks' did start. Heh on the way home we saw an ambulance drive through town and I said to Holey - "Awww man... there goes James Brown" heh oh that crazy guy. Chicks On Speed were on before James Brown and too be honest the less said about them the better. The Chili's! NOW THEY WERE AWESOME! Never been so impressed with a band in my life, they played Cant Stop, Around the World, Californication, Get On Top, Scar Tissue, Throw Away Your Television, Fortune Faded, Otherside and loads more and each one was kick ASS, my fave was Around the World cause there was so much energy in it. Yeah then on Thursday Xav and Nick came over and we wobbled down to A Shot In The Dark for some Coffee, and Nick had their strongest coffee which is suprisingly called 'A Shot In The Dark', wasn't that strong really. Nick and Xav had some Lasagne aswell, which I paid for! But yeah it was all cool, then they both somehow ended up at my house to stay over which meant Xav spent all night making up stuff about monkeys and bikes and Nick lifted weights, I fell asleep *smiles* heh heh heh. Then the next day Xavs mum rang to say we had a meeting with our head teacher about the C-Fest thing which was pretty cool but we had like 3 hours in between so we made a third in the series of Homestar Runner movies: Dangeresque 3! which you can download there but beware its like 18 meg - click  urlLink HERE  for it. So then after we made that we walked down to the school whilst playing multiplayer Bop-It, the meeting went well, it was like to discuss the sound system and the interlude and stuff which is now all sorted. Then I got home and went out more or less straight away to see Charli which was great cause I was missing her alot so that was really cool we went to see Jersey Girl which wasnt that bad, Jenniffer Lopez died within the first 15 minutes so I was happy. Then I went home, woke up the next day and didn't feel to good so I had to go back to sleep for a while then Charli gave me a ring and asked to go out but I was too ill. I went back to bed when XAV calls and asks to go out, I still felt ill so I said no, then I couldn't get back to bed so I rang Charli and said if she gave me two hours I would see how I felt but we just decided to see eachother another day. Then I gave Xav a ring and explained the same thing and then eventually met him in Pizza hut where we drank loads of Pepsi and then I saw the new guitar he's getting which is gorgeous, it really is. Later we walked back to Xav's and stayed there a while, we all watched Dangeresque 3 (Me, Max, Xav, Roar and Nick) and then all excpet Max headed up to Alex' house for his party which was full of townies but it had a trampomoline! A TRAMPOMOLINE! That was pretty cool it was fun like a full size one, gymnastic stylee! A few drinks and a guy name Dan later me and Xav stumbled home to sleep, I fell asleep listening to Evanescence at his house to wake up in the morning and find out HE had been listening to them, but wasnt imensly impressed. Meh. I then had some toast and went to Nicks, heh heh heh where I played on a scooter and played some-not-so-good-piano-pieces-that-I-made-up. Eventually I got home but Was'nt allowed out to see Charli so I settled for calling Ross over and watching Muse at Glastonbury with some Ice-Cream. Woke up this morning. Now I have to go to a hospital appointment and lie when promising to wear some other crazy new invention for my legs. Ooo and tonight I get to see Charli which im pretty freaking happy about cause im really missing her, stoopid restrictive rules and days... hmmm... Im getting new shoes soon! NEW SHOES! Meh, Im tired, so long children that play on the road and sometimes with chickens....

      [ Current Music:  Marilyn Manson - Fight Song] [ Current Mood:  Ugly]  Turns out Nick IS addicted to coffee and yes David Healen is still angry. Man I've been so tired lately, never in my life been so tired. Only two exams left! Wahey! Man thats cool, I was kind of expecting them to go on for  alot longer but they havn't. Thats odd. Meh so anyway Barney is on TV, I've always wondered what would happen if Barney lashed out at that green dinosaur - Baby Bop. Like on todays episode she was eating all of the apples without asking now personally I'd scream at her "What the FUCK Bop?! You can just take a brothers apples!" Elmo was on before Barney, Elmo, now theres a kid with alot of bottled up emotions. Anyway my Welsh exam went better than I thought, like my teacher - Miss. Partridge spent two years  trying  to explain to me - just look for similar words. Thank god I partially pay attention in lessons ey? After the exam me, Xav, Nick, Mahaze and Ben went down to the part to where we played on the swings and this rocking horse/dog. Nick and Xav did a tandum swing which was cool, Nick sat on the swing and then Xav sat on his shoulders which was really cool. Then Mahaze tried to get on top of the frame so as he went up we stole his shoes and threw them at him. Then Xav ran off with one... hehe climbed to the other side of the river, whilst Mahaze was looking for Xav I took his bad and joined Xav then we found a tire, can't remember what happened to that. Oh and Ben tried to throw Mahazes bag to me over the river and it landed in it, that was funny. RE exam, woaho no! Yeah screwed up on it, partially cause of little or no revision and partly due to the controversial questions. One of them was "Are Men and Women equal?" and although I quickly placed my views on how they are I then launched into a full attack on the Catholic church having ago at them for being sexist which is totally true so turns out God is Gay. Yesterday I spent the day with Charli which was great cause I havn't done that in ages, we tried to find our way to the Bay but couldn't find a way... maybe next time. We then went to Ster and saw Mean Girls and may I say Lindsay Lohan IS the sex. Shes so hot, I mean she was hot in Freaky Friday but there was a whole new level of hot in Mean Girls, anyway after that me and Charli hanged out in the park and started wrestling, hehe I beat her twice and she only beat me once! Then we had to go home so blah that sucked, hopefully my wish'll come true and I'll see her again VERY soon. Today Mr. Greenhow is coming by for the LAST time, definetly this time, and he's going to go over a bit of Physics for me, then no more getting up early on Sundays, and you can quote me on that! CHILI'S ON WEDENSDAY! My brother went to their Hyde Park show yesterday, got home VERY late or should I say early? but still managed to get up for work so good on him, hopefully he'll give me all the details, Anyhow I'm off, later children on the sex.

More on this NEXT TIME!  Next Time On 'This Diary Thing', WILL Rhys ever reveal his true feelings for Megan? Is Nick REALLY addicted to coffee? Will David Healen be less ANGRY?

      [ Current Music:  Keane - Everbodys Changing] [ Current Mood:  Proud]  Whoaho! Nicks here again, not Xav or Ben this time though. Nicks trying to learn 'Girl You Have No Faith In Medicine', anyhow the band thing is sorted now, were playing Buck Rogers by Feeder, Hardest Button To Button by White Stripes, and Can't Stop by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I'll be doing chords in Buck Rogers for the verse and chrous, playing all of Hardest Button To Button except for a solo Nicks doing and I'll be playing the solo in Can't Stop which is quite cool. Okay now had my Maths exam today, went rather well got stuck on two questions only, thing I got the first one in the end though but gave up on the other. Only 4 more exams left, 2 RE, 1 Physics and 1 Welsh, all ends next Tuesday and THEN the day after -  RED HOT FUCKING CHILI PEPPERS! , its come around so quick I really can't wait. I'm getting quite the angry fellow in the mornings cause I wake up feeling like crap so I need to sort that out some how, but not long now and I can spend the whole morning in bed *smiles* I love the summer. Okay anyhow, should be going up Nicks later so I'll update tomorrow or a bit later or something, bye kids.

      [ Current Music:  Richard Cheese - Shake Ya Ass] [ Current Mood:  Pissed Off]  Yeah so couldn't really feel anymore unwanted at the moment, I kind of feel the band I'm in don't need me at all because someone seem content on cutting my peices out, my chord sequence on the verse of Buck Rogers cause its "too heavy" and were not doing the song they do need me for, and the rest Nick can play on his own so why do they need me? I've left it up to Lee and Nick to decide cause It seems pretty pointless for me to say anything. I can't really be bothered I mean it was a good idea to start the band, we were doing well, really getting our act together but it seems as though all my parts are being cut out so its up to them now really.

      [ Current Music:  Incubus - Megalomaniac] [ Current Mood:  Tired]  Sneddon? On TV?! In this day and age?! Oh my... GOD... Sneddon. So anyhow this morning I flooded my shower room, hehe. T'was really cool, there I am just a scrubbing away and I say "Hmm... wonder if the water should really be flooding around the door" anyhow, without any worry I finished my shower then decided to sort it out, wasted a shower mat, two towels and my clothes in drying it all up. Heh. Anyhow in other news, got my very last maths tutor session today! *dances* I can't believe I can now sleep in on sunday mornings! *dances again* no but in all fairness it has been worth it, I feel alot more confident in maths, example, in my non-calculator I got really pissed off and stopped working cause I convinced myself I had screwed up and then I was like "Wait I can do this!" and I did, I think I did okay. Anyhow yes lots of exams lately, had Welsh on friday, 15 bloody minutes. 15. I get up at 7:30am to sit in school for 15 minutes. Well thats fan-bloody-tastic! Oooo! On my way home from that me and Nick were taking a "short-cut" through the woods (which was open to the path we were waling up) and I said "Oh look a bank, its linked to the main road I think" so I started climbing the bank as Nick crossed the river and this guy pulls up in his car (bare in mind me and Nick never crossed any full fences or signs) and he said "What are you doing?" and I carried on climbing thinking he thought I needed help and he gets out and says "This is private property" so I say "Oh sorry I didn't know, I'll go" so he starts shouting at me and swearing at me threatening to kick the crap out of me and as I'm leaving whilst apologising and explaining I didn't know it was private he bloody kicks me in the ribs. I mean there was no need, I apologised and was leaving the area so there was absoloutly no need to kick me, he said "Does it look like its not private property", may I ask what does private property look like? Anyhow got two exams tomorrow, Chemistry and English (Wahay last English exam... I think), I'm really tired but on the other hand I have a new Lindsay Lohen (Mean Girls) poster *smiles*, I thank Charli for that! What other things do I have to say? Not much. Ooo Chili Peppers are soon! Looking forward to that alot. Um Luke Smith (Smitty) IS the sex. Done.

      Hey kids! Tuned in again I see, yeah Im sorry for not updating for so long been uber busy, revision and exams and the such. But hey I'm back for your not-so-weekly dose of my random ramblings. I have this MASSIVE fuck-off tooth ache, it really hurts like everytime I take a drink or bite down on it actually no, when I bite down it its okay its when I'm not biting down on it that it hurts. Which is stupid. It hurts alot and is preventing me from hoarding sloaths in  my printer so It needs to be gotten rid of but I cant because I have that thing - dentist-a-phobia, which basicly means I'm afraid of getting eaten by weather-balloons but I also got that thing where Im scared of going to the dentist cause they insist on shoving needles down my trachea. Anyhow, first the boring stuff, I had a couple of exams lately, monday I had Biology! Which I must say I didn't do that bad on apart from the question about the dog with the genetic hair and such, t'was quite the confundlement. Today I had IT today which resulted in much frustration I mean personally I think I ace'd the exam but It was a 2 hour exam and It took the whole class less than an hour yet they wouldn't let me leave the god damn hall. Felt like slapping them. Really hard! Also had maths today which I was very disappointed with cause I was convinced I was going to do well cause of all my tutor sessions and I just got really stressed during the exam. I think I might of atleast earned myself a 'C' grade. Thats good enough... I suppose. Fun things, last night, I went to Incubus with Hundred Reasons supporting which TOTALLY kicked ass and I mean totally, me and Charli got right to thr front (on the left) and Brandon Boyd was like right infront of us at one point and it was so cool. He was absoloutly amazing when singing and the instrumental side of things were kick-ass. Hundred Reasons were better in my opinion but I like them more than Incubus anyway. Best thing of the whole night was that Incubus did a cover of Black Hole Sun (Originally by Soundgarden) which was fucking awsome! I got band practice (kind of) on Friday which should be cool and then after that Im getting paid to sit there and watch TV whilst keeping a dog company so it doesn't bark when my aunts out. Ain't that cool?. I got Big Fish on DVD which kicks ass, cant wait to watch it, havn't had time at the moment *shakes head*. Anyhoos, my tooths hurting, and I think some people are pretty upset/angry with me, so I'm going to bed, so long my children of the night.

      [ Current Music:  RHCP - Give It Away] [ Current Mood:  Mixed Up]  Nicks back! Yeah Nicks back which is cool, things all seem right until today... first of all the past couple of days. Things have been awsome, Nick comes back Monday night which was cool so then on Tuesday morning im online and he comes online and tells me of this girl he met called Jen, and then he came over mine and we made toasties and talked about Kenya and then Xav came over, then we went to town where I bought a new CD player that has this really cool attachment thats a tape with a wire that plugs into your CD played and you can play CD's in cassette cars. I also bought John Frusciante's album - Shadows Collide With People which is absoloutly awsome, I love it and I got some comics too. Then we went back to Xavs for a little while and listened to Nicks new Chili's albums and then Xav went for an interview so me and Nick went back to his where his mum gave us a roast dinner and lemon and lime jelly. Then we realised that we were meant to be back at mine for when Xav turns up. So I run up stairs to get my stuff and my MUM calls, I pick up;  Mum:  Rhys, do you know Xavs here?  Me:  Um... yeah about that, hes staying  Mum:  Oh right, where are you then?  Me:  At Nicks... he's staying too  Mum:  Okay...  Me:  I'll be home soon! So long! Done and done I tell thee so back at mine we ass around, try and play monopoly then blah blah blah. Okay next day me and Nick go to his house then go to Xavs then go see spiderman 2 and then um *thinks* oh then I go to Nicks and sleep over his where I play Holdstock at online Connect 4... he won. Me and nick drew some pictures and then I went home the next morning after our who can Make/Butter/Eat your toast and clean your plate first race. It was a draw.

      [ Current Music:  Adema - Giving In]  [ Current Mood:  Musical]   Yesterday was my first taster session for St. Davids, yeah its nothing special, I got so bored that I left at lunch and went to xavs and then went home. I mean yeah i'm gonna go there but blah its not all that interesting there are 1 or two things about it, for example, the amount of nice people there and the fact theirs no uniform, you dont have to do subjects you dont want to and you go out during free periods. Thats all cool but generally its not the spiffiest place I've ever been too, its quite run down to be honest but It'll do me.  Anyhow yes planning to re-decorate my roomiau so it will have more space which should be uberly cool cause I love my room but theres not nearly enough free-space in here, and I know most people would think "well why have free space if your not going to do anything in it?" and thats true but I feel kind of closed in and its too dark aswell so Im painting my walls LIME green and my cieling blue and getting a single bed instead and just moving a few things around, packing things away so theres less clutter, so hopefully it will be all the better. Guitars going well, I have to say that apart from the obvious webdesign its the one talent that I'm proud of cause alright I'm not the greatest amateur guitarist in the world but I'm working my ass off with it, I practice every day for atleast an hour or more. But meh.  Yeah me, Scott and Ben decided that Coffee #1 will be our hang out for college cause its all nice like that! I think i've decided what I want to do and thats Media and Film studies, Psychology and Politics so hopefully that should be fun. Theres alot of nice people in the college, I met a guy called Matt who was quite cool - like me he just wanted to go to sleep so thats all good. And a girl called Sophie who was pretty sweet, she likes the same music as me so we talked about that for a little while. Ben was cool (Gentle Ben) yeah, hav'nt seen the guy in ages so it was great to see him again.  Socialising at the moment has been a bit of a problem due to the fact that I'm too tired to do anything, Holeys party-esque thing is on saturday and one: I dont have any money, two: If i'm honest as much as I would like to see the guys I'm WAY too tired to go. Im not kidding, last night I went over Charli's new house, so I got home from college, and had like an hour or something before I had to go so I flicked on the TV and Ice Age was on and I fell straight asleep, her phone call woke me up 45 minutes later when she asked "Is alright If we come now?" It's been like it alot lately, I fell asleep on the bus the other day and had missed my stop but luckily the stop I got off at wasnt far from the one I needed. I dont know why I'm so tired and thats what bugs me the most, I dont stay out or up late and Im always full of energy but Im just really tired lately.  So yeah Roar didnt come over in the end which sucks cause I was looking forward to seeing the guy, playing gamecube and the such. I MISS NICK! Sorry but I do, really everyone does, things really arnt the same when Nicks not around to either laugh, make jokes, get angry, seem drunk or screw things up. Its not long before he's back, I got Disney soon which will be UBERLY cool. Got to get ready for that though, anyhow despite the fact my dogs in a phase of pulling my bed sheets apart im going to sleep again, i should be in college right now but Im too tired...

Then shes sat there eating something whilst I'm searching through all these boxes for pairs of scissors but all I can find is style things and such. Anyhow eventually she chases after me and I grab this MASSIVE how to cut hair book and beat her up with it. And then the whole dream turns into this computer game that looked a bit like the zoomed out version of habbo hotel and all these policeman were running around and there was me and the woman but I wasnt sure what character I was and then I realised I was me and the beat her but then all the police handcuffed me and then next thing I knew I was in this courtroom that was just a glass box where I looked around and on the side of the hairdresser were all her family but they were all Africans... and on my side nobody was there it was all empty benches. Then the case begins but I'm in my pyjamas so anyhow JASON from big brother is the first to say something and he says something like "If he even had a fight with his hampster how can he withstand all the breaks in his legs" and I start shouting about my operations and casts to him and then the judge stands up and its the QUEEN! I know the Queen... its so odd. Anyhow then  I shut up and look at the back where all these Indian people are sat laughing then look up out of the window and theres these mean in blue shirts and stuff and they start smiling and then one of them who looks like this guy off this film I saw once (not sure of his name or what film) he starts like making crude gestures at the Queen and then the image goes back to the court room and everyones screaming and cheering for them for standing up to the Queen and then suddenly it goes back to the men who now have bullet proof pads on and have guns and they get into this blue car and then drive off and straight after that all these black hummers drive in and loads of Japanese guys (who look like the guys in Kill Bill 1 where she must kill like all 100 of them before getting to the boss), they all jump out of these hummers in slow motion weilding there guns, back in the coutroom the Queen says "This is clearly unsafe, everyone go to London" then every goes through this back door where all my friends are like Lee, Nick, Xav and Ben and the Queens there and women dressed in football style shorts and shirts but the back room of the courtroom is like a football locker room so anyway I try to jump through the glass (which has the Queen standing by it) but it doesn't smash... CAUSE ITS ON HINGES and it just opens like a door and then all these Japanese men do the slow motion running over these really green hills and then I woke up...  I swear I'm not lying that was my dream it was so odd...

      [ Current Music:  Muse - Cant Take My Eyes Off You] [ Current Mood:  Hyper]  Hey people. How are you? Im great, had an alright holiday, it was wonderful weather but slightly boring here and there never mind ey. Got back and spent a couple of days with the guys and Charli who I missed terribly. Attened 2 thirds of the Big Weekend, where I saw some pretty cool bands, The Delays, Fun Lovin' Criminals, Bad Manners and Chas 'N' Dave. Alright so Chas 'N' Dave wer'nt the best but they were pretty funky. During Bad Manners we (meaning Me, Xav, Lee, Matt and Nick) all went to the front which was insane and we starting skanking which was awsome. Then During Chas 'N' Dave I ran into my brother and his friends and started dancing with them all which was really cool. After that me, Nick, Lee and Xav all went to my house and chilled out, played guitar and the such. The next morning whilst the guys slept and I went into town with my Dad to pick up a new spangly guitar, its silver, great pickups, clamps which equal wammy madness. Its a really gorgeous guitar. The guy who tried it out in the shop was insane when playing, anyhow got back and had a blast on it then we all went back to town for day 2 of the big weekend this time with Ben and others, alot of people pissed me off cause they were like "Oh, Bens coming..." and personally I like the guy, hes a nice person at heart and like EVERYONE in the world can get on peoples nerves, even I do and I know it. But yeah seeing Ben was cool, saw Charli too, then we all went to the stage area where I talked to my brother for a bit then despite somebodys whinning (were not sure who it was) we saw the Delays who in my opinion were absoloutly awsome. Their DJ has a great hat on and I kept screaming that I wanted it, never got it though never mind ey. I was talking to their guitarist whilst he was on stage which was absoloutly awsome cause he could understand me and first of all I asked him to get the DJ's hat, never happened, then I was telling him he was doing an awsome job. After that the Fun Lovin' Criminals were on, they were cool, some slow songs which did not appeal to me they played some harder ones that really got the crowed pumping and it waent crazy me, Xav, Nick and Charli really got into it. Meanwhile me and Nick noticed that certain people were just really not getting into it even though they obviously liked the music, but they had no spirit or enthusiasm. After that with much confusion involving a missing Lee, Charli's parents massive car, one of us getting out to meet Lee, a bus ride home and a helium filled balloon, we got home safely but not the way it should of ended up. Nick, Xav and Lee were meant to stay at mine but instead Lee and Xav ended up and Xav's house and Nick at mine. Woke up this morning, gave my guitar a go which was nice, slept a little more. Gave Charli a ring, and then discussed my rooms new decoration which is going ahead tomorrow. Done and Done, see you all soon.
