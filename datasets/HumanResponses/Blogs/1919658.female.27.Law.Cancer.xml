       The End is Nigh   Dear Atlanta,  I’m leaving you.  That’s one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to write.  But I felt that I owed you an explanation, some sort of reason why this is ending.  I love you, more than I’ve loved anything.  For the last eight years, you have been home to me.  You helped me build a life, independent of my family.  You helped me shed my childhood; you’ve gently coaxed me into womanhood.  You filled my life with activities, friends, and great loves.  And while I was with you, I never once wondered what else there could be for me outside of your arms.  You entertained me, challenged me, and educated me.  And for this I will always be grateful.  But you and I both know that things have been different for a while.  After I graduated, I felt lost.  And you didn’t understand.  I didn’t have a job, I was running out of money, and I needed you.  I needed your help and support.  But you ignored me.  You just continued to act like everything was normal, when we both know that it wasn’t.  And while you were out having fun, I met someone else.  I met Washington, D.C.  And for a moment I believed D.C. was what I needed.  D.C. is actually not too much different from you, Atlanta.  But D.C. was older.  And with that age came the maturity and refinement that I believed that I wanted.  I saw D.C. a couple of times and I actually thought that I could be happy in D.C.’s arms, that I could be content.    But that’s not who I’m leaving you for.  I actually fell for one of your neighbors.  I fell for Albany.  Can you believe it?  I fell for what you would consider a “country bumpkin”!  And I will admit, Albany isn’t you.  Albany isn’t refined and is surprisingly young; not too much younger than you, but not the type that I would normally fall for.  I know you will never understand what the attraction is between Albany and myself.  I don’t expect anyone will.  Albany is utterly lacking in sophistication.  But that’s only on the surface; it’s also lacking in pretension.  Albany doesn’t demand from me more than I can give.  Albany helped me find a job, and understands that sometimes I prefer cuddling on the couch to sipping martinis at Vision.  Albany remembers my name, knows who I am.  You’re so busy rushing back and forth that sometimes I don’t even think you see me.  And that’s the most important thing in the end.  Simply put: Albany isn’t as busy as you are.  You’re so jammed with a steady stream of traffic coming in and out your door, Atlanta.  And these people just keep coming, crowding me out of your life.  But Albany makes time for me and I love Albany for that.  So, I’m leaving on Monday.  I’m moving in with Albany for a while.  I’ll be back in late October to pick up my stuff.  I hope that you can understand why I have to leave.  It’s time for me to grow, and the only way that I can do that is to put some distance between us.  I hope that we can still be friends.  Please know that you will always be one of the most important things in my life and that I will never forget what we have shared.  I love you more than you will ever know.    Forever,  Curvy P.S.- I’ll let you know if things don’t work out between us.  ;)

       Legal News or a Short Trip   There's something that's been consuming me lately.  A sort of nameless dread that numbs my fingers and toes and is the cause of my stomach's current acrobatic prowess.  My future may or may not be about to officially begin.  After four years of college, four years of law school, and an unfortunate amount of debt, I was sure that I was ready for this moment.  In fact, I would have killed for it about 3 months ago.  I knew as I walked across that stage in May, that I was walking into my adulthood.  I was no longer on the cusp of "not a girl, not yet a woman," rather, I was moving into a phase where a job with benefits was the goal and the only phone calls I would be making to my parents were hear about the joys of retirement, not to direct them to the nearest Western Union.  But today it's a different story.  Tomorrow I will find out if I'm moving.  To Albany.  Georgia.  If you've never heard of it, that's okay.  I hadn't heard of it either until last month.  My possible future boss told me that I had the job, but that my future job is contingent on a vacancy opening up by a man named Troy.  Troy has an interview at 10 a.m. on Tuesday . . . as in this Tuesday.  And by 11 a.m., my life and Troy's will either begin a new chapter, or we'll both continue writing the run-on sentence of the chapter already in progress.   I may not have the job, but my mind has been in Albany for weeks.  I spend the day pouring over apartment listings, movers, and newcomer information.  I eagerly pour over the Albany Herald online and profess shock at the presence of only one Starbucks in a town of over 30,000.  I've been furniture shopping, appliance shopping, and clothes shopping.  I've created a life in my mind and that life is firmly committed to Albany, Georgia.  And I've managed to terrify myself in the process.  I've become a poltergeist.  Not quite in one place, but rather stuck in a limbo of duality: trying to be in two places at once is emotionally draining to say the least.    I'm writing this because I know that tomorrow this will all be over.  I will have my exorcism.  I will feel the quiet relief spread throughout as I discover whether my life is beginning or continuing.  Whether I should send out those networking letters or put my hands on my hips and laugh like the conquering hero as I watch them burn in my fireplace.  But I'm not writing tomorrow.  I'm writing today.  Because it's not the end of this story that's important.  It's right now.  It's the cusp that feels the most important.  Like your first time, it's the anticipation, not the act, that you'll remember most clearly when you're rocking away the last of your years.  For years to come, I know this is what I'll remember: the trepidation, the hope, the heart wrenching mixture of fear and possibility that never fails to bring the tears rushing to my eyes when I think about it.  Because that is what's real, everything else is the stuff of legends.  As for the title of this tale: That's what my horoscope said today . . . weird huh?

       Decisions that Shouldn't Always be Made in Bed   He's back.  Of course you wouldn't know who I'm talking about.  And I'm not going to tell you.  All I can say is this man, this person, is a drug.  Two years later, two years after we slept together I can still taste him in my mouth.  It's that deep.   For a while I managed to convince myself that he was my soulmate.  Good dick will do that to you.  But I did love him.  And for that love I allowed myself to go where no self-respecting sister should ever go.  I slept with a taken man.  A man marked for marriage.  Now, I wish I could tell you that I repent.  That my sins were washed clean away as I knelt by the bed, begging God for forgiveness.  But it didn't happen.  In reality, these were the bad old days, when I could have cared less about his fiancée.  I wanted him, and that's all that mattered.    And now, two fiancées later and too many liaisons to count, he's back.  I thought my subsequent encounters and various lovers had jaded me to the feelings he used to engender in me.  I believed that I would be able to look into his eyes and see a wealth of friendship and maybe just some good dick.  Nothing more, nothing real.  And then I saw him last night.  And as we talked the years fell away and I was transformed into that naïve, gauche girl who was unable and unwilling to resist.  I even found myself gently imploring him not to go; not to go back to ex-fiancée #1's apartment and into her bed, where sex was a foregone conclusion.  We held hands and felt the heat grow between us.  At the end of the night he held me and told me how special I am to him.  He nibbled my ear and my thighs trembled.  And then he left me.    And now, in the light of day, I have realized that to let this man into my bed and back into my heart is nothing short of stupidity.  The young girl in me wants to believe in the sweet, non-committal words that he whispers in my ears, telling me of our bond and how he cherishes me.  But she is being beaten into submission by the older, wiser female in me.  The one that shakes the shit out of the girl in me and tells her that these are the words he says to every woman he's with.  That last night as he was making love to ex-fiancée #1 he whispered those same non-committal words of love and friendship and never reflected on the irony of it all as my lips touched hers with him as our middleman.    So now I know what's left for me to do.  I will quiet my trembling thighs and firmly fix my cynicism in place.  I will not let my head be swayed by what my heart and body so desperately want.  And I'll make sure to keep him at least 5 miles away from my bedroom.

       Singularly Miserable at the Lonely Hearts Club   I’ve never really had a problem being single.  In fact, I`ve prided myself on avoiding the pitfalls of the average single woman.  I condescendingly shake my head as I watch "lesser" single women out there in Atlanta clinging to any man who says hello, settling for less, and generally behaving like  Burger King (you know, letting the brotha have it "his way").  Day after day I would smile with the wisdom that I was above all of it; I was a woman reveling in my single world, patiently waiting for whatever God would eventually offer a jewel such as myself. :)   But recently, I went out with my married girlfriends.  My experience with them has since made me reevaluate being single in my skin.  We went clubbing one night, and per usual, the three of us formed the "girlfriend circle of doom" (GCOD for short).  All of you guys out there should be familiar with the GCOD; I`m sure it has wrecked much havoc on many of you trying to get your groove on.  For those who don`t know, it`s where a bunch of single girlfriends gather together in a tight circle, separating only to dance with the occasional fine guy before returning to the fold.  Not just to frustrate the h*ll out of you brothas, the GCOD serves a very real purpose; it makes single girls such as myself feel sexy and available, but untouchable and secure all at the same time.    Truth be told, this is how the first 30 minutes of the evening went, until my girlfriends decided that the music was not up to par (the dj was playing unidentifiable songs from the early 90’s) and decided to take the party upstairs. That`s when things went downhill.    Once upstairs, I found myself sitting on the outside of our triumvirate as my girls chatted and laughed about their husbands and life in general.  As I shielded my eyes to prevent being blinded by their wedding rings flashing beneath the lights, I was gripped by an emotion totally foreign to me (okay, not totally foreign, but pretty rare).  I was ridiculously jealous.  I knew that it didn’t matter if a guy danced with them or not.  They didn`t care if a brotha asked them for their number. They weren’t even interested in dancing in the "girlfriend circle of doom", because they were set . . . FOR LIFE.   I realized that somehow, while I wasn’t looking, my friends got themselves admitted into the hottest and most exclusive club in town . . . marriage.    And in realizing that they were in the married club, it also became clear to me that this was a club that I might possibly be standing outside of forever.  I might be that girl you see out in the cold, freezing her a*s off, and begging the bouncer to let her in.    I would like to say that I handled this fear like the mature, intelligent, single woman that I know I am, but if I did, I wouldn’t be writing this now, would I?  Nope, I was a grade-A b*tch.  I was one of those girls standing outside the club hating on the ones getting in: "Sure I could get in if . . . I dressed like that / flirted with the bouncer / talked to that guy who looks like Jay-Z but is on the guest list".    Along with my newfound hater status, I was also gripped with panic.  I realized that my best friend Calvin was right.  I could end up old and alone . . . with cats!  I was suddenly overcome with an overwhelming urge to go down to the dance floor, grab the first man that tried to grind with me, march him up the aisle, and say, “I do.”  It was pathetic, and I must say, not one of my prouder moments.  I would like to blame alcohol, PMS, the awful dj, or a combination of the three.  But I can’t.  The truth is, I became one of those single women that I scorned.  And the knowledge that it could happen so easily frightened me.    Two hours later, (and a very silent drive home) I found myself writing this page.  I’ve come to some realizations (or rationalizations, you make the call) in that time that I’d like to share:    1. Don’t go to a club with only your married friends; for God’s sake bring at least one single friend!  You have no one to blame but yourself if you don`t. 2. The bitter drunk girl persona is not the way to pick up guys. 3. Your friends did not get married to spite you; it’s not some giant plot to leave you as the only single person on earth.   4. Don`t go clubbing in and around Daytona Beach . . . it`s sorely lacking in nightlife.    But the most important thing that I realized is that in the morning I would wake up and be okay with my single status again.    In the end, there are benefits both large and small to being single.  My married girlfriends will never again experience the joy of having a bed completely to themselves, the freedom of not having to compromise, the ability to flirt with reckless abandon, the quiet solitude.  But most importantly, they will never again know the exhilaration of new love: the butterflies, the heat, the first rush of lust, the anticipation, and that breathless first stroke when you make love for the first time.    I know that there is a chance I might never be admitted into the married club.  And if that happens it’s okay.  Right now I’m outside, waiting, and the line`s getting closer to the door.  I know it will be my turn eventually.

       Love's Language Lessons (For Beginners)   For years, I believed I understood the language of love. I thought myself to be in the advanced class when it came to deciphering love's language. I could read it in poetry, listen to it in songs. I could so easily translate the tangle of words and come to the emotions behind them. I even donated my time to others, acting as their translator when the words became too difficult for their limited vocabulary. I spoke the language at one time, talking with my first love from night into the early hours of dawn, our voices a melody of words and meaning. Although I had not conversed in quite a while, I believed that it was only a matter of finding someone I was willing to converse with . . . getting back on the proverbial horse, so to speak.   And then I met my partner. I knew there would be some language barriers. He was much more fluent than I, had several teachers and never retired his use of the language as I had. But, I anticipated the stumbling blocks and armed myself with what I believed to be my vast study of the language. I knew it would only be a matter of time until I was speaking fluently again, until we understood each other, as only two people in love are able to do.   At first, we shared the common words: us. love. we. care. But beyond those rudimentary words there stretched a massive void of misunderstandings and frustration. Every time I opened my mouth to speak, the words tumbled out in a tangle of confusion. I couldn't conjugate my love, couldn't identify the proper forms to accompany the verbs and nouns. The little verbal cues seemed to be missing and he was speaking so fast sometimes that I often didn't hear what he was trying so hard to say. But instead of asking him to speak of his love slower, to say what I needed to hear over again, I believed that I could plod through our love.   I tried to decipher his words, but found myself concentrating on the specific. And when speaking another language it is sometimes necessary to understand the gist, the general. Otherwise you find yourself hearing "I'm settling for love with you," instead of "I'm finding myself in love with you."   I couldn't form the words into any sort of meaningful dialogue. In the end, I found myself speaking at him slowly and loudly, the last resort of a crude American in a foreign country. I knew he wasn't hard of hearing, knew that he understood my every word. I was just saying them wrong. I was a beginner, and from the looks of our relationship, I was a failing beginner at that. I was in a country surrounded by persons that spoke a language I myself could barely comprehend. Even my translators failed to make any sense of it for me. Their explanations made sense, until I found my partner and tried again. I found myself searching for words that only a moment before rolled off the tip of my tongue. Found myself resenting him for not being able to help me better, for not being able to understand my fumbling attempts. For not being able to speak my native tongue of fear and confusion. For speaking only the language of love.   I almost gave up. Almost believed that any language this difficult was not worth the time necessary to become fluent. But I realize that in life, this is something I need to pass in order to move on, to graduate. This is a required course, not just an elective. Although my language of fear and confusion has served me well, allowing me to dodge commitment, to have only the most basic of conversations, it has not assisted me in falling in love. So, I will pick up my Berlitz book and begin again. Searching into the darkness for the words and phrases that will bring my love closer to me. Seeking the words to tell him how much he means to me. Finding silence when he attempts to communicate with me. Speaking the language of love.

       . . . and Justice for All   My first mistake: I forgot about the gray area.  In law school our professors often repeated the simple truth of the legal profession: in law there is no black and white, only shades of gray.  In the field of criminal law, the shades of gray my professors spoke of are much more indistinguishable.  This week, I was gifted with the unique opportunity to attend and participate in a highly contentious, highly publicized trial of a serial rapist.  By the second day of trial, I graduated from being a spectator to sitting beside my boss, assisting him in the trial. Being that this was the first real trial I had the opportunity to participate in, I was understandably excited.   However, somewhere between the second and third day of trial, developments were occurring that were working a change in me.  And by the fourth day, I realized why my predecessor warned me not to take the work home with me; my emotions had gotten the best of me.  That evening, after trial I kept replaying scenes in my head, particularly the faces of the victims as they sat on the stand.  Some of them looked so confused.  But worst of all . . . all four of them looked at me.  They looked at me as if I could save them from all of this; as if I could help them escape the embarrassment, the cruel questions, the feeling of being victimized all over again . . . not in a boxcar or a vacant building this time, but in front of a jury of their peers.  And I couldn't do a damn thing.  I couldn't even nod my head in reassurance.  And that feeling of having to sit there, helpless, as I watched them drown remained with me. That evening, I couldn't even bear to look at my boyfriend.  I knew he was looking toward me to talk to him, to help him understand why his vibrant partner was wounded and still.  And his eyes on me, like the eyes of the victims, were too much to bear.  Instead of answering questions that I couldn’t begin to understand myself, I cloaked myself in silence and animosity, effectively shutting him out.    Despite my boyfriend sleeping on the couch that night and my silent, seething exit the following morning, I still believed that I was tough, still believed I was practical.  I counseled myself on the realities of the case: I knew that all of the defendants would not be vindicated, but I believed that even one set of guilty verdicts would ease my discontent.  I sat beside my superior tonight as the verdict was read.  And every time the words "not guilty" came out of the mouth of the judge, something inside me shifted and fell away.  I became that child again, the one that realizes there is no Easter Bunny, Santa Claus is your mother and father, and your goldfish did not move to the pond.  In other words, another piece of my innocence was destroyed tonight.    I held the tears in for as long as I could after it was over.  We won, in a way; of his four victims, the defendant was found guilty of the burglary, rape, aggravated sodomy, and kidnapping of one.  Life imprisonment.  Concurrent sentences.  Which means his first parole comes up in 14 years.  A parole that will be granted in order to make room for the more “serious” offenders.  Leaving me with the memories of those victims, looking to a person who couldn't save them.  Leaving me with a sort of survivor’s guilt.  I convinced myself that I could hold myself in until the arms of my boyfriend sheltered me from the storm inside.  Despite the fact that I had been perfectly horrible towards him, he made it clear that he would be waiting when the emotional rockslide began.  In the end, I sat in my car, pulled over on the side of the road; the clicking of hazard lights a metronome to my outpouring of sorrow for all that was lost.  Eventually, I recovered enough to let my tears trail me into the quiet solitude of my home where my sobs wouldn't echo in my ears and my tears could be wiped away by my pillowcase.  Although it’s been a horrible week, there are two things I've learned of which I would like to share: 1) I love my boyfriend.  Despite our recent kinks and the daily struggle to tamp down my commitment terror, I love him.  I looked for him, reached out for him at my most vulnerable and preferred to cry alone rather than cry with anyone else.  My realization of the love I have for this man is a silver lining on an otherwise very gray cloud.  2) Justice isn't always just.  The jury that allowed three of the victim's claims to remain unacknowledged did not see the bailiffs forcibly restrain the defendant as he ranted and raved at the judge during sentencing.  They didn't see his defense attorney move as far from her client as possible, further than even the prosecutors, choosing instead to position herself and her guilty conscience behind a podium on the other side of the courtroom.  Instead, they will go home with a pittance of a paycheck, thanking God that this week is over.  And I'll go home with the knowledge that in two months I will pick up this struggle all over again.

       Poster Child   As you know, I've recently relocated to Albany, Georgia.  And although only 2 1/2 hours away from Atlanta, it is decades away in regards to culture, things to do, shopping, etc.  In other words . . . I might as well be shacking up with the Amish.  But I have found things to do in this town.  Pardon, I mean people to do in this town.  Actually, just one person.    I've met someone.  After a 3 year hiatus that had me looking like a permanent cast member of Sex in the City, I have found someone.  And every day I'm still questioning the wisdom of it.  I can't shake the feeling that I am somehow a cameo in someone's play; I come on, say my lines, and exit stage left, making no more or less of an impression for my having been there.  He asked me out, I said "why not".  He wanted to date, I said "okay".  He asked me to be his girlfriend, I said "yes".  He asked me to spend the night, I said "sure".  He told me that he loved me, I said "me too".  See the pattern?  And in return for loving a virtual stranger, I have opened myself up to a whole new world of complications and blessings.  His friends are my acquaintances.  I've become a part of his business, both present and future.  I have this romantic love I claimed that I always wanted to be a part of.  He writes me songs and calls me beautiful.  My best friend has taken to calling me "The Poster Child for Relocation".    But in the midst of this is a vague sense of unease.  I'd like to chalk it up to my commitment phobia rearing it's ugly head, but I can't be totally sure my feelings aren't valid.  I realize that paradise has its problems.  His friends are my acquaintances . . . until they start to become my friends.  He is the perfect combination of needy and aloof, which is to say that his behavior is driving me the perfect distance into insanity.  He snores like my mother, sending me scrambling for another room or earplugs unless I have the opportunity to fall asleep before him.  My commitment phobic, independent, sharp tounged former self appears to have headed for the hills and left no forwarding address.    Worst of all, I've stopped dreaming.  Now this last one I didn't realize until I had the rare opportunity to sleep alone.  And when I did I dreamed.  Now I won't be the one to say this man has taken my dreams away from me.  That's a little too symbolic even for an English major such as myself.  What I will say is that my poster child is on the thin side and Sally Struthers is her sponsor.    But I will put away my magic 8 ball that tells me us being together in December is "not likely" and continue to bind myself to this man who is anything less than perfection.  I will either turn my cameo into a starring role a la Heather Locklear on "Melrose" or I will exit stage left.  I'll let you know how it goes.

       Broken   Somehow, while I was away for Christmas, I was broken up with.  I found out in the usual way, via a friend of a friend of my now ex-boyfriend.  My best friend says that I should be furious, that I should be horrified that he couldn't "come at me like a man" and do the dirty deed face to face.  She believes that I should chew him out for having to find out from a disinterested (well, not quite) third party.  But I'm not going to chew him out, because I'm relieved.  Actually, I'm elated.  Although I will admit that his methodology was seriously flawed, bordering on cowardice, I must say that he bravely did the one thing I was seemingly unable to do.  Break up.  I had been trying for the last two weeks.  But every time I would sit down to say the words, every time I was on the verge, I would falter.  Later, as I was walking away, or waking up, I would chastise myself, angry that I couldn't say such a simple thing.  It was obvious even to him that I was unhappy.  He could see that in the end I wished that I were anywhere else but in his presence.  But even with the knowledge of that there in his eyes, I couldn't break up and break his heart.  I found a thousand excuses for why.  I convinced myself that I could wait until Christmas, until I could give him his gifts.  Then I extended that date to New Year's, to give him a chance to recover from the oppressive air of depression that seemed to surround him during the holidays.  Then I convinced myself that I could wait until after Valentine's Day, or at least until the "Under the Cherry Moon" poster I bought him had come in.  (In case you're reading this, yes, I did get the poster for you, and no, I'm not as generous as you were with your last ex-girlfriend.  It will look very nice on my wall).  The way I was going I would have convinced myself into a yearlong relationship.  But on the drive to Atlanta, I realized that this had to be done.  I knew it had to end.  Everyone in my family just reinforced my resolve.  Shouts of "leave his ass" and offers from my cousin to hook me up before I had even broken up will do that to a girl.  But still I worried.  It's easy to break up with your family and friends surrounding you, but how easy is it to look at the person you care for and say it?  And is it bad taste to have my family there for encouragement when I break up with him?  Obviously he found this just as hard.  But he did relieve me of the onerous responsibility and for that I'm thankful.  I think he knew what I was going to do, where this was headed and wanted to beat me to the punch.  Or maybe he knew what I knew: that the friendship was more important and if there was ever a chance of us continuing as friends, we needed to end the relationship as soon as possible.  Maybe he knew that I didn’t have the courage to complete the task.  Maybe he’s just a pitifully depressed man that didn’t have the guts to face his real problems and own up to them.  Whatever it was, he left me broken.  But I’m broken in the best possible way, because I’ve broken away from him.

       Lost and Found   There are some things I will never understand.  How a laugh can feel better than a kiss.  How the comfort of a friend can give you more than the touch of a lover.   How the loneliness you feel when someone is away is more enriching than the fullness of his or her presence.  I'm cleaning house, in all senses.  I'm realizing that right now I need responsibility, respect, and love.  And those are things that I've felt more keenly in three years of alone than two months of together.  My love graces me with his absence, but my phone's ring is a distant echo, because he didn't grace me with an explanation.  But I find comfort in the familiar distancing, the feeling of slow detachment.   I know he won't understand.  I don't understand myself why my presence in his life means so little that a phone call seems redundant or unnecessary.  But I understand what needs to be done.  Thinking about the past, past relationships, past reasoning, past hurt.  I write this to remind me of the things that I’ve learned . . . and appear to still be learning.    Learned  I turned my words inside out for you Trying to fit to your ideal  Transforming into the things you could never say And I learned love  Lost my appetite when you were hungry Starved myself when you were full I wanted to be your only sustenance  And I learned sacrifice  I was your vessel Your temple and your muse Growing emptier when filled by you And I learned selfishness  I grew tired of being your shadow Always standing behind you With you forever facing the sun And I learned loneliness  Breaking the tenuous thread  Making “us” a “me” and “you” I retreat into myself And relearn the art of sleeping alone

       Ring the Bell   I should have known in that moment's hesitation before I said yes, that I would be in this position.  When my current asked me to be his, irrevocably setting us on the road to a relationship, I paused.  Everything inside me just stopped.  And I knew what my answer should have been.  But I looked at the proud man sitting before me at the Waffle House and I convinced myself that we didn't need time, we had passion.  I believed that was enough.  Fast forward two months . . . I'm on the phone with an ex, trying to decode the mystery of our previous relationship.  Because I know something is inherently wrong with the one I'm in now.  I know this because the anticipation I feel thinking about my partner is matched only by the frustration I feel when I'm with him.   After speaking to several of my friend-exboyfriend-friends, I realized that a couple of things are missing.  Talk and friendship.  Don't get my wrong, we communicate.  We communicate about our feelings, thoughts, etc.  But we don't sit and talk.  There is a difference.  Talk is surface, communication is deep.  I never thought I'd say this, but I think my relationship is too deep.  We've spent so much time communicating, that we don't talk.  We've never spoken about politics, art, music (other than his own), love (other than ours), life (other than our own before we met).  With both of the serious loves in my life, I can recall staying up all night just talking.  And although my bedtime has radically changed, I know that the importance of that has not.  The problem becomes much like one where a couple isn't having sex.  Eventually one or both go looking outside the relationship.  In other words: I'm talking with other people.  Well, one person in particular.   Every couple of days we get together and hang out.  Often our conversations are no deeper than a kiddie pool, and I love that.  And although I don't consider him a prospect, I am willing to bet that this person knows more about me than my partner does.  Sometimes while talking to someone about nothing, you learn everything about them.    The other side of this is friendship.  As I talked to my ex, I had a blinding realization (well not so blinding in that I realized it about a month ago): I don't consider my current my friend.  I consider him my boyfriend but not my best friend.  Not even close.  By no means were my past relationships perfect, but no matter how screwed up my other relationships were, the people in them were my friends.  We genuinely liked each other as people, the attraction was secondary.  That's the reason one calls me at 11 p.m. from his job just to see how I'm doing.  That's the reason the other one tells me he misses whipping my ass in online Jeopardy.  We're still friends, because we were friends first.  Don't get me wrong, I don't believe in the whole "friends first" idea in the strict sense.  I have plenty of guy friends (okay, 2) that I wouldn't date for fear that I would jeopardize the friendship.  Rather, I am talking about taking the opportunity to enjoy something about the person other than the way they make you feel in a relationship.  We were so busy seeing a prospect in each that we somehow missed seeing a friend.  And now I fell like I'm dating a stranger, not someone I can joke with, talk to, be friends with.    But I'm not quite sure how to accomplish this without losing him.  I spoke to my friend about it and he said that trying to go backward is impossible.  "You can't un-ring the bell," he said between surgery calls.  "If you tell him you just want to be friends for awhile, you're going to lose him."  But I know that no matter what I do there is the possibility that I'll lose him.  I can't continue another day, much less another couple of months, without learning how to build a friendship with this complex man.  But I know what I have to do now. I need my lover to be my friend, not just my boyfriend.   I know that none of this is his fault because I have allowed for all of it with my own behavior.  And I won't continue another day being someone I despise.  I need him to see the woman I am, not the pathetic, constantly apologetic, girlfriend I've become. I need sleep.  I need to stay at my place.  I need him to understand that sitting and watching him work is not my idea of a good time, it never will be.  I need to be me.  And I won't apologize for it . . .    In other words, the BITCH is back . . .

       What's Love Got to Do With It?   "Fuck me."  I've always loved those two words.  In fact, when I was a virgin, I dreamed of the day that I could whisper that to my lover in a restaurant, a bar, or other public place; make my excuses to my friends, and proceed to have him fulfill my request and fill me.    So imagine my surprise when my last boyfriend announced that hearing the word out of a female's mouth made him less that ready to go (if you get my drift).  I looked at him as though he had given me a puppy and then taken it away.  Is this the same man who I just caught watching "Big Booty Hoes 23: Rumble in the Rump Jungle"?  The same man who believes it's no fun without handcuffs?    How can any grown person not get slip and slide wet at the mere  mention  of those two words? After thorough questioning, he admitted that the words bothered him because they didn't gel with the act which he and I were performing.  In his eyes, we were making love, not  fucking.   Awwww.  Don't get me wrong.  I did love him.  Still do (although I'll never actually admit that to him).  And when we were having sex, I did feel a deep loving connection with him.  I felt love.  But in my eyes, making love to him is something I did every day.  I did it with every kind act, every selfless motivation, every time I picked out something from the store for him just because.  That was my lovemaking.  What we did every night in bed had nothing to do with the days I spent thinking of him.  Especially that time with the midget.  Maybe it's me.  Maybe I'm a product of too much "Sex and the City", too much MTV and Cinemax Saturday nights.  Call me new fashioned, but I feel like a participant in a cheap romance novel when I whisper "Make love to me."  To me, those words just take too damn long.  They don't convey the urgency, the need, the animal lust I felt when I watched him walk across the room.  When I dragged him into the bedroom during his birthday party, I wasn't trying to "make love" to him.  I wanted to fuck the shit out of him.  Maybe when I'm 50 I'll want a man to make love to me.  I'll also want Metamucil and a nice nap too.  But right now, I want to fuck.

       Crack Dick   I know this is a pretty unusual title, but then again it’s a pretty unusual subject.  See, I have this theory.  Some of you men out there are possessed with the most dangerous dick in the world: crack dick.  Basically, crack dick is dick that is so good it makes women lose their minds.  The women become veritable fiends, living day to day for the next hit.  They let their men get away with damn near anything.  And when the man possessed of this dick finally leaves the woman . . . well, you don’t want to see the withdrawal period.  Now, some of you men know who you are, and some of you are just deluding yourselves.  But believe me, we women know who you are.  And we’re afraid of you.  Most every woman has fallen prey to crack dick at least once; it’s damn near an epidemic.  But for those ten women out there who have not been acquainted with crack dick, let me break it down for you.  These are the signs that the man you know but haven’t hit yet may have crack dick.  As a friend to four guys with crack dick, and having, ummmm, personal knowledge of one of them, I can safely say I am almost an expert in this field.  So, here goes:       Five Signs of Crack Dick   1.  The Silent Treatment:  Crack dick doesn’t brag.  In fact, they are eerily closed mouthed about their dick; they show an almost total lack of concern for their package.  They don’t discuss their exploits, they don’t hint at how good they are, and they probably don’t even know what size they are.    2.  All about You:  Most men with crack dick show more interest in you than in their own pleasure.  But don’t confuse them with those crass guys who claim they can go downtown all night or ask to lick your (insert word here) before the entrée at your first date dinner is served.  Crack dick guys make cryptic statements such as: “I just like to make her happy” or “I just want you to feel good”.  And 3 out of 5 crack dick men  aren’t obsessed with getting head (says one of my crack dick friends: “I just don’t see what all the fuss is about”).  3.  And You Say She’s Just a Friend:  Most crack dick men have a fan club that rivals some movie stars.  Seriously, all they need is a wandering troubadour singing their exploits.  But instead of the troubadour, you will meet several of his female friends.  All of whom have probably fucked him.  Now the difference between a playa and true crack dick is the female friends.  Playas: No matter how good of a playa you are, you will not have female friends (who’ve fucked you) if the dick is just okay.  We will move on for better dick, but may call you for the occasional booty call.  But if the guy has crack dick, he will have female friends hanging out with him 24-7 who are just hoping that he will change his mind and hit them up one more time.  4.  Back Down Memory Lane:   As I said above, crack dick has a following.  But it also has women popping up from as far back as grade school.  One of my crack dick friends had a girl from high school call him to say that she was getting married, but before she did she had to hit him off one more time.  He’s 27 and lives in Atlanta.  She lived in New Jersey.   But for a man with crack dick, every day is like his high school reunion.  So beware of the man who has females they haven’t spoken to in over 3 years calling to say hello.  It’s the dick.    5.  Crazy . . . Deranged:  This is the most important sign, and will only be witnessed if you hang around long enough.  Every once in awhile, your crack dick friend will cut off a girl’s supply.  And this girl, who you once thought was the most intelligent, non-ghetto, logical girl you knew will promptly lose her effin’ mind.  She will call all times of night, and try anything to get him back.  She will even beg.  Hell, I wrote a ten-page letter to my crack dick . . . and read it over his answering machine. My crack dick friend hit two girls at the same time, who also happened to be best friends.  When they found out they confronted him; not to kick his ass, but to ask him choose.  If he’s been screwing her for three years then it’s love.  But if he met her three weeks ago, then it isn’t love . . . it’s crack dick.  Well, there you have it.  Let me add that the man in question must meet all five criteria to qualify for crack dick.  If you see a man who meets these criteria . . . run.  I know, you think, “It can’t really be that good” or “I’ll just do it one time”.  Well, let me tell you, there is no such thing as one time and it is really that good. But for those of you who insist on trying it . . . good luck. And watch out for the withdrawal.  P.S.: Gentlemen, if you email me to tell me that you have crack dick, then you`ve already missed one of the requirements for having crack dick.  Which means you probably don`t.  Get it? Got it? Good.

       Withdrawal   Last night I officially said "au revoir" to my crack dick.  Although I have acted this scene out several times before, this time really felt final.  Which leaves me in a dire place . . .   I'm a crack-dick-head.  Smokers have the patch.  Alcoholics have 12 step programs and Betty Ford Clinics.  Heroin addicts have methadone.  Coke addicts have 28-day programs.  Hell, even Pookie from 'New Jack City' had help.  But what is there for those unfortunate women, and if you swing that way, men who have lost the best piece of dick known to womankind, the holy grail of penis?  There should be Dick-orette.    Or at least some form of the popular patch.  See, I'm a proponent of the gradual step-down method of crack dick freedom.  I believe that no woman can go from four to five orgasms a week to nothing but Netflix and vibrators.  It just isn't right.  Since many of you ladies have suffered from the same malady, I offer myself as an example of the "what to do's" and the "what the hell to stay away from’s" of crack dick withdrawal.  So presented below in five easy steps (because 12 steps are just too hard) is my Curve's Clinic for Crack Dick Freedom:   Step 1, Week 1:  Don't officially break up yet. *   This is key.  There is absolutely no sense in cutting off your supply until it is absolutely necessary.  During this week you should plan to get little rest.  Remember that week you saved up to go to Venice?  This is more important.     *Little Known Fact:  Crack dick doesn’t break up with you.  Crack dick would never sacrifice sex for something as trivial as relationship incompatibility.  So, if you were broken up with, you weren’t dating crack dick.  I don’t know what to tell you.   Step 2, Week 2:  You still shouldn't do the deed.  Instead, begin weaning yourself away from the dick.  Try to go at least two days in a row without seeing him.  Because let's face it, if you see him you're going to fuck him.  Use the time you are with him to do every little freaky thing you've always wanted to try.  Wanted to do it doggy style on his cute little covered terrace?  Now is the time.  Standing up in his recording booth?  Make like Prince and record your moans today.     Step 3, Week 3: Hopefully you've managed to go the two days without him last week.  If not, then I encourage you to repeat week 2.  Please do not use your failure as an excuse to keep repeating week 2.  For those of you who managed two whole days without an orgasm, congratulations.  In week 3, I encourage you to do a little shopping.  Get those items which you'll need to tide you over for the next couple of months.  I recommend vibrators, a few dirty movies, and a call to a reliable secondary dick.  You heard me right.  Start talking up those guy friends of yours who can supply you with regular, unmemorable dick for the next month or so.  Put their number on your phone's emergency button (you probably won't need the police anytime soon anyway).  As for the crack dick, try spending three days without him.  And when you do talk to him, be vague and standoffish.  Yeah, I know we're supposed to be beyond these games, but this is crack dick we're talking about here.  It's a special case.  Have sex with him on the other four days, but make sure to go home immediately after it's over.  For some of you, that won't be hard if you're dating crack dick that kicks you out.  For others, resist the urge to cuddle up and go to sleep, even if you know there's breakfast the next morning.  What's more important, self respect of waffles?  Take thee to IHOP.   Step 4, Week 4: Time for the break up.  I attempt to postpone this for as late in the week as possible.  Take the first four days off without seeing him.  Fuck like crazed rabbits on Friday and Saturday, and then drop the bomb on Sunday.   Store up as much as you can, little squirrel, 'cause it's gonna be a cold winter.   Take this time to remember all of the things that you love about his body.  Memorize every inch of him.  You'll need this for later when you're sleeping with unmemorable guy.  On the day you do the deed, don't sleep with him.  It will just set you back two weeks.  Just do it and get the hell out of dodge.  Have girlfriends on standby at your house with instructions that they are to come to his house if you don't return in an hour.  If you're like me, you can break up, get a quickie in, and get back to your home with no one the wiser.     Step 5, Week 5: The supplies you purchased in Week 2 will come in handy right about now.  If you're like me, you'll end up vibrating yourself into oblivion this week while sobbing his name.  Pathetic, but true.  Try to be strong.  Avoid places you know he will be.  Or if you live in a small town, stay in this week.  There's nothing you need to see out there, anyway.  If you absolutely need to, call unmemorable dick.  I advise against this in the initial weeks, because you could end up in a serious relationship with boring dick.  And that's worse than being latched to crack dick for the rest of your life.  Take this time to rediscover yourself.  Take yoga, or any other relaxing exercise.  For God's sake do not take strip classes or belly dancing, it will only make you want to call crack dick and show him what you learned.  Well, you've done it!  You have made it through Curvy's 5 Week Program.  My final piece of advice to you: Should you slip and have sex with him, don't beat yourself up about it.  Just end it as soon as possible before you put yourself in grave danger.  Remember what happened to Pookie.

      ( Pre-Script:  I know two posts in one day may seem excessive, but what can I say, with a social life comes inspiration.  You’ve survived the drought  uptownbrowngirl  let’s see if you can handle the flood.)   The “Ex” Factor   I recently saw my ex at a club that he plays at and that I occasionally frequent.  Seeing him there filled me with a myriad of confusing feelings, piled on each other so tightly I could barely discern them: awkwardness, fear, disgust, lust . . . and another unnamed emotion.    The first four are par for the course.  After a breakup I’m always left looking over my shoulder, waiting for the other party to pop up and ambush me.  And as it is in the rest of my "Murphy's Law" life, it always seems to happen when I’m wearing sweats, my hair is complete crap, and I’m sporting my trademark “I can prove I’m not pretty,” glasses.  I plan out what I’m going to do should I run into an ex and they (gasp!)  approach me .  I’m often reduced to two choices: the scornful cut direct (which I’ve fantasized about never had the ovaries to actually  do ), or the overly cheerful “Hi,” said in a screechy tone a good two octaves higher than my normal speaking voice.  This time, however, I was ready.  I looked good, had a cute, innocuous (although my ex will never know that) male acquaintance on my arm, and was genuinely (no really, this guy was funny) laughing my ass off.  And although my ex came close to pulling off  my  never-preformed scornful cut direct, I am proud to say the crisis was averted and my “Hi,” was only one octave higher, which in my world is an unmitigated success.     But that night I was left with a somewhat unfamiliar emotion in addition to the usual suspects.  I was a child again with a missing tooth, prodding at the hollowed socket with my tongue, testing for pain or discomfort and marveling at the strange emptiness where there was once something tangible.  I went through my checklist: Am I in love with him?  No.  Love him? No.  Miss him?  Sorta.  I miss the him he used to be, I can't tolerate the him he became.  And I'm being honest up to a point.  I was never  in love  with him, but before it got bad I felt the pull.  I don’t love him anymore, but I still care.  And worst of all (or best of all depending on the day) I still find myself residually involved with him in thousands of tiny ways that his life intersects with mine.  And when this happens I find myself wondering if he’s okay, if he’s hungry, if he’s tired, if he’s sad . . . if he needs me.  And although I get the occasionally volunteered information, I never ask how he’s doing.  No matter how much I scheme to casually inject it into a conversation (“That was a great movie.  My ex would have loved it.  How is he by the way?”).  The reason I’m on the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy is this: although I wish I could be there for him, I know the truth.  He’s not thinking about me, not even a little bit.  Or so I’m constantly reminded by friends and well-intentioned (and not so well-intentioned) acquaintances.  And I know that even by reaching out a centimeter, I am opening myself up to a person who has become so completely self-involved that I in the end I was an accessory to him, like a bracelet or a necklace, but not like a real partner.  Yes, it hurts me when he looks through me and not at me, or speaks to the person closest to me without ever acknowledging my presence.  And although I know that I’m conveniently forgetting the fact that I’m the one who said I couldn’t do this anymore (but in my defense, I didn’t mean forever!), I also know in my heart of hearts, in my truest self, that it’s not time.    We’re not ready to be friends.  And that’s hard to deal with.  Because in reality, I get along great with most of my ex-boyfriends.  Granted, I don’t have a 100% success rate, but I’m not doing too shabby.  I would like to believe that all of my exes are honestly and truly my friends, with no ulterior motives or intentions.  But that’s not quite true.  In fact, I believe that most of your former exes-cum-friend fall into one of four categories. *      *  For those of you who don’t see your ex/friend in one of these categories, let me just say that they are.  Trust me on this . . .   1.  The Best Friend Ex/Friend:  So extremely rare that I think it’s on the endangered species list.  This is the miracle friendship wherein two people break up, take the requisite time to heal, and then proceed to become closer than brother and sister.  Contrary to current wisdom, the breakup does not have to be amicable.  In fact, it can be downright ugly.  What’s important to this almost impossible equation is that the two people genuinely liked each other pre-dating.  Not physical attraction, loneliness, or sexual desperation; but rather, a genuine respect and affection.  This would be my first ex.  We didn’t speak after my ultra-heinous (and completely unsuitable) replacement threw down an ultimatum: her or me.  Of course, as any thinking man (with his dick) would do, he chose her.  And I loathed him for it.  Two years later (and expensive, extensive amounts of therapy) we talk twice a week, share our deepest secrets, and he vets all my posts before I’m stupid enough to put them up for the world to see.  Now, that’s trust.  2.  The Ruse Ex/Friend:  A little more commonplace.  There are actually two species of Ruse Ex/Friend: Type A: This ex that may appear to be your friend but is secretly attempting to reconcile the relationship.  Type B: The more common of the two, may appear to be your friend but is secretly attempt to ensure that you are miserable without them.  They both however, share the same telltale signs:  a) They call to “check-in” and one of the first questions they ask is about your love life.    b) If you’re currently in a relationship, they want to give you advice . . . about how this new person is all wrong for you.    c) They can barely conceal their glee when you explain to them that your relationship is going down the crapper, or that your idea of a fun Friday night is reading “The Art of War” and eating Ben & Jerry’s.    d) They make frequent, and seemingly random trips down memory lane and always filled with happy stories of how the two of you worked so well together.    If that sounds familiar, then either your ex is trying to get you back, or the ex is trying to ensure their number one spot on your relationship “Top Ten.”  And don’t go into denial on me.  Try this test: If you find yourself getting a little tingle when you ask your ex, “How’s (insert name of heinous partner here)?” and they sigh, you aren’t friends.  You’re on layaway.  This would be my third ex/friend.  It got so bad at one point, that he had me convinced that we were perfect for each other and I really messed up.  Until I remembered the distance (nearly 13 hours and several states away) and the problems (like the fact that we were dating while he was dating another girl).  In fact, wasn't he the first one cheering me on to my current break-up?  And didn't he just break it off with his girlfriend?  Coincidence?  I don't think so.    3.  The Familiar Ex/Friend:   I mean, honestly, why are you hanging on?  The two of you rarely see each other and barely speak.  And those times that one of you gets up the energy to dial the other persons digits, its five minutes of conversation and thirty minutes of breathing.  Unless you have unlimited long distance, I’d put your money, and your minutes, to better use.  The reality is that this ex/friend does serve a purpose.  They’re kind of like your touchstone to an old life.  There is a friend, memory, or something that you’re holding on to and this person is the only road left to that location.  This would be my second ex/friend.  I’m ashamed to admit it, but I think the only reason we still speak is because I think his best friend is a riot.  And the only way to spend time with his best friend (and not look like an evil hag) is too spend time with him as well.  Hey, you take the bitter with the sweet.  4.  The Angry Ex/Friend:   Too common to speak on, but I’ll try.  You’ve broken up, a barely a fortnight later (two weeks for you commoners), you’re trying to be best buds.  Now, I don’t care how great the relationship was or how well you ended.  Say it with me now: It’s just not going to work.  Why?  Because at the heart of it, you aren’t ready to be friends.  The open wound that was your love has not crusted over with the scabby scales of time.   Ewwwww.    So what your left with are two people desperately trying to appear to take the moral high ground, while covertly (or not so covertly) mud slinging like crazy.  In fact, there’s more hypocrisy in this type of relationship than in the 2004 presidential election.  This was my last ex.  Too often we found ourselves vacillating between being friends and bitter, contentious exes.  And the old crap that we dug up on each other . . . let’s just say that I almost had him pegged as the second shooter on the grassy knoll.  Despite the many warnings, I plugged on until it became apparent that it just wasn’t working.  Now this is not to say things can’t be salvaged.  I’m a big believer in God bringing people into your life for a reason.  I’m just saying that you can’t see the reason through the rose-colored glasses of rage and betrayal.  My first boyfriend and I took two years and one of us relocating out of the county to get back on speaking terms.   Anything  is possible.  So, here I am, picking through the rubble of yet another failed relationship, trying to find something salvageable.  And although the urge to throw it in is tempting, I look at these people in my world, the lovers who have come before.  And I realize that they have all changed me and continue to change me in so many ways.  So, I guess I’ll keep searching through the wreckage for signs of life.

       The Madonna/Madonna Complex   In this life, it seems that a woman is sometimes forced to choose between two equally evil options: be the Madonna or be Madonna.  Let me explain.  Post breakup, I've been the Madonna.  As in the Virgin Mary.  I've been chaste, pure, and honest.  And I'm ready to kill myself.  Because the reality is, if this were anywhere else, if I was anyone else, I'd be fucking right now.  My secret motto: "The only way to get over dick is to get some dick."  My philosophy is a little more Samantha than Carrie (God rest "Sex in the City's" soul) in that respect.  Unfortunately, I'm in a small town.  A very small town.  Where everyone knows each other and (unfortunately) everyone knows my ex.  So, although I could start a fling up, I believe that it could only end in my being branded with the scarlet letter and driven out by the Puritans.    At first it wasn't hard, because let's face it, I wasn't leaving the house.  But now I'm besieged by offers and everything in me is telling me to take advantage, to "Carpe dick" so to speak.  At the same time I feel that some type of mourning period is in effect.  In a town this small, things revert back to the 18th century.  People are expected, no demanded, to follow some sort of protocol.  To abstain from sex until some arbitrary period in time when you get the all clear to get laid.  And knowing how fast word travels, I also know that if I remove this mourning gown even a day before it's time, I'll be "that random ho."  So I'm putting my panties back on a pasting a complacent smile on my face in the meantime.  I'm hanging out with a new bevy of male "friends," and struggling not to seem too close to any of them at this point.  I'm being so good that if I were a believer in being a "born again virgin" I would swear that my hymen was repairing itself as we speak.    Don't get me wrong; I'm not a sex fiend.  Okay, I am.  But I've managed to keep it in check.  In the Madonna/Madonna complex, I've managed to stay firmly on the side of the Virgin Mary.  I waited until almost 22 to have sex.  And afterward, I was always obsessed about my number of lovers, making sure that I didn't exceed some imaginary quota.  I lived in constant fear that should I ever get married, it would be the first question the pastor would ask me at the altar and my answer would decide whether the ceremony could continue.  I waited for potential boyfriends to ask so I could tout my low statistics like I was pitching a product: "I'm the new girlfriend, with 30% less sex partners than the original!"    But a recent phenomenon has occurred.  I've stopped caring about my number.  I've stopped obsessing.  Why this couldn’t have happened in Atlanta, where random dick is plentiful and you can go two years without seeing your ex, is beyond me.  But here I am on the horns of a dilemma.  Yes, I want to be wifey.  But I also want a life . . . a sex life.  And deep down inside I want to be Madonna.    Not the children's-book-writing, director-marrying, fake-British-accent-having, Kabbalah-bracelet-wearing Madonna.  I want to be the Madonna who thought there was nothing better than to fuck Dennis Rodman, write a book about it, and sell her sex life for $50.  I want to be the Madonna that Britney Spears is a headlong rush to become.  I want to be the Madonna who believed that the only thing better than a strong, successful woman was a strong, successful woman who liked sex: anytime, anyplace, anywhere.  Preferably on camera with a midget.  And that Madonna says, "fuck a number, just get fucked."  In that vein, Madonna is currently trying to kill the Madonna.  As we speak she's holding her head underwater.   	 Because of my internal struggle, I'm finding myself having moments.  Here's an example of my new and twisted, bad-girl rationalization: If my ex knows everyone in this town, then it shouldn't matter whom I have sex with.  Therefore, his friends aren't off limits, because everybody’s his friend.  Either way I’ll get a reputation.  Yes, this is the same rationale you used in high school: If I break curfew I'm going to be grounded, so I might as well drive to Tijuana, get a tattoo, and stay out 'til dawn.  As a result, the Madonna sits with her "friends" laughing and talking at a polite distance while Madonna is wondering how their tongue would feel in her mouth.  The Madonna is going out with her female friend to Wal-Mart and buying potted plants, while Madonna makes sure to walk past the condom aisle to see if Magnum XL's are in stock.  But I digress.  The reality is I'm going to eventually have to choose.  I will have to face vilification or continue to rely on my new shower massage for entertainment.  I will have to choose the peasant blouse or the titty top.  I will have to decide between PBS or Cinemax: After Dark.  I will have to be the virgin or the whore.  Luckily that day isn't here just yet . . .

       How Come You Don't Call Me Anymore?   Lately, I've been feeling isolated.  Well, that's a polite way of putting it.  Lately, I've been feeling like an absolute loser.  I feel like I'm on the world's "Do Not Call" list.  To date, in the six months since I've been here in Albany, I've made one friend, three acquaintances, one ex-boyfriend, and a whole lot of shady, backstabbing associates.  All I need now is the partridge in a pear tree.  And every day I come home from my eight hours hoping and praying that my phone's message light is blinking.  I don't care who it is; I just want to believe that someone cares if I'm still breathing.  Even if that person is calling to tell me how to consolidate my credit card debt into one low, monthly payment.    Granted, I didn't believe that I was going to take Albany by storm.  Okay, that's a bald faced lie.  I just knew that after six months in this town I'd be on everyone's guest list, adored by men and detested by women.  So maybe I was ego-tripping a little.  Or a lot.  But I expected things to be different.  And for a while it seemed that I was headed in that direction.  It was like you dreamed the first day of high school would be.  Somehow I managed to stumble into a relationship with the most popular guy in school and believed for a moment that I could actually be Homecoming Queen.  But somewhere I took a wrong turn and ended up at the back table with the Trekkies and the Chess Club.    I expected things to be like they were in Atlanta.  I had friends there, people that cared about me too much to let me be alone on a Friday night.  People who knew that "friends don't let friends wear that outfit."  The mind's a funny thing that way.  I've conveniently forgotten that it took me over two years to reach that point.  I've forgotten that during my first year in Atlanta, I stood between Spelman and Morehouse and yelled that I should have gone to a white school (something that my friends will  never  let me forget).  I forgot that the second year was spent isolated and angry, a big change from the naive, overeager and yes, slightly (very) obnoxious girl that I was my freshman year.  I've even manage to forget that should you have asked me that second year what my friend status was, I would have said that I've made one friend, three acquaintances, one ex-boyfriend, and a whole lot of shady, backstabbing associates.   It's not that my friends back home don't call, they do.  But unless I can convince Patty or Traci to give up New York and Atlanta, respectively, and move down here, I'm screwed.  Or unless I can convince Flossie or Rachel to divorce their husbands and cohabitate with me, I'm screwed.  They're my friends, true, but they can't, and won't, make my transition in Albany any easier.  I have to live down here.  And although the urge to drive back to "civilization" where the streets don't roll up at 10 p.m., there's more than one Starbucks, and the stylists have never heard of "Pink Oil Sheen," is nearly overwhelming, I know that I can't give up.  The problem was I became complacent.  Eight years of stability and friendship made me soft.  Granted, I never enjoyed the nomadic lifestyle that was my childhood, but at least it kept me sharp.  Getting back into the swing of things post-Atlanta has been brutal.  I am something that I haven't been since college.  I'm the new girl.  And unlike college, where everyone was on new and unfamiliar territory, I'm experiencing this solo.  The people in Albany have had their friends, lovers, and intrigue long before I came on the scene.  Let me be more specific: on the airline of life, I'm the hot towel.  Although I'm an interesting addition, I’m working on a “take it or leave it basis” with people who have established their friend base.  And now, come hell or high water, I have to establish mine.    So, I'm going to try to do what I managed to do in Atlanta, hopefully with a whole lot less angst, a lot more personal dignity, and in less than two years.  I will put down the phone and stop calling people like a stalker.  I won't be what I'm not.  I will start eating out alone again instead of waiting for someone to take pity on me and take me out.  I won't compromise. I will learn to enjoy the silence and learn to enjoy myself.  I won't keep trying to be friends with people who I wouldn't give the time of day, or my time to, if I lived back in Atlanta.  I will be strong.    I'll stop watching that fucking message light, and start living my life.

       Regrets and Reality   I try not to have regrets.  I believe they're bad for business.  The business of being Curvy, that is.  I always believed that if I were real with myself, I would never suffer regrets.  Or that if I viewed regrets in the light of day I would realize that some regrets are, in reality, not regrets at all.  Which makes this even harder to put down on this blog.   I am regretting two decisions I made.  They're coming back to bite me in the ass in a way that I didn't believe was possible.  And of course, they were relationships (must go for consistency after all).    So let's start out with the first: my sister.  In a couple of days it will be a year since my sister and I have talked.  Technically that's not entirely true.  We've exchanged pleasantries: wished each other's answering machines "Happy Birthday" and wished each other plastic "Merry Christmas-es" but we haven't  talked  in a year.  I could rehash the details of the fallout, the reasons, and the revelations.  But the reality is that I can't.  I know the details, the clinical layout, the precise time that we stopped communicating.  But I don't know why.  Family is, and always will, have theories to breakdowns in communication such as this one.  Like scientists they gather with a hypothesis and see if it will float.  But the truth is, they don't even know.  And all I know is that one day I woke up without a sister.  And I regret that.  I regret the fact that there is something between us that will not allow us to pull it together and regroup.    I can't help feeling that this was a long time coming.  And that the break is necessary.  For the first time, I don't feel like I'm in the shadow of my more talented, smarter, and livelier sister.  I don't feel inferior.  Coupled with that I also feel that I don't have to be the responsible, prudent one.  I don't feel that I have to be the older sister.  I can be carefree.  I don't have to put out the fires she created, soothe the nerves she rattled, or fight the battles she instigated.  I can just be myself, whoever that person is, without wondering if it will be eclipsed by someone who is at the same time my best friend . . . and my worst enemy.  But it hurts not to have her.  Not to confide, not to laugh with someone who knew the punchline even when I fuck it up.  Who knew my heart's desire before I keenly felt it.  And who felt the knife just a sharply when my heart was wounded.  Somehow, the rest doesn't seem too important.    Almost as hard is fessing up about my second regret.  His name is Nate.  We dated in college.  Again the story isn't as important as the ending.  He lives in New Jersey and I of course, opted for Albany.  And although I'm sure he would lay money on the love of my life being my first boyfriend, he would be wrong.  It was him.  I loved him fiercely.  But I let the other things intrude.  I couldn't go to New Jersey for law school because I didn't want him to think I needed him too much.  I couldn't stay with him because he would think that I was clingy.  I couldn't take him back because he would think I was weak.  From time to time we disconnected, always at my insistence.  I believed that eventually that need wouldn’t be there, that I would wake up one day and he would be in that category of innocuous exes, comfortable and sexless.  But the day never came, and every time we started talking again, I found new things about him that I admired, that I respected . . . that I loved.  My love never died, it evolved.  And the honest point, the moment of truth was when I sat naming all the traits I wanted in a lover to a date (in my defense, he asked) and couldn’t stop thinking about Nate.  Lately I find myself wishing I could change one thing.  One decision.  One more chance.  I can't tell him how I feel, because I know it would be impossible.  I tell myself that there could be no happy ending here.  There could be no "happily ever after" with him.  How would it work?  And how could he possibly feel the same?  Well, like I said above, I’m not one for regrets, so I took things firmly in hand.  I decided I was going to wipe my eyes and get on with the business of living regret-free.  I decided to make some phone calls.  Put my pride aside and tell two of the people I loved the truth, that I had regrets.    But reality did, as it will, intrude.  After calling my best guy friend for a pep talk, I called Nate.  And heard what I expected, what I had prepared myself for: a relationship couldn’t work, the distance, the time that had passed, the mutual hurts.  I knew this script well.  But then he said something else: “If you had told me this just a couple of months earlier . . ."  That’s what hurt.  That was the line I wasn’t expecting.  To know that if I had just put my pride aside, the would-have, could-have, should-have’s, would have been reality.  But don’t cry for me.  I had no “happily ever after” but I do feel better.  I know that it wasn’t meant to be, but now I know that he knows how I felt.  I feel satisfaction at that and the falling away of my regret.  As for my sister, you may ask?  Well, just before I was to call, I checked my email.  And there was an email that in so many words asked me for legal advice for a co-worker I have never met.  And following that email was the co-worker’s email asking for the advice.  So, after not speaking for a year, my sister reaches out . . . to get free legal advice for her buddy.  A buddy she gave my email address without asking.  Second lesson learned?  Some separation, no matter how painful, is healthy.  Some growth, no matter how difficult, is normal.  Some people don’t change just because their feelings do.  And when viewed in the light of day some regrets are, in reality, not regrets at all.

       Things to Do in Albany When You're Dead   Looking at the clock, it's been 8 months and a handful of days since I moved to this town.  I realized rather quickly that there's really nothing here other than a dating scene populated by scam artists and ex-convicts OR my job.  Since I'm a prosecutor and not particularly gullible (anymore), I've decided to forgo the dating scene.  Which leaves my job.  Now I love my work, but I don't want to end up like our office urban legend.  The story goes that there was a woman in our courthouse that always had her office door closed, was single, antisocial, and worked ridiculously late hours.  Well, a couple days had passed and no one had seen her.  They opened her office door and found her dead.  It seems she suffered a heart attack, but no one had bothered to go in there.  Personally, the only thing I think would be worse is if I died in my house and was eaten by my pets (should I obtain any), but this story gave me the willies.  The only time I close my office door now is if there are witnesses inside with me.  Because being a workaholic is (obviously) not an option, I have decided to better myself through a number of activities.   Painting:  Currently there are several paint samples in my bathroom.  The house I'm renting was built in the 1930's and obviously people in the 1930's were skinny midgets, because my bathroom is absolutely miniscule.  You actually have to turn to the side to get in, which makes for entertainment when it’s 2 in the morning and I really have to pee.  However, it has a beautiful pedestal sink and a medicine cabinet I was forced to install because people in the 1930's also didn't believe in cabinet space.  The only problems now are my walls.  My landlord, a male, took it upon himself to paint my walls a muddy brown color.  Ever eat Mexican and take a shit?  That's about the color.  With some primer and a couple thousand coats, I'm aiming to turn that into a soft green and simultaneously add another notch to my talent tool belt.   Chess:  I started playing chess when I was 7 years old.  I bought a chess set from my teacher who brought back a bunch of stuff from Russia and set up her own little black market cottage industry in our classroom.  My father taught me to play.  For anyone who has not met my father, let me elaborate.  When I say that my father taught me to play, I mean that my father showed me how all the pieces moved.  He then proceeded to beat me at chess on a regular basis until I picked up the game.  No strategy, no assistance.  It got to the point that I dreaded chess like I dreaded a beating.  Around dinnertime I could always tell if it was going to be that kind of night . . . a chess night.  He would get this wild look in his eye, push his chair away from the table and say, "Get the chess set."  I would cry out, "No Daddy, no!" but he wouldn't listen, he wouldn't . . . I can't go on.  Needless to say, that the first time I won, when I was 11 (I'm a slow learner, okay?), I went the Bobby Fisher route and never played him again.  I played occasionally, with the same chess set in tow, but I never really played with anyone regularly.  That is, until I started hanging out in Albany.  I found a chess partner.  I beat him a couple of times, until he remembered how to play.  It was like playing with my Dad all over again after that.  But this time I refused to be cowered.  I now had a computer and money.  While my friend was in training for a month, I went to the bookstore, bought a book, and started playing online.  Since coming back into town, my friend and I are now 2-2.  I now have a regular partner on Wednesdays and finally understand that chess is more than your pieces running from the other pieces in terror.   Knitting:  What can I say?  I wanted to take up sketching, but the books were not instructive enough and knitting is cheaper.  After staring at 200 types of sketch pads and having the personnel at Michael's explain for the 100th time what kind of pencils I would need, I headed for the knitting section.  Ten dollars later I started learning to knit.  I don't know what the hell they're doing in the movies, but that's not knitting.  That contented clicking, both needles flying . . . that's not knitting, it's acting.  Knitting is painstakingly slow and filled with weird contraptions that go on the end of your needles and look like torture devices.  I am working on the quintessential beginner's project: a scarf.  I wanted a long, trendy, skinny scarf.  But I was so busy following the directions that I found myself knitting a fat, chunky, scarf that you used to wear in kindergarten and tried to lose in the coat closet.  But when it's done, I'm going to proudly wear it despite the fact that I live about 30 minutes from Florida and there is absolutely no possibility that it will ever get cold enough for a scarf to be sensible.  Unless you count my cold ass office.   Shooting:  I originally thought this was a bad idea.  I'm not a real fan of guns, which is a huge liability in a city filled with people who LOVE guns.  People, who buy property to hunt on, people who have deer strapped to their trucks in the fall.  As a prosecutor I have a badge and I'm allowed to have a concealed weapon.  How cool is that?  I almost had an orgasm when they gave me my badge and couldn't stop flashing it at innocent bystanders for weeks.  It was like every child’s cowboy dream come true . . . without the chaps.  But I wasn't sure I wanted the responsibility of a loaded weapon.  That is, until I went to the gun range.  I now understand why criminals have guns.  That feeling of power, of danger . . . it's better than dating a bad boy.  You are the bad boy.  After shooting the loaned Glock, I decided: I am a gun owner.  The only catch: I had to qualify in a shooting test and I could only qualify with the gun I planned on using.  I had no real plan of how I was going to do this without actually buying a gun.  I always sort of hoped I could just hold someone's gun for a little while.  More bad news: the gun trainer told me I wouldn't need a Glock.  Well, there go my gansta dreams!  He told me that for home protection, which I wanted it for, all I needed was a revolver (I don't need no stikin' revolver!).  So, my dream was deferred for a little while.  But recently, a friend of mine offered me a solution.  He's willing to sell me his 9mm and teach me how to shoot.  Now, although I had my heart set on a Glock (all the rappers have one!), I still knew what the hell a 9mm was.  We're going to the range soon and by summer's end I should be a pistol packin' mamma.  Mothers, hide your children.  It's my hope that these projects will, in the words of my high school guidance counselor, make me a "well-rounded person."  I believe that this city, despite its complete lack of cultural events, could actually be a move for the best.  Maybe, with a little work, it'll make me a better person.  Or at the very least make my aim better.

       This Old House   In an effort to advance as a person, I’ve taken on home ownership. Well, not really . . . it’s more like “Baby Home Ownership.” I’m renting a house. Essentially, all that means is that when something breaks, I don’t have to pay to fix it. I’m still responsible for all of the things that your average, first-time homeowner would be responsible for. And over the 6 months that I’ve been a proud faux-owner, I’ve run into several difficulties. Some of my problems have to do with me being on my own for the first time. Others are cost management issues. And some can be attributed to sheer laziness. Allow me to share.   Potty Time:   One night, while I was dividing my time between talking on the phone and waiting for my third load of laundry to finish, I noticed an odd noise, a sort of gurgling sound.  My first thought was that despite my bravado, or maybe because of it, my renting a house in a sketchy neighborhood had finally come back to bite me in the ass: someone had broken in.  In true scary movie fashion, I hung up the phone (thereby guaranteeing my forthcoming murder would have no witnesses) and moved into the hallway, while tentatively yelling the clichéd “Is anybody there?”  I moved into the bathroom and was met with an amazing sight.  I wish it was a simple matter of trying to flush too much toilet paper, or a misguided tampon, but unfortunately it was much worse.  With no assistance from myself, my toilet took it upon itself to begin filling up with a foul, brown liquid that I later learned was raw sewage.  I stood there in horror, helpless as my toilet began the slow-motion overflow onto my floor.  Almost simultaneously, in Amityville style, the sewage began bursting from my sinks and bathtub as well.  I couldn’t have been more surprised if it had been pea soup and a menacing voice whispered “Get Out.”  Now, being the pampered princess that I am, I have never faced this dilemma.  So, I began thinking what any rational, educated person would think: my house is haunted and it’s attacking me.  Luckily, my common sense kicked in and I realized that I should probably turn off my washing machine.  I passed the kitchen sink (also filling up with sewage), made it outside, and turned off the water before my house turned into a shit sea.  Ten minutes later I was frantically calling everyone I knew trying to figure out a solution.    In accordance with Murphy’s Law, this event occurred at around 10 p.m., when the only people available are very expensive plumbers who prey on your desperation and your Visa card.  I decided that a plumber could wait after my Aunt warned me that my 24-hour plumber could rape both my wallet and my person in one fell swoop unless I had a big, strong man at the house with me.  But the saddest part was when my Aunt informed me that although plumbers do a lot of things, they don’t clean raw sewage off your bathroom floor.  I don’t know why I expected those little mops with buckets from “Fantasia” to do it for me, but I did. Instead of Disney magic, I ended up making a trip to Wal-Mart in order to get two mops, extra-strength bleach and about 8 pair of rubber gloves; the kind of supplies you buy at 12 a.m. only when you have a body to dispose of.  Half an hour later, I was sweaty, funky, and covered in my pre-used toilet paper. In other words, I was a looker. I fled the house of horrors, spent the night over at a friend’s house (I hesitated to use the facilities at my house for fear of a relapse), and called my landlord at 6 the next morning.    Hot in Here:   Now I’ve always had a problem with the heat in my parent’s home, or the lack of it.  I’m always reminded of meat storage when I stay at my parent’s house in Pennsylvania.  And nothing says “Merry Christmas” like simulating North Pole conditions in your own home.  As I begged for a lump of coal or some lamp oil, my parents would disavow the need for heat as they huddled together on the couch like refugees; it wasn’t romantic, it was mutual fear of frostbite.  I concluded that two people with a king-sized electric blanket and mutual body heat could not understand the needs of the single and electric blanket-less.  I vowed that my own home would be a tropical paradise, 78 and sunny year-round.  A month later I was sipping Pina Coladas and singing, “this is my island in the sun.” The party stopped when I got my first electric bill. Now, I knew I was using gas heat, but I had always ignored all those silly people on the news whining about their gas bills.  I mean, how expensive could this shit be?  For the record, any bill higher than my loan payments causes me alarm. Needless to say that this scared the shit out of me.  And knowing that it’s due in 10 days made me apoplectic.  After confirming that the people at the Gas Company do not let you pay in installments, and waiting for my parents pass the phone back and forth between them so that they could take turns laughing at me, I made a decision. In an attempt to conserve energy and still be sophisticated, I undertook making my first fire in my fireplace.   The next morning, I awoke to the smell of barbecue. It took me a little while to realize that it wasn’t the Fourth of July and that my home was filled with thick, gray smoke. Interestingly enough my smoke alarm, which seems to be sensitive enough to warn me every morning that I’m toasting a bagel for breakfast, managed to miss this.  It took me over two hours to find the source of the smoke, put it out (for real this time), and air out my home. It seems that although my 1930’s chimney doesn’t have a flue, it does have something called an ash trap. The ash trap actually lived up to its moniker: it trapped the smoldering ashes underneath my house and turned my home into a very large smoker. My house became the Big Green Egg.  Now, while I’m all for near death experiences, I haven’t set another fire in my house since . . . unless you count the accidental ones. Instead, I found more modern (and safer) ways to conserve energy. Three days later I was sleeping under a blanket fortress and one month later my electric bill was something that resembled normal. All it took was turning off my heat in the daytime, wearing a full sweat suit when I got home, and a desire never to be warm again.    Animal House:   Somewhere around mid-March, I came home late only to be welcomed by a new fixture in my house. Perched on my crown molding was a medium-sized, jet-black creature that fluttered slightly when I turned on the light.  Now, house fires and exploding toilets I’m unfamiliar with.  But having parents that live in the middle of the woods makes you an expert on all kinds of animals.  I’d seen birds and knew that birds usually fly around hysterically until they run into your window and land stunned at your feet, only to start up the process all over again a few seconds later.  But this was new.  Again, like any intelligent female, I deduced that my visitor could only be a blood-sucking Transylvanian vampire bat that took at 3,000-mile detour and landed in my home.  I immediately ran toward my bedroom in the standard crouch-hands-covering-head position adopted by the wonderful actors and actresses in “Birds.” And to my very small credit, I at least had the peace of mind not to scream and to grab my phone on the way.    Thirty minutes later, I had called everyone I knew in Albany.  Every bad date, shady friend, and coworker got a phone call; if I had your number I was ringing you up.  No matter that some of these people I promised to call back 2 months ago, I didn’t even attempt niceties.  This was an emergency and there was no place for tact in an emergency.  I even called my parents for advice, only to be told by my father to “just go to sleep and forget about it.”  I guess he figured that sometime during the night, the bat would get tired of waiting for me and just walk out the front door.  After exhausting my options, I crept into the kitchen, grabbed my phone book and ran back into my bedroom with the number for emergency animal control.  The first service was an answering service, the second told me that it would cost $65 just to “assess the situation.”  Now, at this point, I’d gotten the fucking “situation assessed”, I just wanted to know how much it would cost to get rid of it.     After two hours of being locked in my room, the animal control guy called me to check up on the “situation.”   He finally took pity on me and gave me some free advice: Get a friend and two pairs of rubber gloves, knock the bat down with a broom, have the friend throw a towel on it, and throw the bat and towel out the door. Luckily, I still had some left over rubber gloves from the bathroom debacle, as well as a broom, and my extra-large "Jamaica" towel.  This left me only to have to find a victim willing to risk rabies in order to help me out. Again, my friend stepped in and offered assistance.  After letting him through the back door, my friend, armed with a baseball bat (poetic justice, I think), and I settled on a game plan.  I would swing the broom, he would throw the towel, and the phone would be pre-dialed to 91 just in case.  Five minutes later, we had a flapping, crazed bird on our hands that went out the open door. Come to find out that my “bat” was really just a chimney swallow. And while I will eventually find this situation funny, I’m still waiting to laugh. Since then I’ve had two mice, a pregnant pigeon on my porch, and another chimney swallow, all of them dead by ignominious, but effective, methods. But it's that first bird which will always hold a special place in my heart.   Needless to say, in these last six months I’ve become an expert in installing air filters and porch lights, had enlightening discussions on the best method for dispatching field mice, and witnessed my grass grow to frightening heights in an effort to secure a regular, and affordable landscaper (neighborhood kids don’t come cheap anymore). I’ve also found a home that I like, warts and all, and a more grown-up me. And I’ve found out the most important thing of all: I’ll be a wonderful condo owner someday.

       The List   While having a conversation with my best friend, we started talking about sex.  Even closer to home we began talking about how many sexual partners we’ve had.  This conversation was brought on by a recent development.    There was a very nasty rumor that made its way around the local circuit, spread courtesy of my ex-boyfriend.  Something about me begging to give him head.  Now, unless you’re living in a porn video, you already know there’s something very wrong with this rumor.  Very few women . . . screw it, I’m comfortable saying  NO  woman offers oral sex with absolutely no strings attached.  This is not “Baby Got Back: Vol. 10,” the absence of cheesy music should be the tip off.  But somehow, with a couple of words from a very sketchy source, I’ve become Janet Jackme.  But wait, it gets worse.  Supposedly I’m doing this as he’s valiantly crying,  “I’ve got a girlfriend!  For God’s sake, have some dignity!”     Don’t get me wrong.  About 4 years ago, I would have had sex with a man that had a girlfriend, especially if that man and I were in a past relationship.  Why?  Because I had almost no conscience, that’s why.  My younger, more shameless self somehow rationalized that it was the person in the relationship who should resist, not me.  I still believe that.  I also believe that no matter how bad the relationship is, I have no business in the middle of it.  Call it karma, but I believe that if I continued on the course I was on, I would one day find the man I was dating in bed with somebody named Carl.  Stuff like this has a way of biting you in the ass.  To my very small credit, I never messed with a man that was married.  Engaged, yes, but never married.  And I never approached a man with a girlfriend for sex.  Rather, the men involved were softball tossing their dick my way.  My crime is that I didn’t say no.  But much like the whispers that I was screwing my way through half of Morehouse’s campus when I was still a virgin, rumors such as these always seem to pop up when you’re on your best behavior.  Now, I’m no saint.  But even I am becoming slightly alarmed by the number of lovers I’ve been ripping my way through in the past few years. For a woman that lost her virginity at the ripe old age of 21,  boy , am I making up for lost time.  Don’t get the wrong idea.  I’m not Wilt Chamberlin; I’m by no means prolific.   I won’t disclose the exact number rather to say it’s more than 5, but less than 10.    Now, everyone has a different number and a different way to rationalize it.  Some believe that overseas sex doesn’t count.  Others believe that one-night stands just don't register.  Still others think that if you didn’t have an orgasm, that person shouldn’t exist, much less be counted.  My personal favorite though, is my best friend, whose number, including me, is somewhere in the 30’s.  He believes that you should look at the average rather than the total.  Example: If Guy A is 24 years old, started having sex when he was 16, and had 2 fulfilling relationships a year, he would have 16 sex partners.  On the other hand if Guy B is 24 years old, but started having sex when he was 22 and has an equal number of sex partners as Guy A, then he’s slept with about 8 women a year.  The difference? Guy A is good man, Guy B is a ho.  Don’t you wish math was this fun when you were a kid?  Unfortunately, even with this MCI math, my guy friend would still be considered a ho.  I’m of the brutally honest group.   I don’t care if his dick was only half way in.  I don’t care if it only lasted for 2 minutes.  I don’t care if you were drunk, he was drunk, and the videotape is the only reason why you remember it.  They all count.  My personal philosophy: just know who the hell you’ve slept with.  I don’t care if you have to get two forms of government id, make sure they have a passport before they get the pussy. To this end, I have kept a list.  Although it took some doing, and my best friend having to make a couple phone calls, I have first  AND  last names.  Except for one.    Now, in this day and age of AIDS, that’s nothing short of suicidal.  Luckily, a condom and several medical exams were involved.  And in my very weak defense, I knew his full name at the time.  The problem is that I had to be funny.  Those who know me know that I love giving nicknames, and not the cutesy kind, the mean-spirited kind that stick.  Well, his nickname was Porn Sex (I’ll explain it another time) and unfortunately, it stuck.  After quizzing my friends for 2 days, and searching the Omega Psi Phi directory (yes, there is an Omega Psi Phi directory and yes, I searched it) I realized that I was trapped by my own wit.  I can’t for the life of me remember this man’s name.  But I haven’t given up.  Should I get enough money together, the first thing I’m doing is getting a hypnotherapist to get that name out of my head and onto a piece of paper.    Ultimately, my conversation with my friend ended productively.  No, I’m not a ho.  Yes, I will get married without the priest asking about it.  No, my number of sex partners will not be my date’s first question.  But what I really learned is to release my death grip on my sexual partners.  I can’t change the past, only the future.  And to that end, I have embarked on my year-long voyage of celibacy.  I know the last time I had sex was  sometime in January or February (which should tell you how memorable it was).  So, starting from February 14th, I have decided to give up sex for 365 days.  Wish me luck . . .

        The Road Less Traveled    “You’re my daughter, and I love you, but one day your vindictiveness is going to destroy you.”&nbsp; Those were my mother’s words, 10 years ago.&nbsp; Luckily, much like the “I hope you have children that grow up to be just like you,” the prophecy has not been fulfilled, but not for lack of effort on my part.   My name is Curvy, and I’m a vindictive bitch.&nbsp; More like a recovering vindictive bitch, but I won’t quibble.&nbsp; I'm proud to say it's been at least three years since I've actively plotted against someone.&nbsp; But the truth is, much like alcoholism, being a vindictive bitch is not something that you ever stop being.&nbsp; You just have to&nbsp;take the high road one day at a time, and hope that you don’t find yourself passed out on the side of the low road one day; I pray&nbsp;daily that I&nbsp;won't fall off the wagon.&nbsp;    And let me tell you, events of the past few months have made that very difficult indeed.&nbsp; To start a short list, I have: 1) seen my boss defend his job despite being disparaged in his election campaign; 2) seen my favorite mentor (in four years he may be my favorite boss) stand helpless as his character was viciously attacked in the same election; 3) stood mute as  my  character was attacked by a past lover; and 4) held my tongue when this same lover and his “friends” saddled me with three cats. *      * Let’s just go ahead and address this now.&nbsp; I am a 27 year old, single female with three cats. (moment of silence)&nbsp; As my friend joked, I skipped the spinster starter kit and went to full-blown spinster.&nbsp; But through perseverance, the help of some true friends, and about $100 to cover vaccinations, I should be down to a one-kitten house by next week.    I was recently told by a person that I would do “anything to appear to be the ‘bigger person’.” &nbsp;Despite the fact that I’m often the bigger person in most of my relationships (usually by a good twenty or thirty pounds), he’s dead wrong.&nbsp; It takes almost everything   not   to be the smaller person.&nbsp; It’s easy to be petty.&nbsp;   Let’s face it; people who take the high road are stupid.&nbsp; One of my&nbsp;favorite quotes&nbsp;comes from the movie “Spaceballs” and puts&nbsp;my theory&nbsp;into perspective:    "Evil will always triumph because good is dumb."   Look at all those fairy tales we grew up with as children:&nbsp;Cinderella, Snow White -&nbsp;they are all&nbsp;about some insipid, dumb ass female who lets people treat her like dirt for about 15 or 20 years, until someone feels sorry enough to help her out so she can have a happy 4 or 5 years before she succumbs&nbsp;in childbirth, or dies of typhoid or the Black Plague. *    &nbsp;    * Yeah, I know it’s not in the fairy tale, but let’s be real: these were set in the Medieval times when anything could kill you and life expectancy was somewhere in the 30’s. &nbsp;

       “You, Me, and She”    1999:  Newly returned from Ireland, I get a phone call from the boyfriend I transformed into an ex shortly before I left.  He wants to be friends and more importantly, he wants to pay for dinner.  We meet at one of our old spots and begin to negotiate a friendship with the same kind of diplomacy and civility as the Israel-Palestine peace accords.  As the evening deteriorates we get on MARTA and head back to the dorms.  As we’re walking back, he decides in a fit of honesty to tell me  THE TRUTH.   Now, as all of you know  THE TRUTH  is the last thing anyone wants to hear from an ex-boyfriend.  Why?  Because it usually involves some sordid, disturbing confession that’s only going to increase the amount of self-doubt about your past relationship while also increasing your therapy bills.  So, it was in this fashion that he admitted that he cheated on me while we were together the summer before.  Now, there are people that say that “cheating is cheating.” Those are the same people who say that “war is war”.  Not so.  There’s minor skirmish and then there’s Hiroshima.  And like war, there are levels of cheating, ranging from minor, to massive.  Example: While my ex and I were dating, I kissed another guy.  That’s cheating, true.  However, I fessed up to it immediately (mainly because my guilt was so obvious that I broke down sobbing when he said “hey”), and he forgave me.  But what he admitted went way beyond kissing, went beyond a one-night stand.  He had a sexual relationship with this girl for about a month.  And to add to the drama, it was someone I knew.  Not well, mind you, but I knew her.  The only way it could have been worse is if he had introduced her to me while we were dating as “my replacement.”  In his need for honesty he gave up names, dates, even an address and current phone number for verification purposes.  Now since I wasn’t putting out during college, I of course went into a complete meltdown and believed that if I had only parted my thighs I could have averted this disaster.  Of course, now I realize that sex just leads to bigger and more interesting disasters.  I was torn between triumph ("I  knew  you kissed differently when I got back that summer!") and devastation (" She  taught you how to do that to me?!"). Needless to say, our friendship never quite off the ground.    Fast forward to 2004.  My ex and I are relatively close, taking only the dumping of his former girlfriend/my-arch-enemy and my move out of Fulton County to facilitate our friendship.  As were reminiscing over our time together, I casually mention the cheating incident.  Somehow, what I took so seriously four years ago is hilarious now; sort of like re-watching "New Jack City".  Miraculously, he disavows knowledge of the incident.  “You know, that girl, Sasha . . . Tasha, whatever her name was.”  Like an idiot, I begin rambling on about the phone call, the friendship accord, Houlihans . . . still nothing.  He simply denies having any idea what I’m referring to.  But I can hear the smile in his voice.  Most guys deny cheating on you  while  they’re doing it, but not mine; he denies it five years after he owned up to it.  The reason? Well, my ex and I are quite competitive, which is to say that we used to go to Dave and Busters for “fun” and wouldn’t leave until someone started crying.   Add to that the fact that he is fully aware of a little known Curvy family motto:  "Prove It."   It's this motto that led me into the practice of law.  I figured if I could convince family members beyond a reasonable doubt that our dog died of natural causes and not because of anything I did while they were away, I could argue anything.  Unfortunately, this now meant that the burden was on me to prove that not only did this Sasha/Tasha person actually exist, but that she was the shameless hussy that slept with my ex-boyfriend while we were still together.  I became obsessed.  I tried to think of people that actually remembered her.  I searched my memory banks for obscure things that I knew about her, which would allow me to narrow my search.  I looked through Classmates.com and at one point tried finding the number of one of my old lovers that I hadn’t talked to in three years in order to question him on her identity.  I even stooped so low as to go through my best friend’s yearbooks (mine were in storage) in an effort to find Sasha/Tasha.  More infuriating was that my best friend also vaguely remembered a Sasha/Tasha, but couldn’t recall her real first name or anything else other than that she was a student at our school.  Sherlock Holmes, she ain’t.  An hour later I realized four things: 1) Yearbook pictures aren’t mandatory in college, 2) I managed to get through three years without taking a picture, 3) My hair in my Senior class picture should have been seriously rethought (or as my best friend put it: “Your hair probably looked good two days later when those curls dropped” – I looked like a deranged, high yellow, Shirley Temple), and 4) Sasha/Tasha managed to go through four years of higher education without taking a single yearbook photo.  It was then that I realized that even the best investigators couldn’t find this information. I know, I asked them.  I also discovered that even if she did have a criminal record in Georgia, I wasn’t going to find her without a first name.  My investigators wouldn’t even  try  to do a Sasha/Tasha search!  To that end I admitted defeat last night.  I begged him to do me the small favor of disclosing a full name on my birthday.  I told him that it truly would be the best present he could give an anal retentive-obsessive compulsive girl like me.  But I know that the name doesn't matter.  Don't get me wrong, I still  really  want to know her name, preferably with him admitting it on tape for future reference.  But, it's not as important to me as it was five years ago.  Five years ago I vowed that I would never forget the names of those that hurt me.  Five years ago I also vowed in classic soap opera fashion that I would somehow (cue dramatic, cheesy music)  MAKE HIM PAY.   Instead, five years later, we're up at 1:00 a.m., gossiping like teenage girls, while his friend (that couldn't stand me, or I, him) yells out "Hi."  And five years later, he's asked me to do the unheard of: to memorialize my stalker-rific search for the truth in my blog.  Here it is sweetie, hope you enjoy it.

       Letting Go   	You wouldn’t think with the life I’ve had that I would have a problem letting go of people.  My life up until the last 8 years had been a series of moves: new places, faces, and experiences to keep me occupied.  I find however, that when it comes to those in my life, I have a distinct problem with letting them go quietly into that good night.  I believe it’s because I’ve come to crave permanency, some sense of stability to give roots to an otherwise unstable and unpredictable life.  I remember at 18 years of age, crying about college when others should have been happy, simply because I was too damn tired to pack up yet again, and leave behind those I had come to love and rely upon.    	I have somehow found myself in an odd sort of limbo: fearful of losing those that I care about to a tomorrow that’s never promised and therefore fearful of growing close, and at the same time clinging to those that I’ve come to depend upon, no matter how much it may be time to move on.  Recent events have brought this problem to new light.  The first is my current employment.  When my boss hired me, he neglected to inform me that he was running for re-election this year.  To his credit, he ran unopposed four years ago and expected to coast by this year in the same fashion.  Let me explain: like the President, a District Attorney (DA) has to run every four years for his job.  Now, not many people have bosses that are re-elected every four years, but I guess I’m just one of the lucky ones.  And like the President, a new District Attorney is not at all obligated to keep any of the old staff.  Normally, your job is based on your performance.  My job however, is based on the whims of the newly elected.  And the election is less than two weeks away.  To add to the drama, the Judge that I have practiced solely in front of is being challenged as well.  The other two judges?  Their jobs are secure (running unopposed).  But the person challenging my Judge has a score to settle: he trounced her in the last election and she wants a rematch.  To truly honor these events we have a new urban legend currently circulating around our office (for the first one see “Things to Do in Albany . . . “): there was a DA’s office somewhere in south Georgia that had the same DA for almost 12 years.  But when the DA was defeated, the new DA held a staff meeting and fired all of the Assistant DA’s.  Variations abound, including one where the new DA calls in all the Assistants one at a time and tells them if they need to find new jobs or not.  Never being one to waver, I have fully thrown my support behind my boss, which means that if he loses, I could very well find myself out on my ass in January.  Luckily, I will have almost 6 months to look for a new job should he lose.  I have also thrown my support behind my Judge, which means if he loses, the new Judge will do her best to make my life a living hell.  I must admit the prospect of having to leave Albany scares me.  It’s not that I love it here: I bitch and complain about the lack of activities, and my friends miss me in Atlanta.  Maybe Greg, the Chief ADA (who’s  definitely  fired if the challenger wins – he’s the metaphorical Vice President), put it best when he said “everyone wants to leave on their own terms.”  I know that I’m eventually going to go, but I want to leave when I’m ready, not because some heinous power monger forced me out.  For the first time in almost a year, I’m scared: not scared that I’m going to be trapped down here, but scared that I won’t be trapped down here.  I realize that despite the fits and starts, I have a house I like, friends I care about, and a job I love.  I have a life here, and it hurts to think it could be taken away so soon.  Somehow things have grown familiar on me when I wasn’t looking.  They say familiarity breeds contempt, but in me its grown a sense of contentment, of completion.  And I don’t want to lose the faces in my office to new faces, or pack up yet again for greener pastures.    The second is the departure of my ex-boyfriend.  At first I was mightily relieved that he was removing himself from the vicinity.  Especially in light of rumors that had all but eviscerated my social life (see “The List”).  I was already looking forward to being able to visit my old haunts without feeling haunted by his presence.  I even endeavored to avoid bidding adieu, feeling that the event was wholly unnecessary considering everything that had preceded it.  However, a returned object and a note on my blog changed my mind.  I believed that the least I could do is say farewell to an individual that made the first months of my life here bearable and the last months a strive for independence and an exercise in strength.  I visited, with pretext in hand, ready to say my goodbyes and wish him well on his new life.  But as I spoke with him it dawned on me that his perfect life: the job, the new love, the escape from a town he had long outgrown, had very real, human flaws.  I believed him invincible, cocky, and formidable when I first met him.  The man I now spoke to was defeated, humble, and unsure of himself.  He was Samson, blinded and shorn.  And somehow, in that moment as I looked at him, he was all the more beautiful and real to me. It wasn’t until later that evening that I began to cry.  I would like to blame my maudlin mood on the martinis I had consumed earlier with friends, but I know that the bittersweet ache I felt wasn’t alcohol induced.  Although we hadn’t spoken in months, I realized that I would sorely miss this individual that had largely contributed to the last eight months of my life.  Like that last day of high school, I realized that the things that you had grown to dread, the moments that hurt you, are sometimes the things that you miss the most.  Maybe it’s because those things give us strength and define us just as much as the triumphs.  Or maybe people are just suckers for pain.  So now, in a moment of clarity, I will say this: I did love him once.  And when he left, I realized that there was nothing I could do to stop the people I had loved from leaving.  Breaking off from him, for whatever reason, didn’t kill the pain, it just masked it for a little while until I saw him again.  And that’s not such a bad thing.  I’ve learned that letting go of a person doesn’t mean you stop caring about them.  I guess that will come later.

       Week in Review   With so much going on right now, and so much about to happen, there's honestly too much joy, laughter, and learning to bottle up into a rather trite story and post it on the blog.  That's for later.  In the meantime, I hope the following will give you a hint of what's happening.  It's by a man named Rob Brezsny who writes some of the most lyrical, introspective, inspiring, and puzzling horoscopes I've ever read.  As an added bonus it will hopefully provide food for thought for all you Cancers out there:   I propose that you conduct a radical experiment for the next three weeks. Between now and July 22, try on the theory that life is on your side. Assume that all of creation is conspiring to give you exactly what you need, exactly when you need it. At least once every day, speak these words with passionate sincerity: "I believe that reality is a sublime comedy staged for my education and amusement, and that there is a benevolent conspiracy to liberate me from my ignorance and help transform me into the unique masterpiece I was born to be."

       Death Becomes Her   It never ceases to amaze me how death can creep into the mundane.  You would think that after having my peace shattered by death so many times I would come to expect it. Or, that I would be tensely coiled, waiting for death to bump into me as I rounded the corner.  But I wasn't.  I guess I’ve become complacent. Death hasn't affected me in such a long time that I forgot what a constant it was in my life for the last 27 years. I forgot how easily it could renew my acquaintance. I forgot how it can appear, like a former lover, when you are at your most sloppy comfortable and completely shake your confidence and rattle your nerve.  My boss, Ken, and his Chief Assistant, Greg, were in a car accident yesterday. The news placed it in the driest terms possible:    Early Tuesday afternoon, the SUV Hodges was driving hydroplaned into oncoming traffic near Cordele. It rolled several times, and five other cars and a tractor-trailer were involved in the wreck. Hodges and Edwards were both ejected.   What this report didn't explain was how devastated our office was. An hour and a half away, we were spoon-fed information as to their condition, which fluctuated between dire to cautiously optimistic. It didn't explain why I cried for so long when I finally made my way home. How I sat in my bathroom and sobbed out a prayer for them, for these kind men and their families; a prayer for a son not to lose his father, for a wife not to lose her husband, for a mother not to lose her son, for a fiancée not to lose her groom.  Nor did it explain how much of a family these two men had become to me, a person without family of friends in Albany: a girl that was very far away from home. Each one of them showed me immeasurable kindness, kindness that went beyond a boss or a co-worker. Ken and his fiancée rented me her place and later fire sold all of her furniture to me when I found a place of my own. Ken even brought me a housewarming gift. Greg has been like a father to me here. When my transmission died he lent me his car for a month so that I wouldn't have to rent one. He and I have worked side by side on cases and in that time he has given me his support, his trust, and his encouragement. These are not people that needed to die yet, but I’m sure that’s what everyone says about the people they love and then lose.  I wasn't ready to lose these people to death just yet.   We   weren’t ready to lose these people.  And fortunately, we're not going to. They're doing well considering they went 10 rounds with a semi. And although neither one of them will be winning beauty pageants anytime soon (Ken is missing some teeth, Greg had surgery on his eye, and both have pretty severe facial lacerations), they are in good health and may be back in Albany by Thursday. But this moment in time has shaken me. It's death's way of reminding us how easily it can reacquaint himself with us . . . how easily it can open the door and walk back in.  I won’t forget so soon again.

       Question   I've got a question for certain people in my viewing audience. A little birdie (well, hell, it was Rainmayun) often related to me comments made by those reading my posts (minus your names, of course). Well, in response, I did two things.  1. I exed the sex (needless to say my posts are about as salacious as the TBS version of "Sex in the City") 2. I enabled my comments (I figured that way you could critique my posts directly, rather than through my cuddly conduit)  So, with that said, I have two questions:  1. Do you miss the sex talk? Should I go back to the raunchy Curvy or stay the demure miss I've become? 2. Why no comments? Is it that you don't feel comfortable or that my posts have just become that boring sans sex?  Okay, well that was 4 questions, but I would appreciate a response from the great beyond. Yes, you can respond anonymously. Just think of this as a survey so that I can make this page a better read.  I look forward to hearing from you all for a change.

       Fractured      I posted this about a two years ago; I'm posting it now because I believe that somewhere out there, someone needs to read this. God spoke to me, the Spirit moved me, whatever the heck you want to call it. I just felt that it was necessary.      I’m crying a lot more and I’m not sure if that’s a bad thing. You see, I’ve always seen crying as a sign of weakness and thereby avoided it like the plague. In fact, the folklore surrounding me, supplied by my exes, is that I can’t cry. But I think I’m getting soft in my old age. I find myself crying more openly in front of others when before I prided myself on never crying in front anyone. And my recent conversation with a friend gave me some insight into the cause of this new, softer Curvy.  The topic: Depression. Yep, I’m not afraid to admit it: I suffered from depression. I consider myself lucky because it wasn’t a permanent condition. Rather, it was brought on by a series of traumatic events that I refused to deal with. Namely, the death of my Uncle from AIDS, followed immediately by a career setback, topped off with the death of my grandmother on the first day of my second year of law school. All within six months.  Now in the Black community that I exist in, depression is a White problem. God forbid should a Black person go to a psychiatrist, or have to take medication. My entire life I’ve been told that if you are sad or upset, you should just “suck it up” or “get over it”; that I should “count my blessings” and move forward. But I learned that there is only so much you can “suck up”, there are only so many times you can “count your blessings” and there is only so much you can “get over.” An unfortunate side effect of this revelation is the knowledge there is a part of me that will always be ashamed that my pain became too much for me. My superwoman cape fell off and was replaced with a green bathrobe that I lived in for almost two months (don’t be alarmed, I kept it washed and pressed). I do consider myself blessed, however, because I have family who cared enough to worry when I didn’t call and who eventually tracked me down like “The Fugitive.”  So I took a semester off of school (not like I was going anyway), went on anti-depressants for a year (Paxil: it’s not just for social anxiety anymore), got psychological help, and dealt with the grief that was taking over my life.  The person I spoke to had also gone through a period of depression. And he asked me whether or not I sometimes felt myself sliding back into depression. I answered no, but after talking to him about it for a while, I did have to admit that I’ve seen changes in myself since then. The only way I can describe it is to compare it to a broken bone. Once you break your arm, you can get it set and it will eventually heal. But that bone will never be 100% again. It will always be slightly weaker. It will always be somewhat fractured. And that is where I am now. Because of what I went through I’m just a little weaker, just a little more exposed, a little more vulnerable. My soul knows its breaking point. And although I’m a little sadder for this, I’m also much wiser. And just a little softer around the edges.  Why the story? Well, with September 11th coming up, I realized that there are a lot of people out there like myself: fractured. And although this past year has allowed for a lot of healing, our country and the people in it will never fully recover. Our weaknesses have been exposed and we have become vulnerable. But this has also made us a little softer around the edges, and a little more caring for it.
