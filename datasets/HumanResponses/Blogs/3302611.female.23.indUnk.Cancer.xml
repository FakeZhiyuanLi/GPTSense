      On the bus home, top deck, swaying slightly at half eleven. Not quite the night bus, not late enough, but full of glazed faces and bleared eyes. Double seat to myself, fine. Staring out the window at the tops of heads as they jostled on at the stops. Not too bolshy, not too many people heading out north. Enough seats for everyone, the padding flattened by the daily crush of hundreds of buttocks. Stiff from the sweat seeping from millions of glands, through the cheap suit trousers and into the rough fuzzy chairs. You can get cushions in the print from the London Transport Museum, brown and orange and vomit yellow. Advertised on the posters in the lift at Covent Garden. Actually, I think the seats were blue last night. Have they changed recently? Maybe it's the tube after all, dazzling commuters with its retro checkered charm.  Slumped against the window, looking out. And the sounds filter through. There's a man behind me chewing gum and I can hear the slurping, sticky chump, the elastic snap. Chew, chew, chew, monotonous. Jaws working ceaselessly, the squelch of saliva in the cheeks. I glare at his reflection, pasty against the dark and the sickly orange streetlamps. My teeth clench in sympathy, the cattle-urge to cud. Hell, we never evolved from the bovine herd. Stop. The girl in front, who I thought was a man with a long straggling ponytail, has her phone out now, prodding it with tapered fingers. And it beeps. It talks back, complaining, a modulated whine. Be-beep. Drrring! Game over, lost again. On and on and on, from the British Library and on past King's Cross, through the backroads and up Caledonian road. Beep. Tap. Failure. Ker-ching! Da-dah! Level complete. But the next stage is harder and the shrill more frequent. I shift in my seat, restless, eyes squinted up, rubbing my face and literally twiddling my thumbs. There's a girl sitting next to me now, she got on at King's Cross and I peer at her sidelong, wondering if the noise has penetrated her consciousness. The tightening of the eyes and the clench of the jaw. Signifiers of disapproval. We all twitch together. Slurp snap beep chew beep snap chomp Beep Beep squelch BEEP. Head moving from side to side, neck taut, quivering with tension. Breathing faster and purposefully slow, calming. Calm.  When she gets off she turns round and she's really quite pretty. She says thanks to the man who shuffles over so she can get past and beams at us. We quirk our lips in response. Thanks.

      Degenerate. How can you start an evening talking about hedge funds and equity release and investments and bonds and end up talking about vengeful women and blood sex? To be fair, we did start the night by attempting to get the features editor to sing the Hungarian national anthem. Well, he did promise. But he made a stab at 'Isten' (what does it mean? He didn't know) in quite an attractive baritone before caving in. Didn't know the tune. Couldn't read the words. Excuses? They come so easily, falling from our lips like pearls (I hesitate to add 'before swine'). And maybe the triple vodkas my workmates were putting away, and the mysterious bottle of wine that was left all to me, iced down in the bucket, helped lubricate the filthier sides of the brain, firing smut down our synapses. Alcohol, journalists and PRs, the unholy trinity. More beer! More wine! More vodka! More cigarettes! All to excess on the company card. Expenses funding a lifestyle I can't afford to mimic. This job's giving me dangerously expensive tastes and  I'll be paying the tax on my liver for years. But it's all good fun, all entertainment. All shallow shallow appearances and networking and mwah mwah and here's my card. What's not to love?

      It was lying on the kerb, blended into the speckled grey of the granite stone. Perhaps if it had been on a creamy concrete paving flag it would have been clearer, accentuated. As it was people went past, unseeing, even with their eyes fixed on the ground at their feet. Broken. I almost trod on it, striding blindly to work, red leather bag clutched tightle in one hand. I could pretend that my glasses had fogged but I was wearing contacts, my fringe is sometimes too long but I'd cut it a few nights ago and it bounced high on my forehead. But I saw the bundle out of the corner of my eye at the last minute, quiet and huddled, and I swerved away, out from the railings I was tracing with my fingers. I stumbled, took a giant pace, but carried on walking, the image flashed onto my retina, live in my mind.  It was just a pigeon, lying peaceful next to the road. It could have been sleeping but its feathers were dulled, its body sodden. Its small head drooped onto its chest, hobbled claws curled under, out of sight. If I'd have trodden on it, the bones would have snapped under my feet. As it was it rested, wings furled across its back, haloed by petrol fumes and flanked by the metal stream of traffic.

      The garden was lush, yesterday. Verdant. Sprawling swaying grasses and gem-green shining leaves. You could run your hands through them like hair. Tall blue flowers like thistles without thorns, skinny petals fuzzing their crowns. Thickets of sticky, stinging leaves tangled with delicate lilac blossom. Fat yellow dandelions and their clocks that never told accurate time. A cacophony of weeds and wildlife and cat shit hidden in the jungle lawn. Seeping, cloying, oppressive life.  We attacked it with inadequate tools, hacking at the grass with kitchen scissors, chopping out limp hanks that we threw in a pile on the sad concrete patio. The landlord had given us a flymo but we knew the fauna would snare the blades, snag the whirring wheels and choke the temperamental machinery. So we did it by hand, and with basic tools. A hoe and a lawn edger, according to a housemate. We pulled the proud dandelions out by the roots and they came easily, hollow stalks snapping with a satisfying hollow chonk. Handfuls and armfuls of vanquished weeds, clogged with dull earth, bleeding sap. It covered our clothes and our arms and our faces when we wiped away sweat. The plants pricked us and stung us, fighting back, so our arms rose in red bumps and scratches dewed our fingertips.  In the chaos I picked snails from the flowerbeds, one by one. Their whorled shells were dull, a camouflage green-grey, banded with brown, their plump grey bodies trailing silver. I must have had fifteen in my hands and they fizzed and bubbled and retracted as I moved. I put them over the wall, into the wilderness of our neighbour's garden, a rambling mass choked by brambles. Nature run riot. There'd have been no fighting that, with our value manual tools and our washing-up gloves. We did a good job, I think, although the flymo defeated us and sits sadly next to the fridge. We lost a vital bolt and the whole contraption veered and shook. No-one would risk plugging it in, in case it ran out of control and sliced off our toes and gouged our shins. But the garden looks bare, diminished. Quiescent. I'm going to plant poppies, tomorrow.

      They lie side by side, sheets pulled up tight to their chins. Twin butterbeans, their skin papery and wrinkled. In the failing light of the previous afternoon, she had listened as her husband’s breathing rasped and clicked and eventually, painfully, stopped. She had knocked the receiver to the floor in her haste to dial for help, fingers fumbling on the old-style twist dial. Again and again she’d wound in the numbers until it had sunk in that the receiver was dead, the dim burr of the tone curtailed. And then she remembered that she hadn’t had a call for, what? Days? Weeks? The phone sat ugly and useless, plastic gleaming balefully in the gloom. If she’d had any strength left she’d have gone to the window and cried for help, although she knew she was too weak to lift the heavy sash. Maybe someone would have seen her, pale against the dark, mouthing guppy-like and frantic. A madwoman, they’d have thought.  How long was it since she’d ventured out of the room? Out of bed, even? Her hands fluttered at her neck, brushed nervously at the covers. Once neatly tucked and folded they hung loose and heavy over their bodies. She’d ridden the polyester wave, sparks and all, and had been grateful to sink back into the cool clutches of cotton. She remembered going down to the kitchen to heat some soup and she’d tripped on the step carrying the bowls back up. She’d fallen and she couldn’t get up, and the glutinous liquid and spattered and scalding. Her husband had been calling to her but he’d been fading then, and she’d lain on the spongy carpet in the hall listening to his complaining and growing fright. It had been all right in the end – she’d hauled herself to her feet, gripping the banister tight and tottered up the stairs. She’d intended to go and clear up later but somehow she’d never managed. A bruise had flowered on her hip where she’d hit the floor and spread like a wine stain down towards her knee. It was still a virulent blue-back and it ached to move. Even when she lay still and quiet she could feel the tenderness. That must have been the last time she’d gone down. The stairs frightened her: her son had promised he’d install a stairmaster to carry her up and down, up and down in relative ease, but it had never appeared. Now she couldn’t imagine scaling them, the idea was absurd. Her fingers were crooked and swollen with arthritis and the rail was varnished smooth. She saw herself falling, light as a feather, floating gape-mouthed down the narrow stairwell, tossed and turned by the current of her passage. And the crash and crush at the bottom, bones as frail as a bird’s shattering, snapping like kindling. No, for the moment she would stay here, calm and cold and alone.  ***  She was still waiting for him to come back, the son. He'd come round with the fat lump - what was her name? Janet? Sue-anne? Her memory was fading. A Christian name. One of those virtues, she thought. Hope, Faith, Charity. She couldn't remember, so she stayed the lump in her mind. Florida, he'd said. We're going for a holiday, mum. A couple of weeks. While we're out there, we'll have a look at places for you and Pa. You'll like it out there. Hot. Lots of sun. Alligators. And he'd grinned and did a waggling jaw thing with his arms that had made them all laugh. The lump had relatives out there, some from England, some native. They all loved it too. She hadn't been too keen, she thought, as she'd hugged her son goodbye and the lump had dutifully pecked at her cheeks, missing by inches. She was glad of that, actually. The thought of her glistening, pouting lips pressed against her dry old skin made her quaver. Be back soon, she'd murmured. She'd known her husband had been ill but hadn't wanted to spoil things. Her son and his wife, they were so buoyant. She couldn't remember seeing them so happy, fizzing over with excitement, their future writ large in front of them. And they were doing it for them, weren't they? Sacrificing their holiday to go hunting for retirement homes. So dull. Her husband had gripped him by the elbow. Have a great trip, son, he'd said gruffly. He'd looked him right in the eye then, and their son had smiled slickly and patted his father's hand. He'd bounced out the door, the lump mincing behind him. As she'd peered through the distorted glass after them she'd caught glimpses of them loading luggage into the taxi in the son.  There had been a few phonecalls at first, enthusiasm ringing in the voices, brochures sent back detailing the luxe accommodation they could expect. For weeks her dreams had been full of villas and swimming pools and she talked to her husband of golf and the beneficial effects of the humid climate as he wheezed in his old chair, and later in bed. They'd trickled out though, less and less frequent, her son's smooth tones echoing as if from a great distance. He was holding himself back she thought, and castigated herself for being a silly old woman. But in the end they had petered out completely, and a while after that the phone had gone dead. She'd never paid a thought to the finances, to be honest. Her husband had done all that and, when he couldn't manage anymore, with the shiny new accounts and top deals and unlimited credit, the son had taken over. By that time they were both too weak and too proud to ask for help. He'll come back, they told eachother over and over, until she lapsed into silence and he lost heart. She'd counted herself lucky that they kept the cupboards well stocked with cans of soup and beans and various vegetables and tins of sardines. The fresh food had gone, of course, eaten or thrown away once it started to grow thick with mould. The lady who came to do the shopping hadn't turned up and she hadn't had her number and anyway, now the phone was obsolete.  *** A slash of cool sunlight cuts through the dusty curtains, throwing the dusky pink tea-rose wallpaper into sharp relief. She is still lying there, pressed against the bulk of his cadaver. An electric fire heats the room and intensifies the cloying, sickly smell that she imagines to be decay. She tried to get up the other day. All her pride had drained away and she thought for a moment she could make it out into the street and seek help from her neighbours, from people walking past, from strangers. As she swung her legs stiffly round and hauled her failing body upright she was overwhelmed by a sudden nausea and a wordless horror. Slowly she lay back and closed her eyes, red veins against the frail blackness. Now she lies still, silent. Her eyes are wide and she stares blankly at the ceiling, blind to the damp patches and the spider building its web in the corner over the curtain-rail. From outside floats the faint sound of children playing and laughing and the insistent thud of a ball. Her feet are cold and she rubs them together, repetitive friction and fidget, but the chill remains. She huddles closer, closing in on herself and sinking into the embrace of her husband.

      It was, at the end of the day (what a hideous phrase), an excellent outfit. Bright pink t-shirt with Betty Boop print, red pursed lips all kissable and her slinky eye winking coyly. A coy wink? She manages it. Oh Betty, as they say. Or whoa. Flared 50s style skirt, vaguley naval with it's blue and white vertical striping. And pleats. Tight at the waist with four little blue buttons, detailing above the zip. Hovering on the knee, kicking out with every step. And bright pink shoes. Fuchsia, the same as the top. Stilletoes, with detatchable leather bows and pointy pointy toes. I always call them my pig trotter shoes, affectionately. Does all this sound rather naff? I tell you what, it looked fucking hot. Accesorised with a sweetie necklace in pastel sugar and sweeping black liquid liner and a peek-out poker-straight fringe.  I lost one of my bows, predictably. I'd put them in my bag because they were rubbing my ankles as I walked in a vaguely seductive, mostly painful way. Snapped them off and stuffed them away, cradled with my purse and my phone and my cigarettes. It must have fallen out when I swung onto the bus flashing my oyster card, or maybe at the first bar where I bought wine and vodka and asked the DJ what record he was playing because I'd had it in my head before and no-one knew. Get down tonight (not the one everyone's heard). Shimmery happy music, but not the scene we were headed for. We sat outside under the heaters and gossiped, passing the time, looking at dressed up pretty boys. It was when I went to clip the bows back on, at the cleft of my toes, that I discovered the loss. But then mismatched feet looked kind of cool, not too prissy perfect.  I danced later, unbalanced, Tiger in one hand cigarette wavering in the other. A friend arrived drunk and we stayed late, talking to men on the dancefloor, swapping numbers, not intending to call. I walked home barefoot along the Holloway Road, shoes dangling from the hooks of my fingers.

      Flipflops and summer rain do not go. Yesterday I was dressed for sun: neat skirt, specially fitted black skirt with breast shapes cut in to flatter the curves and not gape unattractively or tent up round the belly, black and white flipflops. I've had them for years now and they come out every summer for urban wear. On the beaches I wear bright pink, silk-flowered, plastic versions. But not in the city. The day gloomed and by the afternoon the clouds had piled up, dripping on tourists passing by below us in the Strand. A group of them had emergency umbrellas, bought on the spur of the moment from one of the shockingly expensive shops that suck in the unwary and spit them out, loaded with bags of tat. They unfurled them and disappeared under mushrooms emblazoned with Union Jacks and we rushed to the windows and watched them until a doubledecker blocked them from sight.  I went for drinks after work, in the vague hope the clouds would clear. Goosebumps pricked up on my arms beneath the three-quarter length sleeves and I crossed my arms across my chest to trap in the heat. Cocktails leant a false warmth but heading back to the tube I slithered along slippery cobbles and kept my head down to stop the rain catching on my eyelashes, smearing my mascara. I dithered at the tube exit at Holloway Road, peering out into the soggy grey. But I went, kicking up water, slipping into puddles that disguised themselves in the uneven pavement. Muddy water kicked up my legs and the skin between my toes whitened and wrinkled. My shirt clung to my back and my chest, drenched. The people I passed wore jeans and hooded jackets and carried sturdy black umbrellas and looked at me sidelong as they passed. I watched the floor, sending up splashes with every step.

      The man had a stick, although he didn't look old. He had shaggy grey hair straggling to his shoulders and the hint of a bald patch at the crown. He limped slightly and was dressed in jeans and a shirt and waistcoat. In green. Camoflague. The stick tapped on the concrete but he didn't lean on it. Was he smoking? Probably. Roll-ups. And a beast strolled at his side. A dog, a Great Dane or some other over-sized hound, long back on a level with the man's waist. If it had leapt up its paws would have rested on shoulders and it would have been able to stare down into the man's eyes, pink tongue lolling dripping strings of dog spit onto his forehead. Its head hung down between its legs as it ambled, limbs dislocated as they moved in slo-mo. Great pads thudding and clacking on the pavement. Swaying from side to side as the weight of its body shifted and its shoulders rolled, tail heavy and limp, and insufficient rudder. And it was white. All white. Albino. Red eyes burning out of dumb, Disneyesque face.   Where did they come from, then? Shuttered up in a cave away from the light growing pallid and sun-starved and sick. Watching Plato's shadows from behind the fire until they were old and grizzled and overcome with blind curiosity. Straight out of mythology, an Orpheus trailing a negative, one-headed Cerberus. And it was like Cerberus, this hound. You could see its head in triplicate, snarling and raging at the foolish dead and idiot brave intruders, staring them down with its piggy eyes, its teeth like tusks. The black dog and its white shadow. Death in different languages, creeping in unseen. The white wedding and the glowing bride in ivory silk and snowy lace and the pure cotton sheets hung out in the morning to show the gossips the stains of purity. The shroud. The whisper of ghosts. The pallor of the corpse and the heavy, fragrant lily. The many-headed hounds, powerfully alive.  They stroll on, unconcerned, past the ugly Safeways and the dark carpark, spitting out cars. The dog pauses to snuffle at walls, piss on saplings but never too far away, staying at heel.

      He stood on the path outside and I hung onto the edge of the door, peering round. Coy. He was going to leave, he said, head home. I said he could stay if he wanted. We could fuck. He said, violently? Maybe. Eyes downcast and flicked back up. Probably a flickering smile. Yeah, that's right. He slid back past me as I stepped back, swinging the door wider. Straight into my bedroom, just off the hall. We circled for a while, skirting the issue, looking at books and photos and the contents of my dressing table. Smoking an illicit indoors cigarette, high window open to negate the smell, ash tipped direct into the bin with the kitsch smiling swimsuited 50s lady. He lit candles with his lighter and turned off the main light, so everything was shadows. Our pupils were giant as we slouched on the bed, lounging on cushions, not touching. And there was a pause in our rambling conversation and he leant over and pushed me back, kissing me. Tongues and lips soft and deliberate, probing. Clashing teeth once provoking smirks. He pulled my top over my head and unhooked my bra as I lay with my back to him. Fumbling with jeans and dragging them down over my arse, trapping one of my feet inelegantly. I could feel the cloth of his shirt aginst my back. His hand tangled in my hair and he pulled my head back, hard, so I gasped and tears sprung to my eyes as he kissed my neck and my throat and my mouth. On my back on my bed, choked, flung around like a doll. I got tufts of his hair between my fingers and pulled his face to mine. We shook eachother, rolling on the white sheets, on all fours dragged back so my tits pushed out as he crushed me against him, on top grinding down on his cock sheathed in denim. My nose started bleeding and I wiped blood from his face. He asked if I had blood in my mouth and I laughed. I stripped off his shirt and his jeans. When we fucked he traced my body with his nails, clawing, light punches as I gasped and gritted my teeth. He held me to him as he came and we rocked for a while, breathing heavily.   In the morning, after he'd left, I picked the strands of my hair from the bedlinen and craned my neck to study the stinging scratch running up my spine, cut in half by my bra strap. I looked at the marks on my thighs. It was as much fighting as fucking. And I liked it.

      It's that feeling that starts in the centre of the chest and blossoms out, electric, until the vibrations spark shooting up and down the spine, to finger and toe tips. The scalp tingles, electrified. Torso quivering, poised. Flee or fight. I quiver like a bow string, plucked, as the voices play my nerve endings like piano keys and the shrill of the soprano thrills me and I shudder. The bass vibrates my ribcage. I feel it in the hollow of my throat, a body engulfed in a flood of sensations, orgasm-potent. For fifteen minutes, I'm wracked, before the hypnotic bows lull me and the woodwind register harmonising and the padded percussion rises and falls, rises and falls with its tempo thud. They held me in thrall, these human voices, the swooping soloists and the great body of the choir. Missa Solemnis. Indeed.

      Recently, I felt like cutting a line across my face, just below my right eye, grazing the top of my cheekbone. Hair thin, blistering blood, split edges pallid. I wanted to hurt, to scar my stupid face, make people double take. Fuck the beauty myth. Brand myself. Not this forearm bullshit where tiger stripes lace up and down, silvery white and the swollen red pink slashes of too recently. When I'm at work I wear a plaster to cover the worst. The old ones faded years ago, hardly warrant a second glance, let alone comment, but these recent wounds blare like klaxons. But then, you want people to see, don't you? You want to be tortured and fragile and special, although it's so fucking widespread now you can see the gasp of a yawn flit across faux-concerned faces. So passe. Not worksafe, though.  At home I have a cache of razor blades, smooth as silk and gleaming like silver fish. I threw them away before my five year happy net and then I had to go through the tedious rigamarole of breaking the plastic casings apart with my fingers, the snap and crack and the whisper of steel cutting into my hands. I hold them loosely and hide them in my jewellery box. Beauty and the Beast, so kitsch, it plays the Disney theme. How apt. I test the edge with the tip of my tongue. I hold them to my cheek and face myself in the mirror, eyes fogged with pain and detatchment and boredom and curiosity. What if.  But I won't do it, I didn't. Vanity. A cut across the gross symmetry of eyes and mouth and nose and chin. I have a good face, a pretty face, and sometimes it sickens me. Sometimes I'm proud.

      I'm off out tonight, to sunny scruffy Watford, where one of my flatmates is having her leaving do. She's been living down here with us, see in our fabfun house, but having to commute back up out of London everyday, time and money and flowing against the grain. All the commuters at Euston flooding past her in their stiff navy suits and crisp white suits while she fights threw them, jostled by sharp-edged briefcases, to catch the train that fleets her out of London and away. Watching the town recede around her, the old sooted walls of Victorian redbrick scattering into grey semis with weed-filled gardens, tainted brambles spreading over the fences and onto the tracks. We ate the railway blackberries when we were younger, that old cliché of berry stained lips and fingers dotted by the light brush of thorns. Out past Wembley now and suburbia, overnight washing limp on the line, shirts and skirts and boxer shorts strung up by faded plastic pegs. She's got a transfer now, will immerse herself in City life. Soon she'll breathe the heavy air as easy as fish in water, filtering it through her gills. This journey will be occasional, at weekends, trips to see family and friends.  Watford's a hole, a commuter dungeon, all grey and ringroads and chains. Some out of town offices, print works, sweetie central. We'll be heading to the main strip, where hordes of teens swarm, flashing their tits to get past the boorish bouncers or waving bottles of Bud in the street. It's all pedestrianised, save for the snaking cycle paths and the predictable police vans, waiting to scoop up trouble. Like dogcatchers. They're only lacking the nets. There's a shallow rectangular pond, surprisingly large, a water feature intended to cheer up the town in the daytime. It houses the occasional duck and a raft of floating muck, skimmed off daily by the council. Bad idea, but you could see that, couldn't you? Inside, the bars are all pine floored and chrome. Where they have carpet it's sticky with spilled drinks, so your feet suck and pull as you move. And rammed full of bleary, sweating, smiling faces, lit-up by alcohol glow, jostling for more. Even the pricey bars are cheap.  And that's where I'm headed. I've already winged out my eyeliner and stashed my red lipstick in my bag. I was frightened to wear it a year ago, too much of a slut, too much of a challenge. But I'm digging the 50s style now, with dark, dark eyes and a strong mouth. I've got my new top in my bag, printed with love hearts. Cute. Kitsch. Adorable. We'll have fun. We'll drink vodka cocktails and get giggly drunk and talk to boys. We'll be in no fit state.

      If someone tapped me on the top of my head, I think I would split like an egg, neatly in half. One of those Russian dolls but without the new me inside, ever in miniature, smaller and smaller until less than pinprick point. I am lost in the maze of self and pity and both, labyrinthine ropes twisting around me as I flail blindly, hitting out at the grappling strands. And oh-so fragile. Cracking like porcelain, with the same foolish fake smile plastered over my face like wallpaper, stained with the seep of tears and the moist saliva of breath and speech. Masked. I could reach inside the cage of my ribs and hold my heart in my hands, trembling like a bird, flesh and feather. In the palms of my hands. If you held me too close my bones would snap and shatter, hollow. If you ran your hands up my spine it would crumble. My skin would fall in sheets at your touch. My mouth would open up like a wound to your kiss.  One day, I'll be shatterproof.

      Ohohoh, my beautiful commute. Out the house at eight and a lovely stroll down Holloway Road, fluttering plastic bags tangling round my ankles. There's a tree that glitters in the sun, myriad strips of some substance have been died to its boughs like ribbons. I look at them and try to work out what they are, who put them there, why, but it offers up no answers. Sparkle. I try to remember to hold my breath when I go under the railway bridge because it's bad luck not to, right? Once I almost suffocated myself going under one of those endless bores on an endless motorway. Taught me a lesson, that did. Without practise, I can't last more than about a minute. I do practise though, at home. Gives you quite a rush, that oxygen gasp.  Down the spirally stairs at the tube. Fuck the lift, it's slow and rickety and has an ear-numbing, whining beep. Also, stairs make me feel healthy, and a little bit dizzy. The Piccadilly line's packed, as always, so I squash on, pressing my nose and my chest into the back of whichever lucky businessperson refuses to crush further in. I haven't been caught in the doors, yet. But I bury my head in strangers' shoulderblades and wait for the swish as the door slides over me. King's Cross sees them spewing out though. Sometimes I even get a seat, so I can read my Metro in relative peace. The smell of pressed people's ok at the moment, but come the summer heat and it'll be sickening. I may go all olde worlde with a perfumed handkerchief.  Out at Covent Garden and squashed among blank-eyed commuters, cattle-herded into lifts. The florescent light makes everything sallow. It's too early for the market buskers, different ones every day. Painted statue-people, limbs trembling. I circle them, give them wide berth. Maybe I look like I'm grimacing. Maybe I am.

      Coming back from the bathroom all giggly on wine and into a strange familiar room. One last cigarette propped cross-legged on the double bed, deep inhalations and the hint of a catch in the throat. More and more smoking, gathering it all in and spitting it out, the nicotine and tar and ash, plumes from nose and mouth and gently drifting up and out. Haloes, wreathed in smoke in the dim glow of the bulb. He'd been sitting in the chair, chest on show, long black trousers catching over his feet. Now a dim shape under the swell of lumped duvet. Fag ground out. Is it ok... Unfastening the hooks and zips of pinstripes and sliding them down over hips, falling to the floor. Top pulled up over breasts and shoulders and head and folded, semi-neat, over the chairback. Poised for minute in black bra and navy knickers stretched taut over curves, pale skin gold in the gloom, sliding into bed. Hands drawn up by face and knees gently bent. Held from behind legs tangled together, thighs laced through thighs, feet scraping shins and calves, forearm brushing chest. Moving together, comforting, rubbing skin. Turning and meeting in first kiss, exploring the ridges on the roof of the mouth, toothpaste tinted breath, tongue-tied.

      A girl lived in a cottage on the wind-scoured face of a steep, bleak mountain. The slopes dropped away below her and the gales howled and whipped frothy clouds up from the depths of the valley. She grew her own food in a garden surrounded by twisted boughs bent into fences that protected the thin soil from the ravages of the wind. Meagre supplies of barley and potatoes and carrots and beans that she stewed over a crackling fire until they formed a thick, glutinous broth. There were a few scrawny goats and ragged sheep that she left hay in the winter and trenches filled with water in the parched summers. In return they allowed her to take their watery milk to make sour cheese and shear their wool for knitting into greasy clothing.    Awkwardly cobbled on to the back of the house stood a rickety dovecote. Originally it had been freestanding, but the rain had battered it and the wind had torn off its eaves and the bitter sun had started to warp its planks. She had painstakingly dismantled it and reassembled it close to her, in safety. And the doves had come flocking. Where once it had housed a meagre selection of birds with tattered feathers and dull eyes, now every morning a gleaming fleet spewed out, white and grey and softly mottled. She lavished them with attention, singing to them, lining their house with the softest grass fibres, collecting and repacking their down. Sometimes at night she crept into the dovecote and huddled down among them, their plump warm bodies packed about her, lulled by their cooing, brushed by their wings.   As the days grew longer and milder, before the heat of high summer, she took to sitting at the end of her garden, arms hugged round knees, staring out across the valley. She'd seen activity there and she was curious. She could barely remember other people: she could hardly remember how she'd ended up here in her little cottage, cut off from the world. She couldn't remember if her isolation was self-imposed or inevitable. All she knew was that she was alone, with only her animals and the sharp tongue of the wind for company. When she opened her mouth she had almost forgotten how to speak: the only time she remembered the words were when she sang to her birds, and sometimes they sounded meaningless to her ears.   And the day came when she went down, arms full of itchy wool, and she saw a figure on the hillside opposite, staring back. Her mouth gaped and the bundle fell to the ground. She stood frozen, startled, caught in the beam of his regard. Silently they gazed, burning across the divide. Behind her, the doves wheeled and turned and she spun on her heel and ran back to her house, dust puffing in her footsteps. That night she borrowed deep into the heart of the dovecote and lay awake among the soft, musty scent of their feathers. They settled and shifted above her, and in the dark of the morning a solitary bird crept up and nestled in the hollow of her throat.   Every day ahe would rush down and stare out across the valley, hands resting on the branches and pushing her out blindly across the void. Sometimes she caught sight of him as she worked her vegetable patch or tended her sheep, saw him watching her. And likewise she watched him, half-hidden by leaves, as he went about his business of building his own house. He'd cleared the dry ground and had dug in ditches to catch the dew and the infrequent rain. The foundations had been finished weeks ago and the house was almost complete. Sometimes he waved at her, great sweeps of his arms, and she felt her stomach dissolve in butterflies. She smiled and raised her hand in return, shielding her eyes from the glare of the sun so she could better see him. She took to singing into the emptiness, and as time passed she began forming her own songs and learning her own words. She had discovered her voice again. She could see him mouthing words but couldn't discern their meaning.   Her doves grew fat and their feathers gleamed. They flocked across the sky, catching the updrafts across the valley and swooping and diving in formation and alone. She took preasure in their beauty and their wellbeing, spoiling them with treats of grain that she should have been stockpiling for winter. She was incautious, consumed by excitement and happiness.    But summer passed and the house on the hillside was complete. The days were darkening and a touch of chill caught in the bones. And then came a dreadful clamouring from the skies and a horde of birds wheeled down, supporting a frail bundle in their midst. She sprang to her feet, reaching her hands up, and a small, warm body fell into her palms. A dove, gleaming white, with an arrow buried deep in its breast. She clasped it to her heart, eyes wide with horror as its wings stretched and fluttered feebly. The bright stain spread and ran and soaked her hands with blood and the bird's eyes, turned up to hers, dulled in the waning light. She turned her head and saw the shadowy figure opposite retreat into his house, longbow clasped in his hand. The door slammed shut.   She screamed wordlessly in the night and the doves came spiralling down, closing round her like a swarm of bees. But there was no comfort to be found and they pecked at her mercilessly as she covered her face with her hands, beaks and claws tearing at her, opening up hundreds of tiny cuts, lacerating her tender skin. And then they arrowed up and away and she was left alone, curled in on herself, silent. Her eyes wept like wounds.   She crawled into the empty dovecote and lay, foetal, on the floor, listening to the night and the wind, crying bitterly. After a time there was the rustling of wings and she gazed fearfully into the blackness. But they crept in gentle, one after the other, and laid rosepetals on her broken skin to soothe her and huddled up against her, quiet and trembling in the dark night.

      Sushi got shattered last night. I long for slim slendertone thighs and a taut abdomen and have lived on raw fish and rice for the past few weeks. But is scrawny scrawny the way forward, drumstick calves with the skin hanging off all stringy and fibrous and pick your teeth with bones? Plump, voluptuous curvy laydees with smooth satin skin. Edible. A mouthful of that would be round and fat and flavoursome. Bust spilling out over tops, proud and full in tight t-shirts. Carve just a little slice, like parma ham, better with the fat on. Shape like an hourglass just waiting for hands to circle the waist, cup the heavy breasts. It almost feels good. But then I think of antelopes and long lean limbs and the creamy goat cheese turns sour in my mouth.

      The fan's whirring in the corner of the office on the boss' desk but the fug in the air is palpable. Heat and pressure, warm cheeks and sweaty fingertips on the grubby cream keyboard. The airconditioning's been switched off at the request of my more fragile colleagues,whose sparrow bones and delicate swathes of flesh are susceptible to the chill. I can hear the traffic through the shut windows, drifting up from the gauntlet of the Strand. The air's still anyhow, although if we pushed the glass panes out a breeze might slink in to dust our brows, lift our fringes. Noise and mugginess under the lowering clouds pregnant with smog. We don't get pea soupers these days but the atmosphere's the same: if we went back to the flickering gas lights lining the cobbled streets and the stink of coal smoke the coils would creep up and round and into our lungs. Instead we're high on diesel fumes and first hand-second hand smoke and aerosols and the shimmering fuel dump of aeroplanes on the way to Heathrow and Gatwick and City.  For some reason I've been thinking about frogs with their slimey smooth skin, soft as velvet. Mossy green or streaked brown and yellow, spotted in camoflague print. They crouch dry in the palm of the hand, legs tensed to push off in a gigantic leap, of prowess, not faith. Or maybe faith, jumping blindly, senselessly to water and submergence. Eyes skimming the surface ready to duck back into the twists and tangles of algae and pondweed, kicking through the murk. If you catch them in the water they slip through your hands, slick and insubstantial, the shifting bones and tendons a tactile memory between the crush of your fingers. The memory of a body, the scrape of webbed toes. A camel through the eye of a needle in the closing grip.

      Oh god oh god oh god bury head deep into pillow, scrunching forehead into body-warm cotton and hollow stuffing. Legs up into foetal ball wrapped round by arms locked knuckle-white, interlaced fingers squeezing too tight. Eyes grimaced close, lashes disappearing in the folds of delicate silk lid-skin. Knees pressing into breasts, toes curled, simian. And the awful churning in the stomach and sickening burps rising in the gullet. Shifting position pushing torso flat against the slight give of the mattress, spreadeagled with arms out above head, hair flung back damp at the roots. Mouth gaping open, tongue gurgling on too much saliva. And the awful animal groaning, tossing and turning, pulling limbs in and out to shift away from nausea and apathy and get up, awake, reach for water and headache pills and the cool white porcelain of the loo, face resting on the seat. Retching and hacking up clear acidic bile that burns the throat and dribbles in great frogspawn strings from loose lips. Water makes it worse, roiling in the lower intestines, un ugly, uneasy sloshing. Coca cola, that's the remedy. Sweet and sickly and bubbly, alkaline bubbles to calm the stomach and kickstart the salt/sugar reserves. Body superfuel in racy red cans. Sticky mouth and squeaky furry teeth. Taken with high dosage pain erasers: ibuprofen, paracetomol, paramol. And in an hour, a trip to the Millenium Café to gorge on sausages and bacon and beans and eggs and tomatoes and more coke, neatly poured into skinny glasses. Dark wood furniture and tiled floor, pay at the back when you've finished. Staff who query your orders with eyebrows raised, condescending incomprehension. Cutting the portions into bite size bits and spearing it all on a fork: a corner of toast, a sliver of bacon, four beans, some yolk, the skin and seeds of a tomato, a shrivelled cylinder of sausage. Mouth stretched wide, wrapped round the metal prongs. Palm up to cover bulging cheeks, eyes popping wide in amusement and satisfaction. Crowded round the table, heads bent over food and into conversation, the antics of the night before, solving boyfriend trouble, plans for the weekend ahead.

      The manager promised us that people would turn up later, even though it was quarter to ten and the streets were as dead as the rotten fish that washed up on the banks of the Thames. Terminally. We went in anyway though, it was open 'til late and free to get in before the magic turning point of the hour. Depositing business cards in the champagne bucket for our chance to be lucky winners in the monthly draw. A bottle of bubbly arriving at the office! Any excuse for an early finish and celebration. Or rather, celebration of early finish. We clopped down the stairs in our heels and spilled into a deserted club. Granite slabbed bar, red walls and low ceilings. Dim lighting, wall-to-wall mirrors, stools covered in oxblood leather. We propped the bar, stroking the smooth surface with our long arms, resisting the desire to press our cheeks against the cool rock. It could have been the set of a risqué video, or a very special type of gentlemen's club. I drank wine and the others drank spirits, elegantly louche on our own. Smoking Silk Cut Silver to lower the tone, seduced by the packaging, 'ooh, I  must  have those'! The DJ bobbed his head in his shut-away room with the half stable door, upper body moving and grooving, hand to headphones. We laughed and drank and watched for shadows on the stairs, signalling new arrivals. But it was only the manager coming to check on us, and the pretty Spanish bar staff. The teases! We cheered when genuine customers appeared.  Later, when the floor filled, I waltzed and span to Dancing Queen with a journalist. A man with an open shirt and unknotted tie held the floor in thrall, grabbing the wallflowers who gripped their drinks and clung to the sidelines, boys and girls. Men in suits and women in linen work shifts. I walked back though Monument, with the oppressive tall buildings crowding on either side, searching for a black cab to spin me out of the City, North and home.

      After days of baking heat comes the flood. Raindrops bounce off scalded skin and slip down peeling noses and runnels of cleavages. Soggy city-types shelter under flimsy umbrellas, batwing swathes of taut black fabric and spiderleg spokes. Damp suit shoulders and pavement splashback soaking shoes and too-long trouser hems. Everything grey, slate roofs, concrete, pitted tarmac, morose, threatening cloud banks, pinstripe jackets, bankers' hair, omnipresent pigeons puffed up fat and pecking disconsolately at sodden litter. London proves a sullen obstacle course in the rain. The puddle dance, skipping in pointy spikes and flats in a merry Irish jig, kicking up fountains with every miss-step. Urban frogger, dodging traffic skidding round the corners on amber, horns blaring, wipers on full swoop. Dodging the dirty waves of street water sent spuming by streaming double-deckers and vans with their wheels in the gutter. Overflowing drains and rivers channeled and pooling making lakes out of paving slabs and mangrove swamps out of roundabouts. Steamy windows on the tube and droplets hanging from fringes and dripping into eyes, smudged mascara.  Chin in hands staring out the rain-smeared windows on the fourth floor at the grubby facades across the Strand. Aerials caught in the cross wind wobbling against the satellite dishes. Dreaming of blazing sun and burning white sand and salt water riming knees and elbows and thighs. Sweat-drenched. Glacial streams spiraling down mountains from the granite outcrops down through mossy pools and clinging tendrils of hair-fine weeds. The cheerful gurgle and chuckle of folklore. We were told not to drink from the trickles that cascaded down the smooth rock faces and cut through the peat but it was icy in our hands and against our hot foreheads and we cupped it in our palms and sucked noisily, slaking our thirst. Mineral deposits, specks of silicone, glass and sand. Snow-melt in the Scottish highlands, snowballs in summer. The still satin surfaces of hidden locks, depth black at the centre and mirroring the fringing of pines. Sitting on lichen-muralled rock and dangling our feet in the lake, chasing translucent fish with our toes.

      Midnight-oh-one. Sliding blunted nails under envelope flaps, peeling the spit-sticky glue. Breaking the paper seal. Cards fluttering into my lap, happy messages, happy birthday. Pretty pictures, achingly wannabe-cool Vogue print, humour. Cardboard butterflies spread skewiff on the heaped quilt. Opened by area, by author, segmented. Family last. Parents before siblings. Check the postcode, aunties and uncles first. The occasional cheque spilling out, sorted from the forlorn, ripped envelopes, spent on the side. Wrapping paper bright coloured, brown paper parcels and shielding bubblewrap, stylised flower-printed tissue. Sellotape stretched on every edge and corner, twisted into tacky plastic bangles. No cheating, no scissors or knives or keys. Elegant nimble stubby fingers. Brushing surfaces with supercharged tips. Slick and shiny. The ritual, the ripping, the anticipation. Torn leaves of paper littering the floor, indoor autumn, feet-stirred. Presents piled and grasped in eager paws, turned over, inspected, stroked with the back of a hand.  I waited until my official birthday morning, didn't I? The bag was sitting at the foot of my bed since Sunday evening, presents passed on by parents from relatives, from them. That's a wait of a day and a bit, even if I wasn't there, was slaving at work and at corporate parties and didn't come home until ten to midnight, rolling down the road innocently inebriated. Willpower, that's what it shows. Admirable self-restraint.

      It was my flatmate's workmate's birthday and, having no other plans, I thought I'd tag along for the ride. Flushed from the walk from Camden up the Kentish Town Road, tugging distractedly at the sleeves of my t-shirt to stop them sticking to my deodorant, scowling at beeping drivers in their dirty vans. The Pineapple's hidden up a residential street near Kentish Town tube. Sugar-candy houses, pastel painted and square-roofed. Very Med, with pretty gardens and white sash windows. The pub itself's a strange mix, jumbled memorabilia, fruit-themed and prickly. Scaled pineapples flying on the wall in place of ducks, lampshades shadowing the squat gnarled bodies. Clinetele just as much of a mish-mash, from the white haired old men sitting at the table in the corner with their terriers, supping pints of bitter to the slightly hip young things braving the scudding clouds in the beer garden. My friend was firmly ensconced in a corner, surrounded by older men. I'd never met her colleagues before but they were affable enough, drinking lager and chaining cigarettes. My slimline 10-pack seemed rather spartan and my house white out of place. Chips always go down well though, dunked in Heinz.   Later, drunker, we moved more central, tube into London, more cash from the dispenser. My friend and I got in free on the birthday boy's 'know the owner' tip. I ordered a whiskey and coke at the bar and saw my error as it spilled down my top and onto my boots, jostled. After that I moved onto Becks, bottled beer to be swung with abandon. The club was like a student union music-wise, A-HA to Aerosmith, the White Stripes and the Strokes mixed into Push It and the Clash and the Stones. No irony or a bit too much? Good fun with flailing limbs and grinning glistening faces. I counselled a gorgeous girl in the loos who kept assuring me that women didn't need men to have a good time, earnestly wagging her finger and swaying, braced against the sinks.  A boy caught my eye, cruising the dancefloor, searching for friends. I caught him at the bar, sliding next to him and turning, beer in hand. Do you come here often? I laughed at myself, face tipped upwards. We traded gambits, openers, and then we were kissing, probing mouths with pointed, triangular tongues. Nipping lips, tracing gums. Back to mine, half-empty drink hidden under my coat, giggling on the night bus and taking swigs of the flattened fizz. He said this bit always made him nervous, the undressing, so I pulled off my top and sat, poised, in my bra and jeans, loose on my waist. We lay back, tan against the crumpled white sheets. Healthily filthy fucking. He had beautiful eyes and lips, angelic, and an extremely hairy torso. I went to sleep with my head on his chest and woke in the morning with wire-fine dents in my cheek.

      Hot sweaty nights tossing and turning and tangling legs in heavy duvets, damp sheets, damp brow. Waking disorientated at 4.30am and lying dull eyed as the sun filters through the green curtains. Side and front and back and side and front, recovery style. I dream. I dream of ponds in the garden overflowed, sleek-headed otters swimming towards me. I dream of chewing and chewing on hard toffee, my back teeth loosening and pulling and coming out, stuck in the viscuous sweet goo. I dream of hurricanes, sheltered in dry stone cottages in the highlands, roof tiles lifting and spiralling up up into the storm-grey sky. I dream of wolves at the door. I dream of backhanding my last fuck hard across the face mid thrust as he leaves fingertip bruises in the flesh at my waist. I dream of living in a world of fire, lava streets, every last human burned to a crisp instantly, machines and hybrids stalking the streets with flamethrowers unable to eat greenery, only barbecued flesh. I dream I try to drink water but it won't slake my thirst. I dream of being chased by faceless, toothy entities. I dream of sex with my exes and faceless strangers. I dream of falling through nothing.  Sometimes when I dream about fucking I wake up twitching from sleepgasms, wet dreams. I dream of eating and I wake chewing mindlessly at the pillow, patches soaked in saliva. I dreamt once that I shot myself in the head with a toy gun from a fairground stall, aiming for yellow plastic ducks and getting myself in the temple. I lay on the floor by the cliff, feeling the life seep out wet on the damp earth, colours dulling and fading. I woke up screaming.

      I saw someone die the other night, on the Southbound Victoria line, King's Cross to London Victoria. I can't remember what stations we were between, maybe Warren Street and Oxford Circus. Is that right? They're all a roaring blur of soot and tile and wire snakes. The carriage was empty, three sitting engrossed in books and the tiny lines on the back of our hands. There was a woman begging, rocking down between the seats with a dirty white plastic cup that she held close to our faces, asking for change. And she was dismissed with barely a glance and a muttered 'sorry'. I was last and I did have change, but it was in my nicely fastened purse in my nicely packed bag and my hands were full of novel and umbrella and instead of smiling and delving for silver coins I shrugged my shoulders and shook my head and murmured a weak excuse. And she shuffled on, stumbling slightly with the sway of the floor.   I watched her out of the corner of my eye as she braced herself by the connecting doors, watched her reach and open the emergency exit emblazoned with signs shouting 'DO NOT USE WHEN TRAIN IS IN MOTION' or some other banal warning. And I didn't stop her, didn't stand up, didn't do anything while she struggled with the doors, one leg in either carriage, jarred by the jolts of the tube as it wormed through the black tunnels. And then she was falling, falling, her thin body sucked through the gap, legs, thigh, hips, all vanishing, swallowed by the grinding, rattling space. Waist, breasts until only her small head was left, gaping mouth, wide eyes, silent. And then it was gone, swept away. I imagined it crushed like a bird, delicate bones cracking and snapping beneath the churning wheels. The brakes screeched and the doors slammed and we pulled into a station. Frozen. My heart was beating fast, fluttering crazily aginst my ribcage. I looked around but there was only the cough of the man across from me and the faint rasp of paper as he flicked pages. The crowds poured in at Oxford Circus and I sat dumb, imagining the gore on the wheels and shards of bone on the tracks. When I left the train at Victoria I felt the crunch of plastic under my feet.

      Sunbathing. Slowly basting in sweat and oil, rotating side on side on back on front in the oven of the garden. Slowly leaking, gasping for more liquid to replenish the lost fluids, staying plump and shiny and sleek and glossy. We glow, girls, not perspire. Our bodies radiate heat several degrees higher than body temperature, than optimum. We shed our excess energy, haloing us in the haze of infra-red, pink, fuzzed air. Stretching, arching backs and twitching legs, licked by the silent murmuring rays. Shins prickling, swell of bust superheating, touched with the back of the hand it burns. We toast, happily, bright white of the light shielding our eyes from the crisping skin. The sun bleaches, strips colour from the leaves and the grass and the forearms we rest our heads upon. Prone on stomachs on the rust rug studded with scratchy hay of lawn clippings. We pick seeds from our sticky stomachs and shade our eyes with our palms and oversized sunglasses.  In the cool of the bedroom I strip off my clothes and twist to see my back in the mirror, head craned back. The dark brown-red of early burn. I came in early, feeling the heat stroking my shoulderblades, tightened skin receptive and sensitised. No lines. I'd pulled down my bra to scald off my previous strapmarks, to make my back a flat, even expanse of tan, marred only by a smattering of dark moles and sex scratches. The bra marks glowed red, tender to touch. Sunday evening. Sunny sunny day. I thought of all the people splayed on the beaches, row after row of stripy towels and sweaty bottles of suncream. Lined up like prawns at the fishmonger, bright lobster red, foreheads glistening, faces screwed in concentration, against the glaring white circle of the sun.

      Have you ever looked in the mirror and thought blimey, I look haggard, been surprised by a wrinkle that’s appeared out of nowhere overnight? Or have the signs of ageing crept up on you slowly and it’s only when you’re caught by surprise (in the florescent light of a supermarket reflected in the freezer section) that you realise that you don’t look quite like you used to? Hmm? Skin a bit looser? Dark pouches under your eyes? Strange creases imprinted in your cheek when you wake up from, god forbid, a doze? Has gravity grabbed at you and started to tug? Perhaps you’re comfortable with it, maybe you don’t care, maybe you hate it and fight to stave off the first signs.  Anyway. Our society seems increasingly age-obsessed. Rows of identikit slebs/society gels lining up to get botoxed up to the eyeballs (well eyebrows, unable even to twitch). The weird, blank, bland faces staring from the covers of gossip mags and premiere party pics. Face-lifts, eyelid tweaking, chemical abrasive treatment (peels) to strip the top layer of skin off (‘smooth, sweetie, smooth'), more more more. There’s plastic surgery to make you look better, sure, but increasingly looking better seems to be a quest for youth. Desperation? Why? What’s wrong with growing old gracefully? Is there something hideous in wearing your character on your face or is it precisely that which we’re attempting to erase? Even if succumbing to surgery is too drastic, there’s hundreds of lotions and potions to slow the onset of the dreaded signs of old age. Suntan lotion is advertised not only on its cancer-halting strengths but also on its merits as a skin preserver: sun damage causes wrinkles and the early onset of ageing! Ageing is practically advertised as another illness, but, horribly, an irrevocable one. And no-one’s immune. Perhaps this is the horror: something you can’t escape, that stamps its signs on you as surely as a burn, or a cut. Lack of choice in a society where myriad opportunities are all. Not so much raging against the dying of the light as something else far more insidious.   Last winter, sitting in the cold at London Bridge having missed my train, somewhat the worse for wear. I thought I’d attempt to get some reading in although the words had gone all swimmy and blurred and my hands were trembling in the cold. My hands. I focused on them, clutching the book open. Something strange about them. The crease between my thumb and first finger was all wrinkled and dry. My skin was loose and sagged like an old person. Like a crumpled up money paw. I flexed my fingers and the skin stretched and rumpled, not springing back into shape with the elastic snap I’m used to. I was horrified and put the book away, burying my hands in my pockets. Out of sight, out of mind. But not, really. Maybe drink had made me maudlin and bitter. Jaysus! I’m only bloody 22! I can’t be ageing already! I went home and smothered my hands with super strong hand cream, part of a raft of products to ‘protect and prevent’. Day moisturised (SPF, natch) night moisturiser, lip treatment, 8 hour cream. Sometimes I study my face and wonder where the wrinkles will start appearing, and whether I will wear them with pride or attempt to blitz them away with treatment after ridiculous treatment. The former, I hope, but I’m a marketing victim and get sucked in to all the ‘beauty is youth!’ campaigns that shout from every wall, screen, magazine.

      Every little girl wants to be a ballerina, don't they? Well, I did. Until I went to dance classes and discovered I couldn't even plié properly and spent the hour a morose mass of humiliation. And  bend  and straight and  bend  and straight. My legs just don't work like that I'm afraid, miss. But as a five year old, what do you do? Go bright red and weep uncontrollably. Anyhow, I was a failure at ballet and tap and salsa and I never even tried jazz. I'd like to be able to swing or dirty dance (I'll leave the Swayze-a-likes, thanks all the same), spinning and twisting and sliding through legs, flung up in the air. Good wholesome fun, with bobby socks and alice bands.  At lunchtime I wandered into Covent Garden and slunk into Monsoon. Debt generation, credit happy. Ball on Saturday, dressless. The shop's a riot of colour and texture, silk, satin, devoré, linen. Cerise, lemon, sky blue, dusty rose, black, cream, ruby. Studded with sequins and beads, hemmed with marabou and gem-bright ribbon. I dragged them from the rails and hooked them over my arm, disappearing under floating swathes of fabric. Summer weight material. In the square hot changing cubicle, hidden by a swatch of curtain, I pulled them on. Knee length pleated skirt in baby pink? Lovely but pricey. No. Strapless dress in gauze and a shiny material that rustled and shook? A size to big, gaping at the bust and hanging sadly at the hips. Third time lucky. Crushed raspberry, ruched and boned across the torso and chest. Skirt skimming out and swishing below the knee. Spaghetti-thin straps, no bra (and that's a rarity, I promise). Body fitted, like the clichéd glove. I pranced, on tiptoe (the flipflops killed the look). Even work-stale I looked good. This was it. This was my princess dress. My ballerina dress.

       click   Taut-bodied. Hair buzzed close to the scalp in the regulation style. Weight of loyalty and servitude tight round the neck, near choking. Fingers calloused and rubbing at the rust of the ring and the lock that connects him, chains him into the unit. Blind obedience, artificially, physically instilled. Single-mindedly working toward the goal, protection and progress. The new elite. He stands in the maw of the passage straight as a rod, eyes narrowed shards. There is threat here, and he has been sent to erase it. Terminate. But it is also initiation, and dream talk and desire and the last vestige of free will. Jumbled together, entangled steel wire spun to fine shreds of wool, inseparable. He will not allow confusion and merely accepts. The reports. There was a shadow here the other night. Spinning, a whirligig of energy flickering in and out of sight. The scouts have seen it and whisper wordlessly in the barracks at night. He has seen it, imprinted on the back of his eyelids. He breathes it as he rests and it taints his sleep curious colours. He stands alone in the gloaming.   click   The cavern gasps cold and echoes the screaming wind, the high pitched shriek as it flees through gullies and the bass booming howl that shudders the frozen lake. Sound rimes the surfaces in the creak of the sheet ice and the crackle of frost on rock. Far out on the frozen straits she skids and slides, fawn-clumsy on coltish legs. Her gracelessness dictates her yet she laughs as she dances, hurtling haphazard among the stones and the dipped channels. Her feet are bloody and pale, goosebumped in the chill, shredded by the cutting ridges of dead waves. The ghostlight sucks out warmth, casting everything shadowed and green-grey. She has always been here but it has changed. It had been green and lush, a subterranean glade but now the flowers have faded and shrivelled and the trees loom blackened and iron-hard. Every day the ice advances and she shrinks a little. She tried the tunnels, blindly pushing her way outward, face turning towards the suggestion of light and heat. Creeping out the mouth the outside world confused her and she fled back into the familiar twilight and the litany of snow.   click   The labyrinthine tunnels swallow him and the phosphorescence fogs his senses and clouds his enhanced night vision, casting halos and duplicates so he stumbles stretched out before him. He scrapes the rough walls, rubbing raw patches at jutting elbows and shoulderblades and pelvis. His skin is shadowed by the whip marks of sudden bruising. Breath huffing in cloud wisps of moisture hang heavy and sink compact to the floor. His shirt has caught on sharp contours, jagged granite edges, and hangs tattered. He clasps it round him like a shroud as he shivers and shuffles onward. He can feel it deep in his chest, a vibration of the ribcage and the answer to the wheeze in his lungs. The sprite hovers before him as his eyes blink and roll and his eyelashes thicken white. He swipes and the vision dissolves before him, hand passing through veil-fine ice.   click   She has come to rest on the shore and sprawls loose-limbed across the grey sand. The glass particles gleam and a glaze shifts slightly, sticking to her skin like glittering mud. The beach is hard, the chill seeping upwards and aching bones. Even the sand is frozen near-solid. Her hair tangles down her back and over her breasts, ropes of filthy brown. Sometimes she breaks through the ice, hammering with flint to reach the sluggish water. She scrubs at her face and her body and her hair but she can never get herself quite clean. Slowly, stiffly, she pushes herself up, muscles in her arms tightening and back arching. She tastes grit and her tongue sticks to the roof of her mouth. Her bubbling laugh cracks through parched lips. She cracks the surface with a pointed stone and striking fist, snapping of the splinters that claw and rip and scratch. She has learnt this much of her new environment, of its edges. Kneeling, she drinks from the pool through chattering teeth, jaw clenched at the bite of the cold. Shuddering, she lowers her face, sinking the piles of her heavy hair and rinsing with numb fingers. She flings back her head and her hair whips back, water cascading down her back and thrown in showers of droplets, hitting the floor as half-formed sleet. Half-turning she catches sight of him, a slumped silhouette carved silent as the ice that backs him.   click   They kneel, lip-locked. He holds her by the upper arms as if trying to keep her at a distance, but he can’t pull himself away. He sees his duty hanging before him and behind him, closeted deep in his mind but he can taste her and smell her and touch her. Suppressed desire, ruthlessly eradicated, rises up in him and he kisses her cruelly, voraciously. She runs her hands across his body, circling the broad reach of his shoulderblades and the smooth track of his back, the ridge of his spine. She reaches up to touch the iron at his neck but he pulls away and she senses it is forbidden. Her eyes drop closed as she gives herself up to the roil of emotions flooding her. She reaches down, stroking the plain of his navel, tracing the wiry hair that springs under her questing fingers.

      Bugs. They're everywhere at the moment, crawling over skin and hair and nails and glass. Ants on our kitchen surfaces, sucking up the sticky ribena rings the bottle leaves behind. We clean and polish and wash them down the sink, sweep them up in dustpan and brush and put them back outside but they keep coming back. Sometimes they disappear for a while, before sending scouting missions, ones and twos, to investigate. Track the terrain. Recce. We can't find the nest, they skitter over the concrete patio, up the old brick walls, lost in the borders and the scorched grass. Feeding the aphids on the rosebuds. Black and green, clustered together, insectoid hundreds and thousands. When you rub them off they burst, leaving dirty red smears on your fingertips.  I like the ladybirds, although my friend claims they bite. Certainly they piss spots of yellow on your palms when they cross them. The price you pay for good fortune. Only the shiny red and black spotted type - the yellow ones crouch malevolently. And then the reverse-spotted red on black, demonic. Ladybird ladybird fly away home/your psychotic sibling's burnt it down and eaten your children. Doesn't quite scan. Hoverflies, yeah, I'm a big fan. Darting side to side, point to point, miniature insect hummingbirds. Cunningly disguised as wasps in their stripy armour. They whirr. I let them perch on my knuckles, catching them unaware, fleshy flowers. Not wasps. I kill on site, if possible. When I was younger one flew up under my skirt and stung me on the thigh. I balled it up and ran like hell, blubbering. When my mum coaxed the material out of my hands it was still there, crawling over infant legs. I won't forget the sting for a long time. Well, evidently, fifteen years later. Bees are a different though, bumbling along like tiny flying sheep. Sleepy, heavy, redolent of late Spring and Summer.  In the loo yesterday two beetles flew round, conjoined, stuck together end to end. I'm afraid I don't know much about the anatomy of insect genitalia. They flew out the window, joined at the hips.

      Clumsy. Dizzy. No sense of balance. I like to pretend that it's because, with my miniature feet and swelling bust I'm slightly off-centre all round. But I've recently reached the conclusion that it's something far more sinister. I trip, I stumble and fall. I part-quote lines from dreadful songs but that's besides the point. It's in my genes, although I haven't noted such flaws in my parents (although my mother was pushed off a style by her dog leaping past). Perhaps there's a sonic vibration juddering my bones or a microscopic flea salsaing in my inner ear.   I was in the shower the other day, hair slicked straight back across my head, otter-skulled. Cascading into my eyes and my mouth so I spat clear liquid, no phlegm. Semi-blinded. Balancing on one leg, braced against the wall, brandishing the mint green Gilette. I've taken enough chunks out of my shins to exercise more caution, really, but a wobbly hand and water steaming past seem precaution enough. Gliding over the skin, hand following to ensure smoothness. Satin, I'm sure the advert trumpets (not velvet, that suggests...furriness). Hunched over unattractively, chin by knee, toes clenched and white as they brace against the misted tiles. Back pressed against the fogged glass walls that form two sides. It's a stand-up job, not quite power, but I've never had a separate one before. I'm used to boiling drops dribbling from a handheld bath attachment. Even gilded and swish they fail comprehensively to do the job. So now I spend ages in the shower, flooded. All works, perfectly, apart from the shaving. No leg stretching, feet poised taut on the taps, long stretches of limbs. Undignified, here. And more so when the door pops open and I come spilling out, arms cartwheeling, legs indelicately spread. Landing in a damp heap on the ragged white bathmat, water spilling out behind me and puddling on the floor.

      It made her smile when it popped into her inbox. They were like this, sending eachother little tokens of affection, leaving post-its cut into heart shapes stuck to tables and work surfaces and inside shoes. I love you honey. Kiss kiss. I can't wait to see you again. I dream about you. I want you. Cards for birthday, valentine's, anniversaries, Christmas piled high in boxes. Postcards picked up in bookshops that meant something. Lady and the Tramp. Disneyfied cartoon happiness. The letters they wrote spanned pages, rustling, scented, sealed with a loving kiss. SWALK. In the email era their inboxes flooded as they poured their feelings onto blank white screen.   When they were together they clasped hands, curled round one another, constant contact. He lay with his head in her lap, looking up at her as she read her books, fiddled with his hair. Touching was ceaseless, unconscious. When they slept they held eachother, suffocatingly close. They breathed the same breath and soaked up the other's sweat. She shaved his head, running the buzzing clippers over his skull. Sometimes he trimmed her pubes, cutting patterns while she squirmed and laughed.  Their happiness, togetherness sickened people. Slowly their friends had drifted away and now they were alone. They ate and talked and fucked and slept in tandem. They watched the same films and read the same books and held the same opinions. They finished eachother's sentences with no-one to hear.

      They’d strapped it to his face a long time ago, and now it seeped into his pores and breathed his sweat. It moulded to him, he could feel the contours of his flesh settling into new patterns, deep whorls and gaping holes. The air tasted stale in his mouth, filtered through rotten teeth. Sometimes a strand of hair caught in his throat and coiled round his tonsils, making him retch and gag. He could feel the greasy ends brushing his shoulders, an unaccustomed feathering. He could smell nicotine and plastic and piss.  How long had he been sitting here, strapped firmly into the chair? The band ran under his clothes tight round his stomach and wrapped several times round his legs. His arms were crushed under his clothes, crossed across his chest and pulled behind his back. Was he in an institution? He couldn’t remember going mad. He thought there might be a cushion on his lap, some weight. Underneath he was scrawny, ribs showing dark beneath his pallid skin.  They drugged him, kept him intoxicated, high. At first he’d cried out but now he was silent, drifting every mow and then into coherency. But his mouth wouldn’t form words and he drooled and leered, head lolling against the restraints. Had they beaten him? There was a nagging ache in his pinioned arms, cramp or bruising or breakage. He couldn’t tell, drifting on soft clouds, enveloped in warmth and bonhomie and bafflement. He’d gone past paranoia, when he’d screamed senselessly and fought and bit. The gag was out now and he dribbled happily from the maw of his new mouth.  He could feel air on his face, unfamiliar. How long had he spent in the fetid dark, spoon-fed baby food and pissing through tubes? He shied from the light as it burnt his dead eyes, sparking cycles of spots and flashes that danced on the backs of his eyelids as he squeezed them shut. An unseen hand pushed him forward and he felt himself gliding, weightless. Voices murmured harsh over his head and he strained to hear them. He could smell smoke wafting past and feel the rosy warmth of fire reddening his face and hear the crackle of flames.

      Let's get one thing straight here: I might be signed in but I don't do chat. Not at work, oh no. I just like the little green man in the toolbar with his busy stop sign. The messages that bubble out and rise from his chest. The people popping up. Instant gratification. Connection. That's what it's all about. The thrill of new emails arriving, warm flush of belonging, feelers of emotion and fun and chat spreading out over the internet, piercing the technical aether.   I felt it like a kick in the stomach. The much-vaunted butterflies made flesh. How long had it been since we'd had contact? Gently sliding up the screen, bottom right hand corner and hovering, begging the click of the mouse. Open me. Dizzy. What? My heart leapt? My guts turned over? I can't explain it. The whole thing reeked of unhealthiness, the relationship was like an addiction. Sex and intensity and wanting more more more. Obviously it all came crashing down, ugly. It wasn't right but it felt good. Blame it on the chemicals, I say. Maybe we were radiating superstrength hormones. It started with fucking and it carried us through, reestablishing the touch and taste and smell of eachother night after night after night. It felt like it transcended that, as we whispered and murmured and shared our secrets, spilling the words in honeyed streams, our lives, our past, our pain. Oh tortured souls! How could we be misunderstood, unique, when we could understand? It shattered quite a few illusions, I can tell you. Eyes and scales and ripping come to mind. He helped me towards independence, to (oh cliché) loving myself. High dosage confidence injected into the spine, or somewhere lower down. Later, after it was all over, we spewed bile, doing our best to wound eachother, break down the defences. This hate was alien and absolute.  So the shock of the email, the anticipation, the physicality of my body. Unsuitable boys who move me. What are we doing, attempting to redefine our friendship? New channels to spin our marbles down.

      Chocolate puddle pudding. Divine. Squidgy sponge, rich, dark sauce floating in a pool of half-melted vanilla ice cream. My friend had bet that it would be a blob of pallid brown custard, wobbling anaemically in the bowl. Probably all we could expect after the microwaved mains. Ok, reheated to be fair, but when you order a roast and it turns up five minutes later with the vegetables slightly sweaty and the gravy skinned, you've got to wonder, haven't you? Tasted good though, nice meat, peas, yorkshire pudding fat in the mouth. A good dollop of horseradish, more creamy than firey. Roast potatoes practically needed carving mind. Back to the point. Pudding sitting glossy in the tub. Friends gaze enviously, salivating. Spoon poised. But wait! There's a face in the pudding, in the light/shade play on satin sauce. No Jesus but a Mona Lisa, perfectly proportioned, adorning the chocolate top. Gasp! Small smile playing on the lips. If you shifted the plate into a different light she vanished, ghostly. No-one else could see, until someone decided to humour me. But I sat, entranced, transfixed by the famous face. Spoon hovering in hand.  I ate round her, tried to jog the sticky coating of liquid. And it was delicious, rolling in my mouth and smoothing over my tongue. Sponge crumbs and sweet junk stuck behind my front teeth, coating my palatte. Licking the sauce with long, flat tongue, nibbling round the edge of the fork. Half-collapsed but the face remained. And I ate her. I ate the Mona Lisa. With half her head gone she was unrecognisable.

      It came in a big rectangular box with the photo scanned onto the side. Green and black with the text in red to stand out. In the catalogue they had it swathed in sausages, spitting chicken, sizzling steaks. Obligatory pints propped on the neat wooden shelves. It wasn't beautiful but it was slick, on its wheels with its shiny roasting fork. We carried it back, sweating in the midday heat. I'd grabbed a couple of stripey green folding chairs and the crackling plastic packaging slipped in my hands. I swore as one slid down and cracked against my shin. Drivers grinned out the windows at us as we tottered along, burdened.  When we got the thing home we emptied it out onto the living room floor. Well, tried. What we lack in there is space: two sofas, a big TV, a coffee table scattering papers and bills and takeaway menus. We creep round, sofa stealers pulling their knees up to their chins to stop trips and spillages: pasta and ribena and olives and wine. So, I took it into my bedroom and spread the parts out on my double bed. Four different types of bolts, two types of washers, two types of locks virtually identical, some hexagonal nuts. Long legs, short legs, the fabulous wheels (actually cheap black plastic with dirty cream inserts), grill pan, grill, fork. Axle. My housemate gave me a screwdriver and left me to it, staring blankly at the instructions. Diagrams with twenty different points. They say 'it might as well have been in Japanese' but it was quite straightforward. Just fiddly, tring to get to hold together a pole, a pan and three different parts of screw. All to mixed up bootleg Michael Jackson pulsing in the background. Thriller! I knelt on the floor and wrestled with the metal. I twisted and sweated and screwed. My calves and my feet cramped up all at the same time, aching, stabbing pains that shot through the muscles and wrapped (racked) round the bones. I danced to my feet and bounced around, cursing, working the knotlocks out. Pirouetting on tiptoes. My room is on the ground floor facing the street. What would they have seen, those passers by? A girl in dirty denim and faded pink Bambi top jittering dementedly round a half-baked barbeque. Satanic rites? The furnace, semi-constructed. Possession.  I wheeled it out eventually, proudly, after the unfortunate mishap of screwing the guard on upsidedown and having to reconstruct the damn thing. It was a little bit unsteady, wobbling but upright. It stood alone. Now it's been filled with charcoal and burnt out and smeared with grease it looks as it's meant to. Almost picture-perfect.

      Top deck of the bus again, in exactly the same position. It’s becoming something of a favourite, adjacent to the stairs so you can just swing into place and slump against the window, forehead pressed against the cool glass. This was the commute home on a Friday night and I got on near the start of the route at Aldwych. Space wasn’t exactly at a premium, the entire aisle unrolled before me like a corridor or that rarely seen phenomenon, an empty doctor’s surgery. Still, I swung and slumped, phone out to text my mother who called me back from Hadrian’s Wall, the wilds of Scotland sounding fresh in the background. Today I was the irritant, the gossip with the loud voice, talking about job progression and weekend plans and rucksack grazes and laziness. I wanted out too, but I was stuck in London for the weekend, baking in the slow heat, oven roasting. She spoke of yellow gorse carpeting the hills and the mist that hazed the purple mountains and the rough grey slabs of the Wall as they tramped along, snaking into nothingness at the far point of the eye. I peered out at the glowing green of the chestnut leaves, curling orange at the edges. Rain and bright, hot sunshine had sent London crazy and shoots and flowers sprung up in every park, weeds in every paving crack. The bus slid by under a canopy, shaded by branches and foliage and the occasional pigeon.  We halted at the traffic lights turning onto the Camden Road. My phone was neatly packed away, my mother had gone to shower and cook and eat in her B&B, alive with smiling friends and hosts and lovers. The red white twirling of a barber's pole caught my eye, candy cane horn rotating from the wall of a grubby shop. A gentlemen's barber, the shopfront declared. Dry cut £4, wet cut £6. Probably prices for cut throat shaving too, maybe even bleaches and dyes, but I didn't read that far. There were a couple of men inside, one tipped bank over the porcelain sink, neck craned uncomfortably. The other sank in a chair, swathed in the vampire cloaks of polyester beloved of the trade. A barber stood poised behind him, comb and scissors cocked, sleeking back the water-slick hair. Another man sat behind the reception, flicking through a magazine. About hair? I couldn't see. No women, no long blond curls littering the tiled floor. No rats tails of wet, snipped, heavy locks. Clippers and fat round bristle brushes and lotions and potions, citrus scents. All the bottles lined up, tools racked in front of the mirrors and ready to go. In the window there was a poster advertising product or stylist, Toni & Guy or some other mainstream dresser of tresses. Advertising. It was a picture of a woman with slashed, bobbed hair. A picture of a woman in black and white, in the corner of the barber shop window. I couldn't work out why.

      Boys and girls come out to play.  &nbsp;  In the summer, the roads are filled with the shrieks and screams of children playing, the thud of balls on tarmac and the patter-slap of soles slapping the pavement. As the moon hangs pale in the sky and the sun grazes the horizon, the voices bounce off the walls between the terraced houses, echoing in shrill scales and tinny abuse, the throaty edge of tearfulness and the backdrop of bubbling laughter. Old games of hopscotch and skipping and tag and stick-in-the-mud. Rooted to the spot in a stylised X, waiting for rescue, unsticking. Please Mr Crocodile, may I cross the water. The girls in red and multi-colours get across first and touch the far wall and run squealing back to safety. The grinning reptile mask plastered over the face of their chaser, arms outstretched to catch. Kiss chase, running a bit too slowly and hiding behind insubstantial bushes, veering into front gardens and clanging gates behind them. Arms pulled at the sockets as small hands grab saplings to swing round, quick turn. Out of the road as the cars crawl past, huffing drivers blaring their horns, red-faced at the wheel. Scattering kids like grain.  &nbsp;  In the background, the chime of the ice cream van. Jerky notes a fraction off key, hotwiring tongue to brain to desire to need. Mummy mummy can I have some change? Fumbling in pockets for loose coins, over a pound now for a 99 with flake. Mmmm, calippo to push up and crush and drink the icy deposits, strawberry splits with vanilla running into hot palms. Chocolate sauce and chocolate sprinkles, choc-ices leaving brown smears on cheeks and chin, wiped on t-shirts and skirts and shins, fast-melting Twisters. And always the music floating over the roofs, snaking along the thoroughfares, announching an imminent arrival, an indisputable presence. Always on the same route, fading away as it turns into other streets before the triumphant blare of return. Children clutching coins in hand, chattering in pairs,&nbsp;sweating and clinging to eachother in the flushes of an adrenaline high. Blood rushing to their heads as the exertion wears off and limbs tremble, panting for the cool sweetness, sugar craving.  &nbsp;  It trundles into sight, white and blue with the sliding glass window open, old-style microphones creaking out the tune. Sticky-back plastic chart of the products plastered to the side, prices written on and scrubbed out in fat black marker. Sunsets and spangles and stars in design chaos, buy me buy me. And lurking in the back of the van the crowning glory, the machine. All grubby chrome and dirty white handles, trailing turgid drips of cream. Vibrating softly aginst the burr of the engine. Boxes of Cadbury's flakes stacked high, nozzles primed for action. And the heavy hand resting on the pumps as the ice cream man looms into sight, round face&nbsp;beaming as the children stream up to the counter. Handbreak on and out the back in his white apron spotted with sauce. The faces look up, money pushed over the ledge and requests demanded in imperious tones. The line trails the vehicle, children pressing up against the sides to study the menu, choice of thirty lollies, mini-milks to cornettos. But here the 99 is king. He palms the cone delicately, wafer cupped and uncrushed, swamped in rolls of finger. The splutter from the tubes as he pulls levers and twirls and feeds the machine, milking it into delicate curves and loops into the cut-off tip. Crowned with the flake, pushed deep to the root of the cone.  &nbsp;  When I was younger I used to anticipate the arrival of the ice cream van, track its rounds. Ears straining for the sound of the chimes, taut with anxiety if they came too late. And the dreadful disappointment of autumn when he didn't come at all, the long wait of winter and the thrill of the last notes of spring, the first notes tinkling from the speakers, spilling into the still air. I would run to the man with my money hot in my moist palm, thrust them upwards, away. And he'd grin down, teeth white and shiny in his beet face, pores round and gaping and exuding the&nbsp;reek of&nbsp;sweating onions. He didn't smell of sweets and candyfloss, as we imagined, the jovial candyman. We laughed at him behind his back as we revered him to his face. His face rears large in memory, the straight nose and fatty&nbsp;lips, dark black stubble pushing through, visible under the skin of his jaw. I remember his eyes as being small and piggy, but perhaps that was a question of perspective, seen too often from below. His hands were dexterous and strong, wiry hair coiling round the backs of his fingers, palms smooth like the belly of a fish.  &nbsp;  I went to buy a 99 the other day, from a static van parked by the river. Wheels bolted into grips in the road. The price had jumped up, more than doubled, and I went away again. Sometimes when I sit in the garden in the evening I hear the jingle seeping through, the same tuneless song played over and over again as the van trails the streets. I only catch a few bars before it fades into the night and the walls echo emptiness.

      By the time we left that evening we'd gone through two bottle of wine, a litre and a half of vodka, half a bottle of Southern Comfort and half a litre of Tia Maria. Oh, and a few bottles of Sol but we didn't count them.&nbsp;The token man had been drinking them and he was staying behind to nurse his delicate girlfriend. You shall not go to the&nbsp;Ball but up to bed.&nbsp;Perhaps I should have stayed at home after vomiting up a vile mix of Viognier and home-made Black Russian. Fingers down the throat to relieve the nauseous churning in the stomach and clear the head. A trick I hadn't utilised for many many months, perhaps even years. But I led the pack out the door, teetering in my heels along the night roads, tripping across at the traffic lights and onto the bus. Into town. My friends thought I was going on the first bus home again, head wobbling on the stalk of my neck, warbling nonsense words and laughing cigarette-rough throatily. The air perked me up and I took control, radiating decisiveness, ushering and shuffling and herding. Goat not sheep, feet cloven into point toe and spike heel.  &nbsp;  Later in the club I was footloose and fancy free, padding and dancing in bare feet where my shoes had hobbled me, joints bending the wrong way, knock-kneed on the stage. Becks and fag in hand, prancing at the front, dancing with strange men, harassing the DJ to play random retro songs. He told my friend I was very polite but he'd run out of time as I braced myself against a wall to straighten out my back. And the music stopped and the lights came up, highlighting the grime and the heavy hanging faces and red-veined eyes. I had a hotdog from a street vendor outside, the onions caramelised and bitter-sweet, burnt crisp at the edges. Sausage of processed meat hot in my throat, mustard coating my tongue and my chin and my sticky fingers.  &nbsp;  I perched on my seat on the night bus next to my friends, on those seat that face inwards, opposite strangers. My purse (red, Betty Boop monograms) spilled&nbsp;money onto the floor and I leant forward, doubled up, to scrabble at the coins. And when the bus ground to a violent halt I went flying down the aisle, sprawling on my face on the floor. I'd been coerced into my jeans by my nominated clothes guru and had fretted about how low they sat on my hips. And as I struggled on the floor with a good portion of ass on display, prettily adorned with a bright pink g-string, I knew that my fears had firm foundations. For the rest of the journey I couldn't look at my fellow travelers as my friends rocked, wet-eyed with laughter.

      In sickness and in health. Work. Fever, ooh you give me. All through the night. Tossing and turning, cold sweats, hot head swollen and flushed and taut as a pumpkin. Blood-flooded. Sleepless nights, long humid evenings throwing off the damp quilt, plumping the pillow, trying to find cool cotton space to press aginst roasting cheeks. Hair greasy moist at the roots, fringe plastered in strands on sweaty forehead. Arms out above the duvet and drawn back in, retreating, too cold. Shivers up and down the spine, shaking hands and limp wrists. Salt on the tongue from licking dry lips. Lying in the dark, orange-tinged from the glow of the stereo. Chill-out. Focus. The press of stomach against mattress, the swoops of curve from hip to waist to shoulder, the tingling in fingertips pressing down onto shuttered eyelids, shooting bright sparks across the black.   Drowning in sleep. A dream, a nightmare, swimming through viscous dark liquid, effervescent with shimmering light and teeth. Current sucking at feet and thighs and elbows and throat, swirling gritty water into the mouth, pressing between the teeth. Struggling up to consciousness, coughing on the murky banks in the shallows. Thrashing against invisible restraints, paralysed from the neck down and from the chin up. Move head, think of throwing it wildly from side to side. Tendons straining under the jaw. Flutter eyes open, glued tightly shut, lashes meshed. Rolling madly, pupils dim spots under the veined lids. Pulling up towards the light, room flickering in and out of view as the lids hammer down, portcullis protecting and preventing. Pinioned. Flailing arms as the muscles leap like fish into action and movement and life. Gasping breath. Doused in consciousness.

      I went up to Alexandra Palace at the weekend. I didn't even know what it was, really. There was a sport stadium in my mind, wasteland, suburbs, estates. When, in actual fact, it  is  a palace, or a big spa-type building with gaping windows and mellow yellow brick and great halls. And an ice rink. And a TV transmitter aerial. The first ever, my friend said. I said I thought it would be bigger, and I didn't understand why it was now obsolete. It has a plaque, though. British Heritage stamp of approval. We sat in the courtyard of the pub at a wooden table. The beer garden was next to the car park and borrowed somewhat from the latter's atmosphere. A smattering of tables against cold grey surfacing. Not even tarmac. Bleached grey wood, fat grey pigeons, grey clouds pressing down, the grey of the London landscape, panoramic, stretched out before us. I didn't realise how far you could see, how high we'd climbed. Gradual inclines don't tell at the time. The glittering gherkin, thread and dot of the Eye, thrusting pyramid tops of Canary Wharf. St Pauls. We looked out, south and west and east, to the hills on the far side of London murky on the horizon.  I had a pint of Bud, on tap for once. I've never really enjoyed beer, preferring the sharp bite of cold white, but it slipped down nicely. I could do the refreshed 'ah' and wipe the froth from my upper lip. A motorbike arrived in the grounds with its signature grumbling roar, throttle-heavy. It pulled up, sleek against the old walls. I don't know the make, or the model. All I saw was yellow and shiney chrome, much more than the sum of the parts. It pulsated and shone in the weak day, the stifled light gleaming on its curves. An ultimate machine, bordering on the animal, the mythological Beast. The owner swung off and left it, regretfully, casting glances back over his shoulder as he turned the corner by the ice-cream van. We salivated. I wanted to go and stroke it, run my hands over the mud guards, rest my cheek on the grip of the handles, scissor myself into the saddle. A horde of pigeons pecked round its wheels and hyperactive children ran at them, sending them up in clouds of dingy feather and wrinkled claw.

      What is the correct etiquette when you're trapped in a metal box hurtling downwards or groaning upwards, steel wires at full tension? At Covent Garden it's a cattle cart, commuters pressed in like sardines. Florescent lighting and garish posters for cheap 'wild' bars on the walls, designer shops and adverts for London's Transport Museum. And the smooth, plummy vowels of Lloyd Grossman, or some verbal imitator, syrup-thick over the speaker, giving directions to tourists. It drives me to distraction in the morning, as I stumble over the lines in my head, the smugness inherent in the 'I've been paid thousands of punds for this thirty second segment' tone. Half a minute too long. I try to get into the lifts nearest the tube, next to the 160 steps + stairwell. Then it's a polite young woman, warning of pickpockets and telling the crowds to turn left for Neal Street, right for Covent Garden Piazza. People look at the floor and rummage in their bags or turn their eyes up to the ceiling, desperate to avoid the flicker of a shared glance. I tend to stare at hair, stupid fat scrunchies, split ends, bad dye jobs, shining pates, dandruff, thick glossy locks, cutting edge. I spend my lift space examining the backs of heads, where the mirror won't reflect. I smooth my hair with my hand reflexively, combing through with my fingers.  In the company lift it's different. Waist high mirrors make it near-compulsory to make a snap decision. March in, press the number, ringing it in glowing red. Back to the plain wall, bent at the waist to pull at the bags under the eyes, smudge away shadows of speckled mascara. Watching the number ascend. If it stops at another floor, turtling my head back in, retracting. Small grin at the new passengers then looking fixedly at some fascinating spot mid-way on the wall. No pulling back lips to check teeth for food, no poring at red marks and blemishes. No straightening the hair, pulling the fringe down over the forehead and pushing it to the side. A nod and a smile when they leave. Sometimes I stand with my back to the mirror, deliberately avoiding catching my own gaze. It's easy to become enamoured of your reflection. No, perhaps that's wrong. Curious. Watching the way your body handles, the lift of your cheeks when you fake-smile, the way the dim light catches in the furrows as you frown. Where the lines will develop, which is your good side, how your clothes fit. And when the doors swish open with a beep and a 'fourth floor' you sweep out, turning away, leaving a shadow of condensation and form behind.

      Gale force winds in London last night. Flash floods. Five centimetres of rain in five minutes. Five seconds. Umbrellas out in force on the Strand, twisted inside out like broken bat wings in the breeze. Stuck on the top of the 91 it didn't feel like a hurricane. Stuck in traffic, true, trawling through the back streets behind Euston and Kings Cross at a creep. Buses are huge beasts, cars should give way or be crushed. Instead they block the lanes, parking across the red tarmac, glared at by drivers and passengers and barraged by blaring horns. The symphony of long honks and sharp toots and beep-beep-beeeeps, stacatto, and the thumping percussion of hands smacked on steering wheels. The tick of the indicator as the double deckers pull out into reluctant streams of commuters: give way, we have a valuable cargo on board.  The crawl up Caledonian Road. The engine was switched off as the driver ejected a troublemaker, and there was near-mutiny on the upper decks. Fuck's sakes hissed and sighs heaved, restless shifting jostling seat pairs. When I got off at the bus stop on Seven Sisters Road I was gasping for rain-fresh air. Pounding headache from the air pressure hardly soothed from pressing my forehead against the cool, vibrating glass. Pushing past glum passengers waiting for alternate routes and crowding round the doors as they creaked back, jumping on through the exit only when the driver stopped them crushing through at the front. The road was clear as i started to cross, lights green in the distance. And growling white, bright, hurtling towards me as I trotted across. Pausing midstep at the whine of an engine, the rumble of tyres on smoothed surface. It came fast, powerful, as I gaped and dragged my feet round and skipped frantically to the other side. Full throttle, headlamp beam blinding in the heavy grey air. I swear it swerved before it reached me, milliseconds later, sucking up the intervening space like a vacuum. My hair blew in the wind and the empty space of its passage.

      She played with her food, dicing it into equal segments and squashing onto the prongs of the fork. Good, heavy cutlery. She had tried to pick the burger up but the ground meat was too thick and the tomato too slippery and the bun had slid apart in her hands, coating them with a slick of mayonnaise. So, she dissected it, knocked the top cap off. There was a method to it: square of lid and tomato, crumbling bits of beef. Or the lettuce and base and fat wedge of patty crammed together and dumped in the aioli, big bites that gave her chipmunk cheeks as she tried to keep her lips pressed together. Big bites, washed down with an unfamiliar red wine. Her father's choice.  They were discussing the theatre and work and sport and old acquaintances. She was dazzled by the fact he'd known Peter Ackroyd at university and castigated him for losing touch. He snorted and remarked cynically that if he'd known he was going to become extremely famous and rich of course he'd have made more of an effort. They smirked, self-mocking. She became quite impassioned about a poem she'd read, by Neruda, and it was one he was familiar with. When he'd first seen it, a couple of years ago, he'd decided there and then that he would introduce it to his syllabus, make his students take it apart and learn from it. They agreed that it was an incredibly moving piece. Although possibly not for those in the first flush of passion, dealing as it did with lost love and broken dreams.  On the tables around them people gossiped and whispered and cast sly glances. Sugar daddy, ran the undercurrent. Bought company, time for hire. Were they all so scathing? She shrugged her shoulders and the barbs cascaded off her. Partially true at any rate. Couldn't they see the similarities, the straight nose, the cheekbones, the dark lashes framing myopic eyes, the straight hair flopping over our foreheads? True, she was wearing contacts and he had glasses, his chin could be construed as weaker, pulled downwards towards the neck by age and gravity. But they were not unalike, not implausible. People saw what they wanted to see, an older man with his young companion, engrossed in conversation, fingers linked at her throat, throwing her head back laughing.

      Not-so-early morning, rolling out of bed into a wrap and up the stairs. Bathroom full. Totter back down the two flights, stumbling and grumbling, fringe clipped back, face shiney and ready for moisturising. Oil of Olay, brand-whores. Factor 15 for feel-good factor, no lines or wrinkes or crows feet or age spots for me! Oh nonono. Skin plumped up and glowing and peach-fuzz smooth. Going upmarket with the Chanel foundation, more sun protection, barrier layers against the killing sun. Fear of premature ageing might stop the blood in my veins, damp the feather pulse at my wrist. Breathy sigh and a spritz of perfume on stretched neck. Caught in hair, micro-droplets shimmering in the light knifing the curtains. Gold-beige-wheat eyeshadow in work-neutral wear, slick flicks of black liquid liner. The torture-a-like contraptions of eyelash curlers brought up to the eye and crushing and bending. Startle-eyed as a porcelain doll, spiderleg lashes stiff with mascara. Lift and separate, girls! Longer, fatter, luscious lashes.  Wardrobe time and nothing to wear. Rooting through drawers of t-shirts and tops and slips of fabric, heavy denim and unsuitable chiffon. Work it. Work! Sensible jumbers and shirts and pretty-yet-functional tops. Can't have too much flesh on display, swathes of cleavage and flashes of belly, thongs poking out of too-low trousers. The chosen clothes have disappeared, predictably, so it's dusky pink v-neck (autumn/winter wardrobe) and flared black pinstripes. Hot hot hot. And it is warm, outside, the skies are crystalline blue and the sun blazes, burning off the cloud wisps that dance above Safeways. Clopping boots and furrowed brow, sweat-damp by Holloway tube. An uncomfortable bead of sweat nestling uneasy between the cups of the bra. And down the stairs, into the tunnels, feeling the tube-pull air drag through air and cool the neck, face turned to the flare of light along the tracks.  And it was going as well as could be expected, the journey, bum propped on the blue padded cushion that's just a bit too high to properly relax. No seats, of course, but space to read. No crush against the fat back in front, no Metros rustling, tickling chins. And stop. Stop in the blackness between Caledonian Road and King's Cross. Blank sooted walls and the snake of coloured wires. Silence and breathing. The tut of the seasoned commuter, jarred out of the regular sway, arm cricked in the socket. To let go of the bars or hold on, braced against the jolt of movement? And the muffled hilarity and groans of protest as they misjudge and teeter and take overcompensating strides down the aisle. Engrossed in literature waiting for time to pass in the still tomb of the underground. The sleek metal coffin, coughing smoke and fumes and second-hand breath. Spat out at Covent Garden, hauled in dingy lifts and emerging into the light, tagged by the ticket gates with the blue identifiers clasped in hand and slid into bags.

      was that love? it cored me every exhalation tearing the cradle of my ribs an empty basket  i bury my head in the pillow trying to inhale your scent feel the impression of your skull the press of your jaw  my hand is leaden without your grip the space of your arm circling my waist i bend into your embrace and sink boneless  my eyes scald your face sharp every time my lids drop tears leak on my cheeks i taste salt on my tongue  A rather trite poem after a long period of resistance. What can I say? A lazy Saturday afternoon, weekend supplements, the Guardian Review. The Saturday poem, gleaming with splendid simplicity. I can do that. Not better. Who can build on these words, who can challenge another's feelings? I can write from memory and from remembered pain. And current. It's three months now since I've been in love and thrown out of love, heartbroken. But his face floats in front of me when I close my eyes, every night. He's like a tumour I can't excise, although I'm free now and we barely talk anymore. The hurt is vivid and sharp, a knitting needle slid between the ribs, the convulsion of an imagined defibrillator.

      I don't normally smoke in the house but we'd been sitting in the garden for hours and the plastic chairs chilled when we brushed them with our bare skin. He was wearing my red coat from winter, my red riding hood coat with plastic toggles, duffles, which I thought made me look like the twisted dwarf from 'Don't Look Now' from behind. I'd pulled on my grey and pink striped mohair v-neck and the sleeves stretched over my hands, fingers poking out to clutch the slim stem of the wine glass, the smooth tube of packed tobacco. The coat fitted him across narrow shoulders, as he sprawled loose-limbed, a pliable toy soldier. The table was littered with empty bottles, a blue swirled plate, a half-empty tub of taramasalata and the pesto pot crammed full of butts, carefully stubbed and tidied away. Left until morning. In my room we lay on the bed, propped on cushions and elbows, and flicked our ash into an empty vodka bottle. He drank it neat with ice and I glugged warming wine. The Streets on the stereo, candles, window pushed open to let out the worst of the smoke. I was wearing a blue denim shirt dress that gaped, unbuttoned nearly to bra depth. He was the fourth person that day to comment on how much he liked it. Strange that, when you have something for years and it suddenly comes into its own. Time and place, here and now.  After the sex we lay together, enforced intimacy but comfortable. Comforting. The music was on loop and we listened to the lyrics, laughing and nodding in comprehension, recognising the scenes and words that twisted and shifted, familiar images. Talking nonsense, talking sense. Touching close, thigh on thigh, arm round back and waist, hand resting on breast, head on chest tilted up to look at the face. Spoken breath on cheek. More sex, easing into it. Sex and speech, the tangled dialogue. I got up to turn the sound down, blow out the candles, fetch a jug of water. We rambled on, wrapped in and round eachother. Sentences breaking down into nothing, fragmented words. I drifted into sleep and woke up mid-sentence I couldn't remember.
