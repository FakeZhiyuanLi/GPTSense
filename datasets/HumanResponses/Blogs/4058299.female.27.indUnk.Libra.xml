      Today is the celebration of my Mama's 46th bday (bata noh!) and Nanay (bernard's mom) will visit our house and will bring kare-kare (yum-yum).  Technically parang pamamanhikan na rin, We never made it "that formal" to avoid any uneasiness, parehong shy type ang mga parents namin.  Additional food are grilled fish, I also cooked my specialty na "herb pasta", my sister and bayaw contributed some cake and blueberry ice cream.  Super nice ang feeling, kasi our parents are getting along and are having fun-fun-fun.  Ready at excited na sila sa aming wedding heheheh.  Happy Birthday Mama! we love you.

      Why   fruits   because it's signify ABUNDANCE, as for the   flowers   hmmm huag na lang kaya heheh... sign of FERTILITY kasi eto he he he at hindi muna.....will enjoy muna our time as husband and wife only..... for 1 or 2 years.  I have decided na to choose fruits na mabango at yung hindi bilog *winks* para di masiadong pricey. Also to buy scented candles, siguro i'll get apple scents.  Bernard is very supportive naman on my ideas at super enjoy din sia .... sobrang nakakatuwa mag prepare at super excited kaming gawin together. =) (lab u daleng!)  You can visit our website and check on the  urlLink details  kasi nakagawa na kmi ng 'save the date card' (kyut).

      'Em having a hard time thingking of ideas on how to incorporate&nbsp;my choosen theme on our invites, favors, and reception set-up, etc.... so I consulted my fellow  urlLink w@wies  and wallahhh:   Favors - pdeng fruit basket or&nbsp;scented candles, or fruit jams  Reception set-up -&nbsp;fruits and flowers centerpiece  Cake - cupcake na hugis fruits (cake na... give aways pa!)  Invites -&nbsp;with fruits and flowers love qoutes and poem etc.   Galing talaga&nbsp;ng mga sisters ko noh! But&nbsp;fruits are very expensive sa wedding date namin so I&nbsp;should think pa some other altenatives or kahit touches or fruits and flowers na lang ang theme.   Siempre react ang aking konsensia na si Bernard at always reminding me about the "nice to haves' and the 'must haves'.   &nbsp;

       Went to alabang town center last night to attend novena. After the mass&nbsp;I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;my usual window shopin and pass by 'cereo' candle exchange, i'm lookin kasi for a perfect unity candle.    &nbsp;  So happy...&nbsp;coz the candles on display fits my&nbsp;motif&nbsp;yeyyy!   kala ko kasi before laging ganun ang color ng mga candles nila.    &nbsp;  talked to the sales girl and she's very accomodating ha,&nbsp;they do custom-made on a specific colors pala and same price lang din nung display nila....just&nbsp;place an&nbsp;order and give them some swatches of the colors&nbsp;you want. Medyo pricey nga lang sila...   I should order daw sa November na at baka mag fade pa yung colors (katuwa honest ung girl ..sana lahat ng supplier's ganito ka honest).    &nbsp; Another option ko si 'liwanag candles' pero need to go pa all the way to malabon and search for their place hmmm ... mas mura kasi sila heheheh. isep-isep.

       Been so busy at work for the past weeks and now really suffering from stressed and frustrations hopin to get this wedding preps overrrr! and have a normal life again.      So many things has to be done pa and ang dami pa namin kulang,   well... I do this on purpose naman I don't want to commit mistakes 'again' on choosing good supplier's.      Besides , Im also waiting for the comming 'Bridal Fairs' heard that I can have a really good deals, freebies, discounts with the exhibitors and to add were also saving money pa *winks*.  Dear Lord, thank you for testing our patience, teaching us to be stronger and tolerate unlikely circumstance. *sisiw* =)  (Our pet Berrie gave birth to five cutie-winnie pups... yahoo!)
