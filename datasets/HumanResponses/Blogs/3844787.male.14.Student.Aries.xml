      Well the past few days have been very active for me, yesterday, I went too my nans house with my brothers girlfriend, and did the gardening for them, which was... interesting, then we went home, I sat on the computer then I was beckoned by my mum, so I lay outside on the hammock, and my uncle phoned, so me and my dad went fishing with him. We went too a place called Broad Acre's, where I saw some of my school mates there, which was nice too say hello, so we chatted, and they left, then I started my fishing, all night I was catching 6 poundish fish, so after we went too the pub too celebrate.  Today, I woke up and did some chores, and went on the PC, few phone calls, Dad came home for a bit, I went too the shop, then I came home and went on the PC for about ten minutes and I went too McDonalds with my mum and went too my aunties house and then went shopping, because my auntie was in Hospital really sick. Then We came home, and watched School of Rock, which was a wicked film, so that was a good day. Umm... no.... i'll report here tomorrow, maybe late because i'm working on a building site. How fun!!

      I'm going too start my new graphics website tonight, I'm going too try and make it look as professional as I can, but I'm not sure what too do the design like, Its going too Include my Wallpapers, Avatars, Signatures, Posters and logos that I have made for people and for myself, its going too be sort of like a portfolio about my work.    If anybody wants any graphics done then email me: " urlLink traxor@gmail.com ".  Even only if you need me too do a small bit of editing, I am willing to do it for you, as you may have read, the holidays are boring as hell, so it gives me something to do that I enjoy doing a lot!    The skarz site is finished!! Finally after about 8 Hours work on the template etc. I have completed the site!! Its really good, well at least I think so, we have around 25 people in skarz though, so I apologise for the lack of all of the Profiles, They will definitely be up on the site as soon as I can get them up, even if I don't have the Picture yet, I will put them up.      I wrote a poem last night when I should've been sleeping, after reading some of my new book, I decided too lye down and write a poem, but its really lame, so i'm not even going to dare post it, as it will just lead too me being shy and embarassed when the person who its to reads it, but I think that she'll make me tell it her anyway, which will make me shy, which  sucks!!!

      Well, as you may know, i'm not enjoying the holidays at all, I can't wait just too go outside too the shop or something, its not enjoyable sat inside all day, its the most boring thing that you can do, my Computer is no longer an amusement too me. So there is nothing I can do.    Yesterday, I didn't have any lunch or dinner, so in the end I had a chicken sandwich at 11pm, I actually did go too Tesco's too buy a pot noodle, but instead came back with some adidas Eau De Toilette, hair gel and a book called 'The Curious incident of the Dog in the night time', so far its quite a good book, its about a boy with Asperger's disease who find's a dog in the morning with a fork through its chest, and he becomes a detective trying too find out who killed it. Its a sort of muder mystery novel, its quite interesting.     Anyways, I might buy a pot noodle.

      Today has been the most boring day of all the holiday! I woke up at 12, and went on the computer, at 2:30, i went and watched a program about immigrants, then at 3, i went and got dressed and came back onto the computer. And all day, i've just ate, drank and spoke to people I don't even know very well. Its absolutely rubbish!!    Later on, I should get really far on Legacy of Kain: Defiance and then watch the end of return of the king.and sleep.

      Well, i'm happy now!!! At last, yesterday I was really depressed for some reason, about an old ex-girlfriend that i really miss! Anyway, thats in the past! Last night I got home from a party and stayed up all night on msn!! It was a great laugh, i spoke too people like Wacky and Marissa :p hehe!!    Today, I just basically went too Bourton on the Water, and we went and had a meal then went to 'Birdland', i had an interesting paddle in the river! It was brilliant, in birdland, i actually started screaming like a monkey at some parrots, they seemed too enjoy it!! Then further around, i saw a cockatoo that was on its own in the cage, and was trying too get attention by nodding up and down, but it sounded really lonely, so we stroked it!! Then of course, we had the interesting journey home! With my impressions and things! This brings me too here, where I am on the PC doing my blog (mr. hypocritical).     I'm off for now, I'll write here tomorrow!

      Due to James now leaving, I had a lot of time too do my skarz site, so I just added the last finishing touches and began too get into the swing of things, i've completed the site now, all i need too do&nbsp;is add pictures and movie and keep people updated on how the dvd is coming on!!   Anyways back too business, well, i enjeyed having James around, other than the fact that i got him banned from Msgplus!! I found it quite amusing this morning. Last night we went too my aunties house and stood in a shop reading Magazines, until of course we went to&nbsp;Tesco's with my parents for some reason, so we had&nbsp;a lot of fun with trolleys, electric wheel chairs and freezers, its better than it sounds, although i stood on my jeans and now there is a rip up the back of its right trouser leg, which means i need too spend more money on clothes!! How interesting! So we spent all night on the PC and at 12:30am, we went into my lounge and watch starsky and hutch!!! It was quite a good film.   This morning we woke up, James was turning the tv on!! The bastard.. he woke me up! Then we went on the pc for 10 minutes and he went downstairs and turned on 'xXx', so we watched that for an hour and 40 minutes, then of course, I went on the PC, and i looked out of my window at him skating, it was quite amusing throwing stuff at him while he was ollying around on my patio!   Hopefully, I should be getting one new game a week, unless of course i need too save my money for such luxury's as CLOTHES!!! I'm not quite sure why i got a blog, i've been branded hippocritica by some people, but who can blame them! After all, i am the one that said I hated them!! Look !!!! You can see how lame I am! urlLink http://msgplus.mybboard.com/showthread.php?tid=28725&amp;page=1 &nbsp;!! How strange! I'm not sure why i changed my opinion on blogs so fast! Its just wierd i suppose!   Anyway, I'm out, see you!

      James is coming over tonight, so I might not update anything, at the moment i'm just waiting for Paul too stop playing on my game I brought yesterday 'Colin McCrae 3'!! All i want too do is to go into my own room and get dressed! But he's in there, playing on my new game! Its been raining outside for hours, its just annoying, it means i can't even skate! I might in a bit though, I even left my skateboard outside in the rain last night!&nbsp;So its drenched and getting weaker, which now means&nbsp;I have too wait too buy a new deck if i skate this one too hard! It sucks! It really does...&nbsp;  More and more people are going on too the skarz site, which means i might be giving up on my old openmind site, this is just so i can concentrate more on the skarz site and hanging out with my freinds, with all of the people going on my site, i'm going too get a hitcounter today, but i'm not sure where i can get a good one from! Its really hard too find things on the web now, its annoying, I can do it, but i just get frustrated so easily!   What I might do is to just start building up my skarz site as best as I can, it already looks quite proffessional, but I want it as best as I can, I have this standard that I always want too reach, I see peoples sites and think how amazing they are, this inspires me a great deal, so I try and learn, like now I have MX Studio, because I want too learn flash, I want too learn flash because i've seen sites like  urlLink http://www.shadyskinning.com .&nbsp;I just like the proffesional look these sites have.  I can't explain the way i feel about this world today, i love it and i hate it, the hate that is revolving around the globe is enormous, but where there is hate, there is also love, i'm beginning too think that hate is just a balance, something that god has put on earth too balance out everything, stuff always comes in twos....  Have I figured out the meaning of life??? Its strange, I realised, that the only certain thing in life... is death, is this the true meaning of life, too die? If it is, then I guess that I just made a fact!

      Well life for me isn't that good, my family is wicked yeah, but its the people in my village that I hate, there are people who are after me because they hit me and broke my nose! Its just dumb! All i'm doing is either skating, playing guitar, sitting on the pc or playing on my xbox, I need too go outside, I feel restricted as if there is a barrier outside my door!  I only feel good when i'm doing skarz, i'm not sure why, its just the feeling that I get as the adrenaline pumps through my blood when I do something outrageous, it feels good, i'm not sure how too explain the feeling, its just like a rush, a 'natural high', its the feeling you get when you land a trick for the first time on a skateboard, or complete something you've been attempting too do for a while.   I got banned from the MSGPlus! Community forums a week ago, and they should have unbanned me by now, so now I sit and wait for them too unban me, it's like torture! Why can't they unban me! Its annoying, i'm not sure what they did, why can't they email me, explaining what i've done wrong, its as if they don't care that i'm supporting Patchou's work on his great extension.   I traded in my Gameboy Advance, Azurik: the rise of perathia and Minority report today, I exchanged them for Need for Speed: Underground, Colin McCrae Rally 3 and Legacy of Kain - Defiance. So for i have done quite a few races on need for speed and have a nice looking Honda Civic, i'm just waiting too trade for a Nissan Skyline (my dream car)!!! On Legacy of Kain i'm stuck on a part where i have to race too the top of the room before some mist rises and engulfs me, i can't seem to get up high enough and keep falling. On colin mccrae, i just can't seem too get the controls right! I'll figure it out one day!  I now know the official release date for Halo 2, and its not changing, it was told at E3! Ladies and Gentleman, the game of the decade will be out on November the 9th! I know this because i brought the official xbox magazine, and on the 12 minute video of Halo 2, the man had it tattood on his arm!!! It was crazy!!  I'm getting more publicity off the net now, so i'm getting happier and happier, Messenger Milk is going well for JWB and he's doing really well, who knows, he might be the new patchou!

      I got rid of wallpapers off of my site, I felt that there was no significance for wallpapers, nobody would download them anyway, so I just felt that it was a waste of space. Instead of wallpapers on the links page, i've replaced it with a link directly too this weblog, as I feel that people knowing things is more relevant than something I made in Photoshop in 5 Minutes! I'd rather express how I feel through texts rather than some abstract form of digital photos!  I think that this is all I need to say, so I'll post back in here tomorrow! Until then Peace out

      These past few weeks, we've been starting too get some decent footage, and with the new site up, we now have more publicity, and simon is getting much better at editing his footage. You must understand though, that these short snippits of film do not show the finished work, it is merely a sneak preview of behind the scenes at skarz!  Luke is starting too trust himself more with a skateboard, so now you will start too see better tricks and bigger things, such as high ledges and long sets, hopefully he should be learning to flip some sets pretty soon. We now have&nbsp;some new skaters on the team, these are James O'Brien and Lee Quirke, we are trying too get as many skaters as possible, we may even be starting a bmx section to the dvd, but we're a bit sceptical as too whether this will go down well.   As you may well know, it is the summer holidays here in the U.K. So we should be getting much more footage, and the DVD will be up for sale before october, the only real problem is, the way we're going to get the postage sorted out, we may even have too set up a PO BOX or something, but that costs, so i might be setting up a paypal account, all donations are welcome and needed!   If you have any suggestions or comments post it in the comments area in here! Thankyou!   Signed, Luke

      Well, my last four days have been alright I suppose, i've always been with my mates, since the last time I wrote in this blog, I have watched shit loads of the flash movies and played the games on albino black sheep, unknown geek and newgrounds. But i'll tell you what i've actually done.  On Monday night, I stayed at Simon's house, and we just pissed about in his outhouse where we slept, and watched peter kay, and played on the ps2 and xbox. After this we had a load of fun with a board marker, drawing eyes and stuff around my nipples, I know it sounds wierd, but I had a face on my chest, so I was happy! Just joking, I was annoyed that I forgot about it and when into their houes topless, the Mum was in hysterics, so I went into the dvd cupboard, and got cd's, which doesn't make sence, but these cd's were all sixties cd's!!  After this, we went back to the outhouse (with drinks and food) and turned on the rotating discoball that hangs from the ceiling, this was quite fun! During this we rang a load of people and I put on a voice and told them I loved them and stuff, it was one of those weird things that happens,  PRANK CALLS!   One main thing that we did that night was drink 22 cans of coke and stack them on top of each other so they went all the way to the ceiling, it was cool!  The day after, Sam came back to my house, and we watched dvd's and played on the xbox, HOW INTERESTING! He stayed the night, and we went on his electric scooter and things which was pretty cool, as it goes around 25mph! It was interesting......  The next day, I slept at Sams house, and that brings us to here, after a night full of the pc, and no  MESSENGER PLUS FORUMS!!! IT WAS MURDER!!!

      Wellllll, as some of you may know, I had another interesting all-nighter with the likes of Marissa, it was very interesting, found out some stuff that I didn't know, and told people some stuff that they didn't know, its was great! I stayed up waiting for my  mate to come round, and the bastard came round to late!!!! (He gave me a funny look, then called me a 'Paed' cause I made a typo!!)  Then we went on the PC, went on the ps2 and i fell asleep for two hours, ate my dinner, then we went to the shop, bought red bull!!!! And we're here...  This rules!

      This weekend I just sort of went too St. Ives in Cornwall, the 4 hour journey there is always boring, but when we get there we usually go to the pub, which is nice. We stayed at a Bed and Breakfast at the top of the town, unfortunately, there was no room in the place where we usually stayed hence the fact that I slept on the sofa, but I didn't mind, as it was absolutely huge!!  In the morning of Friday, my dad bought me some 'bomb's' from a small shop which sells a lot of stuff, they're not actually bombs, its just a bag with a small bag of vinegar inside it an then powder in the larger bag, and when the vinegar reacts with the baking soda, the gases cause the bag to explode very very loudly. So I sneakily placed a lot of them around town, while me and my dad were amused as people leapt in the air, it was very amusing!!!  On the second day of being there, my Dad bought me a Karma deck, it is very nice 7.5" Round Logo deck. I haven't skated it properly yet, but that is soon to change, the deck is like a feather its loverly to skate, but the best of all, its strong! Unfortunately after this, the forecast was a Tropical Storm, it was quite bad, but not as bed as they said, it was just very strong winds and a lot of rain. Later that day, we left and went on a 5 hour journey home, it should've in theory been 3 hours, but NO, the guy in the sky had to shit on us again, aww well, he still rocks!!!

      Well today, I just did the usual, woke up and went on the pc, after throwing stuff on my sleeping friend of course, as you do. Then at 1:30, we started to walk to Redditch Alex Hospital, this was full of tails from me my, brother and Josh  talking about fights,  which was real interesting i suppose. When we got too the hospital, we sat in the waiting room, then I went in too my appointment, and there was this random person, staring at us for about ten minutes (he was about 13), so my mate stared bag, and this kid started to grit his teeth at us, then he did it too me and I burst out laughing, which made this kid smile, then this kid lent down and started too look up my mates shorts, so we took the piss, and like did gay jokes, like lisp's, the wierd hand thing and put our legs up on the chair and winking, then he got pissed off and went into his appointment.  After this, we waited outside, got on the bus and the bloke let us off the bus fair, which was wicked of him, then we went into Redditch town centre, and my mate bought a game called Shocking Rulette, we played this while eating mcdonalds!! What you have to do, is put your finger in a little hole, and then you press a button, a light spins around, and you wait, and you have too try and keep a straight face whoever is shocked, and if you don't you're out. Its wicked, and the schock is just irritating, not really bad!!  After this, I went and bought a fake moustache, and walked around with this realistic Moustache on, it looked as if people wanted too look at me, but they didn't want too, because they thought I had a disease or something! It was funny, then I went into a shop asking for shaving foam, and the people behind the counter and people in the shop burst out laughing at me, I just evilled them.  After this, I went down the wrong escalator, and the Security Guard Chased me, and then he had a go at me, and I was like, "OK!!! I have a moustache!!" Then we left, unfortunately for my friend Josh, a load of townies are after him because he helped my other friend in a fight, and on the bus were none other than some of the alcester crew, so we had too take a load of high pitched verbal abuse from them, and might I add, is "I fucked your mum" the best that they can come up with, its just really lame.......  Because of this, we got off at the hospital and walked home! It was great, more talk about fighting, so I bought a drink and a magazine, and we walked through the Recreation Ground, where the kid who broke my nose and his mates were, but I kept a straight face, so we went back later, and Chris, the person who broke my nose, wouldn't even look at me, and when he did, he looked away straight away, so I don't think that i'll get anymore shit off of them anymore, so I'm happy now, anyway, I'm off...

      I've had such a good weekend, so good in fact, that I haven't even had too fill in my blog!!! Its been wicked, Saturday morning I went too work and concreted a load of floor, then made it level. This took about 2 hours, and I got paid £10, so i'm happy!  When me and my Dad got home. we went too Redditch with my mum, we walked around, I got some guitar strings, and we went for a meal. After this, we walked around a bit more, had a fuck off ice cream and left. On the way home, my mum started too whisper too my dad, and we went too my aunt and uncles! After there, me and my bro got in the car, and m ymum and dad drove all the way back too the shopping centre, and me and my bro waited in the car for ages and ages, and then the elevator opened, and my dad was there with a guitar. My parents bought me a brand new electro-acoustic guitar, and a hard case, so I was stoked.  The next day, I woke up we went too stratford and picked up my mate, (he's in bed at the moment) and then  me and my  mate skated around Safeway for a bit, then we went in, I brought 2 DVD racks, and some sandwiches, then we met up with my parents and left.  Thats about it really, and today i'm going too Redditch. Peace Out :)
