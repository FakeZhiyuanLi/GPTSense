      mecredi 10 decembre  I took french for three years and scored a five on the IB Standard level exam so i might as well make use of some of it some where other than aspire to go to france one day . . which i will. btw. who am i and what am i doing? this type of philosophial question would probably make a normal person go mad. its a good thing i'm not a normal person. lets, see, who am i and what am i doing? other than i have an english paper for english on native son and its ability to great great disquietude and pleasure, and tons of other papers to write . . .i'm also looking to get into UC Davis or Berekely. I'm not sure what i want to major in, other than i do have an interest in computers (designing and developing websites, soon will have a server too . . .)   and english (i've just read hemingway on recommendatoin from a bookworm friend, hemingways actually pretty good, i like his short stories, but then i prefer oscar wilde's short stories over hemingways). . . .and chemistry ( i worked with andrei at uc davis's material sciences dept using calorimeters to study silver thiolates). . . . . .i should probably apply to some liberal arts private colleges . . . i've finished my UC applications . . am waiting in earnest. . . . what am i doing in addition? agonizing over why the hell did i fall in love? poets think that love isn't love without one having gone through the "threshing floor" of love, and i geuss. . .thats partly true . . . . . .i hope j will still love me even after all the finals are over. long distance love is a new thing . . .it hurts though sometimes. . . . i don't remember why i gave myself to j . . .it seemed like the thing to do at the time. . . i keep telling myself that i don;t regret it . .and in a way i don't . . .i just miss him terribly . . . .  also met p for coffee. i need to do more of that . .meet up with old friends and just hang out . . .with k too . . . . i need to im him sometime . . i hope things aren;t so awkward between us anymore . . .hmmm. . . .for some reason . . .i'd rather have guy friends than girl friends. . .guys are just fun to be around . .theres always that sense of attraction that constantly in the air. . . . .

      New Statistics: IBO (http://www.ibo.org,they use cold fusion to program their site , , ,soooo cool!) said that this year, out of 24,000 students who went for the IB Diploma worldwide, 20,000 got it. I was part of that 20,000, and 18 of 36 of those who went for it at my school/.  .. .Well, that was fun . .

      Yaaay! I go the IB Diploma!!! Yes, my scores weren't that high, 29 points total, but the highlight include the fact that I did after all get it, (I'm not sure how many people in the program did) my extended essay was one of the higher scoring ones (damn straight, it better be, . . .spent a whole summer at davis working on it) and that I am officially now one of the hundreds around the world who gots it.  :) well,i feel special :). 5 in English Higher Level, 5 in History HL , 4 in Math Methods 2 Standard Level, 4 in Art HL, 5 in Art SL, 4 in Chemistry HL. Looking back on all this though, I'm just looking forward to college, two more months!!!! in the meanwhile i get to indulge in the sweets of computers . ..

      Just Reminiscing . . .  "Tommorrow will be better, we're staying at the Crowne Plaza". I looked up at you, and moved around the room, turning back around brought me into your arms, into you .. .at the airport I was nervous . . . you pushed me against the car, peered into my face and brought yourself against me, firmly pressing my waist against the car. . . driving, your fingers rans over my thighs as I sat next to you and felt a quick rush of heat spreading through my body . . . In my mind I remembered what I told you during our conversations, about how I wanted you inside me even before we reached to hotel . . .you were testing me, seeing how far i was willing to go . . .  I felt you growing hard against me . . .I brought you to my lips and tasted you and I heard you whisper that you were waiting for months to see what it felt like.. . .I panicked when you prodded youself into me, gently, slowly, testing . . . looking expectantly into my face . . ." I . .just wanted to see . . what it felt like . .for a moment," you panted when fear overtook me and I pulled myself away from under you, pulling you out, away from that dizzy feeling . . .I screamed and screamed with each time you went inside me, it took some more time before my screams became moans, begging you for more . . .the white sheets folded and crinkled around us as I turned over giggling and you chased after me through the cool sheets, and night air, tickling me, with teasing words and hands . . . . . . .

      Sunday, March 07, 2004   I once told D that I had three sisters . . she told me that thats was cool, esp. b/c its like we're like the three vietnamese princesss. i think she was talking about a vietnamese fairy tale, which i have still yet to look up . . .will do so soon. i drove all the way to vacaville, and then to sacramento to help my second olderst sister to get her new car . . aghhh! and you know what? i'm going to be an aunt again . . . . .thats three nieces up to date, not to mention a nephew too from my oldest sister. whats going on here? ah well . . . in all honesty i love my sisters . . hmmm lets see . . . .memories i have of them . . .well, there was that time when we took turs swing eachother in a hammock, and that time we went to the park and took pics . . . .that was fun . . . . and gosh were we ever stoopid :) we played war with stuffed animals :) and then thattime when we went to this small playground with one of those tire swings. . . .ahh nostalgia.   I have found a new love of louie armstrong's music. (its sooo cool!) Now to get to those ballroom dancing lessons  so i can learn how to swing dance properly ::grin:: Group Four project turned out to be not soo bad afterall :)   we got some help from UOP, and we finally have our results (yaay!). I've got to admit, it was actually pretty interesting, at times stressful, but worth it. It was fun digging up those yellow mustard plants, it felt like gardening, and i loved the weather too :).  Soo many things to do still . .of course . . .for example, my world lit 2  paper . . .gosh .  . . . not to mention that Tok paper . . . .
