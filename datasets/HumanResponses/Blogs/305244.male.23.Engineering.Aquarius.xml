       The old Nmap::Parser::XML module is now updated as Nmap::Parser for the perl namepspace. It includes various changes (see documentation). To update any of your old scripts to using the new core parser, just replace the 'use' call from 'use Nmap::Parser::XML' to 'use Nmap::Parser'. All the functionality should be the same. Nmap::Parser::XML has been included in the distribution of 0.76 as a transition module (it will be deprecated in the future).  &nbsp; On another note - its my birthday! (23yrs)

       The methods tcp_service_product and udp_service_product are implemented in the parser and are fully tested by the scripts. They have not been documented in the POD. This documentation bug is fixed.

       I have made it easier for myself to keep up-to-date with updating the project webpage. I was also tired of the old format, so I switched it up a bit and I find it a little more cleaner and eye-catching.

       Due to the recent news that Nmap 3.55 has been released with new MAC and wireless information resources - I will start updating the parser for the new release. This will not be done until after August 20th, 2004.

      Always remember to work with lows and highs. Snaps too.  On the slide: when you are are going to do the slide - jump it. Move shoulders and when doing basic rotate shoulders backwards (when going forward, rotate left shoulder backward, -- when going back rotate right shoulder backward).   hand throw - after doing a crossover with a turn from a hammer lock position, switch hands while she's not facing you and fling the hand, and recover it back.  Do double spins. Stand proud.  Bellyup: From a regular 2-hand hold position, the man turns himself half way with hands connected and places the hand on his shoulder. (So now the guy and girl are facing the same direction) - this becomes a hand drop move, except the guy does the basic forward and moves a little to the side and using his left hand, asks for the other womans hand (both still facing the same direciton). Then this leads into a cross body lead.  From David S. Lead a right turn (using your right hand and her left hand) - man does half a right turn and does a reversal turn for the ladies. From a hammerlock - open break and spin her into a cuddle position - then snap her back 1,2,3 and lead a crossbody lead from there. The snap is an illusion that she really is moving the front foot forward more than the back foot.  From Juan C. From regular 2-hand hold, women turn with both hands connected which now become crossed. (right turn). This leads to an open break into the 'rainbow' (similar to john's move) (hands go up and draw out a semi cirlce in the air). To do this move correctly the man pulls using his left hand. Aftger this man and woman are facing opposite directions, but are back to back. Then man pulls right, then pulls left for the women while he keeps going right. Picks up the lady's left hand with his left hand, (facing oppotite perpendicular directions) open breaks, the lady goes staright through, man switches hands behind his back, (flings it) grabs the ladies stretched out arm with his right hand, and pulls to turn her and switches his hands again which makes the woman wrap herself up (into a cuddle position) but the guy is facing the other way.   From Steve M. Open break to a titanic. then the guys go into a similar titanic but not stretched. Fixes his left arm, does a reversal turn (both facing the same way, he looks back and leads a right turn). Then faces back to his partner which should be in the hammerlock position - lead a crossbody lead with turn, but on 7, stop her, twist her for 1, 2, and on three, you let her freespin. Snap-twist.

      Things learned last night:  Double front tap Suzy-Q+  New Footwork with lookback   Move: Crossbody lead, except with stops and twists on 1, 3, and 5. Take hands - low on 1, med-hi on 3, and very low on 5, to then do the crossbody lead with turn. After that open break, and as she's coming towards you, you remain facing the same direction, switch righthand for the left hand and make her turn behind your back (left hand over your head, ending to your side). Switch hands behind your back, fling hand to her right on 3, catch the left on 5 and spin her the other way. Then from a hammerlock position, do an open break (still in hammerlock position), and give her spins into a cuddle position. Use elbow to push ther through the hole on 7-8, and go back to basic and spin her on 5 6 7.

      From one of my lessons:&nbsp;   Its not about knowing combos, its about smoothness and execution. You really only need 4 -5 moves for a dance, and if you can execute those moves smoothly, you'll be thought of a great dancer. It doesn't matter if you know 2000 combos, if you do them all sloppily.   Also:   Drills:  1. do basics (regular, enchufe and guauanco) by clapping on 2 and 6.  2. do basics (regular, enchufe and guauanco) by clapping on&nbsp;4 and 8.  3. do basics (regular, enchufe and guauanco) by clapping on&nbsp;1,3,5,7.  Try doing this while doing a more complicated move.   For turning - stay in place - rotate upper body keeping a frame, and do a turn which you should land in the same place that you originally were.   &nbsp;

      Some new terms I learned while taking some classes: &nbsp; Basic - same as the front-and-back basic Guagua  nco - is the side-to-side break Enchufe - is also known as the back-to-back basic "Suzy-Q" - is a cross-over with the legs while moving to the side &nbsp; This is the website of the people I'm taking classes from:  urlLink http://www.salsasandiego.net/new/default.asp?q=classes  &nbsp; I like their layout and updated information in finding clubs to go dancing or lessons.

      I've gone out Salsa dancing and its been fun. Learned A LOT of ladies styling, new footwork, new moves, new methodologies in teaching andphilosophies. One main thing I learned is something called 'CasinoRueda' which is the Cuban version (supposedly) of salsa rueda which isthe actual one seen in Dance With Me, and (rumors) in Shall We Dance. Anyway, its a lot of fun, and I think you guys will enjoy it when I get back to teach it.   Here are the basic moves so far: Al Centro - step inside the circle and out Pa' Bajo - ladies to an back to back, while guys do a side to side Conchita - complicated dame Dile Que No - Like a dame Dame una buya - 'give me a shout out' &nbsp; there were other moves but I can't currently remember.

      Instead of giving away free CD in raffles, we can give buy freedownloads from I-Tunes (Apple downloading software legally at .99c asong). So instead of paying 15 bucks for a raffle, we can have anI-TUNES gift card as a raffle, which is cheaper (5 bucks, for 5songs). This means we are promoting people listening to salsa.This also means we can make our own Descarga Compilation Cd,s and sellthem for like 10 bucks (6 songs), which means we make 4 bucks forevery Cd sold to our members. It is all LEGAL thanks to i-tunes.Please reveiw the information on: www.itunes.com . This will give us another source of income toDescarga. We can have different flavors of Descarga Cd - Anthony's,Geoff's and John's - and we can setup paypal for people to purchasethe Cd's through our website.  www.paypal.com THIS IS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT TELL OUR COMPETITION ABOUT THIS IDEA!!

      Hey team (executive) - August is almost here. Ok, due to the idea stealing of some people, I have created a listcalled  urlLink 'descarga-exec@iastate.edu'  which goes in effect tomorrow andonly you two (Todd and Violeta) and I are in it. All informationcontained in emails sent to descarga-exec will remain CONFIDENTIALmaterial, example ideas that we want to take advantage of and not letsome other members, cabinet members (example john) know about. And ofcourse, for example if we tell Mei, and we don't tell john, then johnwill find out through mei... this is just one example. Anyway - here are some things we must start thinking about and I'mjust listing them here and I will take care of their execution.%=====================Meeting between descarga-exec members ONLY at the beginning of semester. Descarga 04-05 Budget - I want to pay our cabinet members a certainpercentage from our net revenue , we need to come up with a financialmodel for this. GSB FUNDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Trips to Des Moines - $$ Express Lessons for Engineer Ball couples - I was thinking aboutcharging 20 bucks a couple of the lessons (for those who want goodsalsa lessons before the engineer's ball - It hink we can make akilling of of this). We need marketing for this. Descarga Dance Lesson ScheduleI have a new idea of descarga cards from what I've seen here in SanDiego. Small visa card like cards (just the size) with circles thatget punched when people come to lessons. Dance Shoes and Clothing - not make it ourselves, but see who wouldsponsor us, give us discounts for helping send people to their stores- maybe get a comission or get discounts for our members. Fall Club Fest preparation - bulleting boards, flyers..etc. We need tomarket for more cabinet members. We are more than just dancing and weneed more people for our growth. We are becoming more of anentertainment club than just dance. Descarga Webpage upgrade - I will try and do this when I get back - Idon't have a computer right now. Descarga Re-organization, place people in the right seats on the right bus. Descarga new vision and strategy. outside bank account - We have to get a external bank account and Idon't care if it is in my name - we can have a check card to use forour purchases, and maybe get rewards (cash back) for using the card. Rising costs of teaching - we are too cheap. I was doing some numbercrunching and I think we should raise our single lesson price to $5dollars (instead of $3 which would influence people to become moremembers than jsut come and go). And raising membership costs to 30 (wecan talk about this one since it can affect us the most). Anyway, this is ALL CONFIDENTIAL material - please do not let it getout of the execs. Thanks,

      If you can't do a move correctly slow, then you sure cannot do it right fast. If you can't control a car going 10 mph right, how can you control it when you are doing it at 100mph?
