      the plan was......  to apply.  i went to the bookstore and bought John Douglas's  urlLink Guide to Police Officer Exams .    Douglas's book went over salary expectations, departmental obstacles, goals, and juristidictions, how a police department is organized, and what to expect on the written exam, physical exam, interview, background investigation, psychological evaluation, and polygraph.    i started my search over the internet.  how much are police officers making these day?  what areas did i want to apply to?  what do i have to do?  did i meet the criteria?    for the majority of police departments, the minimal educational requirement is a high school diploma or the equivalent, a GED.  the age requirement is usually somewhere between 20-21 years of age.  the police population is male dominated, but the female population is on the rise, and no, females are not given special treatment when it comes to the physical agilities test (which in my opinion, is good).    a good traffic record and a lack of drug history and bizarre sexual history is GOOD.  the opposite + a criminal history = bad.  of course, should you have a drug history, telling the truth is the most important, and as long as it isn't a part of your current lifestyle, you're okay.  some departments require that you be clean for atleast X amount of years before applying to become a police recruit.  sometimes they even specify which drug and the years which you must be clean varies.  some departments just care if you come clean and admit, "yes yes, i did it once, and yes, i did inhale."

      the purpose of this blog is to create some kind of ... well, blog recording the little hurdles i've had to jump in order to become an officer of law enforcement.  (which i have yet still to become.  yes, the title is premature.)  besides, it's the journey that matters most, right?  well, in this case, certainly it does matter, but the end-result matters too.  in fact, all of it matters, when you think about it, so for certain it would be a good idea to record.  anyhow.....  my name is van.  and i am in the process becoming a police officer.  (*fingers crossed*)  it all started with me wanting to be "in the field."  i was a disgruntled "professional" working in office space hell at the university of penis (er...phoenix) and i started to realize asking the question, "what the hell am i doing here?" became pretty routine.  somehow i had fallen off the track i had started.......  which somehow always involved law enforcement.  so i gathered some mental energy, quit my job, and started planning.

      been awhile since i real post.&nbsp; apologies.&nbsp; i've been a little antisocial since my parents have gone to toronto.&nbsp; they come back saturday so i'm looking forward to having them home again.&nbsp; meanwhile i've been here in my own head, burying myself in my drawings, working, and cleaning up the house.&nbsp; it's been nice and quiet, but i'll admit, a little lonely.&nbsp;   luckily for me, i have a good cell phone plan ;).  i've been pumping a lot of iron too and i'm starting to see a huge difference in my upper body.&nbsp; it's kind of cool!&nbsp; (heh, i'm obsessed.)  i want to get into boxing and walked into a boxing gym today but it costs a fortune to join.&nbsp; the salesman was trying to convince me to dish out $400 for a year membership.&nbsp; he's crazy!&nbsp;   still no word from SDPD which is making me anxious at night and keeping me from going to sleep at a good hour (yeah, it's like 3am right now, UGH.).&nbsp; i keep wondering and wondering and wondering.&nbsp; it is torturous.&nbsp; i need to learn patience.  i left a voicemail today.&nbsp; hopefully i will get a call back.&nbsp; still no news from references that they've been contacted, so what the heck is going on?!!!  no decline letters yet either.&nbsp; heh.  i've been looking at east coast departments - baltimore, va state police, philadelphia.&nbsp; some of them have pretty challenging physicals, which excites me.&nbsp; looks like i'll have to figure out the 10 second dummy drag afterall.  for the next few weeks i envision close to what i've been doing these past two weeks - working a whole lot, saving money, waiting for SDPD stuff, and drawing nearly everyday on my graphic novel.&nbsp; i'll elaborate further on it later when things start to materialize a little more.  anyway, MUST collapse.&nbsp; God bless, everyone.

      hi everyone!&nbsp; in efforts to keep in touch with friends and family alike i thought i would start a blog that records a summarized version of the ongoing drama in my life.&nbsp; all "freaking out" is literally vomited in my other "secret" online journal, so read this with no fear of getting a heart attack from my periodical hormonal surges :). &nbsp; i have just returned from my san diego-santa barbara-san francisco roadtrip with my best and longtime friend miriam, and am now trying to get back into the swing of things here in las vegas.&nbsp; i'm not thrilled to be back in the death-heat of the sin city, but realize that in order to move on with my police testing and job hunting i can't really be in la-la land forever.  &nbsp; i've been gone for about two weeks now, and am a little worried that my employers have gotten fed up with my absence and have decided to terminate my positions with their companies while i was gone in sunny california.&nbsp; i guess these fears are normal, and a strange part of me desires the freedom of being completely jobless.&nbsp;&nbsp; :D &nbsp; but i know that is probably not the case, and am returning to swimpractice with my swimteam ( urlLink http://www.swim-n-pipers ) tomorrow morning at 730am. &nbsp; i want to update you on the recent haps of my life.&nbsp;  &nbsp; so, let me try to do this...in some kind of organized fashion. &nbsp; lovelife:&nbsp; non-existent.&nbsp; ever having broken things off with the second T-O-M, vanissa has been putting nearly 100% of her efforts into her career aspirations.&nbsp; she enjoys the freedom of being completely single, particularly not having to deal with awkward moments of silence due to intellectual incompatibility and flaky promises made by the last ex.&nbsp; she has decided that singledom is the place for her heart right now. &nbsp; however, if you happen to know any Italian/Greek, cultured, educated, creative, smart, passionate, goodlooking, young, considerate, romantic, athletic men, please don't hesitate to set me up.&nbsp; hee hee. &nbsp; current jobs:&nbsp; life since 2002 have been quite different.&nbsp; currently i'm coaching 8&amp;under kids for the  urlLink Clark County Sandpiper SwimTeam  with fellow coaches Ron, Charlie and Chris, and i couldn't love it more.&nbsp; the kids are amazing and i learn something from them everyday.&nbsp;  &nbsp; i am also serving fake italian at the  urlLink Macaroni Grill . &nbsp; career aspirations:&nbsp; i've been roadtripping quite a bit to test for police departments all over.&nbsp; right now i am in the backgrounds process for  urlLink San Diego Police Department .&nbsp; i've come pretty far and this is the farthest i've ever gotten with any department.&nbsp; i've applied also to Lakes Crossing Center in Sparks, NV (northern NV) where i have been placed on an eligibility list.&nbsp; i got to experience my first oral board with them.&nbsp; in the past, i have applied to  urlLink San Diego Harbor Police Department,   urlLink Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department,  and plan on applying to these following departments:&nbsp;  urlLink Fountain Valley , Oxnard, Upland, Pasadena,  urlLink Newport Beach , and NYPD.&nbsp; i'm also in the middle of filling out the application for Criminal Investigator/Special Agent wth Homeland Security, an application process that takes nearly two years. &nbsp;  urlLink next stop is Newport Beach, CA  - August 14th.&nbsp; the physical agilities test is incredibly hard, so i'll be training really hard this month with cardio and weights at  urlLink Gold's Gym . &nbsp; should i get in with SDPD, i will be starting at the academy down at Miramar College in October.&nbsp; *fingers crossed* &nbsp; personal projects: currently working on an intervention to stop my close friend and co-worker dan from giving his life to his addiction of  urlLink methamphetamines. &nbsp; this episode has led me to obsessively study the effects of methamphetamines and other drugs, and has spawned a possible career interest in the  urlLink DEA.&nbsp;   &nbsp; a family member has recently developed  urlLink diabetes  type II so i have also been studying the disease closely.&nbsp;  &nbsp; recent mishaps with the  urlLink polygraph  have led me to study forensic psychophysiology - an old passion of mine - more closely.&nbsp; if i get into SDPD i will probably pursue appealing to SDHarbor PD since they disqualified me based on the polygraph i "failed."&nbsp; i was not lying and they need to pay closer attention to their hiring methods.&nbsp;  &nbsp; miriam and i recorded a video of our california-coast roadtrip and plan on editing the film, adding music to it, etc.&nbsp; so, i have a creative project in my hands, but first i must learn to become more computer/camcorder proficient! &nbsp; aside from that, i try to chill out as much as i can by enjoying hot beverages and learning to become more internet proficient, especially since i recently bought this laptop.&nbsp; fasting, praying, and mass are also everyday activities that i take part in, and strengthening my faith is a constant goal.&nbsp; keeping in touch with my family and friends&nbsp;is incredibly important to me and i hope that this website/blog will accomplish that!&nbsp; you can also leave "comments" on this website (it's pretty interactive, eh?) by clicking "post a new comment" at the end of each of my entries.&nbsp; i would love to hear from you and so would everyone else!! &nbsp; so leave comments,  urlLink email me , and read  urlLink The Full Circle  often!&nbsp; :) &nbsp; good things, -vanissa &nbsp; &nbsp;

      a million, uncountable, immeasurable, infinite pieces.  that's right.  i = current mess.  should i stay or should i go....  and WHAT IF i end up in freaking las vegas out of all of this.  out of trying to get out of this dirty town, i end up getting picked up by metro, and no where else, and then .. voila, i'm stuck in vegas, the blackhole of the world.  i talked to a metro recruiter today and told them i was DQed by SDPD and for what reasons..and if i should wait to apply, or should i apply now...  they said, APPLY.  so, that's what i'll do.  apply.  aug. 26th, written, aug. 31, physical.  then i'll hit up Oxnard on the weekend of Sept. 11.   COULD i stay in vegas during all this testing with Oceanside, Oxnard, Escondido, and whoever else?   it's possible.  i may not be able to apply to that many without being down there.   being down there.....is....  still a possibility.  it depends though, on many of a million things.  and all of a sudden i feel comfortable in vegas.  strangely comfortable.  i love my gym, for one thing, and have grown attached to the people there.  i've met a lot of cops there, and i've made connections there.   SIGH.  i don't know what to do.  then i talk to mir on the phone and she's like, "yeah, debbie, steph, me and you...all in NY, NEXT SUMMER!"  and i can totally see that happen.  i really can.  i seriously can see that but what does all that mean?  should i pack my bags up now and go???!!  raaaah.  i'm so confused.  and Dr. Bob says i should apply to LA County Sheriff's.  raah.  i'll have to sleep on it.  maybe coley can give me some insight tomorrow when we do lunch at the Sahara store.   DRUGS.  what do y'all think about my posters??  ciao.

       urlLink    professionally unemployed and overly disgruntled.  urlLink     this in new:  i didn't get into SDPD.  OH NO!!!  i found out a couple days ago, actually, but have been trying not to think of it too much to soften the blow.  as much as i tried to not "put all my eggs in one basket," deep inside i really counted on getting in.   so now i keep telling myself....SDPD is really hard to get into.  i keep reassuring myself that my police testing days aren't over.  they're not.....  but my ego has been seriously hurt.  do they realize what they're giving up??!!  obviously not.  humbled again.  first the failed polygraph, now this.  i was TOO honest, i feel.  but not just that, i am just the kind of person who feels guilty about everything, so my petty thievary was really blown out of proportion.   1.  i used to sell bootlegged music on ebay back in college.  i did this mostly in 2000-2001. 2.  i mentioned that i sold Einstein's Dreams on amazon.com for about $8-$10 a piece...however, did not mention this in the pre-investigative questionnaire.  this didn't come out until the polygraph with paul redden (dude who interviewed the killer in the danielle van dam case), because i had actually forgotten.  the reason i forgot was because it wasn't really theft.  and i talked to my ex-co-worker marty today to verify.  we were ALLOWED to take a few extra copies of Einstein's Dreams.  i just took a few extra, extra copies and sold them for money.  but, the important thing to remember is that i did have permission, i just abused my priviledge a little - so is that theft?  3.  i have stolen a pillows from motel 6 (i think 3), 2 fleece blankets from airplanes, 3 coffee cups from different restaurants, all which was done between 2002-2003.  4.  during my time at the Univ. of Phoenix i occasionally used their metered mail to send my bills.  and i made personal calls too.  that's really about it.    and you ask me why - WHY VANISSA, did you take all this stuff?   here is my justification:  i've never taken anything that anyone would ever miss;  that doesn't count as excess crap to the businesses they've belonged to.  not to say that it is RIGHT to do what i've done - no, not at all, but it certainly isn't as wrong as stealing money, or taking something from a store that has a price tag on it, or stealing someone's personal belongings.  these things have always been a crime to me - but the petty theft i've committed, i've always been able to justify it with, "who's going to miss it or even notice, or even care?"  what i should have been thinking the whole time is that it doesn't matter, and that you should not take what isn't yours to begin with.  or atleast ASK.  i bet you anything that if i ASKED motel 6 to take a few of their pillows that they'd be fine with it.  i'll even go into one and ask and post it on here later.  i also bet you that if i asked to keep those fleece blankets from those airlines they would have let me as well.  and you betcha, next time i get on an airplane i'm going to ASK.  and so...how crucial is my petty theft?   i've never done any drugs.   i've never physically assaulted anyone.  i've never gotten a speeding ticket.  so now what?  these small crimes are now coming back to bite me in the arse.  now i'm thinking, "i'm going to return everything i've stolen."  *shrug*  why not?  would it make me look better?  i'm not sure.  i talked to an escondido recruiting officer today and he was like, "is this some kind of pattern?"  i was like, "oh god, don't even try to profile me."   so now i'm wondering - should i wait a year to apply?  what should i do??  and i go back to what i really enjoy.  something that has to do with being physical and being active.  coaching has been awesome - but i can't live on it, it doesn't pay enough.  the whole private lessons thing is way too unstable to depend on, and becoming a fitness trainer takes a certification which requires a lot of time and money.  the sargeant at SDPD (David Swisskosky - i know that isn't spelled right, BUT, it's close to how you pronounce it) said that i am invited to reapply in TWO years.   TWO YEARS?!  two years.  hmm.  so that's left me to wonder, am i going to get DQed by other departments and get "invited to apply" (doesn't that make the blow seem less?  yeah, it certainly does.  good choice of words, Sarg) in TWO years as well???   so right now.....i'm trying to figure out what i'm going to do.  my friend and training partner vassie is going to talk to Gold's Gym down in San Diego to see if he can hook me up with a sales counselor position, which would be great because it pays well, you get free membership, and on my days off and hours off, i can work out!  :)  (i know, i'm a gym-rat, really, it's sad.)  here are my options:  move down to SD, transfer macaroni grills, stay with karvin, keep looking for jobs while going through police testing with Oxnard, Oceanside, Escondido, and possibly Newport Beach....and go on from there.  (which means i'll be in SD, nearly permanently.)  stay in Vegas, keep roadtripping back and forth from here to SD for testing, which is incredibly time-money consuming, and does not go well with my employers here...  pick my stuff up and just move back to Blacksburg.  i don't know what to do.   meanwhile, as you've noticed if you've been watching my posts, i've been drawing a whole lot of anti-drug stuff.  it's all body for my graphic novel, "The Raindrop Branches," a story about a young girl who falls in love with a boy who becomes addicted to methamphetamines.  this is somewhat autobiographical of my friend Dan and myself, but some things are different which is why it is fiction.   but the emotions are quite familiar...  losing someone to drugs is hard.  it's like watching someone you love slit their wrists slowly - normally it would take a couple hours for them to die, but instead, it is elongated to a period of weeks or months.   as i mentioned earlier, my friend nicole's site:   urlLink http://www.inkyndallsname.org   i really want to get involved with some kind of drug-free/anti-drug nonprofit organization...if i could get work in that arena that would be perfect.  my long-time mentor dr. bob wrote me and is encouraging me to apply to LAPD and LA County Sheriff's Dept.  but LA County requires you to work 4 years in the jails before you move on to anything else, and there is a really high turnover rate at LAPD, which can't be good.  i'm not fond of the idea....just yet.   *sigh* friends, please pray for me!  i need a little direction here.  time to go gym.  but first i think i'll go to kinko's and scan in the heroin poster i finished today.
