      Black out. A bare light bulb hanging down from the balcony is turned on. The ensemble stands in a clump just under the balcony behind the KT in the ‘pitch chair’ (where each NF’s sits for his or her ‘pitch’). The light is switched off when people switch to the chair on each stee-rike and switched on for each ‘pitch’.   RN: (leaning out a la laugh in) Hey Michael, Hey Michael.  Whachya readin’? MC: (leaning out a la laugh in with Time Out in Hand) Oh, nothing really! (tossing the magazine over his shoulder at the wall) JR: Steee-rike! KT: It’s 11:30, here’s the pitch: JR: Steee- DB: It’s 11:30, here’s the pitch: a plus size women is makin music—slappin her bare belly JR: Steee-  MF: It’s 11:30, here’s the pitch: 10 20-somethings eat bowls n bowls of wheaties—no, frosted flakes. JR: Steee- RC: It’s 11:30, here’s the pitch: these kids, 14 and 15 yr olds, deconstruct moby dick to just a lot of ‘Thar she blows!’ n ‘arrrghs!’ JR: Steee- LH: It’s 11:30 in Brooklyn, here’s the pitch: 10 20-somethings, who are all members of ‘up with people’, no, ‘theater sports…men…sports…people’, anyway, they do this show that’s all vaudeville sketches—sketchy pitches—it’s all pitches. JR: Steee- LH: Ripping Uke solo! MF plays her ukulele a bit, CD picks up the Time Out, walks to SR of chair and reads a few key phrases including ‘then a fat man sitting on a ukulele is a symphony’; they are eventually interrupted by the other NF’s chanting to a crescendo: NFs: Sit. Sit. Sit on it. Sit on it. sit sit sit! Symphony! MF: No one is fucking sitting on my ukulele, you sonsabitches! JR: Steee- RN: It’s 11:30, here’s the pitch: 24’s Kiefer Sutherland with Alias’s Jennifer Garner doing Canterbury tales in an old Brooklyn bathhouse, no just an old Brooklyn bathhouse full of courtesans, courtesans that will do what ever the audience asks– JR: Stee- RN: You gotta have a gimmick. KT: Monkeys! (KT holds a stuffed monkey) RN: You gotta have a gimmick  KT+CD: Monkeys and Pirates! (KT holds a stuffed monkey and wears an eye patch, CD has pirate gear on too) RN: You gotta have a gimmick! KT+CD+RC: Monkeys, Pirates and Bananas! (RC joins them with a banana)) JR: Steee-  MC: Time out. He ends with somewhere in Italy ‘the real Futurists are turning over in their graves’. Really, Marenetti, turning?  RN: No. Fillipo Marenetti loved crap critiques from crap critics.  MC: Maybe we should pander to those fans of futurism who’ve come to the Neo-Futurist show? RN: Alright. We will now end ‘time out neo-trav s.d.’ with the ensemble making machine noises, revolutionary statements, absurd sounds and doing something mechanical all at once—viva simultaneity!  More lights and all NF’s do this (maybe including the statements “Pour me out”, “Down with Government”, “Brooklynis sumus”, “Crab-cake critics”, “Bananas, Monkey and Pirates”, and “Simultaneity!” peaking with Molly moving to the front and raising her Ukulele high above her head:  MF: None of you sonabitch are touchin’ my Uke!

      Write this on your sandwich board and walk  the streets on your lunch break. Wear a red knit cap. When no one is looking, stand on the tops  of green mailboxes and speak eloquently. Yell if you have to. When the police tell you to stop, obey. If they ask for your name, disobey. When they ask for ID, hand them your wallet. Have a compact mirror in the plastic window.  They are not going to find this funny.  Maybe it's because they are afraid of what the captain will say when they let you go and the next day buy sandwich boards. More likely they are afraid of their brothers, of letting them down, pissing them off, getting them killed.  You can relate to the police, their concerns  are genuine and no doubt hightened by the everyday violence and public scrutiny. You have brothers too. You are not afraid of the police. Give them your compassion.  Go back to work.  There is more.

      I'm sixty eight years old. I've been saving this cola bottle since the 20s. It's not going to be pretty. I hope to elevate my consciousness. You don't know what they used to put in this stuff. They had us all hooked back in the day. I expect that it's been fermenting long enough to cause hallucinations.  This bottle was made to endure bullet trauma. It's a freakin' tank with a nasty payload. I've always been afraid of side effects. Now that I'm old, it's time to try. Nothing but 'shroom pizza and brownies for me.  (Author's Note: it is at this moment that my own attention span has reared it's ugly head and reminded me why I'm no good at fiction... skipping ahead.)  I--I see the dinosaurs. They had pet bunnies.  (fast forward)  The big bang was a science project.  (fast forward)  Jesus was a woman.  (rewind)  "They mistranslated the Word of God! It was supposed to say CELEBRATE!"  (fast forward)  "'The sleeper has awaken'," he says to me. I wish he was right. I can feel my sweat dripping skin. Blood, ketchup, hot dogs, bits of stomach. I'm eating myself slowly starting with my nails. The day is longer than forever.  (fast forward)  The camera zooms revealing the man's hand clutching a bottle. The skin of his knuckles are chapped and bleeding. Fade to black. Roll credits.

      this bright white bus stops for the wheelchair brigade heading to pier 54  and some late pissy lady calls some assistant on her cell phone to complain about the driver 'i am on 41st st. and the bus driver is an idiot'  and she says it very loudly and the driver drives her slowly to her stop 4 stops down on 19th st.  and she gets outside the slow bus and  angry limps away  you'd think she'd show some understanding on any sunny day like today

      Her brother has given her a stone from Nice. She has it in her pocket.  When she rubs it she  swears she can hear the ocean, the waves  colliding into the cobbled shore. She is going there to return it. Take the A to JFK, then a Boeing 757 to Paris, and finally the Euro rail to Nice, but first, this downtown D local. 6:30, Saturday morning and it is as crowded  as it is on any given rush hour weekday. And not because it is running local. The 80+ in each car, every seat occupied  with shut-eyed strap hangers, are Uptown: The Harlem Black, the Washington Heights  Dominican, the Bronx Boriqua and lesser  shades of brown from parts unknown. She wonders how the stone will sound  when she rubs it in Nice.  When the concierge gives her a thick mat of a towel for the beach.  The train stops, inappropriate between stations,  She hears the sucking of teeth, disgust in 3  or more languages and feels their eyes find her:  Sunglasses riding above her forehead,  sweater draped over her shoulders, Coach weekender at bend of elbow, Swiss Army Pullman in hand. An A express jettisons past the stalled D. She watches, its cars nearly empty,  cleaner, and yes, whiter.  Hopefully  she thinks, it will be waiting for her at 59th Street. She seeks anonymity in her newspaper.              The hostages still suffering in an unwelcome world,             awaiting the shimmering release of another man's sword.             Yes, such a shame about the hostages, the suffering.             They go there to work, make money for their families             back home.  They must have had targets taped              to their backs the moment they stepped on the tarmac.             The culture shock, coming from everything to somewhere so sparse.             And then the ungodly happens, capture.   The train jerks and ambles to the next local station. She balances herself and her luggage to the silver pole. Watches them, all of their eyes closed, guards down  under the meditation of the subway's motion. She wants to read the prayers trickling out their lips, learn the math of their struggle.         The train stops. Doors open.  No one gets on. She looks at the face of an older man. His face, used to the stare of strangers, is like a mask. A devil's mask.  A wrinkled ruddy barman face.   His hair a thick greased back black.  He wears a green laborer's uniform, rests his bloated belly on his lap. She looks at the plainness of the teenage girls slumped beside each other at the paired window seats. Their summers sandwiched in these air conditioned cars, getting their beauty sleep between express stops.              In the sports section, the American Tennis pros are fuming about             the line judge and his botched calls at Wimbledon.  They want his             head on a stick, and another shot at the tournament.  Who remembers             the asterisk next to a champion's name.  And who cares about those             who do.  They don't write endorsement contracts.    The train jerks, rocks like an empty cradle and she bashes into the silver pole again.  She touches the scab she scraped off a rough weekend at the Hamptons.  Pets but does not pick. She looks at the man to her left, sees his cell block  green tattoos ladder up his over sized sleeves.   Letters, numbers, symbols she cannot discern.   He is better off, she decides.  The D train makes it to 59th Street. Her A train long left.   She exits into the wave of heat from the platform leaving  nearly all of the passengers.  When another A express comes it will have 10 varied yet more familiar identities.   She will take one of the 70+ empty seats and finish her paper  on route to the airport.  When she takes her seat on the plane  she will rub the stone her brother gave her and the ocean  will sound a lot like the D train.

      telepathy has taken over. i no longer have to ask where it hurts. right there behind that uterus ricochet clong, yellow bruises   pattern fate like the hollow blocks of a xylophone. im thinking of heads shaped like hers.   bald.   pero no puedo pensar asi.  waiting rooms are evil. suspense can break even hunger. their television yanks through my mind master delete  and commercials with smiling babies present themselves,  like this one, at the most inopportune times.  ive ripped out every prayer written from my  pentecostal years and made promises i wouldn’t   normally keep to turpentine these scars before they were wounds.  i ask for a break. symptoms have grown plump these days.   my worry doll from guatemala understands the secrets,  more than the punching bag she uses when no one is looking.  lungs have lost their job description and i try to barter with god,  my hair for hers, a poem for a swollen belly.  no armor could protect her there. a canyon pain like black tears barracuda.  im thinking of visiting hours and what I would say to her  after vomiting a third time that day.  pero no puedo pensar asi.  my face has more lines since wednesday though. the napalm burns between my ribs and  she wants to be the god mother to every single  one of my children even more now.  her face tells me everything. the cancer planet has threatened an invasion.

      There is a tiny bottle. Always this measured dose of whiskey for the turning of Friday night. She empties it into a tumbler, bottomed with crushed ice, discharged from the hungry mouth of the refrigerator. Then adds a spritz of soda water from their antique seltzer bottle. A relic: Gift from a friend long dead for a wedding long past. She sips her scotch and soda in front of the television, watches whatever he is watching: the middle of a game or movie, This does not matter - like walking.

      There are people who are meant to be with out certain things-- glasses, ice cream, love, dogs.  There are people who are always going to ruin what they touch;  There are people who give away too much; There are people that stay silent watching us.  There are days when you need a sandwich and I make you a sandwich and you laugh near me and I think of a stand of maple trees outside Shawano.  There are days when someone steals  all your cds, your bike,  your heart, your favorite pen.  I wrote this because I could not say what I needed  to you today because I did not know  how I really felt until now.

      and it was during the last round of holy rolling on a Sunday morning that the hymns became  lullaby/ and the preacher's drone stroked the eardrum like a tired hand/ and the eyes slipped into the excellence of a dreamt mattress.    eleven a.m. and all the critics love you in new york.  and it was off the edge of the mattress after an evening of sweat-filled eyes/ lusting/ open to the possibilities of love/ and the lack of sleep heavy in the air/ and the empty  corsets taking up precious room in the bureau  eleven a.m and all the critics love you in new york  and it was the cracks in the photo of san lazaro on the bureau faded with years of supplication to a god that  listened only sometimes/ and it was the faith that shook to the bone/ and it was the whispered prayer that reached the roof  eleven a.m. and all the critics love you in new york  and it was the afternoon of sunbathing on the roof outstanding like girl you knock me out soaked into pores/ and it was the catcalls of  quema quema quemarikwini   bugalu  lovely cocoa butter skin smashed the barrio like no worries, no worries, I got this sun  eleven a.m. and all the critics love you in new york  and it was the first glint of weekend sun doused in the chrism of holy lovemaking the night before/ and it was the long kiss goodbye when the taxi came (life has other plans sometimes)/ and it was the phone call expected sometime after church  eleven a.m. and all the critics love you in new york  and I still enjoy watching the crowd file out of the church from my perch across Madison/ and I still feel you in  my joints at the scent of fried catfish/ and I still know  your body when lenny plays  I belong to you and you (you) you belong to me too  (but I still hate catfish)  eleven a.m. and all the critics love you in new york  and the catfish frying in the church/ and the lord's roof pondering the sun/ and the mattress and the bureau say their amens/ and you are morning gone, still, loved  in new york.

      Pink. Hot pink. With a little, tiny, micro-sized bow in the front. A thong, of course. Victoria's secret. That's all I know, which is quite frankly enough. Believe it or not I don't want to know. Yes I love women, and I undoubtedly love their panties. My question is, why do I have to know all of this? Buy some higher-rise jeans or maybe a nice long sweater. In casual conversation your undergarments should not become a subject of interest. If it was, I would tell you that mine are boxers, with little, tiny, micro-sized thumb-tacks, scattered about in a beautiful color arrangement by Tommy Hilfinger. If I didn't tell you this and you didn't ask then you should never know that my underwear is "tacky."

      Some things develop later in life. Love interests, hair-loss, taste in music, lactose intolerance, cancer, etc. In this particular case it's an allergic reaction to pickles. Not dill, only the Kosher ones. Not to be anti-Semitic, it's just the use of preservatives is different between the two. Not sure if it's all pickled foods, and never will, for fear of uncontrollable itchiness and swelling.

      he is learning slowly that the days between heartbreaks are not fixed by some preacher, tailor, blacksmith, or milkmaid. The story of his sleeves is one of tragic tearing, biting, gnashing. this is the soul of metamorphosis.  where butterflies begin metamorphosis by enveloping silk around their days, the teeth of the evening slowly gnashing wail their chain gang song, fixed upon the furious bloodstains on the sleeves of the woman who would be blacksmith.   the hammer drops. perplexed blacksmith smashing swords in iron metamorphosis wipes her brow on frustrated sleeves, refusing to drink. His are sterile days of hairs standing on neck, eyes fixed forward, knuckles and feet gnashing  in rhythm to fingers and bone gnashing against the forehead of the blacksmith, stubborn, nihilistic, refusing to be fixed unconscious of his slow metamorphosis over these impossible grinding days etched upon both of their tired sleeves.  the light threads of lace upon sleeves. a bride's father nervously gnashing  his teeth. a mother prays for better days like a twitch in the hands of the blacksmith spending her life living the metamorphosis of the butterfly, her anvil still fixed   to the ground. today, two lovers are fixed like heavy stripes upon the sleeves of the dawn of their metamorphosis gone are the hours of iron gnashing iron, here and now, steady blacksmith smiles at the recompense of dark days.  he will have done with the gnashing. he will feel the lace in her sleeves.  he will live in the marrow of her days.

      She sips a soda. He is being spun and does not feel the train stopping what is in the wake—trouble  is not hard to find drizzling on this island. It confuses him why not enough people carry umbrellas;  around him rummed posters sit wet with advertisements for some  sharper, happier, fuzziness.  Fizzy sips of soda. And four blocks west old docks clock the waves rocking the boats  stopping the water from being too still—  Still he knows that Jersey does not equal Brooklyn does not equal him or this sick shooting—shooting something pretty near him—maybe it pained him just to see that,  Or maybe he misfired.  But deeply wrong streamed red from his finger quickly like web from a spidered man,  as she sipped her soda.  Where did he go?

      A steady chorus of rain drums the window like a call to worship.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  At midnight, on a bed&nbsp;thirteen floors up, I watch you make playthings of the subconscious.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We chant with eager lips the songs our ancestors taught us, linked beneath the roof like stars trapped in an abacus.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I struggle to catch my trembling breath, while your eyes study my geometry.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The future is the past and the present is a slow leak in the ceiling, dripping disapproval in an aluminum pot.  &nbsp;  This is the time we should be planning for the end of our mediocrity, owning houses together, increasing bottom lines, getting up, studying more, perhaps considering veganism.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  At midnight, I detect the distinct lure of silk beneath your jawline, beckoning right now romance in the half light.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  You watch me move my head slowly, searching the inches between us for universes long past.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  You find me there.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The cracks in the ceiling are maps to the rainforests.  &nbsp;  We obey the only history that matters.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We kiss for centuries.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The rain is sounding an Avenue D Love Supreme, a minaret torch song, playing prayers from the window with ancient angels, soaked to bone.&nbsp;

        she said it's an expression of individuality - not a one upmanship. r' on the topic of essays, and why she liked to write them, versus the dread of he, towards the task - which seemed a contest of wills and intellect.       &nbsp;    run on , run along said the thought.       &nbsp;   and then they spent the day at the beach.       &nbsp;   i am now a toasted girl.

       A Day Like Today  -  Bic Runga   Lala lala-la  Lala lala-la   There's nothing like a cool autumn breeze Sending the past up with the leaves Watching all the clothes on the line In a sidestepping dance With the neighbouring trees   Lala lala-la    There's nothing like an echoing hole A headrush of sky A knock at the door A message on your voicemail tonight The answering-machine taking the calls   It's an honest mistake Falling in love At any given time We could get carried away It could've happen to anyone   On a day like today A Day like today On a day like today Day like today   Day like today On a day like today A day like today   There's nothing like a cool autumn breeze Sending the past up with the leaves Watching all the clothes on the line In a sidestepping dance With the neighbouring trees    It's an honest mistake Falling in love At any given time  We could get carried away It could've happen to anyone   On a day like today A Day like today On a day like today Day like today   Day like today On a day like today A day like today
