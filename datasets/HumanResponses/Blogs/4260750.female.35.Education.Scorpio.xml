      We met a new friend from a Delphi forum for lunch today. We loved meeting her and her very beautiful little girl. Jon and I desperately want to be parents but I had a hysterectomy 4 years ago. We have no problem with adoption, other than the fact that we can't afford it. Anyway, lunch was fun. I made a pig of myself with some brocoli/mushroom pasta.   We are having our new computer desk delivered tomorrow and I am SO excited. We have friends who bought a huge office full of furniture to sell. We bought this enormous wood desk and a small round table for a tremendously good price. I really love furniture. I swear one day I need a huge home just so I can buy furniture every week. I also bought three chairs at a garage sale. But I swear, I'm finished buying furniture for awhile. I swear.   I have a conference tomorrow to learn the computer system at the junior college I will be teaching at starting Monday. Do I have a syllabus yet? Nope. I have procrastinated beyond where I ever thought I would or could!   What purpose to mosquitos play on this earth? Honestly, do we need to keep them?

      My gums don't hurt today. Actually, Advil is my best friend.   I finished reading Something Rotten by Jasper Fforde. It's the 4th in the Thursday Next series. I love these books! It's hard when you finish a really good book and you know it will be awhile before another really good one comes your way. I was reading Reading Lolita in Tehran before I realized the latest Fforde book was out. I'll go back to that one, but I don't really want to leave the Fforde behind. I might have to reread the first three.   I really need to get off my ass and get over to the school district to register as a substitute teacher. It's pitiful that I have to find a second job.   Jon is almost finished painting the dining room. I am so happy! I am such a bad painter, so glad he's doing it. And that's all there is for today.

      There we go. Took me a moment to figure out how to compose a blog. I have no idea if this will actually work since I clicked on the "edit HTML" button. But it wouldn't let me type anything when I was in "compose" mode.   Not really sure what to write. I went to the dentist today and found out I have to have a gum graft. No one ever taught me how to properly brush my teeth. Bastards!   Jon is finishing painting the dining room. He painted it a dark brown. It looks good, I was hesitant about the color. He's an engineer but he hasn't been able to find an engineering job so he's working for Border's. Neither one of us are very happy about that. The pay is absolute crap! I'll be starting my new job as an adjunct faculty member at a local junior college. I'm only teaching one class but I am quite nervous. I'm afraid of expecting too much from the students. Then again, I don't want to treat them like idiots.   My gums hurt.
