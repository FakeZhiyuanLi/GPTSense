       Feeling: Tired but yet energetic   Listening To: The Ataris-Takeoffs and Landings     Hey World!     I dont know why but i love saying that. er rather typing that. I have decided sara is the coolest bass clarinet player cause shes taping cadet kelly for me so i can review the rifle crap in it. and you know what. thats pretty fricken cool in my book. and my book is hard to get into. okay maybe not but still i can wish! lol im such a loser! mwahahahaha. Band camp went fine the only thing that made me mad was the fact that Catherine didnt show up but it doesnt matter cause shes out of rifles. which remindes me that i need to update my website. shit happends you know. im just really happy shes out cause she was getting on my nerves. and bragging. there is only one thing i hate more than bragging and if you do it i hate you forever.     Listening To: The Ataris-In This Diary     Anyway Sara is a real life saver for doing that cause you know we didnt have any blank tapes like normal. i swear my family is crazy! lol oh well. beth is probably not home but i want to talk to her anyway to tell her such things. anyway i think im done. Band camp went well as usual. Actually wait im not done i still havent typed about the one person that got on my nerves! Miss Ginny. I know of all people she was the one that pissed me off the most! its crazy! Well she wont tell us who made co-captain for some reason and we all think its because she doesnt want to let go of the glory of being captain. I know what a lame excuse! Anyway. She hasnt been doing a whole lot. I mean we (as in me and beth. mostly beth.) made up the feature! THE FEATURE! its crazy! i mean we normally wouldnt be doing that but we did and its better than the crap she made up! Mrs. Winn came and we showed her our routine and she loved it but ginny sat there all smug. I was like okay whatever. and she was trying to get us to make up stuff for the next show, which might i remind you we have 3 weeks to work on, when she didnt have anything for 2 of the other songs! i was like well why dont we make up those first? and she just like didnt listen to me! i was mad! and beth tried to get her to let us do some singles or the other routines and she didnt really listen to her either! miss ginny has stopped listening to us!  HOW MAD WERE WE?? REALLY FRICKEN MAD!  its not right because she gonna make it so we have no clue what were doing when shes gone and that no fair to the rest of the squad. we've all agreed to have a co-captain when we are seniors and considering there are no juniors in rifles shes should pick a sophmore. it really makes me  MAD!             Well i believe i've ranted enough for tonight! Remeber folks our first show is this friday! And For all the LV band members were having a bake sale after tomarrow's practice!

       Feeling: Achy Bored Weird   Listening To: New Found Glory-All Down Hill From Here       Wow Bright Colors. Well anyway Right now im kinda Weird feeling. Cant Explain it. Well it 8:04 and its time you were up to date. ahahahaha ive always wanted to say that.  Well as you probably guessed im gonna be a 10th grader. I get to start drivers ed soon too! which is quite exciting i must say! Im pretty young for my grade considering my birthday is late october other than having to wait to get my driving stuff its okay. I have an Older brother who is almost 18! and thats fricken crazy! Uh i have like a whole fricken crap load of friend whom all i wont mention cause i know most of you dont care but hey they are important to me all the same. I am a member of our school band although i go beyond just the class. I play Bass Clarinet, Eb Contra Alto Bass Clarinet, Bari Sax, Flute, and Soon Guitar. I love Playing music. I think i might become a band director when i get older. I think it would be a cool job. Im in quite a few acceled classes. I also play softball and write poetry. Okay enough of my boring after school stuff. On to something more exciting. Considering i dont really care what people think of me im just going to come out and say that i like brent titus and not care but truly thats just me. Well i used to like him but considering i havent seen him since the end of computers i might like see him and just upchuck but that kinda stupid i dont think i would. Well thats about my life right there. Well other than my weird dreams. Sara and Jess know what im talking about. I think im gonna go get ice cream.
