      There's  Gary .  he drinks just regular coffee.. cream and sugar.. every once in a while he gets a  fancy  coffee which he lets us choose what to put in it. and then he makes orgasmic noises and says how great is. he neatly folds up a dollar and puts it into the tip jar, making sure we're paying close attention to his generosity  He owns a pawn shop in town.. i can tell by looking at him in the eyes that he's a lonely man.. he has this laugh that sounds sometimes forced and sad and sort of desperate.. he's a talker.. he used to live in the bay area and has a degree or two in business.. he came back to his hometown to take care of his dying mother, leaving a woman behind and hasn't ever gone back..  he has the worst luck.. his car was vandalized a few times.. his partner in the business up and left one day, not really telling him why.. his shop has been broken into.. [the last time it happened, he came in looking crazed.. he said that he wished the kids would've gotten stuck trying to get in and he would've left them there to die, stuck in the vents in the ceiling of his shop.. (i guess that's how they got in) he said a few times that they're lucky that he didn't show up there when they were still here.. mumbling stuff about guns and the whatnot] when bad things happen to him, he appears very sad and troubled and worried and scary..  there was a time when he seemed so depressed that i thought he might actually kill himself.. seriously..  at the moment, he has a pseudo-girlfriend whom he likes to make sexual innuendos about...  joan .. he says things about how he didn't get much sleep the night before.. stuff like that.. but he scared her with a christmas present (a fancy ring) and they went through some rough times.. i guess she freaked out about it.. and actually got mad.. they play a lot of pool i guess.. billiards..

      i'm thinking of writing a book.. i'm a coffee girl, a  Barista , and i see loads of things from behind that steaming espresso machine.. not only am i a coffee chick, but i'm a coffee chick in a fairly small town... and it so happens that small town has a college in it.. small liberal arts.. but in  No Way  is it a college town.. so not only are there regulars from the college but from the community around us..  my characters would be easy, they come in every day.. looking for their fix.. (and it's like being a bartender except these people are weirdly sober.. well.. not all of them..) they give us so much information about themselves...  it's a perfect place for people watching... and these people are so interesting you could write a bob dylany song about it.. or something... a raymond carver short story..

      Annoying Customer Habits #1:  i can't stand it when people come into the coffee shop and will not decide what they want.. they refuse to do it.. they stare at the menu and the line will pile up behind them and then they say -  Oh.. Just make me whatever.. I don't care..  and i know they care.. everyone cares.. no one will want to pay for something they don't want to drink.. people are really particular about their coffee.. and when they say that, they're most likely going to be disappointed..  so we have to either ask them a series of questions about things they don't or don't like (which usually annoys them. which is a good things, but still annoying to us as well) or we just pick something and make it and hope they will at least not make a big deal out of it..  there is an alternative. we always have a Drink of the Day picked out. and it's just fine for someone to come in and say - i'll have whatever the Drink of the Day is.. several people do that.. there's a professor from across the street who drinks nothing but the Drink of the Day.. a good pal o' mine took to that habit.. that's just fine.. because then we have something to make.. something specific..  but if you can't decide and want something random, then pick something random.. don't leave it up to the person making the drink.. there's too much pressure..

      there's  Stephanie ..   she drinks a caramel macchiato (a drink starbuck's has on their menu, we don't, but we make it for her anyway because she's  that  nice to us.. but i don't know how to spell it..) with only half milk/half foam.. when she takes her drink she taps it on the counter two or three times so the caramel on top will drop through the foam and into the milk.. she will never complain about a drink..   she's a germaphobe.. or.. whatever phobia it is that makes you very conscious of germs and scared of them.. if you are sharing any sort of food with her she'll use a separate fork for each bite.. because the fork will have touched her mouth and she won't touch the food again with it..   she had that stomach reduction surgery where they take out either part of your stomach or parts of your intestines.. she was pretty large, like three hundred pounds large, but is now pretty damn thin.. she keeps old driver's licenses and things in her wallet to maybe remind herself of how big she used to be.. she eats ice as substitutes for food.. she'll pour coffee over ice to make herself feel better about eating it.. she just chipped a couple of teeth doing this..   she hates men.. well.. she doesn't trust them to be nice to her or any of that.. she's been married twice, i think.. and she makes odd references about them being abusive assholes.. but she will say all kinds of sexist things about men.. she's divorced now, unmarried, single..   the kicker is she has four sons.. they all look absolutely not related and have completely different personalities.. since she has this germ phobia, and possibly because she has a sort of male phobia, she doesn't hug her kids very often.. (so whenever they come in, us baristas make sure we get double hugs from them.. and they love it..)   she tips really well. she bought the coffee shop a rafting trip last summer and the baristas and our boss all went out on the river.. she's very giving..   that's  Stephanie ..

      the  Sugar Frees..     there are three of them. a mother and her two kids. they are all over the age of fifty. they always arrive somewhere around three thirty/four o'clock in the afternoon. they come for happy hour (buy one get one free or a dollar off any drink over two dollars).  Toasted Marshmallow Man gets a 12 ounce latte with three shots and three times as much toasted marshmallow syrup as one would normally put in a twelve ounce drink. with whole milk. he's somewhere around the age of sixty. he's very very conservative and likes guns. he's crass and once made a remark about how the baristas are all going to college and working at the coffee shop until they get pregnant and have to get married. something along those lines. he's also made comments to the two guys who work for the gas company that stop in the afternoon for coffee. he also likes to buy five pounds of coffee beans and gets one pound ground and then will bring in the following four pounds every few days to get some of it ground.  the mother daughter team drink twelve ounce (unless it's hot outside. then they're iced sixteen ounces) lattes with any sugar-free syrup. besides watermelon or strawberry. because mom is allergic to strawberries, and so they just want to be safe. and it's up to the barista which flavor they drink. i always mixed and matched. vanilla and hazelnut. or chocolate and english toffee. or i'd do just plain vanilla. easy enough.  when they pulled up the boss would say " Sugar Frees!"  which sounds as unnerving as it looks. we would get to work immediately. along with their drinks they got two ballpoint pens, two straws, two napkins and the daily word jumble. (which was usually in the back 'cause us baristas did the crossword puzzle every day.) they would sit down at the same table and do the jumble. and it has to be mentioned that the mother of these two people was rumored to be 92 years old. she was a sweet old lady (which was always sort of strange because the old fella was so mean.) and you could hear her laughing whenever they couldn't solve a word or at something someone said to them, usually about how they're in there every day.  and after they finished their lattes, they would bring the cups around and get regular coffee out of the airpots.. (we brewed eight coffees every day..) over and over.. this always made the employees snort and complain because they would get the happy hour deal and then drink a bunch of regular coffee for free.. milking us for all they could..  that's the  Sugar Frees..       ** i also had a run-in with toasted marshmallow man outside of the coffee shop.. my roommates and i had a yard sale one year.. and he stopped over.. and bought this jacket my roomie jen bought for a college party.. it was an old granny bingo looking jacket.. with flashy designs on it.. i think it was part of a running suit ensemble.. but he tried it on and purchased it.. and then asked jen (verbatim) "Can I use your bathroom to take a piss?" what a sweetheart.

      although i don't work at the coffee shop any longer, i can't get these people out of my head. so i'm going to continue to talk about them. i'll tell their small stories. with as much memory as i can.  because gosh darn it, people are interesting. really. interesting.

      i don't like Ken..   i'm not a big jeopardy fan. i enjoy watching the show, but i don't watch it religiously or anything. i'm not planning on trying out. but i've watched it the last few days because Ken keeps winning.   and i don't like him. i think today was his fifteenth or sixteenth win. he seems to have a big ego. he smirks. he knows too much. and he's tricky. final jeopardy is never a problem with ken, even if he doesn't know the answer. he will never wager enough to get close to any other contestant's answer.   he elaborates in his 'questions'.    (for anyone who's never seen the damn show, the idea is the contestants provide the questions for the answers which they're given. the questions are statements and the answers have to be formed as a question. wow. that explanation makes the show more complicated. hm.)    when there was an 'answer' about brigham young, he let us know that we was an alum of BYU and that's why he knows what the 'question' is.   yeah thanks ken. this isn't 'who wants to be a millionaire' where that kind of behaviour is encouraged. we just want your question. give us the information and let us move on to the next category.   he says things in funny voices. there was a category today with the word "mexico" in it. and when he chose that category, he uses this fake mexican accent to pronounce the word. this bothers me. (it actually bothers me in most situations, not just ken's)   but. the  other  contestants are great. i actually saw a woman enter (roughly) "whatever ken wrote for his answer" in final jeopardy. she wagered the minimum bet.. and since no one could read her answer - bad handwriting - she had to read it outloud.. and it was in the most cynical voice.. she smirked.. it was great..   a day or so later another woman wrote "I want my two dollars!" for her final jeopardy answer. now. alex didn't get it. i don't think ken got it. and if you don't get it. watch    urlLink   Better Off Dead   . the paperboy from hell. this made my day. possibly my favourite moment on jeopardy. a reference to a john cusack 80's movie. you can't get much better than that.   but. he still bothers me.   that's where you'll find me now.   watching too much television.

      i've been looking for a job. and i don't mean a career or anything too serious or anything really specific. i'll do anything.   i'm not asking much. just a paycheck. a place to go during the day so i'm not sitting at home watching back-to-back episodes of      urlLink   dawson's creek    and  urlLink   days of our lives   ..   so i drove two or so hours last tuesday to reno. my brother lives there. and i will live there soon enough. and i did the whole job search thing. until today. i made a list of places (mostly using the internet for the information) i would like to work and their addresses and i visited them. time after time shut down. shut down because they just aren't hiring. i didn't even get a chance.   (and there's the whole driving around a city you don't know very well all day in the heat and the traffic. add that to the mix.)   so i took some applications from places that aren't even looking for help. i emailed my resume to a few places i found on the university's job board. i asked around. i got a lead from a lady who suggested a coffee shop in a casino - they have a high turnover rate, which is not really a  good  sign. but i kept missing the lady i was going to talk to. so i'll be trying again when i drive back over to reno next tuesday.   i'm driving back and forth because i have no place to live. my not having a place to live is in direct relation to my not having a job. (imagine a rock and a hard place here. or a catch-22.) i don't have enough money to really put a deposit and first month's rent down on a place. and i think having a place to live in the city i'm going to be working (and going to school) in would help. immensely.   to recap: i need a job. in order to get a job i need a place to live. but in order to get a place to live i need money. and to get money i need a job.   i did have a plan. originally, my brother who lives there (and has a good job and an extra $2500 a month - he likes to tell me about his financial situation.. saying things like "it's weird.. i just don't know what to do with this extra money.." all the while i'm thinking of ways to steal this $2500 from him every month. that's more money than i've ever saved up. but. i digress. end of parentheses.) was supposed to have bought a house. and i was going to live with him. for not very much money. so i was going to have a cheap place to live while going to graduate school. but. it hasn't worked out that way.   and i think he's starting to realize - it's his couch i'm sleeping on after all - how  much  things haven't worked out. which is good.   which sounds like i'm taking him for granted, or expecting a lot out of him, or not appreciating him, or being selfish.. but it's not really that way at all. he's family after all.. and he's the one who offered in the first place..   but that wasn't my original idea i was working on when i started this. it was the fact that i'm unemployed. and job searching really shtinks. and the only real way to get a job one might enjoy is through connections. networking. which isn't all that nice when one moves to a new city.   it's frustrating.   and that's where you'll find me now.   frustrated.

       (let me just say, as a sort of disclaimer, that this is probably my third blog i've started.. and well.. updating is always a problem.. but this time i'm really going to try.. really..)    yeah. i did the college thing. (although it won't reflect in my use of capital letters and proper punctuation. i'm an  e.e. cummings  kind of chick..)   i went four years plus an extra semester. i studied abroad. i went the whole nine yards. plus a few extra.   and it's funny.. it's funny because i'm in so much debt that the amount of money i owe has become unreal.. it's surpassed the point where i understand how much money that  actually is .. i've been in the position where i'm surrounded by big piles of cash.. tens of thousands of dollars.. and it just becomes what it is.. piles of pieces of smelly paper.. it loses all value for those hours i'm counting it..   which is good, i guess.. because if i started thinking about how much money it was.. then i would think about what i could do with all of that money.. (i.e. settling my student loan debts?) and then i could get into lots of trouble.. and spend time in prison..   but. back to my original point. i'm not alone. i'm another twenty-something who's just graduated and i'm not going into a career right away.. in fact, i don't even have a job.. and this is  Normal .. most of the kids that i should've graduated with last june have been out of school for a year and still don't have jobs.. or have everyday jobs like baristas in coffee shops or shit like that..   (which. let me interject - i don't find anything wrong with. i think too many people find fault in people doing jobs like that..)   and. most of these kids are now considering going to graduate school mostly because they think it's their only real choice.. they can't find anything else to do, so they might as well get back into the world of academia.. (definitely a whole 'nother world.. they're strange people..) and some feel that they don't belong in any other place but in that world.. they can't function without it or something close to that.. i'm not sure..   but. i don't have much room to talk. because this fall i'm starting a secondary education first time licensure master's program. which is slightly different than going to graduate school.. what with the definite end, the goal to work for, the excuse:   "i'm going to get my teacher's certification.. it just was merely coincidental that it's a master's program.."   because. for some reason, i don't want to go to Graduate School. i've always said it was something i didn't want to do.. and it's not like i'm going for four years and writing a super dissertation on some topic and getting my PH.D out of it.. so.. it's cheating, sort of..   but. that's where you'll find me now.

       urlLink     &nbsp;(picture of The Space assigned to my (maybe) new apartment)  urlLink      well. i may've done it. i may have a place to live whilst furthering my education. a "charming" (small) place up the hill from the university. and it's only maybe because we're waiting to see if the chick i'm living with can cough up the cash to put down for the deposit/first month's rent by the time the landlady wants it. which is also a problem for myself. seeing that the day she wants us to throw the cash down is five days prior to when i get paid. lovely timing.   did i mention i have a job? i do. i "telecommute" every day. i do internet research. i surf the world wide web all day. i have this two columned table i put information in. i'm trying to make it sound as exciting as it is to perform. it's a job that requires dexterity (to move the mouse and use shortcut keys simultaenously) and an attention span. i make it interesting by, well, i don't. but it's a job i can do from the comfort of my own home. which is good. no fancy working clothes for me. i can wear the same thing every day and no one'll notice. except for the dog. he might.   but. looking for places to live is  almost  as fun as finding a job. easier, yes, but still as annoying. and it's much better when you're not alone, i've found. i'm living with a girl i've known since i moved to nevada. that was in 1990. fourteen years. a long frickin' time. i'm reluctant only because i wanted to live by myself, having done the dorm life thing and then the college roommate thing.. (which i've always been extremely lucky to have lived with loads of great people.) i wanted do Go Solo, as they say. but financially it's better to do it this way.. i'll be saving somewhere around two hundred buckaroos per month by having a roommate. most studio apartments i looked at were somewhere between four and five hundred dollars per month. which i understand is cheap compared to, say, brooklyn where my sister lives. she pays three times as much as what i'm going to pay. but. that's the price you pay for living in b-ville.   anyway. i'm sure this is about as exciting as it was for me to experience.. but finding places to live is something most of us folks go through.. i guess.. right?   but. that's where you'll find me now.

(think of all the OIL we would save) and there's also the benefit of putting money back into the local economy. plus there's something very good about feeling connected to the place you live. you should know where your food comes from.   but. that's all beside the point really.&nbsp;this jar of pickles is from 1998. it's been opened. i'm not sure it's good anymore.

And then cut vertically every few centimeters to make two small slices. Put these slices in a bowl. Pour granola (it's better, to me, if it has raisins.) over the peach slices. Add milk but not as much as you would for, say, a bowl of cereal - just enough to soften the granola. Eat.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  enjoy it.  &nbsp;

       urlLink     (check!)&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  &nbsp;  so. my dad and i have been playing chess. we have maybe, uhm, four games under our belts. it's nice because we're basically on the same level - neither of us use any textbook strategies or algebraic functions to play.  &nbsp;  which is good. because i don't know any strategems or algebraic functions to use against him. i've glanced at a few in our  urlLink hoyle  &nbsp;book. but they don't make enough sense to warrant another look.&nbsp; also in the book are the rules and regulations for chess. including one where if you want to adjust your players you must first say "adjust". if you don't, and you touch a piece, you're in big trouble. there are very specific rules for this game. good thing we don't follow heaps of those rules. (we even allow take-backs. the moving back of a piece if we're very unsure about the move. in the real land of chess you can't touch a piece without moving it and once you move it that's it, buster.)  &nbsp;  but it's a game i've always wanted to know how to play. and now i do. thanks to my dad. that's where you'll find me now.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      So. the gist of this article is:  &nbsp;  A man is creating&nbsp;graffiti by cleaning up.&nbsp;He&nbsp;wipes dirt away with cleaning supplies and old socks and leaves behind&nbsp;messages.&nbsp;Albeit&nbsp;he&nbsp;is sometimes "sponsored" by corporation to&nbsp;leave their symbols&nbsp;thereby advertising for them, he's still not doing much that I can tell is wrong.  &nbsp;  The best part - The Man is trying to stop him from doing this, they're calling it vandalism. But they can't figure out how to bring charges against someone who is wiping away dirt to leave his "tag".  &nbsp;  As he says in the interview:  &nbsp;  "I'm waiting for the kind of Monty Python court case where exhibit A is a pot of cleaning fluid and exhibit B is a pair of my old socks," he jokes.  &nbsp;  (there's an audio link to the radio story. listen.)

      so.   every summer i work for The Man.  urlLink   the Burning Man   .   i can't exactly explain what that means. i can't rightly explain what Burning Man is. one of the best descriptions i've come across describes it as -   "a temporary experiment in radical self-reliance and radical self-expression"   i usually use the words Art, Music, People, Event, Desert, and Community most to describe what goes on. it's hard to pinpoint the feeling of the place.   if you still don't get a good picture check  urlLink   THIS   .   i, along with some damn good people, run the box office.. one of the few aspects of burning man that has to keep their business suits on.. kind of.. we sell tickets and hold tickets for will call.. we handle money and tickets.. we get to meet a lot of the people attending the event.. (which reaches somewhere around 25,000+ each year..)   we're the first cats you see on the playa (that is, if you don't have a ticket already) and hopefully provide the first good experience once your feet hit dirt. we try. sometimes things don't work out. sometimes your name isn't on the list, sometimes you've lost your tickets on 17 hour drive from canada, sometimes you don't have enough cash to buy a ticket. but we try to make stress like that as pleasant as possible.   (although i've had a few nasty run-ins with unhappy folks. i've turned people away. i've had arguments. i've been called a fascist capitalist pig. it's not all candy canes and rainbows, that's for sure.)   but. to explain the photos. before we've rented box office buildings and created our workspace and torn it down over the few weeks we're out on the playa. not this year. this year we've decided to take it on ourselves to create a building we can reuse year after year, a building that's all our own.. and it will definitely feel this way.. because we've built it from scratch.. we started out with a shipping container..   SpinCycle and Thorny cut the windows and designed the overall layout of the place.. not to mention cutting the boards for the floor and countertop..   when i made the trip out to the work ranch, i didn't know exactly what i was getting into.. i was told to wear clothes i would feel comfortable getting lacquered.. i spent the day learning how to do various constructiony things i didn't have a clue about before.   here's a list of things i couldn't do:  1. put a new tube of liquid nails into the liquid nail dispenser thing  2. put a socket on the socket wrench  3. use a screwdriver with my left hand while holding a board up with my right  4. use the right saw terminology. i kept using the wrong descriptors. i don't know jig from skill.   well. i basically demonstrated my complete lack of knowledge for all things construction.   but it was good. it was nice to get out onto  urlLink   the black rock desert   . it was nice to be greeted by metric (sole proprietor and keeper of the burning man ranch).. it was a nice reminder of why i go out every summer and help and work with the bm folks.   but we have a lot of work to do.

       urlLink    (and it has a picture of a train!)  urlLink     i took  urlLink   the train    to san francisco this weekend. left on friday morning, spent all day on the train.. it was great.. i love riding the train.. it's relaxing.. plus they have the observation car where you can sit and watch the scenery go by..  i ate at a vegan restaurant -  urlLink   Herbivore    - on friday night.. my pal Frog is a strict vegan and since i'm.. well.. not...i offered to eat somewhere she would like. and so we went there. and i ate moussaka and we shared german chocolate cake and it was delicious. plus it came with a ginormous salad. it's a nice restaurant (a bit spendy, but it  is  vegan food. so it's sort of expected) and it was hard to choose between all of the different dishes on the menu. but the moussaka had eggplant in it and i love eggplant. i should really learn how to cook with it, but since i don't know how, i try and eat it whenever i get the chance to. so. there's my restaurant experience.  then we went to a bar in her neighborhood and sat at a window table and watched people. we kept seeing these people walking up the street with fake moustaches either attached to or drawn on their faces. all kinds of moustaches. it was awesome. we both decided that a Moustache Party was a good idea.. since it isn't too costumey.. but it's still a theme party.. and there were a lot of good 'staches.. they got pretty creative..  saturday i spent all day at the urlLink    burning man    office.. we went over The Way It Is and talked about new policies and old ones that needed to be reiterated.. that took somewhere around three hours.. and then i had a meeting about radios.. and then my box office folk and i (there were three of us) had a "meeting".. or what i like to call "the rest of the afternoon and on into the evening and near midnight spent talking mostly about relevant stuff but sometimes weaving in and out of stuff that doesn't really matter" it was good. we got a lot of stuff done. i'm excited to get out on the playa and started.  [i'm also nervous. sort of. i have a lot of new responsibilities. and i don't want to screw anything up. this is a big event. a big deal. there are a lot of people that attend. a lot of people have to pick up their tickets at will call. a lot is depending on me. plus we have to finish constructing the damn building before we open it. haha. oh well. i'm sure it'll all go just fine. it seems to do that every year. plus i have a good partner to co-manage the place. and i have some good folks working for me. and my boss is a good guy too. so there you go. surrounded.]  but. back to the story about my weekend. i went to a fundraiser with Frog after the meetings all day. i was kind of apprehensive about it since i was pretty tired from sitting around talking and writing shit down all day. but we went and had a great time. they played heaps of 80's music. it was in a building that was a porn studio. which makes for an interesting atmosphere. the biggest room was done up like a medieval dungeon complete with fake wooden stairs going up to nowhere. it had this funny 80's high school dance theme.. there was a girl Frog knew dressed up like  urlLink   Molly Ringwald    in    urlLink   The Breakfast Club   .. she looked great.. and had the dancing down too.. everything was done by donation only and it looked like they were going to fare pretty well.. i'm interested to see what their camp does at the ol' burning man..  and then. then i rode the train home. and slept most of the way. and got funny looks when i got up to get off at my stop. looks like "you're getting off here? this is out in the middle of nowhere!"  it was good. so. that's where you'll find me now.

       urlLink    (it's where they worship the devil.)  urlLink     my dad and i went up on The Mountain a couple of days ago.. i think we both needed to get some fresh air.. i haven't been up there in a while, and it does rank up there on my list of favorite places.. so we went..  there are a bunch of old buildings up there.. old air force barracks and crap like that..  (i believe that my li'l town was a relay station during world war II.. if the U.S. was going to get bombed, we would send the information from the coast inland.. albeit we aren't exactly  on  the coast, we're close enough. anyway. there are still buildings up there. and old water towers. and radio station buildings that are all locked up.)  when i was growing up here, it was the ongoing urban myth sort of thing that people went up there to worship the devil. which was a scary concept back when i was 13. most of the abandoned buildings have been graffitied to death and there is plenty of evidence of parties and possible glue huffing, that sort of thing.. but no overly satanic business anywhere. but what do i know? i could just be naive about those goings-ons. the abandoned buildings are still scary at night. (remember that mike?) and i've even had a few run-back-to-your-car-oh-my-god-we-are-going-to-get-sacrificed-or-eaten-alive-or-dragged-to-the-underworld-by-ghosts incidents. of course it was my friend Buddy throwing rocks at the buildings. but i swear it sounded like gunshots. i swear.  but of course, like any monster, it's not as scary with the lights on. plus the view is spectacular. nevada's geology/geography is amazing. don't believe me?  urlLink  here's a map.
