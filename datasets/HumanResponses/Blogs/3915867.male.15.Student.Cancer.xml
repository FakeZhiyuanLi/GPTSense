      Well&nbsp;  &nbsp;this morning I was in my room attempting to clean it up when I came across this book that I had bought last year sometime that I had completely forgotten about. Well this book isn't very big or thick and is about all of the stupid laws that people had come up with since like a long time ago and then just forgotten about just like I did with the book.   So from now on I am going to have a new post each day ( if I remember) about a few really stupid laws of the world.  just to give you a taste here are a few that I thought were particularly funny (btw don't bother asking me where a lot of these places are because i don't know): &nbsp;1. in california ownership of a gerbil, hamster or ferret is illegal!!??   2. in colorado it is unlawful to throw shoes at the bride and groom at a marriage ceremony.   3. in australia it is law for taxicabs to carry a bale of hay in the boot.  4. the penalty for masturbation in indonesia is DECAPITATION!!!!   well there you have it jst a taste of some wierd and cooky things that people have conjured up to suit there needs in their particuliar time. who knows someday the thought of giving birth naturall could be illegal in the future!!?!?!?

      well &nbsp;i think i can guess that you are asking yourself "why the fuck did he name his site 'peanutssoeatone' well you see my next door neighbour, prawi woods rite, he is a little strange he has just started calling me 'peanuts' and my brother (as you may already know, ben) 'bonza' (which actually suits him) anyway right i screwed up my last site so badly that i had to re-create this one however i decided to keep all of my posts which is why you may see that they are all out of date with each other anyway so when i decided that i was going to call my site it was actually 'peanuts' but you see that was already taken by some sad fool so i got the inspiration from the subway add when it went 'good, so you don't always have to be' except i decided on 'peanuts, so eat one' not really the same but kinda..
