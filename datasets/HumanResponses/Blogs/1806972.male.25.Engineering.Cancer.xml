      It has been quite some time since I last made any entry in the blog.  Many things happened since then.  Last week, my father passed away. I had to take a week's leave from work, and drove all the way back to KL to attend the funeral.

       Back Home...   I am back home for this weekend (Took a flight, cheaper than a car trip. Although I really like driving along the majestic cliffs of Perak.) Probably, my next trip home will be the end of June, to attend my cousin sister's wedding.   The mid-year monsoon rains have started again. The torrential rain in Saturday afternoon was disastrous! I arrived late for an outing in KL because of traffic jam. The monsoon drains were filling up very quickly. I anticipate tomorrow's news to report flooding on some notorious parts of the Klang Valley.

       Accident!   --# I accidentally deleted half of the blog entry "It was a dark night..." because I wanted to correct an English mistake of the opening verse "Row, row, row you boat". ('you' to 'your'.)  And now I cannot recreate the blog AGAIN! Because I lost the inspiration of the time when I first made the entry.  So, I deleted it... >

      Spending my free time reading a book "The Chinese Dilemma" by Ye Lin-Sheng. It writes about the situation that Malaysian Chinese has to confront one way or another: to accept the racial quota system at the mercy of the Malays or to fight for more equality and freedom as citizens of Malaysia. The author is sympathetic towards the pro-government viewpoint, giving reasons why the Chinese in Malaysia is better off compared to anywhere else on Earth. He did this while admitting that there were failings in the system such as: a 'normal' Malay kid who gains government scholarship compared to a 'smarter' Chinese kid who gets no help from the government to furthur his university education.  A point worth considering: which other country allows Chinese education, Chinese ministers in the cabinet, Chinese cultural flourish and development, Chinese dominance of the economy? There are countries that allow immigration and equal rights, such as the US, European countries... but the Chinese there would have already been "white-washed", they have lost most of their language, vernacular education and cultural development within a generation.  This books makes an interesting reading, as it points out several interesting issues to consider regarding cultural assimilation vs. multiculturalism in the interaction of immigrant citizens and natives.

       Never a dull moment: On the Hit List!  ^.^;;  I just received a phone call from an anonymous caller saying that someone has hired him to assasinate me! Really exciting phone call.  Here is a transcript of the conversation:  Caller:"(cantonese) hey, do you understand cantonese?" Me:"(cantonese) er, yeah, a little..." Caller:"(cantonese) blah blah blah blah...." Me:"(cantonese) wow, gee, I guess I am not that good in cantonese... can you speak something else?" Caller:"(hokkien) how about hokkien, you understand?" Me:"(hokkien) yeah! who are you?" Caller:"don't care who I am... I am here to ask you one question: have you offended anybody?" Me:"er, nope. Nobody." Caller:"let me ask you again: have you offended anybody? because someone has hired me to send you to heaven. If I haven't given you this chance, you are on your way to the burial mound." Me:"I didn't offend anybody, what do you want?" (under my breath: oh yeah, maybe hundreds of people during my debating days... and not to mention several hundreds in Purdue too. heck, this guy doesn't know me.) Caller:"I just want to let you know that you are on the hit list. I know that you are from KL originally, I know you now work in Penang, I have your photo and I know how you look too." Me:"Oh yeah. I see. How much you asking for?" Caller:"Well, you tell me how much you willing to offer..." Me:"Hey... you are the one who wanted the money, you should give the opening price." Caller:"Oh, heck... let's see.... um... RM15,000 (USD 4000)?" Me:"Ha, I can only offer RM2000 (  Caller:"WHAT?! hey, I can't even pay off my Indonesian boys with that..." Me:"Let me give you a call later.... I give a call home, OK?" Caller:"You call back here 10 minutes later..."  That was the first conversation with this guy... there were two other conversations where I gathered my composure and counter-threatened him. But, I called home to talk to my mother first, to know what was going on, because somebody called my mother first, to ask for my information. My mother told that person about my cellphone number and that I work in Penang. So now, I have the pieces of information, I know this guy is just trying to extort money. At least, that was what I thought at that moment. (My home address and phone info were printed on my father's obituary, so I know how he could've contacted my home in KL.)  2nd conversation: (15 minutes later)  Caller:"Hey, why didn't you call me?" Me:"Well, I checked your number, and now I know who you are. Right now, I am sending my boys to finish you off... I guess there is no need for us to talk anymore." Caller:"Huh? What?" Me:"You are on your way to hell. Gong xi fa cai! (this phrase means:"May all the prosperity go to you")" (closed the phone.)  3rd conversation: (1 minute later)  Caller:"Hey, hey, hey, no need to send your boys for me. Let's meet at Komtar (shopping center)." Me:"There's no need for me to go there already. I already know who you are and people are coming for you. We do not need to talk any furthur." Caller:"Oh... no need to talk, eh?" (closed the phone.)  2 police reports were made later that evening. Many thanks to Fook Shian for bringing me to the district police headquarters, and later to the Bayan Lepas police station to submit the report. (We left at 6pm, by the time the investigator finished talking to me at Bayan Lepas station, it was 9pm already... )  In retrospect, here is my advice if you are a victim of an extortion bid: 1) Don't panic. Fear and panic combined reduces IQ to around 28 (pig IQ is around 60). It turns every lion to a lamb, a lamb that willingly submit to the wishes of the extortionists. 2) Consider all the information that he has. Real killers don't expose information --- this will allow the victim to prepare his defenses. Extortion artists, however, use up all the information that he has on the victim to intimidate. Consider where his information comes from, if it is open information, or from a known source, then he is just bluffing. If he has private information that is not contained anywhere else, then that is the mark of someone who has done his homework. (Mark of a true killer, maybe. But it may also be from a hardworking extortionist.) 3) Answer his questions without providing more information that he can manipulate. 4) Try to appear brave. These guys are usually cowards. If you fight back, they will be on the run.  Most importantly, have a light spirit. Take things easily, including your own life. Even if you do meet a real killer, the most important thing is to enjoy every moment of your life. After all, everybody dies in the end! ^^;;

      Now, I am back in my home again for the long Labor weekend.  Work life has begun to sink into me: 1) Repetitive, rigid lifestyle 2) the only thing that concerns working people is about their career, money and their family.  My life's spectrum has shrunk! No time for hobbies and inefficient lifestyle (the kind I had when I was a jobless vagrant)... >  Working life is turning young, healthy people into zombies...

       My first wedding banquet since returning to M'sia.  It has been a LONG time since I last attended a Chinese wedding. So, I am happy and excited to be finally part of it again, because today is the wedding ceremony of my cousin sister. I came back to KL last night for this ceremony.  The ceremony is less elaborate than what was done  urlLink traditionally , in part due to changing circumstances of the modern times. And even among weddings that I had attended 10 years ago are different from today... the customary prayer to the Heavens were neglected this time. I wrote this entry during the afternoon, after the morning ceremony.  What I observed in the morning: 0) House decorated with auspicious items. The family altar lighted and supplicated. 1) Bride makes-up in the bride chamber with her Bride's maids. Since I am from the Bride's family, I just hang around the Bride's house chatting and meeting my relatives. Most, but not all people wear bright colors, especially red --- it signifies the happiness of the occasion. 2) Just before the Groom arrives, the chamber is locked, the bride's maids and female relatives locks the front door and position themselves there. 3) After he comes out with his motorcade, the Groom makes his grand entrance with his best men. Bringing with him a whole roasted pig (uncut) ---- his best men does the carrying, wrapped in red paper, as a present to the Bride's family. 4) Groom and his best men stands in front of the front door, negotiating with the Bride's maids on the conditions of opening the door. (This is when the fun starts. Both sides try to out do each other on the terms of negotiation: In this particular wedding, the Bride's maids offered 10 questions, each wrong answer will entail in eating sushi laced with chilli and horse radish. The outcome was inevitable: the Groom and his best men ate nearly the entire plate of sushi. All of them were sweating and asking for water in the end.) 5) The front door opens at the end of negotiation. 6) The bride chamber negotiation: this time the 'best lady' of the bride will do the negotiation. (This part is also quite funny: the Groom was brought to the fake bride chamber, and he recited his marriage contract and expressed his love for the Bride --- but a male relative came out of the bride chamber, thanking him for the romantic proposal and directed him to the real bride chamber. The Groom has to continue with the negotiation. ^^;;) All the negotiation were done in a good-hearted manner, the point of it is to provide entertainment for the guests. ^_^ 7) Groom enters the bride chamber. Bride and Groom together. Lots of photos taken. Everybody happy.  At this point, everybody takes a brief break, while the Tea ceremony is being prepared.  8) Tea ceremony: Bride's parents sits on a chair, the Bride and Groom will offer them tea. Official change of relationship between the Groom and the Bride's family. Groom will call the Bride's parents as his parents from now on. Red packet with money is given to the Bride and Groom. 9) The older, and married relatives from the Bride's family take their turns being offered tea. Recogition given to the Groom for being part of the family. 10) The Bride and Groom sits on a chair and gives red packet to the younger generation. (I am the first person leading the young people -_-;; I guess this is a strong hint to my present situation. >  After this, everybody takes another break. And then comes the photo session. Almost everybody gets to take photos with the Bride and Groom with different combination of people: by age-group, by family, by gender.  11) The Groom and Bride with their best men and ladies goes to the Groom's house, where the Tea ceremony (step 8-10) are repeated with the Groom's family.  Now, as everybody takes a long break in the afternoon, the Bride and Groom and both their parents are busy preparing for the big evening Banquet --- 10 to 15 course Chinese dinner! Lots of good food will be served, and entertainment provided. Customary for each visiting guests to offer the Bride and Groom red packets as acceptance of the invitation to the banquet.

      Recently there has been a spade of beheadings done by Islamic militants against various intruders into their homelands. Daniel Pierce, Nicholas Berg, and recently Kim Seon-Il, all got beheaded.   In some ways, they became famous for being 'sacrificed' by whatever political situation that existed in the world today (no need to mention what kind of obvious situation... )  It seems barbaric and disgusting to the post-modern viewers of the beheadings (living in rich countries, with sanitised living conditions). (I need to emphasize that I haven't watched any of those videos that have been circulating around the internet, regarding the beheadings >  Interestingly, beheadings have always used to make statements and instill fear since the beginning of human history. Emissaries are beheaded, criminals are beheaded, enemies are beheaded. Their heads placed on marketplaces, city gates, pikes, sent back in boxes.  It may give us the feeling that beheading is a product of the time when humans were less civilized, but even as recent as the 2nd world war, Japanese soldiers beheaded many civilians in Nanjing; in Chechnya, combatants also behead their enemies; Even now, in Saudi Arabia, dangerous criminals are publicly beheaded too.  What used to be the norm in the past justice system and warfare, has now become an intriguing news and terrorist propaganda.

      Haze is back!!! Visibility has been reduced to less than 7km and the air quality sucks. > I can't continue to with my running regimen with this kind of bad air around.  On the other hand, I will back home again next weekend. ^^;; My cousin's wedding banquet will be held next Saturday. So that will my first banquet since coming back from US.

      Back in office on a Sunday. --;; I don't really know what I should be doing back at my apartment, except reading.  I am beginning to get bored of this little island. There's a restaurant at the southern-most part of the island called 'The Beginning of the World', and there is another restaurant at the northern part of the island called 'The End of the World'. This has to be the so-called 'Island Mentality' ---> The islanders' world is only as big as the size of the island.  Installed a water-heater in my apartment yesterday, no more cold-showers in the morning. Warm water... how I miss the feeling. ^_^;; (Although on some really hot afternoons, a cold shower is always the best method to get out of the lethargy and laziness for me...)  Also got myself one of those 'office plants' ---> plants that have gone to through millions of years of evolution to enable them to exist in an office environment. Will install it in my cubicle tomorrow. Hopefully it will lighten up my desk a little. (On the other hand, I hope it won't die through the weekend without water.)

      Got myself a fish tank over last weekend. Put in little fishes in there:  1) Swordtail 4 2) Guppy 4 3) Tetra 6 4) "Algae sucker" 1 5) Small cute algae eater 2  This morning, I noticed one of my swordtails had died over the night. Actually, it was severely sick, it couldn't swim anymore and was stuck to the intake of the water purifier.  Well, in its dying breath, I did to it what I had done to my other 2 Siamese fighting fishes that I had in Purdue (they died of diseases, too) --- I scoped it up and dump it into the toilet. >  Adding to my recent woe, was the fact that I was sick last night. I had "stomach flu". Throughout the night, I had to visit the toilet many times (Almost once every one hour). Slept very little. Woke up tired in the morning, just to see the fish got stuck to the water purifier -_-  Damn.

      This morning, we performed the 100th days ceremony for my father. It was a fine morning. The final rites being over, all that remains is to visit his grave on the anniversary of his demise, and also during Ching Ming (fifth month of the lunar calentdar).

      When polishing a leather shoe, 1) Use a damp cloth to remove dirt off the top and bottom of the shoes. 2) Apply shoe polish wax on a clean cloth and rub it on the shoes.  Surprisingly, it doesn't end here. 3) Use another clean cloth to rub off the polish wax.  Optional ending, 4) Apply water proof wax to protect the leather.  I had always thought it ended at no. 2. ^_^;;  Thanks to my brother for telling me how to do it right.

      I picked up a book that my sister was reading: Jeffrey Archer's  To cut a long story short . In the preface was a very interesting Arab folk tale. I rephrase the story here:   In the city of Baghdad, a merchant sent his servant to the bazaar to get some items. His servant went, and came back later, afraid and on the verge of panic. The merchant asked him what happened.   "I went to the bazaar looking for the stuff that you wanted. Among the crowd, I saw Death threatening me with a frightful gesture. Now, I am scared for my life. Lend me a horse, so that I may travel to Samarra now, where Death will not find me."   So the merchant lent his servant his best horse and bade him farewell. Later, the merchant went to the bazaar to look for Death. She was standing there, when the merchant asked, "Why did you threatened my servant?"   Death replied," I did not threatened him. I turned around and saw your servant, I raised my hands in shock. I was surprised to see him here in Baghdad. Because, I have an appointment with him in Samarra tonight.  This story was humourous in the sense that it reminds us that sometimes, despite our best effort, the inevitable would happen anyway.  Perhaps, it is better for us to take things easily and enjoy life every moment, that when the inevitable comes, we could smile.

      This time, I car pooled with several colleagues to return to KL, to attend a reunion dinner among my (many) cousins. In particular, one of them came from HK, and another just arrived from NY to holiday in Malaysia.  I have been making frequent trips back lately... ^_^;; but after next weekend, I will probably not return to KL as frequently. (because work project is moving at full pace...)  Next weekend is a long weekend, the Chief Minister of Penang's birthday will result in the Monday being a public holiday in Penang. I will be using the opportunity to perform the 100th days Mahayana Buddhist ritual for my father.

      I am spending more time in my job lately. (... and maintaining the fish tank, of course. ^^;; ) That means I have less time to write creative stuff in my blog. Surfing net, I can do only while I am at work. And when I am at work, I seem to have lots of work to do. >.  But I try my best to post when I have the time. Especially on major events. Right now, life is just as usual. Day after day.  By the way, recently, I watched an interesting French movie (with English subtitles... ) called 'Yamakasi'. It is supposedly to follow Kurosawa Akira's  Seven Samurai  and also John Sturges's  Magnificent Seven  (itself a copy of the  Seven Samurai ).  It is about a 7-men team who likes to climb buildings. The plot is straightforward and predictable. But what is unusual is the fact that the 7 men can climb buildings and perform magnificent stunts (real life  Matrix  !). It is interesting just to watch them do their crazy tricks.
