      Time for some humor in your life.       I went to the dentist yesterday. Let me inform you, that my dentist is no normal dentist. To avoid lawsuits, I'll call him "Igor". Now, first I get jumped on by his flunkies (in the medical world they're known as "dental hygienists", but I know better). They probe my mouth, poke it, put little tiny mirrors in it. I suspect they're trying to focus the light at just the right angle as to make my teeth burst into flames. Luckily, all my dental visits are scheduled on cloudy days.      This is mainly due to the fact that I live in southwestern Pennsylvania. You may have heard about it if you live in southwestern Pennsylvania. My area is the meteorological equivalent of the inside of an enormous pocket in a pair of gray sweatpants.      So because of this, I left with all the teeth I came with. But of the worst parts of dental hygienists is that  they have a pathological fear of not giving you X-rays.  You could go in there with dentures and they would  still  insist on giving X-rays, just in case you got some new teeth or something.      Hygienists don't even wait around for the X-rays to happen. First, they put this enormous apparatus in my mouth. Attached to it is what I suspect to be a pure lead insulator ("Heaven forbid anything bad should happen to your teeth"). So as I sit there, sucking lead, she lines up the X-ray gun and set it to "Vaporize".      No, actually she put it next to my mouth and then ran out of the room, probably to a lead-lined bunker some 30 feet underground. I heard a click from the X-ray gun, and, suddenly, I could no longer say for sure whether I had teeth or not. I couldn't even have told you that I had a head.       Seriously, though, the hygienist came back and, get this,  did the exact same thing over again.  I think she put her thumb in front of the lens accidentally, so it looked as if my teeth were under attack by evil forces from the Planet Death-by-Thumb. By this time, my little lead chew was completley disentigrated, and I probably had enough lead in my bloodstream to produce an entire fleet of tanks. So she gave me a new one, hooked up my apparatus, and rushed off to the secret dentist lair once again. This happened two more times.      Then Igor came in. Igor is a special dentist, in the way of being able to make cavities appear in  teeth simply by looking at them . That is why, I firmly believe, that every time I go to the dentist, I always have a small cavity. I'm going in Thursday to get it filled. Maybe I can get some of the lead out of my bloodstream and sell it to him, to save money.

      Alright. I guess since 5/13 of the title is "Music", I should probably mention some music. A couple days ago I staffed a concession stand at the Rolling Rock Town Fair V, in my hometown of Latrobe, Pennsylvania. You may have heard of this show, especially if you live in Pennsylvania, Boston, Seattle, or another city that the Town Fair went to. It was a good show. Except for it sucked. Well, I shouldn't say that. There were about 15 bands there, several of which were smallish, local bands. I found the big trend in these sorts of bands was to stand directly in front of your amp, facing it, start playing, and then (prepare to be overcome with awe), (seriously), kick your feet up behind you like you're trying to kick your own butt. Phew, that was amazing. But in the end it turned out to pretty OK. And by OK, I mean overpriced and too loud. Now I realize it is a music festival, and it is supposed to be loud. But somebody severely screwed up the mixing table and all we could hear from 150 yards away from the stage was this (lean in real close to the screen and I'll give you a sample):  BOOOOM RAKA-TAKA NEEENERERE BOOOOM DA BOOOOM BOOOOM BUM BUM DEE DEE BOOM-SHEEEE-DUM-DUM-DUM..................................ETC.  Notice that you never heard any vocals. That is what I heard all day. But in case you want to read about more here's a link to the Rolling Rock site:  urlLink http://rollingrock.com/LDA.html  (You may have to lie about your age to really get in)

      Hey world. I was reading about blogs in WIRED and all over the place, and i though it would be sweet to have my own. When I needed a topic, I took the two things I know best: music and humor. Hence the title. Well, I'm gonna hit the couch and watch Bill Engvall (humor, see?) on Comedy Central. I feel bad if you don't get that channel.
