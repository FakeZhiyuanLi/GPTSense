      Once again, alone I sit starring at the endless empty pages of the book I am to write. Foreseen by the profits of Xandber; a book that once written will give birth to a new magic. Revealing the Grand Saul, rightful ruler of all lands and water alike. It is not known how long this book has been in existence, it is always called the second book and will be called the second after I am gone. It is said that every 500 years the book erases its pages, but not before showing the next who will write in its pages. Once the Grand Saul reads from it's pages a force from the stars erupts around his body lifting him into the sky transforming his body aging him wisely and will live for four hundred years. The one posses the power to truly free our land of the tyrant Goggma.  Twenty-five years have past since I was told that I would write the new Book of Creation. In twenty-five years I have not wrote one solitary page. Rumors came before my birth, my people celebrate my birth every 13th passing of the second moon. My burden weighs more with each passing day. Every year I tell my brothers and sisters it is closer to being done, and life's are lost every time Goggma and his henchmen come to collect our crops and beat and murder and rape. They come in search for me, the writer of the second book, the Book of Creation.  Six months before I was born, the Grand Saul died, one day after that Goggma and his foul stench filled our trees, as he and his army burned our village to the ground. It wasn't just my village he burned, all the villages, all of my people all of the Sanmo people. Many have died, sacrificed their lives to spare mine. Twenty five years, not a drop of ink has touched the pages of our oldest most sacrade book.  My name is Kankto, son of Firton. I live deep in the forest of Xandber, hidden by the magic of the oldest of our profits Zebular my teacher and guardian. The small stone house, this house was not a regular house, nor was it just a house. It was built into the side of a hill covered in vines and flowers so a wanderer will not see what is really here. Should someone take notice to this place and wander to close, the magic of Zeb will cause them to forget where their going or what they have seen and turn them around back in the direction they were coming from. None but the prophets know of my location.

      I am sick of being poor! So, tomorrow when I am a rich writer, I'll be happy, finally. Well, so what if eventually I will have to crush people and shove them down toilets to get what I want, so be it!&nbsp;   If I end up not being a writer, at least, I will say one day you know what I had a good life, no, wait, I better get rich somehow, even if I have to Lie, cheat, and steal to get it! Cause my life is rather dull, plain, ordinary, not ordinary, but defiantly plain!   Maybe I'll move to California and be an actor, open casting calls are in the newspapers there I hear! Podunk Kansas don't have nothing like that, here your either a farmer, oil digger, teacher, or everyone else! Those everyone else's out there are struggling to make a freaking buck working in stupid factories with incentives to buy from your place of employment. Hmm, your already getting paid so little why would you give your money back to your employer! Those corporate freaks got rich, because they are forcing you and me to buy stuff we don't need. All those commerials on TV, advertising, brain washing you into thinking that Pepsi and Coke are the only too good cola products out there.  At one point we had three TV channels, now there are thousands all brought you by satellite dishes, and there is still nothing&nbsp;good on TV. What happened to shows like&nbsp;ALF. Everyone loved Alf. I guess he finally got a talk show.&nbsp; Oprah you better step your show up a notch! Oh and you better make sure you have digital camera too, you want to make sure have what everyone else has. Its ok be a follower, lets all fall off the edge of our flat planet, into the darkest pits of HELL!~

      Well first, lemme say it was a very pleasant trip to Parsons, I&nbsp;had a friend of mine go with me. I am&nbsp;positive that Joey was laughing at me the whole time! I mean he even told his girl about the whole situation, I herd&nbsp;him whispering on&nbsp;his&nbsp;cell&nbsp;Phone while talking to her "I will tell you about it when&nbsp;we&nbsp;get back"&nbsp; Hmmm...  Now I don't want to sound mean at all cause&nbsp;I am really not very good at being mean.&nbsp;If I do sound mean don't hold it against me! So&nbsp;I am going to apologize for it before it happens, I am sorry!   Before Joey and I&nbsp;left for&nbsp;Parsons I talked to my internet friend and mentioned&nbsp;bringing a camera, she said no pics of her in her uniform, so&nbsp;basically&nbsp;I said I'll try to&nbsp;edit out the uniform, unfortunately,&nbsp;The one&nbsp;Picture I wanted to use had to have the uniform since&nbsp;I wanted to use&nbsp;the whole picture.&nbsp;I tried blurring&nbsp;it out a little hopefully it don't look too bad.   So when&nbsp;me and Joey got there, I conveintantly didn't&nbsp;tell my waitress who&nbsp;I was even though&nbsp;I guessed she&nbsp;had some inclinations&nbsp;as&nbsp;to who&nbsp;I was!  That's when&nbsp;Joey&nbsp;started saying you better tell her who you are or&nbsp;I will!  Ha so I did. She was like I thought it was you but I didn't want to sound retarded if it wasn't you. HEHEHE....   Shes a really good waitress though, food was pretty good and&nbsp;the internet girl was really nice.&nbsp;And Shy.   Truthfully she wasn't what&nbsp;I expected, but&nbsp;she wasn't the worst case senerio that&nbsp;I had already planned on meeting.   I guess she told other co workers that she was having an Internet GUY come in (ME). So they were giving her a hard time about the situation. Saying that she was going to get kidnapped. And this and that! She also said that she was thinking about switching name tags with another girl that worked there. She said she decided not too... although who knows she still might have!&nbsp;   In the future though, I want to express strong caution on meeting people off the internet, seriously&nbsp;you never know who your meeting.&nbsp;So public places are the safest especailly in the day light hours.  Will&nbsp;I&nbsp;ever meet another&nbsp;Internet girl? Probably! Joey and I was talkin about maybe continuing online meeting and I can post my stories here for anyone to read. Even though now no one actually reads it!   Internet girl if you read this,( I am only calling you that because you don't want your real name posted), it was nice&nbsp;meeting you, I hope you liked the tip!&nbsp;

      Recently I met a girl Online and today I am going to Pizza Hut in Parsons to find out who she really is! I have talked to this girl several times online and she seems Normal! I am sure she is, but I can't help but wonder.   Once before I met a girl online&nbsp;but she&nbsp;actually came to see me in a play that I was in.&nbsp;And ended up dating her for about 6 months... And that my friends, was a catastrophic mistake, the wake from that relationship still hasn't completely leveled off. That girl seemed normal at first, Then I noticed little things that she'd tell me that would be different from the first time, but I blew it off as simple exaggeration. Then later on in the relationship she became VIOLENT, I blamed it on stress, Then she started waking up crying, that's when I got supsicous, I am a pyschology major, and I new that it wasn't NORMAL. Of course I didn't attempt to diagnose her, but our relationship ended shortly after!   Hopefully I meet a nice normal person tonight, and hopefully I gain a new friend!&nbsp; Keep watching my site for PHOTOS of the Internet girl!

      Today I got a phone from a friend of mine and he was telling me that he doesn't think he is going to vote for John Kerry anymore. I asked why? He said Because Kerry's boreing and doesn't really intrest him now.  Well ain't that a load of crap! Although I can't blame him, John Kerry is a boring looking guy. I have got a feeling this election isn't going to go as well as america wants. If it don't go the BUSH wants then maybe he can call up a re count in Florida again.  I DON'T WANT BUSH AS MY PRESIDENT ANYMORE!

       This morning I woke up to the sound of my stupid old neighbor mowing her lawn.... It was like 8am. Who gets up that earlier? So now I am going to be in a cranky mood all day.     &nbsp;   Well, last night I watched the O'Rilley Factor, and Michael Moore really kicked some ass.&nbsp; Moore was very consistent about saying George Bush is a lair! Will O'Rilley says well Bush was just informed about weapons of mass destruction. Moore made a very good point though, I can't remember exactly what he said but it was along the lines of if anyone else told a lie due to being misinformed that person would be DUBBED a liar!~    I don't like our president, I didn't when the last election came around, I even remember telling some people that the guy sounds like he wants to go to war durning the last elections.     John Kerry, isn't really that much different than George Bush as far as what he wants to do right NOW, but one thing about Kerry, he&nbsp;is plans to keep forces in IRAQ, isn't something that he wants to do, he would have to&nbsp;fix the&nbsp;mistakes made&nbsp;by bush, cause it would be stupid to remove our troops now!     &nbsp;   To me the Iraq situation is getting worse and not better. Those loser chicken shitted&nbsp;cum bubbles of terrorists are pretty damn stupid, what the heck our they fighting for? Are they wanting to be the future controllers of the oil rich country? Fu*k em' lets hire hitman or special forces or what ever other small group of ANTI-TERRORISTS to go and terrorize the terrorists...Hey we could even call them the A-team! Ha     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      Is it really inconceivable that Robots will eventually take over, or actually I should say TRY to take over our world? Is it possible that one day we will have robots managing our needs so that we the people of earth can sit on our asses and play video games indoors staying out of the sun to avoid skin cancer and the West Nile viruses. Could it be possible that our Creator was an engineer and built us kind of like we build things? Could that creator have been a Robot himself. How would a metallic senescent creature see our flesh? Meatbag maybe? What do we see as the skin of a robot? Tin can maybe? Has there been fleshy's vs. The alloys in our hidden past? Does this sound so far fetched that it could never be possible?   I mean after all, bible readers all know that we were "created" to "serve" god. Is that something that I shouldn't say? Do I sound ignorant by saying what I have said? My real question is: What makes you so sure of anything? Proof you say? Ancient proof?&nbsp; How many times has "proof" been learned to be wrong? I&nbsp;can't really say one way or the other, I think if you think about it to hard it will drive you right off a cliff to certain doom.      One thing that seems like it is always true regardless of time and space and location and that is what begins eventually will end. Just like I have just finished my writing for now!

      Today is not the day I thought it would be, that I can say true. However I get to finally go see IROBOT ya! I probably wouldn't have gone to see it, but I watched the orange county coppers epsiode when they made an irobot chopper and lemme say it was awesome!  &nbsp; &nbsp;Hey Gariet If your reading this&nbsp;and you don't want this site posted let me&nbsp;know asap&nbsp;cause i'll take it down.&nbsp;But really who's going to be reading this anyways. Its not&nbsp;like&nbsp;I have some kind message to get out to people or a fan following for that matter. But for chance someone stumbles there way to this page&nbsp;please leave messages, I am really enjoying my new hobby of posting&nbsp;blogs and for anyone that likes art or&nbsp;produces art your going to like this website I was there and lemme say the are is&nbsp;different from what&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;I would, my only question was whos stuff is who's. I only ask cause this site is a group of artists that do art together and&nbsp;they all post their stuff at the same site. I think&nbsp;this is an uber coolio&nbsp;idea. Hey maybe&nbsp;I can send out some of my arty pics i've taken over the last few months and get them posted, ah maybe not&nbsp;i am not part of any synidacte. hehehehe.&nbsp; urlLink www.bancroftsyndicate.org &nbsp;  &nbsp; In other news, John Kerry's wife makes a blunt statement about George Bush saying, "George Bush is unamerican", then moments later plays dumb to a reporter and says, "It wasn't me" ha the words of Shaggy's once popular song...

      So, I finally ordered the right video card for my computer from  urlLink newegg  and supposedly the fedEx guy should be here by 4pm with the card. I really am getting restless about its arrival. Yeah its not the greatest video card, but it should be alot better than what i have now. I only have PCI slots so my choices were limited. Yeah I found out that my computer (the one I spent and ass load of money on) isn't very upgradable. (rolls eyes)  Anyways, now I am planning on building my own so that I know exactly what is in my system, plus its cheaper than building a CAR!

      Well, the last couple of days has been interesting to say the least.  A friend of mine talked me into buying CITY OF HERO's an online super huge game, thats preety awesome from what I have seen.  But what I haven't seen is the big problem.  Frist off let me say my computer is only like 7months old if that. Its a freakin decent computer pentium 4, 512mbRam, 64bit video, big hard drives, lots of usb ports and all that. So it would seem that I should be able to play all these computer games. Aparently NOT! I bought the game installed it, it took like 1 1/2 hours or so. Then I had to create an account before I could play. Then I finally get to start it up and low and behold there is no picture. MY stupid internal video card is freaking not compatible with the game. I took a deep breath, considered taking the game back and forgeting about it, then thought well if I ever want to play other video games I should get a new video card and then i can play CITY OF HERO's well, I bought one online, before realizing I need to have an APG or AGP or something kinda slot in my computer. Of course I didn't have one. So, I am screwed twice over one game so far...I bought a game I can't play, a video card I can't use, and to top it all off my 30 day free trial of the games is slowly wasting away.

       Well it's Sunday again! I am at work right now as I type this; Working very hard as you can see! Its 8am, I am tired, and I only got 11 more hours to go!   One week until my birthday, soon I will be an OLD man!      Someday, I'll get grey hair, I'll get wrinkles, and my prime will be long gone. I wonder if I will be a grumpy old man. Talking crap about how the younger generation has ruined everything and remember the good old days. Or, will I be envious of all those who are youthful, just as I am youthful now. Will I try to follow the trends of the young to make myself feel less old? Will my views of what's acceptable change? Will I try to do the things I once enjoyed when I was younger and break a hip? Will I be 50 yrs. old and hang out in bars or clubs and actually think that the young women actually like me and not the drinks I buy for them? Is it really going to be like what they say, and one day I'll just looked in the mirror and realize my youth is gone and all I have to look forward to is the bright light at the end of the tunnel? And what mirror will it be? The rear view mirror of my car, the mirror in the bathroom, or will it be my reflection on a giant glass door in front of something like a wal-mart. Will I still feel like I do right now, that I can accomplish anything? Will I even remember who I used to be, will I remember the person I am now? Will I get botox injections?      Now, it seems those days are so far away, but the first twenty something years of my life went pretty fast, now let me see how fast the next 20 some odd years go by. And let me see what I can accomplish before its to late to find out.

      It's been several days since my last post, I am sure that my readers have been upset with me due to the lack of updated posts. So at last, without any further waiting here it is.  As you all know I recently bought a video game, then I had to buy a new video card to play the game, finally it arrived and its now installed and Seriously, I have been playing it none stop for the last few days. So far the longest straight play time has been 10 hours! Can you imagine 10 HOURS sitting at a computer! It must be a good game right? Well it is a very good game. City of Hero's is awesome. My super hero's are XPULSION and Dr. Van Trossle. The Dr. Is a magically enhanced woman with the power of ice and storm. So far she's my main character. I know what your thinking why would I play as a girl? Well, for one thing its a game! Number two its just a game!

      So, school started. Blah! And, guess what time it is? 1 am and its a school night YAY!  So what am i doing up so late on a school night you might ask... I just got back from Pittsburg Ks. I went to visit a friend of mine that recently moved up there.  I went to a bar called something like 311, but it was neatO. It just happend to be thirsty thursday and tonights speacial was Bud Light Slim Jim's... it was bud light alright but nothing slim about it as it was about three beers in ONE giant MUG. Plus they had 25 cent pool, there is nothin that beats that. Well, except i got my ass kicked a couple times, but it only cost a quarter!  Algebra, 9am isn't that some SHIT!  I have to take it though, stupid icc requirements. I almost took a class on fiction, well it requires that I buy and read all tweleve of the books selected by the teacher. 12 books is alot, well, not really it is just hard because I would be forced to read those books. The problem is that i would probably like the books. Then I wouldn't get to play video games as much. Oh i am babbling ... bable bable bable bable bable blabe bable bable bable bable.... oh sorry  GOOD NIGHT
