       the main issue on my mind at the moment is whether or not to have another cup of coffee. I had a cup yesterday, and have had a cup today. Is a second cup valid???? Normally i have three cups in the morning, but after being sick on Friday night, i feel it is better to leave it for a while - seems to upset my delicate tummy a wee bit. No, I will have a slurp of milk instead. Yesterday the building work from next door annoyed me so much that i grabbed a deck chair, my hat, sunglasses and my books and went off to sit in the country park to get on with my study. Didn't do much, of course, but it is the thought that counts. It was peaceful - I found a spot on a hillside, overlooking the bizarre mix of countryside and oil refinery - strange combination, but it has the look of a 60's sci-fi movie about it - i love that view. It looks unbelievable on a misty morning - the countryside obscured by a gentle mist, and the domes and pipes of the refinery float in the stillness of their shrouded habitat.  Came home, went to the garden, dug up some carrots, picked an onion, and made carrot soup. It really was delicious! Put a portion in the freezer, and have another portion for today. Tip: for storing soup in the freezer - put it in a container first, cause otherwise it spills over everything else. More sensible tip: Pour and Store bags! these little plastic bags are quite sturdy - when you open them up, the base splays out so the bag stands upright, allowing you to pour soup in without spillage. Then seal the bag and pop it in the freezer. You can, of course, reuse the bags - just give them a wee wash and they are ready to use with another batch of whatever delightful liquid you have ready for storage. Well, I think that really is enough of my ramblings for today. I will go and check whether the amazing paint removal product has had made any difference to the paint stains on my shorts, and then get on with a bit more reading today.

       Friday morning. I slept well last night - didn;t wake up until 7.30am!!!! that is such an improvement - previously i have been waking at 5. Yesterday was a bit of a lazy day - felt a little unsettled, so just pottered around, went into town, bought a head cleaner for the video, oh, and wandered round the new amazing Asda/Walmart!!! Imagine - off you go to do your shopping.... making mental notes - I need, milk, eggs, a bicycle, a wide screen telly, some pasta, a sofa etc. Amazing! These places never seem to amaze me! I find it so interesting to see what people have in their trolleys. I wonder sometimes, if people can cook at all - it seems that ready meals, prepared ingredients etc are so readily available, that there is no need to ever cook! How will this affect the general population? In contrast, last night i went into the garden to pick dinner - a little salad, all from fresh ingredients, grown in my own soil, tended with my own fork and trowel... hmmm. I had wondered a while ago, whether it would be possible to live only on seasonal produce from local suppliers for a whole year. I would love to try it, but to be honest, there are so many things that i have come to rely on which cannot be sourced locally - pasta, for example. As far as meat and veg is concerned, well, a visit to the farmer's market would take care of my needs there, but how would i deal with chocolate???? Hmmmm maybe one day, I will give it a go.  Ok.. i am off now. Those are just a few of my thoughts for today, and i need to get myself motivated for a study day... books ALL day today!! no excuses... nope.. not one.. no procrastination..none at all..... no.... really..ok.. gone now

       well, it was an eventful day! - well, as eventful as it gets. Drove to visit my aunt - the journey was prolonged by the unnecessary traffic. Unnecessary, cause of a series of accidents round the M25, long tailbacks etc. But, I survived, listening to a combination of Classic fm and Radio 2.  Got home, got a letter from S. Really nasty - I know the guy is ill, but there is no need for him to take it out on me. I feel used! Still, the end of a 23 year friendship. Sad, but there you go.  As for today - Thursday (I think) - will get on with the studying today - i really need to get a boatload of reading done in the next day or two, so will set up all my books in the conservatory - would sit in the garden, except it was raining last night. It might brighten up later, and if it does, I will sit outside - of course, that also depends on the neighbours - they are building next door - it is a noisy affair!!!! I will be glad when they finish!  Ok, in case anyone is reading this, I really would like a harp. If you feel you could buy me one, then please get in touch.  later!

       I can't believe it is so long since  I last posted! My goodness, it must be at least half an hour! And so much has happened in that time. The story so far. I woke up at 6.56 this morning - that is quite late for me, as i have a tendency to wake up around 5. The usual pattern for the morning is to go downstairs, flick the button on the coffee machine, which has already been set up the night before (tiredness early in the morning cause spillages of coffee grounds, setting it up the night before saves valuable minutes, and allows for a more exacting execution of the coffee process), sit in the conservatory and have a cigarette, flop back up to bed with the coffee and switch on the computer. After a brief check for non-existant e-mails, and a cursory glance at the words of the day, I check into the chat room, so see if anyone is there. Normally there isn't - ah well, never mind. Morning chats have become a habit - whether it is with friends on icq, or in the chat room. That habit began about 6 years ago - although at that time, I had to physically get out of bed and walk the long route to my study. Now, in a fit of laziness, I use my lap top in bed. Luxury! I do like my bed. It is a comfortable place to be. Recently, I painted my bedroom - white! Also, I reorganised the wardrobe, and cleared out all the clutter. A difficult task, but i am so happy to be here now - uncluttered, unfettered, and cosy. Downstairs has also been painted - i wanted a light bright and airy space, so painted the walls white there as well, and added a nice new carpet - a pale green - very soothing and restful.  Days are slow and leisurely at the moment. I have another week or two before i have to go back to work, but still have so much to do in the meantime - mostly studying, writing up a research project. It is lovely to have the time to just sit and read, and get up every so often to wander round the small garden, dead-heading the cosmea, or doing a little light weeding. Last night, I went out there to pick dinner -  a little lollo rosso, some carrots and tomatoes and cucumber to make a light salad.  The lettuce is doing well - i have had a very good crop this year. I have also eaten some of my own potatoes and onions. Tomatoes always tend to do well here - i have 4 varieties - tumbler in a hanging basket, Gardener's delight - a good standard tomato, plum and beefsteak - this is the first time i have tried these. The plum has a more bushy habit than the others. I will use it to fill the freezer with soups and pasta sauces for the winter. The beefsteak tomatoes are good at bbqs - stuffed with a mix of breadcrumbs (to soak up the juice) , goat's cheese and herbs - delightful!  The sweetcorn is coming up well - this is the first time i have tried it - just 8 plants. The cobs are forming well now, and i am looking forward to picking them.  But enough of the garden, I need to get dressed and disappear off to visit my aunt today. Then, this evening, I will sit and watch telly.... luxury!

       good morning to all my readers - well, that means me and maybe one other. This is my first little foray into the blogging world - in truth, i only found out what a blog was a few minutes ago, so let's see how it goes.  Will this be a cathartic experience? or a trivial pursuit? we will just have to wait and see!
