      I want a new car...well maybe not new. But I definitely want another car. My grandma bought another car yesterday...a 2001 Mercury Sable. It is silver. That is very important to note. Her current car is a Sunfire that is bright purple. I am not making this up. I have never seen another car in that color. She got it used, so she didn't pick the color. But wow, what a color. It looks like Barbie's Dream car.  There is nothing wrong with my mighty Escort. It works, it does what it's supposed to. But it isn't a car that represents me. My car should look cool. It should have a lot of power. The Escort doesn't look cool....it is ok looking but nothing that stands out. It is also green. I am not a green person...people are surprised when they find out I drive a green car...it doesn't fit. Unfortunately my money situation is not at a state where I can buy another car. I need a real job first. And I am saving up to move out because the most important thing is to be out on my own. But when I get my act together, the car will be next.

      My laptop is not working. It has been having the same problem for months now, the ac adapter/battery are not working properly. I was always able to get it to function ok, but now it seems to have rebelled to a point where it doesn't want to cooperate. So I am having power management issues. Fun. I am going to get a regular computer soon so I dont have to deal with this. I have to bum computer time from other people. Well I am off to Olive Garden...yay.

       urlLink AbsoluteMadonna.com - The re-Invention Tour 2004   So last night I went to see Madonna at MSG, on her Reinvention Tour. It was a great concert. There was a lot going on, both visually and musically. The performers were excellent. They did all sorts of things. There were bagpipes, a halfpipe, cages, and lots of other things. She sang a lot of the old favorites and gave a new twist on them. The biggest change to me was Deeper and Deeper, going from a dance song to a ballad. She sang my theme song, Material Girl, and some of my other faves like Into the Groove (with a Missy Elliot rap prerecorded for it) and Crazy for You (which she dedicated to the fans). Some of the visuals were odd...she was definitely protesting Bush during American Life. She did a great cover of Imagine. Other good ones were Like a Prayer, Frozen, and Papa Don't Preach. They had new elements that made them different than just the straight up versions I am used to, but they were all recognizable and singalongable (hey I just made up a word). She ended the Concert with Holiday, which was decent but not one of the highlights. It was an awesome show and she is an outstanding singer and performer. She is in such great shape and knows how to get the crowd into it. I do have to take some points off though because she didn't sing my favorite song, Human Nature. But overall, I would highly recommend it. And I am not even a big Madonna fan...I like her music, but I am definitely not a diehard like some of the peeps I saw last night.

      Seriously. No one ever emails me. It is so depressing. I open my email, and find ZERO messages. The cycle repeats. I mean, yeah I already talk to the people I want to talk to, but it would be nice to get an email now and then.

       urlLink SeaWorld Orlando   Well I booked Seaworld for myself and Margherita as one of our activities in Florida. I am looking forward to it, considering the last time I was there, I was 7. I do remember seeing Shamu though, and playing in this pool with some playground equipment that is probably long gone because it is definitely unsafe for children. Kids have it so easy these days-they don't get the dangerous playground equipment like my friends and I had to play on. Wow I sound really old when I say that. Seaworld is going to be excellent. I also booked some snorkeling equipment when we are in the Bahamas on the cruise ship's private island. Now we have to figure out what else we are going to do, but the rest of the time we are trying to do things with my family. Should be a blast :)

      Margherita went to 711 tonight to buy scratch offs. She won $50+ dollars and she only spent $16. Not a bad rate of return but I wouldn't buy scratch offs or lottery tickets. I gamble on the stock market....not on games of chance. There is skill involved in buying and selling securities. It is a much more calculated risk, not just blind luck.  I also noticed that full cartons of cigarettes are like $50. That is such a waste of money. I have never seen the appeal of it-I've never even tried to smoke. Ever. It is nasty and does nothing. I don't really drink and have never done any drugs. I guess it just seems like everyone does these things, or has done them, or will be doing them. So maybe I am a deviant. But I like it that way...I don't lead, I don't follow, I just do my thing.

      So my brother Robert graduated from high school yesterday. He is the last of us to get out of high school. It was the usual graduation thing, lots of speeches, telling you that you can achieve anything, to always be true to your friends, etc...the same old stuff just presented differently. All the speakers did well, but none of their messages was new. But that is good. It is familiar. We expect that from the speakers...go with the tried and true. Rarely do people venture out into new territory. Gradauation really isn't the time for radical new ideas, or to speak your mind. It is about comforting people who are going out into unfamiliar territory. One last ritual ceremony before being thrown out into the scary new territory of a new world.  Last night, after graduation, I went with my friends Margherita and Andrea, along with Robert to see  Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story . It was really funny and had some unexpected laughs. Definitely better than I thought it would be.   Today I went to see my other friend April's new house. Her family moved into a big new house, after living in a small apartment for a couple of years. She didn't even have a bedroom before this. Now she has a huge room downstairs, big enough to have a bedroom and a lounge. Good for her. She actually has closets now. I am happy for her....it is going to look great when it is all set up. Her mom and she have already done some nice things with the place...it is great to see them in such a nice place.

      So I am going on a  cruise  in August. We are going to Florida and the Bahamas. It should be fun. My only concern is the activities. There are several activities we can preregister for at each stop. They all look really interesting, however, no one has the same tastes as me. I want to do new and interesting things, but why do I feel like I will be doing the same old stuff? I know that compromise is in order, but I think I am the one who is going to be doing all the compromising.

      I can't even keep my nail polish from getting chipped for one day. My french manicure is messed up now. Oh well, the whole spa manicure/pedicure experience is so worth it...my hands, arms, legs and feet look and smell great. I don't even care much about getting nail polish on, but it is part of the process.  My mom and I saw  Stepford Wives  today. It was ok. It had its funny moments, and the plot was interesting. I have never seen the original movie or read the book but I thought this one was decent. I wish I had a Stepford husband who would do everything for me. Stepford friends and family would be nice too.

       urlLink BRAVO > Queer Eye for the Straight Guy    I love Queer Eye! I wish that five gay men would come and make me over.  Unfortunately, I am a chick. They are developing Queer Eye for the Straight Girl, however, it is based out of LA. A little bit of a commute to NJ. I live right in current Queer Eye territory, but the only way I will get on it is if I get a sex change operation. Sad. But man, these guys are amazing. I have rethought a lot of what I have been doing and what I will be doing. I am more aware of how I am taking care of myself. I am dressing better and in more colors (I was previously known as 'the one who only wears black'). I am plotting the design of my future home and will definitely use a few Thom tricks to decorate. And like I said, I want to learn how to cook. Before Queer Eye, I would have never even thought that, but now I am actually making an effort to cook. Ok, so all I cook is Minute Rice and pasta but it's a start. And Jai has opened me up to new ideas-both cultural and social. I am getting interested in things I have never even cared about before. The guys have made such a positive impact on my life and I see myself continuing to improve in all areas of my life.   Of course change is a process and it can take awhile. Sometimes I backslide. But I know I am constantly improving myself. I wouldn't say I owe it all to Queer Eye, but they have certainly enlightened me to a better path. For example, I am wearing a 3/4 length sleeve baseball shirt that is yellow and navy. Yellow has never found a way into my closet, and I have always considered 3/4 length sleeves to be indecisive. But here I am wearing something totally against what I have worn in the past. I am getting a manicure and pedicure today, something I would have never even thought to do. And I am going to enjoy it.

      I am always hungry. There is never any food in my house. At least, there is no food that I can eat. I am a vegetarian. But I am not an extremist. I just don't eat meat. You would think that there would be a plethora of options for me. But there aren't. I just want some simple food that I can cook for myself. I need an easy vegetarian cookbook. I am definitely not into spending hours in the kitchen, but I would like to cook something a little fancier than just pasta or english muffin pizza. Eventually, I will prevail over the stove. Food mastery will be mine.

      So this is my first blog. How cool is that? Right now I am off from work, just hanging out. I am going to get a manicure and pedicure later. Fun Fun. I figure I have to take better care of myself and pamper myself every once in awhile. I deserve it. I am also going to the movies, my mom wants to see either Garfield or Stepford Wives, so I said I would go with her. I am a big slacker these days, I barely work and am not attemtping a job search yet. I figure that I have to wait until mid July because I am going on a cruise in August so I can't start a job until then anyway. Oh well. I am happy to have the time off and am definitely enjoying myself.

      I am lightheaded today and I have a feeling of being a little out of it. My head hurts just slightly and I have no appetite.  It is raining....didn't do much today. Watched a bootleg copy of Fahrenheit 9/11 that my dad bought from some guy on the street. It was a decent dub but not exactly great. Still F9/11 really gave me some things to think about

      I am so lost without my laptop, which looks like it is never going to get fixed. That stinks....maybe in a few months I will either get a new computer. I don't know, I can't afford it right now....I need to make some money.  Lately things haven't been going as planned, but oh well. My financial situation and life situation will change soon. The cruise is coming up fast, all I have to do is pack. I have everything I need.  My mom and I want to start our own business. I hate working for other people. In general, I am antisocial...I would rather not associate with other people. Cause most of them are stupid and annoying.

      Ok so yesterday was the 4th of July. Of course, working can put anyone in an unpatriotic mood. You realize that a lot of your fellow Americans suck, and you are not proud to be living in a country with so many rotten people. You realize that the fundamental values of America are greed and lying. You realize that you are one of the few good people in this country, along with some of your friends and family. And it is sad. This has the potential to be an even greater country than it is, but it is screwed up and has a long way to go. There needs to be massive change in our attitudes and values. Oh well. I am not an activist and I am not taking on the responsibility of changing this place. I am just going to be the best I can be.  I saw fireworks yesterday. The display was ok. I am not a big fan of fireworks....you've seen one, you've pretty much seen them all. And I hate crowds of people, especially stupid ones like the ones that were watching with me. Seriously, why do you take your rotten two year olds with you when you know they will get scared? Wait until they are older...I don't want to hear them whining and crying. And why are you taking your dog? I don't think dogs like loud noises...I know my dog doesn't. Anyway, I like when they shoot off like 85 fireworks at the same time. One or two at a time just doesn't do it for me. I like big explosions of color and sound. All fireworks displays should be like that-nonstop explosions of many fireworks at the same time. None of that wimpy one at a time stuff.

      I am definitely going through computer withdrawal. My online time is so diminished, I barely am on at all anymore...it is so weird. I am an internet addict for sure, I feel so weird not being able to go online whenever I want to.   In other news...I am having a bad luck spell. I think someone put a curse on me. I have always been naturally clumsy, but this is unreal. On Wednesday, I spilled chocolate milk all over my kitchen, dropped my pizza on the floor and slammed my finger in my car door, all in the span of an hour. Yesterday at a restaurant I spilled my soda all over the table. I tripped over a rug today and have been just constantly banging into things or dropping things. It sucks. My coordination has took a nosedive. Not that I would ever be named Ms. Graceful, but it is getting out of hand. Someone is going to get hurt-probably me.
