      I enjoy these blogs for personal revelation.  For instance, I enjoy plants.  Plants of all kinds.  Flowers especially.  I recently purchased a few small house plants, an antique potting bed, and some moss.  I took these and put together a pleasant little ensemble.  I know this sounds really soft, but actually I found it relaxing and enjoyable.  If I won the lotto, I would buy four things after taking care of friends and family.  A restaurant, a golf course, a flower shop, and a gym like Average Joes.   Ok, who am I kidding?  The gym would be way more extreme than Globo-Gym, except without the supplements and plastic surgery.  And also with way more shiny vests (Jack?....Joel?).

      So I stop a car the other night and it is this gangbanger dude driving.  So, I put all my lights on the car so he can't see me walk up and I walk up on the passenger side so he can't see me.  He is looking out the driver's window and I am standing at the passenger window.  I am about to ask him for his license when I see the back end of a  handgun sticking out from between the cushions of the driver and front passenger seat.  So I take my gun out and tell the guy to put his hands on the steering wheel and not move. He looks at the gun and goes to reach for it... I then told him not to move and he said... I just want to show you its a B B Gun.  I put my finger on the trigger when he moved and shit myself After the TURD fell down my pant leg. I politely asked him again not to move and to get out and lay face down on the ground.  So I go check the gun then, and it is an all metal BB gun which is painted all black and has all the functioning parts of a gun, only bb pellets instead.  The guy then told me that he figured something like this would happen if he kept the gun right there, but that he only keeps it there for protection from the rival gangs.  I don't know why people think like that.

      Bagel - it is bullshit that you finally get me to come down to Champaign to hook up with you on a daily basis a la Courtney Potempa in high school and then you ditch me.  WHATEVER.  Todd - Way to still be friends with Bert.  NOT COOL AT ALL.  Whitey - That's cool that you almost shot someone.  Remember when you almost stabbed Chairman in your full police regalia?  You don't!?  Well it's a good thing that I have pictures!   Landon - Sweet hair.  Don't cut it before I see you in Chi-city or else!  Also, I have a present for you.  Remind me about it, or I will totally forget.  I am serious this time, you!  Also, I am still not telling you how I know about SPLEEM or PEEM.  Who else is on this blog?  Ah, fuck it, I will just update you dudes on what is going on with me:  Pretty much a lot of relaxing and getting sweet tattoos.  I finished my tattoo last week.  It still has a couple of scabs on it, but when those shits fall off I will post a picture for all to see.  I also am writing up a brief schematic for the workers revolution, while listening to the Internationale.  It's raining like a (little) bitch here today, or I would be on a bike ride.    If you want to see a sweet picture of Jack and I in vests from '99 Hilton Head, check out  urlLink Hansel.   Stas- Congrats on being mostly done with your dissertation.  Bagel - I think Philly is a little too tough for you.  Will you be living in the suburbs and commuting?    Later doots, and by doots I mean dudes,  Joel

      Bagel dute, I'm not sure if I'd ever check the Friendster thing to see if I have added new friends to any list of friends. I'm quite happy with the friends that I have now and am sure that I'll be busy enough with skool that finding dates via the friend-friendly Friendster friend-finding fructose-limited network isn't my style. Sorry, dute but maybe later.  Stasi, this is in no way a cut at your expertise on the web-wild ways of wowing the chicas (or cuban guys). For now, I'm a romantic and have my heart set on one girl and...well, we'll see.  p.s. Bagel, I know there are hot young ladies with intellect in the city of brotherly love. Philly.com said that the dance club Shampoo is the hip place to boogy and libations around town lean toward "colorful concoctions with silly names and fruity tastes." In other words, you'll love the neo-soft slant of Philly.

      Chairman, friendster is an internet-'friend' community.&nbsp; Basically you post pictures of yourself and write a 'cute' bio.&nbsp; As I have found out, it is also a great place to meet girls to go on sweet dates.&nbsp;   Bagel, the head of the psychiatry department at the University of Chicago's name is Dawn Graziano.&nbsp; I should ask her how JP is doing (I mean, I have never spoken to him in my life, yet am concerned about his well-being).&nbsp;&nbsp;   F' the Cubs, F' the White&nbsp;Sox.&nbsp; Football starts soon, and that means that it is time for my beloved Green Bay Packers to&nbsp;suck ass&nbsp;again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      1.&nbsp; I have just&nbsp;made each of you administrators on this blog.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can now check who is a member of the blog and who has been INVITED to join the blog.&nbsp; Just click on "settings" then "members" and scroll down.&nbsp; You will&nbsp; see that Stick was obviously invited to join the blog.  2.&nbsp; Pyka loves to talk about how he part-owns the bakery.&nbsp; It is kind of like a cooperative.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds rich.  3.&nbsp; I am returning to the Chi around the 16th of August but leaving for Philly around the 20th.&nbsp; I hope that some of you are around so we can kick it wicked haadcore.  4.&nbsp; Clement for Garciaparra?&nbsp; I say:&nbsp; No way, Jose.  5.&nbsp; It's no surprise that Landon's hair is sweet.&nbsp; What is surprising is that I didn't talk about Penn the entire post.  6.&nbsp; (O)(U)(T)(S)  7.&nbsp; Can someone at least mention Graz in their next post?&nbsp; Give him a shout out or something?&nbsp; This blog has gone far too long without a Graz mention.

      So I've been in Berkeley for the past two days and it has been awesome.&nbsp; I wish you guys could see Landon's hair.&nbsp; It is honestly probably the sweetest hair that anyone has ever had.   Part of the issue with my chafing was that until the marathon I didn't have any good shorts to run in.&nbsp; I would wear basketball shorts, and either boxers or no underwear at all.&nbsp; Eventually I got boxer briefs, and that made it better, and then for the actual run I had real running shorts and had no problems.   Tonight I'm having dinner with Pyka, who now works at a bakery that was just voted the #1 bakery in San Francisco by the newspaper (the same article, incidentally,&nbsp;voted Jamba Juice the best place to get a non-alcoholic drink)!   Chairman, I don't get back until the 12th.&nbsp; Bad timing... And once again, as for Stick, he adamantly insists that "Bagel never invited me to join the blogger."

      J, I told you on the phone that I'd be leaving around August 6th or 7th. not so. because i had procrastinated, i bought the cheaper 2-week limit southwest ticket for the 11th. didn't remember when you return but maybe we'll meet up. Can someone tell Stick that I no longer need to speak with him? It seems as though I can just as easily get my Stick updates via Shafer/Bagel/Silver Steve/John Kerry/Al Sharpton, etc. Rev. Sharpton can tell me more about Abbott's diabolical plans or living with Stick's girlfriend in Boston. Stas, despite HIPAA violations, I'd enjoy hearing about your wacked out patients. I was with another asperger's pt several weeks ago and this kid was amazing.

      My Dad knows that I'm very excited about going to Penn.&nbsp; So naturally, he likes to give me shit about it.&nbsp; So every time we talk about logistics, like loans or housing, he says, "David, have you found your housing for Penn State yet?"&nbsp; And I get really mad, and tell him that I'm not going to Penn State.&nbsp; And he says something like&nbsp; "Whatever."  I thought that you guys would find this hilarious, and would want to refer to my school forthwith as Penn State.  In other news, I miss GR, The Captain, The Silver Fox, and Mr. Stava. What rich individuals.  &nbsp;

      So I sent in my deposit for UPenn.&nbsp; I am really, really stoked about it.&nbsp;   Whitey, I don't think Jamba Juice is for pussies.&nbsp; It is a fruity delight!&nbsp; I'm sure that it goes down smooth---- not like enjoing a cold one at Wrigley, but smooth nonetheless.  Who am I kidding.&nbsp; Whitey, if you drink Jamba Juice, you should shop at Talbott's and Pier 1 Imports.&nbsp;

      Landon,&nbsp; I will definitely send you the digits.&nbsp; I also have a very slight bend to the left, (not as much as Justin's), but I start out to the right, so I wonder if that negates any chafing I would have.&nbsp; Regardless, I will let the physics graduate students handle the number.  I love Jamba Juice, I have no idea why.&nbsp; I am convinced their beverages ( or are they really beverages?) contain some addictive drug in them.&nbsp; I also love saying Jamba.&nbsp; I also love making fun of people who engage in their fruity consumption, while I remain in the closet, revealing my passionate amore only to my closest confidants.  Stasi, why must you stop friendster dating.&nbsp; Stasi being Stasi, I think it is ridiculous that you don't have 3 or 4 dates a week.  Blogger has now made me late for work....OUTS!!!!

      Robert Langdon didn't need to be a Harvard symbologist to understand that it is SWEET that Bagel got into Penn!&nbsp; The west coast surely made a mistake.&nbsp;   About whitey's wang:&nbsp; I'm pretty sure Justin's chafed him so much because it points slighty to the left.&nbsp; Whitey, if you'd like, I could calculate the natural frequencies of your pendulum like wang and make sure you do not run with the same frequency or any sub harmonics, thus avoiding unnatural chafing.

      As a famous rapper said, and now Todd,&nbsp;I sayeth to you: "Girl, it's easy to love me now.&nbsp; But would you love me when I was down and out?&nbsp; Would you still have love for me?"  Todd, I am perturbed by your critique of my previous post.&nbsp; It's almost as if I was shooting a jumper, and you scoffed at the fact I was shooting it.&nbsp; How rude.  Anyway, I have tons of work to do today, but I will certianly check the blog at least 3 times an hour.  Todd, I will definitely take the Chinatown bus to the NYC...

      Justy, why did your whang hurt from the marathon.&nbsp; I haven't experienced this yet, but am concerned what will happen when I hit the 18 mile and above range.&nbsp; Will boxer briefs suffice?&nbsp; Will this nix our plans to run the marathon in Speedo's?&nbsp; Has the Speedo brand become such a part of the american vocabulary that it no longer needs to be capitalized unless referring to the actual brand?&nbsp; You know, like Teva's.&nbsp; Bagel, thanks for the welcome to the blog.&nbsp; I have actually placed an anonymous suggestion in our PD suggestion box that we wear dark blue capes.&nbsp; I just find it appropriate.&nbsp; I think I will also find it appropriate to suggest swords.&nbsp; Oh, and whips too; big, long ones, with the very thick well-fastened handles.  There are two things I hate in this world.&nbsp; One is Colin Farrell.&nbsp; The other is Josh Hartnett.

      1) Bagel: congrats on Penn.&nbsp; That is sweet.&nbsp; SWEET.&nbsp; But your idea about Whitey wearing a cape to the Marathon?&nbsp; F'ing STUPID !&nbsp;&nbsp; Good luck to Whitey and Justin with the Marathon.&nbsp; That is awesome.&nbsp;   2) But&nbsp;Justin, remember last time you ran the marathon, your piece hurt so much that you said you'd never run again?  3) Does anyone else think it's weird that Justin is going "to camp for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks" in Oregon?&nbsp; And Justin/Landute -&nbsp;remember the Woodsman who we used to play basketball with?&nbsp; That guy was rich - he was a woodsmen, yet a good all-around ballplayer.&nbsp; Kind of a Nate James type (except a woodsman, of course)  &nbsp;

      Well, I just signed up on-line to join Whitey (and Aaron Mlot) in the marathon.&nbsp; Who else is interested?  Also, tomorrow morning I leave for a few weeks.&nbsp; I will try and get on the computer every once in a while (you know, to check the blog), so hopefully I will have stories of&nbsp;yetis and crazy mountain men for you.

      First, thanks for the congrats, Stas.&nbsp; I appreciate it.  Now, let me welcome Whitey&nbsp;to the board.&nbsp; Whitey,&nbsp; I think you should dress up like Alexander the Great for the marathon.&nbsp; Get a cape, and make a sword out of duct tape.&nbsp; I'm sure you could find some other people to be your henchmen.  You could yell:&nbsp; "The Ottoman Empire will be mine!"&nbsp;   Or, even better, you could dress up like Colin Farrell playing Alexander the Great.&nbsp; I don't think it could get richer than that.

      Bagel, congratulations...thats awesome news about going to Penn.&nbsp;   So far today I spent my morning in therapy with my aspergers kid.&nbsp; Kind of funny, the kid thinks I work for the FBI and am going to put him either in jail or a mental institution.&nbsp;   Justin, I prefer to think that my hair is reminiscent of Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt rather than that douche bag Lyle Lovett.&nbsp;   Now to go read Dan Brown's Digital Fortress.&nbsp;

      Between NW and Duke, because Duke said--- DING!  That's kind of good, though, because I would have had trouble deciding betwixt the two.  Now, we are waiting on Penn.&nbsp; I'm sure a lot of you really care- a lot.  in other news, I have to revise the state dept proposal on Cyprus.&nbsp; Not too happy about this, but I think that we can get it, and I think I can still go to Cyprus.  Let's see...what else...I have some sweet ideas for a possible Lessek/ Jozwiak joint bachelor party.&nbsp; If only I was the one planning.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am not.&nbsp;   I'm going out again with Christina, the girl who went to the Christian fundamentalist college.&nbsp; Turns out she's not so crazy.&nbsp; Actually a really nice girl.&nbsp; So I'm looking forward to going out with her again on Sunday.  PB says...OUTS.

I'm calling Penn right now...to see if they had made a decision.  Stasi, I don't know Katie Newberry, but I'm sure she'll be 1) really into metal and 2) really into you.  O.U.T.S.

      Berkeley:&nbsp;Probably not a good fit for Bagel.&nbsp; Bagel is not quite alternative enough.&nbsp; At Berkeley, you do your own thing.&nbsp; You protest.&nbsp; Smoke pot.&nbsp; Get a sweet physics tattoo.&nbsp; Bagel, on the other hand, is guided by societal norms and his quest for prestige.&nbsp; Berkeley is therefore not&nbsp;a good fit.  Duke, on the other hand, would be nearly ideal.&nbsp; Bagel could be the "Sixth Man".&nbsp; Coach K would be his coach.&nbsp; He could eat at the Loop every single day.&nbsp; He could hang out with the Captain (Bert) on weekends.&nbsp;And all incoming freshman now get free ipods.

      First, and unfortunately, going to Berkeley is no longer an option.&nbsp; I was rejected by them today.  Shaq is back.&nbsp; Check the ridiculous things he said yesterday when arriving in Miami:  O'Neal referred to himself as "the Millennium Goliath."  Shaq is back, and will dominate all basketball next year.&nbsp; Check the ridiculous things he said: On buying a home in South Florida: "I will be walking naked on the beach. If you take pictures of me naked on the beach, don't sell them to the Enquirer unless I get 15 percent."   On being 32 years old: "I'm like toilet paper, toothpaste and certain amenities -- I'm proven to be good. I've still got five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 years left."    On his weight: "I play my best ball at 345. I need my meat because I'm going to take a beating. If you put a guy in front of me who eats salad and cucumber and baked chicken all day, I'll kill him."

      I forgot to mention these two incidents that happened at the airport:  1) I saw a kid get his shoelace caught in an escalator at Midway.&nbsp; Everyone was screaming and the kid and the&nbsp;mom were crying as people were trying to rip the shoe out of the escalator.&nbsp; I was too far away to do anything about it, but I ran over.&nbsp; Just as I got there, some technician guy was opening a door to the escalator, and he pushed some button that stopped it.  2) Coming back home, I saw a guy dressed up in a full-out clown costume getting hassled by the people at security.&nbsp; The guy was literally wearing makeup and had a big red nose and everything, and he was trying to get past the people that check IDs.&nbsp; There was no way you could have figured out who the fuck this guy was.&nbsp; He even had a big flowery dress on and big shoes.&nbsp; So there were a whole bunch of security people standing there looking at his drivers license and shaking their heads.&nbsp; I left before the situation was settled.

Sheffield attended by Seth Benson (a friend from Duke) and his girlfriend, Jillian Schwartz (also from school).&nbsp; This weekend in Sacramento Jillian qualified for the Olympics and so is gonna be competing in Greece.&nbsp; Pretty sweet.

      So I was up $250 within the first three hours.&nbsp; Then, within the first 6 hours, I was down $300.&nbsp; Fantastic.&nbsp; By the end of the first day, I was down $430.&nbsp; Needless to say, I was not excited about this. &nbsp; I made all but 150 back playing poker, which I now fancy myself as some sort of a player. &nbsp; In other news, NU requires a $500 deposit by Friday.&nbsp; Hopefully, I will find out soon whether I got in anywhere else.&nbsp; Both UPenn and Berkeley, (I am expecting rejections from both) said they would tell me by the end of the week. &nbsp; In other other news, no one else posts on the blog, so it's hard to know what the f is going on with everyone else. &nbsp; Peace in the M-E.

      So for the first time since Tim's bachelor party, I will return to Sin City.  I roll out of the D-ver tonight around midnight.  I am making the trans-Utah and part of AZ trek with my boss' son, who is a sweet dude.  Also, I am going to a wine tasting tonight.  I am bringing a Christian fundamentalist, who went to a crazy fundamentalist college.  urlLink  .    Not good times, but I will tell the blog how both the date and the Vegas trip turned out on Monday.  Outs.

      Yes, that Ron Santo dude played third base.  And yes, his number was retired by the Cubs but he has yet to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame like Ernie Banks and Billy Williams.  Many see this to be a great injustice, as exemplified by the movie "This Old Cub" (directed and produced by Jeff Santo, by the way).   Me, I don't really give a shit.

      Justin, are you going to the Brew & View with Gilbert to see This Old Cub?  I know Chris loves that one legged douche.  All he used to talk about was how Ront Santo was the best third baseman ever (did that fucker even play third base?)  Just printed out my dissertation proposal.  Hopefully I dont have to do any major changes on it.

      Yo, so I just saw Chris Gilbert (along with Rob Rada) over at Chalet Chalet's last show.  Pretty sweet.  He told me to say what's up to everybody!!  I am also 90% sure I saw Gino Stella riding his back down Armitage this afternoon.  I assume he says what's up too.

If the State Department picks it up, I will be traveling to the Cypriot nation in the next few weeks.  Oh, and this blog has only been up for one week, and I am already the only one posting on it.  Sweet!

      So I almost died yesterday.  I'm not kidding.  I missed a lightpost by a foot after the old guy hit me.  The lightpost would have split my car in half, guaranteed.  Now I have to deal with these insurance f's.  This really makes me think about my own mortality, you know?  Like, you know, how we're all mortal?  I mean, life is so fragile.  One day it could just end, and you'd be like, "Whoah."  Out,  Jim Anchower.

      I went with Craig tonight to go see King Arthur.  Just as Shafer promised, it was an excellent 'period piece.'  It also reaffirmed my belief that there are only three types of movies out now:  1) Epic period pieces 2) Comic book movies 3) Comedies starring at least two of the following: Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, Jack Black  I am not complaining about any of these.  Bagel, don't you have some sort of insurance? In any case, you could always rent a car from Branca in the meantime...

      Ok...my car was just totalled in Denver by some really old guy who is almost 70.  It was his fault--- he's being issued a ticket.  So, you ask...what are my options?  With no car, a $500 deductible, and essentially no way to get around?  Well, here they are: 1)  Complain on the blogger or 2)  Go watch Anchorman again.  I choose #2.  Out.

      Obviously, Justin, you should come to DENVER, because it is a sweet town and we would have a rich time.  Perhaps some other compadres would like to meet up?  I have a ridiculous amount of work to do today.  However, I will post on the blog constantly.

      Sweet idea to get this thing going again, Bagel!  So I'm off to San Francisco around July 28th or 29th.  Before that, however, I am considering a trip down to Charleston or elsewhere for a few days.  Would anyone else be interested in either going there for a couple of days or maybe meeting up somewhere else during that time?  Now I'm off to go get some custard at Scooter's or whatever on Belmont.  Thanks again for getting this going, Speegs.

      This past weekend was totally absurd.  Pete, one of Styles' old roommates (who has been invited to post on the blog) Rob (Styles' current rommmate) and I hit the town for three straight nights (Fri, Sat, Sun), the middle of which was my quarter century birthday.  (Props to Joel for having it on his calendar)  Anyway, general debauchery abounded, but it's certainly not fodder for a upper-class, snotty blog such as this.   Can't decide whether to call the girl who I met last weekend.  Hmmm.  We'll see.

      1.  I don't remember Mr. Noel, high school political science teacher.  I do, however, remember Mr. Noel senior outing chaperone.  While on said senior outing, he told Whitey: "No one likes you, Bob, and you have no friends."  That was a) totally rich and b) said when Bob was surrounded by all of his friends.  2.  Today is my last day in Denver.  I return to Chi tomorrow, will be in Champaign on Thursday and Friday nights, and then leave for Philly on Sunday.  3.  Now, onto the currently completely impractical race around the world.  I have several objections.  First, the budget is WAYYY too low.  This can be rectified by adding in a provision that you can work---ala Alexander Supertramp aka Chris McCandless-- to finance your journey during the journey.   However, different people in the race will have different marketable skills.  For example, Joel will be skilled at talking about hardcore metal or whatever, Whitey will be skilled at male prostitution, and I will be skilled at being an upstanding young citizen.  SO...we must limit the type of work one can engage in.  I propose that that race participants (hereafter "racers" ) can only work as ditchdiggers.  As ditchdiggers, racers must earn their keep doing one thing, and one thing only:  Digging those fucking ditches.    It is perfect for the around the world race (ATWR) because it tests diligence, intestinal fortitude, and lots of other shit.  It will also pad your pocketbook.  Even assuming that racers do not pay for lodging, we still have to pay for our sustenance.  This will require more than 1000 USD each, especially when I'm on the Cambodian/ Laos border where rice costs approximately .00001 cents per bag, but I can't find any motherfucking soy sauce.  But I hear they have a booming ditchdigging market in Phenom Penh.  4. As Stick would say, I stonebutt and render your latitude longitude requirements usless, pursuant to point six (6) of my revisions to your original proposal  5.  OBVIOUSLY no one can take planes or helicopters.  However, I have a few caveats.  a) if a racer makes enough money digging ditches to buy his/ her own plane, he/ she can do so and fly in it, with the express provision that he/ she is a licsensed pilot and flies the plane.  b)  Racers can travel via air in a hot air balloon, but only if it's with Steve Fossett c)  Racers can travel by zeppelin any time they so choose.  6.  I think that there must be some checkpoints in the ATWR.  For example, one checkpoint could be a Norwegian fjord.  Another could be Everest Base Camp.  Or another could be Mr. Lessek's Hilton Head House.  This would engender a healthy competition within the race, thereby keeping racers interested and not focused on lucrative ditchdigging work.   7.  I can't wait for Joel to blog on how my ideas suck, and how his original race proposal was dead sexy.  8.  Joel, we will talk about the ATWR more when I am down in Champaign on Thursday/ Friday.  9.  I obviously will win this race.

      First of all, I would like to thank everyone for the ZERO phone calls I received regarding the category 4 hurricane, gaily named “Charley”, that I sat through the other day.  Real class acts, all you fuckers.  Lucky for you I am still alive.    Bagel – In the future, when forwarding your correspondence with Mr. Noel, Political Science high-school teacher, could you please include his replies?  I’d be interested in reading them.  I’m also interested in where you picked up the phrase, “threw down the gauntlet”.  I would describe my interest as “more than average, but not extreme”.     Whitey – I challenge you to race around the world.  See a map of the world  urlLink here  to comprehend the rest of this challenge.  We will begin in Manzanita, Oregon and return there via Yokohama, Japan (read on for my explanation).  I am saying via Yokohama, because we are not allowed to cross the Pacific Ocean or any longitudes between 120 deg W and 150 deg E (essentially the Pacific Ocean) until we have reached Yokohama, forcing Easterly travel around the globe.  We will carry GPS tracking devices as well as world capable cell phones allowing others to verify our locations.  We are also not allowed to go north of Latitude 60 deg N or South of 30 deg S, essentially preventing North or South Pole shortcuts and plane travel.  We are limited to a budget of 1000 USD each (at that time, no correction for inflation) and we begin on the day of your 30th birthday,  May 1st, 2009 and end when the second of us finishes.  I welcome any other of our friends to join us in this race, only as competitors though.  I am totally serious about this race and we can work out more details later, perhaps devoting a blogger thereto (and I will work on a book deal as well).  May I suggest that you brush up on your travel and language skills should you desire to compete?  Re: Jillian.  I would be interested in who came up with the following totally pointless Olympic events:  Pommel Horse Pole Vault Water Polo  May I suggest replacements?  I may?  Jump-Punching Jumping Holding breath under water  Beardo a.k.a. Justin – I am pretty sure you were talking to Stasi when you said that his Dad probably has the Jansen Directive, but I’m pretty sure my Dad has it too, which confused me.  I read a lot of Ludlum when I was 13-14, and I think I wanted to be a spy after that.  Awesome.  Chairman – It would be ridiculously awesome if you got all inflatable furniture.  Todd- to post about what used to happen at Duke, please see  urlLink this  site.  No talking about the film “The Breakfast Club” on here either, please.  I’ll try to post some hurricane pics up on here if I have time tonight.  Otherwise I wish each and every one of you a good evening.

      I apologize for my recent Blogger absence.  I have been busy with much work, and personal, relationship turmoil not fit for the Blogger.  But I digress, and digress into rage over this Atkin's diet.  Listen, fad diets are just that.  The key to health and weight loss will never be in a diet.  I know people who eat very little but are too sedentary and overweight.  I also know people like myself who eat pasta and bread and just about anything and stay healthy.  Ryan, my tenant, tried Atkins. He bought everything Atkins at the store.  Low carb tortillas, Low carb ice cream, Low carb cheese.  But he would eat 3 quarts of low carb ice cream over two days and make quesadillas every day.  When I started getting in shape, I would only monitor two things: My fat intake, and my exercise.  A low carb diet deprives you of energy to exercise and increase your metabolism and your overall health and wellness.  As a short term "fad" diet of course it will work for weight loss, but so will limiting the water you drink, and other ridiculous and unhealthy measures!  It isn't a long term solution to overall health because you are putting limitations on the amount of energy you can expend.  This McGreevey guy is ridiculous.  Even more ridiculous is this Cipel guy.  We discussed this last night at work and equated it to if one of us slept with some famous hot married chick.  For discussion's sake, and only discussion's sake, let's say...Jennifer Aniston, ( seriously, I don't want anything further about that selection, it was only because I saw Brad Pitt in the paper next to me).  Most of us would be grateful to Jennifer extending her infedulous sexual romp to ourselves, and would probably refrain from blackmailing her.  From what I have heard about it, I am sure I would enjoy Moneyball.  I really only read non-fiction books.  I would have to recommend "Full House" by Stephen Jay Gould.  In it he argues how diversity, not complexity, should be the true measure of progress.  He takes about 1/3 of the book to discuss how the decline of .400 hitting in baseball supports his beliefs.  Very interesting.  I also enjoy an author named Gregg Easterbrook, who writes on current social and political issues, but also writes a weekly, very lengthy, and humorous column called Tuesday Morning Quarterback for NFL.com.  T, is there anything better than Deuce that comes out clean, crisp and rock solid on all sides....as if it just fell out!!!!  I call it "THE DIAMOND CUTTER"  -spice trader.....rich!!!! -hurdles.....I'm game!!!!! -Blogger...I'm out!!!!

      I also think the whole sordid affair is amazing. If the allegations are true, that Cipel dude is some bastard. I mean, he was gettin' some from the damn governor of all high and mighty folk and then he has the audacity to blackmail his arse. I'm probably just siding with McGreevey because he's another crazy Mc and we's gots to stick together. And eat lots of potatoes and corned beef and cabbage. Not to mention the whiskey and barrels of beer.

      Do any of you guys play this ESPN Fantasy game where you pick a different baseball player every day, and if he gets a hit, your own "hitting streak" continues.  And if the player you select hits safely in 57 consecutive games, breaking DiMaggio's record, you win a boatload of cash.  Well Starter was telling me that he had a nice streak going.  It was getting fairly interesting.  And then he selected Edgar Renteria, who went hitless.  Why the F would he select Edgar Renteria?  Also, Whitey, can you give a bullet point or two on why the Atkins diet doesn't work?  I hear too many people talk about how great it is, and I'd like a few solid arguments to counter with.  Lastly, I have a SWEET story about a recent Deuce. It's too long for the Blogger and I don't have the patience to write as much as Bagel, so I'll try to recount it to Justin so he can repeat it as appropriate.

      Stasi, it sounds like you had a pretty normal day.  I mean, it's not like hanging out with Trotta at the Brooks Brothers store is abnormal.   It's not a big deal or anything.  Just another boring day.  By the way, Trotta LOVES the law.  Boy, does that guy love it.

      When our group of friends hung out at Duke, we talked about alot of different things.  Well, usually we talked about the Planet of the Apes series, the Sacramento Kings, potential nicknames for people on campus, and how soft Craig was.  One thing we did not talk about was books.  My roommate Maestro would always discuss literature with our friend Wheatly, though.  We called their dicussions the "Culture Club."  The Culture Club was like a fraternity,  but Kaufman was not in it.  Anyway, the Blogger seems to be transforming itself into an offshoot of the Culture Club.  There's nothing wrong with this.   But I can add little, as the only book I have read in the past few years is Moneyball.  It was decent.  I think Whitey would like it.

      So Trotta and I decided to go to that new outlet mall in Aurora (the one with the Puma store).  It turned out to be a sweet day.  You know, just the usual stuff Trotta and I do, trying on suits at Brooks Brothers (he picked suits out for me that would look good on me and I did the same for him), looking at all the new shirts that the Polo store offered, sharing a pretzel, and had a wonderful discussion regarding women.    It was totally like a Sex and the City episode.  Good times.

      bagel, here are some thoughts. you have way too much time to be posting every few minutes. try painting or living in the GLBT community. seriously, congrats again on getting closer to mesopotamia. cyprus can launch your career as a spice trader between the queen's markets and the far east. do it marco polo style. btw, check out Norman Rosenbaum (Fordham) and his book "The Myth of Moral Justice." there was a blurb about teaching law students morally in the Times. also, Robert Bennett (NU) and his "Talking it Through" about various contemporary qualms (one about the electoral college system).  down in tucson. no furniture yet but i'll work on that.  styles, sorry i haven't called you back lately. i'll do it soon. there are jets flying around town every few hours it seems. sweet afb down here.  j, c'etait une idee super de visiter le nord-ouest des EU. n'oubliez pas les villes parce que, un jour, je souhaite a aller la-bas pour une visite aussi. a la prochain.  good luck to both downtown and whitey during their race. maybe you can set up a 100m hurdles race.  the aussie thorpedo will be hard to beat this following week!

      Justin, I did not go on 5-6 dates when you were gone. Just 3. One with this girl Brittany, who besides being quite weird, is actually quite awesome. If you want details about my dates, you are going to have to talk to Shafer.  I will also use this space to display my love for one Dan Brown.  The man not only wrote about esteemed symbologist Robert Langdon, but also took on NASA in Deception Point, and the NSA in Digital Fortress.  Digital Fortress is a must read for anyone who uses the internet and is worried that the government might know what you are doing (well that is at least what was stated on the book jacket).

      Hey everybody I just got back into Berkeley this afternoon and am checking the blogger from the public library here while Landon finishes what he described to me as "an important experiment" in his lab.  A couple of nights ago claire and I camped on the beach in a place called Manzanita, Oregon (only a couple of miles away from the rocks in Goonies!), and it was probably the sweetest place in the world.  I know a few people on this blog have talked about moving to the pacific northwest at some point, and I'd like to put Manzanita or any of the other 10 or so towns right around there along the coast on the list of places.  I am back in Chicago late Thursday night (the 12th).  Bagel, I would definitely be up for hanging out the night of the 17th, or any of the days after that.  I know that Landon is gonna be in town next weekend, so it would be awesome if you are still around then.  Shafer is gonna be back in town for a few days as well, so I'm sure lots of people might be getting together.  Once again, sweet posts from everybody! I would, however, have liked to hear a little more from stasi on how his dates have been going.  I've been away for about two weeks and so I'm assuming there are at least 5-6 dates to hear about (I'd also like to suggest a sweet Robert Ludlum thriller: The Janson Directive.  While Paul Janson couldn't even hold a candle to Robert Langdon, it's a sweet book.  I'll bet your dad has it - it's by the dude that wrote all of those Bourne books)...

      With Whitey again attacking me in a Castillo-esque fashion, I must resort to my normal inane ways of posting.  In the past year and a half, I have developed a strong affinity for the egg salad sandwich.  I like mine tempered with garnish--- lettuce and tomato--- along with a bit of salt.  The bit of salt does the trick; it makes the egg salad piquant.  Egg salad has all the right nutrients.  Protein, starch, Vitamins A, B, C, D and Potassium.  It has just the right amount of Zinc, too.  Unlike Joel, who is 'Atkins-friendly' and who I have seen sneaking Michelob Ultra's into his refrigerator, I concentrate on getting all five food groups into my diet.  The egg salad sandwich is a great lunch item because it sets you up for a delicious, meaty dinner.  Please comment.

      Really, you've got to be kidding me?  I agree this has "raced to the forefront of our social conscious", but why must this race to the forefront of Hellcourts Blogger Part Deux.  I turn to Blogger to escape from the daily stresses of our lives, our jobs, and the social issues that take their toll on all of us.  Although well thought-out and presented, reading that 6 page BLOG was like a stick in my eye.  Also, I cannot escape this pole-vaulting Jillian.  She had a whole article in the Sun-Times and the Daily Herald.  She has been on the local news.  I recently picked up a SELF magazine, (for those misogynists of you who never pick up a woman's magazine, SELF is a pretty popular and well-circulated one), and she has an article in there where she is showing off different exercises to do.  Is she now the Queen of all Media???  I have also given up on spelling and grammar in BLOGGER.

      I have refrained from political commentary in one form or another for the duration of this blog. Most of my posts have focused, rather predictably, on myself, my escapades, or my travails during the previous/ upcoming weekends. Today, I will abscond my largely hedonistic and self-indulgent posts in favor of a well organized political treatise. And so it begins:  The recent debate regarding the Federal Gay Marriage Amendment is of particular concern to me. I am completely in favor of legalizing two-person marriage in all forms: women marrying men, men marrying men, women marrying women, and transgenders marrying each other.  In 1996, a Republican Congressional Majority passed the "Defense of Marriage Act" which had little policy implications but placed Democrats on the record on the subject of gay marriage. Barney Frank, an openly gay Massachusetts Congressman, encouraged Democrats who faced close elections in November '96 to vote for the bill (contrary to Frank and the LGBT community's interest) because it was designed as a "wedge issue" for Democrats. Republicans used the DOMA to retain their majority in both houses of Congress.  Fast forward to 2004, where the issue of gay marriage has raced to the forefront of our social consciousness. Massachusetts is again playing a large role in this tale-- its Supreme Court threw down the gauntlet and effectively legalized gay marriage within the Commonwealth. This drew a swarm of criticism from Republicans across the country, and spurred the party of Lincoln to take a drastic measure: the proposition of a Federal Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage.  One steadfast common characteristic of most Republicans, especially those living in the Western states, is their distaste of government intrusion in their lives. They value liberty in the true sense of the word: lower taxes, less gun regulations, less constraints on their livelihood. Classical liberalism is especially attractive when you look at how it comports with the American ideals of individualism and self-reliance. However, the social conservative wing of the Republican party has been slowly driving the party to a less consistent ideological view. The new majoritarian Republican holds a strange concoction of differing and sometimes conflicting ideologies. For example, the "moral" wing of the party rails against the right to an abortion while at the same time assailing government gun regulation.  In defense of this line of thinking, I don't think consistency is necessary in political viewpoints. I also don't think classical liberalism has been the center of the Republican Party's ideology for quite some time. But I do think that any vestiges of social classical liberalism to which the Republican Party was holding on have now been cut by their extremely virulent opposition to gay marriage.  The Gay Marriage Amendment was spearheaded by first term Colorado Congresswoman Marilyn Musgrave, a social conservative among social conservatives. Along with other gay marriage opponents, she uses "the sanctity of marriage" as an  a priori  claim against the practice of gay marriage. She claims that marriage is "only between a man and a woman."  To me, this is total, unequivocal bullshit.  Some opponents of gay marriage argue that if we expand the definition of marriage to include gay marriage, there will be nothing to stop us from granting marriage licenses to polygamists. This argument has two problems. First, it uses the faulty "slippery slope" argument, which presupposes little or no discipline among actors. For example, we have (un)successfully limited marriage to a man and a woman for 225+ years. It is irrational to assume that we cannot limit it after expansion only because of the expansion itself. Second, polygamy is fundamentally different than two person marriage. Polygamy is fundamentally grounded on a power relationship rather than love. Men often take wives younger than 18. and some wives are as young as 14. For an eye-opening study of polygamy, see Jon Krakauer's  Under the Banner of Heaven,  which details the foundations and consequences of polygamy.  Other opponents of gay marriage, including Dr. Laura, buttress their views by citing Leviticus 18:22, which condemns homosexuality as an abomination.  To me, it does not make any sense to interpret Leviticus literally.  A widely circulated e-mail that can be found here:  urlLink http://www.laughparty.com/view.php?id=946&amp;sort=2  demonstrates that Leviticus also prevents eating shellfish and promotes the ownership of slaves.  But why, then, should we support gay marriage?  From a philosophical viewpoint, I think that the US government would not be  granting a right  if it legalizes gay marriage. Rather,  it is presently preventing a right  from being actualized. This is an important distinction: as a country, we are denying a natural right to our citizens, one that is included in our core natural rights of life,  liberty , and property. Any Millsian liberal (and one does not need to be a classical liberal or an offshoot of a classical liberal to advocate gay marriage) will recognize that we should not curtail another's liberty if it does not curtail our own. The Right's promotion of the supposed "moral good" does not justify the gay marriage ban because even if Musgrave's neighbor is a married gay man, this surely does not curtail her liberty.  Second, I believe that it is morally incumbent upon our society to grant the LGBT community the ability to marry. It comports with every fundamental overriding ideal in both our moral and political world: right to contract, tolerance, individual freedom, and love. It does not comport with one blurb in Leviticus. But if you look at the message of every religion, every faith, and every moral code, the base ideals of each support the ability of gays to marry.  So what to do?  Now that the Gay Marriage Ban Amendment has been defeated- not soundly, but defeated nonetheless-- we should look to engage the American public in this debate. This is a good first step in the process, because if we get people talking, and expose them to both sides of the debate, we will surely win. So my immediate exhortation: Start talking about this with your friends, neighbors and family, and encourage them to talk about it with others. We can start a groundswell of public opinion that will overtake the Marilyn Musgrave's, Tom DeLay's and George W. Bush's. We can and we will.  I have long characterized the fight for gays to marry as the biggest fight civil rights fight of our generation-- the generation that grew up in the '80's; the children of 10 Yard Fight, Super Soakers, and Garbage Pail Kids. Our parents took sides in many fights: they were either supporters or or opponents of Vietnam, and they were either supporters or opponents of the civil rights movement. I'm sure our parents have subjected us to different versions revisionist history. All of them (according to them) were on the correct side of the Civil Rights movement, and all of them found it outrageous that more wasn't being done at the time. Both my parents have told me that they were on the right side of the Civil Rights movement. My father has even told me stories about him sitting in a room with Jesse Jackson at the '68 convention. This makes me enormously proud; I have absolutely no doubt that my father's story is true, and I'm sure everyone has heard stories like this from their parents in one form or another.  My point is this: We can either sit on the sidelines and watch the right to marry get trampled by a motivated but incorrect minority. Or we can engage, organize, and get our hands dirty.   History will certainly judge our generation on our fight for or against the right for gays to marry. We can either send a message of tolerance or one of exclusion. We can either win the battle or stand on the sidelines. I, for one, would love to tell my children that I fought the good fight.   You could rally for change in your neighborhood, in your church, or in your battleground state. Or you could just do this:  urlLink http://www.fthevote.com

      This is my penultimate weekend in Denver.  I don't think it will be a particularly big weekend, because I am really tired from staying up so late last night, and I want to be well rested for next weekend's activities.   I am also playing golf tomorrow.  Joel, sweet Man U jersey.   Latah.

      I was thinking today about how great I would be at finding treasure if it were in fact true that pirates buried their treasure and didn't just spend that shit on whores named Sally.  I was also thinking about how I am so great at racing.  I spoke with Bob about it online.    joel:  i think there's almost no way i could ever lose to you in any sort of race bob: you are kidding me right???? joel:  no joel:  i'm totally serious joel:  maybe a car race, because you could use a police car bob: a running race??? joel:  but one of those treasure hunt races i would kick your ass in joel:  like cannonball run i mean joel:  i could beat you in any running race joel:  especially a sprint joel:  i could run circles around you bob: what about a one mile race bob: you are ABSURD joel:  backwards you might beat me joel:  i mean me backwards and you forwards bob:  Cannonball run race I would dominate joel: no way joel:  it wouldn't even be close joel:  i would be the greatest at finding treasure joel:  you would get your car stuck in mud trying to take some dumb shortcut  It's true, I am the greatest racer on the face of the earth.    Bagel, I am glad that you enjoyed the first picture that I put on here.  Here is a second pic for you.

      Todd, have they ever heard of Capri pants??? Or was everyone there wearing them already and they just call them pants??? ( yes, I know this joke has been done with Chinese Food, etc, etc.)  -whitay-  P.S.  Castillo probably could have written a much more clever blog.

      It's 3am Denver time and I'm still up.  Why, you ask?  It has to do with work, Tanzania, and an Israeli woman names Dahlia.  Goddamn, am I inrtriguing.  I just had to finish a proposal for work and turn it in 12 noon Tanzanian loca time.  By the by, it's cool to call Dar Es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, just "Dar."  I saw all three of the Cubs games.  SWEET SWEEP!  I'm off to go sleep on my work's couch.

      After spending a total of six nights in Italy, I returned to New York last night.  I am glad to see that John Olerud, one of Landute's favorite baseball players, has also returned to NY, albeit with the Yankees.  While Olerud lacks the wit of Frank Castillo, he is a consummate professional, much like Stick.  Italy was sweet.  At St. Peter's Basilica, visitors must wear long pants.  I did not realize this, so I was wearing shorts.  After being denied admission to the Basilica, some shady Italian guy offered me these completely ridiculous black canvas painter's pants for 5 euro.  I tried to negotiate, offering 4 euro, but he would not budge. So I bought the pants for 5 euro and entered the Basilica looking absurd.  Unfortunately, I did not see the Pontif, but it was still sweet.  Other highlights included going to the Coliseum and repeating the same lines from Gladiator over and over, making jokes about "Trajan's Column", and pondering why tourists would take photos next to the Arch of Titus, which signified the deification of the Emperor Titus, whose major accomplishment was invading and sacking the City of Jerusalem, burning down the Jewish Temple, and pilfering a menorah from the Temple.  The Island of Capri was rich, but NOBODY there had ever heard of Capri Sun, which is weird, because Capri Sun is clearly the best thing ever to emerge from the Island of Capri, if not from Italy herself.

      Like a baby's first steps, or like Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon solving a particularly difficult puzzle, hellcourts part deux's first picture is something to remember.  I applaud thee, Joel, for providing it.  I just went to my third Cubs game in three days.  Although Nomah went o for 5, the Cubbies completed a clean sweep of the hometown Rockies.  'Twas sweet.  In other news, I return from Denver on the 17th in the morn, and if anyone wants to hang out that night I would be more than happy.  But for now, I must bid you OUTS.  (adieu)  Sincerely,  Nomah.

Do not underestimate him.    2) Whence I spoke with you a while back on the topic of something to see in Seattle, I failed to mention the sight that Jack and I saw there while on holiday last year. Make sure to check this hot and happening place out. It's near the water, if I recall correctly.

      Yo dudes, I am using the internet in Seattle and just wanted to say hey and that I have not been killed by any mountain-men (yet). Sweet posts over the past few days!! Sweet stories all around - flowers, whitey almost shooting some dude in the face, frames and mattes, dharma and greg, stasi's pink socks... and fucking Castillo! THAT GUY IS HILARIOUS, and incredibly quick-witted! I never would have thought to say something so funny. Ok, I am out to go try and see a bunch of salmon try to swim upstream in a river (Whitey may liken that to watching 3 monkeys try to fuck a football. Landon, on the other hand, would liken it to watching someone try and put socks on an octopus).

      I must proclaim myself the Cypriot King, as I have acquired, for my firm, A State Department Contract to study the EU referenda in Cyprus!  I am very excited, as this means I may go to Cyprus.  I definitely would go if not for the impending law school coursework, but for now, let me bask in my own glory.   I saw Blue!  He looked GLORIOUS!

      I am trying to cut down on my blogging so I don't become addicted but hearing about Bagel at a Cubs game rehashed a fond olde memory of mine.  Lemme set the stage.  It is a wonderful summer afternoon at Wrigley. Interleague play has just begun.  Bagel has invited me to the game along with Chairman and Sendlak, (whom I just recently saw in court).  Greg Ruthless also has tickets along the first base side right next to the White Sox bullpen with my sinister Uncle Fred(named so for the pencil-thin mustache he has groomed since before there were pencils).  Around the 6th inning, myself and Bagel move down to GR's seats to visit for a half inning, and White Sox reliever Carlos Castillo is warming up in the bullpen.  Bagel begins some good natured heckling, getting a chuckle out of GR.  Castillo responds in no manner to the heckling initially even though Bagel is about 15 feet from him.  Castillo doesn't even look over in Bagel's direction which leads me to believe A)Castillo is deaf   or B)  perhaps Castillo doesn't understand English.  Bagel has now continued the heckling about Castillo's Earned Run Average, (or simply ERA as myself and Mr. Stava would call it), for far too long.  Shouting what is your ERA, CASTILLO, 5.50, What is it Castillo...5.50.  After about the 5th time Bagel asks What is your ERA Castillo, 5.50, Castillo catches the ball back from his bullpen catcher and looks over at Bagel and says........5.50?  That's about what you make an hour, right?    Vintage Bagel.

      Sorry for not posting yesterday.  As I'm sure all of you know, I don't really give an F about speed metal.  I was also really busy at work.  More importantly, the Chi-town Cubs are coming to Denver for a 3 game against the Rockies.  I will be attending all three games and yelling at Nomah in an obnoxious Boston accent.  I definitely looking forward to it.  More later.  outz.

      i would like to note that while reading Stasi's post about speed metal bands, 2 things happened: 1) Deftones started playing on my random mp3 iTunes list. 2) It started raining, cancelling my scheduled bike ride.    2 shitty things!   My compliments on your pink socks though.

      Stasi, you subconsciously wore the pink socks.  They will relax your patient, and he will open up to you and in turn be more receptive to your efforts.  Pure genius on your part.

      Joel, I tend to agree with most things you say; however, I cannot believe that you stated that speed metal sucks.  Where would I be today if it wasn't for Nuclear Assault, Testament, Anthrax, Exodus, and Kreator?   I'll tell you where: Probably sitting in some boarded up building counting the minutes until my next fix.  (wait, that is probably what would have happened if I would have continued to listen to speed metal)  On a lighter note, I am at the hospital waiting for my first patient and just noticed that my socks (which I believed to be light brown when I put them on this morning) are actually pink.  These must be the ones that I put in the washer with my red shirt.

      Whitey, sweet post about the dude you almost shot in the face (I assume that you would have shot him in the face).  Right after I read it, I was all, "Damn that would have been sweet if I was there because I would have taken the AR-15 or shotgun out of the car and then I would have been running around Carol Stream with either an assault rifle or a shotgun, either of which would remind me of my favourite TV character, Jack Bauer a.k.a. Kiefer Sutherland of 24.    While you nancy boys have been gardening, I have been doing man's work and getting frames, mattes, and posters.  Yes, it's true, I am a decorating genius.  Bagel, I am also tuned in to what is totally hot right now in Philly suburban style, so if you need me to decorate your apt., you know, the one in the suburbs of Philly, just let me know.  Today I went to the custom framing shop D'etre (shout out to Chairman and speaking French) and bought a frame for a poster I have that is 40"x55" a.k.a. fucking huge.  I had to buy plexiglass (looks real though) for that shit, because regular glass would have weighed almost as much as whitey when he was on his fat... I mean "muscle" diet, a.k.a. 15-18 eggs a day.  Later,  Joel a.k.a. the AK-man a.k.a. "Shoeshine McGillicutty, the Shoeshinin' Man"  P.S.  Speed metal sucks.

      whitey, sounds like you have quite the green thumb these days. the tough part will be deciding what to grow and how to keep alive the plants you've grown to enjoy throughout the wintry months. however, with some daily watering and the adequate amount of nutrients (don't forget that tender loving care), you'd be surprised to find that many species of common household flora can survive on a yearly basis. related to nearly shooting a gangbanger, i almost made the mistake of watering my favorite flowers at mid-day. a big no no. adding water on top of flowers when the sun is strongest risks burning your favorite foliage. i should remind myself to water them around 8 or 9 am or in the early evening. it also conserves water for your neighborhood. finally, i think i should now scrape the black paint off of my many anti-tank missiles in case coppers mistake them for simply black carrying cases for canvas paintings.
