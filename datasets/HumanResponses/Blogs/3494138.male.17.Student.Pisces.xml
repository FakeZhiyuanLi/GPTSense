      I can't seem to fall asleep tonight.  Rough stuff, and I'm no insomniac.  Busy day at work today, figured I'd be tired enough to crash hard, but it doesn't seem so.  I watched School of Rock just for shits and giggles.  Gave me something to do to pass the time.  I love that movie.  Wish I could play the guitar like Zach.  Actually, I wish I could play the guitar period.  Hehehe......oh well.  I'll stick to the drums for now.  I wanna learn some more complex stuff, but I really just need my own set to experiment with.  Kinda big investment, tho.  Don't know if I'm ready for that.  Maybe someday down the road.....anyways, I always gain a better appreciation for rock and roll after watching that movie.  Led Zep, Pink Floyd, The Who, The Doors, Deep Purple, all great stuff.  Coolest part of the movie is when he first teaches them to play.  I love when the keyboard guy learns Touch Me by The Doors.  Great song.  Hmmmmmmm......maybe The Doors will help me get to sleep........I'll try it.  peace

      Me and a bunch of my friends went out and had some fun last night.  My really good friend Nick is moving to Arizona and we wanted to give it one last go before he leaves.  I'm so sad.  Really cool guy.  Very creative and very funny.  Comes up with the craziest shit.  Last night, we were at In 'N Out, and we saw this van that said "Reliable Transportation" on the side.  So Nick suggests that we slash its tires and sue the company cuz they're van wouldn't be reliable anymore.  We were laughing so hard, cuz with Nick everything is done half-serious and half-jokingly.  Then we went to an arcade and we all tried that crazy dancing game with the stepping pad thingy.  That was hilarious, too.  We all suck.  People were laughing.  Oh well.....we were laughing with them.  We had lotsa fun.  Damn, I sure am gonna miss these good times......

      .....i finally set up a blog.  Dont know what the hell i'm gonna do with it, but at least now i gots a place to rant and rave about all sorts of crazy bullshit.  like right now, im watchin game 1 of the lakers/pistons nba finals series.  s'pretty good, so far.  i really think detroit's got a legitimate chance to win this series.  they're doin what i think they should do: defend hard, and force bryant to be a ball hog and take bad shots.  anyways, im gonna keep watchin.  peace
