      Im back in black, not realy my shirt is blue but that doesnt matter soooo people this could be a long post so get ready for this. We dont have school tommorow because it is cold pffft too cold ive never heard of something so stupid a "cold day" what about the people how live in alaska do they have cold days i bet not they just bundle into there eskimo costumes and their all set. Thats what we need we just all need to dress like eskimos if i was an eskimo i would eat whale blubber. Blubber is funny word Say that three times fast. You know what else is a funny word quaternary guess what that means well i dont feel like telling you. If i knew why people can be so stupid i could probably save the world from all evil stupidity is the root of all evil non the less i dont know why. Why are some blonds stupid. of the building     the time was to short for me to tell     if what i was seeing could realy be     by the time i comprehended i finaly fell     a blond being smart was a story to tell     i told all the world all the fishes in the sea     all them acted the same they just laughed at me     and said this blond could not be  A poem about blondes for someone who can spell that so yeah what else can i say its not late enuogh for me to be writing here i write more later

      Do you know whats not funny. Insomniac it the worst show ever. But that aside its not funny. I could make a show where i stay up all night but there would be less drinking.  My monitor isnt yellow anymore because i put a new one on my computer so now i can see the colors they are so vibrant.  the new brightnes that has befallen me like a giant shroud of colors the screen engulfs my face i sit and stare in awe it is so beautiful to me once it was dull and lifeless like the moon without the sun but now i see what colors can do to forge the light and destroy the dark  a poem about the new monitor.  nobody expects the spanish inquisition  are you suggesting the cocunuts migrate  yes, yes i am  ok boredom  people should read this and be enlightened about the world and all my knowledge. I know all. Except for not all. GOt it good.  but seriously  i dont know what it means to be stupid or smart or blonde   the dog knows evil  i bored ill tell a story  There was a time when evil ruled the world. The evil came in form of snails. THeir shells were inpenertable and the speed was to fast for anyone to follow. But once during the reign of evil an uprising was led by several ducks. They worked in seceret and buit an army that could finaly stand against the evil snails force. The ducks were finaly ready to attalk. In the dark of night the ducks moved in. They marched all the way to the  city of snailsdom and the battle began. The snails were prepared for the attack they clashed with the ducks the battle ended and the ducks were vitorious then the ducks were evil and humans beat them and thats were we are today.  nice yeah done

        This is what the government would be if i ruled a country. I think land should be evenly divided between the citizens and everyone should be equal. Money should be equaly divided between all citizens and everyone should be employed based on their skills. Now you could call this communism but in theory it works as long as there is no corrupt leaders. To choose a leader the citizens would still elect him but i would eliminate political parties so there would be less arguments between nominees. They could still voice their views but they wouldnt be named a this or that. Ill work out the kinks later.    So besides that Danmcvetys birthday party was fun today. Our video we made went great it was the best hit of the party(we watched it three times). I thought i did an excellent job playing a ninja and dan mcvetys girlfriend. But best lead role goes to Bill playing dan Mcvety what a funny video.     "no danmcvety has a match on danmcvety"     "bigerphy"     "i doooooooo"     "are you going to do your sax solo"     "sheiser"     "yo betusmcfetus"     "im afraid shes pregnant"     "your not em"

        I have been thinking a lot lately about how I would rule society. First (since many wars are fought based on religion) I would have to unite the world under one religion. Many people would be against that and many people would fight against it. But once my armies had destroyed the uprisings we would all be united under one religion. That brings me to my next point how can people get along when they live so far away from each other. I would create a new massive continent called Oneland.Comunication would be easy and no one would need to leave the country. That's another thing, the world would be one country so there would be no land disputes. Everyone would also share a land equally divided to make wars over land impossible. All resources would be evenly distributed and since some jobs are more difficult than others people would be paid based on the difficulty work they do. The only competition in the world would be to get a better education and a better job. Race also causes fighting amongst humans, I know this sounds bad but I would have to make the world one race. How I would create this one race is that I would combine all the features of every race on earth into one. Don't you think that's a little better than the way the Germans thought during the holocaust. To govern each section of the world I would have a clone of myself. Those are just the basic foundations of my world.   50 firt dates sucked or at least i think so It never ended he just had to make her remember him every day unless wait  i think i figured it out just know actualy she could remember him only slightly in her dreams now i understand sorry to those who havent seen it yet but it angered me.

       I hate dishes i dont think they should exist. Without them the world would be a much better place think of the water that would be conserved and saved for later generations some countries dont hace any fresh clean water to drink and if people werent so busy washing dishes and wasting water they might hae water to drink without them having to boil it.

        On the eleventh day of the third month in the year of two thousand and four the first sign of the beatle fell from the heavens. It came to us in the form of primitive righting around a hoop. At that time i and my apostles began to follow the will of the great beatle.At this timwe were happy we recited the prayers of the Beatle and rejoiced in his glory. Soon we came to a fork in the road, we had to choose right or the left. One follower broke away claiming the Beatle to have spoken to him and tol him to follow the path alone. I continued right. I feared the Badger of the underworld may have led me astray. I returned to my home and spoke with the betrayer. His words had convinced and engaged me in a nonstop battle against the forces of the badger of the underworld.

        Right know its 11:00 and I'm supposed to be sleeping because I have sats tomorrow but I cant sleep now.   Anyway I have been reading people journals and I've decided that a lot of people are depressed. I don't really understand why. I'm not ever depressed at all, I'm not always happy but I'm always indifferent to whatever is happening. I guess some people have things to be upset about and I guess I really don't have any problems to worry about.   Everyone   watch aqua teen hunger force

       Well its 12:57 am right now and i have to get to school for 7:30 tommorow for the memorial day parade. So lets do the math thats about six and a half hours from now. Oh and by the way Bill i read you journal so if you read this know that i do read it. Im not realy tired right now and i dont know when im going to go to sleep. Today was my dads birthday and we went to a redsox game.             Oh god the south park movie is on.  Anyway in the stands at the game it seemed like it was realy hot for the 12 innings the game lasted.  Then after the game We all went to the Saint ritas festival at oakland beach. The maurices went in the van and we meaning Me,Ian,Ryan,Bill,and Alicia went in his car and couldnt find a parking spot for half an hour that was fun even though i could never get shot gun.  Our band eight dollar car sounds realy good. I wanted to record us on friday but the tape recorder wasnt working so i didnt. We can play two songs now, i know thats a massive set but its a good start. That was also our first full practice with the entire six piece band.

         Ah so today i have pretty much gotten over my sickness which has kept me couch ridden and vomiting for four days.      Who wants to start a new country with me? This country is ruined and we have a president that speaks like bill writes his essays. so we all need to just start a new country without war, poverty,hunger,and anything else that is wrongful.A world where we all follow the biddings of the beetle and do whatever his glory commands. If we are to do the world will be cured of the evil that dwells among us.     Gaspee Parade tommorow hopefuly i shall be entirely cured by then. When i went to the doctors yesterday they stuck things down my throat,  and needles in my vains it was fun. When i got my blood taken out for the test they were doin i laughed and the doctor made fun of me because i shaked will the whole time there was a needle in me taking out blood but needles make me laugh they tickle. So at the doctors place the strep test came back negative and the mono test was also negative so by process of illimination of course i had sypa loppa itis osis.       And now i leave you with the words of ben franklin     "If your head is made of wax dont walk in the sun."

      the world is alive warm and squirming around for it is evil  haiku  anyway today we went to graduation rehersal in the morning and we sat there and played for maybe a few minutes then left. Then we went back to school for the rest of the day where me and bill made ice cream in chemistry class ours didnt come out so great not because the ice cream was mostly liquid, it was that we had about ten pounds of chocolate chips in our solution. Then after that i went home for a while put on my tuxedo and went back to school to do the real graduation. And that was pretty much my entire day.

        LET us go then, you and I,   When the evening is spread out against the sky   Like a patient etherised upon a table;   Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,   The muttering retreats         5  Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels   And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:   Streets that follow like a tedious argument   Of insidious intent   To lead you to an overwhelming question …         10  Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”   Let us go and make our visit.      In the room the women come and go   Talking of Michelangelo.      The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,         15  The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes   Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,   Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,   Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,   Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,         20  And seeing that it was a soft October night,   Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.      And indeed there will be time   For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,   Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;         25  There will be time, there will be time   To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;   There will be time to murder and create,   And time for all the works and days of hands   That lift and drop a question on your plate;         30  Time for you and time for me,   And time yet for a hundred indecisions,   And for a hundred visions and revisions,   Before the taking of a toast and tea.      In the room the women come and go         35  Talking of Michelangelo.      And indeed there will be time   To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”   Time to turn back and descend the stair,   With a bald spot in the middle of my hair—         40  [They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”]   My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,   My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin—   [They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”]   Do I dare         45  Disturb the universe?   In a minute there is time   For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.      For I have known them all already, known them all:—   Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,         50  I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;   I know the voices dying with a dying fall   Beneath the music from a farther room.     So how should I presume?      And I have known the eyes already, known them all—         55  The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,   And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,   When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,   Then how should I begin   To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?         60    And how should I presume?      And I have known the arms already, known them all—   Arms that are braceleted and white and bare   [But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]   It is perfume from a dress         65  That makes me so digress?   Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.     And should I then presume?     And how should I begin?       .      .      .      .      .   Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets         70  And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes   Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?…      I should have been a pair of ragged claws   Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.       .      .      .      .      .   And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!         75  Smoothed by long fingers,   Asleep … tired … or it malingers,   Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.   Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,   Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?         80  But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,   Though I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,   I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter;   I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,   And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,         85  And in short, I was afraid.      And would it have been worth it, after all,   After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,   Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,   Would it have been worth while,         90  To have bitten off the matter with a smile,   To have squeezed the universe into a ball   To roll it toward some overwhelming question,   To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,   Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”—         95  If one, settling a pillow by her head,     Should say: “That is not what I meant at all.     That is not it, at all.”      And would it have been worth it, after all,   Would it have been worth while,         100  After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,   After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—   And this, and so much more?—   It is impossible to say just what I mean!   But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:         105  Would it have been worth while   If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,   And turning toward the window, should say:     “That is not it at all,     That is not what I meant, at all.”       .      .      .      .      .         110  No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;   Am an attendant lord, one that will do   To swell a progress, start a scene or two,   Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,   Deferential, glad to be of use,         115  Politic, cautious, and meticulous;   Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;   At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—   Almost, at times, the Fool.      I grow old … I grow old …         120  I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.      Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?   I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.   I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.      I do not think that they will sing to me.         125     I have seen them riding seaward on the waves   Combing the white hair of the waves blown back   When the wind blows the water white and black.      We have lingered in the chambers of the sea   By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown         130  Till human voices wake us, and we drown.
