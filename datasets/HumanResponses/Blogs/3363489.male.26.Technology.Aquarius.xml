      Hi guys! Hows it going?   I just thought I'd send you an update about what I've been up to.   After 4 years Our youth pastors are leaving to return to Taraunga, New Zealand. At the moment there are 3 of us leaders who have been trained to learn how to do the job of a youth pastor, so if something like this happens the whole program doesn't colapses. If anyone is from NZ you might be able to catch up with them... Their names are Andy & Shelly Turner, and they will be pastoring a church. At the same time I'm happy but sad coz it gives me a chance to step up to the Microphone (So to speak).   Today is National Athiests Day or April Fools Day.... we done a prank that was funny and not funny at the same time.  We went to the church last night and moved all the chairs into the new auditorium that is being built and took some photos which I will email when I get them... Our pastor didn't think it was funny coz they are in a hurry to get the building opened by easter... but there were others who thought it was. Why? you may ask? I didn't really want to but there was another youth leader there who came up with the idea and the youth were wanting me to get in on the joke... I know some of you may think that I'm trying to pass the blame onto someone else when its true... anywho its all back to normal.   Our youth program has taken off.. we have been asked in our school outreach to run a breakfast program my a new nurse in there starting Term 2... Term 3 we could be running extra curiculm activities in the school..God is amazing   Our youth are in preparation mode at the moment. Every second saturday we have a night called YC4G or Youth Called 4 God where we break into 2 teams: Music and Dance... I'm in charge of the Music Team... What an Honour. Every Wednesday night is Youth Devotions/Bible Study were we've been looking at Prayer next terms focus is on The Lost.    We are taking our youth into the slums of Bendigo... the area where there is high unemployment and drugs and so on... we are going to hire a building coz the council wants groups that will benefit the community and the hire is for free! We found this out after we were thinking about that same building!   Mikes Thoughts: Welcome to another edition of My 2 cents... you may recognise me from such other...... ok ok its a little too corny but I thought I'd share with you some stuff that God has layed upon my heart.    The youth were given a Prayer Journal at the end of last year to record their thoughts about what God was speaking to them about... I've been doing the same and God told me that thats were I'm gonna get my sermons from.   I'm just copying word from word my notes or otherwise I will be here all night.. you might be able to make sense of it. If you have any queries or coments just reply to me... As the Music Leader in the youth God has been specifically speaking to me about Worship so I've been doing a study on the whole aspect of it  Worshipping in spirit and truth:   30/3/03   Psalm 141:1-5 Worship means to Pay Homage   Worship is Obedience Disobedience is Sin   John 4:23 But the hour is coming, and now is, whe the true worshippers will worship the Father in SPIRIT and TRUTH, for the Father is seeking such to worship Him   v24: God is Spirit, and those who  worship Him must worship in spirit and truth --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John 4:23 But the hour is coming, and now is, whe the true worshippers (Obeyers) will worship (Obey) the Father in SPIRIT and TRUTH, for the Father is seeking such to worship (Obey) Him   v24: God is Spirit, and those who  worship (Obey) Him must worship (Obey) in spirit and truth   Obey is Spirit and Truth? Being "in the spirit" can only come from intimacy with God (love affair), Understanding /knowing God's cry/heart. The spirit ins another dimension unseen. Therefore we obey so we don't quench the Holy Spirit and sin. Eph 4:30   OBEDIENCE BRINGS GODLY FEAR or GODLINESS   1. Godliness: eusebeia: means to be devout, well pleasing to Him = (See #2) Titus 1- The truth which is according to Godliness is that which is prductive of godliness 1 Tim 3:16: The mystery of godliness   ACTS OF GODLINESS 2 Pet 3:11 (Plural) Notice HOLY conduct and Godliness   2. Theosebia = The feaor of reverence of God. THEOS = God. Also see #3 in worshipper section.   3. Theosebes: "God Fearing" John 9:31, the first worshipper Gen 22 Sin is disobedience Does his will = Obedience   WORSHIPER: 1. Prostunetes (4353), akin to proskuno, see John 4:23 2. Neokoros (3511) is translated "Worshiper" in Acts 19:38 and also TEMPLE KEEPER - We are temples of the Holy Spirit: 1 Cor 3:16, 1 Cor 6:19, Eph 2:21 3. Theosebes: (2318) denotes "Reverencing God Theos: God "Worshiper of God" in John 9:35 Theosebia: "Godliness" 1 Tim 2:10 Psalm 119:34 - Understanding of God comes through intimacy with God   MIKES GOD NOTE TO SELF: Music is AN outward _expression to the maker of what He's done and and _expression of Intimacy... INTIMACY THEN WORSHIP ->Sacrifices MUSIC IS NOT WORSHIP JUST AN _EXPRESSION!     PSALM 119:44/45 Keep your law continually (24/7) Forever and Ever AND I will walk at Liberty For I seek Your Precepts What are Gods Precepts Law Principle Foundation Origin Source Ultimate Cause Axiom: (Fundamental Principles) Maxim   MIKES GOD NOTE TO SELF: There is freedom in Submission There is Bondage in Rebellion (Gen 4)   First worshiper: Gen 22   MIKES GOD NOTE TO SELF: Greater the Obedience The Greater the Faith The Greater the (true) faith The greater the obedience THE GREATER THE WORSHIP THAT WILL BLESS GODS HEART   Psalm 32:3-5: When David kept silent in resistance to God the inner struggle of conscience and conviction drained away the very VITALITY of life. The when he said"I will confess my transgretions, then God forgave See 1 John 1:9   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Apart from YC4G, This weekend I will be watching the V8 Supercars.
