       urlLink Melly's  story on Vik and Weiqiang really tickles me.  Reminds me of my Tyn Long. The boys were discussing their proposal for an upcoming Innovation and Enterprise project. Interested in selling Western food, the boys were told that there's not much value added to French Fries on their own. Tyn Long came up with a brilliant plan - to serve fries with self-made special sauce. LYCHEE SAUCE, which has "LYCHEE syrup, two portions of chilli sauce, two portions of ketchup and two portions of mustard". Just about all the types of sauce (/syrup)he knows, I bet. I hope no one throws up.  Second day of school - and I've been asked to coordinate the cluster WITS presentation tomorrow. Not forgetting the IRS coordinator-ship (Individualised Research Study) that I shall take over very soon. I'm a workaholic (who stays in school till it closes everyday) but not a very confident one at this moment. Hmmmph...  Still exhausted. Met Gerard on my way home and we hung out for a while. Now, I'm more exhausted than I was in the past two days and have decided to dump my work for a good night's rest.  GOOD night! :)

      Before the day started, I felt the zeal in me bursting with thoughts of "School, here I come!".  Now that the day's nearing the end, I can hardly feel my feet and my eyes are half opened from exhaustion. I really ought to get more sleep to recharge. During dinner conversation with Fadzli, I've realised that I'd need to sleep in at 10pm to get 7 hours of rest before I start my day at 5am everyday. Hmmmm... It's 10.30pm now and I have tons to do before tomorrow. *Oops*  Melly and I met briefly in town after school just now. We had our "teachers' spree" at Popular Bookstore, getting equipped stationerily (and stationarily in more ways than one!) for school. Then at around 7pm, I met up with Fadzli who was such a dear friend today to have helped me with my heavy stuff from town and to have gone back to Causeway Point to get more files before setting me for home... Thanks. Really.  School wasn't bad at all, actually. I met the boys from the two classes I'd be teaching English to. 14 in one, and 13 in the other. Active and playful - but I'm glad that these children who are supposed to be Singapore's top 1% (intellectually) have a brighter side to them than the stereotypes often imposed. Children, as children are, are still so adorable no matter how difficult they can be.  I've been told that I'd be taking on the full load of teaching from Thursday and I'm not sure if I'm well-prepared. But I suppose I'd NEVER be too well-prepared and so I'm only left with  THE PLUNGE . I've been blessed though (as always), that I've been and would be given guidance by mentors till I am confident to take off on my own. Such a luxury, is not something many beginning teachers are blessed with.   I think it'd all work out, as things always do for me. As Gerard always adds, "things  have a way of working out,  eventually ".

       Good morning.   I suppose I haven't been very good at sticking to the retraining of my biological clock.  Just got back from Wala Wala - a usual Friday night out with Sam, Mel, Melly and Nat. It was great, as usual.  I LOVE my friends!  They are so so... lovable. ;) Just like my  urlLink rock star , Rai. Besides Chris Lee, I have another soft spot for lil rock star. Now that work's gonna start for real, we'd probably see less and less of each other. Letz then, make time for each other, eh?   Tonight, I've been given new names on two occasions:   One  Stranger: Eh, you're still here, Wati?  Me: Wati? I'm not Wati. I'm Siti. Stranger: Oh... wrong person. Are you sure you were not from St. Margaret's Pri? You look very familiar. They had a reunion downstairs. Me: Huh? No lah. Catholic High.  ~ Stranger was obviously not very sober. He looked disappointed that I was not "Wati" (not that I'm "Siti" either, actually) but he certainly had no clue that Catholic High is a boys' school. Poor stranger.   Two  Waiter: I saw you in Malaysia some weeks back! I was racing with this car and I turned around and saw  Wala Wala girl . ... ~ I now know that waiter's name is Raj, and that Melly, Nat, Rai, Raj and I are gonna have some trip to Malaysia sometime (though perhaps Melly, Rai and I should really disappear during the trip :P).  I also now know that besides "Rita", I'm also known as "Wati" and "Wala Wala girl". Other names (which might be worse) are yet to be known to me, though I'm pretty curious for now.   I really must have that common a face.

      Back on the Fancl supplements - Keita has translated (from the Japanese written on the pack) the ingredients of the 7 pills:      "the ingredients are as follows.... - vitamins B & C - vitamin E - calcium & magnesium - coenzyme - zinc - HTC collagen - iron ...."  Not too bad, I thought. At least they'd keep me on  my feet a while longer than I have been able to.  Late nights the past few days - mostly because I've been used to sleeping late in Japan. And so, having to set my biological clock back to routine has been difficult. [Explains the dark rings]  Attended a meeting at the GE HQ (Gifted Education Headquarters) this afternoon. Although the briefing seemed overwhelming, it gave me some direction to grope along this dark path I am about to uptake.  Talking about dark - I attempted to dye my faded favourite black sweater today. A couple of weeks back, I cleared half my wardrobe of the clothes I've hardly worn the past two years. Packed these into bags for the family maids to send back to their villages. I gave away some new clothes only worn once or twice or not at all, but no longer suit my sense now. But I kept my favourite and faded clothes, which I no longer wear but would love to. After dedicating five hours to my sweater, it seems to look pretty much the same. Perhaps my fingers had taken on more dye than my sweater did. Damn.  Still in the dark, Always in the dark...

      Okasan got me a set of supplements and cosmetics from  urlLink Fancl .  Here's the bag of supplements with  90 packets  of  7 pills each  to be consumed in  ONE  day. Wohoa! Little wonder why I'm still so awake after a long day of unpacking and running of errands. Also met Fadzli for dinner and we caught   urlLink Best Bet  . I have a soft spot for  urlLink Christopher Lee  ;) but other than that, and the pockets of hilarious local humour, I think Jack Neo has produced better movies.  ... for the woman in me ...  urlLink

       I'm Back!   It is really nice to be home. Missed my family and friends to bits...  *squeeze their cheeks*  And now, I've begun to miss Japan and the people I've left.  Damn it! Such a binary would just mean that I'd be missing some dear people at every point of my life!  Japan was  FANTABULOUS , as always. I believe having great people around in a place so foreign really helps. Keita's family is a joy to be with. They always make me feel so welcomed and loved. Here are some photos of us.  ... my second family and i on fathers' day ... (from left)   1st photo  - Ryohei (Keita's elder brother), [tired] me, Otosan (what I address Keita's father, which means 'father' in Japanese) & Okasan ('mother' in Japanese);  2nd photo & 3rd photo  - Keita and Okasan during our tea break from shopping! :);  4th photo  - Keita, me, Otosan & Okasan   urlLink     We spent my last day in Tokyo  SHOPPING !  Okasan spent time with Keita and I at  urlLink Ginza , one of Tokyo's busiest shopping areas - shop after shop, we shopped and shopped, from  Tiffany  to  Burberry  to  Fancl  to ...   Okasan and I, were of course only too happy to try on jewellery and bags and clothes, while Keita patiently joined us in our indulges. *hugs*   EIGHT  hours later, here's a photo of Keita and I -  ... exhausted us @ tokyo's ginza ...   urlLink     We managed to catch some breath and hang out with friends, though. Keita and I met up with Mika and Sun, whom we knew from the 5th  urlLink HYLI  (which was also where Keita and I met two years ago). I believe Mika, Sun, Keita and I haven't met for more than a year, and so it was really nice to have met them.   Mika has just started working as a consultant at  Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu  and Sun (who is Thai) is now SPONSORED (lucky boy!) by the Japanese government to take a postgrad course in Tokyo. I also met up with Dom (aka Tiwat) when I was in Bangkok. He too has just returned from England and started working. Still as charming as ever, I must say ;). Seeing all my friends doing well and going places, it warms my heart that we are still very much in touch despite the distance and differences.  ... hanging out ...

      ... glee ...  urlLink     How wonderful it would be, if life could be like this everyday.  Waking up to served breakfast, taking morning walks by the sea, shopping without having to worry about budget, treating my hair and nails to spa, fine dining everyday, ...  It won't be long, I'm afraid. It'd all end soon... soon...

      An ex tennis teammate of Keita's has been calling him lately... whom he said "to have been described by some to be beautiful".  Today, I saw photos of Asami. She looks a lot like  urlLink Michelle Saram  and is now a broadcast journalist in one of Japan's leading news channels. What the ****  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmph

      Hello from Japan!  Tokyo is warmer than I thought it was but  urlLink Aomori  is colder than I thought it could be. The weather in Tokyo somewhat differs from that of last year's spring... but cooler than Singapore, nonetheless.  I came down with a fever this afternoon, perhaps from a whole day of little food, flight after flight and wide temperature difference from that of Bangkok. It was not a high fever, though. Just a bad throat and a small increase in temperature BUT my dear boyfriend panicked that my temperature had increased by 2.3 degrees, that he sent me to the "Accident and Emergency" department of a local hospital! I didn't know he thought it was THAT serious, until I saw patients with blood and crying babies (and adults). It was INDEED a place for "accidents and emergencies".  Although I felt a little embarrassed when the doctor said that "itz just a common cold and LOW LEVEL fever", my heart felt so warm seeing how much Keita cared for me. In many ways, Keita reminds me of Daddy... his devotion to the people he loves at the expense of himself, his firm beliefs and principles that do not stagger in the midst of adversity, his passion for life and in living which makes him such a perfect companion to have in adverse and happy moments...  When I was dating Choon Seng some years back, I thought that it would be hard for me to love anyone more than I loved him... and thus, I told myself that when I do find this someone who can sweep me away from the deeply rooted love I had for Choon Seng, this would be the man I'd want to marry. Keita is that one man I hope I would grow old with... besides my dearest family and darling friends, he is another I simply can't live without. Two years of being together, and it still feels like the first day we started dating...   ... my sweetest keita ...  urlLink     I am thankful to God, that even if Daddy has to leave me one day, his legacy stays my side... (and vice versa)

      Almost ten years ago, I grew closer to a group of four girls I got to know in  urlLink school . Today, a decade after, we still remain pretty much the best of friends but this friendship has not been one without hiccups.  Often, when we go through our rough patches, friends would ask me   "Tell me again, why are you still friends with them?"   At those junctures, it had been difficult for me to answer these friends. But the weekend that has just passed (we took a break in Thailand together) shed some light to this clueless soul.   I am best of friends with Natalie Koh, Lim Chiu Hsia, Cherrie Lim and Elaine Tan   ~  BECAUSE I simply can't live without them...    simply because.   Cheers to this group of lovers I just can't live without!  ... me bestest friends ... (from left)  Cher, Chiu Hsia, Nat, Me & Elaine   urlLink

      Am at the airport, trying to kill time. Was so delighted to find this Internet kiosk, which allows passengers 15 mins of access time.  But as I type, I begin to wonder... What an IT-olic I am!!! Gosh! I packed light this time - giving up my multiple pairs of pants, skirts, hats, sweaters and what-nots BUT still included my lappy (& accessories!), palmy, etc. Hmmmm... I can never get enough of technology, can I??? Ouch.  Still half-asleep but am so glad that I'm finally off to Bangkok to meet girlfriends Elaine, Nat, Chiu Hsia & soon-to-be-mummy Cher. I'd probably have dinner with the Thai guys from the  urlLink HYLI  programme - Tiwat, Frank and Woody... The rest of the time in Thailand, I hope to spend on myself and with myself...   ...Sometimes, I just need to be alone...

      Malacca was great!!! Great company, great place, great food, wohoa!  For this contemporary society, I have a huge family. Two married elder sisters and a younger one. Three nephews from the first sis, and a nephew and a niece (with an upcoming third in 6 months!) from the second one. And so, even excluding the half-developed child in my sis' tummy, there are 13 of us! It is little wonder that we have so much fun when we're together. We didn't do much, actually. No golf for the men, no theme park for the children,no shopping for the women but PURE HANGING OUT in the house - half the time out of the house and in the pool. It was indeed a treat. :) I spent so many hours under the sun that my skin tone is two shades darker and itz not something I like parading around in because I don't get a nice golden tan, just dark dark. Keita's mum is going to pile a new set of whitening cream for me when I see her in a couple of days. ;)  What was not so great was the trip back to Singapore. Because I had much packing to do and errands to run and Tae Kwon Do training to attend, my younger sis (Melur) and I left Malacca earlier than everyone else. We were left with no choice, but to take a 7-hour train back to Singapore since all the buses and express trains were fully booked. And it did turn out to be one looooong train ride. Midway, an announcement was made (translated from Malay) "We regret to inform you that the train's engine has broken down. It would take us some time to solve this problem. We thank you for your patience. Thank you for travelling with KTM." Boy did they take SOME TIME! What could have been a two-hour drive back home turned out to be a ten-hour train ride home. I could only be glad that it was a train, and not an aeroplane. Imagine the same announcement in the midst of flight!  Flying off to Bangkok in five hours. So afraid I'd miss my flight, I've decided not to sleep but I foresee an even more tired me tomorrow. Hope I'd be able to make the best of my couple of days in Bangkok, before I fly off to Japan to meet my beloved Keita and Okasan and Otosan and cute Ryohei-san (Keita's brother)! ;)

      ... my family - the loves of my life ...  urlLink     In a couple of hours, I'd be in the car to Malacca for a couple of days. My entire immediate family would be taking a break at the family's holiday bungalow in  urlLink A'famosa . Given everyone's busy busy schedule, it is always nice to have such retreats. I'm sure it'd be a blast! Pity I have to return earlier than everyone else, to settle the little details before I fly off on Sunday morning.  Would also be missing my Friday night out at Wala Wala, and I probably won't get to meet Nat, Sam, Kumz and Melly till I return from my trip.   *Missing My Little Chocolates*

      Itz been quite a week. The conference was over on Saturday and as much as I believed it was pedagogically useful, it was SUPER tiring for me to get up early every morning, spend an entire day listening to presentations, carry on with my activities in the evening and return home late to savour the few hours of sleep. I did figure, though, that life's gonna be like that for me for a long long time when I start working. So I might as well get used to it.  Hasli's (my cousin) wedding was over the weekend. Before I could take some time to recuperate, I was busy entertaining my uncles, aunties, cousins, nephews, etc. who were back from overseas to attend the wedding. I also missed Nazreen's wedding, after making myself believe that I had forgotten about it. Truth is, I really didn't wish to see Vel and be faced with awkwardness. I was actually thinking of going with Rai so as to reduce the awkwardness but either way, I'd have seen Vel and that's something I might not be ready for. I just have this "natural talent" for screwing up relationships with my guy friends. Mel calls me "gifted" in this area. ;) One after another... it just happens again and again. :( Regardless, I feel bad about Nazreen and have sent her a wedding gift to apologise.  And so, I was really only left with Monday to recover from the long long week I've had. Met up with Fadzli for dinner, and Natasha joined us thereafter. Having had enough with the mess Fadzli and I had been in the past month, we talked it out. It was good, really, to have it all out in the open. I think it must have been just as frustrating for him, as it was for me. I'm not sure if it'd be the same from now... but I sure do miss the times when our friendship was less complicated and easygoing. I blame this all on my "natural talent"!!! Though deep inside, I know that this is something I have to work on since the problem clearly lies with me and not with all the guys.  I'm SUPER glad, though, for the time I spent with my  urlLink *rock star*  last night. Rai and I haven't gone out for some time, although we have been in touch often and see much of each other at Wala Wala and campus. But it must have been more than a year since we went out for dinner and drinks and stuff. And so, the time spent last night meant a lot to me. We caught  The Day After Tomorrow  at Plaza Singapura before heading for drinks at  urlLink Sound Bar @ theliquidroom  where we used to hang out. Having felt a wee bit disappointed that my results were not fantastic, having Rai by my side truly made a difference. We two, 2nd uppers in a class of our own. :) But as I told  urlLink Eileen  (who too was a wee bit disappointed), "We have big hearts and big brains that are inadequately reflected in our academic results", for we all now know that academic achievement is not a true measurement of one's intellect but of how one attains those grades. I didn't do too badly, actually. Majority As and a couple of Bs in all. I must have missed the first by a bit... but I'd live with it. :)  BUT, to me, the only person who truly deserves the 1st class is my darling  urlLink Melly ... Although I was trying to deal with my new status as a second class citizen, I was truly and honestly happy for her that I teared. Mel means soooooo soooooo much to me and I was praying that she would do as well or better than me. Never have I known such an angel who gives so much to others and so little to herself. Never have I known such a good friend who stays by my side through thick and thin and still loves me for who I am, with all my idiosyncrasies. She has played a significant role in nudging me to where I am today and I just can't stop thanking God for blessing me with such a great friend. sMELly, me love you too! :)  ... my sweetest chocolate candy and i ...  urlLink

      I'm still a little tired from all the excitement last night.  Met up with Deirdre for dinner at  urlLink Holland V . We had North Indian at Kinara, which was good and less expensive than I thought it could be. I still prefer Maharajah, though. Mostly because they have my favourite  Prawn Butter Masala . :) Yummy!  Deirdre bought me a pretty pink  urlLink SPCA  tee with little cats on it. She's such an angel... We talked for hours, as usual. It was sad to say goodbye, because I know that with our busy schedules, we don't get to dine much. I'm really looking forward to our next date.  Met G briefly thereafter. Haven't seen him for weeks. We've drifted, I must say. But at least we're in touch, and I hope to see him again just before I fly off.  And now, I'm still a little too sleepy to drag myself to the conference in ulu NTU. But I'm sure it'd be a good day today. :) It's sometimes good to be optimistic.

      A toast to my very first entry! :)  I've toyed with the idea of having my very own blog for a long time (though not as long as having my own website! I still haven't got one). Although I enjoy reading others' entries, the thought of having one of my own required much rethinking. Perhaps itz the fear of commitment I have deep inside me - having to start something I might not have the energy to keep up with. Then I'd have the same answer to the questions - "How many entries have you put up? Have you been faithfully updating?" - as I would to "How many boyfriends have you had?". My usual response -  I don't know . (Avoidance of 2nd follow-up question is intentional :P).  But for now, who cares?  Exciting morning with a cake to celebrate Dad's 64th birthday. My father is 40 years older, and 40 times wiser, more adorable, more lovable, more understanding, ... than me. He's  THE  man of my life and nobody can take his place. Nobody. Period.

      Keita gave me a pretty anniversary present yesterday - an  ixus i 4.0 mega pixels . I love it! I've been thinking about a handy digital camera for some time. In pretty black, it fits just nicely into a velvet black pouch the size of a mobile phone. I brought it to  CH Family Day  today and took some really nice photos with my boys. Unfortunately, the dodo me erased all the photos while playing around with the camera. *Ouch* We all learn.   ...ixus in pretty black...   urlLink   &nbsp;   As I look at the trusty EOS 300 I've had for years, tears&nbsp;began to flow. This camera carries with it memories difficult to forget - memories that teach me lessons of love and relationships. I've heard, and now believe, that it is difficult to forget one's first love. Although many come in and out of my life, few remain precious in my shelf of memories. For better or worse, I wished it did not have to end that way.   ...eos with pretty memories...   urlLink   &nbsp;   *in an attempt not to leave my EOS unused, I bought four rolls of film*    I'm so afraid that Keita and I would have to end the same way. Mum and Dad received another proposal for my hand today. We had a good talk together with Keita, and I fear the direction we are heading. My parents are handling it with a more opened mind, though. I&nbsp;believe after seeing how things took turn after CS and I broke up, they are conscious about forcing their opinions on me. Oh well... do pray for me and with me.

      F: You&nbsp;brought lots of tissue or not?  Me: For you ah?!  *Ouch* Spoke to soon.  Brotherhood  was indeed a good movie, and one that reminds me the depth of familial love is often taken for granted.   Watching a movie in an afternoon was a luxury I have not had since term began. But today was such a draining&nbsp;day - the boys drained my blood out of me, that is. I decided to dump everything to meet Fadzli and forget the&nbsp;stresses of work.   Went over to&nbsp;G's thereafter. He pulled his ligament rather badly and would be on medical leave for a month. Poor boy... it hurts just to see him limp his every step. But he's now out playing pool with Amir. I suppose being on leave has its perks!

      My Gifted Ed HQ officer must have had difficulty sleeping after the observation on Thursday that she came to speak to me on Friday. I was rather frightened when she sat&nbsp;beside me&nbsp;and held my hand, telling me that it was the lesson that did not go well and not because I was a lousy teacher. I mean, this is THE lady-from-HQ-to-be-frightened-of we're talking about! ;)  &nbsp;  Oh well... it seems that after all the laments (which I heard she apparently does to most&nbsp;teachers no matter how experienced they are), I've been told today that I'd be in the programme for some time. My vice-principal and HOD spoke up for me, expressing the injustice of expecting a mind-blowing, brilliant lesson from a fresh grad. At the same time, I don't think I'd ever meet&nbsp;the officer's&nbsp;expectations no matter how long I stay in the programme. Whatever it is, I doubt I'd be staying any longer than end next year. By then, I hope to leave for my Masters or back to teaching in the mainstream programme (and then for my Masters) before the wedding bells ring and all that jazz.  &nbsp;  Mastering dealings with the media is another thing I have not been able to achieve. Today, I had to deal with a journalist who had very stereotypical definitions of success&nbsp;when he&nbsp;questioned why I chose teaching. I hate it when journalists have a set angle they would like to&nbsp;pursue and try to find ways in which I fit into the picture rather than attempting to portray me as a subject on my own. In doing so, they often quote me out of context and manipulate my words to fit their storyline. Tough. Thank God for my sister and her connections with the media that often protect me from being "at the mercy of these people" (quoting her). Today, I have learnt to reject publicity when I am uncomfortable with it.  &nbsp; NTU Corporate Affairs called to persuade and commented that I've been seen as "the next big thing". RUBBISH. Just leave me alone.&nbsp;I echo Mustaffa's sentiments that the closest to expectations of us being MPs is when we become  Mama Pratas . :)

      Saturday was indeed a memorable day for me. To me, it was an experience that I&nbsp;need only once in my lifetime (which thus excuses me from the upcoming Teachers' Investiture!). Above all, I saw Saturday as a celebration for my parents than for myself. Dad especially, was enjoying himself, catching up with old friends and feeling proud that I am his little girl. It is hard not to feel pampered when I play lil' girl to a couple of "fathers" who both mean a lot to me in various ways.  &nbsp;  ...sisters, mummy, daddy, prof leo tan, mr sim cheng tee...   urlLink      Family aside, life would have been tough without my little chocolates - my bundles of joy, my huggable bolsters, my suppliers of tissue paper when&nbsp;I weep&nbsp;- my dearest friends.  &nbsp;  ...sam ah-hock, kumz, smelly melly, nat-a-lee...   urlLink   &nbsp;   To top my chocolates,&nbsp;there is&nbsp;of course&nbsp;my best friend of many years -&nbsp;Natalie, who was so sweet as to come for my boring convo. Not forgetting my 24-hour-emotional-support Meijun who often reminds me to take things easy. Raphael keeps me going with&nbsp;memories of the fun we shared&nbsp;in hall and in the union. Anthony urges me to treasure life and all that I'm blessed with (in more ways than one! hahahahahaha&nbsp;:P).  &nbsp;  ...nat, raphael, meijun, anthony...   urlLink   &nbsp;   And to end that eventful day, here's sharing our&nbsp;toast (of mortar boards) to a great future ahead&nbsp;of us all.   urlLink      P/S: There were many I wished I had taken photographs with. Amidst the running around, I had missed Rai, Jon, Jingles, Anitha, Nazrul, Zan, Gery, Vil, Dr Vanitha, Dr Dahl, Dr Low, Prof Goh, ... Hmmmmph.

       What a good day! :)   &nbsp;    urlLink       My speech for the convocation ceremony. Other photos later! :) &nbsp;  I looked awfully exhausted and the large screen that magnified every flaw of my face did not help. But heck! At least I didn't cry or fall on stage -&nbsp;both of which had happened in my life and had thus perpetuated a phobia within me.    urlLink     &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Mr Pro-Chancellor, distinguished guests, fellow graduates, ladies and gentlemen. A very good morning to you. I’m Rita Zamzamah Nazeer from the English Language and Literature Academic Group at National Institute of Education.  &nbsp;  It is indeed my honour, to stand before you today, to mark this special occasion for us:  for our parents who have nurtured us with love and devotion, for our teachers who have taught us lessons in life beyond the scope of our textbooks, and for all of us graduands who have spent many years of our lives studying for this degree - the culmination of our educational experience.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Five years ago, when I joined NIE as I embarked on my training as a teacher-to-be, I felt very green and insecure about how my future would be. Today, even as we have been presented with our graduation scrolls, I still feel very green – but perhaps just a different shade of green. Our education here in NIE, has made a difference to my greenness, as it is not all about the paper qualification. It is not all about attaining straight As or all about the class of honours awarded to us. Teacher-education, as I have experienced it, is about character development, about the ability to adapt both academically and socially. Having been actively involved in student organizations like the Trainee Teachers’ Club and community work namely the SPCA and the Nature Society during my undergraduate years, I have learnt that there is more to life than just academic excellence. NIE has taught me intellectual humility, and the fact that precisely because I have acquired more knowledge, I am aware that there is a lot more that I have yet to know.  &nbsp;  As graduate teachers, our mission is to educate the young to face the challenges of life. In the words of philosopher William Ellery Channing, “It is a greater work to educate a child, in the true and larger sense of the word, than to rule a state”. Helping a child to achieve pure academic excellence may not be as tough as trying to holistically educate the child.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In many ways, as teachers ourselves, we feel a sense of affiliation with our lecturers at NIE, as we share the same passion for the profession. We, as teachers, should never underestimate the simple value of teaching with the heart and from the heart. To me, this is crucial as we strive towards maintaining our initial passion for teaching regardless of the duration we plan to be in this profession. We should not lose sight of the intangible rewards that this profession has to offer. I am sure, many would agree with me, that the teachers we fondly remember from our past, are those who have demonstrated their love and concern for us in different ways and in varying degrees. At the same time, it will be a continual challenge for us to keep the flame burning in the hearts of teachers. As graduands of NIE, I urge you to join me in this challenge. Parker J. Palmer may enthuse us with his words:  “Academics often suffer the pain of dismemberment. On the surface, this is the pain of people who thought they were joining a community of scholars but find themselves in distant, competitive, and uncaring relationships with colleagues and students. Deeper down, this pain is more spiritual than sociological: it comes from being disconnected from our own truth, from the passions that took us into teaching, from the heart that is the source of all good work. If we have lost the heart to teach, how can we take heart again? How can we re-member who we are, for our own sake and the sake of those we serve?”  &nbsp;  Teaching is my choice, and I foresee it being an exciting experience for me. Among my high-flying peers, I have chosen the road less travelled. Yet, this road has a place for me, and I am glad to be on it. I am certain that this road will lead me towards a fulfilling career I will never regret.  &nbsp;  Indeed, whilst this ceremony marks our success in taking a step up the academic ladder, we should bear in mind that this success is not ours alone but one that has to be shared with others. With that, my fellow graduands, could you please rise and join me in giving our parents and lecturers a round of applause for their love and dedication that has been instrumental in developing us into who we are today. To Mummy and Daddy, to you, I extend my heartfelt appreciation. I could not have come this far without you.  &nbsp;  Thank you, and please be seated.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To end, I would like to share with you, the words of Professor Leo F. Buscaglia,  “Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around”.  &nbsp;  On that note, I wish you a fulfilling career ahead as I look forward to facing the challenges together with you, as educators, towards building a better age.  &nbsp;  Thank you.

      Just got back from Walas. I had to leave Melly, Nat, Ning, Rach, Sam and Mel early cos I was so exhausted and would like some rest before tomorrow. It was good to have met my darlings after some weeks of not seeing one another. Also met Eileen and hubby, as well as, Sanjay. I was so reluctant to leave, especially since Rai was singing my favourite songs&nbsp;but I just gave up physically.  &nbsp;  Highlight of the evening has to be seeing YK again. YK - the one who swept me away with his charms on my birthday some months back. Hahahahahahah... I remember that faithful night very well.&nbsp;For once, I wished G would stop bugging me to meet him (and thus leave YK). Where G is concerned, everyone knows that few people can overtake him. :)  &nbsp;  Damn. I just realised that&nbsp;YK would&nbsp;be there on Sam and Mel's wedding when I make a fool of myself in Mandarin! *Argh*  &nbsp;  But just as I wished I was single again, I was greeted with 55 stalks of roses upon reaching home.      urlLink    &nbsp;&nbsp;  My sweetest Keita has sent me a bouquet for my convocation tomorrow.   It is hard to love someone else but him, ain't I right?

      Classroom observation was terrible. One of the MOE HQ officers was particularly upset about the condition of the classroom (which I had no control of). No doubt, the classroom in this holding school is very small and has little ventilation. It didn't help that the aircon was down.   Oh well... I don't blame her for thinking that I didn't perform well. I couldn't agree more. I was in no mood for showtime and I just wanted to get it done and over with. Mainstream or Gifted Education Programme makes little difference to my desire to teach.   I was rather upset by my poor performance at first, but somehow I got over that rather quickly. Within an hour, I was more relieved than upset. Perhaps I'm already immuned to failure these days.   Failure to get 1st Class Honours is what I have to face on Saturday. I hate it when my lecturers come up to me and say, "How do you feel about your results? Are you alright?". With all good intentions, such remarks just make me feel smaller and remind me that I could have done better should I had put in more effort and not be lulled by the mentality that intelligence is all that matters. Having to deliver the valedictorian speech at convocation this Saturday, I hope no one offers any sympathy comments on getting 2nd and not 1st. Unless they want me to CRY while giving my speech, they should just stay away from this PMS-ing child for a while. Just glad that Dad, Mum, 2nd Sis, Younger Sis and Nat (Koh) would be there for me. How wonderful it is to be loved! :)    I just wished Keita and Fadzli could come.

      Today is possibly my lowest day as a full-fledged teacher, having joined the teaching fraternity for just three weeks.   M: Why don't you just quit teaching? We have our preferences, you know...   Despite knowing that M is a child going through counselling for his angst against the world, his remarks not just hurt but pierced through my tired heart. It has been such a long week for me, and really, I don't need such a comment from a ten-year old who has been part of the group that drains my heart and soul.  Already having to grapple with so much uncertainty, M's remarks just shattered me as I broke into tears as soon as I stepped out of class. Spent some time in the washroom sobbing like a baby. I tried so hard to hide my broken heart but I teared again as soon as I stepped into the staffroom (and again and again and again).  Although M broke half my heart, today has made me realised that there are so many people who often glue the pieces of my heart back together. My closest colleagues came to hug me, knowing how much I have put in trying to educate my children. I wished it wasn't blown up as it was. At the same time, I've learnt that this is all part of my learning journey - an experience which would make me stronger and more able to react to such children's insecurities that surface in varying manifestations.  M did apologise, saying that he didn't mean what he said. He probably thought it was funny... (not realising that their jokes are hardly ever amusing when they try too hard) but poor M caught me at a wrong time; at a time when I am  feeling so low, vulnerable and worthless.   Tomorrow's my MAJOR lesson observation. I hope I can pick myself up in time. My darling buddy, Luke, has been by my side these days, helping me tide over this rough period and even helping me with the materials for my lessons. I find it cute, that our roles in this 7-year friendship has reversed. Luke, you have taken over my role as the positive one in our relationship! Damn! *hee*  Thanks, Lukey (Milky Cookie? *bleah*). Thanks so much. It could only get worse without you. *hugs*

      Palmy slipped off my hand and fell face-down on Monday.  My heart went down with it. Cracked.  ...trusty old palmy...  urlLink     ...funky new palmy...  urlLink      *Sigh*  Each time I think of replacing something old, trusty and dear with a new one, I would lose or break the old. Happened TWICE to my mobile phones and frighteningly, to the people around me. I hope it doesn't happen to my Canon SLR camera when it has a new companion. That camera from Choon Seng some years back, is indeed oh so dear to me. Just as the memories it has captured within it.  *Sigh*

      Children are such innocent angels. They never fail to entertain us with their gift of innocent wit. With little regard to the world beyond their own, I envy the life of a kid... so innocent, so carefree.  Akmal, Arsyad and Asyraf (my nephews) came back from KL last night and we spent some time shopping at book and toy stores. Spiderman craze - imagine what I have to go through at every juncture with a trace of Spiderman.  With my tight schedule, I don't usually get to spend much time with them and so we stretch every minute we spend together. It feels nice to have them around my bed in the mornings when I wake up and in the evenings before I go to bed. I envy their energy capacity.  Such a pity Nad and Luq couldn't join us this weekend. It's riot when the Power of Five comes together. :)  ... little nadhrah amongst the boys (akmal, arsyad, asyraf and luqman)...  urlLink     Exhausted-auntie-me gave Sungei Buloh a miss this morning. After struggling with my Tae Kwon Do moves (or lack of it) for an hour, Baby Sis and I left for TKD at noon. And now with tons of work undone -  a solid lesson plan for Thursday's big day, lesson plans for the rest of the week, two stacks of marking, vetting for tomorrow's HQ meeting and stacks of academic readings to cover my ass when bombarded with questions during HQ discussions.   Best of luck to me.

      OKAY. This indulgence thing has gone a little too far. I really really intended to get one pair of comfortable shoes for work. Honest! But I left with two pairs of shoes, a bottle of perfume and a bag. Oh dear. I shall stay away from retail therapy for the next few weeks. Right.  Fadzli and I bumped into Elaine and her neighbour, John, at Causeway Point today. It was really nice to be with familiar faces after a week of hard work. I wished F and I could have spent more time, but I think he was exhausted and we didn't get to talk much. I don't know when I'd see him again. Think he's got a new distraction and so I foresee being shelved for the next few months. Nothing unusual. ;) I just need to get used to it again (and find a new breakfast-lunch-dinner-shopping-movie kaki).  Met G to distract my hyperly rationalising mind. Not that the-one-who-sparked-my-distrust-in-having-honest-relationships could cure me from compulsive over-rationalising, but he certainly could remind me (as a living example) that some relationships need lighter emotional investment.    Let GO. Hear me?

      I just dreamt of Chiu Hsia and Fadzlis (both my 'bro' and buddy). Somehow, we were hanging out. Of course, it's strange because in truth, both the Fadzlis can't get along. Hee.  I'm missing my friends!!! BADLY!!!  I haven't seen Melly and Fadzli for more than a week. I haven't seen Nat, Sam, Mel and Rai for almost two weeks. I haven't seen Natalie, Chiu Hsia, Elaine and Cher since BANGKOK! I haven't seen Meijun, Nizar, Luke, Deirdre, Jingles, Suzie and Sotong for more than a month. I haven't seen Bro. Fadzli, Poach, Vil, Lea, Beng Chiak, Jacqueline and Isaac for months. And Shawn and I have been postponing our lil' dinner.  The last friend-of-years I've seen is G. And that was a week ago!  I miss you all. SIGH.

       Today was a day of UPS and DOWNS.   Tummy didn't feel good from the time I got up this morning, and so I spent the entire morning dragging myself in and out of class. I didn't have much appetite for food and this just made me feel weaker cos of my anaemia. At the same time, I've realised that I've attained the ability play the 'role' of 'Ritz the teacher' as soon as I step into class. Indeed, the world's a stage.  Then came the UP. I decided to leave school, not for home but for town. Keita has suggested that I take some time off for myself since it is probably the stress that has been getting into me. And so, SHOPPING it was! :) Spent my afternoon at Borders and left with a huge bill of almost $200. OUCH! Also dropped by Marks and Spencer for some yummy chocolates and biscuits. YUM!  Then back to the DOWN, with a discussion on DEMANDS with baby sis. Poor sis had to listen to me. I got so angry with the world, I decided to calm myself with some online shopping at Victoria's Secret.  THERE! I hope Keita doesn't faint when the bill comes. But I'm UP again! Indulge me for today. ;)

      In a week, I have to teach a class with FIVE observers. My mentor, HOD, Vice-Principal and two Gifted Ed HQ Officers. I teach in a small classroom with a small class of 13 boys. I think even the lizards in the class would get stressed by the added pairs of eyes in that crucial hour.  I have been having mixed feelings about joining the Gifted Ed Programme. I've always felt that my heart has been with the underachievers (it still is) and not only do I disagree with segregation of the highly intelligent, I too have not been able to place myself as part of the programme. Thus, the past few months have been an emotional and mental struggle for me, as I deliberate my stand within myself.  Each time I go back to HQ, my self-confidence gets crippled. I don't know if I can stretch the abilities of these students. I don't know if I can meet the expectations of a GE teacher. I don't know if I have to change so much of me, I would still be ME at the end of the day.  At the same time, having been with my boys the past weeks, I've realised that they are just as lovable as "mainstream" children. They are still very much the "little people" (quoting Meijun) who have attracted me to teaching five years ago. They are as human as any of us are and perhaps the only thing that I have to change, is my teaching style - which has to change with any group of students I teach anyway. Not my beliefs, not my principles, not all of ME. Thus, being in the programme allows me the opportunity to pursue my aspirations for my little people, without losing myself.  DON'T TELL ME I HAVE SUNK INTO THE SYSTEM. Having understood it from a differing perspective does not always dismiss one as a fish in the sea. I could be one of the animals who can live both on land and in water, and then aspire to fly. ;)

      And to dearest Sam's question, "Rita, would you be the  hostess  for our wedding?", I have said "YES!".   Sam and Mel's wedding is at risk, of course. With me as their emcee (hostess=emcee for Sam) would already be a bad thought. With me as their emcee IN MANDARIN sounds vulgar!  But I shall, because no matter how I suck, I know that Sam and Mel would want their wedding to be special and so I shall work on making my sucky Mandarin special in its own way. I hope I don't mispronounce any words that'd make the guests choke on their food in laughter.  Listening to U2's  Elevation  and I wished I was at Wala Wala. With a meeting at HQ early tomorrow morning, a trip to National Stadium with the boys in the afternoon and Tae Kwon Do at night, I've told Rai that my already diminishing energy level won't be able to sustain the night.   Damn.  Elevate ME!

      I hate it when favours turn into demands.  Over the years, (as Shawn always suggests) I've been trying to learn how to say "no" to requests beyond my capacity but somehow, I've not been able to cope with the reaction to such rejection.  Sometimes, I wished others would remember that I have needs as they do.  Sometimes, I wished others would remember that I am tied by constraints as they are.  Sometimes, I wished others would not take my willingness to give for granted.  Now is that some time. I wished.

      Here I am again, just slightly more than a month since I last was, at the 15-minute Internet station at the airport.  Although I'm glad to take off for a good break, I'm not sure if I'm as glad to leave what I'm leaving behind - my parents, my friends and my country (and my tons of undone work). I could have chosen another day to leave, but I'd be away on my nation's birthday. Hmmmph....  I'm a true blue SINGAPOREAN.

      Sniff Sniffs are finally clearing up. After struggling for a week, I can actually breathe without any irritation! :)  With the blocks cleared, I decided to spend the weekend catching up on some things I meant to do over the week: 1) Went for a facial after the Tan Kah Kee seminar yesterday. Saw Nai Rui at the seminar - an old friend from Jalan Hijau, who happens to be one of the Tan Kah Kee postgraduate scholarship awardees. Wow. Phd. Wow. When would I clear that???  2) Cleared up the boxes in the middle of my room. Put in my readings and notes for the past year and tucked these boxes neatly into my wardrobe. But as these boxes went in, some magazines and files had to come out. So I'm really not sure if I've progressed in clearing up the mess in my room. *hee* Keita and I have decided that we'd need a lil' library in our house to store my books. I can't wait!  While clearing up, I chanced upon the box with lil' things that bring memories - memories I've been trying to downplay the past three years. I read the letters, notes and cards. I looked through the photos. I sat and I thought. Of how things might be if we were still together. But I know we might not have lasted this long, and if we did, I would not have grown up / fell ill / met G / be with Keita / .... So I suppose things are meant to be.  I think I need a break badly. I hope there are still some available flights to Tokyo next weekend. Ginza shopping and Disneyland. :) It sounds a little crazy to leave in the middle of term but I'm just training up for my taitai-dom! Wohoa!
