      well, dang, its been a while since i wrote... so yea. im going to write! so, this weekend was RenFaire. it was fun. i had a good time. besides the throwing of ice cubes down my shirt and the water, and almost getting thrown in a big metal bin of ice cold water while wearing a white shirt, it was great. i actually had a lot of fun. last weekend was Rainier. that was great fun. i had a really good time. we only took the A and a couple of blankets. oh, and some cheese and summer sausage. it was good. i got to have a nice long chat with justin. my mom didnt go, and my dad left sat night, so i was there all by my onesie. it was pretty great. i had a good time. other than that, i am a mean, messy person supposedly. and now, im just waiting for the day that justin says oh well b***h, i cant stand you anymore, get the h*ll away from me and never talk to me again. i mean, chris screwed with my mind so much, i cant even trust the one person i truly care about now. and justin doesnt even know the half of it. i cant trust him because of chris, and i dont want to tell him because i dont want to know what he is going to say about it. i dont think i would be able to breathe without having justin in my life, but then again, if i am so screwed up that no matter what i try i cant trust the one person i actually care about besides my family... since they are family and all.... but yea.... so i am freaking out. i dont want things to go south, but then again, its almost like inadvertantly i am asking them to. its crazy. i mean, for a few months i was told how i need to lose weight and blah blah blah. and then, im so ugly that he would rather f**k my brother then me. i mean, dang, if you feel that way, whyd you ask me out in the first place you f****r??? i mean, sh*t. thats crap. whatever. and then come to find out, he had another girlfriend the whole time?? WTF is up with that?!? whatever. and they were engaged like less than a week or something like that after we broke up. d*mn thats crap. if they wanna play games, then f**k them. i couldnt even go out of my house without fear that i was gonna die. what kind of crap is that??? then, thank god, he left, and then EMily had to keep bringing it up! WTF like just to rub it in or something... i dont know. whatever. he can go f**k his GF whenever he wants, as long as i never have to talk to him again. i mean, he followed me around for 2 months if i ever went into town and he saw me. i was deathly afraid for my life. what kind of crap is that?? then he tried to get a job in the mall?? WTH is his problem?? thank god he is gone! i mean, i look at justin, and i beleive what he says, but at the same time... i have some little voice in the back of my head saying "hes a guy, dont trust him. youre just gonna get f***ed over again! dont beleive it!" i mean, i dont thik he would do half the crap if any of what chris did to me, but still. i cant even trust aynone without thinking oh, is he gonna pull the same shit chris did?? dang, ive rambled on forever... but i guess it has to come out sometime. its the end of the process.. and then that bastard thinks he can go to my friends and parae sh*t in front of them and they are going to run to me??? i dont think so jerk. now i think youre stupid. i dont know what i saw in you in the first place.. oh wait, i didnt see anything, i was just looking for a way to get out of my house for the summer! i hated you even when we were going out you a$$hole! so guess what... go f*ck your boyfriend in virginia or wherever it is you are... and stay the h*ll away from me and my friends! i am quite happy where i am so leave me the hell alone! and to my dear friend who never reads this that keeps bringing him up... DO NOT TELL ME ANY MORE SHIT ABOUT HIM! I DONT WANT TO HEAR IT! QUIT OPENING UP OLD SHIT I DONT WANT BROUGHT UP! ITS NOT ANYTHING THAT I EVER WANT TO HEAR AGAIN! HES BAD NEW S FOR ANYONE HE CROSSES... SO LEAVE ME ALONE ABOUT HIM!!! OH GOD I THINK I AM GOING CRAZY!!! SOMEONE SHOOT ME AND GET IT OVER WITH! I dont think anyone needs to go through this shit. not at my hands. what if i just died?? would that solve me problems?? or in my next life.. .would i have the same ones??? probably... who knows. i mean, i cant do anything without thinking, is this some huge game justins playing on me if it has anything to do with him. i dont know. i really hope not... i dont want to get played again. it was bad enough the first time. if i get screwed over this time, i will wind up in a funny farm. litterally... whatever. i think i have ranted enough. there is no reason to poison my already black heart anymore talking about that a$$hole and my problems. whatever. i think i am crazy. how can someone live their life like me??? i mean, i am officially underweight now... and i love it. i think im sexy now. i mean, before, i told people like a typical model that i am 105... but, i was back up to like 115. now, i jumped on a scale this morning... and im down to 106!! i am so happy, even though i know i shouldnt be. justin is going to kill when he reads this. im going to need a million years of therapy for all this sh*t. whatever. i am done. justin, i love you, even if i cant trust you yet... i honestly am trying. if my mom finds out any of this, i will kill everyone i know who has the link to this site. got it??? good.
