      fake, that's all I am. I'm nothing, I'm fake. This world is shit. I can't get a single hug from somebody. I know I am as fake as any STUPID girl, because now, I am really want&nbsp;a boyfriend, and personnally I find myself incredibly superficial and self absorbent. It may just because all my other friends have had boyfriends and currently have one. Maybe I'm jealous. Or is because I hate being the fifth wheel. I just stand there while they are with eachother hand in hand. Or is it because I currently crave how it feels to feel another persons hand against mine, and have&nbsp;certain feeling. I'm alone, and I am fake.   Goddess of Tradegy.

      I hate this... I hate how the world works. I hate Outback Jack, for some reasons it frustrates me. I wonder how the hell he lets go of a nice girl. Noticing that that's how the real world is ... when a nice girl finds the perfect guy, some SUPERFICIAL girl walks in and takes over. She makes lies, and takes away everything.   I had a dream last night, it was so nice. I got a hug. IT SUCKS!! All I really ask for is a hug, and I don't get anything... I haven't even cried for ... ever... I HATE Valin what's his name. Mari-De is a really cool, down to earth girl... Jack is nice... HIS CHOICE SUCKS!! sorry I was just watching Outback Jack... and for hate... I WILL SOOOOOooooo Not watch that!!   I don't understand, in my dreams it goes to farther then a hug or held hands, or even merely the a spirit of that person. I have never kissed, and I have NEVER dreamed of it, but it still doesn't make sense. You see, I have never held hands with a boy, or hug... well a hug that meant something... I haven't had A SINGLE boyfriend... so none of it makes sense. Can Someone help me? What are my dreams trying to say? I am starting to think, because these memories are ALWAYS staying in my head, and I remember the each and every few ones. So, is it showing my desperate feelings, or is it just showing that it is what I TERRIBLY want. Is it what I totally... .... I'm over this topic... no. no I'm not. Is this what you call Hormones? YES! Yes, this&nbsp;must be the hormones, what else could this be. Stupid feelings.   Hormones. My enemy. Why they hell does being a FUCKING teenager have to be SOO hard. I don't know myself, because I do not have that exactly on my mind, and do you know why? Because these "hormones" make me so confused. The first few seconds: boys. THe next SECOND: my life. What do I think about the rest of the time? I DO NOT KNOW! I AM SO CONFUSED ABOUT THESE STUPID HORMONES!!   Do you need some TRUE evidence? Look at the writings above. A girly hate on Outback Jack, hugs, more Outback Jack, then suddenly my writings became intelligent and I talk about dreams, and finnally they evolved to hormones. Now, that is TRUE evidence. Good Night, people. Enjoy my writings.

      Well, my days before this were great. This boy, my turned crush, was looking at me , with the cutest smile that I dream about. His name? Micheal Lampe.   It was the greatest two weeks of MY LIFE! He stared at me, that's all really. He also kept on asking me if I was going to the dance. I felt as if I was... wanted. Well, after the dance that he kept asking me to, my friend Christina went and asked Robert about Micheal. The note that she sent read things like, "why won't he ask her out" or "what's up with micheal and mercedes." He answered back "He's to afraid to to ask her out!" with a heart around, it was weird ... he never would do that, then again... we didn't know eachother very well.   Ok, let's skip the shit with Chris... and end up to the  EXTREME  tradegy... It took puzzling nights trying to find things out. We went up to Robert a few months later about Micheal... he ignored it. So we threatened him about the notes he gave us. He didn't care, he even pushed us to give it to Micheal. So we gave it to Michael... Robert still didn't care. "What?!?" we kept on repeating at our conversation. ---- I am having trouble with this story ... not many descriptions... You see there is even more tradegies that I do not name... and I feel to embarassed to tell... I am scared, and a bit ... overwhelmed STILL from this act of doing from many people. ---- Ok... I'll try again... I think I'm ready.... ok ... as we did this ... I wrote something that I thought was meaning full... and Christina pushed me to show it to him.... and I did... a part of it wrote, "can't you do anything? Humiliate me or Hug me?" and he did what I asked. He humiliated me. He gave this note to another girl... she read it, and she told everyone about it. I cried that day and I won't forget it. After that time it was humiliating... I could hear Victoria Roberts&nbsp;and others telling how ... OBSESSED I was... I didn't even shed a tear... and I kept it in... One day... I JUST BURST!! I don't know if I like him or not... and that's the sad part... I WANT TO PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE... and yet I am still picking a side... Hate or Love.

      As my first post, I shall talk about myself, and my friends. I am a girl at the age of 14, recently just changed an age older. Yes, I was just a 13 year old teeny bopper, interested in rock... but as I grew old my ignorance had changed and my likings have grown a wide and general clearing. During the summer, I don't wait for anything. I am soon to become a simple freshman in ANOTHER uniform wearing private school. Thank goodness it is no longer parted from public schools because of religion, instead great advancement of learning. But enough of my future, let's talk about my Straight down present time.   Let me to you my "group" of friends. Their names a Kelly Ghelfi, and Christina Yoseph. Not very long ago my only friend was Christina but then I got to know Kelly. Well, when I was just friends with Christina she was starting to go out with Nick Shea... who use to be be our old crush... but then I didn't like him anymore. Anyway... Christina wasn't allowed to go out with Nick... so the only time they could "go out" was at school and at parties. Of course all of those times I was there to... I wasn't going to sit there right next to them and watch them cuddle, so I was left alone wondering the areas. You have no idea how it feels. All alone, no one talking to me... I had to walk because if I stayed in one area people would see... but anyway... ... .. So I have NEVER had a boyfriend in MY WHOLE LIFE!! and of course... that was Christina's first. Man... SHE IS SOOOOO lucky... she almost had a boyfriend coming here... in third grade, and probably other times too.&nbsp;... ... ... ... Me? hmm... nothing close. No one has ever liked me, and if they did it wasn't apparent and they never told me.   During this time... I was the third wheel, and nothing more. I was alone. It was INCREDIBLY depressing because if you walk around you are bound to find the sweet couple, my friend ... Christina and Nick, miserabley cunoodling into eachother. And me, alone in a friggin skirt.   Now, when we got to be really good friends with Kelly...&nbsp;all I could think was "I can't wait, because now, I won't be alone" ... unfortunately and coincidentally&nbsp; she had a crush on Nick's friend, Eric. The day I found out, they got together, and I was alone again. Walking around. By myself. Depressing? Definetely. To even make it worse, something that I thought was WONDERFUL, unfolded to find the most destructive thing to happen in my whole life...
