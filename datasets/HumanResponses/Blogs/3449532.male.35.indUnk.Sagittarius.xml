      So, what up kiddies? A rather uneventful week, but let me bore you with the details. Joey and I went to an open mic on Thursday at the Den, a new coffee shop with the right idea-live music, good food, beer and coffee. The owner, Doug, was suitably impressed with our aural offering and hooked us up with a show this upcoming Saturday, July 3rd.  So that should be fun, as they seem to have a good house crowd, and it’s in a good location, in a strip mall with an AMC 20 theatre complex in it. The band playing after us, who looked like they’d be playing Grateful Dead covers (not a necessarily a bad thing) pleasantly surprised me with some old Concrete Blonde- Birthday , from FREE and with the Smithereens- Blood and Roses. Who’da thunk it? Of course, I’m not sure if that’s quite as good as our mandolin driven version of Just Like Heaven, but good nonetheless. Friday night was poker night at the Mitchell household, where I promptly lost my $20. I don’t want to talk about it, but I will, for your sakes. Texas Hold ‘Em, $10 buy in per round, $40 for 1st, 20 for 2nd and your 10 back for 3rd.  4th-7th ,tough shizzle. I was in that group both times, as I’m sure you figured out by doing the math. And if that wasn’t enough, we blew the other keg, so no homebrew . I need to get busy brewing, yo! I still have a hard cider ( and I mean HARD cider, it’s about 12%!) , but it’s Hefeweizen time. Summer’s in full force, and there’s nothing like a delicious, spicy, refreshing Hefe with a slice o’ lemon. Good stuff. I’ll try to get to it this weekend. Saturday, I went out to Joey’s, all the way out in N. Pasco, and we did some jamming and recording, and when I got back we went down to the Sunset Grill to get some wings-chile lime Good, blackened garlic-Bad. Wendy was playing, and she does some pretty good stuff-Leonard Cohen, Lucinda Williams, John Prine, Warren Zevon and the ilk. Sunday was drinking day at the in-laws, with some swimming and stuff, then home for 50 First Dates. Pretty good flick, and Lori didn’t cry all that much until they got married at the end and one of our wedding songs was playing-Somewhere Over the Rainbow, by IZ Khawachatookoolieolierolliepollie, although I’m not sure if I spelled his last name right. (The other song is John Prine and Iris Dement's duet, In Spite Of Ourselves). I have to keep her water glass filled  during any type of romantic comedy/chick flick due to dehydration. Monday night had the open mic at Limeys, which entailed some Guinness, Fullers ESB-one of my favorites, and McEwans export, another of my favorites. Not too many people there, but an appreciative crowd nonetheless. The guy who runs it, Mike, did a set before us and did some Roy Book Binder and one of my favorite tunes by Todd Snyder-"Beerrun". As in “ B double E double R-U-N , beerun … etc. A fun night and our potential new bass player was there, we’ll be playing with him Thursday night in a full band set up. Yeehaw, baby, break out the electric guitar and amp. Funk it homeboy, just don’t stop. Anyway, I gotta get back to work, or at least start looking like I’m doing something. It’s the Man, bringing me down.

      Howdy y'all. Don't be shy with commenting on the blogs, as your observations on my observations are bound to be humorous also-the feedback is welcome and encouraged, and everyone gets to read your comments. And, there is no charge for the service. Well, the solution to the disappearing posting issue has appeared! While talking to John, he mentioned that he had come across the same problem and the solution is simple! Microsoft Word, cut and paste, no more lost postings. Yee freakin’ haw! I thought I had lost both of my second postings, but it turned out I only lost one. Still, this is the way to go. So speaking of John, I talked to Heather and him for a while last night. They somehow stumbled across the coolest job ever. They are getting paid to drive across the country and sell raffle tickets for a very expensive motorcycle, and their expenses are paid. Did I mention they are getting paid to do this? Absolutely amazing. They travel to biker rallies, car shows and the like, camping on the way, eating for free and getting paid to do so. I mean, how cool is that?  It’s good to know that good things DO happen to good people. Well, I had my first  official Fathers Day, as I am officially Mykhaila’s stepfather. I guess that makes me bonafide. It feels kind of weird, being called Daddy and all that, but in a good way. I just can’t always believe it’s real. She is like a ray of sunshine, and I gotta tell ya, she has inherited my sense of humor. You ARE a product of your surroundings. Luckily, she has her momma’s good looks. I somehow got conned into going to church for the first time in…… shit, I can’t even remember. And the good news is, I did not spontaneously combust, as had been previously theorized, nor did I giggle hysterically during the incredibly cheesy music(gimme a casio beat), although I about lost it as Khaila covered her ears and made the face of death during an incredibly painful song. Ahhhh, the luxury of honesty.  But all was not for naught, as I was rewarded for my good deed by getting some incredible barbeque at LeeRoy Selmon’s. Grilled smoked chicken wings, pulled pork, ribs(pork , of course), and some chicken, and a side of collards. Oh, yeah, I still get a side of oral with my pulled pork, but I’ll save that for later. "Can I get a box, please?"

      I safely drove home-or is it safer-ly? Not quite safe, but safer than previously attempted. As you can guess, this is a continuation from the last posting. I'll keep it short, as I just attempted a long ass followup, went to post it, then some sort of java errors! Ack. Being that I am very spontaneous, I bet I lost a bunch of good material that I'll never be able to recall, due to excessive hallucinatory agents prevalent in my youth, along with general retardation. Alright, Saturday had Dave Attel along with his hysterical opening act whose name I can't recall, see explanation above. Before and after the Improv, we stopped the the great Tampa Bay Brewing Co., and started the evening right with a sampler platter 12-4oz brew samples with the cask conditioned porter tied with the oatmeal stout for 1st in both my and Lori's opinion(So many reasons to love that woman..), but I thought the cask conditioned IPA was a very close second. Oh, yeah what about the hefeweizen...Yeah, it was a good idea to get the sampler. Mmmm. After the improv, we played a few games of cricket, drank more good beer and then headed back after my victories. Yes, she drove.

      Aaah, another slow day at work. It's after 2, I've got a full belly (Lobster cake w/red pepper cream sauce, some mediocre slaw, and a couple of amazing slices of tomato. mmmmm.), and am bored shitless. At least I'm getting paid to post this. All is not lost. My dear friend John, who has a blog at  urlLink blackoyster.blogspot.com , indirectly inspired me to do this through his postings. Is it voyeurism or just a geniune curiosity? I'm not sure, as I don't spend endless hours doing this kind of thang, but I find myself continually stopping by his site to see what he has posted recently, only to be disappointed the majority of the time, as the same ol' posts come up. Ah, but when the new stuff is there, rejoice! There is always some witty observation, and I can only hope to aspire to that. At some point, I'll even post some pix or something. I figured I should just get something posted, so here is my less than noteworthy beginning-(begin drumroll) I had good weekend, my band, or it's acoustic alter ego, played at the always fun Dunedin Brewery, in beautiful Dunedin, FL. It's true, we get to play IN the brewery, surrounded by malt, hops, and fermenting tanks. NIRVANA I say! Even better, we're surrounded by appreciative music fans and drink free beers all night. And get paid for it! I'd do it for free beer alone, the cash is a bonus. Although, I have to admit to a tendency to get completely bombed by the end to the evening-I mean, how do you moderate when an endless supply of piper's pale ale is available at your every longing gaze? The answer is you don't. I'm not advocating excessive consumption, just stating the facts. the band's consisted of Joey on acoustic guitar and vocals, me on mandolin, acoustic guitar and various percussion toys, and Paul and Shannon(sp?) on congas and djembe. Paul and Shannon have sat in with us on various open jams, and definetly add a great depth to what Joey and I are doing. We enjoy playing with them. Our full band, Natural Blend, is currently on hold as we look anxiously to the sky, waiting for our bass player to fall from the clouds. It shouldn't be so damn hard to find a good bass player, but I guess everyone would rather play guitar, dammit!  So, in the meanwhile, Joey and I are pursuing this acoustic thing. It's easy(only 2 inputs, rather than 5), fun and the payout splits up much better. So that was fun for Fri night. We actually had some pretty hot greek girls dancing for us who were really into the music(mandolin groupies? unheard of!) and inspired some other peoples to shake their asses, which is pretty uncommon in the brewery, as it caters to a laid back, hippie-ish, beer drinking kind of crowd. The energy level was up and the crowd was appreciative and I was drunk and affectionate. I occasionally get kissy and huggy with my friends: male, female, real or imagined. Now, I don't start trying to slip tongue or anything, I'm just a really happy drunk. This can, however, irritate one's significant other, especially if she (think of estrogen and its emotional side effects, coupled with any type of hormonal imbalance, and throw in some Leonard Croon Mean Ol' Stout) is tired, cranky has issues in general, then drinks a few pints. Yeah, we had a heated "discussion" after the show, which should have effectively killed my buzz, but no such luck. I determined that the safest course of action was inaction, and pulled into the Dunedin Library parking lot for a short nap, and promptly awoke at 4:50 with an extremely dry mouth and sore neck.

      Wow, it’s the end of July already. Unbelievable. Time slips away faster as you increase the amount behind you. My theory is this: At the age of 14, a year&nbsp; lasts forever, due to the fact that it has taken 1/14th of your life to get through that year. But, at&nbsp; the age of 30 (yeah, yeah don’t say it), well… you do the math. Anyway, you get the picture. So July has been busy. I ‘m trying to prepare myself for the Hippyhill Hoodang- what you haven’t heard about the hoodang? Check out the website, yo- hippyhillhoodang.com . My good friend Mike P (aka ponytail mike) and his Indiana Posse are throwing a real bonafide hoodang in beautiful (that’s what they tell me, I’ve never been there) Bean Blossom, Indiana, at the Bill Monroe Memorial Music park. 4 nights of music, camping,&nbsp; natural botanicals (herbs and fungi ) . A bunch of us are playing, representing Southside yo, along with some Indiana bands, and some real bands too. Leftover Salmon, Karl Denson, Jazz Mandolin Project, Rev Jeff Mosier, the list goes on. Check out the website. I am honored to be playing the festival, and amazed that I ended up on the list. I mean, not only am I playing with my buds in their various bands (unfortunately, my band isn’t playing), but I get a chance to sit in with the Rev Jeff Mosier for a few songs. Holy Shit! I am slightly freaking about, but hopefully I won’t shit myself or say anything extremely stupid. One can only hope. I’m really stoked to see all the music and I’m backstage baby! Yeehaw! And although unfortunately, Lori cannot make it, all my sisters are coming. That’s totally amazing. All 4. And some others in the Detroit posse, Mark, his brother Louie-who plays a pretty mean harp-and I’m not sure who else. That’s pretty freaking cool. So, yeah, I’m honing my chops and getting ready for my opportunity. Besides that, life has been moderately busy. We’re moving soon , as we found a really cool house that has the size we need, so we’ve got our house up for sale, and doing all kinds of financial finagling to make the project work. The cool thing is I met the realtor jamming at an open mic at the Dunedin brewery, and we happened to hit it off musically and personally, so he’s hooking me up with a sweet deal to sell my place. Things work out occasionally. His name is Richard and he is a wine merchant also. Talk about a hookup! He and wife, Bianca,&nbsp; came over and we drank some stout- we actually had kind of stout tasting, since I had about 6 different stouts in the fridge of love. (See picture below). So, Youngs Double Chocolate stout and Oatmeal stout rated quite high, with the Double Chocolate being the clear leader. Also Dogfish Chicory Stout was quite good/interesting. It was also brewed with Mexican coffee. Beamish is always quite good, and of course the gold standard, Guinness. There were more beers involved , but things started to get hazy. But a good time for certain, and there was good sushi involved. I haven’t had sushi since February, so I indulged. It was pretty amazing. Rainbow roll, spicy tuna….. mmmmm. Anyway,&nbsp; Lori and I&nbsp; have been busy cleaning and reorganizing, and had my buds Dave and Josh paint the house, as this is what they do. It looks good. How ironic that we wait until we sell the house to paint it and fix all the stuff that should’ve been done when we moved into the place 2 years ago. At least it’s finally getting done. My buddy Trent (who also happens to be my boss) came over and helped (or hindered?) me with the new pool liner. What an absolutely comical sight that probably was. After the 1st 12 pack, we realized it was not lined up, and was inside out, so we had to redo the whole thing. After the 2nd 12 pack we finished. And we were finished! But it’s up and working, just in time for us to move out. Richard hosted an open house Saturday and Sunday, and we have some interest, but no offers yet. Lori and I happened to be Mykhaila-less, as she has been up at her fathers for a week, she’ll be back today. They’re flying her back as they can’t be bothered to drive her back as was the original plan. This is Khaila’s first flight so hopefully she’s ok with it. She does have a chaperone, so that’ll help. Hopefully. But it was a respite for us, and we’ve had a great week (read: lots of noisy sex). Saturday we went to see Patty, who is everyone’s hairstylist and Scott’s wife, for Lori’s cut and foil. Don’t get me started. But then we went to Eddies for beer, darts, airhockey&nbsp; and skeeball. I did lose a game of skeeball. Barely. Then we went to the best BBQ place in Florida, Eli’s a hole in the wall right on the Pinellas trail, with an outdoor smoking shed. All oak, we had chicken, ribs (oh yeah baby) and the most amazing pulled pork ever. We sat on the picnic table in a buzzed bliss, swatting the flies who tried to sneak a bite. Amazing stuff. We then went home for while before heading out to see the human condition, a band fronted by the talented Dean Johanessen on guitar and vocals, with the aforementioned Scott on guitar. They were quite good , the sound mix was incredibly good, and we hung out and drank with Dean, his wife Penny and Pat, Scott and Erik from the band. Dave Wall was in the house, which of course means we had to do SoCo shots, but that’s not a bad thing. Sunday Lori and I went canoeing on the beautiful Weeki Wachee river, where we saw a river otter swimming right next to us , as we were swimming in the water, great stuff. We also saw a couple of manatees, as we usually do on the river. A great day on the river, to be sure. We then stopped at a Belgian Microbrewery. In Spring Hill. Yeah, I said it. Spring Hill. You &nbsp;better believe we asked them why. I mean, they have breweries in Europe and Japan. All the equipment imported from Belgium. And their first Microbrewery in the States is located in…Spring Hill? But the beers were very good, the food was good and the place was beautiful. They had a woefully uneducated staff. The bartender/server should know what their signature soup is made of, not state “ I don’t know, I don’t make it” and the lady giving the brewery tour should not make statements like “as you know yeast is a bacteria…” Simple training people! It’s your job to know this stuff!! But the beer was great and amazingly cheap at happy hour(s) and the bartender gave me several for free. All is forgiven.

      It’s been a while, yo’s, so here it goes- Since our last episode, Joey and I played the Den on the 3rd . The owner, Doug, had a surprise opening act for us, which was a bit irritating, since he had already given us the whole night. Even better, we had to have her open, play a set, let her do a set (which I got “volunteered” to be her accompaniest) and the close the night, and reduce our nights take to a measly $75, but free beer makes the deal palatable. The crowd was slim-holiday weekend and all-but an enthusiastic crowd nonetheless. Lori got a chance to hang out and bring Mykhaila, since it was a coffeeshop, and some others friends I haven’t seen in a while made it out. Of course, I don’t really get to hang out, but it’s nice to have to at least see some friends in the audience. Our opening act was pretty good, she improv’s songs about the customers and things people say to her. Clever and inventive, yes, but lends itself to cheesy rhymes, but overall she was pretty good. I can’t remember her name, so… Anyway, the 4th was fun, we headed to ponytail Mike’s , had some good grub and beers, I brought over some pretty damn good pulled pork, if I do say so myself. Mike had the ubiquitous cheeseball-cornbeef version (no blue cheese-;( ) and some good sausages, along with the regular patriotic fare, cheeseburgers and dogs of course. Some pretty damn good food to be had. We hung out around the pool and watched chitlins splash, then we had to beeline to Apollo Beach to hook up with Lori’s brother and sister. Kegger for Scott’s going away party. Just us, a bunch of young drunk idiots, some cool ass Mexican dudes who barely spoke Englais, and the kegs. Oh yeah, every fucking mosquito and gnat in a 30 mile radius was called in on a recon mission to suck the very lifeblood out of us. After 1.5 minutes, Lori was headed to the beach for fireworks with her sister. But who was to guard the kegs? Why me and my bro in law, of course. And the Mexican dudes. So we drank heavily, swatted at the unrelenting insect assault until we could take it no more. Then into Mikes house of utter chaos. There was a half stack , peavey solid state no less, with some guy playing metallica, badly. A shattered glass chess set on the ground. But never fear, the menudo was here, as the Mexican brothers-Fernando and ?- had cooked up a big authentic Mexican stew. No messing around either, there was literally about 5 gallons of the stuff, with real fatback, chorizo and beans. Mmmmm. So that was our 4th, although I failed to mention the drunken idiots shooting bottle rockets at each other. It’s only funny until someone gets hurt…and then it’s just hilarious. So then on the 5th, we hung out at Fort DeSoto with Lori’s sister Sara and her girlfriend Amanda, who decide to take Mykhaila fishing. A 5 year old. With the attention span of a 3 year old. Needless to say that didn’t last long. I played mandolin, went swimming, and grilled up some chile rubbed pork ribs with a side of cheddarwurst. Oh yeah baby. Pork with a side of pork. With a side of pork rinds, a few beers and a bottle of white wine, it was a heart attack waiting to happen But so delicious! At least I don’t smoke cigs. I do believe there was some sort of vegetable involved, but I can’t be certain. Scott then decided to come out that evening to celebrate his last night in Florida. Just for the record, Jagermeister is never a good idea. Ever. Mike(Scott's soon to be former roommate) passed out in Quaker Steak and Lube. Never even finished his wings. Well, he actually made an unsuccessful attempt to stand, fell, and then Scott and I had to drag him to the car. Quite the sight, I’m sure. We drove back to my place for some steel tips and beverages(leaving Mike passed out in the car, much to his girlfriends dismay), until everyone decided it was time. After tearful goodbyes (nothing makes you sad like a healthy buzz), we sent Scott on his way with his entourage. Tuesday morning at work was painful. In the words of my lovely wife-hurtin’ for certain. Thursday had a noshow by the drummer at rehearsal, therefore he is no longer the drummer. Damn, we just found a bass player. It never ends! Friday had Joey and I at the Brewery as part of American Beer Month. Yeehaw. The usual kind of night, we had a blast and Bravo came up and sang harmony on Norweigan Wood. Nice. This bird has flown.
