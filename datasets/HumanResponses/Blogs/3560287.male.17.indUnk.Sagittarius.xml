      Last night one of my friends (Christian) had a party. I got wasted and some time during the night I started arguing with another one of my friends (Adam). I don't remember what started the fight, but neway, me and Adam got into quite the fist fight. Now, Adam is the biggest kid at the party, and was a varsity wrestler freshman year. I got my shit tossed. My mouth and nose was gushing blood everywhere. Today I'm nursing some cuts and a black eye. That wasn't that bad, because when you're drunk and your adrenaline is pumping you don't feel much. what sucked was waking up this morning at 6:30 to go to work on 4 hours of sleap, hung over, and with a smashed up face. Oh well, shit happens.

      My friend, Carl, had a party last night. After a few beer bongs and a game of pool, me and another friend, Cody, desided to try out the hot tub with one of the girls. So we're enjoying the tub and I learn that this girl is a life guard. So I start "drowning" face down in the bottom of the tub and after a drunken second the girl does what any good life guard does when a swimmer is drowning...she reaches down, pulls my boxers down, and sticks a finger in my ass! I don't think I've ever taken such a huge gulp of water! What the fuck would possess her to stick her finger in my hairy ass? At that point I got out of the tub. Cody, she's all yours. Hope you like it rough.

      I have a problem that faces most of America, I spend more than I make. Even though I work two jobs and mow two yards, I never have enough money. Tomorrow is payday, but tonight I'm gunna have to buy some beer and a pack of smokes. How can I make some easy cash fast without having to work for it? If ne1 has any ideas, I'd love them, cause I'm getting really sick of whoring out my sex to fat old men who like to wear makeup and do it w/out lube.

      Ever since summer started I have been on quite the drinking binge. Last night was no different from any other night, I drank way more than I should have, came home too drunk, and passed out in my room with shoes and the lights still on. But alas, I woke about two hours later because I was thirsty. I will tell you, in my seventeen years I have never been more thirsty than those times when I wake up still drunk at about 3 or 4 in the morning. Then I went down stairs and chugged who glasses of water. This alcohol-induced thirst could be considered very much the same as sex. Stumbling out of bed and down stairs to get the water is like the fucking, finally getting the drink is like the orgasm and getting back into bed is like returning to the party after fucking a girl you just met. Getting that drink is actually better than sex I think.

      I was listening to the radio this morning and the big thing that the DJ, Johnny Dare (who is a badass and can be visited at  urlLink Corporateradiosucksass.com ) was talking about how the Missouri River has been taken over by these Chinese Karp. The thing about these karp is that they can get up to 120 pound and 4 feet long and can jump 15 feet in the air, and they jump AT boats and jet skis. According to Johnny, something about the noise and vibration in the water drives them nut and they leap at the engine. This has caused quite a few injuries and is making jet skiing very unsafe, which sucks. But think how much fun it would be to stand on the deck of a boat with a baseball bat or a fucking ninja sword and just knock the shit out of everything that jumps out of the water. It'd be awsome!

      So my parents say I have to get a job this summer, but every place I apply doesn't hire me. So I'm forced to resort to applying at fast food places. The two I chose to apply at first were McDonalds, just because it's right by my house, and Sonic. McDonalds hired me the next day, probably because they were impressed that I spoke real english without any spanish or eubonics slipping in. I must say, I've worked two days now, and it is the worst fucking job ever! There is litterally not one cook who speaks english, no one on drive through ever talks, and the people taking orders inside (which is what I do) are all weird as hell. The guy training me kept trying to talk to me about Star Trek and really old video games. He kept quoting Star Trek lines to me and giving me advice about playing some game I've never heard of. One my second day on the job a girl came in towards the end of my shift, and I must say she was pretty hot. She works the drive through so I didn't talk to her at first, but when I did finally get close to her I realized that she smelled like shit! Not really shit, it wasn't quite that bad, but it was definately not pleasant, and that just kind of ruined her good looks. But just when I was feeling like I had the worst job in the world, my luck turned for the better and Sonic called me to set up an interview. I just got hired and I can already tell that this will be better that McDonalds. And know what's weird? I have to shit again. This is my second post ever, and both times I've had to shit. It's like blogging excites my bowels. It's like the Twilight Zone. Dee dee dee dee...

      I've been sitting here staring at the screen for like ten minutes trying to think of something to write, but it's not happening. That's OK, cause I got to go shit and that's a lot more urgent than this blog.
