      I thought I saw a man brought to life He was warm, he came around like he was dignified He showed me what it was to cry Well you couldn’t be that man I adored You don’t seem to know, don’t seem to care what your heart is for But I don’t know him anymore There’s nothing where he used to lie My conversation has run dry That’s what’s going on, nothing’s fine I’m torn I’m all out of faith, this is how I feel I’m cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed into something real I’m wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn You’re a little late, I’m already torn So I guess the fortune teller’s right Should have seen just what was there and not some holy light To crawl beneath my veins and now I don’t care, I have no luck, I don’t miss it all that much There’s just so many things that I can’t touch, I’m torn I’m all out of faith, this is how I feel I’m cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed into something real I’m wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn You’re a little late, I’m already torn. torn. There’s nothing where he used to lie My inspiration has run dryThat’s what’s going on, nothings right, I’m tornI’m all out of faith, this is how I feel I’m cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed into something real I’m wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn I’m all out of faith, this is how I feel I’m cold and I’m ashamed bound and broken on the floor You’re a little late, I’m already torn

      Notice me, take my hand Why are we strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me Everytime I try to fly, I fall Without my wings, I feel so small I guess I need you, baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you, baby I make believe that you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy And everytime I try to fly, I fall Without my wings, I feel so small I guess I need you, baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you, baby I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song's my sorry At night I pray That soon your face will fade away And everytime I try to fly, I fall Without my wings, I feel so small I guess I need you, baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you, baby
