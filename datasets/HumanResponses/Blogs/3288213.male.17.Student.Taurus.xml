When first thought out, Microsoft thought they would have this baby out by 2004 and now, in 2004, we are pushing it back over 2 years. ok late 2005 is not to bad then early 2006, then late 2006, its getting out of control i thought, but now at early or even late 2007 i mean come on.  I know you want this to be perfect, but who do you have working on this dang thing Slugs? i mean theres gotta be a lot of people working on this thing. y dont they just double the people and get this thing out there... Post Please and give me your feedback.   I want it to be perfect too...but im getting impactiont.  What they should do it Realese a ShortHorn...haha...

           This is not a journel or anthing but i just have to ask this... If you have a frend, no, a bestfriend and they  come over every day and they talk to you and yous are great friends, having fun every day and then they just suddenly stop comming over what would you think. What would be some of the reasons that you think they stoped comming over?? Please leave me some feedback...cause this is like ripping me appart...We were awsome freinds.. No problems...  Except his family thought i was to old for us to be friends...Im 17 he is 13.. so they try to stop him from coming over my house ...but he came over anyway... (not that they should have any problem with this because his dad is 46 and his mom is only 34 so you would think they would have no problem with age) thats the only thing that i can think of..but it never bothered him before???.....

      Finaly, something new to the greatest media player; or at least my personal favorite; Microsoft has released a beta version of the Windows media player 10!! i know it may not seem like alot, but it is truly awsome. i love it. Its sleek new design and all the new fetures, including ability to buy songs from other stores, is really cool.  Not only do you now have a great looking media player, now you can even change the color to cool looking colors. Though you still dont have much of a choice with the mini version the full version is really great!
