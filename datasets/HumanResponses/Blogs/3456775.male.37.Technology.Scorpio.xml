      I bought a nice old wooden cigar box recently. It finally came in. It says "Havana Comrade Club House" on the lid. It was apparently made in Pennsylvania at some point. On the bottom of the box it says, "FACTORY. NO. 1418 1ST. DIS. PA." and further down: "Factory No. 1418 1st District, State of Penna"  There is also a NOTICE: "The Manufacturer of the Cigars herein contained has complied with all the requirements of law. Every person is cautioned not to use either this Box for Cigars again, or the Stamp thereon again, nor to remove the contents of this Box without destroying said Stamp, under the penalties provided by law in such cases."  I think they were originally priced between 8 and 15 cents each.  If any one has any additional info on this box or the maker of its contents, please let me know.

      Got my dad's old military ammo box (you may have seen the ones that come with Belinda cigars), cleaned it out with lots of WD-40. Then dropped my ZipLock in it. Eventually I'll line it with 1/4" Spanish cedar. I'm going to need to do some additional work because of its odd dimensions.   I don't want to store my cigars on edge, so I have this 5-ish" by 11-ish" dimension to work with. I'm thinking of building a wooden tray or two and then stack them (its 8-ish" high. We''l see how it goes.  I bought an old cedar cigar box off of eBay. Still waiting for it to arrive. I am going to clean it up and oil the exterior. We'll see how we a Drymistat can keep it humid. I'm betting it will be a losing battle.  I bought a cheap punch that lacks an easy way of disposing of the plug. I did not do my homework there. Make sure if you go with a punch to get one that will eject the plug of Tobacco. Otherwise, whatever coolness and class you exuded by plugging in the first place is all lost (and then some) as you begin flinging and banging the punch on some hard surface and you try to knock the plug loose. It is not a pretty sight.

      I smoked this one the other night, well humidified. What a nice, mild smoke this was. Rumors of little cigar aftertaste are well-founded. The Coronas Major came in a nice aluminum screw-top tube. While stylish, retaining humidification is not its strong suit. If you buy one from a place with no reliable humidor, stick it in one for 2-3 days.  I had mine in a Zip-Lock back with some Spanish cedar shavings and a Drymistat. Not an attractive layout, but hey, I'm just getting started in this.  For someone new to cigar smoking or who doesn't want to get a buzz, try a hydrated Don Diego. I bought this one at an HEB (central Texas grocery chain) in Georgetown. I have a feeling their "humidor" is keeping things a dripping 45-55% RH. I squeezed the DD right after buying it and the cap began to crack. 4 days in the bag with the Drymistat had it all recharged.  The smoke was still gnarly as all good cigars are but relatively mild. The taste was very subtle until I had about an inch to inch-and-a-half to go. Then the cigar got quite mushy, the draw was getting too hot and I was having a devil of a time keeping it lit. Up to that point it was quite nice. I'd smoke it again, or perhaps something like it in the less-expensive range.

      Ok, so here I go and enter the world of blogging. I expect that all of this will pretty much be for my archival purposes and won't be all that interesting to anyone else. I'm not that vain, yet.  I'm so vain, I probably think this blog is about me...Oh, wait! It is. Silly me.   So I will be diary-ifying all of my thoughts on cigars and coffee. And occasionally other topics as I'm compelled.  Most of my upcoming blogs will be on my more active entry into the world of cigars and their accompanying culture. I have smoked cigars quite irregularly from the mid-90's up to about 6 months ago. By irregularly I mean like averaging 5-8 a year and sometimes going 3+ months between cigars.  A brother-in-law is a carpenter and we started discussing building ourselves personal humidors. We were tired of one-offing under humidified cigars for way too much money. My research into humidor construction and characteristics exposed me to the intriguing cigar culture in general. I'm just getting to know it so most of my blogs will undoubtedly have a newbie flavor. Oh well, we all start somewhere.  I've also been drinking coffee since the mid 90's and have formed all sorts of opinions about it and its consumer and producer cultures, as well.  But enough of my yappin'! Let's boogie!

           This one started off strong and irritated my mouth and tongue. I picked up a habit from my brother-in-law of kind of sucking on the cigar for a few minutes before lighting up. This one really irritated my tongue, which is usually indicative of a more full-bodied, strong, cigar. And about the first inch or so was on the stronger side but after that it smoked more in the medium range. The ash held on fairly well and burned evenly.        I was able to get down to about 1 1/2" before I just had to put it out. for the most part I liked this cigar. It was strong, but not intensely so.  I didn't get any perfumy tastes and by mid morning of the next day (about 123 hours after smoking it) all of the aftertaste was pretty much gone.    All in all I would probably smoke this one again. Unfortunately I can't remember the size other than that it was closer to a corona.

      Good size. Good ash. Even burn. Mechanically a good smoke... but...(gotta have the 'but') It was actually too mild for me. Sometimes I forgot I was smoking anything. I have never had a cigar this mild. With about 1/3 left it became increasingly hard to keep lit and it became quite mushy.  Overall I'd give it about 2/5. The first 1/2 of the cigar gets a 3/5. Less after that.  There are much better mild cigars than this one. Don Diego comes to mind.

      Smoked one tonight with my brother-in-law and his dad (who is 95 and still diggin' cigars).  A nice, medium-bodied smoke that went along fairly well down to about 1.5" after that is was time to throw in the towel. I was getting a noticeable 'buzz' by the time I was about 2/3rds of the way through. The ash formed quite uniformly and I could get 3/4" or so before I needed to tap or it left on its own. Once I was down to the last 1/3 I started getting what seemed to be "perfumey" aftertastes but I was quite sure what it was.  All in all I thought it was a nice smoke but maybe a bit too aggresive for my tates. I find that the more cigars I sample, the more I am drifting towards the milder end of the spectrum. One of the downsides to this cigar has been the very pronounced "cigar-breath" aftertaste. As of this writing I have eaten fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, milk, cookies and juice. I have brushed my teeth and had two bouts with a Listerine clone. It has also been about 5 hours since I finished my cigar and I STILL taste the thing like I just finished it. I can also still "smell" it as I exhale through my nose.  The mild ones, like the Don Diego are like a polite guest: They know when they are about to overstay their welcome and leave accordingly. This one is more like the moochy relative who comes for a weekend and stays a month.  I'll give this one a 2.5/5 overall. SMOKING EXPERIENCE: 3/5 AFTEREFFECTS: 2/5  I'll chalk this one up to experience and enjoy it accordingly. However, I won't likely be returning this way again.

      Smoked one of these a bit under-humidified tonight. This is my first Cuban crafters cigar. I have so far not been as big of a fan of full-bodied cigars as I am medium and mild. Tonight was no exception.  The figurado was a squared off unit with a twisted cap and a little tail hanging off. It drew well and stayed lit fairly easily until I had about a third left. Before lighting, I had the cigar in my mouth and it moderately irritated my mouth and tongue. Most of the irritation subsided once the cigar was lit.  The flavor was strong, but not overpowering. It was like the bass was turned up a notch from typical. My main complaint was that the dang thing would not burn even for anything. I twice relit the cigar to burn off "overhang" only to see it return on the same side of the cigar. Now, I'm no expert at getting a symmetrical even burn but I've never seen anything like this before. At this point I'm chalking it up to a bad cigar. Mt brother-in-law had another Cuban Crafters cigar (different kind but I don't know which one) that burned quite evenly. He was pleased with his.  Being full-bodied I got (and still have as of this posting) some significant aftertaste. Even after a shower, teeth brushing and (so far) 2 mouthwash events, I still have that "wonderful" after smoke smell. Oh, my wife is soooo happy! ;-|   All in all, I'd give this cigar about a 3.75/5 for flavor, a 2.5/5 for smoking mechanics (burn, ash, etc) and maybe a 3/5 overall. Someday I'll try this one again and report back. I've had better full-bodied smokes so I can't really recommend this particular CC line to anyone (at least in Figurado). I have a Mild-To-Full sampler so I will be devoting a few upcoming posts to other Cuban Crafters offerings.

      Wow!  I had my first cup of this stuff this morning. What a crazy coffee! It kind of reminds me of a cross between dark tea and medium strangth coffee. Sort of. It is hard to explain but it has a lot of taste cues that are reminiscant of the Tea family of spices.  Since I have had only 1 cup, the jury's still out on the final verdict. However, I think I kind of like it. I doubt it would become a staple bean but for a change of pace it is quite nice. Its fairly clean and doesn't leave a strong aftertaste. However, if your idea of "coffee" is the heavy, smokey stuff they often serve at diners and the like, you will be amazed that any coffee could taste like this.   Think of it as "The Last Action Hero" of coffee. Its quite different than what you probably expected, based on what you had experienced before, but taken by itself it is actually quite entertaining and satisfying.

      A really nice mild smoke, if you happen to like nice mild smokes. I have been trending lately toward milder stuff at night.   I liked the P del C. The burn was even, the draw was easy but not loose (I punched mine). I got it down to just under 2" before I had to say G'Night. At that point the draw was heating up and what was unsmoked was fairly mushy.   I did get that 'perfumy' hint a couple of times after hitting the 3" mark. I have experienced this across a number of cigars. I'm not sure what that's all about.  Another plus was very little cigar taste this morning. I hate strong "night-before" cigar taste when I wake up.  If you like Don Diego and other mild cigars, try the Primo del Cristo Corona. I can't speak for their other sizes but from other reviews I have read they're all pretty mild.
