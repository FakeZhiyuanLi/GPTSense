      "Knew the signs Wasn't right I was stupid for a while Swept away by you And now I feel like a fool And now I'm, so confused, My heart's bruised Was I ever loved by you?  Out of reach, so far I never had your heart Out of reach, Couldn't see We were never Meant to be  Catch myself From despair I could drown If I stay here Keeping busy everyday I know I will be OK"  wow there is so much going on in my head right now, so many things to think about. after hearing that song...hmm kainis. why does myla keep playing that song?  well maybe there's something about the song that she likes..just like me.  it reminds me of something. that was a couple of years ago. now am 25. yup 25 years old. am done with the first quarter of my life.. at 25, single but happy with everything. Been inlove once, but it just didn't work out. Too bad.   But I wish that one day i’ll meet someone.  The one who’s worth breaking all the rules, someone worth keeping, the one that I’d be holding for so long, and if possible, forever. (that would be great) So why rush things? After all, I’m just 25... But what if i meant to be alone? I guess that's life...=)  "Out of reach, So far You never gave your heart In my reach, I can see There's a life out there For me"
