      okay today was .. well.. weird.. i woke up at 12:30 PM when someone comes to the door.. it was the cops.. now i may be paranoid but when cops come to my house it kinda scares me a little.. then i find out the people behind us (dexter's cousins for those of you who know him) called the cops because our cats were on their brand new 40,000 truck! what BS! i mean you'd think you get a truck that nice you can put it in the garage or conver it up or SOMETHING!! so the cops are all keep the animals on your property! and apparently if you're feeding an animal then it belongs to you, so now aside from our 12 cats.. we've got antoher cat, a family of raccoons, and a possum.. interesting huh? nah probly isn't .. i was supposed to go to aime's and im pissed that i didnt but the whole cop thing and then the fact that i didnt feel real great.. AND the cops almost arrested my step dad for nothign he was saying it was gay and that we didnt do anything and all (it was alittle more vulgar.. but yeah) and they gave him a citation! how gay is that?! nothing else really happened today.. but if something happened to you please post it..   love, me

      okay i doubt most of you know this.. but on easter my cat ran away.. sure it may not mean much to those who don't have cats but i'd had the cat since i was 8 (it was a birthday present) adn i got it the week i moved down to louisiana.. it was 5 years old and i havent seen it since easter.. i miss him so much because he was like a best friend and i dont care if this sounds gay to you you can just stop reading.. well now the other 12 cats we have keep getting in trouble with the neighbors and the police have come to my house twice telling us to keep our cats inside.. but it's illegal to have more then 4 animals confined inside your house and so we dont know what to do but jonathan says we have to get rid of a lot more of our cats and i dont want to lose them too it just doesnt seem fair and last summer a ct i had for 9 years died and i never got to say goodbye.. when we got to the vet to sy goodbye before they were gonna put her to sleep the vet came in and said she'd just died about 2 minutes earlier and he was on his way to call us.. so i saw my cat laying in this room half shaved, with tubes in it, so skinny cuz she lost weight, and she was dead now sure that may not mean anything to anyone else but it meant something to me and now im really upset because i dont want to lose another 9 cats! and it wouldn't be so bad that i lost my cat on easter xept that i dont even know what happened and he's not the type of cat to run away and people in my neighborhood talk about how they shoot cats, and one guy ran over a cat with a lawn moer and i've seen people throw stuff at my cats and you people just dont know how terrible that is! anyway imreally upset so.. bye
