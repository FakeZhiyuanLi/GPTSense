      ok well this is it. the story of KIT. well here we go. ok.  Well KIT is my dear friend smantha's cat. you see, he is slightly retarded. He is cross eyed in one eye, and he is the biggest coward you'll EVER meet. But he is also the sweetest, most adorable, loving creature you'll ever meet. He is more like a dog that way. Cuz cat's are usually bitches. Sam's other cat SMOKEY is suuuuuuch a bitch. And my cat shadow is also such a bitch. It's there nature to have such an attitude. But not KIT. When I used to come over here he would run away from me, and was scared, but not anymore. He will even lie on my face. But it sux cuz im allergic to cat's and so my eye's got all itchy and red and swollen, and my nose stuffy... but yah, cough. that's another story. But back to KIT. I think that he is not only beutiful because of his cuteness and the fact that he's extremely stunned, but he holds no judgments. He just loves you for who you are. people could learn a lot from KIT. which is kind of ironic, cuz he can't see straight. In order to focus, he has to sort of wiggle his head back and forth.. wow. i love him.  He is black and white. white paws, mostly black back. stomack that has white on it. and green crossed eyes.  Weellll that is it. Im gonna leave you now with that image. And when you die and have to decide what animal you wanna be reencarnated as.. choose to be a cat.    meow.

         hmmmm... I was talking to my boyfriend yesterday about life-ish stuff. And you know what I decided... life should be about living in the moment. I know it's such an unoriginal thought... but for it to really make an impact on you, you have to discover it for yourself.      There's not enought time to worry about every little thing you do.     well there was this one time... we all got really drunk (I puked 6 or 7 times... not cool, I know) and when we got to the park, I really embarrassed myself and (cough, cough I farted). yah... but there's really no time to worry about it.      When a friend of mine passed away last year, my friend amanda wrote a song with the lyrics "what if I died tomorrow, what if i died today. what if I lived in sorrow, what if i lived in pain." makes you think eh? So you really just have to keep doing things for yourself. Take some "me-time".      My friends and i all are really priviliged. We live in a good area, with good people. I mean what's the worst that's happened to us.... I lost a friend last year, my sister had a lot of troubles and it really effected my family, I've lost grandparents. but really it's nothing. Nothing that you can't move on from. nothing that will cause permanent damage.     When I was younger, my grandma lived with me. It was soooo hard. she fucking drove me INSANE. but my mom would always say, this is a test. your gonna learn from it, youll become a better, more understanding person. And the funny thing is, its true.           Mick said to me, you have to discover loss to learn how to appreciate things... or something around those lines. It's sooo true. so i guess in a way, everythings sort of meant to happen and everything is kinda a test. You can learn from everything, from your own hardships or others hardships.          so yah..... carpe diem.

       so.. have you ever had something happen, and it feels like everythings totally messed up, or backwards... but really it was all about nothing.    I really think that's the story of my life. ha.. ha. i am the queen of over analizing things. I sit here with sam, and we just go over shit.. over and over.... till we're so frazzled that we've really gone nowhere.   but I guess that's waht makes us girls.       You know what. boys are really confusing. I mean ppl always say it's the girls, but we're really straight forward. I mean we know how to do things, and once you figure that out, it doesn't change. .... but boys. jeebus. it's always different. but i guess you gotta love them for it.  well again im really just blabbing about NOTHING.. so u know.    buhbye.

       Here i am.    Its almost the end of july, and i feel like ive done nothing.    Do you ever get that feeling like time is going, and your just standing still. Watching the world pass you. Really you should be going somewhere, but you dont know where to start. Thats how I feel.    Everyday I'm amazed by something in the world. Theres always something to surprise you, to help you grow. But it seems like, its a temporary change. Like it&nbsp;can't really last. Everything people do doesn't last....    I always thought the people who said things like "whats the point in living and life?" were morbid, depressed people who don't know how to appreciate things, and how to love.&nbsp; But then I started thinking them. I am deffinitly not depressed. I&nbsp;appreciate my friends, boyfriend&nbsp;and family. I do know how to love. Im really lucky to live where i do, to have the peope i have in my life. It's just that, sometimes its hard to see what the point is. Its hard not to wonder where the&nbsp;hell we're going.&nbsp;When I hear about the people who go out and drink every weekend, I think, why? I do those things too. They're fun. but they're a waste of time. Most things are, if you think about it.     &nbsp;   oh no... ive gotten into one of my phylosophical rants. I better go. me and sam are going to read each others blogs... so, untill next time.

      Wanna know what's funny? How easily a persons mood can change, and how many things can effect it. I am so extraverted that people rub off on me a lot. This is not usually a good thing. Cuz if I finally am in a good mood, and then I see someone down, ill automatically be taken down too. grrrr. It's also funny that 99% of the time that the person is down, it is completely un-related to me, but it brings me down anyways... hmm. I think that people who are in shitty moods, shouldn't be allowed to talk to other people.  Well as you can see im not in the best mood right now, and I have no reason for it. Randomly ill get my feelings hurt, or wtv for no reason.  Maybe I should just go to bed. yah I think ill do that... maybe just slleeeeppp. I want to cry. I had the best day, I have awsome friends, I have an awsome life, yesterday was my 17th bday and it was fun. So really I have no reason for this. so goodbye..... maybe ill listen to happy music. Music effects my mmooood toooo. :(   ps... emily U. hahaha

       This blog is about nothing really important, or special. My 17th bday is in 2 days. :D:D:D So far, what iv gotten out of my recent life is, 13 wasn't so great, 14 was cool, 15 sucked asss, and 16 was pretty awsome. So from the way it looks, the odd numbers are not so hot...? I dunno. Somehow I think this year will be good.  "You should write what you know."  Sometimes I think I know nothing, then later, I think I know everything. Its funny how you can't break down your own thoughts, and understand them consistently. One minute, you can make something into the biggest deal of your life, but then later, you see it's nothing........?  Anywho.. back to birthday. i think that ill start off this age by getting good and smashed. Wow. Did I just use the word "smashed"... arg  but anywho.. I am very excited to be 17. YAY... so far, bday recognitions have been fun! GOODBYE!

       I just had a very good day. But then my older brother came home. He's such a jackass. He tries to be so witty, but just pisses me off. fuck. He is 21 years old, but you'd think he's younger than me. I think that if you have a younger sibling, you shouldn't fuck with them too much. You should be there for them, and help them out if they need it, but let them live their own life. Don't tell them what to do, or how to do things, and don't give them too hard a time if they mess up. Life is about learning things for yourself, right? so you know....      Generally my bro is awsome, he is super cool and helpful. So don't get me wrong, he's a good guy... he just sometimes doesn't know when to lay off. Buh bye now.

       My perfect day isn't so much what I do, cuz im pretty much happy doing wtv, its more how ppl are feeling.  I would like to wake up HAPPY! &amp; refreshed, and shower and such things like that. Then I would perhaps listen to music while I got ready. Some happy music. The one thing that alters my mood like nothing else, is music. Then I guess if I had to choose what we did, it would be the river. I LOVE THE RIVER. Its the best place you can go. The only thing that would make it better, is if we brought music there... Then after the river, we would perhaps go to someone house and chill for a bit, umm I dunno know what we'd do, but maybe make A FORT!!!!!! But the rules would be: if youre in a bad mood, you have to leave till ur happy (or talk to someone if ur upset.. wtv), and as soon as someone gets bored, we have to change what we're doing. Then we would pack up a huge, yummy dinner picnick and take it to Ambleside or sumwhere like that (with music) and eat, swim, and hangout. Then when it got darker.... SKINNYDIPPING! yup. and then maybe walk around. Cuz I love walking around at night.  So... anywho.. that is my perfect day. :D

       This blog is part 2. These are the guys I hang out most often with. Theyre awsome.      Fist of all there is my boyfriend Mick. He is amazing and so cute, and really smart. :) I can talk to him about anything and we have so much fun together. I think the PDA can annoy some ppl somtimes.. but wtv. We don't get to be alone together as much as I would like cuz we're always in a big group, but we're working on it.      Then there is my Micks twin brother Liam. He's super smart too, and sarcastic, but really fun to hang out with. It's hard to get him to say what's on his mind sometimes cuz, as sam would say, "he's intraverted". hahah. But yah. he's awsome.      Now Braxton. Hes such a cool guy. Hes brutally honest, and is the only person who can make you feel better with an insult. You can also talk to him about anything. Its good to get advice from him.  He's going out with my friend Bobbi. awwwww      And.. Derek. As sam said, he's just a big kid, a really really big kid. 6" wtv.. i dunno. He's fun to be with, but WALKS TOO FAST....: hahah and sometimes he really sticks his foot in his mouth. Good times.       Well theyre great guys and they've helped make this summer one of the best I've ever had. That is it....buh bye.

       k Well, my rents just left for Kellowna. I managed not to go and ... (gasp!!) convince them to let me stay in the house. OMG. My parents are so fucking paranoid, so this is a big deal. But one of their big rules is... NO FRIENDS.       A  re you joking me.      That is dumb... but I think that I will have friends over. I mean really. Who lets their 17 year old daughter stay at home during the weekend and expect her not to have friends over. I think that when im a parent, im gonna be so much more chill about stuff like this. I guess ill just have to be carelful everything stays ok, and that they don't find out.      Peace.

       I've decided that if people think or feel something they should just say it. No more of this trying to please people. You can make a suggestion, or a decision and if people don't agree then it's not the end of the world right? So we should all be a little less goddamn polite. Believe me, I'm the worst. But if society doesn't give a shit about anything anymore, then why care about making the wrong suggestions?       I wish that people could never hurt each other's feelings. We were all at the fireworks tonight, and my friend decided to call my boyfriend. That is totally cool, I mean, why wouldn't I want to talk to him. But I think he felt like we were trying to make him feel bad for not being there. And that was DEFF not my intentions. hmm so much trouble! but things usually get happier in the morning i hope.

       So. It really sux when you want to make everyone happy, and you have to make a choice, but at the end of it, it was sorta not the best one. Today (technically yesterday) was an important day for me, and the one person I really wanted to see was my boyfriend. He had work in the morning, so we all went to jenns and swam in her pool, it was fun. But then later I didn't know what to do. I had it planned to go to my boyfriends house, and have a chill night with him, but when I finally talked to him, it seemed like he wanted to have some time to himself. I really would have rather spent the night with him. But I went to the fireworks. They were amazing, but I really wish I was with him, especially today.       Sometimes people are hard to read, or maybe I'm just super bad at it....? I dunno. It was just one night out of the whole summer, but its such a crappy feeling.

        I have awsome friends. There are the "regulars"... the people I would consider my best friends.. the one's I would do ANYTHING for. And then there are the other people who I also love soo much, but it seems like they kinda drift in and out of my life. It's hard to describe the people I care about because they are all so complicated, and the way I feel about them changes from day to day, but this is it sorta...        The lovely ladies I hang out with, are really not usually ladies at all.           One of them is Zoe. She doesn't give a flying fuck about what anyone thinks, and is anything but your classic girl. She could out burb anyone without trying, but she's also one of the most fun and beautiful person I've ever met. I've known her for a long time.           Another one of my girls is Sam. She is sooo wonderful, that I would DIE without her. We have so much in common. She can make anyone feel better, and is SUCH a girl. She's the Racheal Green of our group. Sometimes she brings herself down.. but there's no reason for it... she's gorgeous. I met her in gr 6. I met another one of the girls (Jennifluffer) through her.           Jenn is sooooo funny. Shes kinda more of a combination of the first 2. She's similar to me: she sometimes likes to annoy people, she LOVES to sing :D:D and can go from loud to quiet in a second. This girl is an amazing lister, and is sooo much fun. She has awsome eyes and is also so beautiful. I met her 2 years ago.          Another one I just met this year. Kelcey is sooo shy and quiet, and deffinitly knows how to be a girl. She's soo sensitive and would put anyone before herself. She couldn't make a disision if her life depended on it, but we love her for it. She could NEVER piss you off, and it always seems like everything happens to her.         Theses are the 4 girls I hang out with the most.     But I gtg.. I will write about the guys later.... till next time.

       K. you know what I do, I get frazzled pretty easily, adn then I make up all this weird stuff in my head, overanalizing things and what not, and then I make up problems where there was nothing. fun eh?.. hahaha oh well.      Today was SUCH a blah day, probably the worst yet this summer. But I guess that only leaves room for improvment. :)  We did NOTHING. it was such blahness. But then I went to a musical with my parents. yes that is right. a musical. Im suuuch a sucker for musicals. I LOVE them. you can totally escape, such good music, acting, DANCING! It totally made me feel better. The one I was was "Crazy for You". It's the best one I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot.  This year my school put on the musical "Hello Dolly!". That was sooo fun. Not only cuz I love stuff like that, but because soo many of my friends were in it. Also the part I had, was paired with another one. The girl who had that part is a good friend of mine. We hadn't had a lot of time to see each other, so it was really fun to hang out so much doing things we both love.       It always seems so sad how you can drift apart from people. I have an awsome group of friends that I hang out with almost everyday. I also just had my best school year so far, adn this is the best summer EVER! But to gain stuff, you have to lose stuff. There's a lot of people I have been losing touch with, and I also rarely have "me time".... last summer was really fun, but it was more chill. hmmm. But I guess I like it better busy...

       Well today I just found out something sad. We have these family friends that I've known my whole life and their kids are like my cousins (two girls : Amy-24 and Briany-22). The younger one was gonna get married this September but the wedding was just called off. She's had a really tough life. When she was a teen, she was buliamic and suicidal.. but she's past that now. But it still makes me worry about how she's feeling right now. My mom said she's really embarrased and really upset... understandable.     My mom also said, love is hard, (that's not what I wanna hear) that a lot of people have trouble with it.... arg. well I just hope none of my family or friends have to deal with stuff like that. gtg
