      As some of you reading may know, the site  urlLink Gaming Open Market , hereinafter "GOM," was allegedly defrauded for $3000US.  What this site does is trade currency between online communities, worlds, and games.  In this blog, I will mention those terms often, and it's important that I define them as such.  An online community is a group of individuals interacting inside of a predominantly social environment.  An online world is similar, but with less focus on social interaction and more focus on creativity or development.  An online game is something along the lines of a MMORPG, where the focus is on skilling a character by hunting, clanning, or crafting.  Collectively, and generically, I'll refer to them as metaverses, which are defined in many places as  urlLink virtual online representations of reality.   Although I find that GOM provided an exceptionally intriguing service, it was, at least partially, illegal.  Although There, Inc. and Second Life do allow third party transfers of their in-world currency, the vast majority of online metaverses do not allow this.  Lineage 2 (L2), a new release from NCSoft is struggling with this issue in the game's infancy.  Such prohibitive language can be seen in Paragraph 7 of Lineage 2's  urlLink Agreement of Use .  Although one could argue that this does not mean players cannot sell/trade "Adena" (L2's in-game monetary unit), the developers construe it as such and are enforcing it.  In a thread on the official L2 forums,NCSoft's DhevrinNC makes a post (3rd down) that is directly  urlLink on point .    These companies invest hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars of capital into creating these online metaverses.  The environments they create generally consist of their own intellectual property.  This is, of course, changing with the introduction of There and Second Life, but those companies have been remarkably open with their property rights.  Traditional gaming corporations are much less likely to be as giving.  From my lay perspective, it appears as though they see any profit being made by third parties as money being taken out of their pockets.  It is arguable as to whether this belief is based in fact.    Prohibitions, construed from intellectual property law, to prevent those third parties from financial gain are why places like GOM will be unable to function for the foreseeable future.  Even There will not assist with currency exchange issues between third parties.  Second Life's Linden Lab has been much more accommodating, but it seems as though Linden is willing to venture into the forefront of digital property rights experimentation; often to a point even I would find uncomfortable.  This is an unfortunate response, although it is understandable.  The parent corporation does possess a valid intellectual property right in the in-game money and items that one earns or purchases.  Developers such as Sony and EA have always exhibited strong protectionist leanings.    One might argue that because a player earns these items or currencies, the player has a vested property right in them.  However, usage agreements explicitly state that the world exists under the supreme rule of the developers and the player contracts away any possessory rights before even setting foot in the metaverse.  Until litigated, these contracts stand as enforceable.  Conscionability may be arguable, but, for now, these worlds do belong to the developers.  If you distribute their intellectual property outside of the scope and terms of use allotted, not only are you taking that value into your own hands, but you are infringing on their rights in a method that may be actionable.  --DW

      This isn't a personal blog, I intend to use this one as a place to store my ideas on intellectual property law, alternate dispute resolution, and other legal musings.  Feel free to comment.  I do keep a personal blog, from which these are cross-posted.  You are more than welcome to check that out via my profile.  --DW

      It's become customary that when I seriously begin a move, the first thing I do is take down the flag that has hung on my wall since 1997.  From Granville Towers in Chapel Hill, to Rast Hall in Birmingham, to The Quad in Wilmington, to Highland Hills in Carrboro...and now, back to Wilmington; that almost threadbare Jolly Roger has flown by my side.  Now, it's carefully packed away with the two other flags I keep on my walls, just waiting to be unpacked in Wilmington.  One is a 4th Generation Corvette flag and the other is the first flag of the United States.  Sometimes I think we should have kept that one...or at least kept it in a secondary nature of some sort.    These walls are bare, and now I start working on the shelves.  It's rather sad really, but at least it's getting done.  Besides, once I get to Wilmington I'll really be able to concentrate on studying.  I've never felt more at home than in Wilmington...and for these last 2.5 weeks, that will be invaluable.  I will miss Chapel Hill...but not enough to keep me here!   Odds are I'll post again before my move.  Until then...back to packing!  DW

      There is a subconscious.  I know that for sure.  Now, exactly what it does...that's more open to debate.  Being a psych major, I find those types of things quite interesting.  In fact, my senior research thesis in undergrad studied proactive versus reactive aggression in juvenile criminal offenders.  That, in and of itself, became a study in subconscious... although I did not mean for it to be.  Regardless, my power went out for three hours this morning,  from 7am-10am.  I know it came back on at 10am because I woke up.  I know it went off sometime around 7am, because that's when my phone says I called the electric company to report it.  Now...how shall I relate these two topics?  I don't remember any of the above, other than waking up at 10am.  Apparently I grabbed last month's electricity bill, dialed the outage report number, reported the loss, turned off my computer and UPS, and got back in bed.  How do I know all this?  The electricity bill is by my bed, my cellphone is off the hook (and last # dialed is that of the e.c.), and my computer/UPS were off.  That's thankful, since now I have power and was able to get 3hrs of sleep without the UPS beeping every 30 seconds to indicate the obvious power loss. The thought did cross my mind that perhaps I did all that while only dreaming of a power loss, but the flashing alarm clock disavows this theory.   The brain is an amazing thing.  Now, if I could just teach myself to study contract law in my sleep...  DW

      Ok, yes, I tried to stop blogging.  In fact, I did for several months.  I thought that with law school ending, my use for a blog would be very little.  Yet, this is not the case.  I still have thoughts, ideas, and things I'd like to write down.  So long as I don't care who reads them, these are excellent places to put them.  I don't keep a diary or anything, and pictures never said as much to me as words, so here I am again.  Originally I wrote over at livejournal, but I decided Blogger was much more advanced and I liked the interface better.  So, here I am!  I can't guarantee what you'll see here will be entertaining, but it should at least be interesting.  I have a weird mix of hobbies and interests, so it will also be very random.    Laissez-le commencer!  Dave

       urlLink    A picture of my new betta. Unfortunately, Set did not survive his apparent illness, but Horus is doing quite well! I decided to open up the entire 2.5 gallon tank for him, and he's been pretty happy about that so far.  urlLink

      Well, I have found living alone to be just a bit lonely.  Although I would not say that I miss having a roommate, I did decide that I needed some sort of life form around besides myself.  I thought a betta would be a perfect low-maintenance pet.  So, I went with the intention of buying one, but the smallest tank available was 2.5 gallons and came with a betta divider.  Thereby, I was unable to resist the temptation and came home with two.  With the navy blue tank and black rocks, the tank definitely has a dark look.  I've thought of changing the light bulb to a blacklight...but haven't decided on that yet.  With their personalities, I decided on calling them Horus and Set.  Set was fiesty, yet laid back while Horus tries his best to get through the grille separating the two.  Unfortunately, Set has been much less active lately, but I'm thinking it was simply stress as there are no other major "telltale" signs of disease or bacteria.  Neither of the two are exceptionally bright in color, but my guess is that was their prior treatment more than an indication of health.  I've done everything I can for their living conditions, so hopefully Set will continue to improve...and maybe even begin to fight back at Horus a little bit more.  I'll add pictures as soon as I can.  Perhaps once their post-petshop condition improves a bit!  DW
