						   Aujourd'hui, c'est let's bash Nat.  Ma collègue de travail a dû se lever du mauvais ovaire.  Dès que j'ouvre la bouche, elle me rentre dedans.  Un peu comme hier quand je disais que ça ne me faisait rien que le recteur revienne, mais elle était sûre qu'il ne reviendrait jamais (wrong answer!)  Un autre exemple des erreurs de Mme Je sais tout?  L'école Montcalm.  Je lui dit, c'est pour le secondaire, NON, c'est pour le primaire.  J'ai passé devant hier, c'est écrit en toutes lettres sur la façade SECONDAIRE.    Ce matin, je dis, en joke, "mouais, ça m'apprendra à faire du zèle" (je suis arrivée une demi-heure plus tôt mais les ordi ne fonctionnent pas), je l'entends dire "Franchement".  Je lui demande si elle a des nouvelles du périodique en musique, elle répond super bête "j'travaille pas chez Ebsco, j'ai fait mon possible, y'a plein de pério qui attendent qui sont plus importants".  J'ai répondu "ok, de toute façon, who cares".   Elle m'envoie des courriels tout correct, auxquels je réponds légèrement.  Elle me fatigue.  Peut-être suis-je simplement susceptible ces temps-ci, surtout avec tout ce qui se passe en musique, mais je ne suis tout simplement pas capable d'endurer ses mood swings.  Elle ne sera pas là vendredi et moi c'est la semaine prochaine, ça va faire du bien.  Étrangement, je tousse beaucoup moins aujourd'hui.  Peut-être suis-je en train de faire prendre mes distances, de faire ce que je peux faire.  Shanti...

						   I can't say it's a bad day, but I can't say everything is going peachy either.  First sign something is wrong is that I'm writing this at work when I'm overwork and drowned under deadlines.  There is a situation that is so getting to me that I'm getting sick again: I'm coughing (another bronchitis?) and I'm scratching myself.  I love my job usually, and I don't want to leave, but if the situation doesn't improve, I don't know what I will do.  I miss cataloguing books and thesis.  I'm losing the little bit of faith I had in me.  I'm tired all the time and most of all, I don't care if I don't work correctly.  Last time I did that, I was taking afternoons off without telling anybody.  I was self-destructive so other people would take care of the situation for me.  I guess that to feel better, I have to "mettre mes culottes" and take the situation in my own hands.  But I'm not feeling very well and moreover, I don't know what to do.  It's bigger than me just not loving a job, it's somebody hating me and doing all sorts of things to make me look bad.  If I could just not care, do my little things while listening to music.  But I'm a perfectionist (strangely) and it hurts me that someone hates my work and me.  Especially when I'm usually loved (or at least not hated that much) and my work appreciated.  I don't want to be sick again!  I'm spending a week in Montreal next week...for music...could it be that I don't want to go so much that it's playing a role in me being sick?  *sigh*  Shanti...

						   A few days of break.  Well, kinda, because I took days off to "babysit" my son.  Then, on Saturday, we're driving him to the in-laws for a week.  Another holiday for me!  Because, even if I work, I will be able to go at my own rythm and stay at work as long as I want.  Stress free!  Then, it's preparation time to spend a week in Montreal, studying music with Daniel while taking care of Miga and my parents at night.  Can I say that I cannot wait for July 9th to be there?!?  Damn!  I don't know what to reflect on! LOL!  Oh well, let's go clean my desk then...

						   Slowness...patience...I'm downloading a one hour TR show; after 5 hours, I have 55% done.  It's a .zip file, I *pray* it's going to work.    I read somewhere that friendship is the most important thing.  Feeling guilty, I sent an email to Cyb, Isa and Sophie.  I had decided a while back to stop being the one always trying to keep up the relationships.  Isa can be busy with the kid, but dammit, I used to have a baby, I was alone all the time and I was able to keep touch.  Sophie hasn't written to me since February and it was because I sent her a email for her birthday, because she had forgotten mine.  Cyb writes more often, and she doesn't even have a computer at home.  This week, I will send an email for Jean's birthday.  Of course, *I* also remember partners and kids birthday.  I am way too nice.  People take advantage of that.  Friends and family take for granted I will keep in touch.  Colleagues and boss take for granted I will do the work, but that I don't need thank-yous or compliments.  Guy takes for granted I'm going to be there for Miga and the house.  Even my psy told me to get mad sometimes.  But I hate confrontation.  Probably a side-effect of my low self-esteem.  I think that I won't win anyway.  I don't want to be nice anymore!  If Isa and Sophie don't answer back, well f*** off.  That's it.    It's so tough to be all alone.  I don't have any close friends, people that I can actually talk to.  I have to write in my journal or the internet.  That's so depressing...

						   I have to keep memory of  urlLink this link .  The 16th button starting from left is WICKED!  Nice way to procrastinate!  All alone, taking things slooooowly.  Not doing anything, reading and being on the net.  The weather is so-so, windy and menacing clouds.  It's 13:30 and I'm hungry.  A quote that came to my mind:    urlLink Music is soothing   urlLink and calms impatient souls .   Why do I like to look at guys - young, cute guys preferably - when I know pretty well that in real life, *if* I ever find someone, he will have nothing to do with my fantasies?  Am I masochist?  Of course, it's a little bit like looking at a painting, beauty is made for looking at it ;)  And since beauty is in the eyes (or ears) of the beholder, I can look at guys just for the pleasure...and be careful not to take things too seriously, I don't want to get hurt.  Existential question: should I or shouldn't I reveal myself to M.?  Crushes at work are so difficult to manage...

						   I created this new blog because...the old one looked stupid!  And I called this one "The other side of life" because I want to discover and analyze what life (mine and in general) has in store for me.  It can be about understanding the daily "same old" or discovering what is still hidden from me    I'll start from the things I know in my life/reality, and working from this, try to find the other side of everything.  Try to discover new things each day.  My interests are still music, literature, art, spirituality and I still work in a library as a cataloger while taking care of my son.  So let's start this new journey...

						   I am focusing on 3 things tonight.  1) Claude Rajotte is leaving M+.  He will still be around, he has a show on Radio-Canada.  But listening to radio on Saturday between 7 and 10 p.m. is not something I'm used to do.  I liked watching him on tv, hearing his famous critics.  IMNSHO, he's a pure genius.  I WILL listen to him on radio, even if it means closing the computer and the tv early.  2) The Rasmus...my favorite group right now ;)  Their music and lyrics are great, they give a kick ass show, they're cute, Eero is deeply calm and spiritual.  I adore them and listen to them all the time.  I should learn Finnish.  At least, learn about Finland.  3) Why this blog is in English, since I'm a québécoise pure laine.  Well, English IS the international language, so more people can figure out what I'm writing if I get visitors.  Moreover, I need to practice so I don't lose my English.  And finally, sometimes, my thoughts come more easily in English.  But sometimes, I will write in French.  It will depend how inspiration comes to me.  For example, my site  Church of Eero  is in French, despite its English title, because that's how I imagined it.  Hey, why not visit  urlLink my site ? :)

						   I don't want to work!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to find info to get a pile of thesis ready and I don't find anything.&nbsp; I'm sleepy, I'm bored, and I know I will want to go to the restaurant again tonight.&nbsp; But I must resist!&nbsp; It's not that warm outside, so no reason not to eat at home. &nbsp; I wish I could stay home, and work on my Finnish.&nbsp; Or do something interesting.&nbsp; I have a lot to do, but nothing interesting. &nbsp; And it's still looking like we're going to have a thunderstorm.&nbsp; Beurk.

						   Poor J.&nbsp; Her car is broken again, her bf is acting like a moron, she's crying, no money, nothing to expect for her vacation.&nbsp; Compare to her, my life is a fairy tale.&nbsp; Everybody is in good health, I've decided to take the car to go to work, things have calmed down in music. &nbsp; Now if I could only lose wait and gain money, LOL!&nbsp; I'm trying to eat healthy (again!), to eat only if I feel hungry, to NOT eat my emotions.&nbsp; And I'm trying to exercize a bit.&nbsp; Again, again, again... &nbsp; I want to learn Finnish.&nbsp; Stupid maybe, but hey, I need a hobby, they say. &nbsp; Back to work :)

						   Finally, the week in Montreal wasn't that bad.  It was interesting and fun, I learned a lot of stuff.  I was stressed out at first, but when I decided to put Sylvie out of my mind (for last week and forever), I felt better, more calm.    Actually, I can't wait to come back to work, clean my desk and start anew.  If only I could keep my resolution about exercices and food as well.  *sigh*  I ate so much in Montreal, I gained 3 pounds in 5 days!  And I spent so much, I already have more than 1000$ on my Visa.  Tomorrow, I'll try again.  Less food, less spending.  *re-sigh* Determination has never been my main force...

						   Ben oui, Keep It Simple Stupid.  Actuellement, je suis très déprimée.  Baboune de Guy, attitude de Miga, travail so-so, la semaine à Montréal et surtout, surtout, je suis GROSSE!  Rappel de mes deux résolutions du jour de l'an; perdre 15 lbs + carpe diem.  Au lieu de ça, j'ai gagné 10 lbs.  Bon, une part appartient au méd, et ça c'est sûr que je ne le lâche pas.  Mais il y a une grande part de paresse et de "manger mes émotions".  Qu'est-ce que m'avait dit le kiné?  - Diminuer le sucre - Augmenter les protéines - Faire les exercices - Marcher   Ce n'est pourtant pas si compliqué, vu comme ça.  Pas de régime, de recettes, de calories à compter.   Diminuer le sucre = pas de dessert (même pas de fruit le midi ou de jus); manger plus de viande; faire mes redressements assis; prendre des marches aux pauses et le midi au lieu de rester devant l'ordi.   Je suis sûre que si je respecte cela POUR VRAI pendant quelques semaines, les choses devraient aller mieux.  Tomber, c'est humain Se relever, c'est divin Rester immobile, c'est sans dessein

						   Hummmm, maybe I was a little bit susceptible on Wednesday.  I went to the restaurant with my colleague, everything went well.  She's like that, direct, no compromise.  Sometimes she's wrong but she will never accept it.  Oh well.  Another thing to go wrong: Suzan is quitting Guy.  2 nights ago, at 5:00 a.m., he was crying over her.  Gee, nice.  Personally, I think she just needs attention, so she's doing a scene.  But stupidly, Guy asked her to choose between her husband and him.  He can't enjoy things as they are, he always has to run, to be the one in charge, to own.  Well, now he's alone, turning around in the house, he doesn't want to work, to go skating, to go with Miga, he gets mad at me. Bel été en perspective.  So between work that sucks, Guy who looks "charming", Miga who is a pain in the ass but only with me, my health that is down the drain (my shoulders hurt today), my little fun visit to Montreal next week and the weather that is looking like thunder's coming, I'm feeling so good that it's scary (sarcasm). "The future's so bright, I need to wear shades" (refrain connu)  And they are not even going to the camp tonight...

						   Je dis pouce.  J'agite le drapeau blanc.  J'écrase.  Après l'otite dans l'oreille gauche la semaine dernière, les visites à la clinique, le docteur idiot, la journée manquée, les gouttes, les antibio, on remet ça dans l'oreille droite.  Mais même si je retourne à la clinique, quoi faire de plus puisque j'ai déjà les gouttes et les antibio?  Miga est chialeux (duh!), Guy est bête, je suis fatiguée, mon corps capote (hier, crise de grattouille sur le bras; aujourd'hui, j'ai des frissons sur le cuir chevelu et je me sens faible).  Et toujours ce sentiment d'incompétence, de ne pas réussir à faire ce qu'il faut et de perdre les 24 petites heures quotidiennes qui me sont allouées.  Un collègue au bureau m'a dit hier que je n'avais pas l'air bien.  Je suis grise.  Je m'oblige à être correcte, pour Miga et pcq j'ai l'auto.  Pratique mais angoissant.  En plus, je suis en pleine restriction budgétaire.  Cartes cachées.  Avant, j'avais juste des remords quand je trichais dans ma "diète", maintenant ajoutons quand j'achète quelque chose.   Seul plaisir en ce moment: écouter de la musique (pcq même lire m'angoisse à cause des piles de trucs à lire qui m'attendent).  Regarder le vidéo de Guilty et admirer les mouvements de Eero, Aki et Lauri (pauvre Pauli, il y en a toujours un que j'ignore).  Je vais d'ailleurs mettre Into pour cataloguer des trucs difficiles en musique qui m'attendent.  à +
