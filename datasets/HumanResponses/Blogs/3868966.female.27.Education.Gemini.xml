      Well I'm not sure what a Blog is and so this will be me figuring it out as I go.  LOL of all things I'm in a pretty crappy mood tonight too.  Joy.  I have lots I should be journaling about and I guess I might as well work on it here.  I used to have an Open Diary, a site that is still near and dear to my heart.  But that got compromised by someone and I took it down and then never had the umphf to start over.  Whats on my mind tonight.  Who knows.  Well what WAS on my mind this morning at work was this.  He spent the night last night.  That was cool, always is very nice to be in his arms.  To be aware of his warmth all night.  I actually didn't sleep much last night.  Told him this morning that I didn't know why but I do know.  I may only have 4 more weeks with him.  4 more weeks to last my lifetime of having someone hold me and love me for no reason, just because they do.  He holds me...all day sometimes.  I love the morning light shining on his face as he wakes next to me....his blue eyes gazing back at me with his soft smile.    Lying in the darkness, just before sleep sometimes he tells me things.  Last week he drifted off in my arms and when I had to leave he woke and told me he knew he was falling.  And I said I know.  I held him for longer before I finally had to leave.  The other night we were sleeping and he sat up in the night...sort of upset or sad.  He said baby i just don't want to lose you.  And I said so don't and held him and he fell back to sleep with me.  It's like his fears and heart show in the dark of night.  And I know because mine do too.  When we drank cider the other night...things started to be said that we feel...and are afraid to say.  I still can't say it so much in words.  I want to and I miss him so much tonight it aches.  But early this morning...before the sun rose, I looked over at him and he reached for me in his sleep and held me close to his chest.  Said I love you baby.  I said I love you too...then I held him so tight....so much it hurt because I ache for him, ache to tell him what's in my heart.  Ache to be with him and really give all of me to him.  It's ripping me open that in a month or so it may be over.  Maybe not...but what if.  What if it all changes...we go apart...  I know we can live through that...but that's not the point.  I can't spend my life wondering what would have been if we had given this a real go.  In my dreams I want to share a home, to have him come home for dinner at night and to wake with him every day.  I want to play our games and watch our movies and have our friends.  I want to see what our babies would look like and take them places.  To make pictures of us that match the dreams in my heart.  How could I have known that he would be so much so soon and that I would never want to let him go.    I think I'll stop with that cuz I don't wanna talk about what I don't wanna talk about anyhoo.
