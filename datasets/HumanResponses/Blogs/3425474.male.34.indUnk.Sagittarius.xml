      i work with this crazy lady. she is super o.c.d. (obsessive compulsive disorder. all of the films most be perfectly straight in the storage box. all of the rooms stocked,blah blah blah. she talks really loud and sh'e always questioning the doctors orders right in front of the patients. for example.....jane fell down and twisted her ankle. the doctor orders a foot x ray. mnow the doctor is an "IDIOT" for not ordering an ankle. she's saying this to the patient......

      this 13 year old came in to the hospital and needed x rays. he already had a temp cast on and he was moaning and wincing and grimacing,saying vicodin wasn't helping. he hurt it thursday, and now it's sunday. so i did his xrays , which was a big drama, and there was absolutely nothing wrong with his arm. its funny because we had a 7 year old last night with a fucked up elbow-broken and dislocated who was a little champ. didn't cry, just sucked it up and held the positions. then we get that kid today and he's 13 and crying with nothing wrong. his mom was there defending him and condoning the behavior. fishy. i bet the mom is eating his vicodins. and giving him tylenols. vics should easily kill pain. they work on really bad fractures.

      i'm going to get my rotr tix today. i love rotr. most people have this misconception that rotr is just a bunch of hippies. not true. It becomes a little city for 3 days. the citezens of this little town consist of a cross section of californians that like to party.ORE&WASH also.... people of all ages, economic backgrounds, all come together to party and listen to some of the worlds best reggae artists. there are no police inside. people are responsible for themselves and others. somehow things run really smoothly. there are hundreds of volunteers that bust their asses dealing with all of the garbage generated by 15,000 people over 3 days. porta potties are pumped and cleaned several times a day. the eel river is there to cool off in. if you are interested, you should get your tickets now.

      people bitch about things all the time, myself included, but the reality is that we are truly fortunate. we really do have good lives here in the u.s.a. even if gas is $250/gal we still have the luxury of driving escalades with shiny rims and leather seats anywhere we want by ourselves on credit. I love my life. surfing,snowboarding, partying. I always reflect on just how good i actually have it.

      i work in a hospital and my god, i see some scary ass shit.The er where i work is run by a bunch of self rightous nurses, that seem to be ordering all the tests for the doctors. they order xrays for the wrong reasons on the wrong body parts. then they get all defensive if we question them. then we have to do the bogus ass xray, and the poor patient has to pay for it, or in alot of the cases where i work,the patients can't pay, so the county taxpayers foot the bill  its lame. this e.r is the worst. what sucks is that they really think they are the bomb.

      ALOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE ANTI TOW SURFING. I CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR POINT, ESPECIALLY AT MID SIZED TODOS OR MAVS, BECAUSE THESE ARE I TAKE-OFF ZONE BREAKS. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MOSS LANDING,A BROAD BEACHBREAK WITH MANY PEAKS, THE ANTI TOW COMMITTEE IS JUST BASICALLY PLAYER HATING. THEY CAN'T STAND TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE CATCHING BIGGER,BETTER,AND HEAPS MORE WAVES THAN THEM. OH, THEY'LL BLAME THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS FOR THEIR POSITION, OR THE CHOPPY WATER THE PWC'S CAUSE, BUT IT REALLY IS A CASE OF ENVY.      ONE OF THE MAJOR ARGUMENTS IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO TOW WHEN ITS SMALL ENOUGH TO PADDLE. THIS IS A BUNCH OF IGNORANT SHIT.ON SMALL DAYS MOSS PEAKS ARE SPREAD OUT SOMETIMES HUNDREDS OF YARDS APART. YOU CAN ONLY  PADDLE A SURFBOARD ABOUT 2 MPH.THIS REALLY LIMITS YOUR RANGE AND WAVE COUNT. A PWC HOWEVER CAN GET YOU HUNDREDS OF YARDS IN SECONDS ALLOWING YOU TO WORK ALOT MORE AREA, AND CATCH A HELL OF ALOT MORE WAVES. ANOTHER THING PEOPLE WHO ARE ANTI DON'T REALIZE IS HOW FUCKIN BADASS IT IS TO BACKDOOR A 3 FOOT WAVE GOING 25 MPH. IT IS SO DAMN INSANE, BUT THEY'LL NEVER KNOW, BECAUSE YOUR MIND COULD NEVER CONCIEVE IT. I PICTURE A GRAYING 200 LB. MAN ON A 7'8" SLOWLY CHUNDERING ALONG AT A WHOPPING 8 MILES AN HOUR. THESE ARE THE GUYS THAT GET PISSED ABOUT US TOWING IN ABOUT 3 PEAKS DOWN.

      ITS NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE THINK. ITS LIKE A HAZING. BUT PRETTY MINOR. I WANT LOCALS FROM OTHER SPOTS TO TALK SHIT TO ME. DON'T LET ME WALTZ IN AND HAVE MY WAY WITH YOUR SPOT. AND IT IS YOUR SPOT AS LONG AS YOURE THERE TO CLAIM IT.

      LOCALISM SUCKS FOR SOME, IS LOVED BY OTHERS. I LOVE IT. IT'S ROOTING FOR THE HOME TEAM,TRIBE,ETC.WHILE TAUNTING YOUR OPPONENT. ITS AS OLD AS HUMANITY. ITS A SURVIVAL MECHANISM THAT KEEPS OUTSIDERS OUT. COOL PEOPLE HOWEVER, CAN SLIP IN UNDER THE WALL OF LOCALISM, ANYWHERE. WIMPY CRYBABIES WILL LET IT EAT THEM UP AND RUIN THEIR SESH. THATS HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK. WEED OUT THE HALFHEARTS.
