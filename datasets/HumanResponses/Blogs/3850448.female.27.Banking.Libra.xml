       I was shocked&nbsp;by the news that my friend was accusing me of trying to convert her religion. I just thought it was all the people around her who are accusing me but it hurt me more to find out that she's the one whose spreading the accusation. I can't blame if the people who heard her will get angry. Well perhaps it was all misinterpretation. Perhaps some of my sharings especially the negative ones let her think that I'm trying to convince her that her religion is not that good. There are things that better left unsaid. All the while I thought I found finally a friend who is an open minded person whom I can share all my feelings and experiences about God and religion. And there are also times that I also want to give her advice for all the problems she had and perhaps being too concern was bad too coz your intentions may be interpreted wrongly. I can't tell her that I was ill because of her. Thinking too much about her and analyzing religion...&nbsp;I went crazy! Past is past. I'm well now so its better to leave everything behind. I will just be extra careful so that I won't be accused anymore. But how come I'm still sad?

       Today, I’ve accidentally deleted my yahoo messenger. I tried to upgrade it but later I found out that I couldn’t since I don’t have authority anymore to install to my pc in the office! I miss my friends huhuhuhuh…. So here I am, just dreaming to ease the pain of being alone. Well, if my wish will be granted, I will wish to become a princess. Where everything will be served and all I have to do is sleep when I want to, shopping, traveling, etc. Next to me is my prince, where love never ends… If God will ask me if I wanted to be angel, my reply would be: make me a cherubim so that I could sing all day to you. If I will be asked to enter politics, I will seek the highest position in the land – president. I will stop graft and corruption, encourage foreign investors, implement death penalty to stop the crimes and improve education. If I will be given chance to study again, I will choose medicine. I realized now how important is health and how much I want to help other people. I think I can help more if I am a physician. Haha, keep dreaming…

      Life, is not all that bad my friend (Hm-m-mmm...) If you believe in yourself, if you believe there's someone,  Who'll walk through life with you. You'll never be alone, just learn to reach out, And open your heart. Lift up your hands to God, And He'll show you the way.  Refrain: And he said, "Cast your burdens upon me, Those who are heavily laiden. Come to me all of you who are tired of carrying heavy loads For the yoke I will give you is easy and my burden is light Come to me, and I will give you rest."  When you feel the the world is tumbling down on you. And you have no one that you can hold on to. Just face the rising sun, and you'll see hope, And there's no need to run. Lift up your hands to God, And He'll make you feel alright. (Ref.)

      Friends do come and go. We met different people everyday and mostly these people become our friends. Moving out, traveling, or simple misunderstandings can cause the lost friendship. Yes, it’s sad to lose friends but some things happen so fast that before we knew it its time to say goodbye. Nevertheless, friends make our daily lives bearable. They are there to laugh with, to cry with, and to share our stories… They are same people who will correct you when you commit mistakes. I can’t imagine a world without friends!

      I could say I have everything every girl wanted. A successful career, a loving family, a thoughtful boyfriend, and charming friends. Yet recently my faith was shaken. I could not accept the fact that I was given illness. Why me? I have been faithful to you Lord; I have been an obedient child. I know I let you down sometimes but do I deserve this punishment? Isn’t it the cross that You have given is too much for me to bear? Can you blame me if I came to hate hearing mass or even the priests? Can you blame me if I stop believing You exist? I still remember when a beautiful nun first introduced us to each other in my pre-school. I shouted for joy, now I have a brother! Isn’t it I talked to you everyday? I visited the church every morning just to say hello or even the little things I wish to share with you, I utter a small prayer. I grew up loving you. I know I had pledged of becoming one of your servants when I was sixteen. I know I have broken that pledged when I fall in love… I remember 2 years ago You took care of me when I accidentally fell down the stairs in Malaysia. I only got bruises and scratches though my head hurt terribly. My friend wanted me to go to a hospital but I pleaded not. I just took pain relievers for several months and pray a lot. Alas, during my illness last year my head had been checked and for me it’s a real miracle that the lab shows no abnormalities. **Sigh** Well my illness is not life threatening and it is treatable yet here I am hating You. I’m sorry. Help me Lord to carry this cross. Help me to endure the pain emotionally. And thank you for still being there in spite of everything.

       A new month. A new team. I will be transferred officially to the support group. Don't know til when. Maintenance group is OK. The tasks were not that heavy, still have time for surfing and chatting with friends. I will be missing my old team, the friday meeting with Sir Roger, the hazard of going to the office every Saturday. On Thursday, I will have my last lunch with them. It is a small party for the job well done. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to my new team. Well I don't have to worry about completing 8 hours a day, INSIDE the office. I still don't get the idea of strictly staying 8 hours a day in the office. They say its for productivity measure. But who really knows if you're doing your project?? Luckily in the support team, I don't have to worry about completing 8 hours since they are not into it unlike the development team. Whew, its August! I can smell Christmas in the air...
