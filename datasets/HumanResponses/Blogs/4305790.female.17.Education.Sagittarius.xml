      Many inspiring environmental innovations are featured at Rolex Award. One of the 2000- winners was  Mohammed Bah Abba , a Nigerian who created an earthenware fridge named Pot-in-Pot system. The technique used is evaporative cooling. That may not be a new idea, as many Slashdotter commented  here , but upon further reading of Abba's invention, it can be seen that he applies those ideas effectively and is successful in helping his community. The invention also has potential to be applied globally where climates are warm and money is scarce. So he deserves the award after all.  There are more inventions that I like, such as  David Irvine-Halliday's LED light  and  Hans Hendrikse rollable water container . I've seen plenty of darkness and women carrying heavy luggage on their head on my car journey from Medan to Jakarta, some thousand miles in distance. I wonder if the rollable container can be used for carrying other stuff, such as liquid rubber. It may prove to be infinitely more useful if it can be modified to carry a variety of materials. Shall investigate this.

      The birds in Singapore is disappearing faster than a speeding bullet. Who else but a professor would notice a speed like that? An NUS professor, along with several colleagues from Down Under, published a documentation about the state of mammals, birds, fish and butterflies on the island.  It's great that we know this. So what are you going to do? If you are the professor, apparently the wisest thing to do is publish a book on the plight of birds and animals in the region. I'm impatient. We wrote so much about the dinosaurs and look where they are now, extinct!  So let's shout a battle cry. Please suggest any effort we can make to the relevant authorities to save the poor animals. Better yet, think about something yourself and do it. Just don't make an endangered animal a pet. You might be sued for that.  Full article on Singapore's Birdman  here

      How can  freecycle.org  appeal to people like me? Interested in the environment, want to do my bit for it, have lots of stuff that just hangs around gathering dust and likes to share. I shared lots of files in cyberspace, you know? It appeals to me precisely because I can give my wanted but not useful stuff to the masses. We are blessed with materials that we want but we do not need. Don't believe me? Stop. Take a look around your room, workspace or whatever and count how many things you don't need. The answer is invariably more than one for most, because we don't need all we have, at least we needed it then, but not now.  So what can you do? Share them, or give them through freecycle.org. It's not only sensible, you're helping recycling in a big way. See there's 3 types of recycling: downcycling, upcycling and freecycling. Downcycling is what most people think recycling is, like giving a computer away for their parts to be disassembled and form something useful in the lower chain of the system. Upcycling is what writers of  "Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things"  claim to want to do. Their book is written in a new form of papers, the  Durabook . When you're done with the book, they claim that it can be upcycled to form something better than a book, like parts of a car.  Freecycling is what I'm preaching now. It is a harmless way of distributing things, it's fun as you can share, and it's easy to do. Just join the freecycling.org group in your cities and post things to be given away. Similarly if you see something you like that people post you can email them to request it. To me, this is the elusive win-win situation.  Here is a link to  freecycling.org singapore .

      I saw many FYP projects that are related to the environment in the  FYP page . They can be developed by those who are capable, and read by those interested.

      I read in the Straits Times today that Nanyang Polytechnic won the Green award. They used a  rainwater collection system  that won the Greenwave 2003 competition. Quite ingenous really, but not difficult.  So here is is my new vision for NUS SAVE. Create an organisation that has two faces, one to organise usual environmental activities, the other to think about innovations that are related to the environment. Just like what Nanyang Polytehnic has done.  Full article for the green award  here

      I am frustrated at my webmaster's lack of cooperation in creating a blog for my organization. I'm the vice-chairperson for National University of Singapore's Students Against Violation of the Earth (NUS SAVE), and I have many ideas. But my webmaster loathes implementing those ideas. I may assume too much, but he did not include any blog-like mechanism in the original SAVE website. You can check it out  here . I am tired of arguing with him, so I just implement my own suggestion in the form of this blog.  This blog will discuss about the environment, links to environmental websites and stories relevant to the environment. I hope you find them educational.

      You can choose to buy ethically, just like people in the United Kingdom.  An excerpt from the Straits Tmes:  "People who choose to go completely 'ethical' here can also put their money in the Cooperative Bank, place their investments in the Jupiter Ecology Fund, buy insurance from Naturesave Policies, use Body Shop skincare products and wear People Tree clothes."  Some may construe this as a good way to be enterpreneurial. But be warned, business about the environment seldom have sensible economics in it unless the business is directly related to environment. Like the  SembCorp Environmental Management .   Full article  here .

      Kaya Yoichi, the Director General of the  Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth  in Japan elaborated 4 important points in the direction of future technological developments in the energy industry.  1. Expansion of the use of renewable energy. 2. Promotion of atomic energy 3. Stepped promotion of hydrogen systems 4. Expansion of the use of distributed systems  Point number 1 is divided further in 2 section:  a) Use of ambient energy for air-conditioning and to heat buildings. b) Development of methods for the large scale usage of renewable energy.  I am collaborating with a friend to invent something of the 'a' variety. It's a cooling device for rooms. Will try and test for the rest of this month.

      I remembered my friend and his joke. He got a scholarship to study in Japan. And in his letter, he complained that the first obstacle he had to overcome is not the language, the change of culture, or being homesick, but learning how to throw garbage away? Is it? Or am I kidding? No. I am not kidding. He told me each household has 3-5 trash bins, one for each type of garbage. And making sure which bin to put what is not an easy task to do. That will sound a bit troublesome and less convenient for us, but it will help sanitation workers a lot and the rate of recycling will be increased. And, I looked around my place. Only one hole to throw in everything. In fact, in NUS, there are some special trash bins for stuffs that can be recycled. But maybe they are located at not very convenient places, or the covers are too heavy to push back, or any other excuses on earth that we can think of. The fact is that they are "a bit" empty. I myself have stared at one for some minutes, but I found it a bit difficult to use. In fact I did not know for sure which bin to put which stuffs inside. And, if you take a look at the trash bins outside the LTs, you will find that they are always full of cans: Coca-Cola, Coffee, Soya Bean, to name a few. All those cans can be recycled. But, as they have been put there, I am not very sure how their fate should be.

      Well, since I'm the head of the project, I think I should put my own view regarding this :p  When Surya offered me this project, at first I thought this is an ordinary project. Collecting goods that people don't need/don't want anymore and give it to other people who are looking for the goods. More like a donation, but different target :p  But then when I looked more into it, I began to think that this is actually what we need. I mean, how many of you are thinking of giving the goods you don't need anymore before you dump it away? It sounds trivial, many of us would probably ask our friends whether they need the goods or not. But when nobody nears you want it, u'll probably toss it aside. This is where freecycle comes in. The idea is simple, it's just giving more network coverage for people to give and take the goods. Imagine how many unused goods would be 'saved' if all NUS students participate in it. Especially with people who stay in the dorm or the exchange students, they tend to throw away their goods when they moved out.  So I think this project will be a good way to start freecycling habit. When we already have the network, things will be much simpler. In the end, it's all about caring for others and caring for environment :)

      Iowa-spawned Thin Film Technologies manufactures and markets solar-power panels in lightweight, flexible strips. Some current and anticipated applications of the film strip include stiching it on the sides of a beach blanket as an outlet for radios or televisions, fastening it to cell phones to recharge the batteries as you talk outdoors, and applying it to the top of RVs to charge internal batteries for use when camping.  The technology can be glanced  here .  Quoted from Marketing Research.

      I read an article in Strait Times a few days ago, it was about Hong Kong being hit by smog from southern China. The situation was tremendeously bad, forcing the pedestrians to wear masks or to held their hands over their noses in futile attempts to stop breathing in particulates. This is just another issue of air pollution striking the globe once again. How bad could pollutions be? Obviously, polluted air creates discomfort to the communnity and it basically ruins the fresh air we as people have the right to breathe upon. This is basic knowledge. However, as my reading of the article progresses, I begin to understand how the issue of pollution is not just nesting around discomfortness, there is more to it.  Extreme pollution, especially caused by smog and wind, leads to haze...and worse comes to worse, due to this "invisibility" occuring in HK, a catamaran carrying more than 120 passengers collided with an oil barge. The air pollution index ranges from 70-134, where a scale of 100 was considered high already. Hong Kong's pollution is lying on the extreme end. A number of factors contribute to this bad air phenomenon. Across the border, the number of factories and power plants are increasing each year. Car ownership is intensifying, although liquified petroleum gas has been encouraged. In Hong Kong itself, the territory's largest power supplier, CLP Power, is generating energy for sale to the power-starved mainland. At the same time, it is shifting towards greater use of coal.  Pollution is a social distress, yet people all over the world can't stop its expansion and massive destruction. I want to highlight that pollution is a very serious issue, putting the entire mass of the globe at stake.

      1. Only people from NUS are developing it. Where are the NTU and the polytechnic guys?  2. Too many things must work together for it to take off. It can, given time.  3. Where do you get the hydrogen? Electrolysis? Where do you get electricity for electrolysis?  Full articles  urlLink here

      When the government must subsidise the green dream, what do you do? Do you scream that that is almost impossible in thirld world countries? To wait for green products (be it electricity or cars) to become commercially competitive will take an awfully long time. So what can you do?  What really shocked me is that Singapore does not make it mandatory for EIA (Environmental Impact Assesment) for developments in her land. Also it has not acceded to Kyoto Protocol due to the its smallness and lack of natural resources to tap on alternatives (such as hydropower or geothermal energy).  Can we circumvent that natural resources lack? How? Must the solution be policy driven like described below?  An extract from New Scientist, July, copied from the Web: (sadly, I have little time to type the full article I photocopied)  "Worldwide total energy is shooting up. But the proportion of electricity produced from renewable sources has fallen from 24 per cent in 1970 to 15 per cent today. It is becoming clear that market-driven policies will not be enough to realise the dream of going green. To make it a reality many governments will have to change their thinking, and make a long term commitment to renewable energy by bringing substantial subsidies and incentives, so says a recent House of Lords report."  This quote is from the same article and is particularly pertinent: "At present, the only way to make most renewable technologies attractive is to subsidise them, though wind power can almost hold its own."Germany has developed a policy that has sent it to the top of the world league table for wind power and now has 40 per cent of the world's entire wind-powered generating capacity.  The success is entirely policy driven says Thomas Johannson, an environmental economist at the University of Lund in Sweden. When you see how much this cost the German economy it is dwarfed by the advantages."
