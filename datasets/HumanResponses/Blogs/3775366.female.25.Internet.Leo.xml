      yes how very exciting.  i already use the widely-known and popular "xanga".  i thought i would try something alittle more private and less known by the 'xangers".  so let me start off with who i am.  my name is sintar, yes sintar, well thats not my real name of course but thats what i have called myself since the dawn of internet.  i'd like to think of it as a screen name like "trinity" or "neo", well i am no computer hacker but i do use the computer an aweful lot.  i am in my mid-twenties (scary) i actually will be celebrating my 25th at the end of july.  i live in southern california in orange county near the beach in laguna.  it's nice here, i drive a pos pontiac grand am, i love sanrio and i play video games, now for a chick i think that's cool.  i love playing final fantasy and the silent hill series. i am currently learning japanese, to understand all my manga in kanji! j/k  i am an avid pot smoker (just to get that outta the way).  and on this blog i am going to rant and rave about certain people, place's and things.  you know nouns!  i thought this blog could be more of my political and dark side, the non-cheerio side the sarcastic side.  maybe while listening to jack johnson a million times today i can be revived back into a non-sarcastic world.  oh!  i know why i wanted to start this new blog!  i wanted one that was private meaning vip, meaning "the one my roommate doesn't read", yup, i have one of those kinds of situations.  although my roommate normally takes month long hiadiouses (is that how you spell it?) she is here now and i already feel the tension from her very presence.  she is very pushy and very needy, as soon as she got back she starts barking orders and telling me she had hoped matthew (my boyfriend) and i had re-organized the storage closet on the patio!!!  geez she makes me want to rip my hair out or maybe rip hers out.  i think i will stay in my room or leave queitly whilst she is asleep.  she wants to do yoga with me know and i am like, yah know i kind like doing that by myself.  i am not a 34 year old single woman who hangs out with younger girls full of trouble and drama so that i feel like i have some purpose in life!  a purpose to give advice to every stray bitch that crosses my path.  i am not kidding folks, and while she is away expects me to take care of these stray puppies  that are so naive i let go of the leashes and they look at me with this dumn look as i shoo them away.  yes i may be harsh an cruel but if there's one thing i cannot stand it's capitilization and stupidity.  above all though is ignorance and that's exactly how i view these girls.  i guess my roommate feels she must be the one to take them under her wing, literally, one was living in her rooom for awhile, but now has moved out and has yet to bring back her key.  so yeah i am at a loss for how much i feel in this situation, yet i won't complain too much considering she is always gone.  well i hope you enjoyed this little romp through "my world".  join me again tomorrow, same bat url, same bat name! i am off to watch my japanese drama watashi no aozora!

      Next friday is my 25th birthday...I've been thinking about the past oh...10 years..passively and agrressively rummaging through memories stopped in time with the magic of photographs, downloading music off Kazaa-Lite from the mid 90's and entertaining thoughts of what could have been.&nbsp; Honestly sometimes I miss being young.&nbsp; But than I think of all the things I have been through and I think, no wonder time goes by so quickly it really had to.&nbsp; It had no choice.&nbsp; I think about previous relationships and friends, wishing sometimes they were here than thinking twice and glad there gone.&nbsp; Alot of people I have been meeting recently have been so young, young like as in 19-23, and to me that's young, I think they have a few more years to enjoy.&nbsp; All the while laying claim to a feeble body already.&nbsp; Shit how must that make my friends my age and older feel?&nbsp; Probably pretty shitty.&nbsp; One of my good good friends, she is 34 and she looks fantastic she acts young, looks young.&nbsp; So what the hell am I complaining about.&nbsp; I think I held on too long to things I don't need anymore like stuff in my head regarding my past.&nbsp; I mean I have been dating the same awesome man for 5 years!&nbsp; Not married...yet...we talk about it, but it's not too important to us, maybe when we move to Japan.&nbsp; I love him dearly he pretty much is my husband, everyone knows us as Matthew and Aubree, not Aubree...or Matthew, but together as one.&nbsp; Its so funny when I was a teenager I always wanted that sooo badly, and now that I do it sure feels good.&nbsp; I guess that's why I think about my past sometimes, to remember how precious the present really is....okay I am getting of the subject.&nbsp; Me and my inane rambleings. So I I have been thinking about these things alot and I guess I am just remembering because it feels like soooo long ago, yet not...heck I dunno if I am making any sense, but it just all kind of festered for awhile so I have been at a loss for connecting with my past, thinking maybe walking down memory lane wouldn't be so bad, but honestly now that I am sitting here at my computer really putting this all together I realize that it's all just some past experiance, key word here PAST.&nbsp; I love my present and I am excited about the future, I hope things go well.&nbsp; So far so good.  *Oh by the way, I went overboard and wrote some Inyasha FanFic, but like the sick pervert I am I wrote it in Hentai style, yah I know, naughty naughty.&nbsp; Even my boyfriend was like holy shit Aubs this is extreme.&nbsp; Yeah maybe I will tame it down alittle, I mean Inuyasha can wait alittle longer for the good stuff muahaha.

      Every week day morning I enjoy watching Fujisankei, it's a all Japanese program, for the first hour they play news, and the local stuff going on in Japan, it's a riot compared to what is important here in the U.S., but believe me I am jealous, I wish the US was more like that, but alas, I will have to keep wishing.&nbsp; Than at 7:30 am my show comes on: Watashi No Aozora, I am sooo addicted to this show, it's about this single woman(Nazuna) who get's left at the altar by her groom and is pregnant with his child and so she decides to keep the child and bring him up herself, well now it's been 7 years and now he wants to live with his Dad, his Dad is accepting of it, but Dad has a girlfriend and little son does not like this, and so begins the Japanese style drama I have become so addicted to.&nbsp;  This weekend was really boring, I did nothing of any relative nature.&nbsp; I did take a nice drive with Matthew around Laguna Beach, it was one of those sunny california beach weather days, so of course we took advantage of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I didn't get to see I, Robot which really upset me, but there are soo many damn people in this county it makes you wanna scream, every movie theatre we went to in a 20 mile radius had like NO parking at ALL!&nbsp; It totally sucked and by the 4th place I got so detested and frustrated, I told him to forget it and let's go home so I can do laundry and clean house, you know all those fun things! Well I am off to fish for a job in the big fat Ocean full of nothin, let's hope I get a bite!

      Well things have gone from bad to worse.  Amy (the roommate from hell) is coming home this evening.  The back injections will stop until next week so from hell (literally) aka Palm Springs she will come stomping into the house war paint and all.  Yes folks the time has come and the tension has begun.  I can already feel my heart rate going up and my body temperature has already reached 100 degrees!  This is what this 34 year old woman does to me.  See this is the first time I have ever lived in a roommate situation (and my last).  My boyfriend and I thought it would be nice to save some money in the pit of dispair aka Orange County.  But noooooo, we got more than we bargained for, and I know she's only here for about a week and gone for a month, but a few days is all I can stand of this woman.  As soon as she gets home she wants to hang out, have us cook for her, take her places, go with her places.  She tells us what she expects done around here, and I am like WTF??!!!!!  And when she isn't here she's constantly calling and reminding me of things I need to do (which I am already fully aware of mind you), and these are my personal responsibilities which don't EVEN concern her, HELLO!! I already have a mother thank you!  So anyways she's coming...soon.  I have already made plans to go somewhere tomorrow...shit, and the next day and the next. I realize she's just a 30'something single woman with no life and no friends to speak of and that's just the reason why she wants to butt into my life, but NO!!!  If I needed a caretaker for my life I would ask for one but I am perfectly capable of taking care of ME!!!  (breathes)  And she calls herself INDEPENDENT, on the contrary, Matthew and I are actually trying to comprehend her living on her own EVER!!!!! Yeah, can't you tell I just love my roommate.  See she use to be my boss at my old work, but than work closed on us (it was a MOM and POP's bookstore).  And we were left with nuthin, and so she gets this great idea for us all to move in.  Well than when we moved in...you start to see "the change", oh yeah, it always happens.  They become who they have always been, just the person you DIDN'T want to see.  So anyways hopefully soon she will be moving to that God-Forsaken land known as the desert.  It's less humid out there and better for her back...well honey don't expect me to help yah move out when the time comes.  I literally helped you move in, you find someone else to move your ass out!  Oh and by the way...don't let the door hit yah on the way out! Okay I have vented...it it feels good.  Ahhhh... >

      i finally saw Farenheit 9/11 and on the most patriotic of days, (as you couldn't guess) yes, Independence day.  i thought it quite fitting to see a documentary regarding our current president and all his foul ups.  yah know my favorite part was the ending...bush speaking to some supporters in tennesse, fumbles as he tries to say: "there's an old saying in tennesse, well i know it's in texas, but maybe in tennesse...fool me once...shame on...(sorting through brain for correct "saying")...shame on you?...well you can only fool me once."  yes folks that's our president mr. bush himself completely shameless as always.  i really enjoyed michael moores film, i'm not really a huge fan of michael moore, but i like all the work he goes through, cuz you know our fat happy lazy asses won't do it.  it shows how completely lacking of any real knowledge we have.  we are only in this for the pursuit of happiness man, haven't yah heard?  ignorance is bliss man! life is good when you let other people fuck with it, all i really want to complain about is my bad back and my pain killers and anti-depressants that aren't working anymore, fuck the fact that bush is trying to take over the world like he's some roman emperor or something.  instead of building roads we'll build oil pipe lines! Yeah! something to look forward to, a wasted job on a fastly diminishing resource, i call that smart thinkin don't you? of course this has all been my sarcastic thesis of the day.  are we really going to vote bush in again? or are we going to pick that john kerry fool, the ex-vietnam vet, the rebel, the liberal, the democrat with more to offer than just a can 'o' beans.  well i don't see which one is in the light better, they both spend most of there time bickering back and forth at eachother about there glory days and how one acheived more than the other blah blah blah.  funny thing and interesting thing is they both garduated from Yale, same year, and they are both part of that idiotic hierarchy of Fraternities known as the rich boys club, or is it skull and bones or something to that lame respect?  i don't know, but how can you vote for one of the lesser evils?  i am at a complete loss, man i thought i had a hard decision to make when the governor's were running here in california, no, this is far worse, and far more important, i feel like for the mainstream, politics have become cliche and boring "out-of-fashion" as some might say.  but they are more important than ever before, we are entering a new millenium with nothing but waged war and more enemies than I can count.  people all over do polls and do you know what they say...just below Hitler..bush is the next man,  yes i know it's crazy, i saw it on cnn, and yes i know cnn is a dem station but it's no better than fox and there repub status.  the funny thing is where's my parties station of choice, MTV?  i think not.  i am a libertarian damn it, i beleive in less government and more taking responsibility for your own shit.  well i think i am done for today. i still have no clue who to vote for, and i must add that for some odd reason people think they have to choose one or the other on this 2 party system, well it just ain't true folks, you really have more options, you just have to go out and look them up,  if your reading this right now that means you have the capability to look up other oponents, well what are you fucking staying here for?! get goin, go look for someone to change out world, shit vote for yourself if you think you can do a better job, it's better than just throwing your vote away. well folks maybe i'll be here tomorrow, maybe i'll be here next week, no one ever know's, not even me.  but i know this, when my opinion turns into a tangent in my head, you'll notice than, a new entry.

      I know I know, your probably thinking, geez does this person even exist anymore?  Well if you keep up with my Xanga than you'll know how busy I have been, I must give my full attention to Xanga, that being by far my fav place and where most of my friends are but I have claimed some new friends, especially Hatsumi (you ROCK)!  I have kept this thing because it's nice and a way to vent my anger against my roommate without hurting her feelings, to some people it may seem like I am talking shit behind her back, but the truth is I feel for her and I care about her, but still, none the less she upsets me sometimes and so I must resort to silly trickery such as this.  Of course I have nothing to say about her right now. She is moving out in a week and she is a little freaked out about moving but I understand I would be too all by myself.  I am now getting fully acqainted with my job, which I love by the way, It's very simple but very busy and detailed, my boss (Moses) is awesome and very cool to work with, we talk all day about random shit and so do me and my co-workers.  We are a crazy mixed-up bunch but I really like them all and can't say enough about them.   Life is getting fast paced again and I am coming to a slow realization of my desires to have fun. flirt and party again.  I do think I may even "roll" again, yes I know I know, but it won't be that big of a deal, besides I'll definitly get my bestfriend and her fiancee to join us, we always have fun together doing it, so it should be fun.  Knowing us we will probably glowstick all night until our arms fall off. Hee hee.  Well thats about it for now folks, hope it was entertaining.  Soon I will have something to write. subject matter : The Olympics, oh yeah baby, I couldn't let this one go...we shall discuss "taipering"...hmmmm fun.

      Well I pretty much have the job in the bag, just have to do my pee test tomorrow.  I am very excited and cannot wait to start working again, it will be nice to once again feel like I am part of something other than this computers chair.  So another rant regarding my roommate, here it goes: So she calls me yesterday to tell me she has filled out and application for a small town house in the desert.  As she is telling me all the great things about this place I'm thinkin to myself WTF? You already signed a 1 year lease with us?  I knew that she was interested in moving out soon but this is ridiculous!  So as she's blabbing on I'm also thinking how do you even begin to get ok'd for a place when you are unemployed and have a brand new car that you already have extended family members paying for? (I know your already thinking, is this for real?  Yeah me too.) So than she goes on to say that if this goes through that she would like to go down to the office and place my Fiancee's name on the lease and take hers off, which is okay but not at the moment.  THEN...(yes not finished yet) then she proceeds to tell me that the refridgerator that we received as a gift from John (our old boss), she would like some money from us for it, yet we never paid for any part of it and she's the one moving out!!!! Yeah this really pissed me off, she's so fucking petty it's not funny!  I don't know how I didn't just hang up the phone on her, I mean she was sooo fucking excited to tell me this ridiculous news she called me three times, 3 TIMES!!! WTF??  She's insane I just know it.  So now she's on her way home from the desert and I told her we need to have a serious talk.  I am not letting her out of this lease until I have firmly planted this job down and received at least my second check from them and all utilities are safely changed into my name.  Then right before she's done talking to me she proceeds to tell me that nothing is set in stone and that she's not even sure that this application will go through.  So I'm thinking (again) why the fuck did you spend the last 15 minutes telling me all this when nothing is confirmed.  Man I just wanna take a sledge hammer to her brain, she's 34 years old and I'm sorry call me over critical but I just think she's pathetic I mean she's older than me and I've got my shit more together than she does!  I look at that and I see a very sad person, I honestly think she's on way too many drugs, she herself says she has some type of "back issue" but no Doctor can figure it out (hrmmm maybe it's just in your head honey), her families a mess, she's got a 45 year old sister that just divorced her husband, she dresses like she's 21 and she buys and owns expensive shit she can't afford and expects (literally) expects people to fork out money for her to be able to pay for these things, most immature and untogether woman I have ever met.  My roommate is definitly the mother figure in all her relationships and she even tries to treat me like it but I won't let her because I already can take care of myself, thank you!  I guess she blames everything on her fucking backround and I hate when people do that, it's like yah know what I realize that our past's shape who we are but honey you've taken it alittle too far and I know she expects pity from people because she tells everyone about her horrible past, knowing that no one could possibly have had worse ( and maybe she didn't either..can we call it over dramatized)?  She would never admit this because to your face she'll exclaim that she's independent and deosn't need anyone's help and never has.   Yeah right!  Well I'll tell yah one thing you psychotic bitch...your not fooling anyone...especially me. Okay there I've said, I got it out of my system...I feel better.  And I exit with a little bit of my religion to ease the passing of my feelings. "It is the way of the Tao, that things which expand might also shrink; that he who is strong, will at some time be weak, that he who is raised will then be cast down,and that all men have a need to give,and also have a need to receive.The biggest fish stay deep in the pond,and a country's best weapons should be kept locked away.That which is soft and supple,may overcome the hard and strong." ~the Tao See I have some semblance left in me.

      For the last 2 months I have been getting up early or staying up late and waking the same.  I have had a nice 2 month vacation from the duties and stress of work but alas the time has come for me to join the work force again, too fun for me eh?  Ummm yeah..believe it or not I am actually excited about it.  I think I was going through a series of what most people call "cabin fever", yeah I had it and I had it bad.  You can only clean your house so much until you're scrapping up the dust off the patio.  There is only so much TV to watch in a day and only so long I can spend online designing new web templates for myself, I have yet to even attempt to make one for myself here (be patient it will eventually come to exist).  So the interview for Pitney Bowes went very well I should probably start very soon, all they have to do is a drug test (no prob) and a credit check (crosses fingers) shit I hate working for Banks and Mortgage companies, damn I hate them credit checks, yah well I had alittle touble way back when, so that means you won't hire me, cuz I screwed up my own credit, no I will not be working with YOUR credit, oh thats too bad..DAMN!  Yeah well lets hope thats not what happens.  I mean I am good at what I do, Mail Room supervisor, oh yeah!  I love warehouse work, I hate dressing up for businesses, it really sucks, Ive done it and it sucks so there.  So anyways thats about it.  My birthday was very fun, my family and fiancee went to Sambi's of Tokyo, I had like 4 Cali rolls and a ton of shrimp, I wish they could have made the crab in the cali rolls w/out Mayo but oh well.  Anyways it was nice, I got really drunk after drinking about 4 cosmo's made by my fav lil Japanese bartender dude! He rocks, he always get's me wasted!  Well nothing more to say.  Hatsumi and I have become group "bloggers" now! Woo hoo!

       I've been on a self-induced hiatus lately ( which will only get worse as my attention will be all-encompassed witnin my Sims games).  Have had a lot of paperwork due-mostly finals-for the summer classes I'm taking. Just finished the draft for my first critique paper from my Critical Writing and Analysis class. I'm compareing opinions on both the Psychoanalytic approach v.s. the Queer approach. Interesting stuff (not!)  My one Photoshop 7.0 class is finito.(Thank God). That heinous bitch who calls herself a teacher managed to lose all of my work at the last second (and blamed me, saying I didn't turn anything in). So, after I was done stareing at her opening and closing craw of a mouth and having daydreams of meeting my fist w/ her face. I managed to re-download everything into her file folder on her desktop. So help me God, if I get my grades and they're below a "B", I'm making a formal complaint to the Administration about her. (Jamie thinks I should do it no matter what, but I did learn something, so that's why she's getting her chance at redemtion).  On a lighter note-I finnally got more RAM for my computer at home! I'm sooo geeked-the thing runs like a secret military spyplane (aka: Fast as Hell). Not only that, but I managed to install everything all by myself (currently feeling uber-geeked out & powerul as the TECHNNOOOOOOOOO MASSSTTEERRRRRRRR). The icing on the cake in all of this:  urlLink The Sims.  Not  JUST   urlLink The Sims  mind you, but all of their expansion packs minus: Vacation & Unleashed (those are boring). So, I am finally able to start up my God complex and plant my ass in front of my monitor decorateing a cybernetic dollhouse for the better half of a day.  I'm in Heaven.

          I can't believe the utter stupidity that putting on a white dress creates within certain women.     Unfortunately for me, I got coralled into being a bridesmaid for a friend whom I'm not all too friendly with. She's one of those "friends" where she knows all your other close buddies and so, she is part of the general "group", however, you wouldn't choose to have her over at your sleepover if you could avoid it.    As society's mores would have it, this type of decorum allowed to those "friends" who orbit the group the way Jupiter orbits our solar system is also reversable and can be used against any other poor soul within said group.  Hence.....I am now a bridemaid.  The wedding is to be held this July. She's been planning since before last Oct. Things have become understandable messy. not that anyting is too terribly unorganized, but the cash that I'm dolleing out for this wedding has reached, in my opinion, astronomical proportions.  For a bride whose job is a middle school science teacher and gets her clothes from urban outfitters, she's somehow managed to create, within a year, an extremly high level of couture and extravangant taste-and has pretty much left her bridesmaid w/ their bill.  Ex: A plain, black, strapless Vera Wang bridesmaid dress for over $300.00 (not includeing the fitting). The SAME EXACT DRESS can be found, at David's Bridal for $100.00.  Ex: She has already had, since last Nov. over 10 showers. Since April, not one week has gone by where there are not at least 2 invitations for something involving her wedding.  Ex: After already spending $1,000.00 on her wedding SO FAR, her bridesmaids gift to us is homemade earring. (think hippie meets glam....yeah, exactly).  And here's the illustrious cake topper to it all: Since she asked us to be her bridesmaids, she has always mentioned that her mom & dad will fit the bill for hotel rooms for the wedding party to stay in (including our husbands). I have yet to hear anymore about it, so I inquiered about it this past Mon. her email response to me was that her parent's have rented out 2 rooms, w/ 2 double beds each where we can hook up and bunk with another couple for Fri & Sat. night. ................................we're bunking................. You. Have. GOT. to be. Friggin. Kidding. Me.  So-I've promptly left her a voicemail stateing that Jamie and I shall NOT be spending a night in a shared room w/ another couple and that we can just meet up w/ her for wedding arrangements those two days.   (I just can't believe this cheap-ass woman).

       I just  happened  across this new "blog" site (normally I use LJ), so I thought-why not have another? So-this is my first post. For older posts and for upcoming ones (because I'm also going to post on LJ) got to:  urlLink Adventures in Noodle Hunting .  So, the latest? Well...I went to get my nails done yesterday. Nowhere special, just a little place at the local mall. While I'm sitting there, the pedicurist started saying how pretty I was (whih obviously would make anyone feel niceand special). Unbeknowest to me, sitting in the chair next to mine was a local t.v. producer. She had overheard the pedicurist and I talking and gave me her card. She wants me to email her so she can send me a list of modelling agency and photographers in the area. I'm a little apprehensive about all this (after all, I'm no runway-just a pretty girl). but I also figure-you never know till you try and even if it's just something local-at least there's some extra cash involved.  We'll see how this plays out.

      This latest week has been awful.  So bad, in fact, that I hardly have the energy to write about it.  &nbsp;   So, just let me say this:     &nbsp;  1.) Got in a fight w/ my boss. Told her off. Still going into work tommorow.....can anyone say 8 hours of awkward Hell????   (huh, I can't hear you...)    &nbsp;  2.) Finnally finished being a bridesmaid at my girlfriend's wedding. Thank. Friggin'. God.  Now I know why God left humans to their own devices.  &nbsp;  3.) Have a final due on Thurs. A final which requiers a paper I haven't even written yet, a poem I need to bring to class (and I detest poetry the way some people detest V.D.), and a "presentation" (whatever the hell that means).  &nbsp;   But, there are 2 great things to round off this post with:     &nbsp;  - After this week, I go away for a weeks vacation.  - I found the coolest site ever!  urlLink   Tokidoki       &nbsp;   Enjoy :)   &nbsp;

       Have  FINALLY  managed to get the comp somewhat up and running again. Right after I go and install all that RAM and start feeling nerdly proud of myself, my comp crashes. Almost completly. honestly...I blame my husband. he's completly computer illiterate and God onlt knows what he mistakingly downloaded. However, after clearing out my temp files, de-fragging the comp, deleting never used programs and what-not. I have now, somewhat managed to get things decently up and running. Therefore-more products have been added to my  urlLink Kawaii-Gaijin shop :)  Please check it out-even if you're not buying anything-I'd still like to get suggestions and feedback. Thanks! On another side note.....I feel kinda' stupid for mentioning this, but hopeful all the same...I'm gonna' try for a modelling job. I know-I know, I'm too old and a little short but I figure if nothing else, I can get some part time pocket money. Anyway, I think I had mentioned this in a previous post, however, hadn't really followed through. Well, this time I have. I actually got a cheesy head shot taken-just to give the agency an idea of what I look like. nothing fancy-I may still hire the fancy ones out later.  urlLink Anyway-here's a peek  :)  Yay! maybe I'll be able to leave my mind-numbing, dead end job after all :)

        Yayyyyyyyyyyy for me !!!!!!   First of all: Today (7/7) is my B-day :)  Say Happy Birthday to me......SAY IT!!!!!!  Have had a wonderful one so far (although in 19 min. it'll be over *sob*).  Have been spending the last 5 hours parked in front of my monitor. My main goal, you ask? (yes, ask you shall). Well, I came across Cafepress.com which allows you to create your own online store with little to no risk. I figure it'll be good practice for when I leave my peon job at the realestate office and at some sad attempt at regaining my lost youth and soul, I open a trinkets boutique (yes, yes, laugh at me, but you shall  CRAVE  my boutique's strawberry goodness).  So, while I'm waiting like a miner in California to strike it rich off of my internet store  urlLink (Kawaii-Gaijin) . I'm passing the time along w/ a HUGE pain in my neck (and nooooooo, I'm not talking about my adoreing fan....I mean, husband). I'm talking about the muscle spaseming pain thats rocketing itself up my neck and into my brain cavity.  I think I shall go to bed now.

      I just bought the old version of Nokia's N-Gage system.  Yep...that's just how cool I am.  Because of this ultimate purchase of "cool", I spent the last two hours re-entering all of the information/phonenumbers I had programmed into my phone (for some reason I couldn't get my chip to copy over). However, now everything is up and running, I've set up all of the bells and whisteles and am already stuck in the Tomb Raider game I purchased for it.  I've also made the grandiose decision to trade in my pink GameBoy Advanced for more N-Gage games.....(blasphemy, I know...I mean the damn thing is see thru PINK)!!!  But sometimes you just need to follow progress, ya' know? (maybe the N-Gage comes in colors? Like,...I don't know...pink?)

      There's nothing quite as soul cleansing as listening non-stop to sad songs and playing a game on Tom Clancey espionage (aka: sneaky shoot em') Playstation2 games to make a person feel a God damn good deal better!!!!  (Well, maybe instead of Tom Clancey it could be Silent Hill 4....but then, I'd never leave the house :)  P.S: Thanks Sintar for the encouraging words :) Feeling better!

      This weekend went by pretty darn fast w/ only a few issues of hilarity!  Fri. night-just stayed in and layed videogames all night. Seriously, like up to 4am!!!! It was wonderful to have that large of an amount of interrupted, self indulgent gameplay :)  Sat- Hung out w/ my mom & dad pretty much all day walking around downtown N-ville for one of the town's many "fairs". Actually had a wonderful time. I'm lucky to have parents that are so fun to hang around with-not many kids have that now-a-days. Later that evening, went out w/ Jen, a girl that used to work w/ me here at the office a while back. Her and I went and hit the Post Bar and had a fabulous time. She got DRUNK! I'm talkin', "stand up and pass out face first" kinda' drunk-so I let her crash at my place for the evening. Her and I met up w/ Flash &amp; my other friend, Patrick for some late-night boogie-ing! Wish I had brought my camera, but I completly forgot!  Sun-went to Ang's place for a "Girl's Luncheon", so that she could formally ask us to be bridesmaids (I'm excited for this one). Unfortunatly, my behavior (aka: the fact that I got a massive attack of "the shits"), forced me to leave the party early! So-I spent the rest of the afternoon nursing a bottle of Pepto and laying out in the sun trying to sweat the poison out of me. At around 6:00, Jamie and I went to mom & dad's to celebrate dad's B-day.  Now...onto some meaningful stuff............. For the 3 people that ever read this post: Myself, Sintar &amp; Anonymous, you're probably wondering why my previous post has been "altered" and the comments blocked. 2 reasons.  1.) When Anonymous posted, they accidentally posted the same thing twice. I tried to figure out a way to delete one and leave the other, but to no avail (this Blogger site is slow for me to learn for whatever reason). So-I can only "block" comments.  2.) I don't trust "Anonymous".  What I mean by this is, although I could very well be wrong (yep, that DOES sometimes happen), I'm about 90% sure I know who anonymous is.  I believe that the best solution to this problem is to let this person swim in the mire of their own making and not give them the attention (negative or positive) that they so obviously and desperatly crave.

      (hahaha-I LOVE Babel fish). yep, I cut my hair (as stated above), and I have to say-it looks magnifique ! I've got some MAJOR bangs kickin' and have also dyed it about 6 shades darker. Took another 1/2 inch off the bottom &amp; had the whole mop thinned out. Lookin' quite sexy I might add (I would have used the french word for sexy, but I've come to find out that the french word IS "sexy". Go figure).

       I've been getting very inspired recently by other peoples websites-They're just so damn creative.   And I feel, w/ my creative "juices" being as dry as they are, when I feel the urge to purge some creativity, I better roll w/ it.   So-Here ever is my very first attemot at a desktop:   urlLink   Peek-a-boo        Granted, it's not the best ever..and I know I can do better (and I shall), but I still don't think it's too bad for a first attempt :)
