      I had this teacher who hates women. It would take ten guys before he would call a girl for recitation. No, it's not that she can't see us, but she chooses not to see us. How do I know this? Well, she deliberately ignored me several times already! And I know she saw me because I had eye contact with her!!! But I could feel she was just looking right through me. Like I wasn't there! And then she would call the guy behind me or beside me. What is this? What does this mean? Classic case of women being vindictive to other women? I have concocted several theories about this... (1) She feels threatened because I'm a young, nubile girl so ripe for the picking, while she's a woman in her mid-thirties with no prospects for a husband and no sex life to look forward to. (2) She feels threatened because not only do I have sex appeal, but I'm smart as well! She has only one of my traits. (3) her boyfriend dumped her for a young, fresh, and smart girl... Like me... Okay, okay, maybe all of these are way unbelievable. But is it?! Actually, she does it to all of us... girls that is. I also noticed a different kind of smile, just for the boys. Or maybe a lilting tone on her voice when she asks them a question. And sometimes, even a small giggle escapes her.  In reality, I think girls can be very vindictive when they want to. Personally, I'm way up the  vindictive chart  . My boyfriend usually complains about it since he gets all the crap. All my friends know how bitchy I can get. I can't help it! I feel like throwing up everytime I try to be cute and cuddly. Everytime I try to act like a dainty, little virgin girl, I get rashes all over! But deep down inside, I still know how to appreciate people. I wait until people show me their evil side before I show my fangs. And I don't get all snappish to girls only, I give the guys their fair share!  It's not really bad being a bitch as long as you know your limits. To my teacher, I say...I weigh less than a hundred, can eat anything I want and still stay sexy...how about you?!

      Check out my brother's photo gallery linked on this page. He has found a passion in photography... a very expensive passion, I might add! I know he's a pesky little boy but, he really has a way with cameras.  urlLink (www.pbase.com/el_jong)

      I'm a virgin in this blog thing... just thought of putting up one to release my pent-up emotions while I'm here in grad school. Oh yes! I'm in grad school. I used to be in law school but I realized that it wasn't for me. Then I went to work for an airline. I was with the baggage department. It was hell and heaven at the same time. It was fun but working night shift and getting cussed at by irrate passengers took its toll on me. So, I transferred to a recording company. Nah, I wasn't a singer. But I hang around with many of them. The social life was great but pay was awful. I finally decided I needed to stop all these nonsense and do something about my life. So, here I am. In grad school... staying in the dorm. It's not all that fun but the friends I found and the experience I'm getting makes it worthwhile. I just hope I get more than I invested... or rather... more than my parents invested.   I just have a little over a year left... let's see what's in store for me then...

      I can't believe I'm going to say this...but I MISS SCHOOL! I'm bored with my AC already. It's such a brainless and thankless job. I remember now why I love being a student. Having an allowance...getting to eat anytime of the day...taking naps between classes...and most of all, having your friends around you. Yeah, school is full of shit and lots of work, but at least your suffering with your friends.  I have seven weeks of practicum to go... well, maybe six if I can wheedle out of it so I can get some sort of vacation before school starts.  I'm also looking forward tormenting the freshmen next year. Bwahaha!

      Me and a few of my classmates had a hilarious experience today. We're suppose to have this practicum thing for school for the next two months. We're supposed to act like consultants for a company so we can use what we learn here in school. It's supposed to start on the 17th and I'm panicking already because I don't have any company yet to work for. So when I got called for an interview, I was hoping this could be my back-up company in case no other company would call me anymore. I went there with Inyas (an Indonesian), Jeff, and Stephen. We met another classmate there, Lori. We sat together in a small room and there was a projector in front of us. They presented their product, it was a golf membership club. It's like getting playing rights in different golf courses around the Philippines. I was thinking...  okay, this is good  . Then slowly, they showed us the membership fees, and I'm like,   so far so good  . Then they brought out another slide about recruiting members.   Uh-oh!   That sounded weird. Then she was talking about pairings and direct referral fees... whaaaat!!!! A pyramid scam!!!!   Okay, that was so harsh. The politically correct term is:  Multi-level Marketing . Stephen and I were texting each other though we're a few seats apart. He goes,   do they want us to sell?   Then Lori, like the real Chinese she is, starts asking questions about how to earn money. I was just counting the minutes when I could leave the place. Stephen and I still exchange texts, Inyas kept on sneezing behind me, and Lori still asking how she could earn more money! Then Stephen asks how will we be graded since we were supposed to give a paper and the company was suppose to grade us. The girl goes...  Oh, by the number of people you get!   Hah! I don't think so! And before we could recruit, we were suppose to be members ourselves. We were supposed to pay Php20000. I was itching to storm out of the place! When she mentioned about the interview, I politely told her we had to get back to school for our class... which was true. Stephen and Inyas couldn't wait to get out either and said we could just schedule another interview, never mind that they weren't my classmates in Finance! Lori wanted to stay but didn't want to be left there. She was hooked with the millions they claim she could earn! So we left, acting like true Asians by telling them we would keep in touch and even exchanged calling cards. We went down the building and took a cab back to AIM.  Back in school we ran to the secretaries in charge of our class. We told them what happened. I couldn't stop laughing! Apparently they thought of making money out of us by helping them do networking. Oh! It was horrible experience and a total waste of time! But it was really funny!   I should have followed my instincts! I wanted to ditch the interview already but just couldn't bring myself to ignore it.  Now I know...always listen to your instincts!!!

      After so many weddings Tini and I went to, finally I get the bouquet, and finally he makes an effort to get the garter. Well, we didn't have a choice... we were set up. We've been together for almost six years now. We have attended several weddings and somehow, we managed to get out of that particular part of the event unscathed. But thanks to the 4J Boys, namely Jay Tan, and the groom himself, AA Albano, we had our fifteen minutes of fame. It was definitely well-planned! They put all the names in a fish bowl and one by one they call out a name. The last name to be called gets the bouquet. Jay pulls a switching stunt and voila!   "Mericon Clemente, you get the bouquet!"   Neat huh?! Of course, once I got the bouquet, the garter went to Tini! He broke out in cold sweat! His hands went cold and clammy! Hahaha! Serves him right! Hope he dreams of this tonight. As for me, I just went along with it. At least I'll be in the wedding pictures! It's inevitable anyway. Whether it was this wedding or someone else's, it was bound to happen. Now I have a small bouquet of pink flowers here in my dorm room and a blue garter hanging over my desk.    Are we next? Maybe! After a couple of years, when it's my turn to throw the bouquet, I'll remember this moment fondly and hopefully give the same memory to the one who will catch my flowers.

      First year is almost over. It was almost a year ago when I suddenly thought of taking my MBA. I thought of going to  where the the grass was greener  but I guess I'm such a true blue gal I couldn't fathom my life there (no offense to the Archers...). Instead, I ended up here in front of Greenbelt. Yup, AIM. I can't believe freshman year is finally over! I'm relieved because it means I'm half way through...and yet, until I get through my action consultancy (on-the-job-training) and my thesis, I can't celebrate yet. Business school has been really tough for me since I'm not really good with numbers. Unfortunately, there's a lot of that here. Nonetheless, I'm surviving and I've stopped questioning my  fate  everytime I pass. We're into our last week and I'm up to my neck with papers, presentations, and exams! Gawd! Just today, I did a presentation, submitted a paper, and did my orals in Finance. What a day! I just had to grab a beer after dinner, a reward for torturing myself.  Everytime I have a day like this, I get all existential... what is the meaning of life? Why am I here?  well, you know what? I don't have the answer to those questions. I'm twenty-five and still screwed up with what I want to do with my life. I thought I could find them here...Alas! More questions abound! I would like to think that by the end of these two long years, I can say to myself... "Conci, you've finally found you're calling. Go forth and wreak havoc to the world!"  But, getting out to the real world is worse now than when I finished college. Five years ago I could still make mistakes and fool around. Now, that's pretty hard to do. My parents are expecting me to be a little more mature...duh?! They would love to see my life with a better direction...well I say... I'm headed to the mall! But I think I've matured more here than in my three and a half years working. I think I could handle a lot more things better. After head-butting with forty indians, four vietnamese, a nepalese, singaporean, indonesian, and other aliens... I think I'm better prepared to deal things thrown my way.  Enough whining... I've released my philosophical musings for the day. Aaaahhh... the bed has finally called and the beer is settling in my head.

      Apparently four years in Ateneo made a bigger impact on me than 16 years in St. Scho Marikina! Ateneans in AIM are totally revamping the orientation Ateneo style. It's gonna be fun and exciting! Lucky for the next batch they have people like us. Well, we'll get first shot at the hotties and the cuties so that's incentive enough. I hope we go down in history as the best party class ever... I think we're doing a good job living that reputation already.   Can't wait for next year and start partying again!!! Oh, and study, of course.

      I'm already greeting all the Dads out there... Happy Father's day! My dad is in US right now with my mom so, no family lunch or dinner for us this year. But at least I'll see him when they get back on sunday. Last minute hurrah before the day ends. So... papa... love you! Thanks for sending me to school and loving me even when I'm a brat!

      I took it upon myself to play matchmaker to some of my friends, with the help of Tini of course.  To date, I already set up three blind dates.  Unfortunately, I could only claim success with the last one.  I won’t mention any names.  I don’t want to incriminate any of my friends, or even Tini’s.  The first couple, the girl was a feisty one and since it was an ambush blind date, she was already resistant from the start.  I’m partly to blame.  The guy, I guess, felt it wasn’t going to work too so, communication was already strained.  One thing led to another…BAM disaster!   Couple number two’s date went pretty well.  However, it didn’t go further than that.  What happened? It’s what we call in school cultural miscommunication.  I’m being diplomatic when I say it was nobody’s fault it didn’t work.  They were just coming from two totally different worlds!    The most recent couple dated last Saturday night.  It was a success by my standards because after three days, I haven’t heard any bad things from both of them.  I can also sense both had fun.  Even I had fun hanging out with them!  Yup, Tini and I babysat but left about 30 minutes earlier.  During the date I tried to get the 411 on what the girl thought of the guy, but we were interrupted while we were in the bathroom.  I think Tini was able to squeezed something out of the guy while we were doing our thing.  I continue to play cupid to my friends.  So, anybody there willing to be my guinea pigs, just holler!

      MBA2005 in AIM have lived up to the Instituion's   unofficial motto  ,  "Study Hard, Party Harder" . Last friday, the signal has been sent out to everybody for a get together in Blue Onion. Despite the rains and some of us still taking the CFA exam on sunday, we met up. With a beer in hand, we entered Blue Onion. It was full and no empty table was in sight. We found a place to sit by the ledge and in no time, was dancing for the whole bar to see! Rico Pena and his pretty wife was there swaying to the beat of the music. Jehan Machacon, our respectable class president, was bumping and grinding with Awesh Shreshta and James Tagorda. Even Joao Manikan, still wearing his polo barong, was there. Our buddy Rahul Singh was applauded by the crowd when the Indian sounding club tune was played and he was dancing on the ledge. Sriram Krishnamachari got lost somewhere but I found him amongst the crowd dancing too. Al and Liezl followed too. As for myself, I got hungry and tired and left a little bit early. It was nice seeing everybody. It was really a day for celebration because we just got our grades and we're now full-fledged seniors!  Hooray for the batch! Congrats to all and especially for those who just took their CFA exam. Next weekend I hear there's another get together, this time in Halo in Makati. Hope to see you all there!

      If Tini has his basketball...I have my CSI. I'm a CSI junkie. Whether it's Miami or Las Vegas (and hopefully New York), I try to watch every episode. My favorite though, is Las Vegas. I dunno, I just like Gil Grissom's personality better than Horatio Caine. It's wednesday right now and I have my CSI appetizer on Studio 23...later, the main course on AXN. I also watch the double episode every mondays. My fascination doesn't stop there. Every friday and saturday I watch Crime Night on Discovery Channel. Although it's not as dramatic as CSI it's still fun to watch. I'm just a sucker for mysteries.   I have to watch CSI as much as I can before school starts again.

       I'm proud to say that today is our  6th year anniversary . Although we did not come this far unscathed, we continue to take each others' crap and love each other to death! Ours is not a fairytale romance but still deserving to be featured in television.  Tini  was after all, my brother's Math teacher. Our courtship was short, about two weeks. I say   "our courtship"   because if I hadn't been a bitch about it, he would've taken even longer! Despite the short courtship, we still lasted this long. Pretty impressive huh?!     &nbsp;   So  Tini , here's to our 6th year! Next year may we surpass the  itch  and hopefully get  hitched ! You're the only man who&nbsp;can stand a bitch like me. And I'm the only girl who can stand a brat like you! I love you so much baber!!! Muah!

       Thanks to my practicum I realized I'd rather put up a business for my thesis (we call it MRR here) than work&nbsp;for a company. My personality cannot handle being ordered around anymore. I wanna be my own boss and reap the profits (or loss...) that I rightfully deserve!     &nbsp;   I've been thinking of putting up a business connected to my core competency...which is  fashion . I'm lucky my roomies and I share the same passion. We all would like to be partners someday and create a  fashion empire .&nbsp;I can imagine&nbsp;walking down the runway with my three other friends&nbsp;in our&nbsp; uber  fashionable clothes! Well, were starting small with pajamas. This is actually Tin-tin's&nbsp;(my roomie)&nbsp;baby since she's been doing it for awhile. She had one made for me for my last birthday. We hope to conquer the jammy world!     &nbsp;   I almost backed out going through with this but thanks to our entrepreneurship mentor really pushed me to pursue this. This is my first step to being an entrepreneur and a fashion mogul!&nbsp;

      There should be a Shopaholics Anonymous here. Then me and my roomies would be in it. I don't know if our impeccable fashion sense is a curse or a gift because it can be very difficult resisting our urges to shop. Just this week (our first week back in school) we went shopping last monday at our favorite   tiangge   store, Trix, in Geenbelt 1. We justified our shopping spree by saying we needed new clothes for school. Yesterday, we went again to Greenbelt. Our intention was to go to Mr. Quickie to have our indian shoes (pasalubong from our good friend Kris) resized. We ended up shopping at the bazaar on the 2nd floor. This time we used the excuse that we got our stuff REALLY cheap because it was a sale. I ended up buying this cool brown suede Puma shoes. Believe me, it's really nice! This matches well with my khaki mini skirt and my Esprit tennis skirt too! Okay...I digress...where was I? Oh yeah! So, in the afternoon, I went to Glorietta to look for a possible skirt for our Cubs' Night Party for the new students. Alisa (one of my roomies) told me about the sale at Tweeds. I go there and sale was over! I was suppose to give up when I happen to pass by Mango. Their sale was still on. I already looked at their stuff in Rockwell and I didn't fit in most of the clothes so I gave up. I wasn't really going to buy anything when I say this awesome brown asymmetrical skirt! It clinged to my hips so well...it'll look good while I dance the night away...so I ended up buying it.  Now, I have to have a firm resolve that I will not shop for the next...few weeks(?). Well, probably till end of July...

      For the third year, Ateneo has broken DLSU's record. 2002, we became champions after their running streak of...was it four years? Then last year, Ateneo beat DLSU making them lose their seat in the championship. Last sunday, Ateneo broke DLSU's sixteen year record of not losing in the opening game. How cool was that?!  I was suppose to move in back to the dorm but I stayed home instead to watch the game. I was disappointed in the first three quarters and almost left for AIM but decided to finish it since my mom wanted me to stay for the night anyway. Well...good thing I stayed coz it was a game I'm glad I didn't miss! The Blue Eagles overcame a fifteen point lead!   I wish I was in Araneta singing the Hymn along with thousands of others. Or at least with some friends watching it while drinking beer and eating pizza. Tini had his own basketball game with his officemates. I just kept on texting him whenever something significant happened.  I hope we break more records. I hope we reach championship again. I hope I get to watch the next game live. I already bought two blue blouses for it!

      In the next few months, my roomie and I will be entering a new territory. We will be putting up our own business. There has been a few changes since my last posting. My new partner will be Tin-tin instead of Alisa. Our venture will be on garments instead of food. To our knowledge, this concept has never been done in AIM history. One of our guru, Prof. Jay Bernardo, has continuously been pushing us not to lose hope since there are many things needed to be done and it can be very overwhelming. Nonetheless, we are excited about our new business. I cannot disclose yet the nature of our business, suffice it to say it will bring happiness to dreary places.  I am on my way to be a millionaire.    "See what no one else sees. See what everyone chooses not to see... out of fear, conformity or laziness.
