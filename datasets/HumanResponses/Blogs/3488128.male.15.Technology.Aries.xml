      Everyone changes weither its good or bad, everyone goes through a dramitcic change.   I change and i realized i don't like change. I lost all of my good friends over a stupid fight and now we want 2 kick each others ass. I also woke up a little, grew a little, I realized tht my life itsn't tht best barbie doll life around. I realized how family reall treat you, who are your true friends, and i must admit i still don't know how they are.   The there are good thing tht come out of bad things: like i spent more time with katelyn than i do at my house and she got me 2 like the things she likes. Like for instance; writting a journal. expressing my feelings, doing blogger, listening to dashboard confessionals (i love them now)and so many other things. I'm glad i'm in high school and so i can go meat new kids and make new friends  I love you mike s. you helped me alot and i love you. Good luck on baseball and i go to all of your games defintatley.   Peace  Noreen

      Last nite I was a mess. I was pissed at everyone because of my stupid boss. She is a bitch. I don't like her and she dosen't like me. She goes out to have a cigarrette and talks about me. She talks about how I don't wasn't doing my job right. I think tht if she has shit 2 say the says it but not like "What does noreen do from the time she gets her until the time she leaves...she better start doing her job and stop bullshitting around" I don't care who u are u don't tlk 2 ur workers like tht because once i go to ireland this summer i an't coming back. Let the grl take my job perminatley because i don't care because she can her herself and everyone else there.  Today i'm not goimg in so i won't be this bad tonite.  lol  peace
