      wah, looks like the Li Jia Wei game is really talk of the town today. Was at Toa Payoh Stadium working, next to STTA lor! Wah lau, can hear people screaming one leh.. A pity she lose the game of course, but I think to sportsmen and sportwomen, losing the medals is not the most important thing. The most important thing not to lose is their fighting spirit and the killer instinct. I think in this Olympics, Singapore athelete all put on their best show, and that is the best answer they can give to themselves and the supporting countrymen!  Well, another sports in my life now. Guess what!! Huh, what you say?? Netball?? Yahyah, so correct!! Hai, sorry People, I so long never show face liao... flooded with balls in my life and figures (From school).  Trying to type as fast as I can also, strain a muscle during play and today a nerve from work today. Both on the same hand... Argh! But then, finally my Netball Super League is coming to an end next week. Haha, ALL are welcome to come watch the game on 28 August 2004, 7.30pm @ Toa Payoh Sports Hall! Its going to exciting... and it would mark a break for me!!!!!  See ya guys around in September!!!!

      Keke...had my 1st piano lesson @ Joyce's house today.   'Auntie Joyce' (KW's bro called her this, so i am following...keke) is a good teacher. Found the session fruitful as the objective set was met. Had a taste to Joyce's father cooking, and it is "wen ru qi ming"...meaning its delicious!

       The olympics has started more than a week.. and i have been chasing them.. really like watching sports , all kinds, swimming, soccer, gymnastics, table tennis blah blah blah...ha but i m a player of none..  juz watched the semi final between singapore li jiawei and north korea gal.. we lost.. Argh.. it was really so close, we were 3 games to 1, juz one more game and tt's it.. off to the finals.. but in the end the score was 4 games to 3 .. the last game was painful to watch.. the pts were to and fro, u nv noe who will win it.. it was so heart wrenching watching the final score being 11-9..  Many pple feel that even if she win, also not true blue singaporean, etc, and rave bout the money she will get.. i feel otherwise, i truly accept her as a singaporean.. wateva reasons she chose to play 4 singapore, she is wearing the national colours of singapore, we claimed that we depend on foreign talents then no typical sporean will wan to pursue a career as a sportsman.. anyway, she has been here for years, being trained here as well.. i believe that it's her passion to win as well, maybe the burden was simply too great for her..  it's such a diff feeling watching other races where u maybe haf a favourite player or country or so ..  but when u r watching ur own country, whether they played well or badly, u juz wan a win and tt's it, my heart was beating really fast as i watched the korean gal fight back, it's very sad.... i do want her to go into e final becos spore is assured of a medal whether anot she win or lose in the final.. in fact i dreamt hearing our national anthem played .. it's ll be a dream wic i believed someday be a reality and i do hope tt day come in front of my eyes.. but i still prayed and wished for the best that our national flag be displayed on the podium tomorrow.. i m proud to be a singaporean !! let's hope for the best to happen.... sorry to bore u guys esp if u r still reading till now.. jia you singapore :)

      Welcome to the first caregroup blog (in the world?)!! Ok, at least a first in USM! I'm certain of that. heeee*  This blog's skin was chosen mainly because of the lighthouse picture in the background. Doesn't it look great? Ok, we probably have different views on this. Let me say something you all will agree: Importantly, as a lighthouse provides light for vessels in the darkness, we aim to be one for people around us... and so the significance and decision of this. Ahem* =P Anyway, it's possible to change the background picture. We will edit as we build on this blog.   Hope all of us, the 13 usmoneans (Ant and I had a hard time getting the number right) will find this blog thingy an interesting, fun and meaninigful way to communicate and e-fellowship! =)
