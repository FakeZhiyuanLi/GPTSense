      I don't know why people believe in fate, its mere luck. The luck that you woke up that 1 minute to late and met miss perfect on the bus of all places. The luck that your got a flat tire and Mr. Perfect actually pulled over for you. Fate is the fact that you lost your job,  so  it must have been fate, besides you hated that job ,right. Fate is your boss telling you that to stay after work and on the way to your little (piece of shit apt.) you find miss perfect asking you for directions. So you could look at it from any perspective you want, fate and luck are very much alike. I belief in the mere fact that if is going to happen then it will happen,and you can't change it. There was a movie that came out not to long ago that was about brilliant scientist that lost his wife right before his very eyes. So he constructed a Time machine. Every time that he went back to try and save her, she died. Later he realized that he could not save her no matter the what he did. This is fate.                                                    P.S. Thanks "le ducth"                                                   I do believe in fate

      I can remember the first time that I went to a movie........................... It was a warm night in the borrows of Havana, we were going to the movie theaters and we were going to see some action flick. As I sat there hopelessly engaged on the screen. I fell captivated, almost compelled to watch movies. But it would be almost a decade before the little cuban kid to sit down in front of a 20 foot screen with Dobly Surround Sound. Well I just finished watching Spider Man 2, and it was worth every penny. Me being somewhat of a sound freak, actually  liked  the sound( love  is just a strong word, and no I don't have any problems with commitment).Even if the cinematic of the movie is breath taking, it will sink  period . In other words, if you don't have good sound then you ain't got (pardon the French) jack-shit.

      To belief in fate is to put your whole being into trust, but if you have ever gotten one of these: "You have just been PIMP KISSED! Tonight at midnight your true love will realize they like you. something good will happen to you at 1:00-4:00 pm tommorow, it could be anywere.Get ready for the biggest shock in your life. if you break this chain u will be cursed with realtionship problems for the next 10yrs. Send this to 15people in 15min"   Does this still count as fate.................nah just bad luck. NOW HURRY PASS THIS TO SOMEONE ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      I don't know why people care so much rather I move or not.   "You win some you lose some". Some quote just don't know who was the first to actually said it first, doesn't matter. Well who ever said it, I thank him for it. That's life.... Its a shame that life has to suck so much though.   Okay.................I won't move, I'll figure something out. Beside i couldn't leave my grandparents( ) nor my friends.                                          P.S.                                     Did i really say that............

      Its strange to think, ot actually think about how big the universe is. Seriously, just take 30 seconds to think about the "vastness of space", and then think about the size of the earth and scale to any other planet. We are reltivly small and new. It just "boggoling" to even think. I personlly love astronomy and would love to persue it as a career, but you don't really care, and its okay.                                                   P.S.                                         "Boggoling" don't know if it is a word or not.                                If any of you know what the tittle is then congrat to you.

      I dont really think that anyone actually moves away or dies. Let me explain before any shit goes down. When you get to know someone, you know them for WHO they are, for WHAT they are. So in a sense they never leave, (this is going to sound like a corny line from some Lifetime movie) they are always with you.  Or in other words, no don't think I am moving yet.................Jacksonville seems nice!

      If you know the significance of this phrase then you are truly a friend of mine. There are not many people that I have told this to. So this to you...........  The day is done, and the darkness Falls from the wings of night, As a feather is wafted downward From an angel in his flight.  weird I know, I am still trying to solve this one. Some what random, I think.                                                               P.S.                                    I got my own ideas                           But if you have some please share them

      If you have ever loved someone or not, I suggest that you......YES you, listen to your heart. This might seem like a line from a chick flick, but chick flicks always have a happy ending. And try to listen to see if you truly do love this person......and if your answer is "yes" then make it your obligation to tell her and don't let her get away.

      If you have ever been in love then you would know that it can be a b*tch. You wonder why do you the "nice" guy never gets the girl, and the "bad-ass" always gets the chick. But if you wait............then you never know. You might just turn ot to be the "bad-ass". But I am afriad that in this world thats never going to happen.Then again being the "nice-guy" never hurts.

      It suxs having to buy your own car, but doable. Oh, any of you out there should use  urlLink suprnova.org . Its like Kazaa but no pop-ups and there no instaling of anything. To explain how it works would be ludacris, to say the least it uses Torrent files. So random it could be a Family Guy commercial. From talking about having to buy your own car to a "Kazaa system thing". &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.S.

      Everything seems to be so significant as so make your way outside. The sun is blistering and you feel like pancake done by some guy named Rick with a plumbers crack. Then you realize that you are at work, and you are pushing carts for $5.50. You notice the plastic bags in the cart are like a yellow haven for heat. The customer is being a bitch and you have to put up with it. So you push the cart to the car and unload the packages.&nbsp;The guy looks at&nbsp;and ...........and...and, he says thanks and tips you 3 bucks. Wow life kicks ass.................... then you walk back in and as you start to work you just think about what to do with the green cash. Thongs, Cars, Overpriced Digital Clocks, or a Supra MK3.&nbsp;The thought of cash makes&nbsp;you think of all the free stuff that you have gotten thru out your&nbsp;life.................for&nbsp; me it has been an American Airlines Headphone set that is mad&nbsp;from Styrofoam. (Cheap Shit&nbsp;Suxs, reality is a&nbsp;cold pill named "Bitch") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.S.&nbsp; Being a Cashier is the easiest  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;job ever, just stand there and  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;push buttons.

      If chicks were as easy to understand as guys then there would be no need for therapy (WTF), or in other words the world would be so much easier. If they ask about their weight then there is  NO  answer that is correct. So I made up an answer that should help with those six words,  "Does this make me look FAT?".      Follow the steps:    1.) Don't answer right away or she might think that your just saying shit    2.)Ask her to turn and say the following "no".    3.)She will immediately deny and you must say "no" fast but strong    4.)You are now safe but your going to have to sit for another 2-5 hours. Shoes are another concept entirely.                                                                                               P.S. This is of course not foolproof like                                                     many things in life, but it works                                                      3/4 of the time. Oh ,but do remember                                                     that this is just B.S.

      The peacemaker, renowned by legends as the maker of great civilizations and a great cheesecake(to "le dutch" ChEeSeCaKe KICKS ASS).But its not everyday that........ screw it, there's no reason for such a thing as a peacemaker. The world needs to be(I cant believe that I am going to say this) unified. But yet separated, like if the U.N should take over but of course America kicks ass. This was all inspired by the movie Peacemaker..................hahahaha. LIVE ON "HIPEYS with your PIPES of PEACE". The two best things that came out of the 60's were hipeys and the other is the "Beetles".                                                 P.S. I feel so free man. Like an eagle                                                  man. Feel the wind. Take your clothes                                                  off and be free man, BE FREE(damm                                                  hipeys)

      "What a fucked up world this has become, music is my only release." Famous words once said by a bored individual, summers seems bleak and uneventfully. I would like to thank god for music.(If you ever win an award, make sure to follow the trend and thank god, everyone does it.) The tely(T.V) isn't that bad, and I have been watching a lot of rugby, working out, and reading(there's not much to do). Oh yeah the Vicious Cycle is everyday life.                                                           P.S.                                                    Live life one day at a time and                                                    hot milk and cookies kick ass.

      The one and only "New Zealand All Blacks", the greatest if not the best rugby team in the world. YAEAHHHHHHH, anyone that's anyone(repetitive) you definitely check them out. Look of Fox Sports, but the only one thing is that the games are "life air" and they play in England or New Zealand so the game are like at 1:00 a.m. in the morning. NO BIGGIE. You must check this out. You should write it down on that list that you have that says at the top," Things to do Before I Die". Put it as number 27, right after "Burn my Boss's $50,000 Car" and before "Cliff Diving at Buenos Aires,Brazil". But seriously this is the ultimate sport, right up there with Futbol.                                                    P.S.                                                  There not pronounced the "All Blacks"                                               more like "oll blaa-ks" and check out                                               website, "www.allblacks.com"
