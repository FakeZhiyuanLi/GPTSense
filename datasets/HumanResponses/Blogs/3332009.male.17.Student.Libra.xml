Put a face and some cute lips, earing and a tongue and she'll know what to do wit it. Make a name for herself, and she do her shit well, and know how to keep her business to herself. Come over anytime a nigga call chick, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, (ding dong) and she right there. And she know why she came here, and she know where her clothes suppose to be (off and over there). Sniff a little coke, take a little x, smoke a little weed, drink a little bit. I need a girl that I can freak wit, and wanna try shit, and ain't scared of a big dick.

Go on ahead so I dont have to do that far, I'm spoiled (and I don't like to work that hard). I like to lay back, relax, and enjoy my time, and let your eyes roll back and my toes curl.  (I love when you do that girl) Until it comes time for me to have to give her hers. Tell me what you want, do you want it missionary with your feet cramed into the head board? Do you want it from the back with your face in the pillow so you can  yell it loud if you want to? Do you want it on the floor? Do you want it on the chair? Do you want it over here? Do you want it over there? Do you want it in ya pussy? Do you want it in ya ass? I'll give you anything you can handle!  [Chorus]  [Bridge]  [Caller:] Yeah, I appreciate it lil' home boy.

      I dont know why I feel so tired the past few days. I think I have been  playing so much soccer, going to the gym and jogging. I feel crams all over my body now. I have never felt like this for a very long time since secondary school days. But I need to exercise to keep myself in shape. I have notice some progess. I trying to get that six pack. I know its difficult but nothing is impossible.  Got back my semester 2 results. Not too happy with it though. I got four B's , one C  and two D. I am happy that I pass all but I know i should have done better. What is done is done? I should now look forward to year 2 with higher expectations and goals.

      I went for a job interview with my frens on monday at Apex Tower.They say they were looking for part-timers in admin and the sales department. I filled up a form with all my personal particulars and later went to see the manager. The manager say that he will call us back.He was quite a nice guy He did call us on the following day. Today, i went for a briefing. I did not really like the job they were offering us. My frens and I rejected the job. Later we went to raffles city to eat at subway. It was already 7 plus. Subway is the best fast food restaurant. It is even better than Mc Donalds and KFC. The food is also healthy but i bit expensive. Singapore should open more branches. Later made our way to Far East Plaza to look at clothes. I wish I got money. I really want a job.

      I went to Malacca with my parents on the 20th of May. The reason we went there was for the annual Barsi of Sant Sohan Singh. People from all over Singapore and Malaysia came for this event. My father decided to drive up. It was the first time that we drove up to Malacca. It is because usually we take the bus.   We left around 1 and arrived at Malacca  around 5 plus. My uncle and cousins also followed us in a different car. Driving along the highway in Malaysia is very nice experience. Seeing all the beautiful scenery-the mountains, large plantaions and forested area. We stopped over about twice. It is because we dont get to see much natural beauty in Singapore  Once, we arrived in Malacca we checked into the hotel that my uncle had booked about month ago. We went to temple later. The next morning, we went to the temple early in the morning. Alot of pilgrims were already in the temple. Slowly, alot of people filled up the temple. People keep on leaving and coming. This event is spread over three days. All of a  sudden it started to rain like cats and dogs. It created a bit of havoc outside the temple. It rained for about two hours. Then, suddenly it became so hot. The weather was even hotter in Singapore. About 37 degrees. Thats damm hot. Can feel your feet burning? We went window shopping at night. Some things in Malaysia are quite expensive especially the branded stuffz. Only the food is cheap and good. The roti john damm shock. The popiah even better. The chendol the best. One of the best chendol i ever tasted.  On the final day, we went to temple for one final time. Said our prayers and went back to the hotel to pack our stuffz and put our stuffz in the car. We relaxed in one of my uncle's room who was leaving on sunday. We left Malacca around 5. Along the way on the highway leading to Singapore, my uncle's car stalled. We were all very worried. His car was towed away to the nearest exit point which was Yong Peng,Johor.The car had to be repaired. My uncle told  my dad not to wait for him and to take his children along. We left him and his wife there to repair the car. We arrived at Singapore around 9.45pm  Overall, the trip was fun as i learned alot of things. I found out that Malaysian drivers are very daring. They like to change lanes,cut here and cut there. They are risk takers.

      What do u do when u love someone? You will tell them  your feelings. I did tell this girl from the same school as me that I admire her and I cant sleep at night without thinking about her. But I told via an email. I should have told her face to face. What an idiot? Whenever i see her in school, I just freeze. I try to smile at her but it seems that she did not notice me. My love life is just crap. No one will ever like  me. I used to like another girl who was in the same Punjabi school as me but she has now migrated to Australia. What a waste? It is time to move on.  Anyway, today i went to look for a job with a fren of mine. Monday must go for interview. Damm scary. I will be going to Malaysia(Malacca) tommorrow for a religious program. I will be back on Saturday.

      I went to SIR to extend my passport. Waited for almost an hour before my turn . But it was ok. My passport was extended for a year. Later, my dad drove me to Arab Street to eat Nasi Briyani. Long time never eat nasi briyani. It was a nice meal. I talked to my father about our trip on this coming thursday . I usually dont talk much to my dad. I usually answer the questions that he ask me. But he is still my dad and I will always love him.   I will going to Malacca with my parents on Thursday. It is great time to get closer to them.Bonding time Went to gym in the evening with my fren. I think I really had a good workout. Running on tread mills, carrying weights and so on. I feel quite tired now.

      It was not a very  good weekend. My computer kept on giving me problems.I had to keep on restarting my computer. It is driving me nuts. Though i have some how solve the problem, I am still not very happy with my computer. I am trying to find a job but very difficult to find one. I am so choosy. I always one the perfect job. I must find a job. Because staying at home is so boring. I did went to search for a job. I went to Royal Sporting House. They say they only looking for people after 15th June. I wanted to work at a petrol station but my mum never allow me. She say no good to breathe in all the gas. Almost fought with her.I must learn how to control myself. I get worked out very easily. I must overcome this barrier.  The only positive sign for me over the weekend was witnessing Arsenal complete an entire EPL season without a single defeat. WOAH! What an achievement? They also lifted the trophy. That was the most pleasing sight ever. I am proud to be a Gunner. Gunner forever.

      My day started off badly. I was awoken by a loud sound and it was only 8.30 in the morning. The loud sound was actually an alarm of someone's car. The alarm not only woke me up but the entire neighbourhood. I had no choice but to wake up. I did my daily routine and i ponder what to do for the rest of the day. I decided to clear my cupboard. While cleaning my cupboard, I saw my passport and decided to look at it. To my shockness, my passport had expired three months ago. I totally forgot to renew my passport. I will be going to Malaysia next week. I thank my lucky stars and my curiosity to clean my cupboard that i found out this. What if i did not realise that my passport had expired? Why must Singapore boys waiting to serve NS need to renew their passport every 6months? Total waste of time. I think the govt very scared and they have no fate in us not serving our NS and running away from Singapore.Talking about NS, i need to start preparing myself although it is two years away. I went jogging in the evening to practice 2.4km.   In the whole, nothing interesting happen except for that almost dreadful mistake.

      I mean i am talking about Arsenal's 37 match unbeaten run. No team ever since, Preston North End in 1889 has ever gone the whole season unbeaten. If Arsenal,draw or win their last game at home. They will be creating history. I know it might sound irritating to some but Arsenal are truly amazing. In my eyes,they are the best. No matter what, I will always support them. Today was freaking boring day. I stayed at home and rot.  Nothing interesting happen. Life is so boring when your sis is not in Singapore. Why did she have to go to Australia? I just read the newspaper and watched some movies i rented. There is alot of strange things happening in the world.By the way the weather is so bloody hot. The weather is so funny that it keep on changing. One week it rains non-stop, the next week it is so hot. It is making me sick.Trust me guys, in the next few days it will rain.

      The exams are over. Phew! What a relief? Now must wait for the results. The last three days has been quite tiring. On monday,played soccer with some ex-secondary school mates. Later a group of malay guys joined us. I hate playing with madz. They like to act. They think they so good. Anyway, one of frens made a fair tackle on one of our malay opponents. That guy a really good actor. He wanted to picked a fight with us. I being the peacemaker of the group decided to cool things down. On the whole , we played three games and lost two and draw one. I was quite happy with my performance because i scored five goals. The next day, I went to watch Van Helsing. It was not too bad. The sound effects and the action was good but the movie was short. On wednesday,I slacked around at home. Using my computer, playing games and so on and so for. I also spent time cleaning my room and thinking what to do for the rest of the holidays.I hope the next six weeks of the holidays will be more exciting especially with Euro 2004 coming up.

      My sis is coming back from Perth,Down Under tomorrow. Although I am not so happy with the idea of her coming back because I have less freedom and privacy now that she is coming back. Meaning less time on the computer.But she is still my sister. Life at home has been so boring without you. It has been four months since I last saw my sis. Phew! Time passes by very fast. I still can remember the day i sent her off at the airport. As if it was yesterday.  Anyway today is my sister's birthday. How ironic rite?  Happy birthday sis.

      I slept at 12 and woke up at 2.30 in the morning to watch Portugal vs England. So dramatic. Before the match started ,there was loud shouting. Some mad fool started shouting damm loudly. I looked out from my window and saw a couple arguing. They were shouting in mandarin so I didnt quite understand. The shouting ended after 15min. Just nice for the start of a roller coaster match. It was a really bumpy ride. Before I could even settle down, England scored after 2min. But after that England lost its shape as McRooney had to pull out. They were hardly attacking. Portugal punished them with a well deserved equaliser. England should have won the game in the dying seconds. Why on Earth was Sol Campbell's goal disallowed? I still cant understand. The match went into extra time. Portugal scored through Rui Costa. What a goal? A thunderbolt. Lampard equalise for England. The match went to penalties. Up step David Beckham, the most popular soccer player in the world but the least popular player in SANS world. He blasted his penalty over the bar. Did anyone tell Becks he was playing soccer and not rugby? He blamed the pitch. He should blame himself. He let the entire nation down.England went on to lose the penalty shootout. England's Euro 2004 dream go crashing. So close yet so far. Boy! This tournament is getting so exciting. I better go and catch some sleep. Later got France vs Greece. Adios

      --Perfect Stranger  I look at you from far away, To you, I am just a perfect stranger. Never would I be in your life  And share the joy and happiness You constantly carry with you. I would never be the one  You see when you close your eyes, Nor the girl you would ever pause To look at and say to yourself,  "God!  She is so beautiful!" I'd never be the person You'd pick up your pencil  And write love notes to Or send flowers on Valentine's Day. Because to you, I am a perfect stranger. But, what you are to me, you'll never know. You make up who I am. When I see you walking past me, I would pause and smell the scent You carry with you in the air? The scent that takes over my body And swallows up my soul. I always secretly look into your eyes And hope for the day when I will see my own reflection in them. When I pick up my pencil, I always end up finding myself Writing love poems about you? Poems I would never have  The courage to walk up to you And place them in your hands. Unlike all the other girls, I only see you once a day, Sometimes even not at all. So, for every time I find myself Anywhere near you, I am thankful for that moment. *Sigh* ...but why does it matter? Because, after all, I am still A perfect stranger.  ---Dream  I lie awake, alone in my bed,  awaiting your gentle touch,  Thinking of all I should have said,  'Cause to me you mean so much.  If this be a dream, let me never wake,  For my heart you have stolen, and my breath you do take.

      Really really tired. I have been sleeping almost 5 in the morning ever since Euro 2004. But I have no regrets. I have been treated to world-class soccer of the highest quality. Rooney is really superb. He is only 18 and terrorising defence like nobody business. I am really happy that Thierry Henry finally scored. Euro 2004 is getting more and more exciting.  Away from soccer, I woke up at 12 noon  today, took a bath , ate my lunch and went to my room. I decided to clear my stuffs and my mind. I was shocked to find out that I have alot of shirts and pants that I have hardly wore before. I decided to give some of my small shirts away to the salvation army. Then,I sat down on my bed and started to think about my life.  Do I really have a pathetic life or is my life just ordinary? I think there are alot of wrong things in the past that I have done in my life which could have been prevented. I kept on thinking about how to improve myself. I know nobody in this world is perfect. I also thought about Felicia. I really miss her. It sounds crazy rite even though she dont really know me but I still miss her. Hope she will become part of my life. I found the Anthem of Our Dying Day by Story of the Year very interesting. It is a nice song.  Adios

      I am not feeling too well lately. I mean I am not sick as in sick. I am love sick. I really hope there will be someone by my side. I just dont know why I cant find myself a gf. I am too choosy I guess or maybe girls are blind. Neither am I ugly nor handsome. Why is it that girls dont seem to take interest in me? Currently I like this gal(FEL) at NYP(SIT) very much. I knew she was the one ever since my eyes got lost into her.  But I know she do not take particular interest in me. She might think I am some good for nothing tallie loser. My whole world seems to have changed. I am not the Sanjeev I used to be. Oh God, Whats the hell is happening to me? It is like everything I do, I will think about her. Even now while blogging I think about her. She has been like part of me. The first thing I think when I first wake up is her and the last thing I think is her. Whenever, I play soccer I also think about her. I am in love.   Deep down inside me , I will always love you.

      Strange title rite. It happen to me last nite while I was watching Euro. It was abt 3 in the morning. I went to the kitchen and saw this flying cockroach. It was flying all over the kitchen. Finally it stopped flying and  I quickly took the kitchen board and whack it. Cockroaches are just so damm irritating. The worse was about to come. I went back to my hall and sat down on the sofa. A hornet flew in. I was so scared. I picked up my courage and told myself if I can kill a cockroach, than I can kill this stupid hornet. But this hornet is one smart creature. It was always fooling me. Finally, I managed to kill it. During the match, my so called pet in my house kept on irritating the hell out of me. I am talking about lizards. Lizards tend to be very active late at nite. It kept on moving acoss my ceiling. I thought it was  going to drop. The insects and lizards really distracted me from watching the game.  My fren called me up today and told me that he had two free tickets for the Linkin Park concert. But he told me later that I must pay $30 for it. I told him forget it. Besides I dont really like Linkin park. They are really not my cup of tea. Hoobastank rulz.

      Euro 2004 has started and my sleep has been slightly affected. But who cares. I have been treated to some breath taking soccer and surprises. Portugal losing and France scoring two goals in second half injury time to win the game. I still cannot believe it. I had already accepted my fate that France is going to lose the game and how the media will be going about France failure to win but sometimes miracles do happen.It is not over until it is over.   I almost burnt my kitchen down. choy! But really. I was making some hotdogs in the oven. It was during the France and England game. I set the oven to ten minutes to cook the hotdogs. I went to watch the match. I totally forgot to go and check the hotdogs.  After about 20min, I smelled something burning. I said, "OH! sHIT" to myself. The hotdogs were totally burnt. What rotten luck? I was so hungry that I just I ate bread. After throwing the hotdog away, I went back to the hall to watch the game. I should be more aware of things like that. I cant blame myself as I was totally engrossed in the game. But in the end I was smiling as France won. This is only the beginning.

      My top five current songs: 1)The Reason-Hoobastank 2)Are You Going To Be My Girl? - Jet 3)I Dont wanna know - Mario Winans ft P.diddy 4)Breathe Easy - Blue 5)Last Train Home - Lost Prophets  I just love all these songs. I hear them almost everyday. There are too many bands nowdays. There is a new band named Keane. They sound almost like Coldplay. Both are British bands. Moving away from songs but staying with music by my irritating yet nice loving neighbours  My neighbours are slowly and surely irritating the hell out of me.Why?  My neighbours are part time musicians and full time housing agents. More like the other way round. They have all the musical instruments in their house from drums to guitar to piano. So whats wrong with having musical instruments. nothing wrong rite. But they play it almost everyday and they also sing. They do this all very loudly in a HDB flat. Worse of all, their friends and relatives will come over and sing along with them. Almost every night is like Christmas carol night. My mother always say there they go again. This morning I plan to wake up at ard 12 but I could not. I was awaken by loud drumming and singing.It was only nine and i slept at 4. I dont mind all this singing and drumming. But there is a limit to everything. Anyway my neighbours are actually quite nice people. I must try to get used to their music playing everyday. It is going to be part of my life.

      I went to Orchard with some of my frens. We wanted to watch Shrek 2. But unfortunately the tickets were sold out. Woa so popular.We spent almost five minutes deciding what to do. We finally decided to watch Harry Potter. The movie was to start at 6.15. It was only 5.30 so we decided to eat. We ate at Long John Silver. The movie was nice but confusing. U need to read the book to understand better.It was also quite funny and Emma Watson is damm hot. She is only 14 but she is so beautiful. Of course not so beautiful as someone I like very much.  Enough of that. After the movie went to Heeren. My fren wanted to buy a cd. We look around HMV for unknown artist and new cds.I just love going to HMV. We came across this  band called the New Found Glory. Their music is ROCKING GOOD. I downloading their music now. Gtg now.

      It was because I was not feeling well. I think all the straining exercise has finally come down hard on me. I felt pain all over my body and I had a spilting headache. It lasted all morning. I could  not go out and play soccer with my buddies. Instead I stayed at home all day and looked at the four walls around me. Just joking. I rested and I felt slightly better at night.   At night I downloaded I dont Wan u back music video by Eamon. The video was quite nice. I have been hearing the song but I have not seen the video. Somehow Mtv does not show it. maybe they do when i am not watching tv. Talking about TV, i am going to watch France vs Ukraine match now on CH5. My favourite national team.  Ciaoz.

      Today I played soccer with some of my secondary school frens. It has been a few months since we last played. We all met at a street soccer court near Loo Twang's house at around 11. When we arrived there, we noticed that the clouds was turning black and that it was going to rain. We had only played for 20 min when it started raining. We seek shelter under some flats. The rain started to reduce so we decided to continue playing as long as there was no lightning. From than on we played a few games until around 2.  I was quite please with my performance. I was the captain of my side. I scored a few beauties.  I felt quite tired and my backside is quite pain as i fell down. It was a quite funny incident. Such a tall guy like me falling down. Even Zul fell down. It was so funny the way he fell.   After that we all went to eat at AMK and I went home after that I spent the rest of my day listening to music and surfing the net. I keep on changing the songs in my mp3 player.

      I had enough of finding jobs. No luck at all. I went for three job interiews in the past two weeks. All three not successful . It is quite difficult to find a job for  just a month. Most of the jobs want at least two months the least and able to speak mandarin. How I am suppose to know mandarin? I am Indian.   I went to gym today. It was surprising quite packed. I suppose it is the school holidays. I went to have lunch with my buddies after that workout. I ate chicken chop. Shiok man! Thats unhealthy food. When I reached home at about 3, I found out that nobody was at home. I had the whole house to myself. I practised singing and dancing. I do have this talent in singing and dancing. I suppose I am to afraid to showcase my talent. Maybe I can be Singapore Idol if I had registered. In my dreams.  There is still one month before school restarts. Euro 2004 coming up. Looking forward to it.

      It was just a bad weekend for me. I let my team down. I let myself down. How could i have miss a chance like that? I am angry with myself. At home I had an arguement with my dad. He accused me for everything that goes wrong in the house. I was like so mad that i did not talk to him. What to say again, it simply the worse weekend in my life? I hope to get over&nbsp;&nbsp;the latest setback in my life . I have never felt so angry, sad all at once.

      So LONG NVR BLOG. Tired lah. No mood The first week of school was quite boring and boring. If not for my frens, school will be even more boring. The lecturers are so damm boring especially the Data Structure lecturer. She like lullaby. No kick. They make lectures all at the wrong timing. Nite lessons. When everyone is tired. The modules this semester looks quite tough. I must try my best to get through this semester without failing anything. So far my academic grades in poly is in the B and C  range. "Impossible is Nothing"

      Tomorrow is the start of a new semester in school. My second year in poly. Time passes by very fast. I can stil remember the day i was taking my '0' Level results. As if it was yesterday.I wonder how my life would have been if i had gone to JC. Total mess and stress,I guess. The sight of my JC frens really struggling to cope with the amount of pressure. I pity them. Why go through all the pain of studying GP,maths,chem and so on. I am glad I am in the poly. Life is not so stressful.  A new chapter in my life is about to begin. Wish me luck in my love life. ALL THE BEST IN WHATEVER I DO. DO NOT RUSH. THINK STRAIGHT AND I GOT A CHANCE.

      My sis is back. Everything is back to normal for me. I seemed to be inspired by Spiderman 2. It is just an awesome movie. I recommend those reading my blog to watch it. There will be no regrets at all. Life seems to be back to normal. I slowly and surely giving up my dream of getting the girl of my dreams. But there is always still a slim chance. I just want to lead a normal life that I enjoy so much. I must concentrate in whatever I do. School starting soon. The holidays is almost over. I want to recommend a song from Spiderman 2 soundtrack. It is from Train. The song title is Ordinary. Thats what I am.

      I am in a state of dilemma. Alot of my frens asking me to go for the Hoobastank concert . But the ticket is $75. Alot of $$$. One part of me is telling me to go and another part is telling me not to go. I wanna save $500 to buy Zen touch or Ipod. What should i do? Hoobastank simply rocks. Best rock band in the world
