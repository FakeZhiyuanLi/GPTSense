						    I have been so lazy the last couple of days and I am not sure why. My insomnia has returned and I have beenup until 2:00-3:00am, that may be playing a part. At least I don't have things scheduled that it is fouling up.     &nbsp;   Leah & I got the walls sanded in the bathroom on Saturday. I decided I want to replace the entire wall by Michaels sink. Its just been rigged too many times to get it to look nice so why not just get a piece of drywall and replace the whole thing. Today I am going to get the trim for the corners cut glued and hung. I am still planning on getting the painting dome this week.     &nbsp;   The boys went ot the Bike show in Carlisle this weekend. They had a blast and It was good for them to get out and bond a bit. They got back late though and missed church so just Leah & I went. We talked about Gideon. What a scardy cat he was but knowing God is on your side you can do anything.     &nbsp;   Um... I cant'think of much else to post. My stomach has been acting up as well here of late. Perhaps something (illness) is brewing and that's why I feel so off lately. Anyhow, that's all for now, CHOW     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

						    WOW, where did this week go?     &nbsp;  I am just about done with prepping in the bathroom.The walls should get painted next week if all goes well. I got my shower curtain and liners in the mail already, just waiting on the rod & hooks yet. The curatin is going to match nice with the shade I picked out for the cabinets. I got the wires for the light fixtures rerouted yesterday and just a little more spackling and sanding to do.    &nbsp;  Not much happening this week . The kids were here on Wednesday and basically we had time to eat and watch a little TV and it was time to take them back home. We had stopped at Daddy's to give him a haircut so that ran us late.     &nbsp;  Yesterday after Michael cam home we form work we went to the bank to make a deposit and then to the grocery store. Chef Boy pizza for supper with hamburger and extra cheese, YUMMY! We basically sat around and watch the tube like the typical couch potatos we are. I can't even tell you what we watch.     &nbsp;  Seems to me my life has been rather boring this week.&nbsp;Perhaps next week will bring an adventure of some sort. That's all, Later :)

						    Ok so I am off to a poor start in writing daily entries. Perhaps I should just focus on writing regularly instead of daily.     &nbsp;   Sunday we got up and went to church then over to Daddy's for the day. Old friends came down for a visit from Hazelton. I believe Daddy really enjoyed their company, I did too. We took them for a drive to see the tornado damage and then we went out for supper together.     &nbsp;   Yesterday I finally got that last coat of paint on the tiles in the bathroom, YEAH. When I am done here I am going to do some prepping on the walls to get them ready for painting. I also ordered the shower curtain, liner &amp; rod. I am going to wait for the curtain to come and match up paint with it to do the cabinets.     &nbsp;   I started an new bible study on prayer today. I think I only have two other lesson series&nbsp;before I have finished the entire program.&nbsp;I will have to seek out another web study so I can stay focused in the Word each day. It is so easy to slack off when&nbsp;I am&nbsp;not in a study of some sort.     &nbsp;   Well that's about it nothing to exciting happening this week. Until next time, CHOW :)

						    Today was our day of rest this week. We have done nothing but watch TV and prepare &amp; eat food, its&nbsp;been nice though. We slept in until 9:30 and have just enjoyed being in each other's presence today.     &nbsp;   Tomorrow we will get up early and go to church, then over to Campbelltown. Daddy is getting company from Hazelton, Donna &amp; George DePrisco. She was the daughter of one of daddy's best friends, Pete.     &nbsp;   We are also going to stop in at the fire hall and see what needs to be done. We decided to do it all tomorrow instead of making so many trips over there. Gas is so expensive and we seem to always be going over that way. Michael &amp; I agree we need to move back over to the Palmyra/Campbelltown area. I would like to move in with daddy and help him out around the house as well as keep him company until his life here is over. He has hinted around about it in conversation with Michael &amp; I but no serious talks yet.     &nbsp;   Well we are going to watch "Somethings Gotta Give" tonight. Last night was the Butterfly Effect. It was good. Sorta like a modern day It's a Wonderful Life. It makes you think though how your life can affect so many others lives, even with the simplest of choices you make.

						    Today seemed like a wasted day. I got up and went to the bank and the grocery store for a few things. Came home and paid a&nbsp;few bills.&nbsp; August can't get here soon enough, by then we should be caught up with finances.     &nbsp;   Chatted online to a nice young lady I met through Xanga and got 3 loads of wash done. I know, I was to finish the painting in the bathroom shower tiles but Oh well, I guess now it will be pushed off until Monday.&nbsp; Mustered up the energy to vacuum the house and do the dishes that were piling up. I need to get either Jerry's or Donna's carpet shampooer and do the carpets again.&nbsp; It sucks when you clean them and you don't notice much of a difference. Made supper and just sat around most of the day. Michael is running to go get movies to watch tonight, Butterfly Effect and As Good As It Gets. He said a woman he works with ran into an old co-worker of mine and said she has been trying to get in touch with me for months. I am going to try to get in touch with her next week.&nbsp;I haven't seen or talked to her in probably a year or more. She is really the only one out of a dozen that I worked with that I care to keep in touch with.     &nbsp;   I was filling the bird feeders today and discovered a dead rabbit in the garden :(&nbsp; I know it wasn't there yesterday when I was weeding and I saw no signs of trauma. I am wondering if it might have been poisoned or something, it looked kinda young.     &nbsp;   Tomorrow we are going to get up early and go over to Campbelltown and see what we can do to help out as far as volunteering at the fire hall. The clean up process is going slow and they are searching for pets that are out in the corn fields. They need people to help prepare meals for the homeless and workers too.

						   I spent the entire day outside catching up on yardwork. I weeded the garden which was way over due. I emptied 3 wheelbarrows of weeds into the woods. I also got the grass mowed in between all the rain we have been having. I dug up some Shasta daisies and a prime rose plus my Russian sage for Donna's memorial garden for mom. That was the most physical activity I have had in a while and my back is hurting!  &nbsp;  We went over to daddy's for supper and took a driving tour to look at the damage from the tornado that ripped through Campbelltown yesterday. It is devastating. I feel so bad for those who lost everything. We want to help but at this point we would just be in the way because they still have all the officials there sorting things out and the state police have the entire development blocked off. The National Weather Service determined that&nbsp;it was a&nbsp;F3 tornado that caused the damage. Based on structural damage, the National Weather Service estimated the winds to have been 175-200 mph.&nbsp;It was on the ground for 10 to 15 minutes, leaving a trail of destruction 7.5 miles long, &nbsp;leveling 37 homes, severely damaging 34 and leaving 78 others with less severe damage.&nbsp;Here is the address&nbsp;to the local news site that has pictures of the storm damage  urlLink http://www.thewgalchannel.com/index.html   &nbsp;  After supper we dropped off Donna's plants for her. She then informed me that I had to plant them. Just what I wanted to do after spending all day in my own bed!&nbsp;It was for mom though so of course I did. We dropped daddy back off and we went in and I payed his bills and played with Midnight a bit. I told him we would take her once we are done with all the remodeling. She would only get in the way now.  &nbsp;  Now we just got home and I am ready to call it a night. Perhaps tomorrow I can attempt to get those darn tiles painted!

						   I caulked the holes left from the shower door today. That is all I did remodeling wise. Tomorrow I plan on putting the last coat of paint on the tiles and then that portion of the bathroom is done. Then we will move on to painting the walls. I found a tension rod online today that will fit our stall and I am watching a sage & white gingham print shower curtain on eBay. I also found tandem hooks to hold the curtain and the liner. It's coming along slowly but surely.  I finally was able to sit down and finish my bible study lesson today. This was the first of the intermediate lessons and they take much longer to do than the other ones. I do like doing them though because it gets me in the routine of focusing in the Word of God each day. I have had quite a few people commenting on my other site that my posts bring them encouragement and that they enjoy reading them each day. It's funny how God works through people. I was tossing around whether I wanted to keep doing posts daily and then come the flow of encouragement for me! I love it when you recognize God speaking to you.  I went to pick up the kids for 12:45. Blake wanted to drive his car so I left mine up there and we went to Donna's to drop of some pictures from our sisters night the other week. Then the kids tried to talk her into going out for lunch but she was into working in the garden and didn't want to shower. I had no money so I told them if they wanted to eat out they would have to pay. Believe it or not they still wanted to go and so we went to Friendly's and the kids picked up the tab! It was great!  After Friendly's we stopped in with Daddy to pay some bills and then the storm hit. It came on quick and the wind really picked up but I really didn't think it was all that bad, at first. We lost power and then the fire sirens started going off. We waited it out for another half hour or so and then left to go home. We only got about 2 miles and had to turn back. There were trees and wires down every direction we tried to go. We got back to dad's and Donna called and said that a tornado touched down just outside of town. The kids just wanted to go back to their place because we couldn't make it to my house and everyone else was out of power. They live north of all the storm damage so they went home around 4. I tried to go back home again and finally made it but had to go almost 10 miles out of the way to get there. Donna, Mike & I were on the cell phones keeping each other updated as to what was going on. Till it was all said and done a whole development on the outskirts of town was wiped out. Twelve houses were completely leveled and most of the others had missing roofs & second floors. Nothing like that has ever happened in this area before,.It reminded me of damage you see in the Midwest from a tornado. We even made the Nightly News with Brian Williams!Last I heard there were about 100 or so displaced people. 16 were injured and only one of them seriously. That is amazing after looking at the damage. Thank God it happened mid day when most were still at work or it would have been much worse I am sure.  Michael is in the shower and I am on here playing around. I told him it was time to work on the facial hair. He was starting to get a bit wild looking. Well that was my exciting day now I am ready for a hot cup of joe and then to bed I go.

						   My day didn't start out all that great. I woke up to my phone ringing but I couldn't get anything to come up on the LED screen. I went online to AT&T and they said to take it to a local store. So then I had to run into town and explain to this guy what was happening. He played around with it and took out the battery and the SIM card and finally got it to work. Anyhow, Blake said he wants to buy a camera flip phone so I guess I am going to take his phone then. It is the one I wanted in the he first place but you can read about that episode in the last Friday's post, I think. After all that I tried to finish up my bible study lesson but I just couldn't concentrate on it so instead of just doing it with out my heart in it, I put it away for tomorrow or Thursday.  I got the second coat of paint on the shower stall. I think the paint will work on the tiles but they will need a third coat to look nice. Michael & I decided we are going to put up a curtain instead of another shower door. We think it will be a bit roomier and definitely cheaper. I can get a bit of color accent in the white room with the curtain too. The bathroom will be white ceilings, walls, tub, shower & sinks with the cabinets and shower curtain in a sage green. I found some nice wood cabinet pulls the replace the old ones with too. To finish it off we are putting in a faux tongue & groove plank floor. Then we will trim the whirlpool sides off with the flooring running vertical. It can't get done soon enough!  Our ducks came back tonight! Earlier in the spring we had a momma duck nest under a bush in our front yard. She sat on 14 eggs for 27 days. I took her a piece of bread each morning and eventually she all but ate out of my hand. Tonight the neighbor knocked on the door and there they were up on the porch with him! The duckling are now the size of their momma and had ferocious appetites. They went through a whole pack of hot dog buns and a half a loaf of bread!   Kurt stopped over for a visit and we sat and chatted for a while. Now Mike is watching Tuesday Night Fiights and I am on here trying to get done before the main event comes on.

						   Rain rain go away  come back some other day We want to go outside and play Come again some other day  Stayed in all day cause of the rain. I got the shower stalls first coat of paint on, the old light fixtures down and the paint removed from the trim in the livingroom. I'm not sure what to do about the lights in the bathroom. The new fixtures will have to go about 6" lower to accommodate the drop ceiling and I will need to patch the hole left from the old fixture. I might just have Dick come over and figure it out. I can easily get the new fixtures up on my own. I have basic electrical experience but I am no drywaller.  I was working on the plants just as Michael was getting home. I have these vines that were given as a gift jeez, like 10 years ago and every couple of years I take them and untangle, get rid of the long stems with no leaves and such. It takes a while to do and my shoulders get sore cause I have to keep it hanging so I don't damage the vines. Some strands are 8' long!  Michael & I sat and chatted about our days and made leftovers for supper as we watched Oprah & the news. Then he want to get tobacco and I played on here a bit.  We both got our showers early and watched a Jeff Foxworthy show on Comedy Central. He's pretty funny , and there were three other guys with him too. One was Larry the Cable Guy.  I plan on getting the second coat on the shower tomorrow and if my check comes go get the paint for the cabinets. Well, g'nite, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite!

						   I am tired so I will make it a short entry.   Lazy day today with the kids. We all slept in till close to noon and then Leah & I went to the grocery store.  We bought the ingredients we needed to make lasagne. Got home  & got it started. Amy came over after work and we eat around the dinner table which was a nice change from sitting in front of the TV.  After dinner we all watch Alice in Wonderland. It must have been 20 years since I saw it in its entirety. The catipillar is still my favorite character.  Did a few loads of wash and took it easy the rest of the night. I have a back ache from my period and kinds felt blah most of the day. We watched another movie on HBO later then "The Weight of Water." It was good. Sean Penn was in it with Elizabeth Hurley. They were investigating a murder that took place over 100 years ago in New Hampshire and I believe it was based off of a true story, well, the murder aspect was anyway. Now it's close to midnight and I am going to bed, G'night!

						   I had a good relaxing day today. We had a lazy morning just sitting around sipping coffee and waking up slowly.   Amy brought Blake & Leah up around 12:30 and we got a game of 500 rummy started. It wasn't my day for winning at cards, I just couldn't seem to stay focused on the game for some reason.  Daddy stopped over and brought Midnight along to see how the cats would react to her. Midnight just wanted to play and be friendly but the cats wanted nothing to do with her. They didn't totally freak though , so now I just have to convince Michael that we should take her in. I wish daddy would just keep her cause I know she is good company for him but if he is going to insist on getting rid of her then I would rather have her than take the chance of her going to a home that wouldn't love her.  We had chicken fingers and french fries for supper then we got ready and went to church. Donna brought Michael's mom along, that was nice. We started a new sermon series tonight and it was just what maw needed to hear. Basically that our character is built on how we respond to circumstances in our lives and that God is always with us even through those troublesome times.  Now we are home and getting ready to sit down together and watch a movie but I have no idea what we are going o watch. I am on here typing away and Michael and Leah are watching Law & Order SVU. Blake is in the bathroom with the wild idea that he is going to shave his body hair off. I can't wait for a few days to go by and see how he likes it as it starts growing back and is all itchy! You live & learn!

						   It's was a long day. I got up around 8:00am and had my coffee and quiet time then got started on the bathroom, again. I sanded off the excess caulk from the mess I made yesterday. Now we a re ready to start painting.  Mike came home early from work due to a full warehouse. I finished up what I was doing, took a shower then we were off for the day.  First we went to Lowes to get the light fixtures and cabinet pulls for the bathroom. Then we went over to the mall to get our phones and plan straightened out. What a mess. They told us on Wednesday to come back today because they ran out of the phones that go with the special we were purchasing. Blake took the last one on Wednesday. Well, we get there and they tell us that they are no longer carrying that model, it has been discontinued. Now you can't tell me that they didn't know this two days earlier! Needless to say the pickings we had to choose from were slim but we ended up with a decent flip model. I wasn't a happy camper but it all ended up ok cause they never charged us for the phones in which we were to pay $49.99. So unless they end up charging it to our monthly bill we were fairly compensated for their screw up and our double 40 mile round trip.  From the mall we went over to Mike's mom to show her how to use the glucose monitor that was mom's. All she really needed to do was read the book that comes with it but I suppose it is easier if someone shows you hands on the first time. While we were there daddy called me and wanted us to go out to dinner with him. Well, we never turn down a free meal so we went over to daddy's and then we all went to Funck's. I had a sirlion but it was really full of grissle, which I can't stand, but the corn fritters were good! We got back to daddy's and I mowed the lawn for him quick then we were off once again to head back to E-town.  We went over to Linda's and then we all went up to the fair grounds where they are holding the "Relay For Life"(cancer awareness)this weekend. Kim had purchased a luminary in memory of mom and we went to see it be lit. It was very moving. It has been three months since mom is gone and I still have moments where I am overwhelmed with grief. I was fine until it was time to light them and Kim told me I should be the one to light it . They has bag pipe players there and they played a couple of beautiful hymns while the luminaries were lit. Then they read the names of all that had a luminary purchased "in memory of" "or in honor of."  We just got home a bit ago and mike is making us a pot of coffee that smells really good! So, that was my day , a little of this and a little of that. G'night!

						   I have tried several times to journal and never seem to keep up with it. So, once again I will see how long it lasts.    Today I had a breakfast date with one of the women I met at church. I had a bread machine to get rid of and we met for breakfast to make the exchange. We had a good chat, I was there until noon and we got to know each other a bit better. I look forward to spending more time with her, I believe we have quite a bit in common.  I worked in the bathroom a bit this afternoon. I got the shower stall caulked and tomorrow I will start painting. I've gone from using a 10'x 13' master bath to a 4'x 8' bath shared by 4. It's like being in a closet! I vowed not to move back into the master bath until it is completely remodeled so this tiny bath is my motivation.  We switched our phone plans around yesterday. We all had to get new phones but they only had one left in stock so Blake got that one and Mike & I have to go back tomorrow and get ours. Blake said he still didn't have good reception in his room at his dad's so I guess we shall see if it is any better here when we get ours. So far that is the only down side to living in the woods, no reception.  Now I need to go get started on supper. We're having "B" sandwiches. It's honey cracked wheat bread soaked in beaten egg and grilled with smoked Virginia baked ham , provelone cheese and honey turkey breast. These suckers weigh in at about a pound once they are done and are oh so good!

						    I see that I have really started slacker with regular blogs again, oh well.       I got the cabinets and all the trim painted in the bathroom. Now I am back to working on the walls. It is taking so much primer to get the walls covered. I wish it would be done already. Now it almost seems like a waste of time cause we will be moving in the spring in with daddy and won't get to enjoy it long. I guess it is going to help with the sale so...      We are still trying to work out all the bugs with moving in with daddy. I guess he is going to give Midnight away to some people we know, Barry &amp; Wendy Weaber. That will solve the problem of what to do with our cats. We need to figure out something with the beds too. Our king size bed will not fit upstairs and Daddy wants to get a bed smaller than his full but larger than the one that is a bunk bed upstairs now. I took the measurements and am going to try to get that issue resolved next. Donna said we can have Angie's bed which is a queen for upstairs if it fits cause she never uses it, she would rather sleep in her big chair in the living room.       Then of course there is the waiting to try to settle my workers comp claim. The lawyers are working on it this week to advise me how to counter the offer that was made. With that settled we will have no debt other than the mortgage. What I would like to do is get someone to jus take over the mortgage on our house and then we can go right into daddy's with no debts.      I suppose time will reveal all that will happen and we need to take one day at a time and be patient and rely on the will of God. That's it for now, hopefully it won't take me so long to get back here and update next time!

						    Ok, well it's been almost a week since I last blogged. Um, Blake has had band camp all week so I haven't gotten to see him. I got Leah on Wednesday. We went to Hostetter's and bought the paint for the bathroom. I have 2/3 of the walls painted with primer so far.      Friday we went over to dad's to go out to eat. We discussed us moving in with him and eventually getting the house. It looks like we are going to do it. I don't see it happening until spring of 2005 though. We need to go see a lawyer to see how to go about it in the most cost effective way for everyone. I need to get my workers compensation settled first too. And then there is the issue of getting our present home sold. It would benefit us all all the way around without too much inconvenience. Loss of privacy would be the biggest for both of us but I think we can both find a compromise there.      I did receive an offer in the mail for settlement on Friday. I have to wait and talk to the lawyer on Monday but I think I am going to counter their offer for a bit more. If we could get $15000 more it would not only pay off all our debt but put 3 months wages in the savings for a buffer.   Michael said once that is all said &amp; done he wants to "live like old people." In the sense that we only buy things that we have the cash to pay for it outright. NO MORE CREDIT CARDS! It may have taken me 18 years but I have finally learned the life lesson on finances. I would like to incorporate the 10-10-80 plan into our budget as well. From your gross income 10% tithe, 10% savings and live off of the other 80%. You would be sitting well with that in place.      Well that's all that's is going on right now that is worth talking about. Until next time, CHOW
