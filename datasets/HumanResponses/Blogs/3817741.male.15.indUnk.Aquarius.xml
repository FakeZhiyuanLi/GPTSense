      It's done!! My braids are now a part of reality. The length of my hare wasn't ideal yet, but I make a nice  urlLink Coolio  rigt now:      Kinda funky huh. I'll have it redone in about 4 weeks (I'm leaving for Surinam this Sunday). Then it will look more like I first intended.

      As a response to the latest rumors I decided to do this weeks special about the King of Pop (you're damn right it's  urlLink Michael Jackson ). It's being passed around he is about to have quadruplets (4!!!!!!). I don't know if it's true and I don't really want to know, but its reason enough to tell a little something about him. Michael Joseph Jackson was born on the 29th of august of 1958:   He begun his prosperous (sometimes not that prosperous) career as the lead singer of the Jackson 5, performing along with his four brothers (Jermain, Tito, Jackie and Randy). However, the groups gigantic success was just a fraction of Michaels solo career. His albums Thriller, Bad and Off The Wall guaranteed his unstoppable multi-million dollar empire. At age thirteen he launched very successful singles among which Got to be There. He also appeared in the movie The Whiz, where he met Quincy Jones, who thereafter produced many of his albums (like Off the Wall). After this came fame no mortal (speaking for myself here) can imagine. Dazzling his crowd with heartstopping performances, you'd say this multi-billionaire has everything (if not more) than a man could ever want. This is only materially true. Michael has been confronted with multiple traumatizing experiences, like being molested by his own father, severe burning, and of course his reputation as Wacko Jacko(emphasized by his interview with Martin Basheer). Despite all the rumours I still think he is one of the most gifted artists and performers ever.

      I was really busy his week, so I didn't get much posting done. And after last weeks DMX bio this weeks choice is the white rap trio, the  urlLink Beastie Boys .   This musical dreamteam came to be in 1981 as a punk band, members Adam Yauch (MCA) Mike Diamond (Mike D.) Adam Horowitz (King Ad-Rock), after which they went through a quite unexpected style-transition (you know I'm talking about Hip-Hop) which formed the platform the Beasty Boys launched themselves from into the great unknowns of superstardom. However, the band wasn't much of a croudpleaser, and they soon made names as the biggest buffoons in the industry, with their lousy performances and less than appealing lyrics. This didn't change untill they decided to reach out to other players in the business such as Run-DMC. Their catchy beats (not always selve-conjured) and funky grooves prove punk really does mix with Hip-Hop. After several record deals and many number 1 songs you'd think they'd stopped by now. Guess again. They are currently promoting their new album 'To the 5 Boroughs'. Lets keep our eyes and ears open.   And please place comments.

      From this day forward I'll be posting an article about a particular artist every week (for the ones who haven't read the title yet). This weeks victim is  urlLink DMX  (GHHHHRRRRR).   I wanted to start off with him because he's been in the 'spotlight' lately. DMX (although he has more money than any mortal can count) decided to jack a car during his stay in New York. I know this because I went to a concert called  urlLink Urban Nation XXL , which should have featured some of the worlds greatest urban artists (Blaque Ivory,  urlLink Talib Kweli ,  urlLink  DMX  ,  urlLink Sean Paul  &  urlLink Missy Elliott ). Both Kelis and  DMX  didn't show up. Kelis didn't show on account of 'productional reasons' (still hate her for that) and DMX, we already know.   But enough about that, let's talk about DMX. On a grey night in Mount Vernon New York 18 december 1970 Earl Simmons was born (also known as DMX, duh). After his tough childhood in New York, he developed multiple talent in the field of Hip-Hop and performing on stage. He also learned to make emotional contact with his audience. He is about the only rapper who has the guts to cry on stage. After working with Jef Jam for several years he started a rap group called Ruff Ryders (DMX, Eve, Drag-On, The Lox, Swizz Beatz & Parle). The group recieved a lot of credit for their work, but not as much as DMX' personal succes, which consists of four multi-platinum albums (sold at least 3 million of each) apart from his performances around the world. It's safe to say DMX is THE dog in his field and anything but a dog in the field of Hip-Hop.

      Spent most of the day recovering from yesterdays party in the  urlLink Escape  (a nightclub in Amsterdam). The night had a slightly weird kickoff  urlLink trance -only (not to be confused with  urlLink trance -only). At about 1:00 AM things started to get interesting. The DJ started dropping some fresh tracks (R&B, Hip-Hop and Alternative Music), you know, tracks to keep you moving. There aren't any available photo's from the actual party, but it probably looked a bit like this:

      After a less than boring  urlLink match  against Portugal, Greece (the underdog in this context) made its move during the last 20 minutes (a la Germany), and left its opponent and all of Portugal in tears (Christiano Ronaldo most of all).

      I'm gonna get a whole new look. Braids to be precise. They'll make me look a bit like  urlLink Xzibit . For those who don't know him ( urlLink losers ), this is him:   I'm probably doing it in about three weeks. Lets just hope it looks good on me.

      It's official, Marlon Brando is gone. It's a real shame.   urlLink    Marlon Brando was one of the greatest actors of his generation. I just want to say this:   Marlon, You have earned all of my respect  and that of those who were with you back in the day.  We´ll miss you and we´ll always remember you through your work  Respect

       urlLink The Car  (1977) is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The main reason is because back in '77 people actually found it scary. Although its not my right to make fun of it, you really should go watch this movie when your stoned or something. You'll have a great laugh!! For the record, this is THE CAR:

      Wazzup y'all, I just started this to see if I can make a difference in this harsh culture which is the United States of... never mind ... I'm not even from the US. But enough with the jokes. I started this to see if I am of any significance to any of you who are stupid enough to even listen to what I have to say (don't believe the hype!!). I'm a 15 to 21 year old Chinegro currently living in Holland (great country by the way). Check my profile if you want to get to know me better (if anything in there is true) :)
