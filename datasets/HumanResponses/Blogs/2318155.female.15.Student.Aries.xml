      I love Brandon so much. I thought I knew what love was before, but I was so wrong. I want him to be with me all the time, but that never happens. It's so hard to go to different schools, but we make it work. Being with him is the best, there's nothing better than that; it's like a natural high. One month is getting close, one month....it's seems longer than that. "sweet dreams....don't let the bed bugs bite"

      I just received a prank call and they're really getting annoying. The people who called me tonight weren't the usual people and they usual people I shall not say who I think it is....but it's just pissing me off cause it's so stupid to keep on doing this. I mean once in a while is ok, but every weekend is ridiculous. But anyways they were all talkin in Chinese accent which is totally stupid cause I could so tell it wasn't a real person. Yea well then my mom took the phone and she's like oooo the police is trackin your call, what bull shit. Then I went online and some people (i wish not to tell) went and were sayin stuff like to stop talkin about Brandon and my ass being gross. Now this is what really irritates me, when people make fun of my ass. Like seriously how 2nd grade is that? But whatever i don't care if my ass is big cause i know that it is...but common people it's time to grow up, we're freshman not 2nd graders. And this gets me to talking about me wondering how the hell some people are popular. They act all childish and stupid and it's just so irritating. I've come to see that popularity is a joke, funny how i've come to realize this just now.

      I've told you the beginning, but now I feel like talkin about other stuff. I want to show you what Brandon gave me the other day, something I cherish.  I Love You  I feel like I'm in heaven whenever i kiss and hug you I place no-one above you I'm serious when i say i love you You're my girl Pearls aren't good enough for you, because to me you mean the world I'm serious, you're very special to me Ask anyone who ever knew me 'Cause when I lie, you can see straight through me I'm not lieing I'm just trying to tell you how i feel Trying to deal because I know this love is real I know we're only fourteen, fifteen on the next page But who says, you can't love until a certain age? I can't even fit all of my thoughts into this poem Whenever I'm at home, and we're talkin on the phone I swear to god there's nothing better You know whenever we're together and it's cold, then I'll surely give you my sweater I used to think that love, was nothing more than a term A word, used by people who just had a lot to learn I thought that it would turn it's back on you at the first chance And storm out of the room, without a single glance But now I realize, that what the guys told me were lies Because I prove them wrong whenever I look into your eyes Danette, you're someone special and I just want you to know I hope that our relationship does nothing but grow I'm so into you, I don't know what I'm gonna do But I'm gonna show you that i'll keep on lovin' you  This poem touched me so much, and means so much to me. When Brandon gave this to me I felt like I was in the movies, because it's too good to be true. The words flow and rhyme like I've never seen before. For my first love letter, I'd have to say I could have never asked for anymore. For all of you who think that our love is fake, that the guy i'm with is using me and weirdly clingy, this proves you wrong. You can't break us apart, our love is way too strong for any of your mind tricks. I guess this is it for now, but I hope I made you all think twice about myself.

      My life summed up in one word....confuzing. Sometimes I can be happy, other times I can be sad. But who isn't like that? I mean there's no one whose happy 24/7. But sometimes it seems like I'm the only person crying out for help. Sometimes it seems like I don't fit into this world. But other times I'm fine, I'm normal, I'm happy. Right now i'd have to say that my life is awesome, only because I found someone special, someone who I love and cannot be without. But what happens when that is gone? What would I do? How would I deal with myself? You see I love Brandon so much, I could never let go. It's to the point that I could never ever imagine us breaking up. But I shouldn't think about this, breakin up and all. Cause I don't wanna break up with him, i'm just worried, what if? I guess I worry too much, that's my problem. I try to keep a happy image to where no one can see how I feel at the time, but it's hard. I know it's not good, I keep it all inside myself. It builds up day after day, month after month. Until it finally is too much, and I can't handle it, I just explode and say things I don't mean. Usually this happens towards the end of my school year. It's happened for the last, I'd say 3 years. No matter how hard I try to stop it, it never works. But this year I feel is different. I'm in highschool now, away from all the bullshit. I can be the person I've wanted to be for a really long time, not trying to impress anyone. So there it is...some of what I go through in life.  SOME  is the main word. There's no way I could ever explain everything, but I can try. But for now it seems all good, I hope it stays this way. I'm just gonna have to hold on tight, hold on to what I have, and not let it slip away.

      PMS, a parent's worst nightmare. It's pretty weird the way I PMS. When i'm around friends I don't really PMS, but around my parents is a totally different thing. I yell at the for no reason, I'm a bitch towards them for no reason, and I cry for no reason. Lately though i've been doing a lot better. Brandon helped me today when I received 5 minutes notice to the fact that my parents were having company over. This all would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that I was in my undies, hair looked like shit, and my room was a mess. Now usually I don't have to clean my room for my parents friends, but the people wanted to see my tv. Wow was that a hectic time for me. I so badly wanted to scream at my dad, but I calmed down and just moved on. All went fine, we had some Chinese feast over here at my house. I was so stuffed afterwards I felt like I was gonna barf. But anyways, i've been talking with Brandon and wow did we find the best thing to talk about. Cartoons! We were talkin bout Duck Tales, Sailor Moon, The Little Mermaid, Lion King, Speed Racer, The Power Rangers, The Ninga Turtles, Johnny Quest, and so many others; it was the best. It's quite funny how we don't realize how crazy we were about these cartoons when we were little, yet so sad to how almost all of them don't play on tv anymore. I don't think there's really anything else to talk about so...until next time.

      Today has been quite boring. I woke up at 11, but didn't get up until 12. Later today Brandon may come over...I really hope he does. But anyways, last night I received a message from a friend telling me that all the stuff I go through is totally how she feels. Now this is totally awesome! I mean, the whole purpose of this blog is to show everyone what I go through, and at the same time show that we all go through a lot of the same issues; that we're not alone. But, for now I don't have anything to say....but sooner or later I will....until next time.

      Natural beauty is the most beautiful thing in the world, don't ever let yourself think otherwise. This is one thing i've come to realize. So many people teasing me because the way I look. I used to let it get to me, not anymore. I'm me and that's the way it is. If you still don't understand then just turn on "Beautiful" by Christina Aguilera.

      Today I woke up feeling like shit, so I decided to stay home with my mom. We've been laying in bed watching "Crossing Over". Now I usually think that this show is a total joke, but I dunno the more I watch it the more I think that it is real. But anyways, Brandon couldn't come over last night ): But I know that I just have to try and understand with him moving and all, that he's not gonna be able to do something for a while until he's all unpacked. It's been 3 weeks and one day today between us...he asked me out on October 27th. It's funny how we've been together for so little time, yet we have so many inside jokes and memories, it feels as if we've known each other for ever. Me and Brandon I'd have to say are a perfect match, it's weird cause I always knew that there was that one person out there made just for me. But, I never knew that I would find him this quickly. It's the best feeling in the world to be with Brandon and I hope it never ends...

       the happy things in life  laughing so hard your face hurts a hot shower a special glance lying in bed listening to the rain outside hot towels out of the dryer a bubble bath giggling a good conversation laughing at yourself laughing at an inside joke accidentally overhearing someone say something nice about you the cool side of the pillow playing with a new puppy having someone play with your hair sweet dreams hot chocolate swinging on swings song lyrics printed inside your new CD so you can sing along without feeling stupid eating chocolate chip cookie dough spending time with close friends holding hands with someone u care about watching the sunrise laying so close to that special someone that you can hear their heart beat  This right here is so true! I got this from Rachel Egan's away message and I was just so tempted to use it. The last one is one of my favorites!

      Today was pretty good...kinda boring, but I wasn't sick today. English was easy, just listening to people read "House on Mango Street".  In Oral Interpretation we did some congress debate while there was a sub. Chem we looked at elements and how they look when they explode. O ha and in chem Mark Ortega got escorted outta the room by none other than our friendly security, Tony. Don't know what he did, but he won't tell anyone. Spanish I took a test, and did hw...from other classes. P.E. I taught Jessika and Natalie all of our dance, we're getting pretty good. At lunch I bought the whole cafeteria so Alissa, Lindsey, Jen, and I could eat. Sociology I took notes while Dillon Rhosdahl was falling asleep. And in Geometry we had a fire drill, took a quiz, and talked. After school I went to tutor, almost falling asleep on her, but now, here I am talking to you people. But anyways last night I was talking with Brandon as usual and he tells me that he's going to be joining the wrestling team to keep in shape for football. Now, for those of you who don't know much about wrestling, guys have to wear spandex one-piece-jumpers. Wow is this going to be fun or what?! Now this means that he's going to be gone after school at practice ): More time for me to sit here and think about him, waiting for him to call around 6. But, sometimes I can go see him at his meets and kick ass so it's all good! Today I experienced a sad notation, Jessika Spiteri does not have any clue who Tupac is. Now, seriously, how could someone not know about Tupac? He's one of the best, and if even THE best rapper who ever lived. Well, this shows you people how sad living in Danville can be. Now, don't get me wrong, I LUV Danville, it's just that sometimes it gets to be too big of a bubble. So anyways I better start my chem hw...yea that's right, chemistry in the 9th grade, crazy huh? My mom doesn't think so, so of course I can't think so either. But, it's not that hard, I mean I have Shotwell. Anyone with Shotwell should have no lower that a C; do your hw, if even, and you're set. Yea, so I'll be writing back soon...maybe in an hour.

      I just got home from school and signed onto aim. This girl that I know who lives up in Oregon imed me and told me how she thought it was really cute how much I like Brandon. I told her no, I don't like him, I love him. She went on to tell me how she and her bf used to be like that, they went out for a year. One day she was joking and said I don't know if I love you, and he was like yea I know, I like you only as a friend, I think we should break up! She said that he was the first to say he loved her...just like Brandon. Also she said that her bf wrote poems to her telling her how he feels about her....just like Brandon. So one day he loved her, the next he realized he liked her just as a friend. But, the thing is, they aren't friends. For me to hear this is totally devastating because I love Brandon so much and I would never think him do something like this, but...it's possible. I know that earlier in my blog I said that I shouldn't worry so much because it does me nothing good. But, what if? Wow I really don't know what to do. I mean I don't want to think about these things when things between me and Brandon have just started! How confused I am right now, you do not know. Like I said, my life is confusing. But, let this be a lesson to everyone. You realize how much you love someone after you have lost them. I mean, I'm not saying that I don't love Brandon, but wow this is crazy. I need to talk with Brandon, I could never imagine our love ending like that, and I don't want it to.

      Wow I didn't write anything yesterday! Yesterday was an awesome day! I woke up early, but I was surprisingly hyper all day and very talkative. And then after school I made up this test, a geometry test, and I got 97/100! But to top it off, I got to see Brandon! We went and saw Gothika. Now that was one of the scariest and best movies ever. Then when I got home I watched Finding Nemo which was a really good movie too! So, yesterday I stayed up for 20 hours! Today I woke up at 10:30 by the phone ringing from Devin. We talked for a while and then I called up Brandon. I've been watchin the MC Battle and Wreckonize won, which I think that Blind Flurry should've, o well. Now I'm watchin this interview with Sway and Jay-Z. But, I gotta go get ready cause i'm going shopping with my mom. I'm gonna get some new pairs of pants, new long sleeve shirts, and maybe a new cell phone cover! Well I better go have some lunch, macaroni and cheese! "Brandon why did you pick nasty fish stix over macaroni and cheese?"...."Well, if you haven't noticed, macaroni and  CHEESE  is the name"

      All of Thanksgiving Break I decided to be very lazy and not write in here. Most of the reason would be that I was either very busy, or very tired. I think I will start where I last left-off. On Sunday I woke up late and my mom said that we could go shopping if I wanted and get some pants, so I invited Brandon with us. I got 3 new pairs of pants and then we went into Nordstrom's and had some soup and then drove home. Brandon stayed and had some ribs with us and then we watched some TV and then he had to go home. On Monday I slept in and then I had to go to the Orthodontist, but they got things messed up so then they told me to come the next day. Afterwards I sat in the car while my mom was looking at the Library for books. Then my mom stopped at Albertson's, while I sat in the car. Then my mom went and took me to Perfect Ten and I got my acrylic nails taken off. The rest of the day I just layed around and talked with Brandon. On Tuesday I slept in again, and then I went to the Orthodontist and then came home and then I just stayed home and talked on the phone. On wednesday I was woken up at 9:00 because my dad said he wanted me to get up for no odd reason. I got ready and then I had to go to Costco with my mom and then afterwards we picked up Brandon. We went into Blockbuster while my mom went to Albertson's and we got Animal House and 13 Ghosts. We came home and then I made some campbell's soup for Brandon and then we watched Animal House. Afterwards we watched half of 13 Ghosts and then had to stop to have some dinner. We had the best food ever, Chinese food....we had a feast! We finished 13 Ghosts and then afterwards we watched Boat Trip. By this time it was about 10:00 and his mom came and picked him up. On Thursday was Turkey Day! I woke up around 8:30 for no odd reason, just to the fact that my dad wanted me up, again. I got ready, peeled 9 apples, and 10 lbs of potatoes, then talked on the phone. I had to entertain 8 family members from 3-9 and yea that's about it for that day. On Friday I was supposted to wake up at 8:00 so then we could go bargain shopping for day after Thanksgiving day. But, I woke up at 10, same as my mom. We got to the mall at 1 pm and headed straight for Abercrombie and Fitch. I got a sweatshirt, 4 longsleeve shirts, 1 short sleeve shirt, 1 pair of pants, and some perfume. We then went to Hollister and I got 3 longsleeve shirts. Afterwards we went to Nordstrom's and had some salad, afterwards at B.P. I got 1 longsleeve shirt and 2 turtlenecks. Then, I got this new cell phone cover that is blue kinda see through and has these Hawaiian flowers on it. I came home and was verrrrry tired. Brandon invited me over to watch Barber Shop so I brought some dessert over for him. On Saturday I did really nothing, just sat around. Now comes to today, today I woke up at 10 and then I did really nothing, again. I just watched TV and went on the phone and then I did my makeup homework for chem and then studied for some makeup quizzes. Now I'm on the phone with someone who I deeply love and is blasting his music because his parents aren't there. Well that was my Thanksgiving Break, one good break indeed. I really needed it cause I needed sleep and I needed to just RELAX. Hope that everyone else had an awesome break like I did. I can't wait till Christmas break. Driving class, snowboarding, family, ice skating, rollerblading, movies, Brandon, and who knows else?

On Monday boring, Tuesday I snuck off campus at lunch and me and alissa went to subway, On Wednesday me and alissa, devin, omid, and chris went off campus at lunch again and then we got caught by tony! On Thursday Alissa kinda talked with me, but she got in hella trouble and like was all ignoring me a lot. So, on Friday I hung with Jessika Spitieri. Jessika and I get along real well it's just that the people she hangs out with kinda scare me and I feel weird around so I think that imma hang with someone else on Monday. On Friday I went to the dance with Brandon and we had tons of funn!!!! Afterwards we went to In-N-Out and had some burgers! On Saturday I got my hair cut and then we picked up brandon and took him to my house. We wrestled while my mom went and got some el balazo and then afterwards watched "a man apart" and then he had to leave. I went and babysat from 5-11 and got home more like 11:30. Today I woke up at 1 and then talked on the phone with brandon, then i went and took a shower, and then blowdryed my hair. Then, I sat at home most of the day, and then my parents wanted to go out to dinner. We went to Celias and then went to Blockbuster to get "Bruce Almighty". Now I'm home about to have some tapioca and watch "Bruce Almighty". This week has been ok other than the incident with alissa, but hey whatever. I think I may go now cause i smell tapioca and it smells realllly good. Until next time...

      Hey all i'm back, 5 days later. Well, lets see here, what did I do over the weekend? On Friday I came home and went on the computer, I took a shower then blowdryed my hair, ate some Chinese and got dressed and put on some makeup. Brandon called and said he was gonna be at my house in like 15 min and I was pretty close to done. Brandon came and his mom took us to his banquet for Cal high frosh football. We got some dessert and sat and watched people get awards for like 2 hours. Afterwards his mom took us to this pizza place that has really good pepperoni pizza. His sisters sarinated me with their talking of embarrassing things he did when he was little. Saturday I woke up at 6, took a shower and had breakfast, then blowdryed my hair, did my makeup, left for school. I had to go to san ramon at 7 in the morning because of a stupid speech tournament that I had to work at because i'm in oral interp. boohoo. It was sooo boring. I organized donuts for three different places, the small gym for sales, the library for judges, and then the teacher's lounge for coaches. Afterwards I got to stand in the cold and pass out maps to our school to those hundreds of people who had no idea where to go. Then, I went to the library to wait for the judges to be done with their information about what to do, and then time for their one round. That took about an hour and a half to go through all 7 speeches of impromptu of varsity level. Some director guy of the tournament asked my judge if he gave back feedback cause some coach heard from one of his students that he was. WE had to go through a long time of telling him no we didn't, and then I came with him to tell the coach so. The coach was a complete asshole who had this big wart on his mouth with hairs sticking out of it. Them I took some messed up ballots to the Teacher's Lounge, called Wilford on the walkir talkie with no success of finding where she was. Right as I was walking out she walked in, I told her that I was leavin, and about 2 other people that left. I went to the bathroom and then my mom picked me up. I went with my parents to get an xmas tree and then we brought it home and did the yearly ritual on it. Hose it down so that there's no pollen on it and to go the dead leaves off, well at least some of them. Then we stood it up on the stand, and blew it with the blower my dad has for leaves. This process is so that any dead leaves that are not off already, they are taken care of. We put up our reindeer that lights up, our icicle lights, and decorated with these signs and stuff in the dirt. I got ready and then me, Brandon, Missy, and brain went on a double date to the movies. We met at crow canyon to see "Stuck on You", but we got the tickets and then headed for subway. We had our sandwich and then went into longs to get some candy. We headed into the movies and found 4 seats all together. I thought that the movie was an ausome and so hilarious. Then, me and Brandon waited like for 20 minutes for his dad to pick us up, and then he came and took me home. On Sunday I slept in till around 11, watched some tv, called Brandon, and planned to go to the mall, which didn't work out. I had to go to the mall with my mom and we got xmas gifts for some people and some stuff for me too! (: I got this new bra which is so ausome and like all lacy, then I got some more perfume that I've been running out of, and then to top it off some comfy snowboots that are slipper like that are very comfy and imma wear tomorrow. Around 5:30ish I arrived at Brandon's and we watched "Silence of the Lambs", which was a pretty creepy movie. We had dinner, chicken drumsticks breaded, rice-a-roni, and some corn. After finishing the movie we hung out till his dad came home so he could take me home, but after waiting his mom then said she would take us home! Well at least we got to spend some more time together (: When I got home I wasn't feeling so good, and when I woke up it was the same deal. So, I stayed home sick on Monday. I woke up at 10ish and watched tv almost the whole day and taped a news broadcast for this sociology hw at 6. Talked with Brandon for a while, and then went to bed. Today I was woken up, on Tuesday, at 6 in the morning. On Tuesday are our late days, so I usually get to sleep in till anywhere from 7-7:30. My mom forgot, and woke me up like last week. Then at 7 I was woken up by my dad and then I told him my alarm clock didn't go off yet. Finally at 7:30 i got up and had some breakfast, did my hair, got dressed, waited for 5 minutes for my mom to get outta the shower, while I coulda been doing my makeup. So, I was almost late this morning, but to my relief the traffic wasn't too bad. English was pretty easy, just reading the 7th chapter in Ender's Game, which I really enjoy reading. In Oral Interp we listened to 3 impromptu speeches. In chem I made up my hw almost and almost finished tonite's hw. At break I talked with Kaila mainly and then met with Jessika. At spanish I made a card for my mom and dad for xmas in spanish. In P.e. I was sick the day before so I got all crappy events for the track unit. Discus, which I was not there on the day that we learned, 100 dash in which I would've picked anyways, the 400 dash which I wanted to pick also, but then to top it off I received the 800 which is 2 laps and I suck at. I crossed myself off for the 800 and so I have 3 events in which I hope I will do good in. During lunch I had a crappy sandwich and talked mainly the whole time, then I went to my locker. But, before I made it to my locker, I saw the lunch cart, with cookies. So, of course, I got a cookie. Then I went to walk towards sociology and I had a while so I went to throw away my cookie bag outside and I ran into Missy and Brian. We talked for a while and then the bell rang. In Sociology I talked with Devon about his fight with some kid at lunch and then wrote some notes that we had to take. In Geometry we learned a new lesson and then had the whole time to do our hw, which was fairly easy. After school I went to my tutor for the last time and went over my makeup work which was very easy, algebra like hw. I came home had 2 cookies and well, I've been here talkin with you people.

      Well, a little bit over a month later, and here i am. Sadly i actually forgot about this blog for a while. And then i remembered, but i was too lazy to sit down and type. Finally I have nothing else to do and had to resort to this. Not really had, but there was nothing else to do and i said, hey imma write in my blog. Well, enough of me talking about boring stuff. This week of school that i am in is finals week...woohoo yeaaaa! ha yea right. It's been alright, only one of my finals has been hard so far, my chem final. 160 mutiple choice questions and 10 configuration problems, now was that tiring. I took the chem test yesterday and i also had my oral interp final which was a 2 hr congress session. Believe it or not i actually liked it, i got one speech in and a couple questions. Today there was traffic on the way to school and i was late to class, but so was another 5 people so i think she didnt mark me tardy. Mrs.Stanek's test wasn't too hard, and didn't even have preterite in it, ha! STupid lady messed up the test and it was so easy. Then the other final for me was P.E. today. We played a soccer tournament, 4 games. Our team placed 2nd because the last team we played lied and said we tied instead of won. O well, 2nd is still good, but when we couldve tied with 1st that wouldve been ausome. Then i got my schedule, everything is the same except for P.E. 4th period with caldwell, I have it with Ward. Also with sociology i now have health with hunter 5th as usual. O and by the way on tues i had my english final which i thought was pretty easy. This week has been ok, tiring, but at least i have lots of time after school to do stuff. Yesterday went to brandon's dad's shop and louis his friend came along and we went to subway, el balazo, burger king, and louis went to supercuts (b.a. style). ha don't ask if you don't understand. Then after brandon's practice we watched american idol and the o.c. and then my dad came home from a meeting and brought brandon home. Today brandon has practice from 3-5:30 and i have softball training 3:45-4:45. Well, just thinking about that i need to get ready so yea i'll talk to ya'll later (:

      wow its been awhile, yet again. forgot about this blogger and then i remembered because of lookin at someone else's. but besides that lemme get to the point. brandon and i r over just to let you all kno. its was a lil over 7 months and he dumped me because of complicated and personal reasons so now hes on to another girl who they have been goin out by i think this exact date a month. yes ppl he broke up with me and the next day asked out another girl, after 7 MONTHS. but u kno what? i dont even give a shit anymore im over him which is a miracle because that took a long time. about 2-3 weeks after he had broken up with me i went on vacation with my dads friend ricardo and his family. he has 3 boys: one is 7, the middle is 16, and the oldest is almost 18. the oldest one's name is also ricardo and well lets just say he made me get over brandon realllll easily. i kno im bad but hey its summer and i should be allowed to have some funn and not let one person ruin it. missy my dear friend finally got her license which omg is the best thing in the world! the other day she took me out to antioch and we saw dodgeball with ricardo, his fine friend, and believe it or not his lil bro had to tag along. dodgeball was by far one of the funniest movies ive seen in a looong time and wow i luved it. then we snuck into spiderman afterwards but me and missy had to leave early cause she has to BE HOME FOR DINNER. o well we had plenty of funn. gettin lost and oo was it an adventure for us. so now here i am bored as hell sittin in my messy room that would take days to clean and wantin to take a shower but can't. u see my mom and dad hate our front yeard, so we have a million workers in our front yard tearin it apart to the point that the only thing left is gonna be dirt and some rose trees. and well in order for them to do this they have to shut off our water line in case they hit it. its 11:40 and i can't take a fuckin shower and i have to be to work at 2:30. hopefully theyll have it on in time but who knos. yea im workin this summer, im a lifeguard! woo woo. i work at the greenbrook pool and get paid descent money for gettin to lay around and basically do nothin. so thats been my summer, get over brandon, hang with jacquie and try to forget about him, go on vacation, have funn with ricardo, work almost every day at the pool and get tan, and sit around watchin movie after movie so that i can go see adam at blockbuster. ooo now heres a story for everyone. i go to blockbuster alll the time and theres this guy there and i always run into him. his name is adam and he is the coolest guy ever. the only thing is, is the fact that he needs to cut his hair and shave once in a while. so im always goin to blockbuster and hangin with him, last night i told him he should cut his hair and shave. he said welll i used to and heres a pic. he showed me his old drivers license (he's 22) and he looked flat our sexy and by the way, mexican. But, when u see him with his long ass hair and not shaved and this little sprout of facial hair below his mouth he looks like a white dude with very long hair. o and also he kinda resembles johnny depp. i dunno how some person can have short hair and look mexican and then grow it out and look white, but he does and its creepy. so yea, theres my adventures of summer and theyve been actually takin me away from the usual summer is sooo boring! i mean we always have a time of the day that is boring like right now but wow summer has been awesome so far. and ive hooked up with 2 guys. but the second guy i may not name for certain reasons i dont want someone to get mad at me and yea, but not the fact that hes ugly and i regret it its the fact that i explained to u.  -blo job betty on the way to rescue u!

      you kno i was thinkin bout it a week or 2 ago and i realized that im happy that brandon broke up with me. we had our fun and now its over. i need to move on with my life and see that high school is gonna be filled with romance and just havin funn. so thank u brandon for breakin up with me, it was very hard may i say and i cried a lot over it but in the end im glad u did what u did. ive had an awesome summer because ive been able to look at guys and flirt with them and just be a girl. i mean what is summer really about? its about goin to work and doin barely nothin and gettin paid so that u can go and have funn with ur friends and meet hotties. and thats what ive done, i mean vacation is full of chances with guys (ricardo) and then who knos just some good friend of urs that u just wanna play around with or the guy at blockbuster that is so much older than u but u dont really care. hell ill prob look back on it and say what the hell was i thinkin about thinkin bout doin crap with a 22 yr old. but ill laugh about it because life is full of adventures and u just need to live it to the fullest and thats what i am prepared to do ppl. i am prepared to go and have the best summer i can and jsut hope that next summer will be just like the last and maybe even better. summer is a great thing, it makes u grow even if u dont realize it.... blo job betty on the way to rescue u!

      Not much has really happened in the past 2 days now. Me and Adam talked for awhile and then he told me he'd call me back when he got home since that u can barely hear him when he's in his car. You see someone broke into his car and the back window is broken of course so he duck taped it but it still doesnt do the job. And then i was very dissapointed in him, he didnt call me he just texted me and said "sry i just got home" and that was it. nothin like o im tired and gonna take a shower and go to bed so ill talk to u later. o well, anyways the next day i get woken up by my dad callin me on my phone sayin he needs me to do a favor for him. now im so not a mornin person, so if u could imagne me tryin to go online and look up a number for him, well, its just not a pretty sight. he told me the city was palo alto, i typed in san pablo (who knos what the hell i was thinkin). well i went back to bed and then at about 10 my moms like danette dont u have to babysit and be there at 10:30, o shit is right. well i just threw my hair up, washed my fase, ate, dressed, and left. the kids name is ryan and he is such a cutie, hes 2 and a half yrs old and we played with play dough at first. then we painted for a while, and then i asked him if he wanted to go to the park. i got to go and say hi to my buddies at the pool and introduced him to them. i babysat for liek 3 hrs and then she took me home. after that i just kinda hung around the house and watched movies and well just plainly bored. my parents said hey lets go out to dinner, so we went to celias which was awesome as always. there was a mariachi band and all and they played a song for us which was pretty cool. then we went off to blockbuster and i got to see my sexy adam, o was i excited. after i was in there forever tryin to pick out a movie i finally figured out what i wanted and then went home. ricardo called me and we talked for a couple hours and then he got tired so he said goodbye. that was my chance to call up adam so i could talk with him and we talked until he got home and was gonna take a shower and go to bed. lol he told me if i can wait our first date will be the day after my 18th bday, and he wants me to wear a skirt since i never do. adam is a funny one only thinkin bout me and a skirt. but u never kno maybe me and adam will keep in touch for another 3 yrs and maybe we both wont be with anyone at the time and maybe we will have our first date the day after my bday. i dunno its just adam is an awesome guy that i luv talkin with and i dunno i dont feel stupid round him when i go on and on bout nothing. today i woke up to my parents pissed at me cause of my phonebill and the fact that i was on the phone during work and not just on break, which i swear i wasnt. o well its kinda weird how u think u did one thing and u really did another. i took a shower and then had to go to the doctors cause i have a god damn bladder infection and then came home and found my dad, cousin, and his friend cuttin down our palm tree. we got some lunch for them eventually and yea roamed around the town goin and buyin stuff up that we need for vacation. i watched the rest of my movie that adam told me to get and also watched some tom cruise movie which both were really good. but the endings needed more in my personal opinion. so yea i finally got around to packin most of my crap and then cleaned my room. now if u were to see my room before hand u wouldve asked me how it was possible to clean it this much and the small amount of time that i did. well i dunno i just did lol, my desk wasnt the prettiest thing in sight. the way i typed on my laptop was i had to raise my arms in the air so that i could reach other the papers that i had in order to touch the keyboard. and also the laptop was slanted to the side cause of the only spot that was available. well now i threw away a lot of the crtap that was layin round my desk like candy and crap from valentines day that i just hid under months of papers that stack up day after day. my desk now i am proud to say looks somewhat organized to my best i can and now i have this huge area to be able to type to u people and not be uncomfortable at the same time. my bed i actually made and then i cleaned up a few odds and ends on the floor and well my room hasnt looked this good in well i dont kno when. it wont last long tho, i bid u that. o well it makes the parentals happy, cause the fact is, is that were goin on vacation and my dad said i couldnt go unless i cleaned my room. and now just o throw some things away and move some stuff to another place, but an actual clean the desk so that it looks nice and so on. well i think im satisfied so hopefully my dad will too and then well go to blockbuster and see my adam. whenever i call him or he calls me u kno what he calls me, "my love". o and do i luv it when he calls me that, i just say heyyy sexxxyyyy lol. well u all ppl prob think that im crazy and a ho for wantin to be with a 22 yr old, but no were not gonna do anything. were just friends that luv to flirt and kno that we gotta wait til im 18 and hell be o, 25 about. wow and speakin of him he just imed me and said he got off of work early. now he just called me.......damn. today i was gonna be nice to him and surprise him and wear a skirt for him and now he gets off early and now he missed out, he's sad but happy since the fact that hes not gonna get home at 1 in the mornin. well he had to go cause he'll be in the car and then go to dinner and then yea! were gonna talk on the phone. lol i told him that im not a virgin, o and to all u ppl r like what? yes danette winkler is not a virgin, think what u want but thats the way it is i luved brandon and he luved me. we lost it together and it was the best feelin ever. anyways i dont think that ive ever felt so excited in my life because whenever i get off the phone with adam i just wanna scream and jump around cause wow its gettin to be too much. im fallin for a 22 yr old this is nto good at all, i just have to be friends with and and flirt insanly and not have to act upon it thats it. o well the slut i am..... i think now i will go tell my dad that we need to go to blockbuster and take the movies back which we do need to do and then come home and watch tv til my sexy adam calls me. o is it gonna be hell without seein him for over a week ): well ill be back next sunday so i wont talk to u guys, whoever it is whos lookin at this, until i get back. ill have tons to tell all of u ppl and yea im hopin that the last time at tulloch is gonna be the best and craziest time ever! hottie here i come! blo job betty on the way to rescue u!

      back again. just got home from workin at the pool, interesting day may i say. well lets see here where do i start? first off i thought that us guards were goin out to dinner together so i did my hair and makeup and went to the pool. i start emptying the baskets in the pool and right from behind blake pushes me into the pool...great. all the work and he pushes me into the pool, god i hate him sometimes. well throughout the day he splashed and and tried to push me into the pool and well i got really annoyed. some guy complained to us on the board that we werent watchin the pool properly which is bs but i did do a no no cause i jumped into the pool instead of cleanin up. though the reason why i jumped in was i wanted to wash out all the gel that ryan and blake put into my hair. o well fuck him i dont really care if hes a board member or not. then at the end of the day im ready to leave a blake is liek u kno imma push u in the pool with or without ur swimsuit on, so i decided to change back into it so i wouldnt get my clothes wet. well i got home and took a shower and now i feel all nice and clean and now i just need ricardo, cory, or adam to call me and the day will be complete. right now im about to watch a movie when me and alex stop talkin so ill maybe put one more post up if theres anything else interesting enough...that is to me to put up here. blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      wow am i bored ppl. well i just woke up this mornin around 10ish and am surprisingly satisfied for goin to sleep at like 2. well anyways wow was i bored last night with that quiz thing, i dunno i think i had funn doin it. maybe ull learn more about me, who knows? well im back from vacation and it was a blast with lauren! we went to lake tulloch with my parents and stayed at this house right on the lake that we stay at every single year. i think that ive been goin there ever since i was 2 yrs old and we only missed one year cause of my moms surgery on her back. imma miss the place since that it was our last year prob. we now have possession of out knew cabin in dorrington which is up by bear valley resort. but my parents did say we may stay at the hotel on the lake a couple times like for a night or two so we can go boatin. and then we'd go to our cabin after hangin there for a couple of days, who knows? me and lauren had some of the craziest times ever.... french fry daddy, god u lost the kid!, gortons fish sticks, hi my names victor, no bottoms! wow did we have a lot of inside jokes there. u see it was my parents 20th anniversay when we were up there and we decided to go out to dinner at the hotel. we heard from friends that the place had really improved so we went. first i order a diet coke and i get a rootbeer, then we get our salads. the lettuce was clearly outta a bag and not washed, then we got our calamari (golden fried it said on the menu). instead we get these fish sticks, wow was that interesting. then we got our bread to top it off, it was stale and hard and when u bit into it things went flyin! that was it so we left and my dad complained and yea. so we went to sonora to find a place to eat and we found the best place EVER! One Twenty Four is the name of the place, Wayne the pirate is the cook. wow im serious ppl ive never had food this good in my entire life, and for those of u who kno me i eat good over here at the winklers house. so anyways that was my mom and dads 20th anniversay, a very interesting one may i say. we went white water rafting that day, not too hard and had some funn. also that day we officially owned our cabin so the day was actually pretty good.   me and lauren had some interesting experiences with guys while we were up at tulloch, the guys up there are not shy to talk to u and hint that they are interested in u. one day we went up to the store by the gas station to fill up our tube with air, and this guy walks by and starts talkin with us like hey ladies, how ya doin? finally he left and we went to find the hole in the tube in where&nbsp;we would fill it up with air. we spent 15 min and still couldnt find it so i saw that guy with another guy and asked them to help us. as they looked for the hole they asked me to hold their beer bong, lovely. after they found the hole they told us they had to go cause they were goin out on the boat with a bunch load of other guys and some girls. before they left they were liek, hey by the way were havin a party at, some number of a campsite or a hotel room, and he wanted us to go yea right. this guy was ugly and he looked like he was about 24 or older. but i did see some good lookin guys from the distance in the boat, tho u kno me and my eyes (arent so good sometimes). then another time we went to the main store in town and we were lookin for some ice cream, these guys come up to us and say, is this the only store u guys have up here? we explained that we didnt live up there and we talked for a lil and then he invited us to go down to the kiva with them (a place where ppl hang and swim and bbq) that night. he introduced himself as victor and the whole time starin at laurens boobs, lovely. o and who could forget the time we had in sonora, we went shoppin in this cute boutique and right as we walk outside we hear. hey ladies, whistlin and so one. the bad part isnt that, the bad part is the fact that these guys looked old enough to be our dads gross huh? we couldnt take it nemore so we hid in another boutique and then i had to call my mom to pick us up. i had to go outside to make the call and in the corner of my left eye i see 2 guys pushin each other and im like what the fuck r they doin? i musta givin them a nasty look cause after a while they went away. i realized afterwards that one of the guys was pushin the other to talk to me, and...o well. then we went over to baskin robins when my parents picked us up and we got stared at in this grocery sotre that we went to look at some magazines. wow did we have an interesting time like i said. i mean come on when theres ppl on jet skis comin over near our dock and lookin at us it gets a lil annoying,&nbsp;u kno what i mean? i mean dont get me wrong i luved the attention at first but then its like this is gettin to be stupid.   me and lauren had a funn time layin out and gettin tan. wow did we get tan? lauren especially shes liek brown now! and then our tubin experiences. my dad whipped us around this uturn once, and omg did it hurt. we tumbled and rolled we dont kno how many times and well lets just say afterwards we came out of it with a hurt neck and a splittin headache. tho i have to admit it was tons of funn. one time out bottoms went to out ankles and were like no bottoms! lol and laurens boob stickin out to the side of her lifejacket, lovely. o and my dad yellin at me for leavin the blowdryer cord in the sink. hes like u kno thats really dangerous danette, if somethin were to happen bye bye daddy....french fry! omg wow was that one of the funniest things ever?! then my mom yellin at my dad when i went lookin for directions on the raftin trip....god u got the kid lost! woo funn times, good times! i think thats it from the vacation but ill let ya kno if theres nething else.   last night was funn i went to celias with my mom and dad and ran into lindsay and said hi. then i went to blockbuster to renew my freedom pass while my parents went into rite aid. well i wanted to hang with adam while i was in there but he was on his break so i was gonna go meet him but i couldnt renew my freedom pass because i needed a credit card. i called adam and went to go see him at round table across the street, i gave him the middle finger stuck my tongue out at him and then he almost ran me over! lol, he invited me to go into his car and then as i went to sit down omg that was gross! there was an old french fry and an inch thick of cumbs on the seat i couldnt do it, im sry. so i told him id meet him at blockbuster cause i had to get my parents credit card. i got some makeup in rite aid and then i went over to blockbuster to get my movies and renew the pass and see adam mostly (:! he was in the back room so he let me in and no we did not do anything back there, i ate some of his pizza and looked around the tiny ass room that they have and he slapped my ass then he said danette we have to get outta here cause ur temptin me and&nbsp;i dont wanna get in trouble... ok ok. so i got the movies and said bye to him. around 11:30 i called him and we talked cause theres like no one there around that time and yea we had some interesting conversations. i luv adam i really do (but just as a friend may i say) and i cant wait til we can hang and he doesnt have to be busy workin! my parents arent too cool about the whole deal since that hes 22 and all, but what parent wouldnt be? i mean honeslty all i wanna dois hang with him and get to kno him better as a friend. and u never kno when i turn 18 and were still friends maybe well have somethin there u never kno. imma have to sneak seein him until my parents get comfortable with the idea of me and him hangin so missy is gonna pick me up and take me to him and then well hang for a while and then hell take me to missy's house when were done hangin out and shell take me back home. yes i think itll work. well yea thats about it for now....i think.   imma be off to work today for b shift so i gotta start gettin ready, i may have to ride over on my skates or just walk i think. my mom and dad arent here so yea maybe ill get a ride outta missy or peytons mom who knows? after work i think the guards are still gonna be up to goin to petes brass rail, i hope so o well. thatll be funn i think all of us together, i have to admit all the lifeguards are pretty cool...most of them at least. so yea until next time.  blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      just got back from seein i robot. wow was that a good movie! its actually an action packed movie where u expect it to be really good, but its even better than u thought. theres not a lot of movies out there that can do that (action ones im talkin bout), but lead it to will smith. and no ppl me and cory did not do anything together, we went then as friends and left as friends. "ahhhhhchooooo.....sry im alergic to bull shit" wow thats a good line me and cory were luvin it. ha i went to 7 eleven, got some condoms just in case. i feel a lot better cause when the moment comes and u dont have a condom, damn does it ruin the moment. so now that moment wont be ruined....as long as i have my purse with me. well anyways i thought u guys would all like to kno that danette has condoms in her possesion because her ex bf took the ones she used to have. haha well i think thats enough of me talkin bout condoms, damn i really hope this doesnt get to my mom and dad. o well... blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

        wow am i confuzed...i thought that i liked 2 guys at once. but thats not it at all its only one, but hes the one i cant have ): reality bites....its so tru. i saw that movie today, if anyone has never heard of it and wants a good romance to watch then rent it. its officially my favorite movie i think. but yea anyways the one guy that i like, its so&nbsp;weird how i feel about him....its kinda like brandon and me just meetin, its just the thought tha i kno that itll never work makes me feel like shit. here i am again, sulking in my room watchin romances. u kno whenever ur sad about something dealing with guy issues u always go to a good romance. but hey that doesnt make us feel any better about ourselves, it just makes us feel more helpless. funny how these things work, eh?

      hey guys i just got back from a busy couple hours. well my mom came home and she took me to the rouge so i could get my skin care products and then i went to bockbuster and i got dirty dancing the original cause ive never seen the incut version lol and also not another teen age movie. then we went to 2 different consignment centers cause were lookin for antique or antique lookin furniture for our cabin. after that i was off to my meeting at the pool and that was kinda boring...blake was lookin at me tryin to fingd a way to push me in and then ryan sprayed me with some of his water on his hair which wasnt very nice. then i hid inside the clubhouse, jen bought us drumsticks cause she says that whenever she tries to talk to her kids they wont listen unless it has to deal with money or food. and in this case we were gettin paid to be there and also gettin food so that way we really were expected to pay attention. lol i luv jen shes the best boss ever (well shes one of 3 but yea whatever). my parents had to go to their meeting at the pool for the board and so i had austin take me home...its was kinda weird cause me and him havent talked too much so i dunno a lil uncomfortable. so yea here i am now sittin at my desk typin to u ppl, who knows who u ppl are and if there even is ppl readin this crazy shit lol.  today i was really dissapointed....i was supposed to hang with adam and missy but no adam stood me up! he was supposed to call me and he told me he would last night at like 7 and i waited for him to call me all last night and all today and he still didnt call me. so missy wanted to hang with some other friends that she was with and so i let her stay with them and so here i am home with alone with blockbuster movies to watch. woo i get to entertain myslef, maybe ill go walk the dog to get some exercise and then watch a movie. well i think thats enough for now i type too much... blo job betty on the way to rescue u!

      today at the pool was ok, but then when i had to get my letter about the other day's experience with a boardmember it got worse. just because of my parents theyre tryin to make it so i cant come back next year, i hate it. i luv workin there but now i gotta be miss goody 2 shoes and act all proper and not have any fun just to keep the job. is it really worth it? i dunno but i really luv the ppl i work with and well i dunno its just crazy at this moment. after work was a lot better cause all us lifeguards and swim instructors went out to dinner and had some funn at primos and baskin robins. ryan took me there and to home which was pretty cool except the condition of his car was crazy. it takes forever to get it to start and tons of smoke comes out of it that smells hella bad, o and not to mention the rattling of somethin loose in his engine and the bad spark plugs which are making the motor miss. well ryan is a cool kid so i had funn, o god everyone was sayin that we would be a cute couple. damn thats messed up hes gonna be a soph in college and imma be one in high school, lol that doesnt work. hes cool and all but i can only see him as a good friend, not a boyfriend. so he took me home and i talked to my parents about the whole deal at the pool, i couldnt take it ne longer so i went to blockbuster so that i could get a movie so i could relax.   adam was there, god. i hate him now i really do. he stood me up and never&nbsp;even called me after the fact. i mean it was tues night he was supposed to call and then its thurs night he he still doesnt call. so the only way i got to talk to him is because he decided to help me at the check stand at blockbuster. he was like whats up with u, i was like thanks for not callin me and sayin a yes or no i can or cannot go. and he plays all stupid, god i think im startin to hate guys in general now. i hope this feelin doesnt last long because i dont like it, i really luv boys its just these couple of guys just lately are pissin me off and ruinin the rest of them. i wish that he'd call me up and say that he was sry and then we could get over the whole thing, but no he cant hes just gonna wait for me to call him, i kno it. fuck him, i really mean it, its not the spure of the moment pissed at someone its all out fuckin pissed at someone and has thought about the whole deal until they realize what the hell is his matter for over 2 days.   i really dont have anything good to say today except for the fact that i didnt get pushed into the pool and i had a good time with the guards after i got off duty. maybe if im in a better mood ill talk to u ppl, whoever u guys are.  blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      i think today is gonna be a good day....first i wake up by my mom talkin to me about our cabin and it feels like i got the perfect amount of sleep liek right to the second lol. i get to lounge around for a lil and then go to work. austin and i will be there so i dont have to take out the garbage which is a very good thing believe me. last time i went to put away the trash was in the beginning of june with allie and we got trash juices spilled all over each other cause we were weaklings lifting the cans into the dumpster lol. blake i dont think is gonna push me into the pool...jen and karen talked to him and i think hes gonna get written up if he does it again to me. well now all i have to worry about is ryan cause them 2 are friends and the other day he sprinkled me with his wet hair. o well but i think today is gonna be a good one. after work which will be around 8:30 ill be headin home to have some dinner and then ill beg my dad to take me to blockbuster. u see i am extremely pissed off because the fact that i rented dirty dancing (the original) and they have disc 2 in it but not 1. so therefore i need to go there and complain and get another one and make shure that the first disc is in it. also i think ill get theres somethin about marry, that sounds good. o and my best part of the day is when i walk into blockbuster imma turn my head on adam and not even look at him. then when he comes over to say hi imma pretend liek hes not even there, after i find my 2 movies ill go in line and get the movies and leave. ha the silent treatment thatll fix him. i mean didnt call me and let me kno yes or no if he could come and hang with me and that made missy not knoin what was goin on until the last moment which isnt the nicest thing to do to ur good friend. and even after the fact he still hasnt called me...fucker. "u grandmother fucker"....."u mother fucker"...."yes i am" lol i luv that movie. well ill let ya kno what happens when i get back&nbsp;from work but for now i think imma veg on my bed and watch some tv til i decide to jump into the shower and get all squeaky clean (: maybe if ur lucky ill have somethin to say to u guys before i leave...  blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      today is friday and this is my first post which is at 10 at night which is pertty sad. well today at the pool wasnt too bad except the fact that ryan was tryin to boss me around when i was already doin my job. i mean when im goin around pickin up trash around the pool and he says what the hell r u doin, i really wonder what else i would be doin. and then hes liek o u need to help austin watch the pool, but u kno what did austin help me when i was the only one watchin the pool for 3 hrs no i dont think so, asshole. ahhh i need to stop thinkin about work and lettin it get to me, i mean for the first half of the job it was hella cool work and all. but now no they have to take the funn outta it and ruin my summer, bitches.  after work was ok. i just hung around the house and vegged for awhile. the i decided to take a shower and watch "theres somethin about marry" which i laughed my head off like usual. i got ready to go to blockbuster and me and my dad left for our nightly routine. the only thing was the fact that it was so early so adam would be busy and not have really any time to talk. i waited to talk to him and said adam wil u call me tonite in my puppy eyes i can have. he said ill try and i said thanks cause i just dont wanna be mad at u and vis a versa and then i had to say goodbye ): i really hope that he calls me sometime tonite so that we can just get over this whole stupid thing and be friends again. if he calls me im tellin u ill prob be the happiest person on earth even if he tells me to fuck off. u see the thing is when ur sittin there thinkin is he gonna forgive me...yes or no its a lot worse of a feelin than u already knoin that no its not gonna work. i kno most ppl would say theyd rather just wonder, but not me im not like that.  tomorrow i hope will get even better cause its been gettin better day by day. hope thats a strong word. its a word that i use a lot which in a way is a bad thing cause im always hopin for somethin to happen. in another way hope is a wonderfull thing because most people give up. wow i think everyone is confused at this moment.&nbsp;o well i think ill stop while im at it.  like i said yesterday, if im in a better mood ill write some more to you people.  hopefully  adam will call so that i can tell u guys all about it.... blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      its early in the mornin right now and im gettin ready for work woooo. last night adam didnt call me so now i have the feelin that he doesnt wanna talk to me ever again ): well maybe ill be able to catch adam at a good time when hes not doin any thing and can talk to him about the whole thing. i dunno i just dont understand whats wrong cause i think he may be mad at me for given him the cold shoulder the other night cause he was fine that day. i cant let him get to me cause i mean it anyways wouldnt of worked between the 2 of us until i turned 18 and come on how would we be able to stay in touch that long. like missy said i shouldve stopped where i was at so that i didnt get hurt and now im in that position just liek misst said. o well whatever.   today at 9:30 im goin over to peytons house so that his mom debbie can take me to work cause my parents are outta town for the day. then ill be at the pool til 3 and then walk over to my grandparents house and have to stay over there until my parents get home boo. well right now im listenin to hilary duff and it makes me feel better when i listen to her music, u kno that type of music that makes eveything just feel perfect and that theres nothing wrong in the world? dont u luv it? well i better be gettin ready to leave so ill be back later, hopefully.   o and by the way blockbuster is pissin me off! first i get dirty dancing the original and they only had disc 2 in it not 1 so i couldnt watch it until i went back and switched it. also last night i got starsky and hutch and they forgot to unlock it so that i could open up the container! i swear blockbuster with adam and all the movie problems hates me. but u kno im afraid that hes thinkin that im goin stalker mode on him because he was tellin me bout this other girl but she was nothin liek me but still u never kno what he thinks. btu im not his stalker i just really liek him as a friend and i thought he did too, he even told me so. im talkin too much.  blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      im back! my parents went up to our new cabin and i had to stay home and work at the pool while staying at the granparents. o tons of funn i ashure u....cough cough. well anyways where i left off. on saturday i worked with bryan which was funn and well interesting, u see hes gonna be a senior and he acts and looks liek hes gonna be a junior or maybe even a sophomore like me lol! i mean its just hes not mature at all but i dunno he just talks too much, just like me i guess. after work i walked to the grandparents house and stayed over there. we went out to chiles and i saw adams car across the street, so i knew i had to figure out a way to get over there so i may have a chance to talk to him about everything. i talked to my grandma and i said that either i could get a movie from my house or if my grandpa would take me to blockbuster i could get starsky and hutch. she wanted to see starsky and hutch and so i was excited for the fact that i may be able to talk to adam about the whole deal. my grandpa took me to my house and let me get all nice and clean since i had been at the pool all day and then he took me to blockbuster. i saw adam there and we looked at each other. since the fact that it was early there was a lot of ppl there and i didnt get to be helped by adam at the stand so i didnt get to talk to him, i just looked at him like i wanna talk to u! i got home and we watched it and then i watched a little bit of tv, surprisingly i was tired around 10:30 and jumped into bed.  this mornin i woke up at 10 and got to have my grandmas scrambled eggs in which we call the "a thousand pieces". wow are those good, she puts in real milk and margerine so its really flavorful and melts in ur mouth! i then again watched some more tv and then had lunch around 1 and had a peanut butter sandwich (without jelly). after that i had some pork and beans, and then i had some salami, lol i kno that it sounds bad but it was actually really good. i got ready for work and got there at like 2:30 instead of 2:45 so i was nice and early. today was so crowded i couldnt belive it, there was around 60-70 ppl in the pool at once from 3-5pm. though it was really warm today so thats why there was a lot more ppl there on a sunday. i got to work with taylor who i have found out is also gonna be a sophomore and hes even younger than me! he turned 15 june 8th so im quite excited about that. hes really cute, hes liek in between hot and cute. but the thing is hes not my type cause hes really quite unless he was just like that cause we first met. o well, anyways after work was finally out my dad picked me up and we went to my grandparents to pick all the rest of my stuff up. god we ended up stayin there for an hour talkin bout our cabin, well it actually was my dad doin all the talkin to i just sat there and looked at the tv on mute. the simple life was on (nudist coloney episode) so that kept me occupied for a while. finally we got to leave and i came home and realized that i wanted to talk to adam...badly. so i dragged my dad down to blockbuster and happily adam was there!   yes this is worth another paragraph lol. so i walked in got my movie i wanted and walked to the register where adam was standin. he gave me a look like i miss u/im mad at u and i gave him the look&nbsp;like i miss u/ im sorry lol. hes liek what u want in a sarcastic voice? i was liek what do i want, o u kno what i want. so he ended up tellin me that he didnt have his phone all that day so thats why he didnt answer it, then when he finally checks it he sees all these messages by me and was liek what the hell? and then when i go to blockbuster that day i gave him the cold shoulder when he wanted to talk about it and then he got mad at me cause i assumed that he was ignoring me when the fact is he never had his phone with him. now most ppl would be like yea right its an excuse for him to make u feel bad but really i kno when adam is tellin the truth. so i got mad at him for standin me up for nothin ppl, thats the story. i admitted to him that i messed up cause i assumed that he was ignoring me and then got all mad at him and i told him that i was guilty. i told him that i was sorry and if he would forgive me. he told me i dunno about that one, so i was like o come on u wont forgive  me ? (i gave him my puppy dog look lol) and he said i dunno danette. so i said i dont kno what else to say other than i was guilty and im so sorry and i hope that we can be friends again. so he said wellll i guess thatll do.&nbsp;so now i think that hes not mad at me anymore and now we can talk on the phone late at night when i have nothing to do! im happy, but i cant get my hopes up cause u never kno he may not call me. he may just have said that to get me to leave but i doubt it, i just hope that he'll call me or if i call him that he'll answer.   so anyways now that thats all out of the way i think life is gettin better slowly day by day. cause it was suckin with the incident at the pool and then ryan bein all bossy towards me and then adam and then havin to go to the grandparents and not bein able to stay home alone. yea its all comin back together, finally. yes i am in a good mood! i just hope that adam doesnt change his mine or somethin stupid like that.  tomorrow i get to go to the pool and do some water drills and show off my mad lifeguardin saving skills lol. that'll be quite interesting since the fact that most of the ppl will prob just fool around most the time. well i get paid to be there so i cant complain. tuesday ill be babysitting for ryan and takin him down to the pool and gettin even more money. then on wednesday i get to babysit nick and make even  more  money lol! thursday im workin the a shift with who knos since that justin is gettin a sub cause hes gonna be outta town now. fri i may have off unless i decide to take allie's position as a sub. shes got mono so she wont be workin til she gets better. sat i work with hilary and then who knos what else i'll be doing. good week of working i have to admit! well i better lay in my comfy bed and watch wither super troopers or office space, i dont kno which one to decide on. im in a good mood! wooooooo blo job betty on the way to rescue u!

      o do i luv the feel of chlorine in my hair! i jus got back from lifeguardin drills in the water, o tons of funn. we did pretty good i think except for the fact that jess and hilary didnt do good on the backboardin. o and afterwards we got tons of pizza cause karen ordered 4 extra larges for a certain time, but they delivered them early. so, we got another 4 extra large pizzas for free later when they were supposed to be delivered! can u say pizza for lunch for a reallllly long time? lol. i was just thinkin yeaaaa i dont have to be at the pool til thurs but nooooo i have to go to the pool with ryan the kid im babysittin tomorrow. so really i just have a day away from the pool and then work for maybe 3 days straight if i take allie's sub position.   today was a lazy day, i just sat around and watched office space and tv. office space i have to say was really good as many ppl have said, i think the only reason why i havent rented it sooner is the fact that whenever i wanted to i was with brandon and hed already seen it too many times. today i dragged my dad down to blockbuster at 10 after my water drills. i got monstor and the rundown. ive already seen the rundown tho it was a really good movie so id see it again, and then monstor i havent seen it and ive kinda been avoidin it since that its supposed to be super creepy and weird but i cant resist. i think imma watch monstor tonite since i luv a good spook.  im so proud of myself ppl, u see whenever i start talkin on the phone with someone then i tend to want to talk to them day after day. and i kno that some ppl arent too fond of the telephone and well adam i was startin to tell was one of those ppl. so im not gonna call him every night so that he can be left alone sometimes without annoying danette callin every night. i just wish that one day me and adam could hang one day and hes not at work and we dont have to be glued to the phone. i really need to get my license i really do.   well i think that thats enough talkin for now, if i have anything interesting to say to u ppl later tonite then i shall type another post. but most likely i wont have enough energy to stay up so ill turn my computer off and go to bed. maybe ill be tired and maybe i wont. who knos? tomorrow imma try and get up at 10 and then get ready for the day so that i dont lay in bed all day. at&nbsp;4 i gotta babysit ryan so that'll be interesting. blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      hey all im happy! lol and yes adam and i did talk last night on the phone (: i decided to call him and were cool now so i am quite excited and feel tons better! i just told him that i wanted to be friends that hes a really cool guy that i luv talkin with. yaaaaa!!!!  so anyways i woke up thisa mornin had a bagel and then watched office space in which i have never watched and heard that it was really good. and in deed it was a good movie. i also last night watched super troopers which was hilarious as i aslo heard. ive been renting good movies lately ive realized. next i think ill get "fight club" if they have it in and "from hell" with johnny depp!  today i get to go to the pool and do water drills and practice in case of an emergency happens. tha'll be interesting, and like i said at least i get paid. blake will be there, god i hate him. u kno i used to have a crush on him cause of course i thought he was really hott and was a pretty cool guy. and ryan keeps on botherin me sayin i kno that if blake and his gf werent together ud be tryin to get with him at any second. and that relly makes me mad because blake&nbsp;has gotten really annoying and i just have given up. also i cant even trust him with tellin him anything cause then he goes and tells other ppl, like maybe my boss's. i kno that me and allie hate him officially and there may even be more ppl that&nbsp;i dont kno of. stop complainin danette, i really need to stop.  ill be back later if i have anything else to say, but i have to say i am in a good mood other than im annoyed with blake. im happy that me and adam can still be friends cause thats all i want right now (: blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      today is yet again another lazy day. soon ill jump into the shower and the get ready. i have to babysit and i either have to be there at 4 or at 6 so i need to call the lady up and ask her what time it is. ryan is a pretty cool kid, just a little bit hyper so i dont think it'll be too bad. imma take him down to the pool if he's up to it so that the time will pass by quickly. im hoping that his bed time is like at 9 so that when were done with the pool itll be 8 and then walk home and get him ready for bed and then i get to relax and watch some tv. ill be there past 11 so i wont get home til super late. i doubt that my dad will let me go to blockbuster and get some movies cause it'll be so late o well.   u kno ive noticed that all the comments that i get are from missy and i think that its really sad that no one else looks at this then. so ppl if ur reading one of my posts, write a comment please. anyways i think imma go and jump into the shower and call up the lady who im gonna babysit for. i may be back later, who knos?   o and by the&nbsp;way last night i was watchin monster and i couldnt stand the movie. so im sorry to say but monster was the first movie ever that i couldn't watch the end of it and had to turn it off. and for the ppl that kno that im a movie freak and liek almost every movie, u kno that this movie has to be SAD.  blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      just got back from babysitting again. thank god it wasnt a repeat of what happened last night, i got like over 35 bucks so thats cool. we had pizza and chocolate milk while we watched like 7 different episodes of sponge bob. then we watched some amanda show and finally i read to him harry potter the third book. he went to sleep and i sat on the couch and started to watch some tv and then what do u kno? they get home early and i get to go home early wooooo. tomorrow i getta work like ive been sayin over and over. i think im happy more or less to since that babysittin is kinda a hassle unlike lifeguardin that is relaxin. i have no idea who im workin with so i get a surprise on that part! fri im workin for allie in the mornin and then at night i get to babysit nick again. wooo 3 babysitting jobs in one week, i think thats a lil too much dont u think? o well money money money.  so anyways i get home early tonite and im liek yaaaa i get to go to blockbuster! but nooo my dads liek well go tomorrow im tired and have a early start. i really wanted to see adam instead of gettin a movie and i kno that my dad knew that thats what i wanted to do. hes catchin on.... blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      babysitting from hell. thats 3 words to explain tonite. here we go.... i get there and ryan is about to cry when his mom is gonna leave so some crazy lady across the street comes over to make shure that he doesnt give me any problems. natalie (the mom) leaves and ryan is fine thank god. he says he wants to go over to mary's (the crazy lady) house. great i get to go into some ladies house that i dont even kno, just hope that i dont get kidknapped or anything like that. thankfully as u can see im ok cause im typin to u ppl about it. after stayin there for 10 min we went back to ryans house and&nbsp;i pushed him on his swing and then we played frisbee with his dog shelby. then we went to the pool and i got splashed like hell by these little kids in the baby pool. finally ryan wanted to leave so we went back to his house and i had some yummy tortellini and marinara sauce. the only thing is ryan the whole time made a complete mes outta eveything. first he spills his juice so i have to give him a sipper cup, then he decides to play a game called "ryan drops his food, danette cleans it up, ryan laughs". belive me its not funn yet ryan thinks that its hilarious. after cleanin up the whole kitchen we went and watched thomas the train. just what i wanted to do tonite, then i read him some books (about all that he has to be exact, god) and he was ready to go to sleep. i turn off the lights and he seems fine, but then i cant find my phone. i have to turn on the lights in there and look for it and its not there and now hes cryin wantin his mom, great. after all that i find my phone in the other room where i over looked it, so now hes cryin and i dont kno what to do. i try everything and nothin is workin so i try and call natalie but she's in the theatre watchin the play. later on his dad called (the dads name is linsey, isnt that weird?) and calmed ryan down a little and now its time for another book or 2..... now its time for thomas video, AGAIN. and then just what i wanted to watch, sing a long songs with thomas the train! there was 2 sing a longs to be exact and we had to watch them over and over and over. so then we had to resort to watchin lilo and stich on disney channel until she came home at midnight. isnt that great for a 2 and half yr old? well yea finally im home and happy with the money in my hands, 66 dollars to be exact.  anyways enough of my complainin. before hand my dad and i went to get paint for our cabin and then afterwards i got 2 movies and no adam was not in there so i was dissapointed. and then that was the time i had to leave for babysittin. so today was full of lazyness, dissapointment, and hell. o funn day wouldnt u say? and guess what i get to do tomorrow? babysit nick. woooo, uh no lol. more money at least.   i think imma go to bed now, i prob will sleep in so i wont be able to talk u ppl til late in the afternoon. sometimes i wonder what it'd be like if i were still with u...... blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      o by the way i blake is still workin at the pool. he has a broken foot and what he does is take off his removeable cast and jumps into the pool and does not use his foot that is broken the whole time. then when he gets out he puts it back on and when he has a long break he goes and lays in the clubhouse and elevates his leg. im mad cause he really needs to go, hes being all mean to austin too. he calls him betty croker if hes bein good and if hes supposively bein bad then he calls him martha stuart.

      work....again. and this time it was voluntary, can u believe that? i was being nice and i subed for allie who has mono. the pool was dead and wow was it great, ryan was being really nice and cool and bryan wasn't being so freaky and hyper. then ppl start comin and ryan starts being an ass towards me, and bryan he mellows down even more. i think someone stole 10 bucks from my purse cause theres two 5 dollar bills missing from my wallet, if i find out who it is...haha theyre dead meat! o and also i got my schedule for all the august, the 9 days im working theyre all night shifts! im mad and someone is gonna pay! lol.  after i got off of work i got to go home and take a shower and get ready for babysitting. babysitting was cool, got a 5 dollar tip! woo woo. omg it was the most embarassing thing ever. ok so me and the kid finish watchin looney toones back in action and we go to watch some tv. what pops up but a porno on some porno channel. and nothin is censored if u kno what i mean. i was liek uhhh change the channel right now, change it! lol, i hope he wasnt the last one watchin it, yet it is kindy freaky thinkin of his parents watchin it!  got home and then after talkin on the internet for a while i dragged my mom to blockbuster with me. omg it was sooo scary. adam came up to me all cheesin and shit. and i give him a closer look cause i kno hes up to somethin and he has a fuckin taranchula in his hands! not a baby one this is a full big huge thing, scary as shit too. so he starts comin after me with it and im walkin away and finally he stops and i start talkin wiht him but in a distance in between rows so that he doesnt pull anything funny on me. finally left cause he moved outta my way and then went home.  me and lauren were talkin and i showed her this website with ricardo's friend, vinny minton. hes this salomon inline street skater and hes pretty damn hott. laurens liek damn hes fine so we were talkin bout ricardo a lil. i was tellin her how he hadnt called in a while and all. and guess who calls a couple minutes later? ricardo. yup isnt that a lil creepy? hes liek im pshycic (dont kno how to spell it) i told u lol. well now he had to go cause someone else was on the other line, prob for one of his parents.  anyways i think imma go and watch my movies. "from hell" most likely is my candidate tonite, scary movie with a really hott guy...johnny depp. i shall wait for one of my 2 lovers to call me, adam or ricardo ( u notice how i put adam first hehe). blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      just got finished eatin din din a lil ago. today was a good day i have to admit. so i sleep in til 12:30 this mornin and am all rested up and then guess who calls? cory and gavin. so they wanted to hang out but i had to go to work so they said theyd come down and visit me. u see gavin got dumped by his gf and so i guess cory was tryin to hook me up with gavin or whatever so i went along with it cause ive heard how much the ladies luv him lol. so they came down when i had just got there and dissapointingly ryan was down at the pool just swimmin and hangin out. but since that he was our temparay head lifeguard i knew id get in trouble with havin them there. so i got to meet him and talk for a little and then they were off. now i didnt think that gavin was all the good lookin, he defiantley has that bad boy look to him but i dunno i dont kno what the big deal is all about. so i went off to start work and thought that it was gonna be so boring until cory and gavin could come down and hang when ryan had gone and there would be no one there. but they went off to corys house to go drink so cory had his cell off and he was probably fucked up majorly. and then guess who shows up but jason and jeremy. wow was i happy.  a couple of weeks ago jason and jeremy were down at the pool with leila and she introduced me to them, and thats how i got to kno them. jeremy was always the one who talked a lot and i kidna was interested in but he has this big head and i dunno it was kinda weird lol. so me and jason get to talkin and i realize how cute/hott he his and how nice of a person he is too. me and him talked like the whole time they were there and finally he asked me if i wanted to go see the village with him. so i said i dunno i may be able to but that sounds pretty cool. so he had to leave eventually after tons of flirtin between the 2 of us and they left. later on he came back to get my number and he said that he could go and so all i had to do is find out if i could go. so my dad says no, like an immediate no! lol i didnt argue and liek 5 min later he calls me and says that its ok! i was soo excited cause i think i really do like jason. well there was no one there from 6 o'clock on except for some of ryan and bob's friends. i asked lisa who had just gotten back from vacation and was workin on our time cards if we could close up early. she said no but she did say that if taylor (the other guard) wanted to close up then i could leave early! sweet is right. so i asked taylor to do a big huge favor for me and he said he'd do it cause i said id clean the whole place up so that hed only have to take in the couple of things that i couldnt take in. i left, my dad picked me up, we got to the theatre and he wasnt there. so i figure maybe hes just not here yet, so i buy my ticket. right as i buy it he calls me and says that his grandma or whatever wont let him go now ): he said he was so sorry and that hed call me later tonite and that we can do somethin tomorrow so i guess its all good now. by the way his picture is right below this blog for all u ppl to see how sexy he is! lol. ill let u guys kno anything more that happens between the 2 of us. but for now imma go and ask my dad to take me to blockbuster and then come home and watch a movie. yay life is gettin better!!! blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      (continuation) ok so missy says that she wants to hang so i said that i was totally up to it. at 8:30 she picks me up so we can go off and hang at brians appartment with sarah, miguel, and ben. my mom first says that i have to be home by 10, and then i convince her to 10:30. but then when we were hangin out im like theres no way imma be able to watch the whole movie and be home on time. so i called up my dad who is at our cabin right now and asked him if i could stay later. haha i got 11 and no later sweet. me and missy went and got popcorn (in which she was the only person who ate some) and then some cheetos cheese puffs (in which only the 2 of us ate). we went back to brians appartment which i have to say is very interesting. i mean he lives with 2 other ppl and the place is a mess. like hes only lived there for a couple of weeks supposively and his room, god its worse than mine! and u kno its weird lookin at college life cause the fact that u have like no money and ur always tryin to scrip for anything free u can get and buy the cheepest things ever. for instance we all wanted ice cream so we went and got ice cream back at the store and then were like o no we dont have any spoons at the appartment (yea thats sad) and so we were gonna buy some but the guy who was helpin us at the cashier said that hed hook us up with some free ones from the soup place. he got 2 regular sized ones (for me and missy) and then there werent any more other than these fee sample little tiny ittsie bitsie things so haha everyone else was screwed. and then brian found some paper bowls which was amazing ( i hope they were clean lol). and we gave the ppl with tiny spoons the bowls lol. me and missy totally attacked that tub of ice creaml. it was chocolate with brownies in it, mmmmm. so anyways sarah and miguel got some supposive scary movie called minus men and it was sooo boring. like honestly it had no point and we just ended up talkin through the whole movie. ha and also we had to watch it on brians laptop cause ben had his playstation or whatever and we could barely hear it. that was an interesting night id have to say. missy took me home and i swear i thought i was gonna be in so much trouble cause it was a couple minutes past 11 and ha my mom was asleep and i woke her up and was liek im home its 11 o'clock on the dot! and shes liek good girl lol im way too good.  when i got home i was talkin with ricardo on the internet and then nick wants to call me. so we wnd up talkin for ever like til 5:30 in the mornin damn is right. nick id have to say has gotten a lot more mature, good to have a old friend back in talkin relations. well i gotta go to work and cory and gavin r gonna meet me there and we may hang for a lil. blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      i told him im getting too attached to him and that ive been tryin not to. he asked me why? and I told him that the fact that he’s leaving next week on tuesday and then i wont be able to see him since the fact that he lives in oregon. he hugged me and said that he’d call me every other day and that he’d be back in december to see me. he made me feel a little bit better but wow this is really getting to be too much. i don’t wanna get hurt, i don’t wanna cry this summer, i don’t want him to leave…and you kno what? hes becoming the perfect guy, the guy im always looking for and now I think I found him and there he is…only one thing in the way of us. He lives in OREGON. ):

      today was a verrrry good day! got up early and got ready to go to marine world. i went with jason and his cousin josh and we had bootles of funn! so on the way there we get lost and we end up following these mexicans who were goin there. me and jason are in the back of the car playin cards as i give him the look like i wanna kiss you sooo bad! lol. he told me chill chill u can wait another 15 min. so we finally get there and his aunt and cousin have to ger outta the car and get the tickets. me and jason make out in the car when theyre outta site and wow was i happy, i was in heaven. so then we get into the park and yeaaa we get to ride the roller coasters! we went on so many i almost started to get sick of them lol. we had a funnel cake and icey (dont kno how to spell it lol) and then soda and wow thats just too much sweets for me! i was on this sugar high and then when it started to wear off it sucked! all day me and jason would kiss and hug and be all over each other in the lines, i think it annoyed josh a lil. ha o well! bein in his arms is the best feelin in the whole wide world, he makes me feel safe and id have to say like ive never felt before! better than with brandon im sorry to say. when we were in line for medusa there was music playin and im in his arms and hes singin in my ear and wow i was like ahhhhhh. i just wanted to stay there forever and him sing to me and stay in his arms...i luv how hes always sayin babe u want anything? u want some candy, some soda? what do u want babe? hes so good to me! lol. we had a really bad headache and were tired and needed to sit somewhere so we went to the bleachers for the dolphins and we passionately kissed and then i started to get sad...im like i dont wanna leave this friday for my cabin. and i think his depression pills started to wear off cause all of a sudden he became really sad lookin and we were talkin bout him leavin on tuesday and all. i wish i could either stay here or him come with me to the cabin. but most of all i wish that he didnt have to leave for oregon. but i did find out that it more or less takes 5 hours to get to his house he said so thats a little bit more reashuring. when i get my license ill be drivin up there for a weekend as soon as my parents will let me. and if he would get off his lazy ass he could get his permit and should have been able to get his license soon. sept 5th is his bday so yea he'll be 16 then. anyways his aunt came to pick us up and we got in the car. damn was i tired, we played more poker and then i got home and has to leave him. so i went inside and i took off my wet clothes from the water ride and then ate some din din! that made me feel tons better and then i went to work on my nails but i had to take the dog for a walk. came home worked on the nails and then jason came online! were gonna meet again tonite and go somewhere special where only a couple ppl have access to! hheheh im so naughty! ooo i got this airbrush tatoo at marine world and its a chinese lettering that means naughty! lol its soo cool i luv it to death! right now im listenin to hilary duff and wow i feel soo good listenin to it, its weird lol. anyways i think imma lay in bed and take a lil nap cause tonite shall be eventful! wooo blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

       "Laying there with your arms around me I felt so comfortable and safe. My heart was beating a mile a minute having you so close to me. As you played with my hair and kissed me I couldn't help but smile straight from my heart. I could see how much you cared from the look in your eyes. It made me never want to let you go. To just stay wrapped in your arms forever. Where nothing else matters but me and you."~Robyn Workizer  "Why is it that we spend a lifetime trying to define what love is.. what love means.. yet we know in an instant if we are in it?"  "Everytime I look at you, I know how much I love you. As soon as my heart skips a beat, I know. The second I feel the first butterfly in my stomach, I know. When I can't get rid of a smile that has been on my face since you left, I know. The way my eyes light up when you walk into the room, and how through out the day, you're the only thing on my mind. When you look at me with those big colorful eyes, I know you know too."  these are some quotes that remind me of jason! (:

"When you are in love, an hour apart feels like a lifetime, but together, that same hour feels like a second in Paradise. I want to be in Paradise forever."

      wow tonite was a crazy night. so im walkin down the ironhorse trail and im scared as shit. and then all of a sudden this huge light shines behind me and its the moon! lol. the whole time im walkin down the path im lookin behind me every 15 sec all paranoid and shit. so then im walkin down the path to get to his house and i see someone, but im not shure if its him or not. so im liek jason? jason? and he doenst answer and then at the last second when im about to shit my pants hes like heyy its me! lol scared the fuck outta me. so now im happy and were walkin off to the school and im in heaven again! while in the middle of doin stuff we hear someone yell some crazy shit, liek noises. so were like o fuck what was that? well we find out that theres some mexican dudes cleanin kids country and so jason goes to ask him for a smoke which i protest but hes says he just wants to kno. but both of the guys gave him really bad looks and said no. we walk over to the grass area and he tries to get a soda but the machine steals his money. i try and climb the machines to get to the top of the building but he pulls me down, well at least my pants id have to say lol. we decided to keep on walkin so i show him the way to get to my house from the trail and then i walk him back to his house since that he was too "scared" lol. we kissed and i told him that i luved him! he said i luv u too and we just looked into each others eyes and wow everything seemed perfect at that moment. so we said goodbye and i walked back home by myself ): i was a lil scared but not as much this time around. like 2 minutes of walkin and he calls me and says he misses me already! ahh thats so cute i think because most guys wouldnt do that at all. i finally got home, quickly undressed and got a drink of water. right as i sit down he calls me and we talk for a lil and he told me ill see ya at noon! tomorrow were goin to six flags marine world which is gonna be a blast. 7 straight hours of bein with someone i luv is the best thing in the world expecially when ur tryin to fit one week of time that u have left and then not being able to see the person for 4 months.  u kno id have to say that i thought that all guys couldnt express their emotions, and i kno that all girls hate that fact about guys. but u kno what? jason isnt like that at all so far, he doesnt play any stupid mind tricks on u, no games or anything like that. its amazing to find a guy like this... blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:

      ok so i wake up by my dad callin and sayin i have to get up and go to work and that he expects me to clean the office if i have time. so of course i dont have enough time and then when im about to go to work my mom takes me to jasons house to apologize to his mom about the whole deal the night before and then i was off to work on that bad start. i was so fuckin tired and my eyes felt bloodshot and i kno i still had it in me. i was cravin it like a bitch too. so then whenever i try and do somethin like pick somethin up im always droppin it and its frustrating me like hell. so then karen come sout and says she needs to borrow me for a lil and so i go into jen's office. there was some lady who left a message on the answering machine and she was complainin that there was some girl chasin around some guy and wrestling him and they were in the clubhouse too and it was on the day i worked and the shift too. so now imma get in trouble for somethin i didnt even do, again! god damn this pisses me off, im prob gonna get fired if i get written up for this. so im like great my day is goin by sooo well! so yea that was pretty much my day from hell and i still havent been able to talk to jason since that he called me when i was talkin with my parents when i was in the other room. ): i miss him sooo much i really do! blo job betty on the way to rescue u!
