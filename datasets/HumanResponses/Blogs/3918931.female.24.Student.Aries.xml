       urlLink    I drove up to Maryland on&nbsp;Monday (9 hours) to renew my insurance.&nbsp; I must personally sign the paper, so I must be there to&nbsp;do it.&nbsp; So I went up, signed the paper in 2 minutes, and then I was done.&nbsp; I decided that while I was up there, I would go to my little brother's lacrosse game up in Annapolis.&nbsp; He played ok...but they got killed 10-2.&nbsp; Ta well...maybe they at least had fun.&nbsp; Later, I got a call from University of Maryland saying that they have yet to receive my transcripts.&nbsp; The transcripts I "supposedly" had sent from FIT back in May.&nbsp; Good ole FIT.  &nbsp;  So, yesterday I spent the day driving back&nbsp;down to South Carolina.&nbsp; Did I mention it was 9 hours?&nbsp; I got back&nbsp;to the lab around 7pm and got straight to work counting little crab larvae.&nbsp; It's not nearly as fun as it may sound.&nbsp; The vertical migration work I did&nbsp;for Dr. T and Paola was successful.&nbsp; Dr. T. emailed the results to me, and those&nbsp;minax larvae have an almost perfect ebb-tide transport pattern.  &nbsp;  The picture you see is from&nbsp;when I went out to retrieve the light-traps that we lost.&nbsp; We got everything out of&nbsp;the water just as the coast guard came pulling in.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Today was kind of a lax day.&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning I went out to look at Steve's cages again.&nbsp; The crabs we added are not cooperating completely.&nbsp; They&nbsp;continue to attempt to&nbsp;escape the cages.&nbsp; We're hoping they will settle down if we give them enough time to establish themselves. &nbsp; So, mostly today I just drove around the property and took some pictures.&nbsp; The picture you see there is from a road called "King's Highway."&nbsp; I'm sure you can see that it is quite a mighty expressway.&nbsp; However, that road used to be the main&nbsp;route of transportation for this part of the east coast back in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&nbsp; It also just happened to be one of the many&nbsp;major slave&nbsp;trading routes in the country.&nbsp; &nbsp; Alrighty, I'm off to the P.I.T. with the rest of the research team.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Last night was quite an experience.  I Kayaked out to set some traps for larval crabs on a river called the Santee.  So we set two traps to anchors and let them go.  Unfortunately the current was so strong that both of the traps submerged underwater.  Only the faint glow of the light attached to them was visible for about 2 minutes before they dissapeared, never to be seen again.  There was also about 60 ft of rope between the two traps holding them together, so there's quite a underwater hazard out in the middle of the Santee river now.  Ta well!  We eventually just tied 4 traps off to a bridge support and that worked fine.  The five gators that were out in the water with me seemed to approve, as their glowing eyes glided by about 10 meters away.  I let the traps stay out for about 1 hour then retrieved them to find that I hadn't caught 1 larval crab.  Well...I let the WTF's fly!  I'll try again tomorrow night.  The plan today is to round up some more fiddler crabs for Steve's (the PhD student I'm working with) enclosure project.  The high temp today is 97 degrees and you could literally cut through the mosquitoes with a knife.  But, it's all in the name of science.  Stupid science!    Hopefully there will be some waves today.  I need a brain clearing.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Afternoon:  Back from crab hunting.  The mosquitoes are worse than ever.  I think those little bastards are actually waiting for me to exit the car.  Then, instantlythere is that horrible buzzing near your ear.  The plan for tonight is to kayak out under a bridge near here on the Santee river.  We will set light traps in order to catch larval crabs.  If we get enough, I will be able to finally start my vertical migration project.  I was hired for 10 weeks this summer, but my project only takes about 5 days once its started.  The picture is a rental car that Steve (the PhD dude) got while his Civic is in the shop.  Its a Chrysler Pacifica and they start at about $30,000.  If only that company knew what we were doing in their nice luxury SUV/VAN.  Ta well! &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Morning:  This morning I will be going out into the marsh to collect tiny juvenile fiddler crabs with one of the masters students I'm working with (Jenice).  These little guys are about the size of a printed W and are as fast as Marion Jones on steroids...or maybe I should just say...as fast as Marion Jones.    Then I will go out with Steve, a PhD student, to go collect adult sand and mud fiddler crabs to add to his cages.  He's doing a competition study between the two crab types, so he's adding them to cages, and seeing what happens.  However, before crabs can be added the resident crabs must be removed from the cage.  To make this go faster, we are using a wet-dry vac.  Basically, we are just sucking the crabs up and then dumping them into a bucket.  It's actually working pretty well...we haven't had any fatalities...well...not yet at least.  The picture shows that here at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory, we are serious about cleaning up the environment.  It shows Steve vacuuming crabs.  You'd think they'd have a patch or a pill for that by now! &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink         Today I drove three hours to Lumberton, NC to contest a speeding ticket.  The ticket was originally for $150 smackers, but it was reduced down to $110 clams.  So with gas, I probably saved about 20 bucks.  I was going 87 in a 65, but that was nothing compared to another dude there.  He was going 102 in a 65.  His ticket was only $150.  If I had know it was that cheap, I would've gone faster!         However, there was an interesting character in the hallway outside the courtroom.  He was a black guy, about 60 years old.  He had kind of a slanted hi-top fade.  There was a smidge of grey mixed in to his hair.  He was wearing a white long-sleve shirt with blue pin stripes, and a pair of brown slacks.  He also proceded to inform the entire hallway that he was going to "kick the shit out of" the DA (district attorney for those of you that don't watch "The Practice").  Little did he know the DA was in the hallway at the time.  She remained calm, and asked the "gentleman" whether he had a problem she could solve, and the man replied that, "no he had no problem".  Then she quietly replied in a sweet southern accent, "well if it turns out you do have a problem, come see me and I'll have officer Jenkins here solve it for you."  Officer Jenkins was a rather large man that had an aura of "Not to be fucked with" about him.       The picture is from the Baruch Property where I'm working this summer.  It is a lookout tower, and is one of the only structures that survived Hurricane Hugo.&nbsp; urlLink

Allison, congrats on the job, give me a call.  Ki, thanks for hooking me up with this blog crap.  i feel like i'm in the loop :)  also, everyone needs to send me new addresses.  i am going to be sending invitations in the next couple of weeks and if you don't live in the same place we all did in college i have no idea where to send the invites.  talk to you all later.
