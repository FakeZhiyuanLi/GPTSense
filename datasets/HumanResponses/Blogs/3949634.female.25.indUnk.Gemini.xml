       urlLink    Don't Know When I'll Be Back Again&nbsp; urlLink     In Spring 2000, I started a record label called  Exotic Fever Records .  This above photograph is of the last projects I did.  This is a picture if the CD itself, and was quietly released in 2002.  Only quietly because Exotic Fever was still very young at the time and we didn't do much press or promo for it.  However, we had many up and coming, as well as, well established independent artists work on it.  It was sold through some major distributors on the independent level, but was still slow at moving, and out of only 2000, 800 are left now.  So I can save myself the time of typing I will just insert someone else's text about this compilation so that you may understand what this is:      "Catherine Lewis reports: Exotic Fever records has just released a 20-track compilation unwieldily titled Don't Know When I'll Be Back Again: A Compilation to Benefit American Veterans of the Vietnam War. This compilation, which was two years in the making, features Vietnam War-era songs passed through the jaded filters of today's indie-rock stars. Artists like Death Cab for Cutie, J Robbins (Burning Airlines/Jawbox), Q and Not U, and Ted Leo recorded songs by legends like Led Zeppelin, The Stooges, Jimi Hendrix, and Jefferson Airplane, in honor of Vietnam's veterans.   The star-studded compilation benefits the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), an organization which was founded in 1979. According to Bonnie "Deleted name out, you can easily find it" of Exotic Fever Records, the VVA's Benefits Program "provides free legal representation for veterans in front of the Department of Veterans Affairs, assisting them in getting the compensation they need and deserve from disabilities incurred in service." Tracklist:   01 Q and Not U: Don't Let It Bring You Down [Neil Young] 02 J Robbins: Fear is a Man's Best Friend [John Cale] 03 Enon: White Rabbit [Jefferson Airplane] 04 Atombombpocketknife: Immigrant Song [Led Zeppelin] 05 The Caribbean: They Just Can't Stop, Games People Play [The Spinners] 06 Big Heavy Stuff: Hello It's Me [Todd Rundgren] 07 The Reputation: For What It's Worth [Buffalo Springfield] 08 The Gooses: 1969 [The Stooges] 09 Cable Car Theory: Come Together [The Beatles] 10 Leigh Sabol: Me and Bobby McGee [Janis Joplin] 11 Death Cab for Cutie: Fortunate Song [Creedence Clearwater Revival] 12 Panoply Academy: Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag [Country Joe & The Fish] 13 Doiron Wood Guilt Trip: Little Boxes [Malvina Reynolds] 14 John Guilt: Song for the Asking [Paul Simon] 15 Rouge: Happy Together [The Turtles] 16 Dame Fate: There Is a Mountain [Donovan] 17 Jessica Skolnik: Everybody's Been Burned [David Crosby] 18 Tony Dolvin: Taps [Traditional] 19 Beauty Pill: I Don't Live Today [Jimi Hendrix] 20 Ted Leo: Many Rivers to Cross [Jimmy Cliff]"     This compilation is a benefit compilation.  Proceeds go to The Vietnam Veterans of America's benefits department.  Where I worked as a paralegal, where the "real deal get your hands dirty and take care of some shit" work happened.  This is also were I met my husband.  He did the even "dirtier" work of lobbying, writing legislation and testimony for congress.  He worked in the government relations dept.  That's where we fell in love, and what a place for it to happen.   Anyway, I myself had only done a couple of releases before hanging up my towel, at least for a little while.  This was my last one. My daughter Campbell came along, and "surprise!", changed the whole course of my life.  (But not wholly).  I'm due for working on another benefit compilation cd to be produced and released under Exotic Fever Records sometime late fall.  Katy Otto, the woman who now mainly runs the label with another good friend Sara, and I  played several years together in a band (Bald Rapunzel).  Katy and Sara and a couple of other folks have brought this label to a whole nother level.  Which is fantastic!  It still might take a while though to sell the remaining comps.  But we are known for OUR benefit comps.  You may or may not be interested, but its worth checking out at the above link.  I'm tired so more on this label stuff later.   *** reviews for this cd were split, people who liked it loved it, and people who didnt, didnt.  But we got good feedback and for the most part, Im proud as one can be.    P.S.  Im track #15

           This poem was written in 2000 for: W.T.F. (at the time a stranger to me)                                 My American Beauty    My American Dreamer...  In the garden, In her arms , you awoke. You don't think she exists, do you? I want to be at the bottom of a river  that you could see yourself drowning in. Skin enveloped in hushed rushes. Of liquored lips, in the hottest of your August suns. Of parched lips in careful submission  towards quenching the thirst in your mouth.  Bright Eyes - Brilliant and Brown - Wondering over peach hued deserts in pain and pleasure. Still searching in the depths of your disconnection from people and places.  Bitter heart of brutal circumstance; Where is your smile? Such a classic smile, your laugh is a priceless portrait; I don't think you knew that.  My American Beauty... You remind me of the sweetest Spring that I've never had the pleasure of dreaming. Lay in a daze between soft fragrant Hyacinth and Lilac. Every intoxicating breath of moonlight blue shades a beautiful hue over your desolate face. Bringing back a warmth you had once known, maybe in a first kiss somewhere.  You don't think she sees, My American Beauty, Past her own eyes, to look in to yours.  My American Beauty, I couldn't sleep till I put you down on paper.  ______________________________________________________________  -For CBFTW-  Italicized taken from poem years before by said dedicatee (WTF).  Please note that W.T.F. is not CB of CBftw, coicidentally, the persons initials are the same letters.)  This post is about how easy it is to love a person, even if they are strangers.  Since I've found this blog world, I've been meeting and communicating with so many wonderful people (see links, I will also be adding more, I just haven't had the time yet)and I'm thankful.  This is also very true of my experieinces of being a touring musician. That being said, this poem was written on post today for  CBftw  (See,  Soldier, Soldier Everywhere  1st post w/ link to his site as well as side bar " playgroups ").Although this does not necessarily apply to him, I've been thinking about it again, and it is somewhat appropriate.  I pray he will never feel this disconnection when he gets home.   SO here's to all the lovely people I have met since posting!  The universe carries us all to make these connections and to love one another as brother and sister, so that we may live in a better world, and in a loving world for our children to grow in.  P.s.  I've also posted one more comment in Soldier, Soldier everywhere, which was copied off of a link on CB's cite.  Please check it out, and feel free to post other comments in other places, too.  I obviously love the feedback, otherwise I wouldn't be doing this.    P.P.s Picture above is of the ever popular (and noticably so) Vincent Van Gogh's Starry Night.  I believe this was painted in his last Period of painting before commiting suicide.  Chose the picture, because the blue in it matches the blue of this poem.

      ALLIE - My Identical Twin&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink                Ok, so this another thing I cant quite escape.  Her.  She has been following me around everywhere for the last 25 years.  Well, almost everywhere.  Allison, I call her Allie, is my identical twin sister.  Baby A, and you guessed right, I'm baby B.  Named in chronological and alphabetical order.  We are exactly 1 minute apart in age.  We were born in the month of June, 2 months early and premature, so by this happening, we are GEMINI's, as opposed to Leo's.  She will also agree that although she is a minute older, that I am the older one.  No arguing there.  She is my best friend and she pisses me off more than most people.  But, I LOVE HER.  To the very depths that I cant even feel.  We are soul mates.  And when one asks what its like to be a twin, we say, we don't know what its like NOT to be a twin.  Besides the fact that I'm married and have a child and she's not, that I'm a stay at home mom and she's not, and my domain is music, hers is not, everything is the same, everything.  You might say, "Wow, what the hell do you mean everything is the same!?"               She is a glorified all round 6 or 7 year college student (junior).  She is so damn intelligent, but too stupid to see that she is not cut out for school right now. hehe, just kidding.  She really does try and multi task.  She has switched her major from zoology, to kineseology, and I think she is or has switched again or switched previously in between all that -ology crap.  Allie has many interests, and most of that has been spent on athletics.  She is a hard core athlete in the sense that she loves working out at the gym and she loves playing Hockey.  Trying to work and go to school and be bionic woman, has made it so that she still lives at home and is still going to school.  Her goal is still to make it to the Olympics as a Hockey player.  She is damn good, and if she ever blogs, you could possibly check out her resume' if it is included.  Her profile lists in her interests, I kid you not, 5 different ways to say she works out, and I quote "ice hockey, lifting weights, fitness, gymnastics, athletics, dance."  Wait, that's 6.  So you get the point, she has focused on the physical, while I have focused on the emotional.  I sing and write songs, play guitar, piano, and drums.  I was a musician in a few different bands for almost 10 years, and still continue now.  I started a record label, she became a personal trainer.  I went to community college got an AA degree in general studies, and, well, Allie...She's still going to school as previously mentioned.           With all this difference, your still asking where is the common ground?  Well, our major differences, are each others minors so to speak.  Any day we could decide to live each others lives, switch and be equally good at what the other does.  If that makes sense. I work out 3-4 times a week, am still a good gymnast (we use to be acrobats, and paired in acrobatic routines), I can play ice hockey blindfolded, although, I've only been on the ice a couple of times to play...Ok, well not blindfolded, but I can skate as well as someone whose been on the ice for years.  Allie, on the other hand, writes music on the piano and pick up most any instrument and make it sound like she knows what she is doing, and yes she can sing, very nicely in her own style, which varies a little from mine.  We both have the same subject interests in EVERYTHING you can imagine.  We have a "lust for life", as Iggy Pop once said.  WE both love to dance and have started working on dancing together (I can groove, but she can actually claim to have taken classes in her 6 year jaunt at school).  Our past is the same and extensive, but as we grew into teenagers we split paths, but finding we are meeting up again, and happily.  If she ends, I do to.  She wants to get a unique tattoo, where we both would match essentially juxtapose.  But my husband keeps urging me not to, well because to him its simply vanity and very trendy.  However, we are twins and a symbol between us, is a symbol between us, I guess in a way saying that we belong to each other and that there is another half that makes this one whole.  I personally believe that tattoos that have a very symbolic meaning for someone and is unique to that person is just a part of something that is physically inscribed in them and I don't mind.  (I actually have this perspective with decorating a home, i.e. putting up pictures and decorations that look nice, but, well, just aren't you. - I've seen so many tattoos that if I were certain people, I would regret - hopping on the trend for attention that has nothing to do with you, or your beliefs, just like putting on bumper stickers of your so called favorite president elect, only to know that in 4 years you might have to take that shit off, or look like a dumb ass, especially if that president elect didn't win that year.) Anyway, I digress...as usual...Where was I... Allie and I...              We use to spend so much time growing up trying to become individuals, and separate from each other, that we took each other for granted.  But now, we want to look like each other, dance like each other, play music like each other, and do whatever it is we decide in life, to do it together.  Because dammit, we'd be the best success story in the history of the world.  Ok, so I'm exaggerating, but what I mean is, wherever we end up, its got to be together.  We are a balance of each other, of nature, of life.  Ying and Yang.  We are one.  Came from the same egg and everything, which is severely different that fraternal twins, 2 eggs, 2 sperm.  But Allie and I, we have match for match, 100% the same genes.  If you ask of one of my favorite movies, I will say "Dead Ringers."  This is about identical twins and the deep psychology and intertwinedness of two people who cant live without the other.            If you ask her what one of her favorite books are, she will tell you, "This Much I know is True", which is, coincidentally, the same as me, and is coincidentally about Identical TWINS in North East Connecticut.  On this note, I should probably tell you something else.          My husband is an identical twin.  And yes, to get it out of the way, Allie, dated his twin.  So weird and strange as this sounds, it happens I guess.  Anyway, no, they are not together anymore, live too far a part and well, things just sent them to different places, I guess.  But my husband, and his twin, are 8 years older.  Grew up in North East Connecticut (yes, just like the book mentioned previously).  But they were born in Baltimore, which is also where, you guessed, Allie and I were born.  Not the same hospitals, but they were right around the corner from each other, basically.  TO make things even more strange, My husband and I share their parents name respectively, his mom  a Bonnie, and his dad, well they share the same name.  His mother was also a twin, her other half died in womb. Learning more about these coincidence, my husband and I grew up in two completely different places with two completely different lives.  However, both our grandads on our fathers side, were both Navy Chiefs in WWII.  As it thickens they were stationed in to different places, but my grandparents were married in the same New England town that my husband grew up in, and my grandparents weren't from Connecticut, they were from New York and Jersey.  I didn't find this out till after my husband and I were married.  The coincidences keep unraveling, but I'm starting to see double typing all this and its exhausting...  I will probably add more on this post later because I want to keep this for Campbell's record.   Oh, yeah, so I guess that might answer another question.  My husband and I do NOT have twins...and we are ok with that.     Dedicated to Allie - Old Fashioned Morphine (Jolie Holland) Dedicated to my Husband  - With or Without You (U2) and John B Sloop (Beach Boys)

           One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral In my Victorian night-gown.  -   "Morning Song"  -  Sylvia Plath    I'm a nursing momma.  My daughter is almost 2 1/2 years old, and she still nurses.  If you are hearing this and are offended, well I'm sorry you haven't the depth of understanding of what this means.  So let me clarify, "Campbell" (name changed to protect the innocent), is not holding on to my nipple for dear life and nourishment.  I think most people suspect, when they hear me say that she nurses, that Campbell, is soley nourished through mothers milk (and unhealthily dependent).         Nursing is much more like a snack between meals at this age.  But even this has faded.  Its more for an emotional bond with mommy, and a sleep aid at this point.  She "nurses" in the day for mommy time, and nurses at night for a pacifier.  Most people would never have a clue of this, unless I told them or felt they were "safe" enough to nurse Campbell in front of.  Occasionally there is the public milkdown...er, Was that a Freudian slip or what?... MeltDowns (Sorry folks, it came out as I was typing)....Where Campbell will be grabbing at my breast for dear life like someone on fire looking for water.  "I want some milky" she will say.  Sometimes screaming or crying for this mommy time, in places where I don't feel comfortable.  Sometimes when I'm holding her or carrying her, she will try to slip her hand down my shirt and literally grab my breast and try to pull it up for nursing.  This is very comical.  And sometimes, she will just place her hand on my breast, down my shirt for comfort.            What is so funny is that many women in my family and some friends, have been grabbed for some "Milky."  I simply had to explain to Campbell, that when they are mommies they will have milk, too.  She laughs and giggles about it, but she doesn't quite understand yet.  She will still try ever so often to latch on to her Aunt Allie during bath time.  Aunt Allie is my twin.          To explain night nursing, that's another thing.  Campbell is so dependent on nursing to sleep, that ever since she was born, I have not had one wink over three hours continuously.  Well, except for recently, after her first waking she will sleep a longer period of time.  However, she wakes up an hour 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours to have "milky" after first putting her down, then she might sleep for 3 hours tops, followed by the hour 1/2 to 2 hours before she wakes up, where she will remain latched on till waking.  Let me explain why, whenever she awakens, its during a light awakening.  Babies and Tots spend more time in light sleep because their brains are developing, if they were to spend just as much time in deep sleep as adults their growth would be minimal compared to their growth in the first three years.  Along with brain development, much time for babes and tots is spent in light sleep soley for the purpose of survival.  Its amazing to think that the will to survive is embedded so deep within our cells, that its not something we even need to think about.  Truly amazing, being all that babies have when they are fist born are uncontrolled movement and unintelligible vocals.  Their sheer will to survive is beyond any concept that they could ever fathom.         When Campbell was born, she cried much and barely slept.  She was very alert and seemed to be taking so much in that in overwhelmed her.  Many times though, I stressed over the fact that something could be wrong, in the sense that I was projecting that she was never happy.  Or, that I ruined her in womb.  Instead of seeing this as a spirited child, which she truly is and happy at that, I thought there was nothing I could do.  So when it was time for sleep, I nursed her.  This seemed the only thing I could do to get her to sleep.  This was good and bad.  Good, because we both could get some sleep, but bad because it only lasted a very short hour - hour 1/2 before I would have to nurse her back to sleep and usually stay in the same position with my breast in her mouth so that she would stay asleep.  Now, time has passed by and the sleeping stretches are longer, but I'm still not getting enough sleep to be completely rested.  I've trained my baby to depend on my breast for sleep. However, this in no way has made her dependent on me for much else.  She is securely attached, enough to be without me and be with other people.  She is very independent.  People think nursing conceives a needy child.   Quite the opposite is true, the more you let go and give in to their needing you, the sooner they will always trust you to be there, the sooner they will want the hell to get away from you  :)  Seriously, nothing else would do for her - No pacie, no animal, blanket, or anything, just me.  I'm her lovey.          I also realize that time presents itself for everything when all parties are willing to concede.  This is the time.  I know I can now set a boundary, so that I may get more sleep, and so will she, but still be there for her to comfort, hug, kiss, sing, etc (we co-sleep).  I know now that as long as I am "there" for her, allowing her to have her feelings with me, she is safe, cared for, and loved.  She will understand her importance is equal to mine, that my sanity and good mothering is enhanced with sleep.  She is the Center of the Universe, but not the only one in it.   I start tonight.  We have talked for a week or so about it, how when we first laydown to go nite nite that she may have "milky," but when she wakes up anytime after in the night, we will not have it.  But when she sees daylight, she may have milky again.  Cold Turkey is not a good idea.  I've been nursing her way to long to be cruel and stop all at once, plus I want to avoid Mastistitis (sp).  That's breast engorgement.  Very painful.  So each day I will do this until she eventually sleeps althroughout the night, without my help.  Then that should create a domino effect for nursing overall.  So Wish me best wishes!  Here goes for a new chapter for us both.  P.s.  I will be adding links soon under the pseudo and appropriately titled "Playgroups" - these will be the blogs that inspire me, and interest me, the place where this mommy can go to have a sense of community.     P.s.s  More blogs to come on:  TWINS, PUNK ROCK MOMMIES, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION, Exotic Fever,  Campbell stories and lessons I learned from her, and more, something about death, (its something that you think about often once you have children, and let me rephrase, the fear of...When you are young).  I will also be listing music that have been playing around here in this house, as well as shot outs and dedications!

       Without warning, it's the Washington City Paper's superficially revealing inquiry into the musical mind.  Let there be war! MOTOR CYCLE WARS! Yes, the fierce quartet of Jason Hutto (guitar), Jimmy Askew (bass), Clark Sabine (vocals), and Bonnie Schlegel (drums) has descended upon our fair town, hurling fusillades of dangerously high decibels in every direction, luring our youth into wild paroxysms of hedonistic abandon, and, finally, declaring victory. Many of these proud warriors will be familiar to regular readers of the Quiz, makers of the scene, and scrutinizers of the City Paper's masthead. And like other seasoned veterans of musical mayhem, they will, they will rock us. So why fight it? In fact, why not sign on for the cause? This Monday, Jan. 22, Motor Cycle Wars will slay the Dead Teenagers at Galaxy Hut. The show is free. The cost in human lives is incalculable.      urlLink    The Madness&nbsp; urlLink     What equipment do you use and what's your favorite smoke?   CLARK: I don't smoke anymore and I sing, so I just have a little foam thing that goes on the mic so I don't hurt myself.    urlLink    Clark&nbsp; urlLink      JIMMY: I play a cheap-ass bass through a Peavey amp and head. I don't know the specs because I'm not a nerd. And my favorite smoke is second-hand smoke on a cute girl's breath.    BO: Now I wouldn't call it my favorite, but I have been chemically dependent (also ignoring the power of will to stop) on cigarettes for about six years, maybe seven, and the majority of the time it's been the Cowboy Killers (Marlboro Reds). It used to be Camels, Newports, and some other brand...and not necessarily in that order.    HUTTO: My fingers smoke when I play my D.C.-issue Gibson SG. I really shred, you see.     What kind of drums do you play and what pets do you own?   CLARK: I have four fish I saved from an above-ground pool at a 9:30 Club staff party last year.    JIMMY: I have The Sims.    BO: I use the drums, that were formerly Jason's...I'm not sure what kind they are. It's red. And the kick pedal almost matches, because my toe bled all over it when I wasn't wearing any shoes a few days ago. I will take credit for Clark's fish, because I invited him. Otherwise, he'd be short four friends...Winken, Blinken, Nod, and Stanley. (Names have been changed to protect the little bastards.) Just joking...they are really cute and they can tell the best stories.     urlLink    Bo&nbsp; urlLink     HUTTO: I play a mean set of drums, and sometimes when pouring a nice bowl of Honeycomb, I notice Mr. Wacky-wing, the stub-winged crow, hanging out in our backyard. My roommate Kim feeds him bagels, and to show his appreciation, he brings us jewels he steals from McLean. Cool damn bird.     What's your favorite D.C. hangout and your favorite automobile?    CLARK: Galaxy Hut is my watering hole, and I don't really like cars that much...    JIMMY: The Hut. Hands down. Sorry everybody else.    BO: I think it would have to be the Galaxy Hut, but I'm footbound now, so I'd probably have to say our house...    HUTTO: Yes, the Galaxy Hut. Clark's mom pays Jimmy and I a lot of money to be friends with Clark. The Hut is a safe place to let him run free. He loves it. Also, no truck can get me and my friends to the Galaxy Hut in more style than my '85 Nissan pickup with king cab and camper shell. "My Nissan truck can really go the miles."     What's the worst place you've crashed and the worst haircut?    CLARK: I went to a place called "Oh's" hairstyling in Shirlington this past year and got a feathered, mouse-filled, 1980s, six-inch pompadour. I think I looked pretty HOT, actually...   JIMMY: Once I got a buzz-cut when I was 8. This was way before they were cool and my shit got mocked. I slept in my garage once because I lost my keys.   CLARK: Hey, I slept in a garage once, too...    BO: I don't get bad haircuts, just bad people. Once, when I was 14 or 15, I snuck out of my house, and I couldn't sneak back in because I think someone was still up. So I slept outside on a lawn chair underneath the deck in my parents back yard...except there was no crashing about it. It really sucked and eventually I got in somehow...I don't even remember.    HUTTO: I had a crew-cut in 10th grade that turned into a flat-top and, eventually, a full-blown mullet by 11th grade. I was really into the "wet look." My grandma wasn't really into my gelled hair or my acid-washed jacket and pants that I wore every day. She said they were ugly. The old don't know.   urlLink    Jason&nbsp; urlLink      Worst roommate and best audience?    CLARK: I lived with this guy in Orlando, Fla., who used to change the oil in his motorcycle in our living room, hang bed sheets with bad words written all over them on the walls, and thought he was Eddie Vedder.    Best audience, in this band, was at our Galaxy Hut show. Everyone got involved and that was really fun.   JIMMY: I live alone. Our best crowd was the one at Black Cat because there were so many people who had never seen us and who were actually shocked, as opposed to the kids who are used to us by now. It was fun to watch them go, "Whoa! This shit is nuts!"    BO: Best audience, I'd have to say, was at Catholic U. Or that's where I had the most fun playing, and then the Black Cat show. So it looks as though out of the four or five shows we've played, all of them have been our best audience.    HUTTO: I hate brown crickets. I lived in this dump where the bathroom was also the shower. There was a shower head coming out of the wall by the door and a drain in the floor under the sink. When I'd shower, I'd notice all these goddamn spiky brown crickets circling around me. staring at me. Them goddamn bug-eyes. Definitely the best audience.     Explain your band name and define your sound.    CLARK: I still don't know what our band name means. Ask Jimmy, he came up with it. Our sound is really low-key and not really thought out. We start to play, find a flavor, and just go.   JIMMY: Dude, the name was all Hutto. I was pushing for Chickenhawks UK. Our sound is, umm, Swamp-Rock.    CLARK: Oh, I thought it was you...    BO: Chickenhawks UK? Thank God the name was all Hutto. Jimmy, do we even play in the same band?    HUTTO: In Arkansas, the highlight of many a youngster's year is when the monster trucks come to Barton Coliseum in Little Rock. Halftime entertainment during this exhaust spectacular is Motorcycle Wars! This is when there's no less than 70 motorcycles jumping and flying all over the goddamn place. It'll set you free.     What clothes do you like to wear on stage and what do you eat on the road?   CLARK: I'm not answering, my mom could be reading this...   JIMMY: Layers, so that I can shed them as I get warmer. I eat fried food on the road. Actually, I eat fried food everywhere.    BO: Christmas Lights. Nothing else. I haven't done that yet, but I think I will get Clark or Jimmy to do that, and I'll take the Hunters (tiger-striped underwear that Clark favors live)...don't worry, Clark, I won't tell your mom about you and your (Aussie accent) "This is the world's most deadliest snake and I'm going to stick my head in its mouth" drawers.    HUTTO: My fashion theme as a rock star is a garage worker who happens to play guitar. Just like Elvis did in so many excellent movies. I feel our blue-collar crowd can really relate to that. My mom taught me that carrots are an excellent snackable road food that's fun and nutritious.     What are your influences and worst equipment experience?   CLARK: I smacked myself square in the forehead with the microphone once at a show. I had mic-grill marks for three days...    JIMMY: I tore my right hand open on my bass and bled through the whole show. It was actually kinda cool. Oh, once I blew our old head during our first song and had to play our whole set through a practice amp.    urlLink    Jimmy&nbsp; urlLink      BO: I wouldn't exactly call it worst equipment experience, but usually every show, I develop a bruise on my thigh the size of a football from my snare hand beating down on it. Its hard to walk after that.    HUTTO: All instrument cords are the root of evil. They love to tangle and mate and get all spaghettilike around my neck and arms and legs. Geez. Then I get all mad and the room gets hot, 'cause I'm tripping and knocking everything over.   Tony Robbins is a powerful influence. He is my financial advisor and golf buddy.     What's your favorite tour memory and worst band squabble?   CLARK: We tour in May(?). Jimmy and Bonnie got into it once before a show. It was really funny. We generally never fight.   JIMMY: I love Bonnie and she loves me.    BO: It was me against the three of them. I wanted to set my drums on the ground stage instead of the riser (it's scary up there without my crew). Well, it wasn't really like a band squabble, nor was it like all of them against me, either, but it was a disagreement—that we resolved and I won. :) Well, we all won. I would have been a wreck if I stayed up there—then the squabble really would have been on.    JIMMY: I think Clark was talking about my obsessive need to be on time for everything, Bo.    HUTTO: Wow, my favorite tour memory was when me and the family were touring San Diego in '79 and I stood before the Pacific Ocean on Dog Beach. The seagulls above the white-caps rose to a great height and then formed a perfect circle in flight. I had no idea I was walking on water as the seagulls harmonized in unison their strange beautiful song. I awoke in Anaheim a day later during a frightening ride through the Hall of Presidents in Disneyland. I'll never forget Lincoln. I hear Aerosmith was going through some bad times in those days, too.     What's your transpo and what's the worst place you've ever dropped trou?   CLARK: Jason's pick-up truck gets us to the shows. When is it ever not a good time to drop them drawers.   JIMMY: Hutto's truck, my Escort. Once I went potty in the worst pay toilet in Scotland.    BO: Jason's truck. I hate public restrooms, altogether. They are the worst.    HUTTO: We all agree again. I also like to pinch a loaf in my truck. I had no idea you other guys did, too.     What's the stupidest move your singer ever pulled?    CLARK: This should be interesting...   JIMMY: Well, he once jumped in the fountain at Clarendon Park during our third-to-last song, and then realized after he was soaking wet that we had two more numbers to go. OOPS!   CLARK: It's not like it was planned. But, yes, we did have two more songs...and it was really cold.    BO:  God, there's so many of them. :) Well, there was the time when Clark did some ballerina move into my kit and my set went everywhere, including the kick pedal that got contorted and completely broke right out of its holder. (Clark, you owe me, biatch.) Anyway, he did the ballerina move just about every show and screwed something up each time. I just laugh. It's more stupid than funny haha. Haha.     There was also a classic move at the Black Cat show, when Clark was trying to be all slick with the mic, and he took himself right out in the center of his forehead...the mic grill marks were funny. At the Catholic U show, Clark's dumb ass crawled out of the window behind us while we were playing (I do believe we have a picture), and one of the Dead Teenagers locked it right before he was coming back in and he was stuck out there for a minute or so. That was pretty funny, too. On that note, I love my boys; got me laughing all the time.   JIMMY: Hey, can I thank God for our continued success somewhere?   [Ed: No.]   HUTTO: I think when Clark tried going solo back in '98 backed by former members of Mr. Big. We all knew he was trying to wrap his pain in glory, but all he did was was wrap his pain in half-filled halls and lousy drum solos. Now that he's back with the band that made him a star, I've never seen him happier. I feel like now we are at the top of our game. We have become one badass rock machine fueled by the love of our fans and the respect that we have for our each other and...ourselves

      Jason Huddo, Jimmy Askew, Clark Sabine, Erik Denno, Ryan Nelson, and Ann Jagur.  Here's to memory's.  I pray I never have Alzhiemers.  My grandfather is stricken by this awful awful disease.  More on that later. To contimue, I thought we were originally the Motorcycle Warriors, but I think it was always said so fast, that people just thought we said "Motorcycle Wars."  Anyway...This Blog is in thoughtful remembrance of Jason Huddo, Jimmy Askew, and Clark Sabine.  We were quite a team, but it just got complicated with a 5th member, my daughter. I was 3 months pregnant when I stopped playing drums for this crazy band.  I believe the Dead Teenagers (our rival band) think they had one on us, but they pretty much stopped playing when we did. Ha!  Anyway, this is in fond remembrance of them as well.  Erik Denno, Ryan Nelson, and Ann Jagur.   Here is the only picture I knew I could find of myself on the internet.  The infamous  Motorcycle Wars .  DC based, and beloved although short lived.  It should make for a pretty interesting read.  You should read past archives as well. There are some really good ones.

         Well, I just set up this thing...And I have nothing to say right now.&nbsp; I've spent years having a clue about computers, but literally this took me awhile.&nbsp; Not because I didn't get it, but trying to chase after a little one while&nbsp;setting up is like watching a pingpong game.&nbsp; And sometimes it was almost like trying to solve a puzzle, how I got a picture to post for this new post, but no picture in my profile, and that took me quite a while to figure.&nbsp; Anyway, I was inspired to do this blog by one other fellow blogger, whose entries were so fantastic.&nbsp; This guy is an excellent writer.&nbsp; He is soldiering in Iraq, and it has been like reading a letter from a good friend.&nbsp; apolitical, &nbsp;just pure human experience.&nbsp; This guy writes alot like my husband (who has been working on&nbsp;his novel for over five years).&nbsp; However, my husband was a combat veteran of the first gulf war, so&nbsp;it was somewhat like reading his experiences.&nbsp; God, they all have these twisted, demented but&nbsp;hilarious stories...I mean in the way that they are explained.&nbsp; Anyway, here's the other guys BLOG  "My War Fear and Loathing in Iraq" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink http://www.cbftw.blogspot.com/ &nbsp; I'm so tired, I don't feel like writing, nor am I giving this guy the proper credit due, see for yourself.&nbsp; Interesting, &nbsp;a soldier that likes punk rock. Also on the soldier note, check out the tragic story, entitled a Soldiers Girl or visit www.Calpernia.com.&nbsp; This woman is amazing, considering all that she has been through.  Based on a true event in 1999.  You can also read her book entitled   MARK 947  .  She was also a gulf war veteran.   Anyway, Ill try this again tomorrow, when I'm not feeling dead.

      I love my grandfather...But really only because he is blood.  If it weren't for him and a mix of other things, I would not be here.  And I love my dad.  This, obviously is my father's father.  They, G-ma & G-pa S, have lived in Florida (the retirement state) for almost all their lives now.  So growing up in MD, we did not see them much. This is where they were originally from, but I guess when you get older the whether gets colder.   So we (my sibs and I) have known them from vacations every year to the sunshine state.  We would have such a good time relaxing, swimming, lots of soda, ice cream and most importantly, because the lack of in our house growing up, delicious home cooked meals.  We loved our grandparents, they were good to us, and we were very affectionate with them, said "I love you"...But we mostly were off on our own.  Whenever we were around though, our grandfather would lovingly tell us about the first day of our lives, when he held us.  My twin sister and I would fit very snuggly in each arm. He would then stretch his arm out and point with his finger of the opposite  hand, "Your head would be here, and your feet ended before they touched the crevice of my arm."  I was 4 lbs 9 oz, and Allie was 3lbs 9 oz.  14 inches long, and 12 inches long, respectively.  We were tiny.  We would hear this every visit, but in my grandfathers words we'd hear the love and pride in his voice of his first grandchildren, along with a quite cute picture of Allie and I in 24 pack Michelob box as little babes (this was only for the sake of showing how small we really where, no alcoholics here, at least not on this side).    Over the last several years, we would hear this story once or twice within a couple hours.  Every visit.  That wasn't the only story - among several.  The worst one to hear was how my grandfather, when first getting back from his tour in World WarII, came home to my grandmother smoking a cigarette.  He then picked up her pack of cigarettes, tossed them out the window and said, "If I catch you smoking any more of these, I'm gonna throw you out the window."  My grandfather loves his wife and he would tell this story in front of her.  Granted this incident happened over 60 or so years ago -It never ceases to amaze me: he still never lost the suaveness of being such a chauvinist.  'What an Ass,' I would say to myself.  But I loved him still, all the while feeling sorry for my grandmother.   Fast forward 5 or 6 years to now.  My grandparents are both visiting my family in Maryland.  Here lives both parents, twin sis, younger brother and younger sis.  I am visiting with Campbell while husband is in Connecticut. He stopped by here last night on the way home, so he only slightly added to the three ring circus.  Think of Wagner's  Ride of the Valkyries   or anything by Wagner playing, this is what it seems like here.  My parents are working on getting my grandparents a new place to live.  With the rate of deterioration of my grandfathers brain and the fact that no one is in Florida to help them - everyone (parents and g-parents) thought it best to move them up here and into an assisted living community.  Pretty much a place where they can have autonomy, but also have the health care needed, and be not far from family.  It has taken months and still a little time now trying to convince my grandfather, that he is not going to a "Hospital."  Every day is a reminder about the forgotten conversation held the day before, where after a couple of hours it seemed to "Sink in" that he understood.  Only to start over again the following day.  Much yelling out of frustration, crying by my grandfather about the loss of his memory and everyone trying to convince grandpa that he just no longer has much control over things.  Its so hard to see what is really just an 83 year old man, and what is Alzheimer's.  The worst part about all of this, aside from convincing him to relinquish more control to others for the sake of his well being, is the comments about things here.  Particularly, his grandchildrens friends.    My younger brother and sis, have a very good mix of friends from Trinidad, Guiana,  as well as a handful of white and black kids, Hispanic, and Asian - some American born, some not.  My parents home has been a home for all of our friends - my mom has been the mother in a way to all these different kids.  Me and my sis Allie have also had so many friends that varied race, and ethnic background, culture. You get the point.  Everyone is welcome here, and my mom loved them and would often help too much to the point of enabling.  But our home was a melting pot, free of any bs.  As long as people were good to one another, they were allowed to be here.  So people are here, friends of my sibs as well as friends of mine.  But my grandfather will come up to each one of us, and comment in various points of the day about the people who are here till sometimes three in the morning, or comment about how they are going to steal stuff, or about if one of the girls sleeps with one of these guys, the baby will be ugly. Etc, etc...The funny thing is my grandfathers opinions are not only stupid, they are ignorant.  He thinks everyone with darker skin is "black."  As if they have no other identity, race, culture, etc..  Its annoying to listen to him, and even more of a pointless frustration to try and tell him,  "No one is having sex!", "The world we live in today, the opposite sex can still hang out together and just be friends", "These are people, grandpa, people who we know!" "these are human beings, no different or better or worse than the rest of us, and on and on.  After awhile, it as if he knows the things he says are wrong or hurtful, and begins to feel bad.  He apologizes for being messed up in the head.  Again I don't know how much of this is him and how much is the head disease.    But I've heard the worst comes out in people.  Maybe not in all, but I've heard more than not, that Alzheimer's can be a living hell.  And Its embarrassing and I just don't want to be around him and cant wait till he leaves.  My grandmother is fine for the most part - and just says, "ignore him, that's what I do."  I think whatever state my grandfather is in, it almost reverts him back to another time, as he would say, "when I grew up,..." There was segregation, it was women (and only women) that were considered promiscuous (if they hung around the opposite sex and were not dating, they were sleeping around), ..."I cant do nothin no more", or "I use to have hundreds of men under me as a Navy Chief, and at NIH...Now I cant do anything."    I don't know if I'm giving a complete picture of him, but my grandfather is not able to come to terms that he is not capable of physically doing much because of age and his disease.  This is something that is argued about so often.  I feel bad.  My grandparents have nothing to do, but sit around and do nothing.  My grandfather takes several naps a day.  It is truly unfortunate that they have nothing that seems to bring them joy.  No hobbies, no friends, nothing but the stillness of time passing without you.        So they are going on Friday to check this Assisted living place.  I hope they are going to live in this place.  They can get the help they need and hopefully be able to make friends and have things to do.  I think part of the problem of many things with my grandparents, is that they have been isolated...From many things that stopped any growth in many areas that could have improved their lives.     Not to mention the sooner they get in, the sooner they are out of my parents house, which is stressing everyone out.  Including me and I don't live here anymore.  I'm all the sudden apart of everything that is wrong with my sibs friends, as if I have anything to do with what goes on here.  My ex boyfriend and his wife where here with a couple of other friends the other day, and my grandfather completely went back into his "anger/disappointed mode" about who we all hang with.   Not seeming to realize that I have my own family in another state, and I'm married, and so is my exboyfriend, who I'm am wonderfully good friends and his awesome wife.  My grandfather is "Blurring" my twin sis, my self and my younger sister together, as if he is talking to the same person about the same problem.  I'm like "grandpa, I'm Bonnie, remember I have a husband and a daughter, I dont live here."  This is giving me a headache writing this, but this is on my mind and its making me feel crazy.   So maybe all of this doesnt make sense right now, but im not seeming to have the space to focus on this completely. so whatever...hope thi smakes sense on some level

          Such a pretty blossom, only lasts for about a couple hours at most maybe, before it starts to wilt and die.  The fragrance of this flower is delicious, very deep, but subtle.  Reminds me of my dear friend Amanda's perfume.  The perfume was called McLintock.  I think.  I could be wrong.  This is a memory from high school when myself and another best friend pretty much lived at her house. This scent reminds me of that time, of carefree nonsense.  The plant continues to grow, but the bloom passes very quickly.  I got home from the store with Campbell, when I noticed the neighbors, all 4 of them, just staring at the ground all huddled together on their front step like they were watching a worm die in the evening sun.  It wasn't a worm though, it was a Moon flower plant that they moved to a new location so that it could get more sun.  Apparently, it looked much healthier when in more sunlight, than in not. But it will only bloom in the evening, then fold back up to its immediate ending with a kiss from the morning sun.    There was one lonesome bloom, a beautiful long, white bud that untwines itself as it opens.  When Campbell and I went over to have a look, we just stared for about 10 minutes.  There was a ruler placed under this bloom so that you could watch the measurement of it widen as it blossomed.  You didn't need a ruler though.  It's petals were clearly, and visibly moving.  Like one of those Disney/TLC shows that recorded a flowers growth on a camera in a matter of days, but when they post it to a program, you watch a bloom unfold, or fold back up in a matter of 30 seconds.  That was this flower, but in real time.    Standing back a good 4 or 5 feet, you could watch this flower, in all its splendor, twitch, vibrate, and shake a little as it opened its face to the world.  This was unreal, I stood in awe.  This was just a flower before I watched, but was a living thing that spoke to me as I stood there.  I wanted to say, "Thank you, gorgeous Moon Flower."  And then, I realized, that might sound a little silly, and the neighbors might look at me like I'm wierd. (more about that later).   But when watching this, it had something to say to me.  At least, this is the way in which God speaks to me.

      Its so funny how now that I am a mom I just can't listen to all the heavy and harder stuff I use to listen to.  Especially, when Campbell is listening.  Here's a list of some thing we can, right off the top of my head.   1.   Beach Boys   - Pet Sounds  2.   Elizabeth Mitchell's (of Ida)  solo album - You are my Sunshine 3.  Any album from  U2  4.  Any song from  Sara Harmer  5.   The Be Good Tanya's  - Blue Horse 6.  Any song from  Jolie Holland  7.  Anything from  Cold Play  8.   Cat Power's  - You are free 9.  Most anything from  Aimme Mann  10. Any of the following: Blues, Jazz, Classical (any period), Swing, Bluegrass, some funk, various instrumental, almost any soundtrack I own, and some hiphop (mostly Outkast).  I could be missing some, and this could also change.  That's motherhood.  Presently though, the most music we listen to together is in the car, about 45 various mix tapes, but mostly the VA Tech Radio station which is excellent, and that is a good mix of various punk, indie rock, jazz, funk, folk, hiphop, electronic, random stuff, etc. - The list that most College Stations have, but this is truly a great radio station.  I'll re-edit if I think of more.    My husband on the other hand, will put on 1.  Tom Petty (This I don't mind) 2.  Metallica (This sounds just scary to me if I was a little girl) 3.  U2 4.  Lynyrd  Skynyrd 5.  Led Zeppelin (I do Love Led Zeppelin though, just not always so listenable with your daughter) 6.  Alice in Chains 7.  Smashing Pumpkins 8.  Foo Fighters 9.  Random from Aerosmith, Pearl Jam, Pink Floyd, Chevelle, REM, Elizabeth Mitchell.  Sometimes I say, "Do you have to play this stuff?", followed by "It just sounds so dark and negative and a downer on the psyche, ya know"   I will clarify though, that this is what he mostly listens to when working out (with the exception of Elizabeth Mitchell.)  His response "Whatever, Campbell likes it."  'Yeah, right' I think to myself, just like I like to bang my head against the wall, and run a hot iron over my foot.  Anyway, who knows, she might like it.  I just know the feeling I get when I hear certain things.  I just want to hold my hands over her ears.  Tangent...Speaking of holding hands over ears.  I thought "Old School" was hilarious.  Vince Vaughn with the kid.  If we all could just do this, so the kids wouldn't hear.

      * This was copied word for word from ALa71's Blog.  Very poignant and Beautiful.  It only made sense to post it here, too.  Entitled because this is what I think "The Movie" of this story would be appropriately titled.  (To be honest, the movie  Butterfly Effect  was cheesy, but interesting nonetheless about the whole scheme of life.  And so it goes, as redundent as it may seem for those of you who saw the movie.  This theory has been around long way before the movie.) According to the Chaos theory, pressented was a question: "Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?" so on that note... Here is her post:  His War: Our Soldier     FOX NEWS: ANCHOR-We are getting reports of a car bomb that has gone off in Baghdad –tentative reports say it may be in front of a Christian Church…wait we are getting the first pictures. The smoke looks very black, can this really be a car bomb or was a fuel station hit?  REPORTER-No, this is a car bomb –they have gotten very good at making them out here.  ME: That’s was CB said the other day.  HUSBAND: Yeah, I know.  SISTER: Who is CB?  ME: He’s our soldier…    Mine, justrose’s, ~Jen~’s, 91Ghost’s, EXFBonnie’s, ThisWe’llDefend’s (the list is endless)….he has become ‘our soldier’, and many of us are here because we started reading his site and ours evolved from there.   Fox News: Anchor:We are also getting reports there was a bomb in Mosul…    My heart sinks…I will be checking every hour to see if CB posted now. How did this stranger become such an important part of my life? I have been thinking about this all day as I fretted over the fact that he has yet to post at 10pm EST. What if something happened to him? How will we know? Do his parents know about the site? His wife?   No matter what our politics of origin, those of us who flock to his site -(for the most part) leave them behind there. It is a sanctuary from the vitriol. There we don’t care so much if it’s Bush or Kerry –we only care to know that he’s OK and that he continues to feed our addiction to war-real-time. Maybe somewhere deep down we all feel guilty (stateside guilt I always say)…if we read each and every day we are involved –invested even.    JUSTICE: Mom, I want to see what CB looks like.  ME: You can’t, he can’t put his picture up.  JUSTICE: You have yours there.  ME: I am not at war.    Sometimes I feel like we are all being selfish –maybe not consciously, but selfish none-the-less. We want confirmation to validate our point of view… “See he says that he is mad at Bush for stop-loss…” “No see, he said that he thinks it would be a slap in the face to vote for Kerry…” and so on...   I notice reading the posts that many try to slip in their views --scantily veiled in ‘concern’…”CB, I am undecided, but vote Kerry so maybe you can home quicker.” In some small way maybe we all want him to justify all that we have said-- for or against the war.    ME: Dad, have you read the soldier blog that is linked to my site yet?  DAD: It takes me long enough to read everything on yours.  ME: Read his instead then, you will love it…read his. Ya know what he said the worst pick up line in Iraq is?  DAD: What?  ME: Are you a terrorist, cause you da bomb….    Here is a person that I have never met…a person who has no first name…no face…yet a friend. His words have become so familiar –so anticipated. He seems to be the embodiment of all that is good in this country. A hero….yet he is often blunt, disgruntled…and human. A visitor to his site once pointed out that the ‘hawks’ were overlooking glaring signs that say, “Anti-war” –the painting choice, the link to Hunter Thompson…but I think that’s what I find so wonderful. He seems mad about the war sometimes –yet the next day touched by a gesture from a local. He listens to SOD, but reads Hunter Thompson. He comes from a republican family –yet contemplates a vote for Nader.   ME: Do you think more than one person writes CB’s page?  JUSTROSE: Why?  ME: Because he just doesn’t make sense. Hunter Thompson said that he would rip off the heads and piss down the neck of this Nazi administration….  JUSTROSE: No, it’s just him…   I disagree with those who constantly tell him to go to school for writing/journalism. Academia will steal his edge and attempt to reign in his raw talent and passion. His writing is real and prompts many of us to respond with words of comfort and well-wishes each day.  The things that many of us say/want to say to him –“We are proud of you”, “Stay safe”, “Thank you for what you are doing”…seem to ring hollow typed in the comments section of the blog…but I know they are all truly from each person’s heart.  There is no figuring this soldier out –and that’s why he is everyone’s soldier…he is our soldier.  *For anyone that hasn’t read CBFTW’s site –please do at http://cbftw.blogspot.com/
