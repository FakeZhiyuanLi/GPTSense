      I HAVE HAD 3 OF THE BEST NIGHTS OF MY LIFE!  WOW is all i can say.  I have no way to explain it.  just incredible.  I love me.  The concert was so incredible!  Wow.    What could possibly be any better than ABK, Twiztid, a surprise appearance by the one and only VIOLENT J, and being in the arms of some of the people that mean the most to me in my life.  There were a few missing pieces but the concert was orgasmic.  ABUH to the past few nights.

      I love how when she smiles or laughs and when her eyes light up and how her ears perk up just a little bit.  Makes me smile every time but I dont think she knows that.  I love how I can make her nervous even if I dont do anything to cause that.  I love how she trusts me more than anything and how no matter how hard I fight her trust means the most to me.  I love how she asks questions and is curious about what is going on in my mind.   I love how she cares so much about me.  I love how she gives me great big hugs and she always knows when to give them.  I love how she comes to me to talk about anything.   I love how she throws away her friday nights just to hang out with me.  I love the way her eyes speak and how they are so incredibly beautiful.  I love how she calls me in the middle of the night just to talk for no apparent reason.  I love how she lets me tuck her in at night.  I love how incredibly wonderful she is and full of life.  I love how happy she is when I walk in the room.   I love how she means so much to me and I know I mean a lot to her too.  I love how she tells me she loves me all the time.  I love how we are such great friends and never get sick of each other.  I love how we can watch movies together in complete silence and still know what the other is thinking.    I love that she knows me so well that I dont even have to use words to tell her how I feel or what Im thinking.  I love how she says that I am whipped and then I tell her I'm not and then she proves me wrong all the time.  I love how the more time I spend with her the better friends we become and the more I learn about her.  I love how the more I learn about her the more I love her.  I love how with our crazy schedules we still find time for a quick hello or a hug.    I love how I am lucky enough to have a great friend like her.  I love how this list will never end.  I love you.

      My dad dropped me off and I walked in that store yet again to look for some more things to help me with my project and to see my good friend.  I walked all over the store looking for her.  I found her on the second time around helping some lady out with some crafty paper.  She looked up and smiled a little shocked but still happy and all cute.  I hung around in another isle waiting for her to be done but then I heard her name over the P.A. asking her to return to her register.  So i was in search of my crafts all by myself.  I went and stood in her line and i watched her do the usual "how are you today? did you find everything you needed?" to the customer ahead of me.  Then it was my turn and she looked up with those beautiful blue eyes and in a shy sheepish way she said "hey baby" very softly so only I could here.  I laughed a bit and said hello.  She rang up my items and we chatted about hanging out tonight and how our days were.  Then she handed me my change and my receipt and gave me a smile.  we kept talking for a bit while she was ringing up the next person.  I headed off and she kept smiling and then i yelled for her to have a great night and she laughed and said "haha you too".  Wow she's haat.  I love her so much.  Shes one of the bestest people I know and a great friend!  SHE RULES!

      Sometimes seeing someone in a completely different light without the background noises of rumors really makes them glow.  why do people have to care so much about other people's lives and business?  I know if I pursue this that people will talk and act and treat me differently. I dont know why people have to act this way.  Im only going to do what makes me happy and what is in my heart.  Just because they see this person differently than i do doesnt mean that they are right and i am wrong.  But you know what these people can talk all they want and try to make my life miserable and if they succeed well i hope they feel good about it.

      Here are all my old diarys they will have the date with them.  I just wanna make sure I dont lose them again.  August 15, 2003-11:50 p.m.   So yea I have some exciting news I guess!   I just ordered 3 incredibly awesome jazz books for alto Hell yes! Im so excited!   Also my parents have decided to get the piano tuned and fixed and that means more lessons for me! fun fun!    Also even more weird and exciting news, my parents said yes to hosting a spanish girl here for the beginning of school!    Weird my parents are going through a change! My mom keeps talking about me growing up and going to college and being way better off than my three brothers and to keep doing what im doing and not to worry about anything else. I think they are worried about me leaving. Its not for another two years. I probably shouldnt keep scaring them with this California talk. I know my brother wants me to stay in Mass so he can go to college with me and we could possibly live together with the juggalos as a big family or maybe just the two of us. i dont know how well he would do without me. Or the rest of the guys for that matter. I guess it kinda stinks for him because hes the youngest. I worry about him sometimes in situations like these. I know he will be fine but it wont be easy. But thats life for ya. Hey at least I know he wants to go to college and follow me somehow. At least I know he loves me and I love him too. Hes the best brother and friend in the world. And its actually funny that im saying this tonight because recently with the large family at the funeral and wake, a lot of people were commenting on us getting along so well at such a young age. They say we are lucky and now that I think about it they are right. We are. I have one of my best friends living downstairs. Maybe someday he will get his dream of us all living together in the future. Maybe it will be just me and him. who knows. We are only in highschool and I have 2 years left. Why worry about it now? Although it is nice to think about at times. there are my thoughts for right now.   August 13, 2003-2:30 p.m.   DISPATCH- HEY HEY   Well I'm moving kind of slow   Down that same old path   Wasting time inside this hour glass   She's coming up ahead now   And I feel, yes I feel   My head turning like a race car wheel   Maybe I'll try to say hi another time   I've gotta find a way to get inside your mind   I'll talk smoothe and walk one step closer   Be real cool, dang real cool    say what you want, say what you mean   question yourself, are you really what you seem?   say who you are, say what you mean   question yourself, are you really what you dream?    now here I come one more time   but she slides on by   not even a second look   she took the bait right off that hook   I've got my blinders on tight   I pull my cap a little lower   I can't hide away    you might think that this is easy for me   but there's a lot of things you don't know   you don't care, you don't want to see   long while since I've got myself across   but maybe there's a reason for that   even if I caught you I'd throw you back.    say what you want, say what you mean   question yourself, are you really what you seem?   say who you are, say what you mean   question yourself, are you really what you dream?    hey... hey...    I really don't want to fall back   because you don't seem like you care   and if I would fall back   you don't seem like you care   and if I would fall back   you don't seem like you care    fall down your back, fall down your back   fall down your back, fall down your back    I will not, I will not hold, hold you back   you don't seem like you care    Fall back... you don't   Fall back... you don't   Fall back... you don't    August 12, 2003-12:17 p.m.   SIMPLE PLAN - ADDICTED   I heard you're doin' OK,   But I want you to know   I'm a dick,   I'm addicted to you   I can't pretend I don't care   When you don't think about me   Do you think   I deserve this?

The next morning alan woke me up and the tent was wet and we were all soaked...it wasnt that bad tho it leaked in from the sides.....i woke up and alan went back to sleep after waking me up at the crack of dawn.....i went out of the tent and picked up all the remainders of the cans and bottles of faygo and then sat down for some peace and quiet.....a few minutes later steve came out of the tent and we ate breakfast together....then he walked me to the bathroom and on our way back it started downpouring so we quickly jumped in the van and were thinking of driving away...next thing we knew it was a few hours later and everyone else was awake....we had fallen asleep.....saturday wasnt very eventful...we had a fire going all day and cooked and ate most of the day....we all went kyaking and basically just chilled out happy to be together.....at night sitting around the fire we all took turned smoking a very great strawberry cigar.....just being together happy all sharing the moment...words did not need to be spoken....the next morning we awoke 2 hours later than we planned and then packed everything up and were on our way home....we had a great time....

Monday i had to work from 10 - 3 30....so it was a long day and i was very tired....katie came over and we hung out most of the night just chillin we played some volleyball and football and that was fun.....then i drove katie home and then went to watkas because i wanted to surprise heather when she got home around 11 30....we were all so tired that we all went to bed pretty early.....   heather and i didnt wake up till 11 45 and that was only because i had to go home and get my medicine....so i went home took my meds and went back to the watkas!...then we ordered pizza and then heather and i went upstairs to listen to music and we fell asleep....i woke up and had to hurry home to get ready for soccer....i wasnt feeling very well at all so soccer wasnt all that fun....everyone was in a lazy mood tho....around 10 chris dropped loo loo and heather off and we watched the end of osmosis jones and we watched Ice Age.....then chris came back and picked them up and they went home.....then after a few hours of downloading Eva Cassidy and talking to chris...i got kicked offline and went to bed...

Why was it that in cases of real love the one that is left does not more often follow the beloved by suicide? Only because the living must bury the dead? Because of the measured rites that must be fulfilled after a death? Because it is as though the one who is left steps for a time on stage and each second swells to an unlimited amount of time and he is watched by many eyes? Because there is a function he must carry out? Or perhaps, when there is love, the widowed must stay for the resurrection of the beloved - so that the one who has gone is not really dead, but grows and is created for a second time in the soul of the living? Why?   -The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers pg.104    July 21, 2003-10:42 p.m.   hello everyone....   HAPPY BIRTHDAY WHIT!

July 17, 2003-7:54 p.m.   heyyyyy   2003-07-17-7:12 p.m.   This is a poem written by a friend.....give me your comments...im me and tell me them....im not going to tell you their name..   Distasteful Love   Nude seams up the back of her naïve jambes guided her hunter down a wicked path   Of Lustful tangos, Romantic waltzes, Passionate shuffles,   Loading bullet after bullet,   And all for the sake of illicit love.   Though auburn curls engulfed her visage,  The silver twinkle in les yeux de la petite mademoiselle   Exposed the light at the end of the barrel.   A comforting grin, triggered by his amorous touch,  Shrouded her face as his hands found her taille,  Meanwhile les mains du garVon guided her girlish twirls   Around the lies and false hopes of their indecent love.    His sinfully eager eyes cascaded down her corps--   Looks that could kill.   One two three, one two three,   With each step brought a different couple’s glance.   She kissed him,   And one hundred times over,   Unashamed, and unconcerned of the inevitable expiation that lay ahead.   They waltzed alone, surrounded by an intrigued audience,   Fitting for their final serenaded stroll   Down the barren promenade of deplorable love.     Amidst the company of the smoky, ill-lighted room,  These forbidden lovers loaded the bullets with each passing dance,   Decreasing the odds of shooting a blank.   BANG! A puff of powder fogged their hearts---  A real bullet,  Killing their dishonorable love.    The black and white keys of the tinkling piano sat still   As the gentleman dipped his lady for the last time.   The smile that had once swathed her face   Left her expression,   Hand-in-hand with her soul   That had since become grayed with an everlasting yearning  For her ignominious love   Day after day,   Blank after blank,   The love had ripened to a deliciously errant obsession

      I walked in wearing a disguise that was still me but not exactly what you see everyday.  With my glasses and high shoes and non-sports clothes.  I see a familiar person and then bend around the corner looking for another familiar face trying not to be spotted.  She notices me right away glasses and all and I see her face light up a bit.  and she says " Hey hot glasses".  I say "you noticed me wow.  I said a quick hello to them both and then asked a few questions and was on my way.  I walked through just about every isle and found pretty much exactly what I was looking for.  My friend also directed me to a place where I would find exactly what I needed.  she did this on her dinner break.  Making my way up to the checkout I stand in the line of the beautiful girl that knows me so very well.  I stood very patiently behind a foreign woman who didnt quite understand what was going on or what she wanted.  My poor friend was so polite trying her best to understand this very odd and confused woman doing whatever she could to ring her up and send her home happy.  I noticed she got very nervous and kept glancing at me.  I hope I didnt distract her at all while she was on the job but then again I was just a customer standing patiently.  Maybe she was looking at me seeking a little smile or comfort while being flustered by this woman with many carriages.  Finally the woman was satisfied and her receipt finally came up.  The lady then returned not even a few seconds later with problems and had to make a return.  My very patient friend told the woman that she would fix it after she was finished with the line that during that time grew very long.  With a great big sigh of "oh my god" and a little roll of the eyes, there she was looking up at me with those big beautiful eyes that matched the shirt she wore with a great big smile looking at me.  I said hello and she loosened up a bit until she couldnt find the bar code to my first item and I told her to calm down and I showed her where it was.  She seemed nervous in a strange way yet so comfortable.  The item kept ringing up more than once and I felt like bad luck.  but she just smiled through it and told me she was on a break soon which is I bet exactly what she needed.  That and maybe a nice smile from someone she knew.  Finally my items worked and everything was all set.  I tried to help and relax her by making her count back my change. and she laughed a little and then handed me my bag and told me i could put my receipt in the bag if I would like and then I said No I have it thanks.  Then I told her " Have a great day"  And she said " You too".  Then I headed off.  Then I hear her yell to me in sort of a thanking/ nice to see you way "I'll tell her you said hi"  I told her I had already seen her and I might see her later too.  She smiled and then looked back to work.  I wish I couldve said more.  I wanted to.  Not on the first day though.  I walked out into the parking lot and then got to my car and saw that the person who had parked across from me had their car touching mine.  A little nervous and angry I backed my car up and made sure there was no damage and then I floated home in a daze of how amazingly beautiful she is.  I dont remember much of the ride home.  I dont even think I remembered to press play on my all time favorite ICP cd.    I saw her later that night and she still looked amazing.  Maybe it was the shirt.  I told her that it was a good shirt the night before.  I'm glad she listened.

      Out for my most recent run today around noon I decided to take a longer route and run by her house to see if she was there. I saw the car outside in the driveway and knew she was alone. I decided to ring the bell but I wasnt sure if she could hear me all the way up in her room so I stepped back a few steps and screamed her name at the window a few times. I heard some noises and waited at least 5 minutes knocking and screaming to her. Then the door finally opened and there she was as bold a woman ever with a fearful look in her eyes. When she saw my face I smiled and her whole body relaxed and a smile came across her face. She gave me a great big hug and I felt safe and so did she. She looked very different wearing a t-shirt and these bright yellow pj pants with bright green frogs on them. She was not wearing makeup like she always does and I could see the face of the woman I know. A worn out face that has been through a lot. We went upstairs to her room and she stopped at the bathroom to wash her face making small talk along the way. We went into her room and sat down and just looked at eachother and smiled. She asked me how I was and we talked about me and school and soccer and music and most of all me being a doctor and my love life you know, typical things. I asked her how she was and she said she wished I could stay overnight with her because she is so afraid to be in that house alone. I told her I wish I could stay too. We basically had small talk and catching up and her telling me the situation for next week and when she will be gone. We also talked about work and how I'm now her new top employee! Then my brother called and I had to drive him to work. So I had to leave and we said our long goodbyes while she was trying to keep me for as long as she could so she wouldnt have to be alone. Then another great big hug and a smile and a few I love you's and then she gave me a few nervous tips about the sun and that I'm beautiful as I was running off. She is the most amazing person I know. The strongest woman in the world. She's been through so much and still dealing. I'm her only "daughter" because her real kid hates her. I Love Her. She is truly beautiful.

      Although things havent been quite the same between us since the summer, our friendship is still one of the most important things in my life.    I love our friendship that we have.  I love how you know me so incredibly well, so much that I dont even have to say anything.    I love how we can just sit around and do nothing all day but have the best times in our lives.    I love how you steal my hatchetman all the time and I pretend to be really mad, but you know I dont care because its you and you are the only one Id let wear it but you already know that.  I love how we can spend days on end with eachother and never EVER get sick or bored of the other.  I love how even though we havent been able to talk AT ALL lately we still are the best of friends.  I love how I can trust you, because trust means so much to me.  I love how I can tell you anything with complete detail and never leave anything out and I dont have to worry about what you think or say.  I love how I can cry in front of you and you can cry in front of me.  I love how you are always there for me and you know I am always there for you.  I love how we can sit in my car and just chill and completely pour out our whole entire life stories with no shame or hesitation.  I love how if I have a problem you are always the first person I think of to go to no matter what.  I love how when you were overwhelmed with people and all you wanted to do was be alone, you wanted me to be there.  I love how there are tears in my eyes just thinking about all the times we have hung out and all the great moments and fun times we have had.    I love how Im so incredibly illegal with you and risk so many things.   I love how we have a special bond that no one will ever understand or ever EVER come close to breaking it.  Most importantly,   I Love You.

      You are the most loving woman I have ever met.  You are amazing and have an incredibly great heart.    Its taken me a while to write this blogger and this will not be the last.  There is so much i want to say but the words just wont come without the tears.  Although this is great pain for you to have to leave us,  we know that you have been blessed with this oppurtunity to change things and make a better life for yourself.  We love you so very much "mom" and we know we are the reason you are still alive and still living through your not so easy life.    You are always there for us and even though you wont be right down the street, we know you are still there.    You know you can call us and we will be there,  we are your family, your sons and daughter  we are the ones who love you and care.  We have never been able to do it without you, or you without us.  You are a big part of our lives and we are a big part of yours.    It has been the 6 of us since the very beginning.  All of us still remembering the first day we met and all the huge events of our summers.  we made it through, together, all of us.  each affected in a different way.  we are a family.  a juggalo family.    Juggalos until we die and we aint never ever ever gonna die  "we all gonna die, but im not going to fry,  even though most never try, im not going to let this pass me by"    Dont let this pass you by.  take it and go.  thats what we talked about and thats what you did and now you are gone.  not out of our lives or our hearts but out of the neighborhood.  This is a huge change for us but we can do it.  I will take care of the boys, mom, and be the best ONLY daughter that i can.  I love you too soo soo much.  I am trying to be the woman that you know I can be.    this is not even close to half of what i want to say or have to say.  i cant say it all now because the screen is so blurry and my shirt is all wet.  These tears are not all sadness.  They are a mixture of feelings and emotions and maturity.  "You are the one.  You are the one."  those were the last words you said to me before you left.  I dont know what to say to this because I know exactly what you meant by it so there are no questions to be asked.  I am the one.  I am the one.  you and the guys both have said it, and i know.  We love you "mom" more than anything.    You are the strongest and bravest woman I have ever had the honor to get to know.  Im glad I am "the one"

      i have known you for forever it seems like but it has only been a few years.  from the first day we met we knew there was something between us outside on the porch of a friend when you told me about the problems you were having with your girlfriend.  you didnt know me and i didnt know you, but we connected on a very personal level right from the beginning.  later on that week, we met late at night on the road next to my house just to talk about things in life.  you were having problems with your girlfriend and i was helping you out and we became the best of friends.  we talked and talked and talked.  i remember that night being rainy and cold but you could still see the moon and some stars and we didnt want to leave eachother.  my dad made me come inside after a few hours because he couldnt see us anymore because it was so late that cars stopped driving by.    For the rest of that summer we spent almost everyday together.  you helping me get through the worst summer of my life and making it end being one of the best, and me helping you grow and learn and giving you new life.   by the end of the summer we decided to try being a couple.  we had a blast together.  we went to the beach in maine with my family and we had that incredibly funny nights with people not acting like themselves.    I still remember that first night that we kissed.  you walked me home from our friend's house late at night with only light from the stars.  you walked me to my front steps  and then we turned and looked at eachother.  you leaned in making the first move and i kissed you back.  when we pulled away ever so slowly we were both in a daze.  you looked at me and said "wow"  i got scared and asked you why you said that and all you could say was "wow"  i was afraid i had done something wrong, but you told me i hadnt.  i was told never to let you walk home by yourself after kissing me again because someone said you floated all the way home in a daze and was completely in your own happy world the rest of the night.    we stayed together for a long time until school started and we had conflicting schedules and things just didnt seem right.  we had tried off and on throughout the year to get together but things just never seemed to workout.    we drifted apart because we hadnt talked much but when we saw eachother we could still feel that great feeling.  now we make eachother angry all the time and i pretend to hate you and you pretend to hate me.  but i realized the reason i hate you so much is because i love you so much more.   there is no denying it.  you will always have a special place in my heart.  funny how my mom and i always talk about you in the same way and we always come to the same conclusion that i am in love with you in one way or another.    right now we are the best of friends and may not agree on many things that the other does.  but i think we have a better understanding of eachother which is great.  you told me today that the concert just wasnt the same without me.  and i knew that my night away from you wasnt the same without you either.  i miss you.  i never realized that so much until today because you were away from everyone else in your life and so was i.    you may think i hate you, but i dont.  the truth is i love you.  i really do.  and i know you love me too.  i always have loved you and i always will love you.  i know this because whenever your name comes up, i never know what to say.  i get angry and confused and pretend to hate you because of what you have done or whatever.  i always have mixed feelings when i think of you.  ALWAYS.  this tells me that i have feelings and emotions that scare me and that are unknown.  i know i love you.  although i may not say it much, i do.  you have a great big heart and im glad that you use it :).  i love you.  you mean a whole lot to me and im happy to still have you in my life.

      so i walked in the room immediately went and sat down next to my best friend in the whole world.  he put his arm around me and gave me a big hug and says "wow.  we really havent hung out in forever" and i said "i know"  he said he missed it and i said that i missed him.  funny how that is because we live in the same house. so the four of us sat around for a while waiting for the other 2.  they finally arrived and then we hopped into two cars and headed out.  4 of them rode in one car while i drove my brother.  we lucked out that it was just the two of us because it hadnt been that way for so long.  i handed him the cd player with Shangrila in it and he took control of the music while i took control of the road.  sitting there with my best friend listening to our favorite music, singing, laughing, talking together.  it was great.  we talked about everything.  trying to figure out who we are and whats going on with the other.  it was a good feeling and we were both in good moods for the whole ride.  its great how much we understand eachother.    so the rest of the night went on as predicted.  i went home about an hour before he did and when he walked in i said home already? and he said that i completely predicted the whole night. and i said i know.  and then he said "goodnight meggie i love you" as he was walking down the stairs and i said good night to him and told him i loved him too.  i hope he heard me but i know he already knows that.  but just in case he didnt,  i love you stevie.  You are my best friend and im happy i have you as my brother.  meggie

      Well I'm moving kinda slow Down that same old path Wastin time inside this hour glass...  Say what you want Say what you mean Question yourself are you really what you seem?  Say who you are Say what you mean Question yourself are you really what you dream?  You might think this is easy for me But there's a lot of things you dont know You dont care You dont want to see...  Say what you want Say what you mean Question yourself are you really what you seem?  Say who you are Say what you mean Question yourself are you really what you dream?  Well I really dont want to fall back       Wow.  I never realized how much that explains what's on my mind.  I Love You.

      remember when we used to sing this song together and that is when we knew everything was perfect.   this song wasnt officially our song, but it was.    Hello my friend, we meet again It's been awhile, where should we begin? Feels like forever Within my heart a memory A perfect love that you gave to me Oh, I remember  WHEN YOU ARE WITH ME I'M FREE I'M CARELESS, I BELIEVE ABOVE ALL THE OTHERS WE'LL FLY THIS BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES MY SACRIFICE  We've seen our share of ups and downs Oh how quickly life can turn around In an instant It feels so good to reunite Within yourself and within your mind Let's find peace there  When you are with me I'm free I'm careless, I believe Above all the others we'll fly This brings tears to my eyes My Sacrifice  I just want to say hello again I just want to say hello again  When you are with me I'm free I'm careless, I believe Above all the others we'll fly This brings tears to my eyes Cause when you are with me I am free I'm careless, I believe Above all the others we'll fly This brings tears to my eyes My Sacrifice, My Sacrifice  I just want to say hello again I just want to say hello again  My Sacrifice.   Well the other day i heard that song again and all i could think of was you and funny thing is that the song that came on after was this one.  remember when, we never needed each other The best of friends like Sister and brother We understood, we'd never be, Alone  Those days are gone, and i want you so much The night is long and i need your touch Don't know what to say I never meant to feel this way Don't want to be Alone tonight  What can i do, to make you mine Falling so hard so fast this time What did i say, what did you do? How did i fall in love with you?  I hear your voice And i start to tremble Brings back the child that, i resemble  I cannot pretend, that we can still be friends Don't want to be, Alone tonight  What can i do, to make you mine Falling so hard so fast this time What did i say, what did you do? How did i fall in love with you?  Oh i want to say this right And it has to be tonight Just need you to know, oh yeah  I don't want to live this life I don't want to say goodbye With you i wanna spend The rest of my life  What can i do, to make you mine Falling so hard so fast this time What did i say, what did you do? How did i fall in love with you?  What can i do, to make you mine Falling so hard so fast this time Everything's changed, we never knew  How did i fall, In love , With you?   and again, all throughout this song that wasnt even ours, i thought of you.   i couldnt make myself stop, because i didnt want to stop thinking of you.  it made me remember how happy we were and how great we looked together and how much fun we had and how much i didnt have to think about everything i did or what other people thought.  it was great.   and i know this feeling has never gone away between us.  Basically what im trying to say is I Love You.  and i know you know that.  But i should still tell you.  Whether or not you want to feel back that is up to you.  If you know who you are when you read this, I am forever yours if you want me.  My love.

      and i sit here and wonder about how much i think about you.  it doesnt seem like much, granted it is a lot and means a lot too.    i sit here and wonder if you think about me too.  it just seems so unrealistic for you to.  i mean when im not with you we are both doing other things that occupy our minds, yet you still creep into mine and i let you, i wonder if i creep into yours...would you let me...  when you think of me is it in the same way that i think of you, because i hope it is...  i wonder if you feel any different when you think of me, because i do when i think of you...  i wonder if you feel when you think of me, because i feel feelings when i think of you...  i wonder if the thought of me makes a difference in your day, because the thought of you makes a difference in mine...  i wonder if thinking of me makes you happy,  because thinking of you makes me happy...  i wonder if you are even thinking about me right now, because obviously im thinking of you...    i wonder if you think i think about you, because i wonder if you think about me...  i wonder if thinking about me is different to you than thinking of someone else, because when i think of you its different than me thinking of someone else...  i wonder if im special to you, because you are special to me...  i wonder if you know that it is you i am thinking of, because i hope you know its you...  i wonder if you love me, because i love you...  i wonder...

      oh wow.  its amazing how one person can completely turn your life and your night around.  Now im happy i had nothing to do tonight and i stayed home.  i dont even know where to begin.  I was sitting with my parents watching a movie i had already seen but i liked a lot and wanted to see if they liked it (ya know, bonding time with the folks because they "never see me anymore")  about half-way through the movie, a call from my big brother in california came and my dad answered it and left the room.   my mom and i finished the movie and my dad was still on the phone.    my dad asked my brother if he "wanted to talk to his little sister" and at first i wasnt really up for it.  I mean my brother and i never really got along so well when he was here.  granted he is 12 years older than me and i havent seen him in over 6 years.  we just never really clicked because i was young and girls are annoying when they are young.    so i picked up the phone with a bummed out look on my face figuring the conversation would last about 5 minutes with the typical questions and uncomfortableness.    The second we started talking, you could feel this amazing connection.  He asked how i was and what was going on and we talked and talked and talked.  i learned so much about his life just by what we were talking about.  the way he talked so comfortably with me it was awesome.  I love the way he talks.  hes so cool.  he reminds me of crush from finding nemo.  exactly like him.  he uses words like "DUDE" and "SWEET" and "STOKED"  he never used words like wicked or anything like that.  i know this may not seem very different from the normal way of speaking, but it is.  he sounds like crush and is wicked hippy-coolish.  he gave me advice on things and it was great.  he told me how his whole life changed when he became a father and he said it really is the greatest thing in the world.  we realized how much we have in common and we talked for about an hour.  it was the greatest thing ever.  we LAUGHED together.  I cant really tell you everything because its more a feeling and maybe you wont understand.  but i can tell you this, for the first time in my life i can say that i love my brother so much and mean it.  not that i never meant it before but i have never said it.  It was the greatest feeling in the world to have him call me "meg" and to say things like "ask if they know your brother"  and most importantly to say "i love you" and "i love you guys" and "i cant wait to see you guys out here soon"  i cant wait to go out there.  he has so many plans for us.       The biggest personal feeling i have towards all of this, is that we could feel our connection, and out of my 3 brothers, he is the one i know the least, yet i think we are the most alike.  and im glad we are alike.    I love him.  my big brother.  my hero.

      So i walked in their with my head held high and my best friend at my side hoping that everything would be all over.  i went and stood in line while my friend sat down and picked up a magazine.  i realize that the young woman in front of me was going to take a while so i sat down for common courtesy so i wasnt listening to the girl's personal information.  so i sat with my best friend and i started reading my book.    A man in a sports jacket and shorts walked in and took my place in line.  i was a little annoyed at first but then figured it didnt really matter much.   he sat down too eventually because the poor girl was still talking to the lady behind the glass.  I stood up and went to stand in line.  when the girl was done, the man cut in front of me and went to the glass.  i turned back to my friend because there was nothing i could do about it because he didnt know.  this lady sitting in a chair looked at me and smiled and we both knew the man cut me.  but that was alright.     I finally checked in and then sat down to read for an endless amount of time.  it was finally my turn and then i had to wait again for a really long time.  After all this waiting i finally got what i went there for, only to be surprised with news that was completely out of this world compared to what i went in there thinking.   I finally got to leave.  my best friend and i were the last people to leave that office that night.  it was weird walking through an empty parking lot that is usually completely full and you have to make your own spaces.  the rest of what happened was kind of a blur to me.  the car ride home, dinner at her house, etc. etc.  i mean i knew what happened but i wasnt really there.  weird feeling to feel.     im not quite sure how i feel yet about any of this.  and i dont know if that is a problem or not.

      and i love how we understand eachother so much.  How we can sit there and decipher our lives through our music.  The silence of our thoughts is golden.  We dont even have to say anything because we know the other is thinking the same thing.  we get that feeling when the music flows through us and we cant breathe or even think because the whole world is starting to make sense.   I love how we figure these things out together even though we are both in our own worlds, I wouldnt be able to do this without her sitting there right next to me.  and the thing i love most about all this, is that i can only do this with her.

      i had a dream last night that changed my outlook on a lot of things.  the dream is still stuck in my head and no matter what i do i cant get it out.  it had so many aspects of my life that were so true it was almost real.  i learned a lot from it.  it is right, baby, everything will be ok. i love you.  some of the stupid decisions that i make could cause something bad to happen.  although you may not know it, i still love you a whole bunch and it disappoints me to see you this way.  my best friend.  sometimes i will just never understand you which is fine with me.  i never know how to take things that you say or do sometimes and this causes false assumptions about me.  my great friend.  everything has always been perfect with us and it always will be.  it will never ever work between us because i dont want it to.  i am sick and tired of your crap that even in my dreams i cant find a reason to be with you.  i do not love you.  not like that.  nor will i ever.  everything i have said in the past was just a fantasy and now it has been crushed.   these are just some of the things i have learned.  it was an intense dream.  i would like to end this with......    Be careful in life and dont take things for granted.  people are not always what they seem.  what you want may not always be the best thing.  be careful who you trust and when making decisions, dont pick the one that you want and could get away with, pick the right one.  its not that hard when it comes to that.

      we had one of the strangest conversations at lunch today.....what songs we wanted to play at our funerals.  at first we were all joking around and picking random songs and our favorite lyrics.  then conversation quickly ended.  Later on at my second home, while with my best friend, i remembered the dicussion i had for a brief time at lunch and then told her about it.  she said the thought made her feel funny and i agreed and then i told her what songs i would like to be played at my funeral and what song lyrics i would like to be read.  it wasnt one of our happiest conversations ever, but it was very good and meaningful.  Not that im planning on dying anytime soon.  but to think on the songs that mean a lot to me and my life was interesting.  we both realized that we were connected in some way by each song and this made us realize how great of friends we really were.  and thats the amazing part.    What a weird topic of conversation.

      and here i am on one of the strangest days of my life.  puking in school.    seeing every single time on the clock that is significant to me.  not feeling what i feel from the people who mean the most.  regaining a friendship that was never lost but not the best.  doing things i wouldnt normally do.  the worst headache in the world.  the weirdest coincidences.  Listening to my favorite cd of all time.  Talking about my juggalo family and what juggalettes are like.  and the best poem i have heard ever, thanks to karen.    This poem makes so much sense.  Makes sense to a part of my day.      the tattoo artist   Wild desire swells deep within. Light spills out his one squeamish delight, to be exact,  movement set to some symbol of one's might, something organic, like the center of love.  Naked to life's ecstasies, he reveals the truth: we are not all brothers under the skin.

      it is the greatest feeling in the whole world.    This past weekend i got stuck in the snow without a car at the house of my 3 best friends.  and it was definitely one of the best times in my life.  i cant quite tell you what we did because we really didnt do much of anything.  we slept in late both mornings, we watched movies, ate, hung out, you know the usual.    the feeling was the greatest though.  we were all together with the tree lit up and a fire in the fire place and the snow outside falling.  each of us doing our own thing.  it felt so great to just go off into another room and do my own thing without it being a problem.  i didnt feel out of place, no one kicked me out, everything was the same and i was there for 3 days.  it was the most amazing feeling ever.  you could feel the love and happiness and and and....it felt as if...   I was home.     Yes.  I was home.

      it was just like any other friday leaving school exhausted and happy that it was over....we drove home and didnt talk much at all....there was no music like there usually is because my cd player was broken.....i dont think we wouldve listened to the music anyway....we talked very little....listening to our own thoughts running through our heads....we got to her house and sat in the car and commented about how different the car ride was, yet still so comfortable.... we just sat there with the car off staring into her empty house....we joked around a little bit...but we just werent in the mood....then we both thought at the same time....BREADSTICKS....and she turned my car back on....i knew i didnt have a lot of time because i had to be somewhere in about an hour....but i said fuck it and we went to my house......  both of us feeling kinda shitty, we walked into the house and headed straight for the breadsticks and the music....i started cooking and she started the music.....we called our other friend and invited her over to share in the good feelings....the three of us talked cooked and ate and we all became happier and had great big smiles on our face....it made us happy to be together and to know that no matter what we had eachother and we would never have to worry about that despite all the other worries of a teenage life....and we realized there was always some good in our bad days....and that was eachother...     friends are the cure to bad days.....       i love you guys

      and all i want to do is sit here in silence...  i dont want to think or do anything at all, just sit here...  i forced myself to write this down and it doesnt even feel real at all...  i really dont know what to write with all these thoughts running through my head, all these things bothering me... i just dont want to focus on just one or think about any of them for that matter...  i dont feel like myself at all...  i spent the night reading....  and i pause to think of what to write next which is exactly what i dont want to do...maybe sleep is the best thing...  i wish i didnt have to sleep alone...  i just want to curl up in someones arms and fall asleep for a really long time... i like to think that i know of a few people that i could do this with, but some of them i second guess and that hurts... i think its time for me to stop writing...   i had no emotions today...i just cant be certain of anything i feel, or if i actually feel anything at the moment...my emotions are numb...

      and all it takes is one long drive around a small town to make the connection strengthen even more and for things to feel better again :) and that is the greatest feeling in the world to know that i have a great friend with a great heart who understands and who i trust and who trusts me.  its the feelings and the connection that make it real and it is the greatest thing ever.   i love you, my best friend :)

      and as once again the pain shoots through my body and the tears come to my eyes, the room just fades away and the sickness comes and my whole body becomes weak....my body starts to shake and the breathing quickens.....i begin to hyperventalate......  all this happens so fast and for no particular reason most of the time....then for the next few days i am miserable with the shooting pains that go through my arm and back....not many people see this because i pretend that nothing is wrong so i do not ruin their moods with my miserableness, but my great friends can see it in my eyes and know that i am in pain.......  you continue to tell me to see a doctor and you continue to tell me im stupid....it may seem like im mad at you when you say this but im not....im sorry if i make you feel that way.....the truth of the matter is that i already know what the doctors will say and that is the thing that upsets me..not you.....they will just tell me that "There is nothing we can do. Just ice and heat and keep stretching and doing your physical therapy." "Well, Doc, how long will i have to be doing all these things until i feel better?" "Well.....you are going to have shoulder and back problems for the rest of your life because of the way things healed in the past..." "well will it ever get better?" "well....it may feel better at times but there is no way it can 'get better'. it may however go in the opposite direction as you get older and cause more pain at times but you will most likely still have times where it wont hurt so bad....we're sorry, there is nothing we can do".... and then we will continue with my history...and my mom will get very upset and angry with the doctors for misdiagnosing me in the first place many years ago.....its their fault that im going to have this problem for the rest of my life and there is nothing i can do......  so that is how im feeling now and how i feel everyday of my life granted somedays are way worse than others.....you may just never notice because i never show it.....it makes me sad to say that i get used to the pain....."used to"....  but still at the end of the day, the words that keep going through my head that cause the most pain are......  there is NOTHING we can do.....you will have this pain for the REST OF YOUR LIFE.....        the rest of my life.

      and as more and more conflicting groups showed up, the more and more i felt in the middle.  with all the uncomfortableness i was feeling i decided to walk outside and do something that i hadnt done since this past summer.  i lay on the trampoline and looked at the sky.  man was it beautiful.  it reminded me of the great summer that had just past and all the great friendships that were made and how great of a feeling it was...the only difference was that i was alone and i was worried about the cold and not the bugs and i had my shirt on...great memories.        yes...Great.      im glad that these groups showed up to share the new year with everyone.  im glad for being able to experience that great feeling again and to remember the good times.     the great times.

      sometimes telling someone in your family that you love them will make their day and yours too.  you never really think to say it to your family, your parents, siblings, grandparents, etc. you just figure they already know and think it would be too weird to tell them you love them.  you also rarely think about it because you feel in a different world when you are with them than when you are with your friends in which everyone loves eachother and those words just dont have to be said.  well today i told two people so far in my family that i love them before they could even think about telling me that,  and i could just hear the happiness in their voices.  i know that they will be smiling all day because of this and i know i will be too.  it may seem like just words to people you see everyday and your peers, but to someone who really cares so much about you, it means so much more than that.  its hard for family members, especially adults, to feel important or special in the life of a teenager and this makes it so much easier.    a few weeks ago even, i told one of my brothers that i loved him.  a grown man.  when i told him this, he started crying.  i didnt just make his day, i made his entire lifetime.  to see someone you love this happy is better than anything in the world.      i knew all this before and it has happened before.  but not in a while i guess.  everyone gets wrapped in their own lives and everyday things that they dont think about the people who are thinking about them all the time.     make someone you love smile :)

      ive been waiting a long time to write this blogger, waiting for the right time.  i've decided there is no right time, because i think about it everyday.  Sometimes it may seem as though i take this friendship for granted and that is the last thing i mean.   I love you so much and when i say you are the one, you know what i mean by that.  You are a true friend.  You are my closest friend.  You are my best friend soul mate.  You are the one...  *i can talk to about anything  *that i am the most comfortable around  *that i can be myself with and not have to think twice about if you will approve or not  *that i can laugh about anything with  *that i can cry with and not hold anything back  *that i can tolerate and that can tolerate me for days, weeks, months, etc.  *i trust  *who i look up to for advice  *that when i look at you i'm home  *who tells me that everything will be ok and you are always right  *who i will always spend money on and will never make you pay me back and you know how cheap i am  *who i know will always be here  *who i know is in my future  *who i can fight with about pointless things and then end it by laughing at the funny faces we made when we were mad  *that knows me better than anyone  *with that special connection of being able to say exactly what im thinking when i cant find the words  *that makes me smile and be happy    many people fit some of these descriptions but not all.  you are the only one.  you are that special one.  you may not know it but you mean the world to me.  you are my best friend and ive never been able to truly say that confidently about anyone but you.  i love you.      ~p.s. count the stars :)~

      im not going to tell you how i feel because you will just get angry and say im stupid and that i shouldnt feel this way.  well maybe i shouldnt, but i do.  why shouldnt i feel this way?  i dont see the reason why i shouldnt.    anyway, you probably wont even know that this blogger is about you.  you will probably think its some other person in my life that im taking the situation way out of hand.  i dont understand how i could be doing that when im not even trying anymore to do anything about it.  im not giving up.  im still here.  i still care.  i just cant help the way i feel and you make me feel this way.  i just want to let you know that its not in my head because its there and its noticeable.   im sure others will know who this blogger is about but you will not.    i care...a lot.  still.  i just dont understand how you dont/cant/wont.  and i dont understand how you can pretend after all this.    this is how i felt today and that is why i wrote this blogger.

      today i read something written by a friend that told me and many others that she appreciates our friendships and that we make her happy.  She didnt have to say this at all because we already knew this, because we can see it and feel it when we are with her, but it is nice to hear and know sometimes.    Even though this doesnt have to be said, you know we love you too and personally, you are the one who gets me through the day.  i love you.        *sometimes its nice to know that you are appreciated.  it doesnt have to be said, just felt.  dont take friendships for granted.*

      wow...driving home at night in complete silence can really make you think about a lot of things.  ok so i havent thought about this in a really long time and things have been great.  ok so im going to admit it...it still bothers me.  It didnt for a really long time.  but im hurt.  very hurt.  still hurt.  i guess there really isnt much else to say because you dont care anyway, thats why it still hurts you know.    i kind of like the thinking thing.         *i am happy with the now...but im still hurt*

      i dont think most people will be a big fan of this blogger but its true.  im ready to go.  at least i think i am.  sure i love it here more than anything. 17+ years of my life.  this is home.  but visiting those places today just made me think.  I know they are just 2 places but they have nothing to do with my thoughts.  i used to think i would never be able to leave and now i dont want to wait a whole other year until i go.  im ready. i want to move on.  i know what i want and i know i will be able to find it.  im sorry if this upsets anyone.  im not going anywhere yet.  this is a good thing.  i am emotionally ready to go whenever the time comes and this is a good thing.  Great thing.      now the hard part is reaching those places :/

      please try.  you cant keep telling me that you are when there is evidence that you are not.  i know you may think this has nothing to do with me, but it does.  you just dont see it.  while you arent there, all they do is fight about it and guess who is in the middle ALWAYS..me!  you know it too.  with everything.  You have told me before that you know you are the lucky one and that you look up to me because i take all the wrath for everything.  you know every single time you do something wrong or something they think is wrong that i hear about it.  that i have to stick up for you and hold your ground even though you arent there.  half the time they tell me before you do.  what am i supposed to do.  im always on your side and you know it.  you have to talk to me more because when we do its so much easier for the both of us.  you know they yell at me first before they even get to you.  i get yelled at about you and about their fights and about practically everything.  you see it and you try to get me out even though you know it wont do any good and i thank you for that.  but this time you can help out for real by doing something about it.  it wont be that hard.  ill help you.  just ask.  i always have time for you because i love you.  you are my priority above everything else in my life and deep down you know it.  i love you.  be careful and please try.

      i doubt you will know if this blogger is about you.  if you think it is please ask.  i know we have never been the best of friends but hell we've known eachother for ever.  As the years grew on we became closer and closer because believe it or not we have a lot in common.  and one thing we have in common is that we dont show our feelings and that is why we dont seem similar.  the more and more im around you and talking to you, the more and more i realize how much i do care about you and how much i love you.  we never hang out outside of school, but the thing is i know you are always there.  and i know i could always go crying to you although neither one of us ever has before to a great extent.  i cant help feeling that even though i never talk to you or see you besides school, i am so incredibly comfortable with you.  i trust you.  i dont trust many people at all and it take me a long time to develop trust and you know why.  but even though we have never talked about it, i trust you.  i know in the past we practically hated eachother, but we really didnt.   we both know it and we laugh about it today.  we have a connection, my friend, and you and i both know it and the people who love us can see it.  they know we understand eachother, they know that we will always back eachother up and when i am reminded by these people of this great connection it makes me smile.  i was devasted, although i did not show it, at the thought of losing you.  im so glad that that is not going to happen and i hope it never does.  im here for you and you know it and i know you are there for me.  the words dont have to be said.  we can just feel it.  and its great.  ive never told you before about any of this so i figured it was time to let my feelings out. ive been saving this blogger forever and adding more and more to it but i realize that i will never be able to finish it.  there is always more to add and it will never be complete or perfect.  and you know how much that frustrates me because we are perfectionists.    *you really mean a lot to me.  you are a true friend.  i love you*

      sometimes people who are not involved force you to make a decision against your desires.  sometimes people just dont understand and never will.  sometimes you just have to let someone go even if its what you both dont want.        *it feels so right being with you.  i wish i didnt have to let you go.*

      i knew words and songs were very powerful and that they can be very moving...  but there is nothing like this song that i heard yesterday.  this song fits into my life so well and exactly everything ive been going through and its given me answers that no one may understand.  i could never understand why until i heard this song and now im starting to cope and understand and get better.  its amazing what words can do through song.    the song is in the form that someone would be singing the words to me and it is amazing.  i think if anyone ever sang this to me i would break down and hug them forever.       *its amazing what words can do*

      it was an amazing day today at the Butts Homestead.  (funny name but it is true)  so i wasnt really looking forward to the family reunion today in Stanfordville, New York at the Butts Homestead.  I wasnt looking forward to seeing all these people that i call "family" but i havent seen them in over 14 years so i obviously dont know or remember them.  My brother and i were going there with the knowledge that none of our first cousins or first aunts or uncles would be there so we would know no one.    we drove past the front of the house and took a right onto the street that the driveway was on and then pulled in and parked.  It was such a beautiful day.  we met a few people in the "parking lot" and then headed out towards the house and the party.  with mixed feelings my brother and i started towards the people...we had to walk through a little gate to get around some trees and then we were shocked and amazed.  it turned out that two of my aunts were there and one of my cousins and her fiance which made things more comfortable and after the overwhelming hugs and handshakes i began to look around.  i was amazed at all the beautiful 500 acres of land that my grandfather's uncle alfred owned in his prime when he invented scrabble.  he called it "the Butts Homestead" and this is where we all grew up.  although i hadnt been there since i was 3 i looked around and remembered certain little things and i remembered things from the black and white pictures from when my dad was a baby.  it was amazing.    i was so excited and amazed to learn and see all the things and places that have been in all the family stories so i explored with my dad's cousin, Bob, who owns the place now.  let me start from the beginning:  The house was huge.  well huge for its time.  A mansion back in the day when it was built and still incredibly large compared to a bunch of modern houses.  when i walked in the house, the first thing i saw was a frame on the wall with a very old christmas card in it.  it had 4 drawn pictures of the house in the winter and it said "Greetings from the Butts Homestead....Alfred and Nina"  Alfred was my dad's great uncle.  Next stop was "the cottage".  the cottage was right behind the house and was very small and was decorated like a dollhouse on the outside and inside it was used as a shed where we kept all the traditional family outdoor games.  Next stop was the barn.  i learned that we used to keep horses in the barn and we even had a little ring too.  it was pretty amazing.  Bob lives alone and he said that it was just too hard to keep the horses, but someday they would be back again :).    the next stop was the family tennis courts and the basketball court.  wow these places need a lot of work, but nothing a couple of kids couldnt do.  i remember many stories from the infamous tennis courts and my brothers...hehe  Behind the tennis courts was the Lake.   way back when, Alfred had a dam built on the river making the lake.  the lake needs a lot of work too but so does everything else.  Bob told me that the family also owned the other side of the lake and then some.  it was pretty amazing see all that land.  then my daddy showed me the dock and told me that he remembered when he built it and put it there with his brothers and cousins when he was young.  and believe it or not, the dock is still in perfect shape :) hehe Bob also showed me the boats too.  after the dock, we went to the other house.  this house was smaller than the first and was being rented out to a family for a vacation.  this house used to be where Alfred's housekeeper lived.  wow. right on the lake.    our last and final stop before returning back to the party was the best stop of all.  If you know me, you know that i am not a bug person at all.  but get this, Bob is a beekeeper.  my cousin maria and i put on long clothes and veils and went with Bob to go see the bees.  it was AMAZING being that close to them.  he took out the hunny and showed us the hives and there were so many bees it was ridiculous.  i was right there in the middle of it all watching a miracle happen.  it was incredible.  we even got to take hunny home that Bob had already taken from the hives.  but the best part was that i made it out of there without a sting :)  it was so much fun  so all in all the day didnt turn out so bad and i got to see the place that everyone has memories from and where we all grew up,  including myself.  i learned the exact spot where i got my first bee sting when i was a baby.  and now i can say that i had a different first experience with bees at this place.  this place is exactly the kind of place where i have always wanted to live.  it was like a dream come true, because i knew such a place had existed and that i had once been there.  maybe someday i will live there, or a place like it.  Bob was thinking about selling it someday and i want to keep it in the family.       :)wow.

      you dont know who i am and i dont know you either.  i dont know your name or even what grade you are in, but you made my day.  as i was standing proud hearing the national anthem for my country and quietly singing along with the Voice class, because i always sing the Star Spangled Banner at every event especailly on the soccer field, i looked over to look at my best friend but she didnt notice and a few seats in front of her was you and you looked at me as i mouthed the words and you smiled and i smiled back.  it was great.   smiles like these can really brighten someone's day even if you've never met the person.      smile

      something has happened with us and i always try to hide it.  there are times when i just cant trust you anymore and i hate it.  i dont know how to feel.  you mean everything but i dont know this other person that i see sometimes and i dont like that person.  i dont trust that person.  i know its not you and if you saw yourself, you would agree.  dont get me wrong things are great, but i cant help but worry about this little feeling.

      we talked today.    this is something we havent done in a really long time and it felt good.  and i know you felt good too.  there is still something there and i know it.  you opened up to me.  you felt scared and alone and you seemed as if you wanted to give up.  you told me these things and i told you that everything would be alright and i helped you through this coversation and your thoughts.  at one point you almost cried but then we made eye contact and you saw that i understood.  i believe in you and i know that everything will work out in the end.    i went to you later on and told you that you could always call me because i am always here for you and you said you almost did last night.  you have no idea how much that means to me.  you made me feel special again.  out of all this the thing that felt the greatest was when we made eye contact and smiled.  you have no idea how much you mean to me.  i love you so much.  even though today was probably not a big deal for you and it may not be a big deal at all, it made my day.        *i love you and everything will be alright*

      Plans got screwed up as usual as it always does with us and you know that.  We went from going in 1 car to 3.  the purpose of this event was to celebrate our being together but it always seems to celebrate how much apart we are.  Anyway a group of us left around 230 and another decided to not go with us at all and went with someone else.  Then the remaining 3 of us left later than wanted but still looking forward to the night.  We were on our way to a place we had been together previously and got really lost on the way.  It didn’t bother us because we were the laid-back group who just wanted to be together and to have fun.    So we arrived later than we expected but oh well.  We decided to walk for food and then get into the line that we would be standing in for another hour or so.  The rest of our party was farther up the line but we didn’t care all that much.  There was chanting and much fun while waiting in the line and to our surprise a light rain began to fall and made us anticipate the event even more. The Black Rain Tour.  We looked in front of us to see this giant big-bird looking character with a girls arms around its neck.  It took us a while to figure out the sex of this big-bird character but that was the fun in it. We looked to our right to see the sorry sight of a 12 year old boy that was drunk because of this guy who treated him like crap.  We looked to our left and saw a bunch of people inhaling the exhaust of a Bronco.  All these things didn’t matter to us because it was just proof that no matter who you were you still belonged when you were with this large group of people.   The line finally began to move a little after 7 and the chanting started up again stronger than before.  People everywhere with smiles on their faces and an excited look in their eyes.  It was finally our turn and we got out our tickets and prepared for the security check.     We were in!  we made it.  We were there despite all the people who didn’t want us to go, we made it.  There was a mad rush to the merchandise counter so we handed over all our money to one person and he bought everything we wanted while the two of us went to look for the rest of the group.  The two of us, dressed the same and with the same expression on our face marched side by side through the crowds of people looking for familiar faces.  We finally found them. Not where we had expected them but we found them.  We found out that the group was completely split up.  One in the front, on upstairs, a few in the middle and then the two of us getting ready for the pit while we waited for our shirts.  We went back to the merchandise counter so that we could receive our shirts and show our friend where everyone else was.  While waiting for him we watched the very attractive guy behind the counter.  We made jokes with each other without removing our eyes from the gorgeous body of this mysterious guy.  We finally got our shirts and we were so excited that we put them on right away and forgot to look at them until 10 minutes later.  We felt proud and perfect and incredibly happy as if nothing could ruin our night now.    Eventually everyone was in the building and the show was ready to start.  We decided to stay out of the pit for a while and wait for the main event.  The first act was so bad we don’t even remember his name but that’s ok because no one was paying attention anyway.  We were too excited.    Next came this really hott singer who was pretty good.  One song really hit everyone though.  He told us to put up peace signs and remember all our homies that were gone and he mentioned his homies such as Tu Pac, Notorious BIG, and many others.  Everyone in the audience got fairly quiet because we were all touched by his comment and then he sang a song that none of us expected.  It was a song about his homies.  It was a song that all of us knew and we were all touched by it.  This was his last song and then he introduced the main event.    Now you have to understand that this group is a mix of 4 different groups that came together in the beginning and made a cd. And now this is their second one and they decided to tour so this is really big.    We then ran down to the pit to get ready for the big event.  We got so excited we couldn’t even stop from screaming and chanting and going crazy.  The intro to the second CD started playing and everyone started screaming and we started plowing our way through the pit.  The two of us then looked at each other and realized that we would rather watch this particular concert from a place where we could see very well.  So we started making our way out of the pit right as our stars of the night took the stage.  We got so excited and started screaming while they started singing a song that we were pretty familiar with.  Once we finally got out of the pit and headed back to our “spot” They started singing the song in which I first played for you when I first introduced them to you.  We turned and looked at each other and started screaming our heads off. Immediately we thought of our 3rd companion who could not make the show and then we decided to sing louder as if she were there. They played a bunch of our favorite songs from both Cds and we were screaming and jumping and admiring the people up on stage.  They sang the song your dad doesn’t like and we started flipping out because it was so great how they performed it and with the lights and everything made it like a dream.  Then a song that you weren’t too familiar with started and I started laughing.  You didn’t understand until I started singing the chorus using the words I used to think were the lyrics.  We started laughing because we had talked about that song on the way up.  Then there was a very short break and all the performers went back stage.  Then out of the crosses came out 4 of the performers and they started singing one of my favorite songs ever.  This particular song was not on either one of the CDs but on one of the other performer’s CDs.  I started flipping out and screaming every word at the top of my lungs with my hands flying in the air while you just looked at me and smiled.    Then we could feel the concert coming to an end and all the performers of the night were brought onto the stage and they sang the one song that unites all of the people in the room.  I turned around and saw 2 of my original boys and gave them huge hugs before the lyrics started.  Then I looked at you and gave you the biggest hug ever.  Throughout the whole song everyone was screaming the lyrics with their hands in the air. Every once in a while I would look back at you and you would look at me and smile.  We were having the time of our lives.  The song seemed to never end because it is still playing in my head when in reality the song only lasted 10 minutes.    During this song was when I realized that I didn’t want to be at that concert with anyone else but you.  You are my family.  It wouldn’t have been the same without you and it wouldn’t have meant as much to me.   Thanks for being my sister and my best friend.       *It wouldnt have been so special without you*

      Somewhere out on that horizon  Out beyond the neon lights    I know there must be something better  But there's nowhere else in sight    It's survival in the city  When you live from day to day  City streets don't have much pity   When you're down, that's where you'll stay    I know there must be something better    I was born here in the city  With my back against the wall   Nothing grows, and life ain't very pretty  No one's there to catch you when you fall  Somewhere out on that horizon  Far away from the neon sky  I know there must be something better  And I can't stay another night        * I know there must be something better but theres nowhere else in sight *

      i think its amazing how one week you can be completely a mess and really down...and then all of a sudden someone comes along and you forget all your troubles and you are all happy again.  then a friendship evolves that seems like it has already been forever.  you begin to forget the times before you were friends with this person.  the best part of all is that they still make you happy with every smile and phone call and hug :) its something that you never expected from the beginning but is one of the most comfortable and greatest feelings ever.            *you are the greatest and i love you*

      walking down that hallway towards those double automatic doors with a huge letters above it written in red saying "Critical Care"  Its the type of place that you see in movies all the time and hope that you never have to see for yourself.  but i went through those double doors with my mom and brother beside me. we could do it.  when we found his room in a corner suite, he was lying on his side..well sort of...facing us.  he was asleep and looked like a little boy with his thumb in his mouth.  we decided to wake him if we could.  he woke up and we talked for a while and helped him order a dinner that he could eat while lying completely on his back.  it was so weird looking at him and seeing all these tubes and wires and machines.  he seemed to be doing fine but he looked very tired.  at one point amongst all the wires and strange beeping sounds, he looked at me with his little brown eyes and his eyes drooping and i smiled and then he smiled back, and that was the first i had seen him smile since he had been in there.  i know hes going to be fine, hes just very stubborn about it.  who wouldnt be? having to lay on their backs and not being able to move for 3 days without anything to do.  i know he will be fine and hopefully home today but only if hes ready.  its just weird not having him here everynight and knowing where he is.."Critical Care".  its scary.        *everything's going to be ok daddy.  you can make it through this :)*

      i dont really want to say this but i had a dream last night telling me to say it.  im only trying to be a good friend in this and you will appreciate in at some point in your life.  i know i wouldnt have a chance to tell you in person because i never see you so here goes...   this recent decision that you just made is affecting your life more than you think.  you are changing into a completely different person and you may not know it.  change isnt bad but knowing you, you wont like the way that you are changing if you could only see yourself.  i hate to say this but you are turning into her.  and as far as i know that is everything you dont want.  im not telling you to do anything because im not like that.  im just telling you as a friend and someone who used to know you very well, that this just doesnt seem like you at all.  it seems like you are throwing away your morals, and your opinions, and your beliefs.  you seem to be contradicting them.     i hope everything turns out ok in the end.  until then i hope you are still yourself.       *i hate to say it but you are turning into her*

      i was told today that someone who is not very close to me had a strange dream the other night.  they were...me.  she was meg in her dream.  she had my hatchetman and my watka bag.  she doesnt remember what happened but she knows that she was me.  i think its kinda strange because we never talk and its weird that someone that you are not close to would become a very important part of your dream.  dreams are strange.  ive been having a lot of dreams lately.  they are very strange and have different people in them doing different things.  so ive been thinking about dreams lately.  ive also been waking up a lot in the night.  i wonder if the dreams scare me.  strange.       but i keep on dreaming

      Today in Boston there was this boy without a shirt on.  We had never met before and still have never exchanged words.  The first time i saw him was just a usual coincidence.  we were in the same place at the same time walking in the same direction.  He noticed me looking at him while i was noticing him looking at me.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  you see strangers all the time.  and then you never think of them again right?  Later on that day, I was walking along the river with my friends having a great time and apparently he and his friends decided to do the same.  I passed this very attractive boy and we exchanged glances as it happened, but still remained in the conversations with our own group of friends.  Then i began to think... weird...seeing the same person like that in a crowd of thousands?!  but we were in the same place so i figured it was ok...  Later on in the day I decided it was time for me to eat so i went to stand in line only to find the boy with the blue eyes just a few people to my left looking back at me.  I wonder if he was thinking the same things i was...3 times in one day.  In such a crowd? being able to spot the same pair of eyes?!  I decided to go on with my day and forget about it.  My friends and I decided to leave early so we caught the T to go to Fanuil Hall and believe it or not that beautiful tan boy now wearing a blue shirt was also on the T with his friends....in the same car...same train...going to the same place.   Weird how these things happen.  I dont really know why it did or if there is a reason why...or just coincidence.   (kinda reminds me of Magnolia)      I'm just happy that i saw this gorgeous boy today and that he made me smile.  because I saw him smile to me first :)     abuhhhh

      when we were young, we used to stay up really late and watch movies that we shouldnt have been watching.&nbsp; we used to stay up all night talking about the movies and all the new experiences that would come in our future and guessing at how these things really were in real life.&nbsp; we were so wrong, but its fun to think about it.&nbsp; this was back when boys were yucky (even though they still are) and "dating" was just a word that you heard on tv.&nbsp; we were the best of friends and did everything together. things were great.  now many years have passed and we are still the best of friends.&nbsp; we cant catch up on day to day things like we used to because so much happens now that we are in highschool.&nbsp; now we lie around all day and all we want to do is sleep and watch movies that we should have been watching when we were younger.&nbsp; we still guess about the future and finding out new experiences that we will face some day but now the guesses are more realistic.&nbsp; we barely ever see eachother because we are so busy and we dont have the common 2 practices and a game a week to count on.&nbsp; but now we switched things around and we are on opposing teams.&nbsp;but when we see eachother everything is great and we can talk about the past the present the future and so on.&nbsp;   she is my friend that i have known the longest that has been my best ever since the beginning.&nbsp; just because we dont know everything that happens in eachothers lives at that exact moment, we still know the most about eachother.&nbsp; we even found out that we come up in eachothers conversations with other people.&nbsp; that means that we think about eachother subconciously because we matter in eachothers lives.&nbsp;   we made a deal to see eachother more often because we realized that it only takes me 5 more minutes to get to her house than it does for me to get to ashby.&nbsp; weird?!&nbsp;   i love her and i know she will always be my best friend.&nbsp; no matter where we end up in life.&nbsp; whether we agree or disagree and whether we are into the same things or not.&nbsp; things are never going to change because of that.  i love you whit.&nbsp; you are the greatest.&nbsp; i missed you and i cant wait to see you again.  hopefully the next time isnt on the field....  &nbsp;   because NM is going to win this time:)

       There is this little girl that looks up to me a lot.&nbsp; Little?! who am i kidding shes a giant compared to me.&nbsp; she is just 3 years younger.&nbsp; she is such a great kid.&nbsp; she listens and she cares.&nbsp; her sister calls her obsessed sometimes because she writes about me in her profile.&nbsp; she even leaves me away messages so that i can read them.&nbsp; she even comes back online on my lunch break every day just to say hi and to see how my day is going.&nbsp; she is a really great girl and she cares a lot and has a great heart.&nbsp; she makes me smile everyday.&nbsp; i just dont think she realizes how much i really appreciate her.&nbsp; i try to tell her sometimes but its hard when you are older.&nbsp; i know it sounds like im a bad person now but i think everyone has experienced a friendship with someone either years younger or years older than yourself and the older one has&nbsp;a life that is much more busy than the younger and the younger is always there waiting for the older.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  You are a great person and i love talking to you everyday.&nbsp; Thanks for making me smile :)

      last night i saw the whole season on paper.  one little spot on the paper.  it seems like its not that much time at all and it really isnt.  but when you think about it...so much will come out of that little spot on the paper.  all the memories all the friendships all the fun.  and it wont end after the last line on that piece of paper.  it will continue this year.  we are planning for it.  the 4 of us.  the 3 captains and the coach.  there is so much to look forward too and that little spot will become so huge that we will need a book for it.  yea.    that little spot will not be little forever.  this year is going to be awesome. too bad its the last. but it will be the best.     heres to the season and the team.

       Last night i had the strangest dreams ever. every single person that i have ever met or that i have seen in a crowd and remembered their face was in my dream at one point or another. There was no sequence to the story yet there was one idea.        The way I reacted to every person in my dream was as if it were really happening right now... whether or not i only knew this person when I was 5 and havent seen them since.  Everything that happened I have thought about at least once before in my life and it was as if it were all coming true.        Each detail of every story within the idea was so detailed and so real.  the people were real to every detail of their face from the last time i saw them.  i could even feel the people it was so real.  so real.      It was as if everything were happening for real right now.  and it did.  in the dream that is.  so weird.         ...you were there...
