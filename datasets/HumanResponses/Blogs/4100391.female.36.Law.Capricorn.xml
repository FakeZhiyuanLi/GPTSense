      Since my divorce about a year and a half ago, I have dated several men in their late 40s. And a couple in their early-to-mid 50s who lied about their age. This is not really by choice, but because they were the only people who asked me out. And I've concluded that there is a problematic disconnect here, between what I want and what men seem to want. I want to date people my age, for one thing - I prefer to talk to somebody with the same cultural references. Like punk rock, for example. Men over 45 in the midwest haven't heard of it. Plus there is the whole physical attraction factor - as far as I'm concerned, kissing a 55 year old guy feels like kissing my dad, which seems uncomfortably fetishistic. However, it appears that the only men attracted to me are at least 15 years older than I am.  Why is this? I've developed a couple of working theories. First, men in general are attracted to women younger than themselves, because by definition younger women are more attractive and men all think they deserve more beauty than they themselves possess. Second, men over 45 are less likely to form a rigid connection between thinness and beauty due to the kind of girlie pictures they were looking at as teenagers. I'm not fat, I don't think, but I'm kind of germanically medium sized with a round butt and big breasts and not much of a waist. Hm, maybe I am fat after all. I can't tell. So possibly I can just lose weight to accomplish my goal, but I'm not sure that is enough to offset the 15 year age difference requirement.   And my butt disappears when I get thin, which my ex-husband said was hideous (and he  is  my age and never seemed to find me at all attractive after we got married).  And I hate dieting. Well, we'll see if I can develop some empirical evidence, I've been smoking again (dammit) so I'll probably drop some weight without having to try.  Which brings me to haircuts. Men in their late 40s and beyond almost invariably have really bad haircuts. There's the 1980s cop haircut, which you can also observe on male members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Side part, not quite short enough above the ears somehow. Or they're going bald but refuse to cut hair surrounding their tonsure shorter than the cop haircut, leading to a Bozo the Clown appearance. This is a shame, because women do not object to baldness if it is allowed to happen gracefully. Which means cutting what's left short (no, do not shave your head). Keep in mind, baldness is just a sign of testosterone poisoning and suggests that you can still get it up reliably.  Even worse, there is a segment of my sample population who persist in believing that they look younger/sexier/more dashing/cool with long hair. This is untrue, and the hair simply makes them look like old (old!) hippies. Which, of course, they are - and I'm sure their locks looked fine in 1975. However, long hair is for the very young, and having it cannot turn back the clock, guys. No man over the age of 35 should wear his hair long unless he's blessed with perfect, gorgeous, genetic freak hair or has dreads (excepting Eddie Van Halen, who also can wear parachute pants with impunity). If you absolutely must, wear it in a shag that doesn't go much longer than halfway down your neck. This can look ok, and is usually matched with vegetarianism, a goatee and Tevas.  During my dating experiments, I have observed that these guys overwhelmingly lie about their age. Why? Do they really think I can't tell just by looking? Even if that weren't enough to tip me off, stories about, say, Vietnam, will do the trick.   The old saw is that women won't admit to age, but I've never lied to someone I wanted to date, at least not about that.   There doesn't seem to be much point -  one's years are an indelible fact.

      I've decided to try my hand at the essay form, and figure that a blog is the perfect self-aggrandising way to do it.  Besides the fact that at the moment I have few companions to vent to, I spend most of my life at a law office where I really can't freely express myself.  So exhibiting my thoughts to the world is an appealing concept.   My disclaimer:  all persons and tales herein are out-and-out fabrications, no truth whatsoever to any of it , and any resemblance to actual persons or situations are totally coincidental.   Particularly any musings that refer to my ex-husband, my job, and people I claim to have met.

      I've recently been mulling over the question of which is worse:  other lawyers or my clients, at least the ones who are private individuals (Business clients are not included in this equasion, and have their own drawbacks which I will discuss some other time).  Which would be the more horrible desert island companions?   On one hand we have other lawyers, arrogant lying whores who would sell their grandmother for a collectible billable hour spent drinking and/or playing golf.   Other lawyers do many contemptible and irritating things.  It goes without saying that they lie compulsively.  If they think the client will pay their fees, they refuse to settle even if it is obvious that they will do no better at trial.  They willfully misinterpret orders on appeal for the same reason.  For lack of a better argument, they routinely pull the ethics card and accuse their adversaries of professional malpractice, often in written documents filed with the court.  One way to tell how close another lawyer is to suspension is the concurrent increase of the frequency and venom of his attacks on others' ethics.  On the other hand there are clients, and let's face it, they need lawyers for a reason.  People who are capable of  taking care of their business  do not typically need lawyers.  They resolve situations as they develop and minimize or prevent damage.  They don't do incredibly stupid things like sign contracts they don't understand or expect too-good-to-be-true results.  When they do need legal work it usually is transactional - they come in once, get advice or some targeted legal services, and don't show up again until they decide to update their estate plan.    These are not the clients I'm talking about.   The clients discussed here are  typical  clients.   It goes like this:  First they call me on the phone to get free legal advice about their problem, which I refer to privately as the 'horse'.   The horse is sick; I give them options and suggest they hire a veterinarian (me).  They ask how much I will charge, are shocked at my estimated fee, and hang up.  They call several more times for free advice.   Weeks or months later, the horse is dying and  and they finally come in.  They tell me all about how others victimized them and caused the horse to be sick, and often cry.   At the meeting, I determine that the horse is now dead.  I tell them that they will be paying me to bury the horse and minimize the smell of it rotting away.   They do not hear me say that the horse is dead.  What they hear instead is their own hallucination, of me stating that I  have the power to resurrect the horse and make it 10 years younger.   For free.   We then move on to the fee.  They are dismayed that I will not help them without money up front, and attempt to negotiate a payment plan.   When I refuse to go for this, they grudgingly pay an advance.  I explain that the advance fee is an estimate, and that they will have to pay more when it is used up.   They are smilingly happy to have paid a flat fee to me for lifetime, unlimited legal representation, and object to paying for the meeting because they have unilaterally decided it was a "free initial consultation."  I explain to them that the courts are slow, and that they must be prepared for delays caused by the adverse party.   They say they understand and leave, but only in body.  In fact, they are still with me via the telephone.  They call constantly, and are angry if I do not respond the same day.   They leave messages demanding faster and more action on my part.  Clients insist on telephone communication because it is not mail, and thus not a potential bill.  They never open any mail that I send them in the firm's envelope because it might be a bill, which they only pay (partial payments) when I threaten to withdraw.  They fail to show up for pretrial conferences and hearings on motions they demanded I file, and I get chewed on by the judge as a result.   The calls stop when their discovery responses are due, or some other information requirement is imposed on them.   It is as if they have entered the witness protection program.  I resort to sneakiness, faxing them letters and sending them messages in plain white envelopes with no return address.  I warn them of dire consequences resulting from non-compliance; sanctions, contempt, dismissal.  These activities are followed by one of two scenarios.  If they don't respond, I eventually send them a notice of intent to withdraw by certified mail.  They don't pick it up, but the judge lets me off the hook.  Occasionally my pleas convince them, and we go back to (the above paragraph).  So, back to the question presented, are other lawyers worse than my clients?  I think it comes down to this:  you can't have sex with your clients -  even if you wanted to, I mean.   Other lawyers are fair game, however, and liquor can even make it seem like a good idea.  It isn't, and you will be sorry later, but on that basis the other lawyers are the more desireable desert island companions.
