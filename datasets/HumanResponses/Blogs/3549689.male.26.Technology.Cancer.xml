						   As I learnt recently, every simple question, can have a simple answer, or a quite complex one. Sometimes the simplicity of the question can hide a lot of complexity, and sometimes the answer that is required os so simple, that you don't even believe you could be correct.  I shall be posting on this some simple java questions, that I shall then proceed to answer, with both, a simple answer, and a complex answer (both of which  I  consider correct, which may or may not stand for anything.). So,     Question # 1:  In Java, when would you use  private static final ?     Simple Answer:    Whenever you want to use a class-level constant.    Why?   Making a member  private , means it's only visible to objects of the same class (unless, of course, expose via a public  getter  method.  Making it  static  means that there's only one instance of that particular member variable. This is good since there is no point having more than one instance of a constant.  Making it  final , means that it can only be assigned once, alowing the compiler to optimize the bytecode since it is known that the value of that variable is never going to change once assigned.     Complex Answer:   You need to have a better reason to use  private static final . A constant, if ever declared, is wasted if it is private. The basic reason for any constant's existence is to be reused, and to offer a one-point change. And if you want maximum reuse, you want to make that constant public. And probably move all constants to a separate class/interface, where they can be managed much more easily. You might even want to load the values of the constants from a properties or xml file, where they can be edited by someone who doesn't have or need access to the source code.   A more sensible use of  private static final , is for a handle to a component like Log4J's  Logger  class if you want a category (represented by an instance of the Logger class) per class. You assign it only once and don't need more than one instance for each class. And it doesn't make sense to expose one class's logger object to another class.  (Of course, you might want to think about having a category per method, rather than a category per class - for increased granularity and better log management.)

						   For a few months now, I've wanted to buy a new cellphone.     I currently own two Nokia GSM-based phones, both dual band, one of which works in India, and another which works in the US. So having one tri-band phone that works in both places, would make a little sense.    I'm a big Nokia fan, and no amount of features can tear me away from the brand. I compared the following phones (all Nokia) that are currently available in India:    6220 - Rs 14,200  6230 - Rs 22,000  6610 - Rs 9,200  6610i - Rs 11,200  7250i - Rs 10,800    The above-mentioned prices are in INR and were correct as of July 15, 2004 in Chennai, India.    I compared the phones using  urlLink Nokia's Phone Comparison tool .     The 6610i is similar to the 6610, with some additional features like the built-in digital camera, and more memory. Though I don't need the digital camera (I have a 5.1 MP Sony Cybershot), I'd still prefer the 6610i for it's larger memory and Silver-grey casing. In my area the 6610 is only available in Black - which looks pretty sleek, but pales in comparison to the Silver-grey.    The 7250i didn't impress me at all with respect to the other phones, and I dropped that pretty early on during my comparison. The main thing I didn't like was its look.    I'd had my eye on the 6200 for quite a while when I was in the US. The 6220 is the newer cousin of that phone with a built-in digital camera and video recorder.  It's also got support for TCP/IP, EDGE and SMTP/POP3/IMAP4, which I'll probably never use, but are features that might prove useful in the long run.    The 6230 is the new cousin of the 6220 and has Bluetooth capability, a 64k color display (the others only support 4k colors), can play MP3s, and has more memory. The best feature of the 6230 is that is supports addition of an MMC which can be upto 512MB. My laptop (an HP Pavilion zv5000 series) too has a built-in MMC drive.  The phone is also a little smaller, but doesn't have the good design of the 6220.    All phones are GPRS-enabled.    For reasons that I'm somewhat unable to fathom at this moment, I selected the 6220.    I then went on to compare it with the current hot favourite - the Sony Ericsson T610. The phone costs round Rs 11,000, and has all the features of the Nokia 6230 (except the video recorder and the MMC slot), with a bonus USB port. Which means that I can use a standard USB cable (the same one that connects my Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen NX MP3 player and my Sony Cybershot DSC-P10 Digital Camera to my laptop), to connect the phone to any PC. With Nokia I need to buy a data cable which costs Rs 1,100.    Which means I could by two T610s for the cost of a Nokia 6230, and (counting the cost of the cable) still have money to spare. The 6220 wouldn't cost as much as the 6230, but would still cost more than the T610, with a significantly lesser number of features.    You'd think that after all this research I'd be rushing to the Sony-Ericsson store to get that phone.   Instead, I'm still thinking about the Nokia 6220, because I don't like the idea of buying any phone other than a Nokia. Call me crazy.

						   Recently, I saw a blogspot blog where the author had setup Trackbacks. A little exploration got me to  urlLink Haloscan , which provides a free Comment/Trackback service for blogs that don't support them.    Using Haloscan is pretty simple. You Login, and then following their  instructions  for which you'll need to select your blogging tool (in my case, this is Blogger). They give you a set of html tags which you paste into your template at the appropriate locations. You might need to hunt around a bit to find the right place for your template, though.    One thing that I didn't do the default way, was use Haloscan's Comment service. Blog*Spot comes with a comment service which works well enough, and I didn't want to have my comments logged by an external tool when an internal one was available. So I only selected the  Trackback  part of the html that Haloscan provides (the bit after the '|'), and pasted that into my template.    And Voila! I now have trackback.   The Haloscan website also allows you to send Trackback pings to other weblogs. (This is the same as the service I mentioned in  urlLink Trackbacks when your blog tool doesn't support them )    Don't forget to customize your Haloscan account. You can choose the template used for displaying the comments/trackbacks and other stuff. The only pain right now, is that the Time Zone list doesn't include India. There's GMT + 5, and GMT + 6. No GMT + 5:30.    Until I find another cooler Trackback service, or until Blogger starts supporting Trackbacks, I'll be using this one.    Let me know if anyone needs help with adding Trackback to their blog. Editing templates can get quite messy. I'd even recommend copying your template to your local disk before you make changes.

						   If you blog at blogspot, and have found yourself wondering how to send a trackback ping to a related post, you might want to try  urlLink SimpleTracks .  Blogger doesn't support Trackbacks yet, and if it is important to you, you might want to try jroller or other more advanced blogging sites, but if you're not fussy (like me, currently) this is a neat workaround. There are others like  urlLink Wizbang's Standalone Trackback Form  but that one didn't work for me.

						    urlLink A post on Vivek's blog  got me thinking about some of the reasons why a large number of people desperately want to get GMail accounts these days.  There are sites where you can sign up for a lucky draw to get invites. Online communities are full of people requesting, begging and pleading for a GMail account invite. And there's a whole lot of noise all over the place about GMail, and tools for GMail. I even saw a site put up by this guy who wanted to test how long it takes to fill up his 1GB GMail account. It took him  urlLink a little over a month .   With overflowing webmail accounts limited to as little as 2MB, one does like the idea of having a 1GB webmail account which won't expire when you change service providers, leave school, or leave your company. Aso, now that 7MB mail of my friend's wedding photographs won't choke up my mailbox.  But, as I keep trying to explain to people, a 1 GB mailbox is the least of the reasons to go for a GMail account (Specially with the likes of Rediff and Yahoo increasing their mail account size limits). The features that Gmail provides, makes it almost as user friendly as your desktop email client. Yahoo, Rediff and Hotmail don't even come close.  Of course, a lot of the fuss about GMail stems from the fact that thought free, it is not available to everyone right now, and having an account puts you in some kind of elite group.  I got my GMail account invite from a friend without trying too hard, but a lot of people are looking for an account to be able to choose their favourite email address.  billgates@gmail.com  was among the first to go. An email address with just your first name (like rajesh@gmail.com) is among the more popular reasons to get an account early. I wonder why anyone would want to do that, though. I think people with just their first name in their email address are simply asking for mail that was intended for someone else. Inspite of having a hotmail email account that is made up of both my first and last name, I keep getting mails meant for other Rajesh Advani's. There's one in Boston, one in Dallas, one in Canada, one in Ivory Coast, one in New Jersey, and lord knows how many more. People keep congratulating me on my newborn child. Considering that I'm not married yet, that is probably not very good news... I now prefer email addresses that no one else is likely to want. Keeps my mailbox cleaner.  For those wanting to know how good GMail is, I think the answer is that it's pretty good. It's still in Beta though, and so it needs some tweaks, but overall it's better to open a GMail account than one with the standard email providers. And those of you hunting for invites, I'm sorry but I have none. :)

						   Interesting Soap Opera:  1. A guy called Ken Brown, President of something called the  urlLink AdTI , is writing a book questioning the fact that Linus wrote Linux. Brown believes (no matter what anyone else says) that Linus copied Linux from Minix, which is a for-study-purposes-only Unix-like OS, written by the noted professor and author of famous Computer Science books like  Computer Networks  and  Operating Systems , Andrew S Tanenbaum.  2. Brown visited AST in Amsterdam to interview him for the book. AST surprisingly, supported Linus and said there was no reason to believe Linus did not write Linux on his own.  3. Brown hired someone to compare the initial versions of Linux, and the then available versions of Minix. The  urlLink conclusion of the comparison  was that no one had copied anything. The details are  urlLink  here .  4. Ken Brown didn't care what anyone said (still doesn't) and continued with his book. He published some excerpts of his forthcoming book, titled  Samizdat  (the excerpts, not the book). The excerpts, (funnily) can be  bought   urlLink  here . A press-release giving some detail about the study/book is  urlLink here .  5. Linus responded saying that Yes,  urlLink  "I was just a front-man for the real fathers of Linux, the Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus." .  6. Tanenbaum also responded with  urlLink  this information  about his interview with Ken Brown and other clarifications.  7.  urlLink  Followup  by AST on the issue.  8.  urlLink  Reply by Ken Brown  to Tanenbaum's response.  9.  urlLink  Rebuttal  by AST to Brown's response.   The reason Ken Brown approached Tanenbaum in the first place is probably because of Tanenbaum's Jan 1992 post on comp.os.minix called  urlLink Linux is Obsolete . I highly recommend reading the whole thing (if you are a geek) even though it's quite long. There's another interesting thread on similar lines which I came across a few years ago. It's related to this thread, I think. If someone knows what I'm talking about, please let me know. I'd printed both the threads out (came to be about 20-30 pages, I think, in small font) and read the whole stack.  I'll be back with more updates on this Soap Opera as it unfolds.  Appendix The  urlLink  Slashdot post  that pointed me to the latest stuff.     This blog is dedicated to my grandmother, who passed away at 5am IST on 9-June-2004.   I'll miss you, Nani.

						    Disclaimer - For conciseness (and to save time), I will skip some details that I consider basic in this series. I may come back to this post later and update it to be more step-by-step, but as of now, I won't do that. Questions are always welcome, and I'll try my best to keep these posts useful to as many people as possible.   I began using Emacs full-time, in March 2000, so my  .emacs  file had become somewhat large before I lost it. I guess this may be somewhat Greek to some of you, so I'll also give a bit of Emacs history and background information. For the impatient, this post is divided into the following sections. Just click on the one that interests you.   urlLink History and background   urlLink Using Emacs   urlLink Customizing Emacs     History and Background  Emacs, has its roots in Unix, though it started out as a set of macros written in 1976 at MIT by RMS (Richard Stallman) for the editor TECO under ITS on a PDP-10. It soon developed into a customizable editor that can today be used for everything from browsing your harddisk, programming (using practically any programming language ever developed), shell programming, accessing a database (including but not limited to Oracle, DB2, MySQL, SQL Server), version control (using CVS, Clearcase, SourceSafe and other tools), browsing the web, checking your mail, playing tetris, and more! Emacs even doubles up as your psychiatrist! (Help -> Emacs Pschiatrist)  Interested? Well, read on!    Using Emacs  To begin using Emacs (I'm assuming you're using Windows. If you're not, you're probably smart enough to change the below instructions to suit you anyway), you need to do the following:      Download the Emacs installer from http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/windows/emacs/ (download the  fullbin   tar.gz  file)     Extract it (Winzip can extract  tar.gz  files) to a convenient location on your hard-drive like  C:\      Execute   &lt;emacs-folder&gt;\bin\runemacs.exe   to start Emacs.     Once Emacs has started, press  Ctrl-h, t  to start the tutorial     Read the tutorial and follow it. This will teach you basic navigation within emacs - which is very different from how you normally do it in Windows. For example, the standard Ctrl-X, Ctrl-V for Copy/Paste doesn't work in Emacs by default. You can make it work, and there are packages like  cua.el  which enable a large number of windows-type key-bindings, but I don't recommend them. If you're using Emacs, you might as well get used to the default key-bindings, because sooner or later you  will  fall in love with them.     Read the manual. This is accessible from the menu at Help->Read The Emacs Manual.      Use Emacs as your editor exclusively for a few weeks (it took me around a month to become fully productive on Emacs with Java. This was mainly because of the time it took me to set up JDEE, so it might not be so bad for you if I can document the JDEE part on this blog). You might be tempted, because of the steep learning curve, to forget about the whole exercise. However, if you are patient, the rewards are indeed great.       Customizing Emacs  The Emacs initialization file - which is what you use to customize Emacs to work the way you want, is called ".emacs". You cannot create a file with this name directly in Windows, so you'll need to create it from within Emacs itself. (The alternative is to call the file "_emacs", but since you  can  create a .emacs file, this is no longer necessary). The location of this file, is your HOME directory. To find out the location of your HOME directory, type the following in a freshly opened command prompt (Type "cmd" under Start->Run, or "command.com" if you are using Windows 9x/Me).   prompt> echo %HOME%   If it gives you blank output, then you can assume this to be  C:\ . The HOME environment variable is not commonly found on Windows systems, but is important in the Unix World. Unixy applications assume a location of C:\ if one is not defined in your Environment Variable list.  One of the first things I do when I download Emacs and start with a new .emacs, is add these entries -    (setq default-frame-alist         '((top . 0)           (left . 190)           (width . 130)           (height . 66)           (font . "-outline-Lucida Console-normal-r-normal-normal-12-90-96-96-c-*-iso10646-1")       )         )    (global-set-key (quote [f3]) (quote other-window))   (global-set-key (quote [home]) (quote beginning-of-buffer))   (global-set-key (quote [end]) (quote end-of-buffer))   (global-set-key (quote [C-M-down]) (quote View-scroll-line-forward))   (global-set-key (quote [C-M-up]) (quote View-scroll-line-backward))    I've got quite used to them, and find them indispensible. The first bit, resizes and positions my emacs window on startup, and sets my default font to Lucida-Console, with a font size of 9. This is quite small but I have a large monitor, so you might want to decide what your favourite font and size are. To find out the right string for your font, do this.      Paste this in your *scratch* buffer:  (insert (prin1-to-string (w32-select-font)))       Keep the cursor at the end of the line that you just pasted, and press Ctrl-J. This will pop up a Font-selection dialog     Select the font, size and style of your choice.     Press Ok.     The string that Emacs pastes back in the *scratch* buffer, is the full name of your font.    For the resizing and positioning of the Emacs window, you can either delete those sections, or experiment and decide what works for you. The top and left parameters are pixel values, whereas width and height are measured in number of characters in your selected font.  The next bit from my  .emacs  file sets up my favourite key-bindings.  F3 , is the key I use to change buffers with a single key. The standard Emacs shortcut for this is  C-x o .  The  Home  key on Unix and older versions of Emacs on Windows takes you to the beginning of the file, and the  End  key takes you to the end of the file. In Windows editors, the standard behaviour is to take you to the beginning or the end of the line. I like the way Unix works, and having it behave differently on Windows confuses me when I have to work on a Linux machine. So I set these keys up appropriately. The last two, are for scrolling a file one line at a time, instead of by page. I like the Ctrl-Alt-Up and Ctrl-Alt-Down keys for this.  I also customize the following variables ( M-x customize-variable ):       blink-cursor  to  nil         delete-selection-mode  to  t       global-font-lock-mode  to  t       transient-mark-mode  to  t     The first turns off the blinking of the cursor, the second allows me to delete any selected text in one stroke using the  Del  key, the third turns on syntax-specific colouring for recognized file-types, and the last allows me to see selected text as highlighted.  Setting up Emacs with JDEE, Cygwin and other cool tools will be covered in future posts.  More soon.

						   After returning from my last trip to the US, I've been trying to setup the programming environment that I had on my PC before July 2003 (yes, I know, it's been a long time).  This  environment , basically comprises of the following:      Emacs (my editor of choice) set up with the JDEE, GNUClient, Save-Desktop, and a variety of key-bindings I've got used to over the years.     WinCVS     The latest JDK      Tomcat (Java Servlet Container from Apache - also the reference implementation of the Servlet/JSP spec)      JBoss (Open Source J2EE server)      Ant (Apache's Java build system - open source)      Keyboard-accessible shortcuts for starting various Windows programs     Cygwin (Open source Unix emulator for Windows)   Cygwin/X - to run GUI Linux apps on my Windows box instead of accessing a Linux PC over telnet   This environment, depends on the following infrastructure being available on the network:       1 Linux PC (preferably the latest version of RHL/Fedora)   CVS on Linux (I prefer it that way. Allows a lot of server-side scripting, which I haven't figured out for Windows yet)     1 Database server (I've chosen MySQL for now, to run on the Linux box)   Since the backup of my Emacs installation (mainly the .emacs file, but also the specific versions of the various packages that I'd downloaded at various points of time) is in some CD that I currently don't know the location of, and the PC I'm using was previously used by another experimentation-crazy colleague, I have a box that is far from the clean-room-type environment I like to start with, and I've had to start from scratch to set up my so-called  environment .  I'll be blogging here over the next few days about my progress, and also the various bottle-necks I run into. Hopefully it'll be helpful to some of you out there, and at the very least, will help me set it up again at some point in the future when I once again, lose my backup...

						   A friend of mine pointed out that  urlLink Sidin  has a hit counter on his site (it's at an impressibe 93,000+ at the time of this writing), and so I went ahead and grabbed one for myself. It's at GoStats.com. It provides statistics, and is free. (What else do I need?)  I've set it up on my  urlLink other blog , since there doesn't seem to be any support for using the same counter at two blogs, and keeping the counts separate. And I really don't want to sign up for two accounts with GoStats and then try to remember two usernames and passwords.  I got a counter face that fit in quite comfortably in my site, though, so that's a good thing. I wish Blogger gave stats.   Question of the week: So what's so techy about this post?
