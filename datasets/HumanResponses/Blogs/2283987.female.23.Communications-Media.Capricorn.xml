      It always makes me sad to see a college place kicker miss a game-winning or game-tying field goal at the very end of a game or in OT, especially when the guy then just stands there staring at the goalpost for a couple minutes after the other team starts going crazy, and his team leaves the field with their heads down. Of course, if it happens to kansas, I laugh.

      Today during lunch I saw a girl trying to parallel park her boat of a car. This task in and of itself would be difficult enough, but was impossible once the girl turned the car completely perpindicular to the curb. I wanted to yell "Lady, it's not a  urlLink  Smart Car! "

      I'm reading a  urlLink CNN article   about a girl suing Maury Povich. CNN always has a box in its articles that let you select "alert topics," so that if there's a story with this topic, it will be emailed to you. One of the "alert topic" options was Maury Povich. Seriously, outside of Connie Chung, is there anyone in the world who MUST KNOW everything they can about Maury, and if there's any news about him, they need to know NOW. If so, I hope I never meet these people.

      This isn't really a new thought, but I've been thinking about it this morning. I would LOVE to start a Mark Hamill online fan club, and ignore the fact that he was in Star Wars. Just talk about the video games, animated voices (did you know he was in The Little Mermaid?) and movie classics such as  urlLink  Laser Hawk.  Then I would giggle away when any Star Wars super-fans would say "What about Star Wars?!" Then I would say, "What's that? You can't just make up movies, pal."

      We listen to country at work. I hate it, but listening to Tim McGraw's "Don't Take the Girl" makes me think, exactly where does this character live that he both A) Goes to the local fishin' hole with his dad and neighbor girl and B) Gets mugged in front of the "picture show"? I hate country.

      This afternoon NDSCS hosted the Minneapolis Community and Technical College, whose mascot is the Marauders and their colors are red and purple. You read that right. Red and purple. I told the stat boy, "I feel confident in saying no self-respecting pirate would wear red with purple." Then he looked at me with a look that said, "I cannot believe I have to work with you for the next four hours."

      A man from Texas set a Guinness World Record for holding  urlLink nine snakes in his mouth  for 10 seconds. This beat the previous record of eight snakes. Of course, he held that record, too. And he plans on besting this record. Why keep doing it? If you're convinced you can do 12 snakes, why mess around with 8, 9, or 10? Do it once a be done, pal! Jackie "The Snakeman" Bibby has done TV appearances and the like to make money off this stunt, but was not paid for this record-breaking acheivement. In what may be my favorite line in the article, he did it "for the prestige, the glory and the attention." Yes, the glory of holding nine rattlesnakes in your mouth. One big question I have is, how do you come to find out you're capable of doing this? This is the way I imagine it: You are out camping with your friends, drunk beyond belief, when one says "Hey! I bet you can't put that rattlesnake in your mouth!" So, of course you prove  him wrong. You see the "prestige" holding a poisonous reptile in your mouth garners among your circle of friends, then decide to practice and improve so that one day EVERYONE will see the "glory" in your actions as you hold nine of them in your mouth and break your own world record. It's a life only a chosen few can aspire to lead.

      The SNL that ran during lunch featured musical guest Bjork. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think Bjork and SNL have the same audiences. In fact, I didn't know ANYONE listened to Bjork. Then, this big, jockish looking kid walks by and goes, in what sounded like a sincere tone, "Ooooh... Bjork!" What!? In my opinion, the best thing -- the ONLY thing -- Bjork ever did was appear on a very funny episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast. (She was Space Ghost's wife and wouldn't let him go with Zorak to throw lightbulbs in the dumpster.)

      I don't think I have what it takes to be a fan of a good team. I'm serious. The Royals about turned me grey since this is the first time in recent memory that their season didn't "end" in early June. Then, here come the Chiefs, and courtesy of the CBS stations in Fargo and Minneapolis, I have to try to follow their game via yahoo game tracker and by calling my brother who is listening to it.  Mizzou is playing for the Big XII North title next week. I'll have an ulcer by then. And don't even get me started on the Tiger basketball team. It used to be much easier, back when all my teams were really bad.

      I woke up this morning, and my first thought was, "I should check and make sure the Chiefs are on TV!" Now, wouldn't you think the closest AFC team would garner CBS coverage, escpecially when said team is 9-0? I thought so, so I wasn't too worried while checking TVGuide.com. But, much to my dismay, I saw that both CBS stations I get are showing Baltimore at Miami. Now I'm no geography whiz, but aren't both Cincinnati and Kansas City closer to Fargo and Minneapolis than either Baltimore or Miami? Stupid "regional" coverage. I should buy them USA maps! And, the best part, I woke up at 7:30 worrying about this, and now I can't go back to sleep. Guess I'll go watch cartoons.

      For about a half second, I was upset that I missed the Real World Season Finale last night. Then I remembered it will probably be on MTV 1000 more times before Christmas, so I'll still get to see it. I honestly am a little sad. I really liked this cast. Except Adam, that guy was a tool. But, he did add a lot of unintentional comedy, especially when he would rap in the confessional. Oh, you can't make up stuff like that, folks.

      1. You spend half an hour watching VH1's Spice Girls Behind the Music hoping to see shots of Dave Beckham, and there aren't many. (But, I'm not going to lie. Seeing Dave was just an excuse. Deep down, I wanted to know the stories behind those five plucky Brits. Girl Power!) 2. You laugh for five minutes when one of the "good-looking" guys from "Average Joe" says to the girl "I'm really into the important things in life. God. Animals. Those are the things that really matter." 3. You realize you probably won't see grass in the yard again until March. And, I don't even have a yard.

      A small town in Kansas is  urlLink requiring residents to buy guns.  Any households not complying will be fined $10. Not everyone has to buy a gun, though. "Those who suffer from physical or mental disabilities, paupers and people who conscientiously oppose firearms would be exempt," according to the CNN article. Paupers? Do they really have a lot of "paupers" in a Kansas town of 210? Does anyone still use the word pauper? "Yeah, I was at the intersection, and this pauper had a sign that said 'Vet needs help. God Bless You.' I think it may have been Tilt."

      The "All-Christmas" station I'm listening to is playing his song "Angels," from "The Ego Has Landed." Good song? Yes. Christmas song? No. This is the second time they've played Robbie on this station, which is definitely NOT a bad thing. The first song, however, WAS a Christmas song, called "Walk This Sleigh." That Robbie is so funny...

      I think it's well documented that I dislike country music, and I hate listening to it while at work. So, I've been listening to streaming-audio radio stations now, and since it IS the holiday season, I've been listening to the Christmas music stations. One of them is labeled "Festivus Christmas." Am I crazy, but isn't Festivus the fake holiday the Costanzas celebrate?

      I know I've said a lot of bad things about the country station that I'm forced to listen to while at work. Well, not listen to, but hear... anyway, today they almost totally redeemed themselves for playing "I Love This Bar" 15 times a day. That's right, they played the best Spanglish Christmas Song Ever!!! FELIZ NAVIDAD!!! I love that song!! (Which, by the way is what I meant the title to say. It's been 5 years since I've taken Spanish, and I don't remember if it's "This and These have Ts" or "This and That have Ts." I went with This and These, so my That has no T. Not sure if that's right. Anyway, I apoligize to all  you Spanish speakers for butchering your language. And also, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas, from the bottom of my heart...)

       Pro:  I love Christmas music!  Con:  Stations really have to stretch to cover 24 hours of Christmas music without playing the same songs over and over. This means, of course, they must play some crappy music at times. I'm talking about the Christmas songs written in the past 5-10 years. There has not been a good Christmas song written lately. I'm convinced there are no good Christmas songs left to be written. It's done. If you're an aspiring composer, don't even mess with creating a holiday song, because there aren't any left. Not any good ones, anyways.  Pro:  Two words: Feliz Navidad. Man, I love that song!  Con:  Stylized Christmas Carols. If the original song has one note per word, there is no reason to glide all over the scale when you sing that word.  This is a perfect example of why I should be in charge of a music tribunal that must approve all musical remakes.  Pro:   Bing Crosby. On the radio. Does it get any better?  Con:  Back to the crappy new Christmas songs. "Christmas Shoes"? Nice sentiment, crappy song. Neither a pro nor a con, but something that's been bothering me: I frankly am quite amazed that  urlLink "Silent Night"  rhymes. Seriously, it was written to rhyme in German, but it also rhymes in English! This leads me to believe one of two things happened:1) Mohr and Gruber were geniuses and wrote a beautiful carol that rhymes in any language 2) Translators took liberties with the translations. If ever in my life I write a song that rhymes in multiple languages, I will consider it a life well spent.

      Last night I caught a little bit of VH1's Big in '03. I flipped to it while they were in the middle of parading out all kinds of reality TV stars. Then, they named the biggest reality star of 2003. Drumroll... Evan Mariott -- the original Joe Millionaire. The best part, he accepted the "award" in honor of his aunt who fighting cancer. I wanted to yell at him, "Hey, pal! It's not really an award! You can't give "thanks" speeches for a fake award. It's a great, big joke, and you're the butt of it! Don't accept that in honor of your aunt! She's going through enough as it is!!!"

      - The trip from CP to Wahpeton (which I've made 3 times in the last 6 weeks...ugh.) goes by a lot faster when you listen to the following: 1) Robbie Williams 2) The Chiefs game 3) Christmas Music!!! - My cousins and I went to see "Elf" as our post-Thanksgiving traditional movie. I loved it. This was the best part: The characters in the movie begin singing Christmas Carols to raise the Christmas spirit. Then, the man sitting next to us starts singing along, loudly, as if he expects everyone in the theater to start singing, too. I almost cried. - I love the stations that switch to an All-Christmas Music format following Thanksgiving. (More on this later.) - At first I was very, very angry when kU got a bid to a bowl game. But, then I realized, when they lose, they'll finish with a losing season. Yippee!!! - I have a new challenge. Keeping four, count them four, houseplants alive.

      There's one song they play on the station here, (maybe it's called "Love's been a little hard bit on me" -- that's the chorus, anyway) that every time I hear it, I get a little excited because the beginning sounds a LOT like the theme song to Alvin and the Chipmunks. Then, I realize that, sadly, a country station would probably not be playing that. It's an emotional rollercoaster here, I tell you!

      Last night I was getting into my car, and the driver's side seat is covered with these chunks of ice, all on the back and seat. I look on the driver's side window, also covered with ice on the inside. "What?!" I'm thinking. I check to make sure the window is rolled all the way up. It is. Then I find the culprit. In the cupholder. My can of Diet Dr. Pepper (Thanks, Jill!) from the night before had exploded and then froze in its explosion pattern. One point for exploding pop. Well, I'm late for my destination, so I say, "No time to clean this off!" and I just get a blanket from the backseat and sit on it. I'm just driving across town, no big deal. The windshield has a little frost on it, but I figure it's nothing that will prevent me from driving the 2 miles I'm going. I'm not even halfway across the parking lot, when I realize, I can't see. So I stop in the middle of the parking lot (it's empty) to scrape my windshield. I also try the trick that I seem to always try, but I don't remember it ever working. Windshield wiper fluid. Maybe this works in Missouri when it's around 30, but it doesn't work in ND when it's -3. But, I kept driving, with the windshield wipers going and the fluid still refreezing on the outside. Also, I'm getting a thin lair of frost inside. I pull onto the street, then freak because I can't see at all. So I just stop. I would have pulled over, but I couldn't tell if there were parked cars or not. After sitting in the street for about 30 seconds and trying the wiper fluid trick again, I rolled down my window and did my best Ace Ventura impersonation so that I could drive the 20  yards to the parking lot up ahead. One point for making me stick my head out of my car in -3 degree weather.  (Side note, not related to weather. When I finally got to my destination, the people I was meeting weren't there. I was at the wrong bar. When I finally met them, it was 25 minutes after I left my apartment. It should have taken 5-10 minutes to get there. Grrr.) And the final point is for this being one of the first things I heard this morning, which prevented me from leaving my warm covers which resulted in me being late to work: "Current temperature, 12 below."

      I'll admit, I've been frequenting Tigerboard this afternoon. I can't help it. I worry. What made me laugh was there are post after post after post discussing Ricky Clemons, then you scroll down, and there's a post that says, "Boy that TJ Soyoye sure could pump fake." If that doesn't make you laugh out loud, I don't know what will! Oh, the days when all we had to worry about was if TJ would pump once, twice or three times before maybe getting off a shot.

      There's a commercial where a guy comes up to his past self and starts spouting all this advice: "Take the job in Boston! Don't date Becky! Trust me! I'm you in the future!" If I had a time machine, I'd take now-Quin Snyder to talk with circa 2001 Quin Snyder and just have him say: "Don't even think about talking to Ricky Clemons. And, keep your hair long."

Has there ever been a player in Mizzou history this embarassing? Not that I can remember. I think no Missouri player should ever wear the number 00 again.

      First, Bob goes and picks the wrong girl. I didn't watch Average Joe as diligently as I did The Bachelor, but I did watch last night's episode, and let me just tell you Melana did not do KC proud. Let me just run down what I gathered to be the positive qualities of each guy. Adam (or Average Joe): 27 and owns his own trading company on Wall Street Smart, Funny, Personable, Sincere He seemed really taken by Melana  Jason (The "Looker"): Pretty eyes  Naturally, she picked Jason. The boy who uses more filler words than real words. I don't care what side of the State Line Melana lives on, the only explanation I can come up with is that she's from KCK.  And finally, Andrew Firestone and Jen from the Bachelor have broken up!

      I think USC Cornerback Will Poole is on the right track as to the real concerns surrounding this BCS mess...  From  urlLink  ESPN.com ... "I learned a little about life in general," Poole said. "You can't let a computer make decisions for you. Computers are going to take over. The next thing you know, everybody is going to be out of a job. Computers are going to play football. If you let computers run the world, what are humans going to do?"  It reminds me of an old Sega game where robots played baseball, and there were mines in the outfield. Robot players cost more than humans, but boy were they fast and could they hit!!!  PS- I think OU deserves to be in the Sugar Bowl.

      This weekend was the perfect example of how I let sports have too much of an influence on my emotional state. Saturday, the whole world was perfect, because MU won and ku lost. Then, Sunday afternoon I went into a "we-just-got-our-asses-handed-to-us-by-Denver" induced coma and didn't do anything after the game ended. Anyway, some sports-related thoughts from the weekend that was. *MU vs. Indiana Kara Moran Player of the Game award goes to.... Travon Bryant. Following the game, I received a very angry phone call from my sister demanding I take back everything bad I've ever said about my favorite No. 5 not named George Brett or Jason Sutherland. I replied, "Yeah, it was so good to see him try for the entire game." Which set off more anger on her part. But, c'mon, Jeffrey "Bird Man" Ferguson started ahead of him last year. Jeffrey Ferguson!!! He's Canadian, for crying out loud!!! *At one point in the Mizzou game I thought to myself, "I wish I knew the Lithuanian National Anthem, because I'd sing it right now." * AJ looks like he lost a lot of weight. Don't worry, though, because I found it. On Quin Snyder. Not that that's bad. For the first time since joining the Tigers, Q doesn't look like he has an eating disorder. Or an illegal drug habit. *Speaking of Quin, I'm not sure I'm digging the haircut. (And I'm certain I'm not diggng the sweaty shirt-collar. What was that?!) * It was so nice for once to be on the winning end of a come-from-behind, I-can't-believe-what-I'm-watching victory. *Mark my words, if I ever meet Steve Lavin, I will kick him in the shin. I can't remember a game where I've yelled, "SHUT UP!!!" at the color man more. And that's saying something, because I do that a lot. Note to Steve: When  you're broadcasting a nationally televised game, you try for a little neutrality. That means, at no point should you say "Hopefully Indiana can get out of here with a win, then Coach Davis can go have some laughs with his friend Bill Cosby." NOOOO!!! You're a sports broadcaster! You have NO HOPES!!!! *Three things became painfully obvious during Sunday's Chiefs game. 1) Clinton Portis is really, really fast. 2) The Chiefs run defense is really, really bad 3) If KC doesn't finish with homefield advantage, our Super Bowl hopes move to 2005.

      Two of my aunts gave me four house plants over Thanksgiving. These plants terrified me. They just sat in the corner, daring me to keep them alive, when they knew very well that they hold the upper hand. I was so afraid of over-watering, that I probably waited too long to water, and when I did water, it was not much. So, my plants became very wilty. Well, when it reached the point that none of them were standing up straight, I figured, what do I have to lose? And, I gave them all great big drinks. The next morning, with my anticipation reaching Christmas Morning levels, I ran out into the living room to see all four plants healthy and standing tall. Well, one is still a  little  wilty, but I can tell it will pull through.

What would be YOUR method of media-based torture? Here are my ideas. For music: "I Love This Bar" on repeat. (This would be very similar to working in my office.) I haven't thought of what TV show I would use for a torture device. As for movies, maybe I'd make him watch "The Thirteenth Warrior." Not even repeatedly. Just once ought to be enough.

      Just call me Susie Homemaker. Last night I finished the peanut butter cookies (grand total: 115, total burnt: 24). I also started the buckeyes, but I got to talking on the phone and ended up not dipping them in the chocolate. That's on the agenda for Bake-O-Rama Day 3, which is tonight. I also made enough dough for 6 dozen sugar cookies, but when I tried cutting the shapes the shape wouldn't stay, so I put that back in the refrigerator so it could chill more. This is possibly THE most boring entry yet. Here are some things I learned during the Bake-O-Rama: *Shortening is disgusting. *If you're going to have a Bake-O-Rama, you should have more than one measuring cup and more than two mixing bowls, otherwise it's a Bake/Dishwashing-O-Rama. *If you add too much food coloring to melted white chocolate, the whole consistency gets thrown off and the pretzel-dipping project ends. * The supply of Christmas sprinkles in Breck/Wahp grocery stores is less than the demand.  I missed the boat on that one.

      I don't know when I became a baseball junkie, I think it's been very recent, but I can't get enough of these hot-stove reports.  Anyway, it seems  urlLink  Nomar   might have a change of laundry, as he trades in his Red Sox for those of the White variety. Of course, by the time anyone reads this, the whole deal might fall through. Or, he could be playing for a team in the same division as the Royals, and I don't like the thought of that one bit. Not that Ordonez is a bad player. I guess it would be okay. Or, best case scenario, the White Sox could trade Ordonez for Nomar, then trade Nomar somewhere else to cut salary. (I almost wrote "to save cap space." Wouldn't that be nice if there was a cap to worry about!)

I've watched Charlie Brown's Christmas special, and the end of It's a Wonderful Life. I've even been baking Christmas cookies, and as the song says, "Christmas cookies and holiday hearts, that's the way the holiday starts..." But, I don't feel the holiday starting...

      Everytime I mentioned the Montana trip to my mom, she would sing the above line. I think she made up the song, but she swears it's real. Anyway, some things from the Montana trip... -- I've never been happier to be short than while riding on the NDSCS bus. I sat across the aisle from one of our 6'7" guards, and he did not look comfortable at all the entire trip. It was a little hazardous sitting across from him, too, because he stretched out across the aisle and had his feet on the armrest on the outside chair in my row (I was sitting by the window) while he was taking a nap. Occasionally, and I do this while I nap, too, he would move suddenly. I got kicked twice.  -- After getting kicked  couple times, I stretched out my legs to see if they even reached across the aisle. Not even close. --We stopped at a gas station in western North Dakota on the way out. There was a "For Sale" ad posted on the bulletin board with a picture of the item for sale. The picture looked like a tree stump. Huh? Who buys a tree stump? -- I feel confident the crowd at the Miles City game had the highest number of cowboy hats per capita of anyplace I've ever been. And my 6th grade field trip was to a rodeo. -- Not to be outdone by the fans in Miles City, the Dawson CC women's coach "cowboyed up," wearing a turquoise-studded, giant belt buckle. Never again will I complain about one of Quin's outfits. -- We have a player on the women's team from Watertown, S.D. -- the hometown of one Jason Sutherland. Her parents came to the game, and we talked about old number five, how scrappy he was, how he got a lot of T's, how it wasn't HIS fault Tyus Edny broke the hearts of every Tiger fan... it was good fun. They said their HS gym, which holds 4,000, would be full at 4:00 when he played at 7:00. Man, I love that guy! -- Before loading the bus on Sunday morning, I was watching Fox News in the hotel lobby, and some of the men's team were eating breakfast. As I surveyed the people in the room, it hit me, I was the ONLY American there. I was surrounded by Canadians. They kept yapping about how the American media always spins it so the USA is the hero, and so on and so forth. One guy even said, "Just be the bad guy, for once!" It was a very strange experience, watching a major world event surrounded by people with a totally different perspective. -- When I still wanted to work in TV, one of my biggest fear was ending up in Glendive, Mont., the smallest media market in the USA. I was sure that if I worked there, I'd have to run a crank to get the tower working. Well, I faced my former fear this weekend when I visited Glendive, home of Dawson Community College. Let me tell you, my fears were rational. The Wahp's no hot spot, but Glendive...yikes. -- Here's a question. What do you do when your printer gets a paper jam? You unjam it, right? Well, the women's coaches disagree, and they would not let me use "unjam" in our on-bus scrabble game. Grrrr. -- This weekend was good for my morale. I realized that if I decide to make this my career path, I would be doing more of the things I did this weekend, and less pretending to be busy in my office. I really had a lot of fun with the teams. It was fun to finally see the personalities of some of the players. They're a fun bunch of kids. I like them so much, in fact, that if I get really excited during the Great Bake-O-Rama scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, I might just make them all cookies for their next road trip. -- Speaking of cookies, the parents I mentioned before were so nice. The mom made me give her my address here, because "Maybe I'll feel like sending you a care package or something. It's just the Mom in me!" Whoo hooo! Potential cookies!!! -- Miles had programs that I'm assuming were sponsored by Pepsi, as they had three large Pepsi logos on the inside. Along the bottom of the page were pictures of officials and explanations of what officials' signals mean. For example, they showed a guy with his hands on his hips, and below it said "Blocking." The last signal had a guy with his hand over his head, and below him it said "Have a Pepsi." Of all the years I've spent involved in the sport of basketball, I never knew "Have a Pepsi" had an official signal...

      Last night my boss had a Christmas party at his house. We were supposed to bring something sweet to share. I was so tired of baking and had not budgeted for Christmas party cookies, so I went to the grocery store and bought frosted sugar cookies, much like the gifts from God that you can purchase at your local Wal-Mart. We had a lot of cookies left over, so my boss brought them into work and had them in his office. When I was over there for our staff meeting this afternoon, another lady who works in his building stuck her head in the office and said, "You make such delicious sugar cookies!" I just laughed and said, "Me? Those were store bought!" She then told me I had everyone fooled. MWAHAHAAHAHAHA!!! The Trickster strikes again!

      The inaugural Bake-O-Rama also provided a little lesson in AP Style. The phrase "First Annual" is one of my personal pet peeves. I explain to offenders that there's no such thing as a "first annual" anything, because in order to be "annual" it must happen on a yearly basis and if it's the first time it happened, it can't have happened on a yearly basis. A lot of times, the person will reply "What if you PLAN on it happening every year." Well, just because you plan it doesn't mean it will happen. I had planned on making the Bake-O-Rama an annual event, my repertoire of Christmas recipes growing each year until I reached a Martha Stewart level of craftiness in the kitchen. However, after removing the charred remains of multiple forgotten batches of cookies from the oven, nearly removing the tip of my left pinky, having my hands and arms (and after I touched it, my eye) break out after contact with cinnamon oil and spending every waking hour of the past week baking, baking, baking, yet still having to get up early this morning to finish, I can promis you I will NEVER HAVE ANOTHER BAKE-O-RAMA. EVER. I normally LOVE frosted sugar cookies, but now the sight of them turns my stomach.

I never would have thought so much blood could come out of one little appendage. And, I didn't have any bandages, so I just wrapped it up with a paper towl and got a band-aid at work. Oh, yeah. It's shaping up to be a great day.

      Houston Nutt  urlLink turned down the  $2 million a year head coaching job at NEBRASKA to stay at ARKANSAS. Does this seem crazy to anyone else. Also, how embarassing is it to have a guy turn down your job to coach at Arkansas. I can't get over this.

      So, it looks like  urlLink Nebraska offered Houston Nutt  of Arkansas the head coaching job. And he's considering it. What's to consider? You coach at Arkansas?! And you have a chance to not only leave Arkansas, but also to make $2 million in the process!!! Yes, Nebraska fired their coach after his team was 9-3 (10-3 after the bowl, and I think Frank should get credit for that win, too. It was his kids, his program.). BUT, don't you think the REAL reason he was fired was because he was 7-7 the year before and Pederson didn't think he'd have the clout as a new AD to fire the head football coach? That's what I think. I also wonder why on earth Nebraska would want Nutt. "Yes, Husker fans, we fired our  9(10)-3 coach to bring in a guy that finished 9-4. But,  he DID beat Missouri and Texas..."  If you ask me, Steve Pederson is crazy. You might even say he's "Nutts". Ba dum ching.

       urlLink MU backup QB Sonny Riccio is transferring.  But, it's on good terms. He just knows he'll never play ahead of Bradley Smith, who is the same age as Sonny. We'll always have the memory of your fake FG touchdown pass against Nebraska, Sonny. Also, Nebraska hired Callahan. How can I cheer for that? (Second-favorite team, mind you.)

      Watch Out! Here Comes Kara! is the name of my first fake band. Other fake bands I've been in: 1) The Ufs -- In Spanish my favorite word was "iUf!" just an expression with no meaning, although we said it translated into "D'oh!" Anyway, this was a Spring Break 2001 specialty starring Jill, Britt and Audrey. Our hit song: an  amazing   cover of The Bloodhound Gang's "The Roof is on Fire." 2) Kara and the Jets -- This is going to be an Elton John cover band. The trouble with this band is three-fold. 1)No one wants to be in the band with me. 2) I have no musical talent. 3) I don't really know very many (read: any) Elton John songs. Don't get me wrong, I know a LOT of the choruses, but that's it.

      I'll admit, I registered on classmates.com. I mean, c'mon, who  wouldn't   need help keeping track of all 53 other people in the NPHS class of '99. Anyway, some guy named David Adams signed up saying he graduated in our class. LIAR!! There was NO David Adams at North Platte circa 1995-99. Although, my friends and I did play a fun game over break. Randomly say a name, and if people reply in an "I  totally    forgot about him/her" manner, you get a point. This may only be fun for people from small schools. I'd imagine at larger schools getting that reaction would be easier.

      Some Polish divers are in some trouble after giving  urlLink champagne to a freshly caught pike at a New Year's party.  I would just like these Polish fishermen to know that if you soak fish eggs in creatin to see the effects, and then the fish die, you would likely be thrown out of the science fair for voluntarily killing vertebrates. Or, so I've heard, anyway...

      But, SI's Seth Davis makes me feel better when he wrote this about Missouri in an article discussing college teams' stock:  MISSOURI -- BUY: This has to be one of the best Buys of all time. The Tigers have dropped completely out of the polls after being ranked third in early December. Yes, they have been hurt by the Ricky Clemons scandal, and that home loss to Belmont is as bad as it gets. But they are working through rotation and chemistry issues as they integrate three players they didn't have before -- Jason Conley, Randy Pulley and Kevin Young -- into the lineup. Mizzou has nowhere to go but up, and up it shall go.   WHOO HOO!!! Up it shall go!!!

      On Tuesday, two of my coworkers told me I act too old for my age. This is not to mean I'm wise beyond my years, no, they said I need to start acting younger. This really bothered me, as many of you know I have a big age complex anyway. So, to rebel, I didn't iron my pants on Wednesday. Take that! Then I realized, I don't act like an old lady, I'm just really, really lame.

      Of the  urlLink three candidates you talked to yesterday , my pick would be Turner Gill. He's an insider, he maintains the continuity Nebraska has had for more than half a century. Bo Pelini? Schmuck. Who complains to another coach, on the field, about running up the score? Especially when you coach at Nebraska, one of the biggest blow-out offenders. Bill Callahan, (who it sounds like is your first choice)? Jerk. His own players in Oakland had to restrain other players so he wouldn't be beaten up in the locker room. There's a motivator for you. It doesn't concern you at all that he took a Super Bowl team to 4-12 this season? I don't see the Husker Nation rallying around him. Now, Gill. They've loved Gill since the early '80s. He's one of them. He bleeds Big Red, for other than biological reasons. Go with Gill!!

      I was on The Weather Channel web page, and I was going to save my location because I'm getting too lazy to enter my ZIP every time I check the weather. Well, you have to enter a name for it's "greeting" when you register. At first, I was just going to put "Kara," but on second thought, I thought it would make it a lot more fun to check the weather if The Weather Channel called me "Dude." So, that's the name I entered. I hoped it would say, "Dude, the high today is -5." Which, I think is the best way to find out the high is -5. But, it doesn't. It just says "Good afternoon, Dude." Still makes me smile, though.

      The weather got three points today, as the cold caused the following things to happen, each worth one point. 1) My CD player in my car wouldn't work. 2) The moisture inside my nose froze. 3) There was frost on my interior rear-view mirror. I was telling a kid I work with that I was telling my mom we probably wouldn't see double digits at all this week. His reply: "We probably will... they'll just be negative." Hooray.

      Last night I got home from work, put on my pajamas, crawled under my fleece blanket and was ready to just sit on the couch and be warm. Until I remembered I had movies that needed to be returned. D'oh! On the bright side, I decided I would get a muffin from the new Apple Barrel Cafe just a block from the movie rental place. I was very excited about this muffin. Until, I get there and it's closed. Closed at 7:30. Who runs this town, Puritans? You can't get any food here after 10:00. And, you can't get a drink on Sunday after 8:00. And, you can't buy alcohol in the grocery stores. But, don't worry, you want casinos, we got casinos.

      It seems all the MU administrators are disappointing me. First, Elson's wife gets "involved" with the player who won't be named, then Chancellor Richard Wallace says we need to  urlLink tone down the rivalry with kU.  WHAT!?!?!!! Just because you're retiring in August doesn't mean you should break out the crazy quotes, pal. He says incidents like the fight between the women's basketball teams are embarrassing. Are you kidding me?! That fight made me proud. It showed they cared. What was his thought process, exactly. "Hmmm... we're a part of one of the oldest, greatest rivalries in college sports. We need to get rid of that in a hurry." Seriously, anyone who has the option of living on the quad should never, ever entertain such a thought. I'm livid, about this, absolutely livid.

      But, I absolutely love their commercials. They're Brilliant! I especially love the one where the guys wake up on St. Pat's morning, they're all decked out in green, their house is decorated, and they're going "It's St. Patrick's Day! It's St. Patrick's Day!" and they run downstairs to find Guinness wrapped as gifts. The tagline is something along the lines of "Treat St. Patrick's Day like a real Holiday." What I love best about this commercial is that they're running it in January. And, it makes me feel justified in being a little disappointed when I noticed the NJCAA National tournament, in which NDSCS will hopefully be participating, is the week of St. Patrick's Day. Like that ruins any big St. Pat's plans. I have a feeling St. Patrick's Day isn't a really big deal in this very Norwegian neck of the woods. But, still, I need to celebrate my favorite non-Jesus related holiday, and if I have to celebrate it (read: drink) by myself (likely), so be it.

      Sometimes Google pisses me off. I love it as a search engine, but I don't spell well, and I feel like sometimes Google is mocking me. For example, say I'm searching for The Montreal Gazette. Maybe when I type it, I go crazy and type "Montreal Gazzette." Google comes back up "Did you mean: Montreal   Gazette  ?" The bold and italics makes me imagine Google saying the corrected word to me in a very snide, condesending tone. Like that kid in class who feels the need to correct the teacher, when everyone knows the teacher just misspoke. Everyone makes mistakes, Google! You don't have to make them feel badly about it!

      One day, in the grocery store, a crazy man approached my mom and asked her if she thought the grapes were any good, because if you buy good grapes it can make your whole world happy. (That wasn't the really crazy part. I believe he went on to say that sometimes those sons of bitches charge too much, and so on and so forth. My mom just wanted some produce.) Anyway, he's right! Sometimes, small things can make your whole world happy. For example, today, it made my morning when I remembered I had just purchased a new chapstick! Happy, Happy Day!

      If he called Kleiza a "Tazmanian Devil" one more time, I might have screamed. Does he have absolutely NO sense of geography? Lithuania is not the same as Tasmania, my friend. Grrr. I also heard him use the term "whirly dervish" twice. I've never heard that phrase, outside of "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria" from "Sound of Music." But, my favorite line was when he said, "Syracuse doesn't use much of their bench. They usually only go about 6 and a half, 7 guys deep." WHAT!?!?! Yeah, I've always said one of the most important members of a successful basketball team is their 6 1/2th man. Grrrrr. I understand that it's hard to do color for a basketball game and I wouldn't want someone analyzing everything I say, but why on earth would you even think of that? Half people?

      Rob came down from Fargo to watch the game. Sadly, our combined Tiger spirit must not have made it all the way to CoMO. Anyway, here are the highlights (not-so-low-lights?)... 1) After Josh Kroenke misses a free throw -- Rob: "What!? You're white!" 2) With Missouri down 4 in the final seconds of OT -- Rob: "Don't do anything stupid." Ron Franklin: "Arthur Johnson for three." 3) That time Rickey Paulding made both his free throws. Oh, wait... 4) Did it freak out anyone else how quiet it was in Hearnes when we were shooting free throws? I thought the sound was off for a second.

Now, call me crazy, but maybe a minister's belief in God shouldn't hinge on his 17-year-old daughter signing a record contract with Columbia.

      Georgia may  urlLink ban the word "evolution"  from its school curriculum. Now, they aren't going to be like kansas, and ban the teaching of the theory of evolution. They're just going to teach the theory without calling it "evolution". They're going to call it "biological changes over time." They aren't replacing text books, and the teachers can still use the word in the classroom. This is just to pacify hillbilly parents who think only creationism should be taught. It's like the state dept. of education thinks they'll be fooled if the curriculum doesn't actually have the word "evolution" on it. You know, they just might be right.

      I'll admit, I call all my teams "we" even though I have absolutely no role with them. And, I know I'm not the only one to do this. (In psychology, it's called "Basking in the Reflective Glory.") Anyway, in a Hanes commercial, Michael Jordan says, "I think this could be the most comfortable underwear we've ever made." What? I don't think YOU have ever made ANY underwear! Since when are you a Hanes employee? I don't think you're toiling away to make boxers and briefs, MJ. You just hock them on TV. So, if Jordan can say "we" talking about Hanes, I can say "we" talking about Mizzou, the Royals, and the Chiefs.

      In an AP article about American Idol, the author says while the idea is to find America's next pop star, finalists really don't turn out to be "stars." To illustrate this, he (or she) writes: "Though brand-new to show biz, Clay Aiken already seems primed to take up permanent residence in Branson, Missouri, performing nightly at Clay Aiken theater." While I agree, I think it's interesting that the Pop Idol finalists -- Garreth Gates, with his perfectly aligned spikey hair, and Will Young, with his horrific cover of "Light My Fire," -- seemed very popular in the UK.  The biggest question, however, is why I even read that article despite having never watched an episode. Still, I did enjoy the promos with the guy who many fomer FARCers point out was very Johnny-esque.

      According to the  urlLink Fargo Forum , this is the worst cold stretch the area has had in eight years. If I ruled the world, I'd have a certain temperature, where as soon as it dropped below that, you have to give the temperature in Kelvin. The benefits to this are many. First, you don't feel as bad about going outside when it's 243 K as when it's -28 F. Just saying "negative" in relation to temperature makes me feel cold! Of course, then we'd give temperatures in Celcius in the summer, so we'd have temperatures that never get above the 50s. That's comfortable! Also, think how smart we would be! We would have a solid grasp on Farenheit, Celcius and Kelvin. And, then all that converting and learning you did in school would have some use. By the way, it's supposed to "warm up" next week (double digits! On the positive side! Whoo!), so I'm just about done complaining about the cold. Probably.

       urlLink Scott's discovery of a local Chipotle,  and my ensuing lamentation over not having a Chipotle or a Sonic anywhere near me got me thinking. Do I want to spend the next year and a half in a similar situation? Thus, I checked some of the cities where I'm considering going to grad school for both establishments. The verdict: Wichita has both, so bonus points for them. Louisville and Norfolk, Va. have neither, so negative points for them. ODU does have Jill proximity points, however. Of course, if I don't get my act together and start sending out the applications, it's all a moot point. And, we don't want that, because there are no Chipotles or Sonics in CPMO, either.

Nope, instead, it was just almost out of paper. Not out of paper, almost, so it didn't pull the paper up into the machine. Stupid engineers. Why wouldn't they design a fax machine that works until the paper is completely gone, not almost gone. Grrrr. And, then, I got a paper cut opening a package of paper to fill the not-empty fax machine. Good thing it's almost five.

That was great." *"Eric Piakowski is a chump." *"Who names a state 'Nebraska'?" *"Nebraska, Scmebraska" *"Columns are better than Corn." *"Barry Collier, you are probably going to be fired." Anyway,  she   thought those were all stupid. But, I was on the spot! It's hard to be clever on the spot. So, I'm planning ahead for the next home game, where we take on the very vicious KSU Wildcats. Ideas so far: * The classic: "You can't spell 'Suck' without KSU." *"Those throwback uniforms you wore last year were hideous." *"Ooohh... Purple... Don't you look tough." Anyway, I'll keep thinking. Feel free to post ideas. I'm sure Kristi would appreciate it.

       urlLink While George Bush was speaking at a prayer breakfast  a sound similar to automatic-weapon fire went through the sound system.  "It was just simply a wacky interaction between wireless mikes and the sound system and nothing more," said White House deputy press secretary Trent Duffy following the speech. "It was not a 21-gun salute."   This statement makes me like Trent Duffy for two reasons: 1) He used the word "wacky." 2)He either made a joke at the end, becuase let's face it, they were inside, people probably assumed it was not a 21-gun salute, or he really thought people might think it was a salute, which is even funnier.

      So, the thing that's amazed me the most when watching American Idol over the last two days is how many people forget the words. Seriously, folks. You have one day to learn one song. And, it's not like these are obscure songs, either. I think I could have done as well with the lyrics (not with the actually singing, of course) on "Can't Hurry Love."  And, what really got me was when people started forgetting the songs they wrote. Now, I'm not saying it would be easy to write and memorize a song and lyrics in 14 hours, but maybe when you forget the lyrics, just ad lib it. You made up the song! They won't know the right words!

All three of these shows were shows that when I first heard about them I thought they sounded absolutely ridiculous, and that there was no way I would ever watch any of them. Now, I'm hooked. I don't know what I'm going to do. Too many viewing options! Oh, and I caught a bit of RR/RW: The Inferno.

If I knew a Patriots fan, I would totally send a "Congrats on your team winning the championship" card. And, think of all the "There's always next year" cards you could send! You could have some that are genuine, and some that are totally smart-alecky. I would have sent more than my fair share of "Ha, ha! Told you my team is better!" cards after the MU win over Nebraska. Seriously, I should quit my job and develop this idea further.

So, I'm watching the game on tape delay. In Kara World (which, I'm not going to lie, is kind of a scary place) the game doesn't even tip off until probably 11. This means, no Internet after 8, and I'm not going to answer my cell phone after 8 if I see it's from someone with an interest in the game. What does one wear to work on a day with such importance? Well, I opted for my "I HATE kU." T-shirt. Granted, I have an NDSCS sweatshirt over it, but I think it's sending the negative vibes to all the hayjockers down in lawrence.

      So, the Super Bowl failed to produce a score that had a sum ending in three. However, here are some thoughts that it (and the commercials) did provoke: * Adam Vinateiri, you are one lucky SOB * When Carolina scored to bring the score to 21-16, then went for 2, why did Phil Simms disagree with this? In my book, if you don't convert, there is no difference to being down 4 or 5. But, if you get it there's a huge difference between being down 3 or 4. I think Simms is just jealous b/c the option wasn't around when he played. * While I found Justin and Janet's halftime "wardrobe malfunction" humorous, the funny factor is amplified by the fact that it was on CBS, the network that pulled "The Reagans" for being too controversial. * Speaking of the "malfunction," CBS said they received a lot of phone calls immediately following the halftime show. Who does that? Do they have CBS' phone number on speed dial? Who says, "I am so offended by seeing a boob on my TV for a couple seconds, that I'm going to quit watching the  Super Bowl , find the contact information to CBS and voice a complaint! Right now!!!"? Do you really even want these people watching your network? I say you don't. * I had to explain to a co-worker who Justin Timberlake is after he appeared on stage. I believe this is the reason *NSYNC made an appearance in my dream last night. I should call CBS to complain about  that!  * My favorite commercial was the Budweiser ad where the donkey wants to be a Clydsedale. I also thouroughly enjoyed the ad with all the football players singing "Tomorrow." Otherwise, I'd say they were sub par. But, I was also watching the game with a lot of chatty Kathies, who were not quiet during commercials. Grrrr.

      Once upon a time, I was going to marry  urlLink Scott.  Our wedding was going to kick ass. I'm fuzzy on all the details, but this is what I remember. We were getting married in KC, then the reception would be held in the Hearnes Center Field House, home of blood drives and J-School graduations. Our guests would take charter busses down lovely I-70 from the wedding to the reception. What would keep them from getting bored on these busses? Mariachi bands on each bus! As for the actual wedding, I believe monkeys, llamas, and Truman the Tiger each had roles. In the reception, we were going to have my neighbor who is an Elvis impersonator sing. Also, we were going to have Clockwork Universe sing us a few tunes -- Jump! -- and, I believe we were going to contact Pearl Jam and see if they were busy. Oh, yeah, the reception was going to be a sleepover, so all the guests were going to need sleeping bags. But, then Scott forgot all about it, so it never happened. If I ever get married, I'm a little afraid planning this extravaganza will leave me disappointed in the real wedding, because it can't hold a candle to this!

I bet I had to print the program for Saturday's game five times. Grrrrr. This, just one day after I almost got in a rumble at the grocery store. Well, not almost, but I thought about it. As the checker was scanning my items -- drugs and juice, hooray! -- I scanned my debit card. As it was processing, I put my card away, and just watched the machine, waiting for it to show my total, so I could press 'OK.' So, I'm just staring at the machine, which reads "please wait," and the girl says, in a very snide and snotty tone, "Swipe your card." What did she think I was doing? Trying to telepathically give my debit card number to the machine? I didn't even have my card out! I was waiting, like the machine politely asked me to do. It really made me angry, and now looking back at it, it wasn't that big of a deal. But, she's so lucky I was under the weather last night.

      I'm pretty sure the reason Lanny got cut was because his mom was firing questions and commands at Meridith left and right. "If he says he needs you, I want you to be there whether you like it or not." "The woman who marries Lanny needs to be submissive. Now, I don't mean submissive like a doormat, but I do mean you have to listen to what he says." "What church do you affiliate with?" "What can I do as your mother-in-law to meet your needs without stepping over the line?" Too much, lady. Too much. Also, I thought it was strange that the brother's wife called the mom Mrs. Lawrence, and not by her first name. Of course, it also probably didn't help when Lanny described in great detail how he breeds his horses.

      KROENKE OUT: Senior guard Josh Kroenke was injured in an accident during practice Sunday and will miss tonight's home game against Colorado and likely Sunday's game against UNLV. Freshman guard Thomas Gardner's dunk shattered the backboard of a basket in Hearnes Center's fourth-floor practice gym, and Gardner pulled the metal rim to the floor as he fell.  The rim hit Kroenke, who was under the basket, on the right leg, creating a cut 1-inch long and 1-inch deep.

      Yeah, you read that right. That's because Bobby  urlLink  returned his salary  last season when he felt the team underacheived. Now, I'm not saying Quin should return his entire salary. He should return half of it, then give the other half to the members of the Mizzou media relations staff that had to deal with his mess. They deserve it.

      My head feels like it's going to explode. It's only by the power of Sudafed that I'm able to function. Good thing I don't get sick. There's one thing I don't get about Sudafed, though. Why not make the pill the size of the dose. These are tiny pills. I shouldn't have to take two tiny pills! Just combine them, and make me only take one medium-sized pill. I don't get this. Tylenol does the same thing. There is no reason to make me take two separate pills! Grrr.

      Missouri needs a point guard. I think they should sign ours. He's averaging 7.3 assists per game, has about a 3-1 assist to turnover ratio, shoots 86% from the free-throw line, 38% from the three-point line and 45% from the floor. Clemons' numbers his soph. year at CSI: 7.4 apg, 81% ft shooting, 40% 3-pt shooting and 45% from the floor. The only big difference is Ricky scored 18.2 ppg, and our guy scores about 9.3 ppg. But, our guy doesn't shoot a billion shots if he's off. And, from what I know, he doesn't beat his girlfriends if they don't want to watch Roots. Sign him! Sign him!

      The following things happened at a  urlLink basketball game in Pennsylvania.  1. Referee makes "bad calls." 2. Mother of a player swears at referee. 3. Mother is thrown out. 4. Husband body slams the referee. To make the story even crazier, school officials, aware that the rivalry between the two schools gets very heated, allowed only parents and grandparents of players to attend the game. The dad is charged with simple assault, assault on a sports official and disorderly conduct. How often does this happen in Pennsylvania that there's an actual "assault on a sports official" charge? Crazy.

      Throughout the season, the kid I keep stats with and I have created several rules of what our players would and would not be allowed to wear if we were coaches. Here's a short list: 1) This one may be the most important. At no time will any of my players wear a hot pink headband. This also applies to any neon color, but hot pink could get you kicked off the team. 2) There are few times when silver shoes are okay. Space exploration is one of them. A basketball game is not. 3) If you are not Michael Jordan, you should not have a tatoo of Michael Jordan. 4) This one is more for the schools than the players who have no control. Maybe before you choose school colors, put them beside each other to see if the combination makes you want to poke out your eyeballs. This especially applies to MCTC, whose school colors are purple and red. Also not good together, red and powder blue. 5) If my team follows these rules, then I as their coach, promise to never wear a turquoise-studded belt buckle the size of my hand.

      I heard a clip on the radio from Missy Elliot defending Janet Jackson, that went along the lines of "We're just people. People expect us to be perfect, but we're not." Thanks for clearing that up, Missy. I know there are a LOT of people out there who previously were walking around thinking pop stars, especially the Jackson family, were perfect. Now they know better.

      When I worked at MLBI, there was an page in the informational packet that they gave out to kids that included the line, "As superstar shortstop Alex Rodriguez says, 'Have fun!  Play Ball!   with Frubes !'" It made me laugh every time I read it, because c'mon, who really believes that at any time in his life A-Rod has uttered the word "Frubes." I don't. But, now I wonder if they'll have to redo the packets, after all, the picture needs to show him in pin stripes, and he's no longer a superstar shortstop. And, I'm not sure you can call him a superstar third baseman before he's played a game in that position. Hmmmm.

      Did anyone else watch the Bachelorette last night? I taped it, and cannot tell you how many times I yelled "White balance!!!" during Meridith and Chad's date. Which drives home a very sad point -- being a broadcast major has not only ruined watching the news for me, but possibly watching reality TV as well. But, really, why can't ABC's photogs white balance. Why did they look like they were hiding in a blue room lit by blue lights as they drank blue drinks? I'm not talking just a little blue, either. And, isn't there more than one camera with them, anyway? Surely the other guy had better video. Man, I wish I had a still of it so you would know what I'm talking about. It was BLUE. At first, because I fast-forwarded through most of the date because I don't like Chad, I thought maybe I missed something and they were somewhere where the light really was blue. So I rewound. Nope. In a hotel room. A  hotel room that probably doesn't make everything in it look blue. Ridiculous. And, even if the light is blue, that's the miracle of white balancing. You make things look normal. And not blue.

I couldn't figure out how to use my temporary key card to open the door, so I just gave up. I thought, "Screw this, I'm getting some ice cream." And, so I went to get a sundae from McDonald's. Except, I passed the entrance to McDonald's. So, no exercise, and no ice cream. Booo.

      I know it's  a day late, but that's because this made-up holiday gave me a day off. And, I was way too busy watching bad TV to make an entry yesterday. Anyway, who's your favorite president? My least favorite is Rutherford B. Hayes, because in fourth grade, misspelling "Rutherford" is the only reason I didn't get a perfect on my test requiring us to name and spell all the presidents in order. Grrr. Who names their kid Rutherford anyway? And then who votes for him? My favorite, and this is based purely on the sheets we got to color while learning the presidents in fourth grade, is probably Calvin Coolidge. He had  urlLink a lot of pets , and his coloring page featured him walking raccoons around the White House lawn. So, maybe he pushed the country towards depression. Who cares! Raccoons!! I also liked Martin Van Buren, whose picture showed him standing on a table in a courtroom. The story is that he was very short, so when he worked as a lawyer he stood on the table so the jury could see him well. He was very excited in the picture. Combine that with his crazy hair and the fact that he was standing on the table, and he looked like a lunatic.

      I learned some fantastic cheers while at two high school girls basketball games last night. My favorite: Steal it! (clap, clap) Steal it! (clap, clap) I also enjoyed: Take it away - from them! Take it away - from them! I kept laughing at these, and the kid I was keeping stats with says, "Haven't you heard that before?" I thought he was joking. I thought, "Has  anyone   heard these before? Aren't they just making them up as they go along? I mean 'Steal it!' must have taken HOURS to create." But, no. He was serious. They actually did break out my old favorite "Let's get fired up! We ARE fired up!" I love that one. I sing it to myself sometimes to help get me through the day.

If it's a repeat of Friends, there's more time before, which would be preferable. Well, not only is it a repeat, but it's not showing on the Fargo NBC affilliate. Neither is any of their other Must See TV programming -- INCLUDING The Apprentice. No, because they're running the Class B Girls State Quarterfinals. Yes. They're cutting away from regular programming, on what I'd venture to say is NBC's most popular night, to show small-town, girls basketball and IT ISN'T EVEN THE FINALS!!!! Who thought of this?!?!?!!?! I mean, it's not like Donald Trump was on the COVER OF NEWSWEEK because of the popularity of this show. Oh, wait. He was. At first I was furious because I couldn't find where they were rerunning it at all, but now I've discovered it will be on Saturday at noon. Which means, I'll have to exercise extreme restraint by not looking to see who was fired before then. The ONE thing I was looking forward to today, isn't happening until Saturday.

      I'm so grouchy today it's not even funny. This is carry over from yesterday. Here is a list of things that went wrong yesterday: 1) It snowed. I was tricked into thinking Spring was on the way. D'oh! 2) Missouri lost. Booo. Quote from Kristi: "Why does Quin think Josh Kroenke is good?" 3) My sixth-graders were obnoxious. Two of my boys came in five minutes late after stopping at the gas station next door to buy cappecinos. That's fine. We had Stations of the Cross last night, so we went to the gym right when the boys got in. As we're sitting on the gym floor, one boy says to me, while practically shaking, "I had too much cappecino!" To which I replied, "What? You only had a little drink before we had to come down here." To which his cohort said, "Well, we had four before we came over! They were only 69 cents! 69 CENTS!!!" So, needless to say, they were more than a little active the rest of the night. 4) I'm an idiot. I had to send out the same release four times before getting it right. Nothing like feeling you're terrible at your job. The volleyball coach left me a message on my cell phone when she caught a mistake, so I went back to the office straight from CCD. There I encountered a coworker who I like, but who drives me crazy because he likes to joke around and give me a hard time, only his jokes are not funny at all. Just annoying. But he thinks they're funny. Never are. I was not in the mood. Now that I've vented, I feel much better.

I'm sitting at my desk, and this player comes into the doorway and points at my Rickey Paulding growth chart. This was the conversation that followed Basketball player: Hey, I like that! Me: Yeah. I hope they win tonight!  BP:What do you know about Missouri? Me: Well, I'm from there, and I went to school there. BP: I'm from Columbia! Well, I live in Minneapolis, but I'm from Columbia. Me: Oh, really! Did you go to Hickman? BP: No. But, my mom did. And my cousin Lance Harris (who now plays at K-State) did. Me: Oh, yeah? Wow. When did you move from Columbia. BP: Oh I was really little. Six or seven... Months. Me: Oh.

This was partly due to a mystery paper jam in the fax machine that just about made me cry. I was very tired. I did not want to argue with the fax machine over whether or not it actually had a paper jam.). But, still, I went home and slept until 11. I should be caught up. I'm not.

      Our men's team won their regional tournament. Now they wait to see who the winner of the Region XXIV tournament is to know their next opponent. The thing is, Region XXIV is made up of  schools in Illinois south of Chicago. (Chicago schools have their own region.) The school that is favored to win is Southeastern Illinois. Just judging by the name, and with my own rough knowledge of directions and Chicago's location in Illinois, I'm pretty sure Southeastern Illinois is NOT in Chicago. But, all weekend the boys kept talking about how they're going to Chicago, bla bla bla. Not being 100% sure that Southeastern Illinois wasn't just a directional misnomer, I never said anything. Also, I wasn't sure that the school didn't have "I tell people I live in Chicago, but actually I live 90 miles away" syndrome. You know the type. Folks, we don't let people from Concordia say they live in Kansas City, and we don't let people from Wentzville claim to be from St. Louis, why do we let these fake Chicagoans get away with this?!?!?! But, anyway, it sure made me angry. I checked on the ever-reliable Mapquest today. Oh, yeah. I was right! They're in  complete   opposite ends of the state. Those boys will be so disappointed.

      That's a direct quote -- minus the profanity, I'm really funny about profanity lately -- from one Lance King, the boy from my high school who is a dead ringer for Eddie Haskell. (At least he was his first senior year in high school.) Anyway, he was in my Spanish I class freshman year, and, as you can tell by the quote, he was very upset that the Spanish word for March included a "Z", when "March" does not. Anyway, I just wrote that as an intro to the "in like a lion, out like a lamb" month. The real reason for this post -- Calendar changing day!!! Just when I thought that Robbie Williams can't get any prettier -- BAM! I flip the page to March and he proves me wrong.

      So, on Saturday night the trainer, assistant men's coach, assistant women's coach and I went to the bar at the Country Kitchen. You read that right. At one point, a bunch of police come in. They're all joking, and one says, "I think you're all underage! Ha, ha, ha..." Then, he comes to me, "But, seriously, I need to see your I.D." Hooray for looking younger than 21!

      Everytime I hear about W condoning a Constitutional ammendment to ban gay marriage, I think of the fake Schoolhouse Rock song that was on The Simpsons. I think you can directly take some of the lyrics, change "flag burning" to "gay marriage" and apply them here:   Amendment: 'Cause there's limits to our liberties, least I hope and pray that there are, 'cause those liberal freaks go too far Boy: Why don't they just make a law against gay marriage? Amendment: Because that law would be unconstitutional. But, if we change the Constitution... Boy: Then we can make all sorts of crazy laws!!!  And then later in the song, a guy in a suit says, "Good news, Amendment! They ratified ya! You're in the US Constitution!" Amendment: Door's open boys! And then a bunch of ther bills start running up the Capitol steps, shooting guns, hooping and hollaring, tossing bombs... typical Republican behavior.

      What's funny about this quote isn't that Jim Harrick, Jr. thought he should be Teacher of the Year for making tests and attendance optional, it's that he also seems to think he's Yoda.  "I thought personally it was a great idea. I took great pride in that class ... Teacher of the Year award, I thought I was going to get," Harrick said."

      I forgot to post about this earlier. The Missouri loss on Sunday followed me everywhere. The team was practicing during the game, so I spent the hour constantly checking with my parents what the score was, etc.  When the practice was over, the assistant coach asked who won. I told him how kansas scored with 2 seconds left to win. One player overheard and said, "Really? Who'd they beat?" When I told him, he said Missouri was weak and that Rickey Paulding was a nobody. I think he was trying to joke around. It was not funny. I made a mental note that he's no longer a candidate for my favorite. Then, on the bus, the student assistant asked who won. Then the head coach asked.  Then, on Monday morning, I passed the head coach in the hallway of the hotel. He was talking to a coach from the area, and he said, "That's our SID. She's a Mizzou alum. She's in mourning today because they lost to kansas." Then, there was a picture of padgett on the front of the complimentary USA Today. Then, we stopped at Steak and Shake for lunch, and this old couple starts talking to some of the players. They guy starts telling our guys about how Illinois barely beat Ohio State. Then, he says, "You know, Missouri got beat yesterday by kansas..." It followed me everywhere.

      On The Apprentice, the folks going into the board room always take their suitcase with them, so it's more dramatic when they get in the taxi and never return to the suite. Well, how on earth do they fit all their clothes in one suitcase?! They have a LOT of business attire, and for women, anyway, that usually also means a lot of shoes. That takes up room. Does NBC give them clothes to wear on the show? I don't believe that they could pack all they needed for the whole show in one bag. The finale on April 15 is LIVE. So, they're there a long time. One bag. Amazing.

      One of my goals in life is to be on a game show. Today, I tried to get closer to making that goal a reality, and I called the Game Show Network's contestant hotline, where you are told about all the contestant searches going on for GSN's gameshows (I want to be on Cram with a friend from high school. I think we'd win.) Anyway, I was not greeted by a friendly gameshow-type voice recording. No. It was the "phone lady" who told me the party at mailbox whatever number was not available, and then told me to leave a message. What! I think the number is wrong on GSN.com, because, c'mon, I don't think they want hundreds of "Hi. This is Kara. I want to be on a game show. I'd be on any game show, but I'd really like to be on Cram. I'm good at remembering things. And I have a lot of practice cramming, as I seldom studied for tests more than a day in advance. Also, I think I'd be ok at Lingo, but for that game, I need a different partner than the partner I'd have for Cram. Whammy? Well, that would be ok, too. But, it's not before Cram or Lingo. Oh, I'd like to be on Funny Money. Put that ahead of Whammy, but after Lingo..." messages. If you promise a hotline, you should deliver a hotline.

      The Italian foreign exchange student who lived up the hill from my family last year once said while on a long drive, "Man! My butt feels like a doughnut! You know, from sitting so long." Well, we didn't know. But, after riding 16 hours on Tuesday night/Wednedsay morning, I still cringed when I sat down in my car this morning (To drive across campus, not just across the parking lot to work.). You'd think I'd be used to it, after sitting in my office for eight hours a day. But, nope. Sixteen hours is still TOO MUCH!

      I can't spell. I don't have a dictionary on my desk. I do have an AP Stylebook. Thus, anytime I don't know how to spell a word, I look it up in the stylebook. The hope is that the word causing me trouble will be listed, and I won't feel like an idiot because that means a lot of people have trouble with that word, not just me. Nine times out of 10, the word I'm looking for isn't listed. Which prompts the mean voice in my head to yell at me, "What did you expect?! It's not a dictionary!"

      First, they lose the rights to SNL. Just because the folks at Fox thought it would be ok to  run Mad TV against SNL does not mean it is a funny replacement. I laugh more at a single viewing of the cowbell sketch or the Falconer than I have at all episodes of Mad TV I have ever seen combined. Now, I go to the dining hall around 1 so I can watch Kids in the Hall. Oops. It's been replaced by Strangers With Candy. C'mon!

      I don't think you should be able to go around spelling names however you want.  It needs to make sense. For instance, it drives me crazy that the interior design guy on Queer Eye spells his name "Thom." Who do you think you are?! It's "Tom"!!! One of the players on the team that beat us last night is named Donta. That's pronounced Don-tay. Ridiculous. And, this isn't really on subject, but how hard is it if you're PAing a national playoff game to learn the pronounciations of the other team's players? We have one kid whose name kept being pronounced worse and worse. And, another thing, maybe learn the name of the school you're playing. We are not North Dakota, nor are we North Dakota State. Also, we are not Wahpeton. I understand North Dakota State College of Science is a mouthful, but at timeouts, you have time. Or, you can say our initials. Or, and this could be crazy, you could call us by our mascot. Is asking for accuracy really too much? Another thing that got me boiling on the trip, a couple Canadians kept insisting that Illinois is in The South. To which I disagreed. "But, it so much warmer here." and "It's south of us..." were their arguments. Yes, well if everything south of and warmer than us was The South, the entire country would be The South. Exept Alaska. I think our trainer summed it up best when he said, "Canadians are strange." Yes. They are. This entire post was just procrastination. It's going to take forever for me to write this...

      Our men's team lost last night. I thought I was going to make it without crying, until I walked into the hallway and saw our point guard, who I want to play at Mizzou. Then, I got a little misty. They played so hard, then lost to the No. 6 team in the country --featuring a player who was an early signee for Louisville, but may go in the first round of the draft instead -- in overtime. When I did sleep on the bus on the way back, my dreams were replays of the game. I'm so sad for those guys. They deserved to go to nationals. But, now I must write the dreaded game summary. Booo. I'm not looking forward to reliving that one.

      But, at least it's over. I wish I had a mind altering machine like in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, because I would have no problem completely erasing this past season out of my memory. Next season I would say, "Hmm... I wonder what ever happened to Rickey and A.J.? They must have left early for the NBA. Surely they wouldn't stick around to underachieve and lead the Tigers all the way to a fifth-place finish in the Big XII and a first-round loss in the Tournament. The National Invitational Tournament. That wouldn't make any sense at all, so it must not have happened."

      On Friday I warned my boss that three losses to ku -- four if you count football -- is more than I can handle in one year, and that if we should lose to kansas, I would likely be pushed over the edge. Well, I'm proud to say I'm as sane today as I ever was, which means I must be getting over the crazy, Missouri-losing-can-put-a-pit-in-my-stomach-for-days mentality that was instilled in me somehow. (Seriously, my parents are fans, but they don't get this worked up. How did this happen?) The Tigers have put me through tremendous stress over the past four months, and now, I feel a little guilty admitting, I'm a little relieved that it's all over.  I thought it would be really depressing if we didn't get in the tournament. But, that was when I believed Missouri would win a game in the tournament. After that half-assed perfomance in a do-or-die situation against our arch rival, I'm pretty certain we'd not only lose, but lose in an embarassing fashion, in the first round. So, not making the tournament just gives me one less week of, "Oh, man! I hope the Tigers win!" then getting punched in the gut. I still couldn't bear to watch the selection show, but I'm moving on! I'm filling out my bracket! And this year, one entire side won't be ruined by my inability to actually write down Missouri losing to someone, thus having them win the tournament every year. I think my biggest disappointment is that my brother and I have to postpone the drink-off we had scheduled for the day between the semifinals and finals back when we thought we were good. So, it looks like we may have to wait to see just who can out-drink who. I think Michael's relieved. He knows.

       Yesterday I took an excursion to Fergus Falls, which is 25 miles away. The main reason -- I needed a good red-toned nail polish for my toe nails. I suppose I could have gone to Pamida. Except, I HATE Pamida. I wanted a Wal-Mart. And that's the closest one. Plus, I could go to Target, as well. Anyway, there were two impulse buys that I was dangerously close to making -- Spice World in the $5.50 DVD bin at Wal-Mart and a lime-green vinyl purse from Target. What  did    I buy that I don't need but I'm still very excited about? Flip-flops with a heel. I LOVE them. I'm a girly girl now. Even girlier than I mistakenly thought Jill was when we first met. Seriously, I never used to get excited about shoes and purses. Yesterday I almost walked out of Target with THREE purses. But, I worked that down to one. Although, before the spring's over, I predict I will also own the other two. I need help.

      But, I love the fact that the NCAA says you can't fly unless your trip is more than 300 miles. It's about 260 miles from Lawrence to St. Louis, so they had to drive, by bus, across Missouri. Bill Self said they were going to stop somewhere to "break bread." I hope they stopped in CoMO, and the person serving them recognized them, and they gave them bad food. I mean food-poisoning bad, not just gross bad. Although, that would be a bonus. But, if it was too gross for them to eat enough of it to catch the food-poisoning (do you 'catch' food poisoning?), then I don't want it to be gross. I want them to get food poisoning and to lose tonight. Is that too much to ask?

      I forgot to post this on Monday. I made up a super-fun new game while on my way home and back last week. It's called "Race at the Pump." How you play: 1. Arrive at the gas pump approximately at the same time as someone else. 2. Race them to fill your tank first. It's great. There are so many unknowns. Maybe they're paying inside. Advantage: Kara. Maybe they have less to fill than me. Advantage: Stranger. Maybe they have a bigger gas tank. Advantage:  Kara. Maybe they don't run around like a crazy person trying to fill their gas tank in record time. Advantage: Kara. The thrill of these unknowns and the pure joy of engaging a stranger in a game in which they don't know they're participating makes Race at the Pump one of the highlights of the drive from CPMO to The Wahp.

But, on the bright side, on today's  urlLink Daily Quickie,  Roy Williams was listed in the no momentum group saying: "kansas or UNC, doesn't matter -- can't win the big game." To quote Nelson, "Ha, ha!"

      My brother and I like to argue over who is the funnier sibling. I hate to admit it, but my sister might actually have us both beat. Here's a sample: Kristi, while reading the alumni magazine article on the $31 million gift to the J-School: 31 million dollars! That's not a gift! Me: What would you call it, then? Kristi: I'd call it "Cha-ching!" Maybe you had to be there, but I almost bust a gut.

      From the KC Star: We have found former Missouri hoopster Albert White.  White is playing basketball these days in South Korea for a team called ET Land Black Samer, which recently was eliminated in the semifinals of the Korean Basketball League.  White did his share in the finale game, though. He pulled off a triple double, scoring 18 points, grabbing 10 rebounds and dishing out 12 assists.

      This really makes me angry, and I should just laugh, but it makes me mad. How on earth does Trump get up in the morning, make his hair look like that, then go out into public. There is NO WAY he can look at himself in the mirror and thinks that looks good. I just don't understand. For someone obsessed with everything associated with him being the best available, why does his hair look like that. Doesn't he know it's hideous? I just CANNOT imagine him going to a mirror and saying, "All right! Lookin' good!" Actually, I can imagine that a little, which might be part of the reason it infuriates me. Donald, you wouldn't be losing if you cut it. It would be ok. I'd like Queer Eye Kyan to get ahold of him. I'd not only watch that, but I'd also tape it and break the tab on the tape.

      A student's coming to his 8 a.m. class in the building where I work. He tried to lock his roommate's 2-day-old SUV, instead hit the Auto-Start, and the car took off in a circle, through the parking lot, over the curb, into the street, back into the parking lot, with the kid chasing it the whole time trying to unlock the car. He was about to get it when it crashed into a pole. What sucks besides wrecking your roommate's car? The fact that when the police got there they found a box from a case of beer in the back (It may have been empty, I don't know.), so even though the kid didn't know it was there, he says, he could also get nailed with an MIP. Not a good way to start the day, I'd say.

John Stewart: Did they say, "Can you change the name Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein?"  Tee hee.

      About two weeks ago, my computer went crazy and began resending old emails. One that was sent was a release on the hiring of our men's assistant basketball coach in August. I didn't want to send an email explaining that this was an old release for four reasons: 1) I didn't know how to explain why it was sent. 2) I didn't want to draw any more attention to it. 3) I blind carbon copy my recipients, so I didn't know exactly who got the email. 4) I thought it would be pretty evident that it was an old email based on the fact that at the top of the page, the very first thing one would read if starting at the top and going left to right, was the date. And it said August 1, 2003. Yet, I was told last night that the Fargo Forum ran an article on this last week. Oops. Oh, well. I'm leaving in nine weeks.

      I LOVE the Hallmark store. I could spend hours there just reading cards. I was very upset a couple weeks ago when I went in search of a specific hilarious card (It features the phrase "I like corn on the cob." I couldn't even type that without giggling. It's great.), and I couldn't find it anywhere. I deduced that it must be sold out because of its extreme hilarity. Well, when I went back yesterday, I still couldn't find it. I was about to get upset. Then, I saw it behind another card, and I bought two. I wasn't going to risk not finding this card again. But, I should suggest that Hallmark expand their fresh ink section so that hilarious cards don't hide behind other cards.

      I keep getting the angriest spam. It cracks me up. Here are some samples: "Enough is enough, Kara!" "I don't believe you, Kara!" "This is wrong, Kara!" Ok, if enough is enough, stop sending me emails! By the way, I think this spammer having my name and email address is a negative externality of the "Send Free Things to Unsuspecting Friends" game. But, having Jill receive an "autographed" picture of Michael Dorn -- Worf on Star Trek -- and think that it contained anthrax was well worth it.

He now has a lake resort in Minnesota, and he told me if I'm ever in the area, I should stop by. This is how he told me to get there. "Well, once you get into Vergas, just stop anywhere. It doesn't matter where, the bank, the grocery store, wherever. Then, ask them where we are. They'll be able to tell you. I could tell you know, but you'd forget."

      One of my favorite marketing campaigns ever. And it's so true. Why do I love them? Because, even when they're down 7-3 in the bottom of the ninth, I stayed at work late so I could watch the end of the game on MLB's Gameday (I gave up on GameCast, then I remembered Gameday is far superior anyway.) Then, what do you know, on one out, they score six runs. Royals Win! Royals Win! I was really nervous about losing that one, especially since I knew Detroit won. I did NOT want to spend a day behind Detroit in the standings. What else do I love? Their shirts with this year's slogan "Together We Can" has the word "O KC tober" on the front. Awesome.

      Some thoughts while I take a break from writing really crummy stories: * I just heard on Virgin Radio that there are rumors (rumours?) circulating around the UK that old Becks has had an affair with his personal assistant. However, Dave has joined Posh, Brooklyn and Romeo on their holiday, and calls the rumors "ludicrous!" * Starting about last Thursday the right side of my jaw hurt when I moved my mouth. First I thought it must have been knocked out of whack somehow. Then, I started worrying that I'd been cut by a rusty nail and didn't realize it and had contracted lock jaw. Then, I really started worrying when I thought that it was actually a tooth hurting, and not my jaw. This was the worst scenario, as I currently have no dental insurance, and no money, so as I told my brother, "I guess I'll just have to guess which tooth it is and pull it. My multi-tool has pliers on it." Saturday it hurt pretty badly, and I couldn't really open my mouth without it hurting. This is bad for someone who likes to both eat and talk a lot. Anyway, today it's all better. Must have just been out of whack, and now it's right. * ROBBIE WILLIAMS IS GOING TO BE IN A MOVIE THIS JUNE!!!!!! I'm very excited about  this, as you can tell by the all-caps and the multiple exclamation points. It's called De-Lovely and it's a musical about Cole Porter. Robbie performs at least one of the musical numbers. Sheryl Crow and Alanis Morriset are also in it.

      As a Royals fan, I fully understand the importance of the bullpen. In the past the boys in blue have blown so many saves that going into the ninth inning I'm nervous no matter what the score is. That point has been driven home (it amazes me how many baseball terms sneak into everyday language. Driven home, the home stretch, cover all the bases, etc.) by the Royals losing their last two games in Chicago's final at-bat. I can't wait until we have our real closer back!!!

So, now "Cougar" is No. 2 on the Top 25 Most Played list. And, it still surprises me every time. And it still makes me laugh a little. PS - Points if you can guess what song is No. 1. PPS - I'm going old school and giving out points like Jill did freshman year.

      I try not to post about things that matter. This is why there's a plethora of posts about reality TV and only a handful about things that are actually important. Anyway, I read  urlLink Andrew's post  and wanted to comment, but I didn't want to take over his comments as my own ranting space. Andrew's completely right. I also find the Republican party to be completely hypocritical. They are anti-social services, preaching personal responsiblity. Yet, look how they've run things. They can't manage money, how can they expect single parents/ the unemployed/ those earning minimum wage to get by? If the current administration was a person, it would have to go on welfare. (And we all know how keen Republicans are on welfare!) Unless, of course, it was in jail serving time for committing fraud. It also amazes me that it's assumed those with strong religious beliefs are Republicans. I mean, doesn't the Bible teach you to help your neighbor? The poor? The sick? Don't these go along more with the Democratic platform? It amazes me that people can look past all these atributes of a political party based on a single issue, abortion.  Anyway, I know I've made sweeping generalizations in this post, and I know that Republicans are good people, too. I mean, my dad's one. But, yeah, Andrew, you're right. That article just makes you sick. Anyway, this post was depressing and not really fun, so here's an old classic joke. Two fish were in a tank. One said to the other, "Hey!

      So, barring any drastic turn of events, in two months I'll be ditching North Dakota for a job in Troy, Ala. Our football coach was an assitant with the now A.D. at Troy State, so he put in a good word for me and I was able to get a job as a graduate assitant in their media relations department. It should be a good deal. Originally I was supposed to start on June 1, and since I'm not supposed to finish here until June 21 and I have not finished my time machine (yet), I was really stressed about this. But, it looks like I'll be able to start with the second summer session that starts on July 6, so it should all work out. One thing I'm already dreading -- the Tigers roll into Troy on Sept. 11 (or Sept. 9 if they're able to get the ESPN Thurs. night game). I don't know if I can handle this. One good thing, Troy's men's basketball team beat Belmont not once, but twice.

      When I first read the headline  urlLink Heavy Social Drinkers Suffer Brain Damage  I was a little worried. I mean, what's the definition of heavy? More than 0-4? Well, thankfully, "heavy" is defined as more than 100 drinks in a month. Which to me means alcoholic, not "heavy social drinker." They did say the results could be the effect of alcohol withdrawl, as the participants had not had a drink for 12 hours! Anyway, at the end of the article, they suggested moderate drinking, which means one drink a day for women. Since I have no social life in ND, I've got a LOT of drinks built up, so WATCH OUT!

      A few things: 1) I hate Trish. Wow. It doesn't matter how many times you say you're fabulous. There's already been Tina Fabulous on The Bachelor, they're not going to nickname you Trish Fabulous. Just stop. Also, your hair was not long enough to go in that ponytail at the rose ceremony. You should have been cut just for that. 2) Maybe if you're trying to convince the 15 girls you're dating at the same time that you're the guy for them, you shouldn't tell them the reason you want to get married is because you're tired of sleeping with random girls. There has to be a better way to put that... 3) Not a fan of Julie, the cheerleader. She actually did a cheerleading move when he gave her the last rose. WTF? I wish Jesse would have said, "I'm sorry, I got the name wrong again. I meant ... anyone else. That is strange and creepy. Please go away."

I'm more free to buy her a birthday present now that Saddam Hussein is not in power. Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention, bonus points if your answer includes, "Saddam Hussein is dangerous."

      *I had a good Easter. The best part -- now I can drink pop again, and I'm doing it like it's my job. Usually when I give up pop and have been drinking water for 40 days, I reach the, "Pop really doesn't sound appealing. All that syrup and sugar, blech!" stage. Not this year! Bring it on!!! *Wally Cleaver was a central character in my dream Sunday night. It was awesome. I then decided that if I could be any sit-com character, I'd be Mary Ellen Rogers. *I was offered a job yesterday. It's almost more stressful to think of finishing this job, moving 1500 miles, and starting a new job -- and classes! -- in six weeks than to think of being unemployed in six weeks. I'm still tinkering with the timing, so hopefully it won't be so rushed. We'll see. More details on this later. *My priorities are clearly where they should be. Most people would list a potential job below a dream about the Cleaver clan. *I woke up at 4 a.m. and did not go back to sleep until about 6 a.m. It sucked. I was too worried about things. I don't count sheep, but I do try things like naming the presidents in order and naming the state capitals. This did not make things any better when I realized I do not know the capital of New Hampshire, and began worrying about why I don't know the state capital of New Hampshire. Then I realized I don't know any cities in N.H. Rough night, I tell you. *I laughed out loud when I read  urlLink this  on Sunday. Then I had to explain to my mom what a metrosexual is. *God bless CNBC. Last night, I got to watch the episode of The Apprentice that I had missed on Thursday. Hooray.  *From now on, I'm going to try to write shorter entries. This is TOO MUCH!

      First, I'm still appalled by how Jill tells me the boys who are at UVA Law dress, especially the ones who went to an Ivy League school for undergrad. I think it's the "Our school has the ranking of an Ivy League school, so let's dress like it!" mentality. Three polo shirts? At one time? Never necessary. Anyway, now I've read this article about Princeton's  urlLink Drinking Day  and it makes me wonder two things. 1) Why didn't Mizzou have a drinking day? and 2) What is an eating club? I know Jill and I tried to start the Eat and Take a Nap Club, but it never really took off. Are these similar? Eating clubs are the social hub of the university? What?

      In my first week participating in the Rose Cermony game on abc.com, I correctly predicted all six of the rose recipients on last night's episode of The Bachelor. I had to laugh when Jesse and Suzie were at the silent movie, which was actually pictures of the two of them (I believe Andrew Firestone and Kirsten had a similar date. And, there's a movie about a girl dating about five guys where one of thim pulls a similar stunt.) Anyway, they show the token naked baby photo, Suzie says, "I can't believe they showed the naked baby photo!" And Jesse, trying to sound smooth as he made his move says, "I liked it..." Ummm... that's a little creepy. Yes, it was a picture of Suzie naked. But, she was a BABY. Don't act like that turned you on! Trish is joining Steve Lavin on the list of people who if I see them, I will do them physical harm.

      3) March 18, 2004 -- Britt and I met some random boys and one girl from the Air Force in KC and hung out with them until 7 a.m. And, Britt danced with an old Mexican WWII veteran. And we both lost in drinking races. And we hid behind bushes while these men who protect our country tried to devise a way to sneak us into their hotel after the bars closed. Unsuccessful in that attempt, by the way. 2) New Year's Eve 1999 -- I ended up at my friend's uncle's house, dodging fireworks as they were inadvertantly shot at us. If you ever asked me prior to that night where I would be as the world moved into 2000, I would NEVER have said there. 1) Last night. I was planning on watching AI and maybe the Real World. I also had to do some planning for tonight's CCD class. Anyway, at 5:45 I got a call from the volleyball coach, Jane.  Jane: Do you want to go to the casino tonight? Me: Sure... Jane: Ok. Can I stay at your house? Me: I guess... I'll have to clean like a maniac... So, at 8, after 2+ hours of hard-core cleaning we went to the casino that's right on the N.D./S.D state line.  We played the roulette wheel, and not to brag, we were pretty good at it. We only put in combined $10 at a time, and one round we cashed in $83. We were the obnoxious ones who get excited when they win $3. There were high-fives aplenty. When it was all said and done, I left with ten bucks more than I came with. Of course we didn't leave until this morning, as we could not drive back last night and stayed in the hotel there. As the night wore on, I kept saying, "It's Tuesday night... and I'm at the casino..." Yeah, it's hands down the most random night of my life.

      Our football coach, who basically got me my job at Troy State, is very excited that I'm going there. For a couple days, every time he saw me, he sang the fight song. I thought, "That song is strangely familiar, since I have no reason to know the Troy State fight song." Well, that's because it was actually the Notre Dame fight song. So, finally I said, "Isn't that the Notre Dame fight song?" He said, "Yeah, but I don't remember Troy's. But, they do have a good band." And now, he still sings Notre Dame. Hooray!

      Last night I went out to eat with our volleyball coach and a volleyball coach from MSU-Moorhead. The MSUM coach, who I'd never met before, said to me, "I bet you're kind of a flower child inside." I told her that I used to think I would have been a hippie if I were around for that era. But, after seeing high-school aged war protesters in CoMO, I decided I'd be more likely to run over a hippie than be one. It was a sad realization. (Speaking of volleyball, I think it edges out soccer as the sport that's grown on me the most since high school. I used to HATE it! Hate, hate, hate it.) Then the coaches who know me said I've changed. I informed them that, no, it's just that I have a slow-to-warm personality. People here don't seem to understand the slow-to-warm personality. You'd think living in North Dakota, they'd have a solid grasp on the slow-to-warm concept.

Anyway, here are the first points awarded...  urlLink Jill  - This morning as I drank my Diet Dr Pepper, I thought, "Man! This is SOOO good!" So, Jill gets 1 point for introducing me to this wonderful concoction.  urlLink  Dan  gets 1 point for entering my suggestion in Big 12's Rename-Our-Bar contest and offering to split the beer tab if he wins. Hooray! Kevin Appier gets -5 points for his inability to pitch more than three innings on Saturday.

      1) The Royals losing 6 in a row. 2) The Royals getting swept by the Twins. This is especially painful living in "Twins Country" and because I had the joy of witnessing one of the losses first-hand. 3) Kevin Appier starting a game in 2004, when the JumboTron "Remember When" features the Twins beating Kansas City in 1991 in another game started by Kevin Appier. I don't know exactly how old Kevin Appier is, but I'm guessing his age plus the top speed of his fastball would hit around 175. And he only threw about 80 on Saturday.

      Umm... call me crazy, but I get very frustrated when our "closer" gives up two home runs and a triple in the ninth. That shouldn't cut it. He blew his third straight save. So, why is he pitching in the ninth? Isn't MacDougal back? I don't get it. On the bright side, Carlos Beltran hit his eighth home run of the year, putting him on pace to hit 64+. (I love extrapolating early-season stats to the whole season. They're so ridiculous and useless. And fun.) However, if things keep going this way, he'll hit at least half of those for another team. Booo.

      I have absolutely NOTHING interesting to say. At least, nothing that warrants its own post. So, here are a few snippets, that on a better day I might be able to accompany with some type of opinion or commentary to create individual posts. But, today, I don't. * I'm going to have to start voting in AI. I always mean to, but never have. Anyway, once this thing is over, I'm so buying George Huff's CD. And, that CD will be the one in my collection that people look at and say, "Hmmm. Didn't expect you to have that one." We all have them. Right now I'd say my CD that fits that description is Warren G. However, I haven't listened to that since junior high, so it doesn't really count. Also, I don't like it. But, I do like George Huff. He sure likes to bounce. * The longer Jesse keeps Trish, the less I like him. I also like how he was more bothered by random bachelorette telling him that Trish is trouble than he was when his best friend. I wonder how he feels about Eli Manning joing the team, on an unrelated note. * Yesterday the governor came to campus. He patted me on the back. But, he did not say he was proud of me, so that tally stands at one. * We had a professional photographer on campus yesterday to take pictures of the governor's forum. Then, we scheduled other photos for the rest of the day so we only had to bring him on campus the one time. Anyway, it was my job to recruit students to be in the photos of fake classes and the "I'm happy and walking oustide!" photos that you see in every college viewbook in America. Since the only students I know are athletes, one group in the "happy outside" pictures contained three boys 6-7 and taller. A true representation of our campus. *Yesterday was nice out, so I decided it would be a good day to break in the kitten-heeled flip-flops that I bought about a month ago. That was a bad idea. I forget that most days the only walking I do in my work clothes is the 150 steps (I actually counted once.) from my building to my office door. Yesterday, I walked much more. And, a lot of times my heels sank into the ground. Poor shoe selection, Kara! * I'm very excited about the photo we took for the schedule poster. * Perhaps my favorite part of Ben Kweller's new CD is the opening to the song "On My Way." It includes the line "I'd kill him with karate." Awesome. * At first, I did not like the show Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Then, I realized that talking milkshakes, fries and meatwads are funny. If you have not yet reached this realization and have nothing to do on Sun.-Thurs. at 11 p.m. (CDT), turn on Cartoon Network. You'll be glad you did. Probably. * The other day on the TV Guide Channel, I saw a clip of Jessica Simpson singing Robbie Williams' song "Angels." I'm not sure how  I feel about that. I REALLY like that song. I don't really care for Jessica. But, maybe people would hear that song and say, "Hey, that's a great song. I bet it'd be AMAZING if a beautiful, talented British boy sang it." Then, they might discover Robbie. And, that is something I whole-heartedly support. * For a post about nothing, this turned out to be kind of long. Sorry, dudes.

      The Mizzou women's golf team finished 6th in the Big XII Tournament. This is disappointing for a group hoping to win the thing, but better than No. 8 kansas! Which means add three to the point total! Which means we're just down 16.5-15.5 now! I'm  a little nervous about the men's golf team.

      Watch Out! Here Comes Kara! presents Goofus and Gallant. Gallant knows that to be a healthy young man, he must exercise regularly. Goofus drives by the gym, decides it looks too busy, then goes to Dairy Queen instead. Gallant: "Oh, my! Is that the fire alarm? I need to get out of the building right now!" Goofus hears the fire alarm, but decides since he can't smell smoke, it's probably not real. So, he continues ironing his pants, puts in a tape to tape the  Friends  finale, changes clothes, then leaves. Yesterday, I was Goofus. But, in my defense, it was a false alarm. I asked a coworker who's a volunteer firefighter, and he said they weren't even called out to the building.

      First, I had to laugh as I googled "Kansas Department of Tourism." I bet  that's  a page that gets a lot of hits. But, the funniest part came when I was told by an operator, "Let me transfer you to our cartography department." Kansas has a cartography  department ?! The state is a rectangle! How many people do they need drawing maps of it? Does the geography of kansas really change that much? I'm amazed by this. Also, the guy I talked to said none of the department of transportation maps are copyrighted, so I could copy them as much as I want. He then said, "Your tax dollars at work. Ha ha ha." Ha! Joke's on you, mister!  I  don't pay taxes in kansas! So, thanks, Kristin, for paying taxes in kansas so that I can copy this map.

      Of course, I'd wish for a million more wishes. Then, I'd use one of those to ask that the Royals have the ability to win two -- or more! -- games in a row. Actually, I'd ask for a bazillion dollars and buy the Royals. And I'd dish out the dough to make the team competative. And people all across America would hate me as much as they do George Steinbrenner, but I wouldn't care, because I'd have a World Series ring for each finger... This post got of track. The point: I wish the Royals would win more often.

      On Monday, Curtis Leskanic is sent home to check on his shoulder. He is NOT with the team in Toronto. The Royals go on to win a close game in Toronto. Hmmm. Perhaps it was because Leskanic wasn't there to give up 5 runs in 2/3 of an inning like he did on Saturday!!! Of course, I can see where it would be tempting to use him, given he has a flashy 14.73 ERA.

      I'm an idiot. I assumed that Men's and Women's track teams each got 3 total points. Sadly, as  urlLink Rob  pointed out, they only get one. What a rip off! Oh, well. Once our baseball teams sweep their baseball team (and if we can take two-of-three from No.1 Texas, we can beat crap-a-riffic kansas), it will be a moot point. Then, we just don't need any post-season tournament shenanigans. I don't think I could handle being up by 1 point, then losing because the golf team lost in the national tournament, or something ridiculous like that. Boy, if I ran track I'd be mighty pissed that our sport is only worth one point.

Well, then imagine how happy I was when I saw that while we placed 11th, ku came in 12th! We now lead 21.5-19.5 with just three baseball games left. If we win just one of those, we take it! (Barring any meetings in any national tournaments or the Big 12 baseball tournament...) I'm so giddy!

      Last night when I got to the gym the TV in front of the machine I was going to use was turned off. I'm not tall enough to reach it without using a magazine (this is how I turned it on Saturday, when I was the only person in the building.), and I couldn't find the remote. I did not want to employ the magazine method last night, though, because there were four men there, including my mulletted friend. So, I just got on the machine closest to the middle TV so that I could watch it. 40 minutes is just too long to just run... Anyway, about 12 minutes in, I see the remote on the machine next to me. I just kept staring at it, but I knew there was no way my short arms were going to reach it. So, I just watched the middle tv.  Interesting side note: I felt very old last night. The radio station they were playing there was having "Retro Night," playing songs from the 80s and early 90s. I think that was the first time I've heard music that was cool when I was in junior high make the "Retro Night" playlist. Side note 2: This one isn't really interesting, but anyway... for some reason, running makes me want to sing along to the radio much like in the car. When "500 Miles" came on, it was all I could do not to start belting it out. On the one hand, I think it would be HILARIOUS to see the reactions of the others there, but, maybe I'll wait until I'm closer to moving. Or until I'm the only one in the building again.

      Working on the Housing and Dining brochure makes me thing two things. 1) I'm hungry. 2) I don't have a place to live when I move. I should really get on that. I'd work on it over my lunch hour, but if you'll refer to thought number 1, you'll see why that isn't likely.

      Today at lunch a coworker asked if I've been to every MLB stadium in America. I told her, no, but attending a game at every MLB park is on my list of things to do before I die. (By the way, I haven't made much of a dent with a whopping three on the list thus far.) Then I realized the only other thing on my list is to be on a gameshow. And that's it! Surely I can accomplish more than that. I need more random life goals! Not career goals, just random things I want to do before I die. Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

      Now that the Royals have won two in row, I'm unrealistically optimistic about our chances.  Anyway, last year the Twins won 90 games to win the division. There are 130 games left. The Royals just need to go 79-51 (.607) to reach that number. The 16 games left in May are: 3 at home vs. Oakland, 3 at Texas, 3 at Oakland, 3 at home vs. Detroit, 3 at home vs. Minnesota and one at Detroit. If we can take 2-of-3 from Oakland at home, go 3-3 on the road trip, get really hot and take 5-of-6 from the divisional foes in that homestand, then win at Detroit, we'll go 11-5 over the rest of the month and stand at 22-26 overall. Then in June we stay in Detroit for 3 more games, which means after we win those, we'll be 25-26 going into a home series with Boston. It could happen! Together we can! O KC tober!!

      The Missouri men's basketball coaching staff gets -1000 points. I think we all know why. Nate Field gets a point for closing the game yesterday, giving the Royals TWO WINS IN A ROW!!! J-Dub and Jill get points for successfully finishing a year of law school. Andrew gets a point for graduating. He does not, however, get a point for predicting that I would not vote for George Huff. I don't look at that as a correct prediction, but rather as mocking me. And as the saying goes, you don't mock that hand that gives out the points. Also, the Dairy Queen in Breckenridge gets 100 points for the All-Syrup Misty.

      Why am I annoyed at Syracuse changing its name to Orange, rather than the Orangemen/women? It has NO effect on me at all. And, I don't think you can just  say  you're the only school with orange as a primary color. There are few schools - Illinois, Texas, Tennessee, OSU -- who suit up in hideous orange uniforms who might disagree. I guess it depends on how you define "primary color." I'd consider Mizzou's primary colors to be black and gold. So, wouldn't OSU's primary colors be orange and black? What about Miami's vomit-inducing color combination of orange and green? Doesn't that make orange one of their primary colors? Why does this annoy me so much?!

      Perhaps this is a sign that I'm really, really lame. But, here are the highlights of my weekend: 1) Purchasing and reading a good chunk of  Eats, Shoots and Leaves.  I use commas like a stupid person (I blame being a broadcast major), and now that I'm no longer in a field where punctuation usually doesn't matter I want to change that. We'll see how successful I am. Then I'll take on the task of correcting my horrible spelling and grammar. 2) Going to Dairy Queen, and leaving with an ALL-SRYUP MISTY!!! This gould possibly go on the list of the top-ten coolest things ever to happen to me. "Delicious, sugary goodness" does not even begin to describe the party that was in my mouth. You know how usually you finish with a cup full of half-syrupy ice. I had less than a half-inch of ice. It was great.

Side note about the PBR bar -- I was there watching my friends' band perform. The band that played after them was made of ROBOTS. I kid you not.

And, I did kind of suspect that it would be a commercial since they have a series of them on the web featuring Seinfeld and Superman. But, c'mon.

      Dennis Hastert is an idiot, in my humble opinion. Hastert, who was rejected for military service, felt it was his place to lecture McCain, who spent five years as a POW, about  urlLink war-time sacrifices.   I love this quote from Sen. McCain: "The speaker is correct in that nothing we are called upon to do comes close to matching the heroism of our troops," he said. "All we're called upon to do is not spend our nation into bankruptcy while our soldiers risk their lives. I fondly remember a time when real Republicans stood for fiscal responsibility."  Seriously, if we have to have a Republican in the White House, why couldn't it be McCain?

      Recently I posted that I have too few life goals. Well, I've been inspired lately, and now I have a list of goals that I want to accomplish before the end of 2006. 1) Run a half marathon. I got an email from a friend yesterday who's training for the NYC Marathon. I don't think I'm going to go that far, but I looked up some training programs, and unbeknownst to me, I'm already well into the "building a base" phase of a training program for a marathon, and mostly finished with one for a half marathon. So, surely with a little dedication I can work up to 13.1 miles, right? 2) Get my master's degree. If this one doesn't happen, I'm in trouble. 3) Purchase a  urlLink smart car.  I LOVE these things. And, I'd feel like I was helping the environment. The only catch is, I don't want the SUV version. I'd just want a  urlLink forfour.  So, if that isn't available in the US in 2006, I get a grace period.  4) Attend an international sporting event. This one hinges on the launch of the Baseball World Cup (which I hope is renamed for numerous reasons.) in 2005. Since it would be hosted here initially, I should be able to afford that. But, if that doesn't happen, maybe I'll just swing by Germany for the 2006 World Cup. And if all else fails, I'm going to a Royals/Blue Jays game.

Well, not so much a blister as a chunk of skin ripped off my finger all of a sudden. It didn't gradually build up, like a blister. Either way, it sucks. * In the last episode of The Brak Show and in the bumps surrounding it, they make many references to the show being cancelled. So, how happy was I when I saw Brak on my TV last night telling me that his show is back on! I think it was all a dirty trick and that the show was never cancelled in the first place, but now I don't have to worry about it! Hooray!

      I forgot to give Britt a point for answering her phone. Don't worry, she reminded me. Also, I gave Jill a point for her birthday. Andrew and Dan get graduation points. But, then Andrew gets -5 points for his anti-Royal rant. He thinks that's not much, but I'd like him to keep in mind that -5 is the same number of points I gave Kevin Appier for blowing games all the time. So, -5 is no laughing matter, buddy. Also,  urlLink J Dub  reminded me how terrible our graduation speaker was. So, -5 points for that guy, and a point for J Dub for brining up a funny memory. And, Kristin gets a point because she reminded me to give negative points to Andrew, and because I've been neglecting her pointwise. Um, I really need a hobby.

      I don't have anything of value to say today. Not that I usually do, but today I have even less. That is, I  had  even less, until  urlLink Andrew went and shot his mouth off about how crappy the Royals are.  Listen, pal, I don't need anyone to tell me we have not met preseason expectations. But, now my feathers are ruffled, and I felt obligated to dig up  urlLink this old column by Joe Posnanski  of the KC Star. In the first paragraph he admits that St. Louis fans are the best in baseball, so I think you'll enjoy it, Andrew. Grrrrrrrrrrrrr.

      Last night's episode of The Simpsons was one of the best ever, and certainly one of the most political. The family was arrested in violation of The Governement Knows Best Act after Bart accidentally mooned the flag. Then, while in a "re-education center," they watched an aninmated video to help set them straight. Here's my favorite line: Constitution: "Hi! I'm the US Constitution. I'm over 200 years old, but I'm still feeling fine! Not like my crazy cousin, the Bill of Rights..." (Bill of Rights takes a swig from a bottle, then vomits amendments.)

      I watch children's programming on Saturday mornings. Imagine my horror when the students in "That's So Raven" appeared on my TV wearing green and yellow sweatshirts that read "Bayside High School Barracudas". WHAT!? First, if Bayside's colors were actually green and yellow, Kelly Kapowski never would have been named homecoming queen after her face was colored maroon from Screech's zit cream. Their colors are maroon and white! And, secondly, their mascot is the Tigers. I can't believe they're getting away with this! Especially since "That's So Raven" is on ABC. Are the people at NBC aware of this, because I'd think that they'd take action if they knew the blasphemy taking place at the alphabet network.

      When I lived in Room 24 of the ZTA house, we had a complaint box. We thought this was too negative, and added the "Whoo hoo!" box, which had the above title written on it. This was because we had a rule that if you wrote a complaint, you had to also write something that made you happy. Good times. Anyway, I felt like a negative Nellie by writing my 10 worst sports moments, so I felt I should write a list of my 10 best sports moments, again based on being a Mizzou/KC fan. This list was MUCH harder to write than the other, by the way.  10. MU beats kU 81-59 in 2000. This was the first time I was present for an MU-kU basketball game. It was never close. Roy cried. What's not to love? 9. Mizzou advances to the 2002 Elite Eight as a 12-seed. I think we were the last team in. We got the best draw, as we creamed Miami, Ohio State and fought back to beat UCLA. It was a good time to be a Tiger. 8. Eric Piakowski's three rims out, Mizzou beats Nebraska 80-78 to finish 14-0 in the Big 8. This is the reason I say conference finish is as important as NCAA Tournament play. If you say "1994" to a Mizzou fan, nine times out of ten the reply will be "14-0." That team also went to the Elite Eight. This is why finishing 5/6 in the Big XII for five years is NOT acceptable, even if you happened to go to the Elite Eight one of those years. 7. The 1997 Mizzou team goes to the Big XII Tournament finals as the 10-seed in the tournament. I LOVED the 1996-97 team. They might be my favorite of all time, despite the fact that they finished 18-19. Buck Grimm, Kelly Thames, Corey Tate and of course Jason Sutherland all hold a special place in my heart. L. Dee Murdock (who we called Lenny because that "L."  had  to stand for something! It didn't.) came out of nowhere to be a maniac in the tournament. Norm came to the tournament with just one suit, because he thought they'd lose to Nebraska in the first round. They didn't. He had to buy two new suits while in Kansas City. This tournament also produced one of my favorite post-game quotes. After they beat Oklahoma, a reporter asked Jason when was the last time he played in a game that important. His answer was perfect: "Uh... yesterday." There's more on the 1997 team later... 6. The 2003 Royals remind me why I love them. First they start the season 9-0, and they finish better than .500 for the first time since 1994. I Believed. 5. The 1985 Royals win the World Series. This would be higher, except that I was four. This is what I actually remember about the 1985 World Series: My family was cheering for the Royals. My neighbor/best friend's family was cheering for the Cardinals. Once she and her brother told me that the Cardinals were going to win, and that if the Royals and Cardinals ever got into a fight the Cardinals would win because they had football players, too. I was so confused about how the Cardinals could have both and we didn't. Again, I was four. This is what I know about the 1985 World Series. As soon as you say anything about it to a Cardinals fan they start crying "Don Denkinger! Wah! Wah! Wah!" Well, here's why that logic fails. That play would have been the first out of the ninth. So, say he's called out. One out, nobody on. Balboni follows with a base hit. One out, man on first. Ok, in real life, Orta is thrown out at third following a sac bunt attmept by Sundberg. Ok, so in "St. Louis scenario," the Royals aren't going to bunt with just a man on first. So, even assuming Sundberg gets out, that's two outs, man on first. The runners advanced with the passed ball. So, two outs, man on second. Hal McRae walks. Two outs, man on first and second. Iorg singles to right. In real life, two runs score and the game ends. In "St. Louis scenario" one run would score, and there would be men on first and second with the score tied at one. Some Cardinals fans act like the blown call was with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. That's just not the case. Don't let them fool you! 4. The 1993 Chiefs advance to the AFC Championship games with close wins at Pittsburgh and Houston. After winning 27-24 in OT against the Steelers, the Chiefs come back to beat the Oilers 28-20. It was fun. 3. George Brett gets his 3,000th hit. I love George Brett. If I ever have a son, there's even odds that he'll be named Brett. 2. MU beats No. 1, 22-0 kU 96-94 in 2OT in 1997. As long as I live, I will never forget Mike Kelly's screams of "Corey Tate! Corey Tate!" when he made that jumper at the buzzer. kU started Paul Pierce, BJ Williams, Raef LaFrentz, Jared Haase and Jauque Vaughn. We started Kelly Thames, Corey Tate, Buck Grimm, Dibi Ray and Danny Allouche. Who? Exactly. There were so many kU fans at my high school, that the other Mizzou fans and I wrote thank-you cards for the team to thank them for beating kansas and making the next day the best day at school EVER. That was the only regular season game kansas lost. At the game in Lawrence, the very clever students started chanting "NIT." Norm, who actually WAS clever, replied, "Hell, we'll have to win a few more games to even get to the NIT!" I love Norm. Oh, and did I mention that after the game, Roy cried? Because he did.  1. Missouri 41, Nebraska 24. Sometimes I still think it was all a dream.  Honorable mentions: MU beats Iowa State in 4OT. This would be higher, except that Clarence Gilbert is an idiot, and if he had better clock management, the game never would have gone on that long. Still, it was nice for Mizzou to be involved in an ESPN Instant Classic in a game we WON! The Royals win 14 consecutive games in 1994. Whooo! Pre-strike baseball! Corby Jones, Devin West and Brock Olivo bring Mizzou back to a bowl game in 1997. Mizzou beats Marc Bulger's West Virginia team in the 1998 Insight.com bowl. Hooray.

      I went to lunch with a coworker today at the Godfather's Lunch Buffet. There was a lady eating by herself at the table next to us. When she left, my coworker said, "She ate a lot. Look how many plates she had!" She did have about six or seven plates. I replied, "Maybe she just doesn't like her food to touch." She looked at me like I'm crazy. I told her that I don't really like my food to touch, and she said she's never heard of it before. That's crazy talk! Correlle makes partition plates for grown-ups! Lots of people don't like their food to touch. It's NOT unusual! Well, maybe it's unusual, but it's not uncommon! Who's with me on this one?

      * There are few things on TV funnier than when Conan pulls the "Walker, Texas Ranger" lever to show a clip from Walker. What a dumb show! Why did people watch this? Here's my favorite clip: A lady and Walker and walking around outside. Lady: "The cops I know don't take their work so personally." Walker: "You don't know the right cops." Then, he lies down on the ground, and starts smelling the dirt. Then, he picks up some dirt, stands up and tastes the dirt. Walker: "There was a plane crash here." WHAT?!?!?!?! * I watched bits and pieces of the AI final last night. It just reminded me that I love George Huff. * I'm glad that Colin Quin's show is back on with new episodes. I was not glad when one of those episodes featured hosts from Air America. They were very angry and not very funny. Especially Janeane Garofalo. I don't think it's a good idea to have four comedians who are all going to agree on everything, and are so staunch in their position that they won't even listen to Colin. You have to listen to Colin! It's his show!  * I'm also glad Cartoon Network is showing Aqua Teen Hunger Force Sun. through Thurs. What I'm not glad about is that they show the same episodes all the time! Diversify!

      The Today show's been in town to do a piece on how "cool" Fargo is. But, their visit isn't the one convincing me of Fargo's coolness. No, it's the fact that VANILLA ICE is coming in June! Of course, it's the day I'm moving, and I don't think the folks want to take a trip up to Fargo to see Vanilla Ice.

      The blip about KC being a sports-tortured city made me come up with my own list of my ten worst sports moments, related to KC and Mizzou. 10. The Fifth Down. This would have been higher, but I was nine at the time. However, the glorious creation that is ESPN Classic allowed me to watch this debacle, and it still hurt. 9. The 13-3 Chiefs lose to Denver 14-10 in the AFC Divisional playoff game in 1997. I hate John Elway. 8. MU is trailing No. 20 Michigan State 13-10 inside 2 minutes with the ball near mid-field. Larry Smith decides to punt. I hate Larry Smith. 7. OU's Jameel Heywood tips in a shot at the buzzer to beat Mizzou 63-61 in 2002. I hate Oklahoma.    6. Jermaine Dye is traded for Neifi Perez. Straight up. And people weren't fired for this. 5. The 2003-04 Missouri men's basketball season. This isn't really a "moment." Because it NEVER HAPPENED. 4. To avoid a shot-clock violation, Aaron Miles throws up the ugliest shot this side of third-grade-girls' basketball and ties the game at 74 with 1:20 left in the MU-kU game in 2003 -- my final game as a Mizzou student. Kirk Hinrich makes a similar buzzer-beating shot moments later to break the tie, and kU goes on to win 79-75. This win keeps Missouri from finishing undefeated at Hearnes that season. 3. With the Royals on fire, MLB players go on strike in 1994. We haven't been competitive since. 2. Lin Elliot misses two field-goal attempts inside of 40 yards as the 13-3 Chiefs lose to Indianapolis 13-10 in the AFC Divisional playoff game. 1. Three words: Four. Point. Eight. This game bothered me so much that the following fall I cheered FOR kU when they played UCLA.  Also receiving votes: *"The Kick." This would have made the top 10, if I hadn't also been a Nebraska fan at the time. * Clarence Gilbert can't hit a shot to save his life, a nobody can hit a free throw, as Missouri loses to OU in the Elite Eight. * The 2002 Royals season. * Mizzou loses by 55. To K-State. In basketball. * The 9-6 Chiefs fall to Oakland 38-35 in overtime at Arrowhead in the regular season finale in Jan. 2000. KC takes a 17-0 lead in the first quarter, but can't hold on. John Baker kicks off out-of-bounds twice, leading to the game-tying and game-winning field goals for Oakland.

      ESPN2's Cold Pizza has been running down the top-15 most tortured sports cities in America. They put KC at No. 14. Simmons says we should be higher.   14. Kansas City K.C. hasn't appeared in a championship final in any sport since 1985. It doesn't have an NBA team or an NHL team. It has a small-market baseball team that has no chance of competing with the Yanks and Sox on a year-to-year basis. Maybe the Chiefs have been consistently solid, but you won't see NFL Films releasing a "Greatest Chiefs Playoff Moments" DVD any time soon. They also have an inferiority complex about St. Louis, which speaks for itself. This place is a mess. The only good thing they have going for them is Joe Posnanski, and even he's ready to hang himself at this point. They should have cracked the top 10.  I think those in KC who are on the good side of the MU/kU rivalry have it even worse. As far as the inferiority complex when it comes to St. Louis, I'll admit, I was VERY angry when St. Louis won the Super Bowl in 2000. They got the Rams, what in 1995? And they're in the Super Bowl?! Chiefs fans deserved it more.

      It's only been baseball season for seven weeks. The Royals are on pace to lose 111 games. And, by the end of the month, I'll not only be surprised if Beltran is still a Royal, but it looks like  urlLink Joe Randa might be on the way out, too.  I don't think I could handle seeing Joe Randa play for another team. Darn those Royals for giving me such high expectations!

      This weekend I watched a movie called "Life Without Dick." I cannot believe I had never heard of it. Not only did it star Harry Connick, Jr. as an aspiring Irish singer, it also featured Johnny Knoxville! AND Bing Crosby's "Pistol Packin' Mama" was on the soundtrack! And the lead actress was Sarah Jessica Parker. Anyway, I liked it.

      Ok, so quite a while ago I won tickets to the Broadway shows that would be shown at the Fargodome. One of the shows was Lord of the Dance. For some reason, this made me very angry. I've since decided that having the option of going to a show for free shouldn't make me angry. Anyway, I went last night. But, I did not get a playbill, so I really was confused. Here's what I got out of it: First, these people came on stage in hoods and with torches. Scary. There were bodies on the ground. Well, people pretending -- acting! -- to be bodies. Anyway, this girl in this  hideous silver and gold outfit played a song similar to "Simple Gifts" on a flute. Except, I believe she, too, was acting. Then, she got up and sprinkled glitter on the bodies. (Note: Here's a sign I've been corrupted by working with Jesse crew. My first thought when she started sprinkling glitter, "You can't have glitter on stage!") Then they got up and started dancing. Then they all left. Then a girl came on and sang a song. I think part of it was in gaelic, so I spaced out. Then, a bunch of girls came on and danced, highlighted by the girl in the gold top. Then, a bunch of boys came out and danced. They were wearing armour and masks, except Fake Michael Flatley, who was wearing a mask and a shirt with a sequined Celtic knot on it. I was glad that he wore pants, and not tights, because only superheroes should be wearing masks and tights. Then this girl in a red dress danced around by herself. Then the boys came on wearing frat-boy dance outfits -- black t-shirt, black pants. Fake Michael Flatley (FMF) really tore it up on this one. And I decided that he was a pretty good looking fellow. Then some girls came out and played the fiddle. That was really good. Then the girls came out. They danced. And, then the girl in the red came out, and so the other girls took off their dresses and danced in short tops and shorts. That was strange. Oh, also at one time, the girl in red and the girl in the gold top (who was now wearing a white top) danced around. FMF came out, too. Girl in red tried to take him, but he went with the girl in the white top. I'm guessing this was a good thing. And, then everyone (exept the glitter girl (GG)) came out wearing red. And they all danced. It was amazing. Then FMF pointed at the audience, and the lights went out. End Act 1. Then I got a pretzel. So, at the beginning of Act 2, GG starts playing that flute again. Then FMF and the boys in armour came on stage. They stole her flute, played keep away for a while, then broke it in half. I wasn't really sad about this. I didn't like GG or her flute. Anyway, this was the point in the show where I realized there was a storyline, not just a lot of dancing. So, then guess who came to the rescue? FAKE MICHAEL FLATLEY!!! This is when I realized that there wasn't just one lead boy dancer, and the boy in the armour was not actually FMF. So, I started thinking of him as Bizarro Fake Michael Flatley (BFMF). Well, FMF got the flute parts back from BFMF, and he and his boys chased of BFMF and his boys. Then FMF put the flute behind his back, and when he brought it back, it was fixed! Hooray. Well, BFMF was not saying hooray, because some of his henchmen went and kidnapped FMF and brought him to BFMF's lair. Things were not looking good for Fake Micahel Flatley. Except that the show was named after his character, so fate was probably on his side. Anyway, first the armour boys danced around him in a circle, which was really cool. Oh, and they took off his belt, which I noticed was exceptionally large. Then they showed off the belt. It was very WWE-esque. I'm guessing this is the belt you get when you are "The Lord of the Dance." Then they made FMF go up a ramp to a ledge. Then, right when BFMF pointed at him, which I'm assuming meant something bad was going to happen, GG showed up and threw, you guessed it, glitter. I guess this saved FMF, because he disappeared, but then showed up on another ledge -- wearing a different shirt! Then, he slid down a firepole, and he fought (translation: danced around with) BFMF. And, then he got his belt back. Oh, also at one point FMF danced with the gold-top girl, except she was wearing red. Then the girls came out wearing red, and the boys came out wearing TUXEDOS?! I was very confused by this. But, not as confused as when they came out wearing day-glow orange, yellow and pink cosutmes! WHAT?! At the end everyone came out in silver and black outfits and they danced. This was the best part. It was actually really good. Sorry this was so long.

      A USA Today story says that  urlLink those who attend church services at least once a week are more likely to vote Republican than Democratic.  I must be the exception. As far as Catholics go, I think it's safe to say a lot of it has to do with abortion. At a dinner for CCD teachers, I heard this conversation: Lady 1, "I just don't know who I'm going to vote for. I mean, neither is too appealing." Lady 2, "Yeah, but at least you know one's for abortion and one is pro-life." I wanted to yell, "But what about the death penalty?! What about the war!? What about social justice?! Abortion isn't the only issue where politicians go against the Vatican!" But, I didn't really feel it was my place. But I must say I was relieved to read  urlLink this article  that says some Catholics don't understand how people can base their vote on a single issue that was decided 30 years ago and probably won't change under new administration. We've had a "pro-life" president for four years. And, under this "pro-life" president, we've had 700+ service men and women killed in Iraq, and while this "pro-life" man was governor more than a few people were executed in Texas. Has abortion been outlawed? No. So, it's a good thing he's in office, protecting lives. Sorry to vent. I'll try to keep my posts lighter and more pirate-related in the future.

      I learned this story at dinner last night. How true it is, I don't know, but it's the story they tell kids at the elementary school. The Wahp and Breck sit where three rivers meet. So, back in the day, Breckenridge was quite a hub for trading. Then in 1862  urlLink  the city was ravaged by a fire . The link said it was the Sioux that set the fire, but the story I heard last night said that it was pirates from the riverboats. PIRATES!!! In Breck!! Awesome. Now, this is the best part that they tell the kids. If that fire hadn't burnt down the city, it might have grown to become the next Chicago. Darn those pirates!

      Yesterday was a beautiful day. Mid 70s. Light breeze. Perfect for a run OUTSIDE! After work I hopped in my car and with the window down and Marching Mizzou playing the fight song in my CD player, I drove around town to find and measure a good route. (When  I'm not running in a circle on a track or on a machine, I worry about starting, going, then dying miles from my car. This way I knew where I needed to go and that I'd be able to survive.) First I was going to run on the gravel roads about a half-mile outside of town. This is for two reasons, 1) Ask my siblings, and they'll tell you I run like a weirdo, and 2) I figured the ND gravel roads are probably on a grid, and I'd be able to keep track of distance really easily. Then, I decided to run on the bike trail at the park instead. I couldn't measure it, but that was ok. In fact, then I didn't  think  at all about when I hit my miles, if I was running far enough, etc. I just enjoyed it. The trail runs just yards from the Red River and past the zoo, golf course, a historic carousel and chapel, and a park. It was beautiful! The familiar sound of feet hitting the asphalt combined with breathing in through the nose, out through the mouth, made me nostaligic for track. FOR TRACK! I didn't like track when I was in it, how would I have fond memories now? Anyway, I only ran for 30 minutes and probably didn't even cover 3 miles, but it was great. I think I'll do it again. Then, supper just kept the good times coming. Beer cheese soup at The Wilkin, you just can't go wrong with that! Plus, I had a reason to wear my heeled flip-flops. And, I took my lime-green purse. The whole experience made me think I'll probably miss North Dakota a little. Well, late-spring North Dakota, anyway. Still not too keen on winter North Dakota.

       Crowd at sporting event:  Boooo! You suck ref! A rope! A tree! Hang the referee! A rope! A tree! Hang the referee!...   Voice of Reason: Wait! You've got it all wrong! If we get rid of the referee, who will officiate the game? There wouldn't be a game. And then where would the kids be? Out in the streets, tempted by vandolism, sex and drugs. We shouldn't be harassing officials, we should be thanking them, taking them out for coffee, showing our appreciation. So, let's try that again. A hamburger, a coffee, hug the referee! Seriously, someone was paid to write this?

      So, Frankie finally left the Real World. The Real World house, that is. Whether or not she's ever been in the Real World is to be determined. Still, I enjoyed the commercial with the girl writing a letter to MTV. She says, essentially, "I've noticed that every season there seems to be one crazy person in the house. And they all seem to be from Kansas City. What's with this? Do you have some kind of agreement with Kansas City? If so, I'd like to know more about it."

      Last night I watched a show on the Discovery Channel called "Big." If you have a chance, you should watch this. They point of the show is that they build giant, functional things. Last night they built a huge blender that made a 1000 gallon smoothie. A special bonus is that there's a "designer" who doesn't really fit in with the engineers, welders, builders, etc. There was drama. It was funny. I didn't think it would actually work, because the blades were so giant, but the fruit was regular size. I didn't think the blades would cut up the strawberries and bananas. But, I was wrong. It worked. Next, they're making a giant popcorn popper, and later they're making a giant electric guitar!

      I was at Target on Sunday, and I bought a CD by an unknown-to-me artist just because it was cheap and it included "I Get a Kick Out of You" and "Singin' in the Rain." So, I figured anyone who covers those songs can't be all bad. The verdict: I LOVE IT. Anyway, it's called Twentysomething by Jamie Cullum, and I listened to it about 17 times while packing --that's right, I was actually packing! -- yesterday, and I still don't hate it. I'm listening to it now! I give it a solid recommendation.

      I love Lance Bass. This weekend I was fortunate enough to catch his movie, "On the Line" on ABC Family. Lance's character meets a girl on the train. She asks him to tell her something he'd only tell a stranger. He says, "This sounds really lame, but I can name all the presidents in order." That's not lame! I can do that! Then, they proceed to name all the presidents in order -- and they did it wrong! They only said Grover Cleveland once. C'mon, Lance! The other best part of the movie was at the end, when they were doing a "behind the scenes" and Chris Kirkpatrick and Justin Timberlake were posing as the hair and makeup people (JC must have been too busy growing a mullet). Justin Timberlake said, "*N Sync? More like *N STINK!" And then I laughed, because I don't really like Justin Timberlake, and I do think he stinks.

      Last night I heard a HORRIBLE thing on Jay Leno. Jay was asking Vin Diesel about his connection to Nicole Kidman, because apparantly at one time they were linked. Vin said they went to a business dinner to discuss upcoming projects. I thought, "Yeah, right, Vin. The lady has an Oscar. She doesn't have to be in your movies." Then he said, "Yeah, we want to remake  Guys and Dolls . I'd be Sky Masterson and she'd be Sargent Sarah." WHAT?! No. This fall my brother and I played "(Re)Cast movie versions of musicals." We are nerds. The one that was the most fun was  Guys and Dolls.  This one went on for days. We'd think of the perfect actor/actress for a part and call the other right away. I don't think I need to tell you that Vin Diesel was not included in our cast. We considered Nicole for Sarah, but felt we would rather go with Gwyneth. You must be wondering, who makes up the rest of the cast? Why, I'll tell you... Sky Masterson: Harry Connick, Jr. Nathan Detroit: Tom Hanks Sarah Brown: Gwyneth Paltrow Adelaide: Megan Mullally Nicely Nicely Johnson: Matthew Broderick I get fuzzy on the rest. Honestly, I was fuzzy on those. I'm not 100 percent sure Tom Hanks was our Nathan Detroit. He was at one time, but we may have moved him. And I don't remember who played Brannigan, but we had a good one. For some of the other, non-singing gangsters we included Matthew McConaughey and maybe Matt Damon. And, Robbie Williams would be in the trio sining the Fugue for Tinhorns at the beginning. That one was my idea. Maybe Vin can be a gangster, but he CANNOT be Sky. Wouldn't Harry be infinitely better? I think so. Your suggestions would be appreciated. Maybe we can pass them on to whatever studio is thinking doing this, and we can prevent them from making the American public listen to Vin Diesel sing.

       urlLink This extra bowl game accomplishes nothing. Does it help in finding the "true" National Champion? No. Does it help smaller schools sneak into the lucrative BCS bowls? Theoretically. But, when was the last time the No. 9 and No. 10 schools were not from the major conferences? I'm too lazy to do the research, but I'm guessing it was long ago. A small school would need to go undefeated to crack the top 10. All this does is add another bowl to the already saturated bowl season.

      Dear Royals: Last week I did the unthinkable. I stopped caring. But, today when I looked at the standings, something changed. I saw 9.5. A wave of delusional optimism swept over me. Single digits. If things go well today, we could be within eight. Eight. I  want  to believe again, Royals. I'm sorry I stopped believing. I hope you can forgive me. You should. After all, I've forgiven you for continuing to allow Curtis Leskanic to pitch. Seriously, please stop doing that. Your fan forever, Kara

      First, let me say that I'm very happy that  urlLink Dave Beckham  is going to be the new face of Gillette. Now, let me tell you how angry Gillette's M3Power Razor commercials make me. It's not so much the notion of a battery-powered razor enhancing the shaving experience as their opening line. "There is a power that you will do anything to get your hands on." Really?! You realize you're selling a razor, and not the power of flight, invisibility, teleportation or any other super power. Maybe your razor does contain a power that people are willing to "do anything" to acquire. If by "do anything" you mean "shill out 20 bucks." Again, one of those things that shouldn't make me angry, but it does.

      Here's a headline on the Fargo Forum's online front page:  urlLink "Don't forget your IDs if voting today in N.D."  Really? I know Rob didn't have any trouble voting in the primary, but really, do we have to put a headline in the paper telling people they need to bring ID? Even  I  bring ID when I vote absentee, and I vote in Platte County, where the election board not only knows who I am, they know why I'm not going to be in town to vote. I think the best part is that there's an icon at the bottom saying "Talk about this story." Really? People are going to discuss bringing ID to vote?! Oh, and a utility bill counts as ID. With such undeniable sources of ID as a utility bill, I'd say North Dakota has  no  chance of ever having cases of voter fraud. Does a utility bill count as ID everywhere in North Dakota? I want to see some under-age NDSU student go to a bar in Fargo and present a water bill when asked for ID. Hey, if it lets you vote, it should let you drink!

      *I don't own any TV shows on DVD, but I think I would buy season 1 of Arrested Development and all the seasons of Ed. In fact, Ed had an appearance in one of my dreams lately. It made me realize how much I miss that show. *I'm thinking of jumping on the re-design boat. Let's face it, sometimes I get windy, and this format is not condusive to my occasional long rants. *ABC Family ran a movie starring a buzz-cut wearing Joseph Lawrence. Hey, pal, even if you change your name and give yourself a buzz-cut, people are still going to know that you're Joey Lawrence. Sorry. *Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think golf etiquette includes peeing behind trees. This fact escaped a couple at the open on Friday. *Yesterday a terrible thing happened. The Royals lost, and I didn't get that "blech" feeling. I just shrugged it off. This is the official beginning of apathetic baseball season. And there's still a long way to go. I'm quite sad.  *At the golf outing a lot of people asked if I was having fun. My reply once was "If there's a full-time job of sitting on a golf course, by a keg, in sunny, 80 degree weather, let me know where to apply." Then one guy answered, "Well, if you like being outside all day, boy do I have the job for you! Do you want a summer job? Because I have one." As this gentlemen kept edging himself into the "creepy" category, I quickly told him that I'm moving. But, man would I be kicking myself if he really  did  have a full-time job of sitting by a keg on a golf course. *Does it make me a bad person that I'm not sad about Ronald Reagan? It has nothing to do with politics, it's just that he's been "gone" for so long. We lost him a long time ago. *If I'm not a bad person for the above sentiment, am I a bad person for being angry every time I see a Scott Peterson trial story on the national news? Really, do I need to hear about this every day? What about this story warrants national news coverage? Because there was a national search put out for her when she first went missing, I can understand doing readers on actual developments. Scott's arrest, trial starting, verdict. Not much else. Daily trail updates? NOT NECESSARY. Maybe I'm cold, or maybe it's that I realize this isn't the first time a husband "allegedly" killed his wife.

      The golf tournament went well. I didn't drink that much, which was good. And, I got some free golf balls. Some of the golfers got on my nerves, but other than that, it was a good day.

      This will be the final post from The Wahp. I've been pretty surprised at how un-emotional I've been. Don't get my wrong, I've almost cried a lot. But I expected to actually cry a lot. There are a lot of things, mostly people, that I will miss about North Dakota, but I'm excited to move on. This morning I was feeling very rebellious, since it was my last day. I decided I was going in late, leaving early and I wasn't going to iron my pants! Well, I ended up ironing my pants a little bit (There's a pocket flap that was doing crazy things, but I didn't iron the rest. Take that, world!), I was still the first person in my office, and since I'm not very adept at running Macs, it took me WAY longer than I anticipated to print screen shots of my desktop folders so that the next user will be able to find anything. This resulted in me not only not leaving early, but staying a little late. Oh, and leaving early wouldn't have even been rebelling, as my boss told me yesterday that it would be ok. But, I'm leaving The Wahp/Breck area in style. The folks and a friend roll in tomorrow afternoon. We'll golf on the  urlLink only course in America with nine holes in one state, nine in another , then we'll go to eat at The Wilkin, which means beer-cheese soup for me! Oh, and if I have anything to say about it, we're taking our picture by  urlLink Wahpper!

      Also, I thought a lot about up-to-bat music. I usually think about this anytime I attend a baseball game. Really, for someone who will never need up-to-bat music, I spend too much time and energy deciding what mine would be. Here's a short list of the candidates. Serious songs: 1) Let Me Entertain You. This will also be my theme song when I get a talk show. 2) Back in Black. This one's not very original, but I love it. It's a classic. Songs I would use just to see the reactions of the other team/the crowd: 1) Spice Up Your Life. 2) The Macarena. 3) Jingle Bells, by the Jingle Cats. Man, that would be AWESOME!

      1) I have a new career goal: to sit in a rocking chair on a baseball field. This is someone's job. It could be mine. And I, unlike the current job holder, would wear Redhawk attire, not overalls. 2)  urlLink Rob  is easily frightened. Once I just said, "Guess what?" and he looked a little scared. Sure, I said it with a little enthusiasm, but that's nothing to get all jumpy about. And, anyways, my news was exciting. I passed a car with Missouri plates on the way up to Fargo! 3) I learned this on the way home, not so much there. The Redhawks have a player with the last name Salazar. I thought that name sounded familir, and Rob thought he might have originally been in the KC system. Then, I realized, the name sounds familiar because of Harry Potter: Salazar Slytherin. I'm a nerd. 4) The Redhawks have awesome between-inning games, including one where blind-folded kids try to put spots on cows. One girl ran the opposite direction of the cow, and I believe she was close to putting spots on the third baseman before she was corralled. 5) The Redhawks should be thanked for only throwing peanuts to the crowd. The St. Joe Saints threw hot dogs, and the Royals shoot hot dogs out of a gun! I firmly believe that you should not eat a hot dog that you acquire by catching it amongst a crowd.

      *Last night I painted my nails. On one hand. Then forgot about the other. Thank goodness it's just a clear coat. *Speaking of clear, my senior class voted our class colors to be turd brown and clear. One of my friends got upset and made us re-vote. Too bad. Those would have been  awesome  class colors! Five years later, I'm still disappointed. *Speaking of, it's our five-year reunion this summer. Sadly, I won't be in attendance. Probably. *I got a "Mizzou Greek Alumni" email today. That is entirely unnecessary. Especially since it did not include anything about an exploding cannon. By the way, I still find that funny in a thank-goodness-nobody-was-hurt kind of way. *I half-watched the finale of WB Superstar USA last night. Jamie, this girl who screams everything and calls it singing and also wrote lyrics on her hands in the beginning because she couldn't remember them, won. And then they told her that it was all a joke and that she couldn't sing. And I don't think she got it, because she said, "Now that I'm the Superstar, the other star I can't wait to hang out with is Britney Spears. We're going to make an awesome video together." Um, no you aren't.

      I was very, VERY upset when I saw Prisoner of Azkaban and noticed that in one shot Harry's scar is over his left eye. Everywhere else it's over his right eye. I was quite upset about this. How did Daniel Radcliffe let this happen? Wouldn't he tell the make-up person "Ummm... I've been Harry Potter for three years, and that scar's always gone over my  right  eye."? So, I was planning on ranting about this, and I googled for a link, because surely someone else noticed. Well, they did. Apparantly, that scene was shot through a mirror, or something like that, so everything was supposed to be backwards. I take back everything bad I said.

      Japan doesn't think  urlLink  the current set-up of the proposed Baseball World Cup is fair.  Their biggest beef is that the MLB players' union and commisioner's office would split the profits.

      This is the beginning of an MLB.com article titled "Royals slump is no laughing matter."   Mike Sweeney, in the visitors' clubhouse the other day in Minnesota, was bringing reporters up to date on his back injury. Then he was asked about the Royals' hitting malaise.  Hitting coach Jeff Pentland happened to be wandering past.   "Ask Pent," Sweeney said. "Pent?"   "What do you think the problem is with our offense right now?" Sweeney asked. "Besides Carlos Beltran being in Houston, me and Joe Randa on the sidelines, Juan Gonzalez in Arizona -- what else?"   Pentland, other than still being in his underwear, exuded his usual professorial demeanor.   "Well, those are good starts," Pentland said amiably. "Like I don't know half the guys that are here."   Sweeney laughed good-naturedly.

      I point that out to prove that my hopes for the season were not purely Kara delusions. Now, we've just been swept AND shut out three games by the Twins. At least they were close; we lost the three by a combined 25-0. You gotta feel good about that. On the bright side, we're only 9.5 games back -- of the fourth place Tigers. DETROIT! WE'RE ALMOST 10 GAMES BACK OF DETROIT! It makes me very sad.

      Earlier I mentioned that I noticed Jessica Simpson singing Robbie Williams' "Angels." The clip on saw on the TV channel seemed unoffensive. Well, that song came on the radio as I tried to go to sleep last night, and there's only one word for it. BUTCHERED. It's a beautiful song, and you a beautiful voice, so there's no reason to go overboard on the stylization, lady! Just sing it! It'll sound good! But, now it sucks, and that made me very angry when I went to sleep. On the bright side, I did unpack my Robbie Williams calendar yesterday, and in the July picture he is very pretty. Hooray!

      Last post June 18! That's crazy. Anyway, for anyone who might still read this since I appeared to drop off the face of the Earth, a million points. Also, I'm probably ending the points tally once I reformat, which will tentatively happen late this week when I finally get a phone line/Internet in my apartment. (Yes, I still use dial-up. I'm poor. It's cheap.) Here's a quick recap of the last 2 1/2 weeks: 1. I got the A/C fixed in my car! YEAH! 2. Went to CoMO. Good times were had by all. Well, they were had by me, anyway. I can't speak for the rest of you jokers. 3.Carlos Beltran is traded. BOOOOOO. 4. Go to Royals game with friends on Friday! YEAH! 5. Royals lose. Booooo. 6. Sit in the rain for more than an hour waiting for the Royals game on Sunday. Boo. 7. Royals lose. Boooo. 8. Drive directly from Kauffman to Grand Rivers, Ky. for family reunion. Meh. 9. Stop in Metropolis, Ill. to take pictures with Superman! YEAH! It's been a long time since I've seen my brother so excited. He actually said, "Yeah, this really made my day! Now, take one with just me and Superman, and I'm going to frame it and hang it up!" Metropolis has about 6500 people in it, and there was a sign with a line for an arrow that said "Giant Statue," except, it didn't point anywhere! There was no arrow! So, it's about midnight, there's nothing open, we drive through what we think is the entire town without seeing Superman. So, I hop in a Days Inn and ask the lady through protective glass (why is this necessary?) where the giant Superman statue is. Now, if I lived/worked in a town of 6500 people and one giant statue, I could tell you where the statue lived. She acted as if I just asked her to explain nuclear physics. She starts fretting, "Ummm.... Ummmm...." then she turns around and lifts her arm up as if she's drawing in the air. Then, she figures out there's a map with the giant statue mapped on it. Hooray! Now I can get out of here. No. She proceeds to give directions, naming what I'm convinced is every building along the way. Look, lady, I don't care. I can see where it is on the map. I can find it now. I don't know where the Nations Bank is, so if you say, past the Nations Bank it means nothing. JUST GIVE ME THE MAP. Anyway, it was a small adventure, that I was glad to take. And, now I hope all of you have the Superman theme song in your head..... now quick! Switch to Star Wars! Tricky, isn't it. I love that game. Try it with your friends. 10. Family reunion. It was good. Hard at times, but good. And, I did play a LOT of Texas Hold 'Em with my cousins. And I always lost. And then we rode Go-Karts at a very sketchy track where, I'm not making this up, some of the employees were BAREFOOT! I was never passed, and I lapped my brother the second time around. Sadly, my disposable camera flew out of my pocket and was run over. Several times. Dead. But, fortunately it was a new one and the Superman pictures were not on it! 11. A/C in my car breaks leaving Kentucky to go to Alabama. Booo. It is hot from Kentucky to Alabama. 12. Move in. Meh. 13. Take car to get it fixed. I'm told it's my compressor, and that it will run about $700. I tell them I'm going to get a second opinion, thank you very much. 14. Pretty much stayed in over the weekend watching movies and playing Sims. Sadly, Bridget McDuffy died of an unknown illness that I believe was caused by the guinea pig. And, what did her husband James do right afterwards? Mourn? No. He got a snack. That James...  14. Register for classes. Well, class. I'm only taking one. Sport Finance. Um, blech. And the building and classroom is listed as TBA. WHAT?! Classes start TOMORROW. Just  when  are you going to announce it?! 15. And now I'm posting this. Hooray?

      You have to imagine me yelling that title, like Capt. Kirk yelling, "Kahn!!!" Anyway, that's how angry I am. It looks like the Baseball World Cup  urlLink will be pushed back to 2006 . Wait. A World Cup in 2006? I think there's already one scheduled. But, soccer doesn't draw more international interest that baseball, does it? I understand that Japan's leagues want input in how it's going to be run. But it's not as if MLB is just making up their own rules. They had to have the players' association agree to IBF drug-testing standards. They're going by international rules. The only thing is MLB is running the thing. And, call me crazy, but I think MLB is the biggest force in baseball, not the international governing body. MLB will be affected the most by a World Cup. Yes, Japan and South Korea's leagues will be affected. Some. But, their national rosters will be filled first with MLBers, then with those in their own leagues.

      When I moved, we came directly from Kentucky to Alabama. My dad drove my car to Kentucky, because I was waiting for Kristi who was going to the Royals game. So, I took out of my car all my CDs except the ones I thought he'd like. The rest I brought into the house, planning on bringing them in the car we were taking to Kentucky. Planning. Didn't happen so much. So now I have a limited number of CDs, and very few of them are CDs that had earned a spot in "the rotation." And only one is Robbie. ONE. And it's Swing While You're Winning, which I love, but since the bulk of the remaining CDs are crooners, it's not all that special. I also have Tom Jones. I love Tom Jones, but, I can only handle so much. And I've exceeded that limit. And it's made me angry at Tom. And he doesn't deserve that. I can't wait until my mom mails me the rest.

Last night's shows ('90 & 91) were ok. Here's a recap if you missed 1991. Included: Rico Suave. Not included: Operation Desert Storm. Ok, maybe you don't include wars in shows with the words "I Love" in the title. But, you could at least have mentioned the Scud Stud. Or what people at home were doing. This war was televised like none before it. It made an impact. Of course, I'm not saying Rico Suave  didn't ...

      From ESPN.com:  AL Least Valuable Player (LVP) of the Half-Year JUAN GONZALEZ, ROYALS -- Gonzalez spent the winter working out wearing a shirt that read "162" on the front. That was supposed to represent the number of games he planned to play. Of course, he never promised he'd play them all this year. He was last seen pulling up with a tight back while running to first base after a ground ball May 21. He was described, at the time, as being day-to-day. It's now seven weeks -- and zero at-bats -- later. And still no sign of him. You'd like to give the guy the benefit of the doubt, since he is a two-time MVP. But after 11 trips to the disabled list and countless episodes just like this one, even his own teammates have been grumbling to friends about him. If this guy can't get inspired to play for Tony Pena, you have to wonder if he's about to run out of teams to employ him. SIGHS OF RELIEF FOR: Pick a Mariner. Any Mariner.

      I have, they just don't include the ability to win at Texas Hold 'Em. Anyway, last night's show featured the cast of Arrested Development. I love this show, and in turn love those actors. I also love David Foley. He's a riot. Last night, Phil said, "Player A and Player B both have a pair of tens, but Player A leads right now because he has the Jack high kicker." Then, Dave Foley says, "Sometimes poker players call the high kicker a Rockette! Right, Phil! Right!" Then there's a long pause, and Phil says, very begrudgingly, "Sometimes poker players call the high kicker a Rockette." It was awesome. Also, David Cross, who plays Tobias on Arrested Development is very strange. Also strange, included with the A.D. cast was one random guy from Six Feet Under. It was driving me crazy, because I kept thinking, "Who is that?! Who does he play?! I've never seen him on the show!" Then, finally that crazy Dave was going through what the players were doing, "Jason stays. He's on Arrested Development. Will stays. He's on Arrested Development. Peter folds. That's because he's not on Arrested Development." And, the mystery was solved...

Anyway, in attendance were John Kerry, John Edwards, GW Bush and GHW Bush. I got all four of them together to take a picture, but my camera wasn't working quite right. The strangest part about this dream was not that these men were at my high school, but that I didn't want to punch GWB in the face. I didn't even give him a dirty look. There were no secret service guys around, I totally could have gotten away with a shin kick. But, I just wanted to take a picture. With my broken camera.

      In 1999, the Royals had their worst season ever when they finished 64-97 with a .398 winning percentage. Then, in 2002 they topped that with the great 100 loss season, finishing 62-100 with a .383 winning percentage. Well, now we're sitting at 34-58 (.370), and are poised to finish, yet again, with the worst season in franchise history. That's three worst-ever seasons in five years! Who can stand this?! Royals fans, and I'm not just saying this because I am one, deserve a medal. Oh, also in my dream last night, Mike Sweeney was traded to the Yankees. I was almost physically ill.

      Have you seen Andy Richter's new show on FOX,  Quints?  It's terrible. First of all, not only does this fictional set of parents deserve a punch in the face for giving all five of the kids names that start with 'P,' but the writers also deserve a punch in the face because, naturally all five kids would be&nbsp;completely different. You have the blonde, pretty, peppy and popular Paige, then there's Parker, a cool, boy-version of Paige, then there's Penny, brunnette, sad and brooding. Then there's Pierce. He's just plain crazy. He's the weirdo. Then, there's Patton, who I'm guessing is the "runt of the litter," as he's about a foot shorter than the rest of the kids. Ok, if you can show me a family of five children where they share absolutely no physical or character traits, I will take back everything bad I've thought about this show. But, until then, it makes me angry. And, it wouldn't make me as angry if Andy Richter wasn't in it. Because, he can do better than this crap.

      The KC Star lists 5 urlLink  reasons the Tigers will and 5 reason the Tigers won't  win the Big XII North. I like that one "won't" is that MU is just plain unlucky. D'oh! It's true!

      I guess that's kind of stereotypical, because I don't know where "Dave" was from. But, anyway, my brother is now safe and sound in Taiwan. He was supposed to leave right after Memorial Day, but being a Moran adventure, it was pushed back until next week... no, next week... maybe in two weeks... and so on. I'm glad he finally made it. He's gracious enough to keep the world up to date with his goings on through his  urlLink blog. &nbsp;He thinks he's pretty funny. He kind of is. Anyway, if you like reading about eating mysterious food and riding on scooters, then this is the blog for you!

       urlLink Scott 's post reminded me about a traumatic experience I had at Subway on Saturday. I've had the same Subway sandwich (6" Spicy Italian, lettuce, tomato, pickles, olives and jalepenos) since I was a freshman in high school, excluding Friday's during lent, but that probably accounts for less than five. So, imagine my horror when I went to&nbsp;a Subway in Montgomery, ordered a Spicy Italian, and the guy looked at me like I was a space alien.  Subway man: Did you say  Spicy Italian?  Me: Yes. Six inch, please. Subway man, more confused than ever: Ummmm... do you mean Italian BMT, because I've never heard of Spicy Italian. I actually think this frightened him. He asked his manager, and he acted like I just didn't know the difference.  Manager: She must mean Italian BMT. No. I did not. I know my way around a Subway menu, thank you very much. I'm not just making up sandwiches. If there are no Spicy Italian sandwiches in Alabama, as far as I'm concerned, there might as well not even be Subways. Grrr.   &nbsp;

      I'm not a big fan of "the rap music."&nbsp; However, I did purchase The Streets'  A Grand Don't Come for Free  this weekend. I love it.&nbsp;And, I don't think it probably technically counts as rap. And, it's just plain funny. Not as funny as the French rapping busker&nbsp;on the metro, but close.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could listen to "Fit But You Know It" all day. And since I'm here by myself, I just might.

      I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I love Lance Bass. In the '98 episode, the panelists were discussing John Glenn going back into space. Here's what Lance said: "I thought it was great when John Glenn went into space. It just goes to show ( said threw clenched teeth)  any age can go into space!" I think after the edit, Lance probably shook his fist. And, I think Lance probably talks about going into space like I talk about getting a robot.

      Zubaz pants in 1996? Really? If this is true, it would be the one time in the history of the world that CPMO was  ahead  of a trend. And, also if this is true, why did the&nbsp;boys wearing Zubaz pants in the video clips have permed mullets? And why were they break dancing? And why did the graphics look ancient? And why does the&nbsp; urlLink Bad Fads Museum    say they were from 1991?! I'm warning you right now, VH1,  never lie to me again.

      Here's a quick note about where I stand on cover songs. Some are ok. Others suck. The ones that suck infuriate me. I'm looking at you, Madonna. Or Esther. Whoever you are.&nbsp;Anyway, I've talked about creating a music tribunal for years. If you want to cover a song, you would have to go in front of the music tribunal and plead your case for why you should be able to cover that song. There would be several criteria, the first would be that you must prove that it won't suck. This is the most important. Anyway, I was very glad to read this in Bill Simmon's mailbag on ESPN.com's Page 2 (I added the bold): &nbsp; Q: What are the rules singers/bands should stick to as they apply to covering songs? I can't stand to see no-talent pop stars covering songs -- Clay Aiken covering "Bridge Over Troubled Water" or Jessica Simpson covering "Take My Breath Away." Do you think NO ONE should be able to cover a song without having at least five certifiable hits in their past?-- Tim Rusch  Jimmy Kimmel: I'm not sure that your "five-hit" criteria helps any, considering the fact that Madonna covered "American Pie" and Duran Duran did "911 is a Joke." Then again, the greatest argument against cover songs was, is and always will be UB40.   Bill Simmons: I think the song has to be different enough that it stands apart from the original version. Like when the Smashing Pumpkins did "Landslide," or the White Stripes sang "I Don't Know What To Do With Myself." Anything else is a violation. Like how the Ataris became famous for basically ripping off Don Henley's "The Boys of Summer," the defining "roll the windows down, it's time for summer!" song of the mid-'80s. Or the Foo Fighters re-doing "Darling Nikki," which made me want to punch somebody. Even when No Doubt re-did "It's My Life" by Talk Talk, I thought that was a violation. There's no reason to cover a song that was already good on its own, unless you're going to make it sound completely different.  We need to legislate this or something.  &nbsp; Exactly! We need to legislate this. Now that Bill Simmons is on board, maybe we can get this thing moving!

      I was led to this realization by a couple things, the most recent of which are: 1) My boss asking me, "So, what do you  do? " and me not having a response. 2) My car being in the shop until Monday afternoon, which means I'm homebound for the weekend with nothing to do but watch TV and play Sims. (Ok, I have a few chores to do, but nothing to occupy 2 1/2 days.) The thing is, I do not have the attention span for a hobby. There is no way I could ever complete the projects that  urlLink Kristin  does. It took me 2 1/2 years to finish that darn family crest! I need to think of something that takes very little time. And is not complicated, because, let's face it, Martha Stewart, I'm not. Judging by the previous sentence, littering my sentences with commas could be a hobby, but that is not a way to fill a homebound weekend with fun. Anyway, it's not so much a hobby as a bad habit. And, baking/cooking is out. So, if you have any suggestions, they'd be appreciated. Thanks!

      Here's the excerpt from ESPN.com on today's coaches' poll:  17. Missouri(502 points, 8-5 and No. 17 in '03 final poll)Is this the year Brad Smith lives up to the hype? Smith, a dangerous threat running and passing, and the Tigers are talented enough to win the Big 12 North.   First of all, we received one vote -- one -- in the final poll, so nice try, fact checkers. Secondly, what do you mean, "Is this the year Brad Smith lives up the the hype?" That implies that he hasn't in the past. I would strongly disagree with this. Two 2000/1000 (ok, one was just almost, but still)&nbsp;seasons and being a key part in the upward climb of the program probably lives up the hype one would receive when he's offered scholarships to football powerhouses Missouri and West Virginia. Does he have hype this year? Yes. But, I'd argue that nationally, he didn't before. Grrrrr.

      Last night I watched the first episode of UPN's  Amish in the City.  It was great. There are five Amish kids who are currently doing the Amish coming-of-age tradition where they leave the Amish lifestyle and explore the world. This way they can make an educated decision when they decide to remain Amish. These five kids are living with six (I think six, anyway)&nbsp;regular "city" kids. The city kids didn't know the Amish kids were going to be living with them. It was certainly interesting. However, two things drove me crazy. 1) The show looked like it had been recorded with a digital glitch. It looked like when you have a glitch on your DVC tape, and it skips around. It did that on a regular basis for the entire two hours. I don't know if that was the fault of Montgomery UPN or if all UPN stations looked like that, but it drove me crazy. 2) There's an Amish boy named Mose. The city kids kept calling him Moses. It also drove me crazy. However, these frustrations were worth it when I witnessed what could possibly be the best exchange ever on reality television. Three Amish kids and one city girl, who is a Vegan, went grocery shopping. The city girl was in charge. Amish kid 1: We need eggs. Vegan: That's a chicken abortion. Amish kid 2: I bet Abraham Lincoln ate eggs. Vegan: Yeah, well Abraham Lincoln died when he was, like, 35. Awesome.&nbsp;

      * I LOVE mini powdered donuts. I could eat my weight in them.  * Yesterday at lunch the following was actually said as my boss reached for the Heinz ketchup: "You know that using that is practically supporting that damn liberal John Kerry." I think he was kind of joking, however, the comment kept more than one person from using ketchup. THen when they decided they&nbsp; really  wanted ketchup, they started pretending it was Hunt's.&nbsp;Ahh, Red State. * I haven't watched much of the convention, however I did see Clinton's speech. He did a very good job of reminding me&nbsp;why I have such a strong dislike for this administration. * The pop machine has been sold out here for 3+ weeks. Get with the program, Coke man! * Yesterday, the Royals lost 10-1 to Tampa Bay. 10-1 to Tampa Bay. Let that sink in a while, and then feel sorry for me and what they're putting me through. * Speaking of the Royals,  urlLink Rob Neyer 's website does a great job of explaining just how bad this team is, and how frustrating it is to be a fan. Scroll down to where all the text is in bold for the best example. * Here is the best line from my  urlLink brother's Taiwan blog : "Explaining to a guy who speaks very little&nbsp;English the difference between New Jersey and Missouri and why neither one has any crocodiles&nbsp;can take it out of you.&nbsp;" I don't know why they were talking about crocodiles, but I think it's awesome that they were. * Last year sometime there was an alligator in a pond on campus. That is not awesome. * There's a red English phone booth on Troy's campus. I don' t know why it's there, but I approve.

      Besides the fact that he's in the running for "Best movie cameo by an athlete ever," he's just unbelievable. And it's making me very angry that on ESPN they're comparing Lance to Barry Bonds. Their question, why does America love Lance, when we're skeptical about Barry. Afterall, they both battle doping allegations. Well, here's one difference: Lance has to take frequent drug tests, Barry doesn't. And, oh, yeah, Barry's trainer is indicted on charges of distributing steroids. And, there's the fact that Barry acts like a jerk at times. But, this of course led to Michael Wilbon coming to the conclusion that Americans don't love Barry Bonds because he's an arrogant African-American athlete. Because Americans embrace loud-mouthed, arrogant white athletes. Just ask John Rocker or Jeremy Shockey.

      I rented five movies to watch this weekend and next week. I did the old, "I'll get old releases (translate: cheap) movies that I haven't seen yet, or that look good but I've never heard of them" plan. Then, I was quite upset when I discovered that at Movie Gallery, all DVD rentals are the same price. What a rip-off. So, I spent about an hour picking out old movies, when I could have grabbed five new movies. Angry, I tell you. Anyway, here are the movies I've watched so far, in the order of viewing. 1) The Anniversary Party. This was written by and stars Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh. I thought it was supposed to be funny. Nope. Depressing. 2) Pumpkin. This stars Christina Ricci as a girl living the perfect life: in a good sorority, has a stud athlete boyfriend, she's popular, bla bla bla. Then, her sorority decides they're going to up their chances of getting Sorority of the Year by teaming up with the "Challenged Games." Christina Ricci is paired up with a mentally-handicapped boy named Pumpkin, and I don't even care that I'm about to spoil the movie because it was awful, and then she falls in love with him. It was even more disturbing than The Anniversary Party. 3) Fargo. I figured since I lived nearby for a year,&nbsp;I should see this movie. What I found odd about it was that, despite its name, the movie spent about 2 minutes actually in Fargo. The majority was spent in Minneapolis or in Brainerd, home of Central Lakes Community College. I guess "Brainerd" doesn't have the same ring to it as "Fargo." Anyway, it was the best of the three.

      So, I'm pretty excited after my victory in the Sprint store.&nbsp; I'm thinking, "Yes! Kara 1, World 0!" Then, I call my mom to gloat. Then, I notice the water-level light come on in my car. Then, I drive to Wal-Mart to get water, and my car literally dies as I'm pulling into the auto-center parking lot. And, I'm not exactly in a space yet. This is not good. My car was overheating. So, I'm panicked, and I go inside to get water, then put it into the coolant container, and I wait a bit for the engine to cool a little. I'm able to start the car back up and pull it&nbsp;into a spot.&nbsp;Then, I ask the Wal-Mart people if they check radiator fluid. They don't. Then, I see that my&nbsp;car already has a&nbsp;puddle underneath it.&nbsp;The Wal-Mart guy, who is very helpful, looks at it and says there's a leak, either in the radiator, or in the radiator hose. This sucks, my friends. It about 6:30 on a Saturday, and I'm 45 miles from my apartment with a car that doesn't work.&nbsp;So, I call my motor club, like AAA, but it's not AAA. Anyway, they call back and say that nobody will take my car tonight because they won't be able to work on it until Monday morning, and they don't have a safe place to park it overnight. So, they ask if I want it towed to my house. I tell her that I live 45 miles away, and she fortunately tells me that I'm covered for 100 miles. I ask if I'll then be able to have it towed somewhere on Monday morning. She says yes. I'm glad. So, now I just have to wait for the tow-truck to come.&nbsp; It's really hot, and since I wasn't planning on spending time in non-air-conditioned areas, I'm very smartly wearing jeans. D'oh! So, I go inside and get some food, because I haven't eating since breakfast. So, I get a sandwich, some plums and a CADBURY CHOCOLATE BAR!! This discovery makes me very happy. They had Dairy Milk and Fruit and Nut. I went for the Dairy Milk. It was AWESOME. Of course, as I'm waiting in line I see there's a McDonald's in this Super Wal-Mart. I consider ditching my items for Mickey D's, but there's that chocolate bar. So I keep them. Then, I go back out the car, sit on the curb and eat my sandwich. This is when I discovered I had managed to find an ant hill. So, I sat in the car, with the window rolled down, so it wasn't too bad. The tow-truck came pretty quickly, about 7:45.&nbsp; The guy, who is wearing a shirt that read, "Relax, I'm a professional," hooked up my car, and we were off. Except, he needed to get diesel. We're about to an intersection when he says, "Is that Shell station to the right or left?" I tell him I have no idea. He decides it's on the right. We get to the light and discover, nope. On the left. So, after silently discussing this with the driver in the car in the actual left-turn lane, He turns left out of the right-turn lane. Awesome. So, after he gets gas, we get going. I realize this is the first time I've traveled in a car with flashing lights! Awesome. Then, I hope it will be the last. Of couse, we've got country music blaring. But, I'm not going to complain, because this guy is driving me all the way home. Then, he says, "Do you mind if I smoke?" I'm thinking, "Yes. In fact, I would hate it. But, it's your truck, and you're driving me 50 miles, I'm not going to tell you not to smoke." And, I say, "No. Not at all."  So, we're driving along, and he starts telling me about the accidents he's recently had to work. I start wishing we would talk about anything else in the world. Then, he asks if I like country music. I say, "Ummm.... it's ok." Then, he says, "That means no." And I feel like a jerk because he starts changing channels. Although, I don't feel too bad, because we still spend the majority of the time listening to country music. Finally, we get home, and he says he'll look at it for me. I find&nbsp;a flashlight in my car, go figure, and he discovers that it's a leaky hose. What a relief. So, now I'm just without a car for the day. Which sucks because I need to get groceries. I am OUT OF DIET DR PEPPER. And milk. And, I missed mass this morning. Which, I would feel worse about if I was fond of the priest here. Not sold on him yet.

      This story is long. You may want to get a snack. About a month or two ago, the plastic hinge on my cell phone broke. I thought that since the phone broke through everyday use, it was not my fault and should be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. So, in between moves, I stopped by the Sprint store where I purchased the phone. The "helpful" sales person took the phone to the back room to talk with his manager, and came out later telling me that it wasn't covered. But, that I could pay $4 for a month of insurance, then file a claim in 21 days. While I did enjoy the Sprint employee encouraging me to participate in Sprint phone insurance fraud, I politely declined.  Fast forward to last week, when Britt tells me she talked to Sprint people about the hinge breaking and was told that it's a common defect and should be replaced. I'm banging my head on the wall at this point, because my phone has just had its first birthday. Anyway, I decide I'm going to go to Montgomery to try again. Surely if it's common, and I explain that I tried to get it fixed before I'd had it a year, they'll be understanding. But, since I, and others, haven't had the best experience with Sprint in the past, I decide it would be wise to call ahead and check so that I don't drive the 45 miles --&nbsp;one way --&nbsp;for nothing. So I call. And am transferred. Then transferred again. Finally I get someone to tell me that yes, even though I've had the phone for longer than&nbsp;a year, it should be replaced. I ask her to make a note on my account so that when I get to Montgomery I'm not told otherwise. She gets a little huffy and says no. I get a little angry. So, I drive up to Montgomery, finally find the Sprint store, and get in "line." There was no real form of a line, which also made me crabby because when the sales person would say, "Who's next?" someone who came in after me would say, "I think I was." And this was a dirty, rotten lie. So, I wait, and wait, and wait, and finally this boy comes up to me and says, "Are you looking to start a new plan." I tell him, no, I need a new phone. He looks at my phone and says, "Yeah, that hinge breaking is common. But, the warranty would be voided because there are other exterior scratches." I tell him that's ridiculous, and he tells me not to give up and to talk to the two women who are working at the sales desk. So, I wait some more. Finally, I talk to Tammy, who is the first person I talked to on the phone. She tells me the same thing as the first boy. I also tell her that it's ridiculous that a common fault with the phone would be ignored because of a scratch on a completely different part of the phone. She says she can't help it.&nbsp;I say, "I'm not angry with you, because I know this isn't your call, but where can I go to file an official complaint with the company, because this is ridiculous." She tells me to talk with the manager. There is a line to talk to the manager, because let's face it, people don't go to the Sprint store to say, "Hey! My phone's working great! Thanks!" So, I'm waiting in line, and the boy comes out and says, "Did they get you fixed yet." And I say, "No, but I'm not finished." About this time, a different sales lady walks by, and the boy, (who I've discoved is named Clay and I don't know how I feel about this. I don't think you should name children after geological materials. So, Stone's out, too.)&nbsp; says, "Can you help this young lady..." and he goes on to explain the situation. I approach them and say, very calmly, "Look. I'm not angry with you, because I know this policy is above you. But, I just find this to be a very ridiculous policy, since it's a common defect in the phone. I also think that as new a service as cell phones are, people are not brand loyal yet. And, it's crazy how phone companies give people the run-around. What will it cost you to replace this phone for me, compared to what I will spend with Sprint if I continue to use you as my carrier for however many years I have cell phone?" Then, that sales lady, who is named Monica, says, "I'll see what I can do about this." And she goes into the back room for a while. Then, she has to help some other people, but eventually, she says, "We'll get you a new phone." And, I think that's pretty awesome. Then, as I'm walking around the circle of&nbsp; counters they have in the middle of the store, this boy says to me, "Did they make it right for you?" And I said yes. And it made me smile. Then, as Monica was tranferring my phone books, a man is told that because his phone got wet and there are exterior scratches, his warranty is voided. His response was&nbsp;a little different than mine. He starts yelling at poor Clay, going on about how it's unfair for them not to honor their warranty, and that this is poor customer service, and it's just plain ridiculous, and he's going to take them to court! He was really getting fired up, and I'm thinking, "No, buddy. That's not the speech that get's the new phone. You gotta use the brand-loyalty speech. Much more effective." Because, I tell you, the manager did not seem one&nbsp;bit concerned about this guy taking Sprint to court. It made me very glad that as fuming as I was at times, I was never rude - I thought, anyway, - and I was always calm. The only casualty: My 100,000 mile roll-over picture. That's a fine trade-off, if you ask me.

      This is why I love the Daily Show. Otherwise, I would not have heard that at a rally where VP Dick Chaney was speaking urlLink  attendees were required to sign an oath of allegience to the president . The best part is that the oath includes this line: "I, (full name) ... do herby (sic) endorse George W. Bush for reelection of the United States." What exactly does "reelection of the United States" mean? And isn't it "re-election?" And, anyway, why do you want to waste your time speaking to people who already agree with you? Aren't you shooting for the undecideds? Crazy Republicans.

      Smart Cars were in my dream last night.  I may or may not have been discussing their merits on the Today Show. All I know is, Katie Couric said, "Why would you want one of those stupid cars when you can just buy an  SUV." And I said, "Because some of us love this beautiful planet, Katie." Why would I say that? I don't even recycle.

      So, yesterday Luke, Jr. and I were joyfully reunited. It was like Christmas. The most expensive Christmas of my life, but still, Christmas. To celebrate, I ran some errands while listening to the CD I fondly refer to as "Pep Rally." It includes Mizzou fight songs, the alma mater, as well as other tiger-themed music (Eye of the Tiger, Back in Black, etc.). It was created for the ride to Fargo when Rob and I watched MU/ku on tape delay. Anyway, this is all making me very happy. I get in my car to leave the laundromat, and oops, it won't turn over. The battery -- which was just put into my car less than 6 hours before -- is dead. If this doesn't deserve a "Wah, wah," I don't know what does. So, I call my roadside assistance company for the third time in ten days, and they send someone to jump my car. I get home, let the car run for a while, but when I cut it off, it wouldn't start back up again. So, this morning I called the mechanic who sold me the battery, and they come and give me a jump, then I drive back to the mechanic. There they discovered there is a short in my alternator. I'm not happy. However, the mechanic said that since I've had so much done with them lately, he'd put the new one in without charging labor. That's right, I've lived here a month and have a frequent-customer discount with a local mechanic. But, now everything's up and running, and as my dad put it, there really isn't anything left to replace! Whoo hoo!

      A week or so ago I told my mom what I'd had for lunch and supper that day. Neither meal included vegetables. She said, "I didn't hear any vegetables in there! You'd better eat some vegetables! You don't want to get scurvy!" Arrrr! Scurvy.

      White Sox 12, Royals 4. At least we had a valiant effort. You just have to laugh at this point. Laugh to mask the tears.

      Well, Topeka's having a contest to choose a slogan for the city, to celebrate its 150s years of existence. Here are  urlLink three of the suggestions : 1. "Topeka: You won't get a lot of unwanted relatives visiting you." 2. "Topeka -- not as bad as you think!" 3. "City of morons." I hope that No. 3 wins!

      At Andrew's suggestion, I started listening to Launch. Having a Mac at NDSCS, I was unable to do this before, but I had set up my preferred artists. One of them was, of course, Robbie. Then, when a Robbie song played, I clicked on the "If you like this artist, you might like these..." And, I laughed when the Spice Girls were one of the bands. And, then I gave them 4-out-of-4 stars! Now I'm reaping the benifits by listening to Spice Up Your Life. This could be the highlight of my day.

      Apparently those doing the music programming at Virgin Radio believe that Aerosmith's "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" needs to be played. Often. They would be wrong.

      You know that anti-Quin billboard on Hwy. 71 in KC. I hope you all feel better knowing that Kelly shook her fist at it, and Laura made a very angry face at it. Now those hayjocks will think twice before putting up anti-Tiger material!

      I'm two-timing on the Royals. Let's face it, they're abusive. And, as the song says, "If you can't be with the one you love, honey, love the one you're with." And, so I will. Starting sometime last week,  I've adopted the Braves as my baseball mistress. Well, the boy version of a mistress.

      On Friday night - I'm not even kidding - Alan Colmes, the liberal arm of Hannity and Colmes, said to Pat Robertson, "If Jesus were alive today, would he vote Republican?" The funny part, is that while he didn't directly say, "Yes." Pat implied that He would.
