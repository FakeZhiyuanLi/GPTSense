      I finally got myself access to the Internet after a long 6 months.  The first thing that I did was watch the broadcast of the Apple World Developer's Conference 2004 in San Francisco.  There is nothing in this life that makes me giddier than to watch Steve Jobs rip on Windows and then introduce the new Apple products.  My wife took one look at me and rolled her eyes.  She couldn't believe how excited I got when reading up on the fine hardware that is produced by Apple.  Am I a bit overboard?  Yeah... But hey, if you aren't passionate about something,... anything,... you might as well drop out of school and apply for BYU. If you know what I mean.  While I'm sure this Blogger entry is lame, I just thought I would give it a try.  Enjoy it.  PacMan

      I know my blooger is called Apple Crumble and that you would expect all entries to be about Apple Computers and stuff but I've got a lot of other things on my mind right now that I want to write about.  My Dad has cancer.  He has been fighting it for over two years now.  During those years there have been a number of times when my Dad has had extremely close encounters with death.  An interesting thing happens to a person when this occurs so often.  I have become calloused and have a hard time really being scared about his death anymore.  There are even times when I think that his death would be a better scenario than his life.  It is hard to watch someone you love suffer.  There are times when you think you would love to step in and take some of his pain for him.  You would even be willing to take it for a week just to give him at least a week of freedom.  This last week my Dad had yet another brush with death.  He was dehydrated to the point that he started to have serious delusions.  My family was sure this was his last visit to the hospital.  My older brother flew down from Oregon to see my Dad one final time and everything.   Through some of the prayers of our family and some of our close friends, my Dad was able to pull out of his delusions.  The Doctors didn't know what to do for him and didn't know what was causing the delusions.  They admitted this to my mom on a number of occasions.  Eventually they tried to replenish the Potassium in his blood.  Once this happened his mind started to return to normal.  Later that week we talked to my dad's oncologist about the experience.  He says that the low potassum levels would in fact cause hallucinations but not to the degree that my dad experienced.  He also said that he didn't think that raising the potassium levels should have returned my Dad to normal.  He couldn't account for what happened.  Now most people in this world would say that I'm full of crap to be thinking that God had anything to do with my Dad's recovery.  Nonetheless, I still believe that it had everything to do with the prayers that were offered in my Dad's behalf.  I know that my Heavenly Father exists and He is ready to bless our lives whenever we ask of His help in the name of Jesus Christ.  I attend university right now and have been inadvertently called ignorant for believing in the principles of my religion, but I still know that these things are true.  I know by the power of the Holy Ghost.  Comments to this entry are more than welcome.
