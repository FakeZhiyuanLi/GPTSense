My grandpas cancer is gone!    right now--&nbsp; I'm at the point where if something bad could happen then it will. Everyone has those times but its different for everyone...&nbsp; ugh it stinks! but its the kinda thing that if you worry about it too much things will just get worse, but if you dont worry about it then you feel guilty because the other person will think your not concerned?? im so confused! and im sorry if im being mean or if i seem cranky for the next few days and if you have anything that you need help with just ask ill try to help the best I can!&nbsp;&nbsp; sorry and thanks again-tami

       Every moment , a hope of change Feel a cool breeze dance down my spine. For a second, the world can wait Let go and  fly .  Can you hear it calling? Can you feel the song in your soul? Can you trust the wind rush? Can you let it all go? Leap over the part of you that stands and waits You can never be too late.  Forget about those reasons,  (just go out and try)  forget about the rules,  (Let go and  fly )      Every moment , a hope of change Feel a cool breeze dance down my spine. For a second, the world can wait Let go and  fly .   Every moment   (calling)  Feel a cool breeze  (dance in my soul)  The second the world  (feels a rush)  Just let go, let go  (and  fly )
