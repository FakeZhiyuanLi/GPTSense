        apparently he did read the letter after all.&nbsp; and contrary to my prediction, I did manage to get my point across, or at least  a  point across, and it left a mark.&nbsp; from what I understand, he's confused as to why I am angry, other than the fact that "maybe" he should've told me himself....&nbsp; confused?!?&nbsp; what is there to be confused about?&nbsp; didn't I explain myself quite thoroughly and extensively?&nbsp; it's all there in black and white.&nbsp; and yes, damn right he should've told me himself, which is why that&nbsp;point was included in the letter as well.         what I didn't expect out of all this is that the letter ended up in Chef's hands.&nbsp; it was not addressed to him, nor was it about him, and nor was it meant to specifically upset him.&nbsp; but for some reason I guess marc-andre felt the need to pass it along to him nonetheless.&nbsp; and apparently he is choosing to react as though it were directed&nbsp;at him, even though as I've stated, it was not.&nbsp; my understanding is that he's shocked to learn that after approving a letter of reference&nbsp;for me that he neither wrote nor signed, that he would indirectly receive an angry letter from me that was intended for someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;(excuse me while I pace around my mind trying to figure out what the hell the connection is....)&nbsp; so, even though what I wrote had merit and credibility, apparently I'm not allowed to voice my opinion, and he feels that the proper course of action for him to take is to put a stop to my getting the job in florida.&nbsp; does anyone believe that this is supposedly a fully-grown man we're talking about here?         what they initially did to me obviously made me justifiably upset, so I wrote a letter in which I clearly stated how I felt.&nbsp; I was succinct and concise, and I tried my best not to let my anger get the better of me and lead to flying off the handle.&nbsp; and to me, the most important thing about that letter is the fact that it was the truth.&nbsp; and that I had every right to express it.&nbsp; though it may be unprecedented, I consider it to be a formal letter of complaint to a former employer.&nbsp; the way I see it, they run a business and they have to be prepared to deal with receiving complaints, whether it's from customers or from within.&nbsp; but apparently they're not.&nbsp; I don't know, at this point, whether or not he's gone through with sabotaging my plan to work at cafe boulud, but if he has or is still going to, what can I really say but that it's terrifically pathetic.     &nbsp;

        kathleen gave me an assignment for this week - since trying to recall my 3 earliest childhood memories just wasn't working out for me, she decided we'd try a little dream analysis. this past sunday morning I awoke from a beautiful dream that I would give anything in the world to have come true. so here it is, complete with pictures of the actual real-life John Mayer concert I went to later that very same night:       I dreamed that I went to the John Mayer concert and the seat that I’d gotten turned out to be a lot closer to the stage than I’d thought it would be. and though I’d gotten there on time, he was already in the middle of a song. but for some reason it didn’t look like him in the dream, but I just knew it was. and rather than him being on a stage, he was just playing behind a fence that was between him and the front row. the sun was setting so everything looked kind of orangy. then people started leaving and I asked someone in the front row if I could move up there and they said yeah. so there I was in the front row, and I was ecstatic. at one point he was singing a song and he walked through the audience and walked behind my row, and he put his hand on my head as he passed me.       then somehow I found myself walking through a really big old house with him and I felt this frantic urge to get him to sign something for me before it was too late, but it was all so unexpected so I wasn’t prepared with anything for him to sign. but then I thought to myself that really, “I’m walking through a house with John Mayer; I’m never going to be this close to him again in my life; just consider myself lucky already.” (by this time in the dream he looked like himself again.) I was babbling to him about how unreal it was that I hadn’t even planned on attending the concert until that morning, yet now here I was standing right next to him. and at first I thought he was gonna go back to the concert, but then it seemed that the concert was done, and somehow our being together had inadvertently turned into a date. at one point I was looking out a window and three other girls walked past me, seeming to be a little fed up with the fact that he had spent all this time only paying attention to me and they’d decided to leave. they were at the door, I was still at the window, and John was across the room from all of us, and he kinda just said, “k, bye” to them, like he didn’t care. one of the girls was exasperated and said, “god, aren’t you even gonna walk us out?” so he grudgingly obliged. after that we were free to be by ourselves and we were both just so relaxed. I started asking him questions about his songs, and then we ended up laying on a couch together and I asked him if he remembered playing here in vancouver on valentine’s day, and he said, “yeah, and then I came home and no one was there...” and I laughed and said, “well then you should’ve met me back then.” and I teased him about being disappointed that in that concert he hadn’t played either of my two favourite songs. he asked me which they were and I told him, and he smiled to himself as if I’d made the right choices. then I remembered how short this concert had been, and that he’d already been in the middle of a song when I’d arrived, even though I’d been on time, so I asked him to name the songs he’d started playing from start to finish, to figure out how much of the concert I’d missed. I think he’d gotten to naming about 5 songs, and then I woke up. I remember thinking that another reason I’d wanted to know which songs I’d missed was to see if he’d played my favourite song this time or not, and that if he hadn’t, the one thing I wanted most out of this date before it ended, was for him to pick up his acoustic guitar and sing it just for me, and that it would be something I would keep with me forever and never forget.       * on an interesting side note, I really did end up sitting a hell of a lot closer to the stage at the actual concert than I'd expected to.  fifth row, center . and towards the end of the show a few people in the row in front of me did leave (idiots), so I happily repositioned myself accordingly :)   needless to say, it was a precious, beautiful evening.

        what can I say but that&nbsp;I find what you did today disgusting. besides carrying the title of Chef de Cuisine of Lumiere Restaurant, you're not fulfilling that role in much of any impressive way. you're not owning your position. to do so would require you to refrain from playing favourites, or at the very least tone it down and keep it to yourself as much as possible for the benefit of the staff and the restaurant as a whole. it would also require better communication on your part and more initiative to resolve problems, large  and  small, whether you want to or not, because ultimately, though there are so many problems on a day-to-day basis and you're only one person, you're still  the  person. dealing with all the restaurant's bullshit is what your&nbsp;job entails. and you were the one who decided to take it on, so you have no one else to blame but yourself.   on a more first-hand experience with which to base my current opinion of you, I can honestly say that you take advantage of people. when I intended on giving one month's notice starting in mid-april, you asked me to stay until the beginning of june, and even though it was the last thing in the world that I wanted to do, what did I say? I said yes. and when we started negotiating whether I might stay even longer based on the trip to new york, and I asked you to give me a straight up answer as soon as you could so that I could make preparations to look for another job if necessary, what did you do? you dragged it out for weeks, and as a result, I missed an opportunity to secure a position elsewhere that would have otherwise been available to me had I pursued it sooner. so in the end I finalized a date on which I would conclude my employment at Lumiere - July 15th, and I  confirmed  that date with both you and wayne, and we came to an agreement.   what is the date today? it is Saturday, July 10th, and not only was I informed today that my presence as an employee is no longer necessary, you could not even have been bothered to do your own job and inform me of that yourself. the fact is, not having to work my last 3 scheduled shifts doesn't bother me in the slightest. what does bother me, and is highly disturbing to me, is that I've given Lumiere the last year of my life and in return I am not even afforded the courtesy of being able to leave with a smile on my face and a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in my heart. that is what my last 3 days at Lumiere were meant for. to offer the last of my services, to enjoy my last moments of being part of that team, and more important than anything else, to say goodbye to my friends. and in the grand scheme of business management, I can admit that what's important to me doesn't really matter to you, but that's not the point. whether it's business or not, these people have been with me day in and day out for an entire year, and have inevitably become my friends and my life. the eventual recognition of that fact is what will keep your staff healthy and your team intact. you need to open your eyes and realize that this career, unlike any other, is all-consuming to its participants, and you can't treat them like such shit the way you presently do. you took away my farewell to this chapter of my life in the blink of an eye. it makes it extremely hard not to wonder why the hell I even bothered to work there in the first place. it takes away any and all possibilities of why any of it was worth it at all. to put it simply, you make me sick.   sincerely,   Mona

           hey out there. it's so late at night and I'm so tired, but... you know, it's just been one of those nights, those days, those few days, where things just aren't right and you're just so... fucking fed up with the not-rightness of it all that you have to write something down or scream out loud or sing at the top of your lungs just to get this shit out.   wow, that was a long sentence. so what's with these last few days, you ask? I've been waiting. living my day-to-day life and coming home and sitting patiently at this computer of mine. waiting for an answer to a question. and as each night passes into the next day without resolution, I hate to think that maybe my answer is being given to me in a way I'm going to be forced to accept, regardless of whether I like it or not. regardless of whether I deserve better or not.   to put it simply, well... maybe there really is no simple way, is there? *sigh* I've put myself in a situation I should be staying away from. the bizarre thing about it all is that no one's doing this to me but me. I let myself become endeared to someone who is unwilling to reciprocate. and you know, I knew this fact quite early on and I could've simply left well enough alone and left it all behind me. but a naive part of me thought that maybe I could leave the door open just a crack, just enough to say hi every now and then and keep some semblance of communication intact. I honestly thought that's all it would be. but then  HE  opened the door wider. I considered it a pleasant surprise, and though I'm smart enough to know I've now successfully entered pretty dangerous territory, I'm just not one to resist temptation. so I've walked through the door and now I don't know where I am, or where I stand. because all of a sudden he's not on the other side.   so, back to what I mentioned earlier, a question I posed to him continues to go unanswered. it's 3:13 a.m. and life is... unsatisfactory, to say the least. I'm tired; tired of sleepless nights, tired of love-song-and-chocolate-bar therapy, tired of needing to type these words out just to appease all my unrest, tired of everyone and everything turning out to be such a disappointment, tired of so... much... bullshit.   all I want is an answer.

        the following piece of writing has been revised and transferred here after having originally been handwritten last night, away from home:        sunday, august 1    approximately 2:41 a.m.        I'm at may's house tonight, spending the night because the "gang's" plans ran a little late. it was a fun evening, though what we ended up doing was completely different than what had originally been planned. instead of watching the fireworks and going to a club, we went to chapters and then grabbed a bite to eat. we rented a movie and decided to make it another late-night sleep over. the movie, although slightly adolescent, was entertaining enough, especially in conjunction with some of may's homemade chai tea and a couple healthy rounds of competitive Crazy 8's. nobody else is as much of a night owl as I am, though, understandably, so bedtime came as soon as the movie had ended.        that was somewhere close to an hour ago. I lay there in the darkness staring up at the ceiliing and I may as well have just drank 5 shots of espresso. there's something weird about not sleeping at home, or maybe it's more like I was just weirding myself out about feeling alone even when surrounded by 3 other people. yeah, I think that's more what it was. a nice dose of that queasy anxiety was rolling around my insides, and it manifested itself into a bit of a crying session. at times like those, I always start thinking to myself, "see, kathleen?!? this is not normal behaviour and I have no idea how it's ever gonna stop." I started snowballing into that all-too-familiar train of thought about how I resent my mom so much for not... fucking raising me better. for leaving me alone as a child, not so much physically (though that did occur as well), but metaphorically. after having looked at those baby pictures the other day that I hadn't seen in forever, it almost makes my disappointment in myself even worse. I was such a beautiful little child, and my life shouldn't have led me to this cold, dark balcony in the middle of the night, straining my eyes to see what the hell I'm writing, simply to keep myself from going mad.        my mom was supposed to be my most forceful and reliable source of discipline. instead she just assumed that I was smart enough never to need any help with my homework, which was true, but so what? she was supposed to try helping me anyway. she never nurtured me, never encouraged or helped me to explore what ever natural talents I may have had and shown growing up. she didn't instill any appreciation in me for music or art or the importance of physical extracurricular activites. she always just assumed too much, in the end assuming that I was a bright enough little girl to just end up perfect, or at least normal, all by myself. but you know what? I  didn't . somewhere along the line I got fucked up and I let so many things escape me and she didn't do anything to stop it.        any of the good things about me that make up who I am right now, I acquired and developed on my own. it's almost as though she can't take credit for anything about me but getting herself pregnant.
