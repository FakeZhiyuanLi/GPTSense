      I was in Pier One last week, cuz on Sunday you can't buy alchohol till 1 and I found myself in the check out isle of Wild Oats at 12:30 with a bottle of wine.  So anyway, there I was, listening to this yukalayle (?) remake of Somewhere over the Rainbow.  Two memories came to mind.  When I was about 5 or 6, my mom, hoping that I would grow up to be a singer, taught me this song and I performed it in front of my sisters' piano music theory class.  I sang it with all the passion I could have mustered were I singing a hymn at a revival.  For all I knew, it could have been a hymn.    The second memory was from this past Spring.  I was in New York at the Whitney Bienniel.  People are making things again; when I called one of my teachers from Nashville several months before, frustrated because painting was "out" along with object making in general (in favor of conceptual work that pushed artistic boundaries---fusing with philosopy, socialogy, politics etc...which I think is extremely interesting stuff--but I like to paint and make objects also...)  She comforted me by telling me that these kinds of things come in waves and there will be times when the future looks scary or bleak or uncertain and artists will turn again to business of making things.  This seemed to be the case in much of the work at the Whitney.  Two years ago I heard that the work was largely conceptual, political and confrontational.  This show had some political underpinnings, but seemed to be way more subtile.  I heard a guide talking about references to the dark ages particularly with it's apocalyptic imagery, many peices seemed to be about consummer culture with all it's sensory inundation and hypnotic effects.  The one peice that made the biggest impression on me was an object that ran along the staircase of the museum.  The core of it was centralized in one space, this silver metallic and clear plastic, futuristic-looking time capsule with mirrors forming a conical shape in it's center where you could see the distorted image of your face. There was music coming from the core.  A cacophany of several voices singing and reciting the words to "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," each one at a different place in the score. Branching off from this core were clear plastic tubes with colored wire inside ending at various points along the stair case.  As you walked away from the core, you left the dissonant, chaotic voices but were beckoned by these clear cones at the end of this machine's tubed arms.  With your ear to the cone, you could hear the voice of an individual, not a singer, but an ordinary voice, sometimes frail, sometimes off key.  Putting your ear to cone after cone, you communed with all sorts of voices, in their own way, rendering "Somewhere over the rainbow."  Listening to all those anonyomous absent people sing through their frailty this song about escape and relief ("If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow Why, oh why can't I?") seemed sobering to say the least.  With the piece lining the steps of the gallary, thus accompanying me as I traveled from floor to floor, I felt like these people's hopes were following me, haunting me, reminding me of my own.  And with the vulnurability of the sentiment, I thought of all those that were likely to not be fufilled....the ache that if I were to fully enterain these hopes there would not be room enough in this life (to say the least), room enough in this whole world to fufill them.  The feeling is similiar to the one I've been having as I ride the bus and look into people's faces who obviously aren't "there" and wonder if they know where they are, if they're just shutting down, getting away, if this is the only time in  the day when their thoughts can be their own. I often wonder at the fact that we all sit so damn close to each other on those rush hour buses, but at the same time are completely alone in our interior worlds, like the voices in those tubes.  Are these hopes that completely surpass the possibilities of this life simply a narcotic?  Are all these things that offer momentary relief, communion, invigoration, passion, joy, amazement hints (foretastes) of something deeper?  Are the addictions that we all share in some form just premature escapes, premature attempts at bliss? There have been moments when I have been willing to bet my life on those last sentences.  Right now, right this second, I feel the hollowness of not knowing.  Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high, There's a land that I heard of Once in a lullaby.   Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue, And the dreams that you dare to dream Really do come true.  Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds are far Behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me.  Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh why can't I?  If happy little bluebirds fly Beyond the rainbow Why, oh why can't I?

      So here I am, learning from all the cool bloggers in my life the beauties of sending my thoughts, ideas, questions, ramblings out into cyberspace for anyone to peruse.  Is there a spell check on this thing?  Ah man, this could get embarracing...cuz I know people are just chomping at the bit to read my thoughts, ideas, questions, ramblings and will probibly also have to endure my pretty horrendous spelling.  I remember Heidi Helm telling me about his book she was reading that said that an artist's first great obsticle is to heal past the fact that they can't spell.  I think that's a pretty crazy generalization...but it fits me.  I would study for hours for those crazy bees and without fail, first word, I'm out. So why am I blogging now (you ask)?  (Gosh, this conversation reminds me of those I would have with my imaginary friend as a child...Brair Fox, lived in the tree next to our house)  WELL, I'll tell you why!  Lately my mind's been spinning in such a topsy turvy mannor that I'm afraid at any second it's gonna fall off whatever is holding it up (maybe that's a good thing?)  I've been reading like my life depends on it, I've been in this crazy solumn, pensive state of mind that I fear if I were to really try to hash out these ponderings with a real live human being I might devour them.  And I love my friends, but not for dinner. So that's part of it.  When this becomes too much, you just close the little window on your computer...all better.  Another motivating factor is the hopes of sorting through this mess of thoughts and the anxiety that seems to be driving them right now.  Maybe someone out there will understand, maybe they will tell me their story.  for many years I have done all my sorting in journals, mostly in prayer form or these crazy mind maps that tend to get me to the crux of the issue a bit faster than stream of consciousness writing (dang my nonlinear mind).  My prayers lately have been more interspersed throughout the day and shorter, "God, please give me faith, I have none" etc...I hope this isn't my replacement for prayer, because I'm lugging a big fat ass mountain of doubt behind me right now.   Despite all that, I think Ill start with some testimony time (preach on).  So I've been reading Nietzche's "On the Genealogy of Morals."  Not the reason for my struggles now, that would take a great deal more explaining.  I guess I am reading him so as not to feel like there may be this big intellectual boggie man under a rock that will make my faith crumble if I ever were to pier beneath it--also just cuz I'm curious and love ideas and want to know more about this person that is "the father of postmodernism"--according to somebody I read somewhere.  His narrative about the origins of Christianity has been challenging, to say the least.  When I first read his essay on good and evil, my heart sank.  I've heard so many critiques on Christianity based on the aweful things Christians have done...no refutations here..the crusades, the witch trials, segregated churches, sexism in the name of God, etc....definately some skeletons there, all of which clumped together amount to just about the antithesis of the crazy sacrificial love that Jesus lived and died.  That's the story I've fallen in love with, not those of my "forefathers of the faith."  Nietzche attacks that story...faith, hope, love--attacked...frutis of the spirit "patience, kindness, gentleness..."--same.  He talks about slave resentment and "spiritual" revolt, religion as a narcotic and excuse for impotence and a means to denial of unbearable meaninglessness.  I think what makes it sting so much is the elements of truth in some of his words..like the narcotic bit.  I've seen religion used as a narcotic...I've done it (I'm afraid of people, so I think Ill stay in my room and read the bible, I can't make a decision so I'll pray till the opportunity passes or something just happens).  I've used it as a tactic of resentment and revenge...I've used it as some kind of spiritual euphamism for the unexplainable horrendous tragedies with which most people have to live and by which some people are crushed.  But I can't get past this sacrificial love bit.  It doesn't fit in a pure survival of the fittest world. (and no, I'm not saying that because I need to read the bible literally, I don't know how to read the bible...)  I don't buy that it's all about resentment.  There's alot to talk about there, which I won't go into now but, I guess the main reason why I can't give up this particular kind of love is the kind of self-forgetful yet self-affirming joy I've tasted receiving and giving that love (the giving side still so clumsy and way too rare) AND the utter hell I have felt when I am fixated only my own needs, desires, dreams and am crazy desprit to see them actualized.  So, anyway, all that to say, last Saturday night I was stringing these paper flowers (tons of um) that some women in our community made for Juli and Dave's wedding on Sunday.  I stayed up late doing it.  It was the first thing I have done in a while out of love (regretfully, this whirlwind of thoughts has led me to implode, I think I'm still supposed to be sorting---just not in my little selfish vaccuum)  Granted, this kind of love is easy.  Not only do I dearly love Dave and Juli, Juli has cared for me as a friend in crazy, amazing Jesus like ways.  She asks questions that convince me it's safe to answer honestly, she remembers my story, my struggles and treads gently but somehow can lure me out of my hiding places to courage with her words, she's stayed up until god aweful hours of the morning with me helping me fix the various artistic binds I've gotten myself into.  I was thinking of these things as I was stringing these flowers.  I asked the God who put such crazy love into my friend and who spun all this sacrificial love into being, to accept the stringing of those paper flowers as worship.  Do I know what to do with the Bible?--nope, what about all the forms of Christianity that makes me hyperventilate?--huh, what about the idea of hell?--no answers here....but I know I can never let go of this love and if my life ends up being about anything else, it's not worth it.  I've had glimpses of peace in this place, that it's ok to know nothing right now accept that one basic thing...stringing those flowers, drinking magarrita's with Elian, sitting on the front porch laughing with Brooklin, Quanicia and Risa from the hood.  Damn, it feels good to laugh.  Hoping more times like these are forth coming...
