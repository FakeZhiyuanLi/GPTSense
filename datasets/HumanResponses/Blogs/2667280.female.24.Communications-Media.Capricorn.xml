      is it just me or are most famous people really weird? I watched part of the Golden Globes last night...mostly because it was the only thing on the only channel i get, and less out of actual interest for it...and it seems to me that movie and television stars are mostly just...weird. Yes, some have pretty much built their careers around said weirdness...ie: Jack Nicholson and Jim Carrey, who are at least amusingly weird sometimes...but others just make me wonder. What makes some of them wear what they wear? Seriously! Mary Louise Parker's boobs were literally FALLING out of her dress. And yes...she does have nice boobs...I'll happily give her that...but why let them just fall out of a dress like that? Why not devise some sort of creative support garment that does something interesting to said nice boobs, like push them up where they're supposed to be or something. Just a thought.   Then there are people like Nicole Kidman. She seems pretty normal on the surface, but then there were these candid shots of her during peoples' speeches and stuff, and she just sat there with eyes glazed over and mouth agape. And I mean AGAPE. Not just a little slack-jawed with disinterest...we're talking yawn-proportions. She honestly looked drugged, and not in a happy slightly high yay i'm at the golden globes way. She looked medicated.   The whole show actually seemed to be fairly devoid of Robbins-Sarandon-esque random political spewings, which was refreshing...though I did appreciate someone's quip during an acceptance speech about how the two biggest problems facing our country right now probably are NOT steroid use in the sports world and gay marriage. That was paraphrased, just so you don't come back and yell at me later...and I believe it was Meryl Streep who said it, but I was in the other room at the time so I won't put money on that.   From Al Pacino's disoriented acceptance speech to Sofia Coppola getting the Best Director award and having to have someone coach her on people to thank (and her really creepy cleft-palate type lisp...what's up with that? She has more money than God...can't she get that fixed?!)...it was an hour and some that certainly could have been spent doing something more productive. ;)

      phone rings at 8.15am. It's my father, whom I love dearly, but who tends to have quite an abrupt manner on the phone.  "Are you up?" he asks as I'm wiping the drool from my chin and trying to open my eyes. "No...why?" I sound half dead...even to me.  "Got a load of wood headed your way. Just left Hartland...he'll be there in less than an hour. Gotta move your car and get the porch ready so we can stack it."   Oh...lovely.  "Mmmmkay...lemme jus' get dresshed 'n stuff..." The one eye I managed to pry open is already fluttering closed again. "Ok....don't go back to sleep. And dress warm...it's about 10 below."   *click*  No chance of getting back to sleep after that. 10 below?! WHAT THE?! Who in their right mind stacks a cord of wood at 9am on a sunday morning...WHEN IT'S 10 BELOW ZERO?!   Well, ma'am...that'd be yours truly. See...it'd be one thing if the wood was my dad's and I was just doing him a favor by helping him stack it. That'd be grounds for rolling over and going back to sleep. But no...this is my wood. This wood keeps my pipes from freezing. The guy bringing the wood spent all day in the below-zero frigidness cutting this wood yesterday so that I could have it and keep my little tootsies warm all winter long. So I roll my ass outta the down-comforter-flannel-sheeted-bliss that is my bed, and stumble downstairs to get dressed...by the wood stove...that's filled with wood from the LAST time Brent The Wood Guy was here...not even a month ago.   Two pairs of socks, jeans, thermal shirt, regular shirt, fleece vest, boots, jacket and gloves later, I'm good to go. Not awake...but good enough to stack wood.   On the porch, there's a little bit...ok a lot...of a wind-break, because there's a couple big willow trees about 20 yards across the way, and there's the tarp that my dad and I stapled up along the inside of the north wall of the porch. The sun's out...it's a gorgeous late-january day of the type you can only find in northern New England. Then I step off the porch and out past the lilac bush, which also acts as wind-break. The north wind literally howls down from the ledges and chugs along about 1/2 a mile of pasture like a freight train before it wraps around anything in its path...including me, my dad, and Brent, unloading wood from the back of Brent's beat-up ton-truck. Quite a way to wake up.   I don't think I've ever seen three people put away a cord of wood so fast in my life. It was so cold that we had to keep taking turns going inside to thaw briefly before continuing. Even my dad, who is pretty much the definition of New England-style hardy...(he's 6 feet tall, has legs like tree trunks...the guy could probably lift a friggin' car up by the front bumper if he thought he needed to)...was ducking inside to hold his hands over the wood stove every now and then. I only went in once, but I was being stupid - I should have known better. I waited until I literally couldn't feel my ears (or my ass, for that matter) before I went in, and was rewarded later on with an itching, burning sensation on my ear lobes for a good hour or so. Frostbite, anyone?!   Anyway...we got the wood all stacked, and we did it turbo-style...and I'll be able to keep warm for another month or so, which is nice. As I watched my dad and his buddy chucking wood and laughing, shooting the breeze while they were freezing their asses off, I thought to myself... they don't have to be here doing this. they probably wanted to sleep in on a sunday morning, too.   Yeah...Brent's getting paid for the wood, but come on...would I have gone out into the freezing cold for $100? No sir. And what about my dad? He didn't get anything out of it, except probably a stiff back tomorrow.   I know that neither one of them is probably ever going to read this (they're SO not the internet type)...but this is about as public of a thank-you as I can manage.   So even though I already thanked you over and over this morning while you were both driving away...I have to thank you once more for giving up a part of your sunday morning that you could have been spending in your warm houses, doing any number of things more enjoyable than stacking wood.   I owe you one.

      Instead of writing one big long post about one particular thing that's got me wound up, I'm making a list of several things that just generally piss me off....just for fun! Please note that this list is not necessarily in order...I'm just typing them frantically as they come to me. Onward!    1) Being called kiddo by anyone other than my grandfather.    Just don't do it. It's not going to endear your geriatric ass to me at all, whatsoever. It's only going to make me raise my eyebrow and look at you like you're...well...and old fart. Because you are. So lay off.    2) Perpetually cheery people.  I am capable of cheer. I often have good moods. I have, on occassion, been refered to as friendly, congenial, charming, and even once...*gasp*...perky. However, just like when consuming alcohol, I know my limit. Some people...do not. Come on, now...everyone has bad days. It happens. People get down and depressed about stuff...so don't sit there and strain your freakin' larynx trying to sound up-beat when what you really want is to wolf down a pint of Ben and Jerry's and cry yourself to sleep. We've all been there...there's no need for pride.    3) Procedures with no logic behind them.  If you are not prepared to tell me WHY something is done the way it is, and give me adequate back-story to support said reasoning, then don't expect me to want to do it your way, especially if your way SUCKS. If your way is a pain in the ass, and my way is un-painful and yeilds the EXACT same result, you best be splainin' to me a DAMN good reason why I can't just do it my way. And even then...it's prolly best not to expect me to like it and/or comply.    4) Busybody types who wish so bad that they were in charge that they will do anything, and I do mean ANYTHING, to kiss a supervisor's ass in an attempt to further themselves with the company.   'Nuff said.    5) My crooked teeth  I know, random...right? Yes. But here's the deal. My bottom left canine tooth (you know, the fangy looking ones) is turned just a little bit...just enough so that the corner of the tooth pokes just a tiny bit past the surface of the rest of my bottom teeth. I don't think you could even see it unless I could unhinge my jaw for you or something...but it drives me BONKERS. That little tiny bit of tooth rubs against the inside of my bottom lip and makes it feel like my teeth are 20 times more messed up than they are. I catch myself doing weird lip motions sometimes, just trying to make it so that I can't feel it anymore, but it never works. And yes, it's been like that since my adult teeth grew in...so it's been a good 12-15 years, probably...and I'm still not used to it. I want very much to just take a file and scuff that little edge off and be done with it, but I'm pretty sure that would involve a whole lotta pain and I'm not down with that.    6) Old people who are hard of hearing, but they pretend that they're not, because they don't want to admit to themselves that they are.  (And no, this is not directed toward my grandmother, although Nana WOULD very much benefit from a hearing aid. SOON.) This stems from a phone call that I got at work today. An elderly lady called in because her furnace was not working, and it's like -20 degrees out. That's all well and good. Where the trouble started was when I answered the phone and she yelled "HELLO?!" and I said "Hello!" and she yelled "HELLO?!?" and I yelled back "HEEELLLLOOOO!!!" and she yelled "IS...IS THERE ANYBODY THERE? MY FURNACE IS BROKEN AND I'M COLD! HELLO?!". So I did what I had to do...I yelled at the top of my lungs. "MA'AM....I CAN HEAR YOU...CAN YOU HEAR ME?!" "YES...I CAN HEAR YOU NOW!!" (and she's all the while still yelling at the top of HER lungs, mind you) "OK, MA'AM...WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM?" "THE WHAT?" "THE PROBLEM MA'AM...WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR FURNACE?" "WELL I DON'T KNOW...I'M NOT AN OIL TECHNICIAN!!!" Props on that one, Granny. Anyway...you get my drift. It went on...and on...and on. It was like pulling teeth, trying to get this woman to give me the information I needed to send a tech out to work on her furnace. And then, after 15 minutes (not exaggerating) of yelling back and forth with her, I ask if she's going to be home to let the tech in when he gets there. "HOW WILL I KNOW HIM?!" she says. Geeee...the big truck with the oil company's name emblazoned on the side in red and orange letters about 3 feet high might tip ME off...that, or the uniform, name tag, and tool box...but one can never be too careful, I guess....

      So...I bought a bag of sugar last Tuesday and brought it in to work because we were out, and because I just can’t tolerate unsweetened, un-cut-with-milk coffee. Anyway...so what's a standard bag of sugar? Like 5 lbs, right? Right. There's two other ladies that drink coffee here, too...and I'm down with that. I know that one of them drinks it black...the other one drinks it with sugar but no milk (which is possibly the most repugnant food combination to have been created since someone put together liver and onions, in my opinion, but I digress).  Now I'm about to do a little math, so stick with me here. We're going to take the worst-case scenario...that's me drinking two cups of coffee in a morning (which happens…but it’s rare). In each cup of coffee, I have one and a half teaspoons of sugar...so 1.5 X 2 = 3. Still with me? Good. So I, myself, the procurer of the aforementioned 5 POUND bag of sugar, consume 3 teaspoons of said sugar a day, at most. During a 5-day work week, that's 15 teaspoons of sugar, total. What percentage of 5 lbs is 15 teaspoons? That's hard to figure out without busting out the scales and weighing things, because we're going by weight, not volume. Either way, I think  you see where I’m going with this. The 5 lb bag of sugar has been here all of a week…and there’s less than half a cup left. 15 teaspoons of sugar a week does not an entire bag of sugar make! So where the hell is the rest of the sugar going? Does that woman REALLY take THAT much sugar in her coffee every day? And if so, why is she not like, twitching on the floor in shock right now due to extreme sugar overload?  Please don’t get me wrong. I have no problem with kicking in a couple bucks to buy a bag of sugar or a container of milk, or even some coffee once in a while so that we can all enjoy it and be happier, more sane people…but a 5 POUND BAG OF SUGAR A WEEK?! Something’s gotta give. As bad as it sounds, I tried bringing in my own little private stash of sugar in a little zip-lock bag…but not only did I feel like a coke fiend just toting it around, but my stash was eventually found and silently done away with as well! Umm, HELLO?! Ask first? Thanks.   So anyway…that’s my sugar predicament. I can’t go without the sugar in my coffee, so I can’t just let the supply run out and wait for someone else to replenish it…and I sure as HELL can’t go without coffee in the morning…but I don’t think that I should have to be providing the apparent drug of choice for a co-worker, either. I mean, come on…is she snorting it? Cooking it up and shooting it? SMOKING IT?! What can one possible DO with that much sugar in one freaking week, other than spoon it directly from bag to mouth…which makes me twitch with horror just to contemplate. Maybe she’s taking it home and baking cookies with it or something, you say…to which I would reply: A) I think not. If you knew her, you’d think not too…and B) If she IS…then she needs to either bring me some of those damn cookies, or better yet, BUY HER OWN DAMN SUGAR!!!

      Sometimes I think that ambition can be a sickness.  Ok, that's not quite right...let me re-phrase that. Sometimes I think that ambition with no outlet to apply it to can be a sickness...just like anything else that builds up inside with no way to express or vent it.   I come to this opinion after having a discussion with a friend online about art. He had a picture up on his site that looked a lot like something I had seen a dear friend draw, years and years ago. Spurred by recollections of my friend from high school, I got myself onto Google and put his name in to see what I could find about him. There were several articles about him from some newsletter through the university he went to, and I read everything I could find. He was always quite a character. I haven't seen him in a good 3 years, probably...maybe more. Anyway...he's been quite successful, and I happily read about different shows that he'd been in, and good things other people had to say about him, etc. When there were no more articles to read, I sort of just sat here thinking, (I know, I know...that's where I went wrong...you don't have to tell me twice), and became more and more disgruntled with myself.   Why is it, I wonder, that some people have such fantastic talent for some things, while other people are born with no talent at all? And more importantly, why am I so obsessed with wanting to be famous? Wanting to be known for something? Do I really want attention that badly? I've always been what I deemed to be a very self-sufficient, well-adjusted person. What is this drive that I have to do something...ANYTHING...that I will later be known for? And then there's the frustration of the fact that while I'm certainly moderately good at some things, I've never really excelled at anything...not to the point where I might possibly be famous for it. So I'm left with this ambition...this burning desire to do something...and do it to a grand scale...but nothing to exact said ambition upon. It just sort of builds up and bubbles over and I find myself being jealous of my friends' accomplishments...which in turn makes me feel like a bad person...  Heh...this started out as a post and ended up as a therapy session, I guess. Maybe I should go back to school and become a psychiatrist...;)

      too brain-dead to actually post anything moderately intelligent at the moment, so i'm just making a list. Deal.   Currently listening to: Stevie Ray Vaughn - Greatest Hits  drinking: water  working on: writing up "dummy" invoices for jobs, so that my incompetant boss can bill them out so that i can write up the "real" invoice later on. Yes, that's right...I make up an invoice twice for the same fucking thing. Every job. Don't get me started.   thinking about: a) how fucking cold it is and how this is not right. It's just not. It's very wrong. b) see above re: incompetant boss. c) Maybe I'm spelling incompetant wrong. Fucked if I care at the moment. d) I want a nap. e) if I was the boss, I wouldn't be incom...incomp...inc...USELESS!! I wouldn't be useless! but then again, I wouldn't have time to do this, either...heh. f) "if the house is a-rockin'...don't bother knockin'..." g) how many letters I can go for on here before I get sick of doing it and/or you get sick of reading it. h) yep...that's about it, right there.   addendum to thinking about: Am I really that white? I mean...I just made a joke to Alex a little while ago about saurkraut (again, spelled wrong, I'm sure), and he wrote back "it's official...you're white..." and then there was a bunch more to the joke that i"m too lazy to write down right now...but my point...if I had a point...might be this: Am I really so obviously white? I mean...Alex knows I'm white...because I told him...and because he's seen a picture of me...but if he DIDN'T know that I was white, would it still really be that painfully obvious, just by the way I do things? I don't think that I like the idea of that. And then again, does it really matter? I mean...I was raised to believe that skin color doesn't matter...everyone's born with a certain amount of potential, regardless of where they came from or how they were brought up...so if it doesn't matter to ME if someone is black/white/purple/otherwise pigmented, should it matter to anyone what color I am? I don't think it should, personally. But that's just me. I know that it doesn't matter to friends I have who happen to be black/hispanic/whatever...I'm not even really sure how I got off on this tangent, or why I was even thinking about it, quite honestly.   Ok...I think I just needed a brain-douche like that before I go back to my completely pointless afternoon of busy-work. My head feels all spring-breeze-fresh again...or something...hehehe

      There is nothing...and I truly mean nothing...that I hate worse than being interrupted by something work-related on my lunch break. I am required to punch out for my lunch break. That means I am not getting paid for that half hour of my time here. Why the HELL does someone think they can come and bug me about stuff that I certainly don't even give a shit about to BEGIN with? HELLO!! When I'm not getting PAID to give a shit about it, it's certainly NOT going to increase the chances that I'm going to be interested in helping you out with it. And for the record, yes...I WOULD leave during my lunch so that I couldn't be bugged by these people if it wasn't minus 17 bazillion degrees out!!! I'm trapped...TRAPPED, I tell you. Trapped like a poor nervous furry animal ready to gnaw their own leg off in an attempt at freedom. I shit you not...my left leg is looking DAMN tasty about now...hmph.

      Hmmm...ok, here goes. Write about life, hold nose, push "post"...nothing to lose, right? Right...   So here I am, staring at this blank page and something that seemed like such a cool and easy idea a little while ago has suddenly become sort of intimidating. I guess I should start with a little bit about myself, so anyone happening upon this will be able to have a bit of background. My name's Shelby...nice to meet you. I live in a rural part of the north-eastern United States. I'm 24 years old, I went to college for a year before they caught on and kicked me out (heh) and now I'm unhappily ensconced in the "real world" joys of rent, car payments, second jobs, and the un-stunning realization that...hey...I have no fucking clue what I want to do with my life. Whoops...dropped an F-bomb already...this can't be good...but then again, who's gonna stop me, right? Damn, the internet's a beautiful place...heh heh.   Anyway...so that's about it for now, I guess. Hopefully if you're bothering to read this to begin with, then you'll be able to bear with me the first few times I do this until I get used to it. If not...then screw ya! ;)

      I'm a complete and utter TOOL, and I'll tell you why.   I'm here at work on a Saturday (my regular job...I didn't have to work at my weekend job this...err...weekend. Anyway...) because we're backed up with stuff that's gotta get out monday and tuesday. So I came in to help Pam out. Pam left at noon, and I turned the radio on when she left. I've been being good and doing my work for the most part, but the radio station that I'm listening to just played three REALLY good songs in a row, the last one being "Hot Blooded" by...erm...I think it's Foreigner. Anyway, I was dancing around, singing at the top of my lungs, and just generally being idiotic whilst shaking my ass around the production room. I suddenly had that funny "someone is watching me" feeling, and I looked up...sure enough, there's some creepy guy standing there at the front door, looking in, laughing at me!! It's bad enough that the asshole was watching me, but LAUGHING at me? Come on, now...that's harsh. I have a mean Moon Walk...I know this. He should have been clapping!!   Anyway, so I was REALLY embarassed, but what could I do? I went over to the door and unlocked it, and opened it just enough so that he could hear me.   "Can I help you?"  He was wiping his eyes. He had been laughing THAT hard. I wanted to kick him.   "Yeah...I'm supposed to drop something off for Jim...is he here?"  Like I'd tell you, after that!  "Nah...there's no one that works here named Jim. Sorry."  He blinked.   "Ain't this 50 North?"  No, stupid...look at the 16-inch tall numbers on the side of the building.   "Nope...it's 52. You want hospital receiving?"   "Yeah...I got some tools for Jim."  "Well you and your tools need to be up THERE..." I pointed across the lot and up the hill to the HUGE green warehouse with all the trucks around it that had the hospital logo on them.   "S'at 50 North?"  I just looked at him. Did I not just say that, in several different ways? Was he retarded? Did he have an attention span problem? I didn't respond...I just stood there giving him my patented death-look.  "Ok...I'll try up there. Have fun!"  He smirked as he turned to walk away. I was so mad...I slammed the door and locked it and just stood there fuming until he drove away. Then I stomped in here to write it all down...just so EVERYONE can laugh at me about it, not just him. Yes, glutton for punishment...I know, I know...  ...but I'm...HOT BLOODED!! Check it and SEEEEEE!!! HOT BLOODED!! Got a FEVER of 103!!!!!

      I don't know what it is, but I'm all about the leap-year this year. I was SO excited when I realized that we had an extra day this February. I think that Leap Year Weekend should be a nationally recognized holiday. I think it's a PRIMO excuse for one hellacious fucking BASH. Come on...it only happens once every 4 years!! That's a reason, if I ever heard one. Look at the parties we have for things that only happen ONCE a year, for Christsakes...New Years? Halloween? BIG parties. So Leap Year Weekend should be 4 times as big! There should be bonfires...music...FREE DRINKS FOR ALL!! Or...you know, if there's nothing to burn and no one to play music, I'm still cool with the FREE DRINK FOR ALL!! Or even possibly just some HEAVILY DISCOUNTED DRINKS FOR ALL!! And if that's not going to work, then I'm good with heavily discounted drinks for....ME!! MWAAAA-hahahahahaaaa!!  So what are my plans for Leap Year Weekend, you ask? Not a fuckin' thing, I say. I came up with my brilliant LYW plan much too late this year. The upside to that is that I have 4 whole years to plan the next LYW event, so it should be the rager of all time. The bad thing is that I'll be 28 by then. 28!!! Will I still be able to party at 28? Will my hair be falling out and my rheumatoid arthritis crippling me too much to dance on tables? Will I be requesting shots of prune juice with Metamucil chasers?  I think not. This here is a not-so-lean but VERY freakin' mean partying machine, let me tell you. I have downed 5ths of Cuervo with the best of them. I have killed 6-packs, 12-packs, and I once attempted an entire 18-pack, though I will admit to being most certainly worse for the wear before that endeavor came to a close. I have mixed beer and liquor (never sicker? Yes, I've been sicker...see above re: the 18 pack), I have consumed entire 1.5 liter bottles of Pinot Grigio. (You laugh...but try it some time. That shit gets ROUGH. Wine can not be considered a sally drink when consumed in proper quantities). I have sucked down Jello-shots, I have licked salt from my own (and other peoples') skin whilst doing shots of tequila, I have done F-bombs, lemon drops, slippery nipples, suffering bastards, fog-cutters, brain-busters, and any number of other insidious combinations of strange-tasting nectars chugged from shot glasses. I have sat next to a bonfire and cracked open a bottle of peppermint schnapps, drank 3/4 of the bottle over a 1 and a half-hour period, and then not been able to get up, even with assistance. I have been so drunk that I've fallen asleep without knowing it, so drunk that I've woken up not knowing where I am, and so drunk that I've not actually been able to sleep at all. I have been a funny drunk, a sad drunk, an angry drunk, but thankfully never an arrested drunk. I like to think that I only drink for fun, but I know deep down that I sometimes do it just to get away from who and what I am, from where I live, from what I do. I think that this realization in and of itself makes me that much stronger of a person, and much more in control of myself and my actions. The simple recognition of the fact that I am only drinking a bottle of wine because I had a shitty day usually makes me think twice about having the 3rd and 4th glass to finish off the bottle.   It doesn't usually STOP me...but it does give me pause...;)

      The day started out so well...it really did.   The sun was shining...the grass was....well, covered with a couple feet of snow...but the sun was shining, which is a bonus. I was chipper and happy after an excellent night's sleep, a satisfying shower, and a nice big bowl of Cheerios. I got dressed, piled into the Impala, and roared off to work as I sang along to "I Am The Highway" by Audioslave, which was on the radio.   Highway indeed. Harbinger of things to come? We shall see.   I tend to drive fast. 80 is good...my car likes 80. It feels good to let the horses loose every morning and just zip happily along the interstate. Occasionally I push it and do 85 if I'm in a hurry...but most of the time i average between 75-80, and I'm happy with that. So I was toodling along I-91 with the cruise set to 84, minding my own business in the passing lane as I blew by an old rusted-out Toyota, when I noticed what looked disturbingly like the nose of a state trooper's car peeking innocently over the rise ahead of me. "SHIT!!" said I, and tapped the brakes, not wanting to jam them and be totally obvious to said radar-in-waiting. That knocked me back to about 78, but I could tell as I whizzed past the green and gold Crown Vic that it was much too late. There was no flick of lights as if to say "Tag, you're it...". There was no menacing bleat of a siren. He didn't even pull out immediately, as there was a fair amount of morning-rush traffic (many of them probably going JUST as fast, Officer...thank you!) to contend with. I dribbled down to 70 and proceeded with caution, looking furtively in my rear-view every few seconds.   No blue lights!! No sign of the cop!! Had I really just gotten away with this? Had I escaped the jaws of justice once more? Had I lived to spread the words of glory that all speed-demons covet: "...and I got away!!"   'Fraid not, folks. For just as I was beginning to feel almost warm and snuggly with the joy of escape, something dark and ghostly crept into my rearview, and was gaining on me. Quickly. I didn't panic...it would have surely sealed my fate to just give up and pull over immediately when I saw him coming after me. You can't let them think they're in charge, you know. So I rambled on. He came right up behind me and just tagged along for almost half a mile. I was starting to wonder if he really WAS going to pull me over, or if he was just fucking with me. As if in an instant of telepathy, the blues began to swirl. So much for escape.   I begrudgingly flicked on my blinker and pulled across the rumble strips and onto the shoulder. Things were about to get ugly...but how ugly, I could not know.   "Good morning, ma'am!!"  I'm 24...I don't really look like a ma'am yet, do I? cuz if I DO, then I'm going to need to SERIOUSLY consider a switch in moisturizers...but I digress...  "Do you know why I stopped you this morning?"  Yeah, I was speeding, you moron...it certainly wasn't because of my good looks...especially since you just called me ma'am.   "Do you know how fast you were going?"  Hmmm...75? Small giggle and flirtatious bat of eyelashes, just incase.   "Nope...try 80." Damn. He must be gay...or maybe I really DO look like a ma'am!!   "I'm going to need your license and registration please, ma'am..." Ok, you're rubbing salt in the wound now, buddy.   See, here's the FUNNY thing about all this. My car? The red 2000 Chevy Impala that's listed on that registration card? Yes, that's in my name. But you see there in the corner, where it says "Expiration Date"? Right there, you got it. Yep, you noticed that it's a little out of date, huh? Yeah, me too. But what REALLY stinks like rotten milk about the whole deal is that it expired in February...of...200...3. Yes. My car has been unregistered for...*gulp*...about a year.    Soooo...suffice it to say that yon Officer O'Donnell there wasn't terribly happy with me this morning. Or perhaps he was overjoyed, as he ended up making a LOT of money off of me in about a 10 minute time frame. When all was said and done, I had a $125 ticket for doing 80 in a 65, and a $136 ticket for driving an unregistered vehicle in the GREAT State of Vermont. I also got 4 points on my license in one fell swoop.   I'm not sure how much more it would have cost had he taken a peek at my inspection sticker, dated March of 2001...*cackle*

      Those are the two highlights of my late winter so far. It's only supposed to be 8 degrees tonight. I refuse to call that spring.     Mushy Tomatoes  - A very bad thing. I was grocery shopping a few weeks ago, got three lovely Romas, brought them home, chopped them up for a salad, took a big bite and proceeded to spit it right back out. BLECH!! They weren't over-ripe or anything...they were just...I don't know what you'd term it, really. Mealy, maybe? Like a really starchy potato...where it doesn't really taste like anything, and just sort of feels grainy and weird in your mouth. I'm sort of a freak about textures of foods that I eat, so the second something doesn't feel right in my mouth, I tend to spit it back out...sometimes violently. And everyone wonders why I never try a new type of food in public if I haven't had it at home first...projectile food rejection, my friend. Anyway...so this tomato was really bad. It didn't taste like tomato at all, and the aforementioned weird grainy texture made me slightly ill. I chalked it up to some sort of unfortunate local grocery store phenomenon, until last week, when I went to Super Big Chain Grocery World (which I detest, but I had no choice at the time), purchased several little Roma gems thinking that they'd make up for past icky tomato incident, and proceeded to spit THOSE out the next day after the first fork full of salad as well. What's going ON here?! Have all the tomatoes gone to hell? So upsetting!! Alright, so I gave it one last try today...maybe it's just the ROMAS that are crap lately...maybe all these stores are getting them from the same inadequate source. So...I trucked on over to Jake's Deli to get one of their super-awesome veggie grinders (let me tell you, just as a brief aside, about these grinders. They ROCK. Any other place, if you order a veggie grinder, you get lettuce, tomato, onion, and if you're lucky maybe a pickle tossed on a roll. Sorry, no. At Jake's, you get the lettuce, tomato, RED onions (yay!), green peppers, shredded carrots, oh yeah, I'm still going baby...black olives, sprouts, HOT petters if you want them...it's absolute heaven. Slap some horseradish cheddar on that bitch and LET me at it!!)...I ordered the grinder, I watched it being made, I drooled helplessly the whole way back to my office, I did my little lunch preparation ritual (wash hands, fold up two pieces of paper towel just so for napkin use, place sandwich on plate, sit at desk, proceed to munch), I took that first glorious bite of beloved sandwich and....PTHT! Spit out a mushy tomato!!! Not even a Roma...a regular run of the mill deli tomato...MUSHY!! GRAINY!!  ICKY!!  Why? WHY, CRUEL WORLD?! The phenomenon was suddenly global...or at least state-wide...ish. What gives? Is it just because where ever these tomatoes are being grown, they're being artificially ripened or something? If I go to the Co Op and buy organic tomatoes, are they going to be mushy?! I know, I should be buying organic anyway...but I'm not going to if they're just going to be mushy! DAMN IT!!      Town Reports  - I work at a digital printing shop. We do Xerox-type on-demand stuff...on gigantic Xerox machines, in fact. Anyway...we also trim, bind, etc. Digital printing, if you're just printing black text, is pretty dirt cheap. So...we consequently end up doing craploads of town reports every february. Where I came from, the town report was maybe 125 pages total, 5.5x8.5 inches, pastel card-stock cover, staple-bound. We do town reports that are perfect-bound (like an actual paper-back book)...town reports with color covers...reports with PHOTO color covers...reports with multiple sections printed on different colors of paper that we have to hand-collate together....reports by the thousands, in every form imaginable. A SMALL town report order is about 850 pieces. Doesn't sound like much, until you spend 3 hours in front of a stitcher, collating the cover with the text pages and feeding each individual booklet into the stitcher by hand so that it can get stapled and folded. Or until you have to take 850 booklets, all slipping and sliding against each other and just generally being uncooperative, and try to face-trim them on a gigantic guillotine-type cutter. Just trying doing more than like 5 at a time. See how many fingers YOU have when you're done. Town reports are just a pain in the ass, basically. It wouldn't be so bad if everyone didn't wait until the last minute...but we had very little work all through January...it was like a morgue in here some afternoons...and then suddenly, the second week of February, all of these really nervous twitchy town clerk types are buzzing in and out of here dropping off CD's of Word documents and Excel spreadsheets, mumbling on their way out that a finished product by the 24th would be great....25th is a must. Yeah, ok, no probl...wait. The 25th?! Are you nuts?! You just gave me a CD full of incompatible files, typos, you won't choose a cover color because I don't have the exact shade of PUKE YELLOW you had last year, you're unreachable between the hours of 7am and 7pm to be able to PROOF the thing, you ordered 2500 of them, it has 4 different sections on 4 different colors of paper that all need to be put together by hand because my company is too cheap to buy more than one paper drawer for our machines (otherwise we'd be able to run the pages all together and they'd come out all collated and happy and ready to go. How useful would THAT be?!)....AND YOU WANT IT IN 4 DAYS?! SHHHHHHEEEEE-YYYUUUUUUUUHHHHHH!!! Dream ON, my friend...

      I don't do well with silence. I need noise, however faint it may be. Quiet makes me think too much...and pretty soon I'm not amounting to anything because I'm stuck in my own little hyper-analytical world of dread.  Right now someone is taping boxes in the other room. It's annoying...but it's noise. I can hear Josh around the corner, typing his little fingers off, as well. Farther back, I can here the docs running out in the print room. From far away, they sound just like giant refrigerators when they turn on and run. Up close, they're very loud and make lots of interesting squeaks and grumbles...but from here, it's a pleasing quiet hum. Just enough to keep me from delving into said weird silence-induced semi-panic mode.  I like hearing people talk, too. Even when they're not talking to me or about me, it's nice to be able to focus on a voice. My mom has always accused me of having selective hearing, when in fact what happens is that I hear absolutely fine as long as I'm not close to two sources of sound at once. If I'm standing next to the doc out in the other room, someone can be 3 feet from me speaking in a normal voice and I won't be able to hear them. It annoys people a lot of the time. They think I'm not paying attention to them. That hurts my feelings. I always try to be very careful about paying attention to someone who's talking to me, unless it's obvious that they are just talking shit, in which case yes...I have been known to tune a person out once in a while.  When I am trying to get to sleep, the only thing that really helps me is the hum of a fan. I am completely intolerant of the TV being on when I’m trying to sleep, because whatever is on the TV will get into my head as I’m drifting off, and give me nightmares Even something as benign as cartoons. Nightmares about Smurfs are more disturbing than one might think. Also, the sounds that someone in the bed beside me tends to keep me awake, as well. I always pick on my best friend, Maggie, because I can’t usually stand sleeping in the same bed with her. As she drops off to sleep, she twitches. A lot. I know that everyone actually does this…it’s a normal bodily reaction, it’s part of our shut-down process…but when one person is awake and witnessing the other’s twitching, it can be unnerving. She also makes gutteral noises when she sleeps. It’s not really talking…but it’s not snoring, either. It’s kind of a gusty noise, like a “uhh-HMPH….hhhhHHMPH…” noise. It’s like she wants to snore, but she can’t quite get the energy up…or like she’s meditating, and kind of letting out a hum at the end of each deep breath. It keeps me awake because she always falls asleep so quickly, and I’m always jealous. I wish I could just drop right off like that. So…being the jealous and selfish person that I am…I make her sleep on the couch when she comes over…*cackles*  ;)

      I've done a bad, bad thing.   Well...not really, but it's always fun to pretend...heeeee...*grin*  Anyway...the only thing bad I can come up with that I've done recently is that I neglected my poor little blog for like...a week. It's pretty sad to begin with, and then when I don't post for a week...well...you know what I mean.   I have decided, after much mulling over, that I will only allow myself one "know what i hate?" post a week. If I'm going to vent my negativity, I've decided that I need to force myself to find a better way to do it, rather than just logging on here, spewing crap for like 4 pages, then wandering off for a week. So, in accordance with said new Less Negativity policy, I will NOT speak of the disgusting display of idiocy on Meet The Press this morning, and how I could not sit through the entire 1 hour interview with that TWAT of a president we have. I will also not bring up the fact that the temperature has decided once again to dip into the single digits...for the HIGH...and I will refrain from ranting about the absurdity of the middle-management type jackasses that I put up with at both of my jobs. I won't bring any of these up. At least...not anymore than I think I just did.  Do you ever dream about getting something super-romantic from your partner for Valentine's day? Normally I'm not big into the V-day stuff, as I think that for the most part it's just an over-Hallmark'ed opportunity to cash in on people's willingness to follow...but sometimes it's nice to sit around and dream up extravagant things that one would never in a million years ever get for Valentine's day. I'm just sort of a mushy sappy person at heart (stop laughing...it's true!), and the thought of things like flowers and candy and cute stuffed animals really do make me grin like an idiot. Then there's the thought of a 3-carat total weight 3-stone diamond ring, with the center stone being yellow and the flanking stones pure white, set on a white-gold band...you know...nothing like $7K-$8K in diamonds to make a girl's heart go pitter-pat...*grins*  Honestly, a bunch of daisies and a heart-felt love note from my honey would mean a million times more to me than aforementioned rocks...but once in a while, can't a girl dream? ;)

      mondays suck. even when nothing bad happens, they suck. Everyone whines on mondays, and usually about really stupid shit. Some dumb things I've had to listen to people whine about today:  1)  the pats won / the panthers lost.  people, get over it. it's a football game. if you have enough disposable income to be betting money on football, then don't bitch to me when your team loses. Take that money and give it to a good cause, like MDA.   2)  you partied too hard all weekend.   know what? i worked all weekend. i'm glad that you were able to go out and have fun and whoop it up, but don't come to me with a hang-over sob story, because i'm honestly not that interested. i don't care if it WAS a rager of a party...i didn't get to go, therefore i do not need details.   3) you hurt yourself doing something stupid.   yes, i know that mens-league basketball is your life, your sun and moon and stars, the air you breath and the food you eat...but that doesn't make me give a shit...especially if you're someone that i'm not fond of anyway...ie: my boss. Don't come in to work clutching your shoulder, saying you think you broke your collarbone, because that's not your collarbone, you dumb-ass. what you're clutching and what you just showed me the bruise on is your shoulder...more specifically, your acromion. Pay more attention in health class in your next life, bucko...if nothing else, it'll make your lies a leeeeetle more convincing.   4) someone that you knew for like 3 days cut you loose, thus putting you in a pissy mood for everything else that goes on for the rest of the day.  you went on  one  date with him. and you know what else? you're annoying. i can see why he'd cut you loose before anything even developed. and don't give everyone shit about the pile of work you just got handed that you don't wanna do, because i don't wanna do mine either, but that's what we're here for. suck it up.   5) your company waited until literally the last minute before a gigantic conference to finish up a project that you need printed in two days....and now my printer is down.  Yes, you can go to another printer, but it's going to take twice as long and cost twice as much. You should have been thinking about that two months ago when you called me for a price quote and you had the files in hand. Now you're pretty much at the mercy of the guy who WE'RE at the mercy of when it comes to printer maintenence. Welcome to my world.   ok...i'm done whining about other people whining. i think...

      Vindication is a sweet, sweet thing.  I brought my lunch to work yesterday. It was a frozen dinner...a Smart Ones...in the bright red box. I like them...the Chicken and Rigatoni Alfredo with Broccoli is REALLY yummy. It's my favorite, in fact. Anyway...so I had one in the freezer and I was feeling too slovenly to make a salad yesterday morning before work, so I said "hey! I'll take that yummy frozen dinner!". I took it out of the freezer. I distinctly remember setting it on the counter about 10 minutes before I left, because I knocked over my wallet when I did, and my checkbook and all my receipts (I keep them but I never write them down...hah!) when flying all over the floor. Anyway...so after I picked up the contents of my wallet, I went upstairs to get dressed. I gathered up my stuff when I was getting ready to leave: wallet, keys, yogurt, Smart Ones yummy frozen happiness for lunch, and two bills that I needed to drop in the mail box. All systems go...now hurry up or you're gonna be late.   I rolled into work at 8.30, as per usual. I brought all my stuff in and spread it out all over the kitchen counter like I always do, and punched in at the time clock. Yogurt and Smart Ones went into the fridge, keys in my pocket, etc. I did my normal morning shuffle...fill the water bottle, turn the computer on, cup of coffee, check email...yada, yada. It was just about 11.30 when I started to hear grumbings of lunch plans out in the production room. Chinese was suggested...and I bit. I couldn't help it. The thought of egg rolls and hot-and-sour seafood chowder was just too tempting. So...I didn't think much about my Smart Ones all day long.   Then 5.15 rolled around, and it was time for me to go gather my stuff up and go to second job. Keys? check. Wallet? check. jacket? check. Smart Ones that I didn't eat for lunch but would scarf down for dinner? ....  Ahem. Frozen dinner?  HELLO?! Where's the frozen dinner? It didn't just grow legs and walk away....  ...did it?  The Smart Ones wasn't in the fridge anywhere. I even moved stuff around to see if it had gotten stashed in the back. I looked around, bewildered. Could I have left it on the counter or something? I scanned the kitchen area. No bright red box. Odd. I stood there with my hands on my hips, contemplating. Perhaps I never actually took it out of the car that morning? I wandered out to the car and looked around. Not on the passenger seat, where I know I set it that morning. On the floor? No...under the seat? Nope, no Smart Ones there. In the back? No. What the fuck is going on?!   I was peeved at this point. Not only had my dinner come up missing, but more importantly, I was beginning to think I'd lost my god damned mind. I drove to my other job, going over every move that I'd made that morning. i was POSITIVE that I'd put the dinner in the fridge at work. I KNEW that I had.   Second job came and went, and the Smart Ones mystery bothered me the whole time. The only thing I could think was that somehow I managed to leave it on the counter at home when I left that morning. I drove home, fully expecting my Smart Ones to be sitting there glaring at me from the counter. Opened the door...nothing there on the counter. WHAT THE?!  I stood there in my kitchen, looking around wildly. Where in the name of Sam Elliot could that thing have gone? Did I hallucinate the whole fucking day? Did I never take the shit out of the freezer to BEGIN with? My heart raced as I reached for the freezer door. If the Smart Ones was in there, would it prove that I was mentally unstable? Would I flip out? Would I lose my appetite completely?   Finally, I couldn't take it. I opened the door and peeked into the freezer. No bright red box. NO SMART ONES IN MY FREEZER!!! What gives?! I spent the rest of the evening in a fog of confusion, unsure of where to turn. I felt as though my entire day had simply been a bad dream...but that I'd lost something important along the way. I went to bed feeling hungry, and slightly hurt.   This morning, I was super careful to double-check everything that I brought to work with me. I even put it all in my back-pack, just as a precaution. That way if I lost one thing, I lost everything, and I would at least know that I hadn't gone insane. Plus, a huge black back-pack is theoretically easier to find if lost than a small red box.   I got to work and unpacked my stuff, and Cathy and Pam were milling around in the kitchen. I was embarassed, but I HAD to ask.   "Guys...did either of you come across a random frozen dinner just sitting around here at some point yesterday or this morning?" Cathy shook her head.   "Nope...haven't seen one. Why?"  I proceeded to tell them the story. Pam started laughing toward the end of it. I didn't see the humor in the fact that I was convinced I'd lost my mind, and I stated such. She pointed at the garbage can.   "Is that it?" she asked, snickering. I looked. There it was! My Smart Ones!! My Rigatoni Alfredo with Chicken and Broccoli!! I almost dove for it, but I was thankfully able to hold myself back.   "Yes!! How'd it get in there?!"  She laughed again.   "I threw it away last night before I left. I thought it was one that I'd brought in earlier in the week, because I never see you bringing them in. I figured it had gone bad from being thawed out all week, so I tossed it!"   Although I mourned for my favorite Smart Ones and the $2 that had been wasted by it being thrown away, I was secretly very relieved to find that I, in fact, am not insane. So much.  At least, not today....although writing this whole huge thing about it has made me begin to wonder a little...

      some random things about me you did not know/do not care to know/did not ever really wonder about me:  - I do not sing in the shower...but I sing in the car.   - I am incapable of falling asleep with the tv on in the background.   - I notice and memorize license plate numbers on cars without even realizing it. Family, friends, cars that I see on my commute every morning...I know hundreds of them. And yet, I can not remember my bank account number.   - I hate my body, but I think I have a pretty face.   - I have not bought a new pair of shoes in almost 3 years. And it's not been for lack of needing them.   - I have more male friends than female friends. I don't honestly know why that is, other than that guys seem to appreciate my demented sense of humor better than most girls. It's certainly not because of my looks...hah!   - I have a black cat, Newton, but he does not live with me. He lives with my mom and dad. I would bring him to my house but I'm afraid of him getting in the road and getting run over.   - My dad used to send me postcards when I was in college. He would write the message on the back as if it was coming from our pets. He would even sign it with the pets' names and draw little paw prints.   - I love Cheetos.   - I have a tattoo - it's blue, and it's an outline of a star on the back of my neck. I want to get another one. I cried when I got it done, but not because of the pain. I liked the feeling of the needle, in a weird way.  - I'm bad with money.   - I wear one ring all the time...a little silver band around the middle finger of my right hand. I always take it off when I go to bed, and when I get in the shower or do dishes. The rest of the time it doesn't leave me. Becky and I bought matching ones at the mall a long time ago. I think she might have lost hers.   - I honestly believe in the saying "Blood is thicker than water". I think that if you can't fall back on your family, you're in pretty sad shape.   - I cry when I am overwhelmed...by anger, by sadness, by joy, by beauty.   - My grandfather died when I was 10. I go to his grave every year on or about the day he died, and I talk to him. He doesn't generally talk back.   - I've been told that I am bossy, flirty, intelligent, sneaky, intense, funny, cute, unfeeling, and caustic, among other things.   - My middle name is Lee on my birth certificate, but I've always spelled it Leigh.   - I think of random things that I did as a child and am intensely embarassed or ashamed. Some of the things I know I have no reason to be ashamed of because every child does them, and other things I worry that there was/is something wrong with me that caused me to do them.   - I wear glasses. My right eye is much weaker than my left eye.   -I've been to Belize. I went with Ben, who is a playwright from London. I met him on the internet, and we took a vacation together.  - I love to sleep, and it's often a struggle to get out of bed in the morning.   - I crochet like a fiend. Do you want an afghan or a scarf? I have 14 of each just sitting around.   - I wanted to be a teacher once...first, an English teacher, then a music teacher. Then I just wanted to be a musician...a singer. I still do. I never once wanted to work at a printing company as a book keeper.   - I love to talk to people and try to help them solve their problems, but I can't ever seem to solve my own. I am an excellent giver of advice but I rarely ever follow any that I give.   - I have a Crest SpinBrush. It rocks.   - I used to have dreams where a day would play out in my head, and the next day or the day after, that exact day would be real.  - I am intensely afraid of UFO's and anything to do with aliens.   - I can often tell when the phone is about to ring, and even sometimes who it will be. And lots of times, when someone says "Guess what!" and I guess...I'm right. It freaks some people out, so I just guess silently in my head now, usually.   - I used to feel smart, but now I just feel tired all the time.   - I am a witch, though only a solitary one. I've never been to a coven...i've only ever been to 3 workings that involved other people. I prefer to commune with my deities alone.   - I secretly enjoy Wheel of Fortune, though I always refer to it as Squeal of Torture, and I won't let anyone watch it if they're at my house.   - I have a yarn obsession. I buy yarn and fabric that I will never use and do not need, simply because I like it.    - It's time for me to go home. :)

      I'm annoyed, and if you stick around, I'll tell you why.    (yeah, I bet you didn't see that one coming a mile away!)  I have this project. Ok, it's a side-job. It's something that I'm supposed to be doing in my "free" time...which, as you all know, is fairly non-existent. It's this book...I have to take everything in the book (150 pgs) and type it into a spreadsheet. For the most part, that's not really a big deal...except that there's the whole no-computer-at-home problem. And the bigger, not-supposed-to-be-working-on-side-project-during-work problem. So, I figured I'd be my smart little self and work on it during my SECOND job, where they don't really care what we do as long as we answer the phone when it rings and we don't download porn. Anyway...so I saved my little spreadsheet to a disk. I've done this before when working on stuff between jobs...both my primary employer and secondary employer run the same software package, so I'm covered.   Except...when the disk doesn't work.   I got here, stuck the disk in, I was all happy about getting to work on my shit while I was here (and theoretically be getting paid for two jobs at once). I opened the A drive, I double clicked on my file....and nothing. Not one fucking thing. It didn't beep...it didn't blink...and it sure as hell didn't OPEN the file that I wanted to open. It did nothing.   Soooo...being the crafty chick that I am, I said "Fine...be that way..I'll fix you..." and I tried to drag the file off the disk and onto the desktop. I got some weird error message about how the file was inaccessible at this time, and to try again. What do you mean, inaccessible?! It's my god damned file...it will be accessed when I want to damn well access it!! So I tried again...same deal. I tried opening something else on the disk. Nada. Things were getting ugly. I messed with the stupid little thing for a good 35 minutes and got nothing over and over again. Finally, in an attempt to salvage what little bit of temper I had a tenuous hold on, I quit.   The disk, she no work.   Me? Up shit creek.   Happy about it? not so much.   I don't know if there's some little disk demon in this computer just chewing on my spreadsheet and not letting me open it or what, but I'm pissed about it. And since I now have nothing else to do this evening but sit here and stew, you're hearing about it.   Have a lovely evening.

      ...that since i'm sitting here at second job with nothing constructive to do, that I ought to post something on here. Problem is, i'm braindead. I hardly slept at all last night. this could either make for a very amusing few hours until i go home, or a very endless few. I'm leaning toward endless, since there's no one online to talk to, and no one here seems to be terribly interested in talking to me. Hmph. Be that way, then...all of you.

      Do you ever get into a mood where you just want to be alone? When you feel like you should just put on a t-shirt that says "don't even try to talk to me", pull your baseball cap down over your eyes, and just find someplace to sulk all day? I don't even have anything to sulk about...it's not even that I'm actively sulking, per se...it's just that everything everyone says to me makes me mad, for no good reason...and I in turn seem to be pissing everyone else off with my mere existence today. I hate days like that...but I guess I'm having one.   It's supposedly the first day of spring. That stupid little groundhog Puxatawney Phuckin' Phil better pray to his little gopher gods that I never come across his furry ass in a dark alley, because he will be entering a world of rodent pain. This is not spring. This is dark grey skies, heavy clouds, snow swirling in the air, and bitter cold. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, PHIL!!! You need to talk to your people and get this shit straight, because this is NOT my idea of spring-tide bliss.   It figures, man...you leave something important like spring up to a bunch of oversized guinea pigs and look where it gets you. Hmph.

      Wow...where have I been all week? Certainly not here typing my little fingers to the bone, it seems! Tres Slackage...  Anyway! So...it's friday. That automatically puts me in a wicked good mood. It also makes me automatically brain-dead...*laughs*  I have static issues. I wish I could like coat my hair in Teflon so it wouldn't become a raging ball of static shortly after it dries. "Get one of those ion dryers!" you say. Got one. Doesn't work. Makes the TV turn all funny colored when I point it that way whilst drying my hair, though. The marvels of modern science!   I'm in ditzy girl mode right now. It's really kind of embarassing. All I can think about is static-y hair and how I need to file my nails because they're getting funny-shaped. I'm sure all my hoardes of male fans will be really interested in knowing all of this. *grins*  Hmmmm...I could tell you about the huge garbage truck that just pulled in, parked in our lot, the man driving it got out and climbed up on top of it to survey the scene, I guess, then crawled back down, got back in the truck and drove away. Without emptying our dumpster. How random is that?  Speaking of random - if you want something completely messed up and pointless to giggle at, go to http://www.g-shack.com and download the Kitty Dance. It's not dirty, don't worry...but you need to have sound on your computer to appreciate it. It's funny in a really bizarre and "why would someone even bother to do this?" way. Thus, it appeals to me...heeee...;)  I want to go home. I don't want to go to my other job tonight. Two nights in a row of not having to go there has spoiled me. I can't give it up just yet as I still need the money, but still...*sigh*...it's nice to dream about getting to go home at a normal time like everyone else does! Then again, it's nice to dream about coming home to a nice boy who maybe made some dinner (or at least picked up some ice cream?) while he was waiting for me. Hmm, he could do the laundry too, while I'm dreaming. And I want a kitten in my dream, too...and a little black dog named Duke. And seeing as how I'm dreaming, I might as well dream that all my financial issues are cleared up and things like fire wood, propane, and cars are all free...  Ok...that's enough of that...I think I need to go back to work because I'm not amounting to a whole lot writing-wise here...;)

      I think that I've stopped biting my nails.   I say "I think" because I could have a relapse at any time. I am not cofident that I've conquered the beast....but i think I'm getting close.   This is going to be one of those annoying here-and-there stream of conciousness posts, by the way...so if you don't like those, run while you can...*laughs*  I will not post anything about my weekend, other than that I cheered when Dale Jr won the race yesterday, because I like Dale Jr quite a lot. Other than that, my weekend was good but involved things that shall here-to-fore remain a mystery to you...simply because I say so. You got a problem with that, then come here and start hanging out with me on the weekends and you'll know what goes on, right? RIGHT!   I got an email from one of my best friends from high school, Andrea. She's getting married in June. What's up with people getting married...why do they feel the need, when they're only 22, 23, 24 years old? I don't get it. More power to her if it's going to make her happy...it just seems like she's a completely different person now than she was in high school. Yeah, yeah cram it with all that "growing up" shit...I know how that goes. i've done a little of that myself. That's not what I'm talking about. I mean that she really seems different. Strange. Foreign. Uncomfortable. Normally I'd chalk it up to me just having a strong dislike of humanity in general and thus feeling uncomfortable around everyone except a select few...but I don't think that's it in this case. I just can't put my finger on what it is.   What else...it's sunny out, but looks like it's going to cloud up. The weather bastard said it was going to be up to 50 today, and I don't think it's cracked 40 yet...fucker. I hate that man. He's obviously not good at what he does, so they really ought to consider trading him in.   I can't go to see George Clinton and P-Funk with Maggie on Friday, which breaks my heard. They're my favorite group ever, and I really REALLy wanted to go...but I can't get the time off and make it happen. It vexes me. I am vexed.   I have onion breath because I made my salad sorta heavy on the onions this afternoon. Tasted good, though...:)  I decided this weekend that there's really nothing funnier than taking my mother to Home Depot without my dad and letting her loose. The woman just has no concept of...well...anything, really...*laughs*. I love her to bits, but sometimes she scares me. She will just wander off, and I'll be zipping back and forth through the aisles trying to find her, panicking because, OH MY GOD, I just LOST my MOTHER in Home Depot...and then just as I'm about to go to the front of the store and have her paged, she sorta shuffles around a corner all innocently, holding some sort of random tool aloft, with a cherubic grin on her face. "Do you think he'd like this?!" she'll say, refering to the birthday gift shopping for my dad, and I'll say "what is it?" and she'll look at it, beaming happily, and mumble "I have no idea...but I know he doesn't have one yet...that's a step in the right direction!"  Mind you, we were looking for a brush-cutter...which I learned is actually a weed-whacker...but with a big scary blade instead of a string. Incidentally, I might add that while those strings on the weed whackers LOOK wimpy, they FUCKING hurt. A LOT. I got whipped with one last summer whilst whacking some weeds (what else would I have been doing?!), and it left a welt the size of a freakin' Snickers bar on my shin. Snickers bar? Ok, that was maybe a bad analogy, but I couldn't think of anything else that size except like "highlighter" because that's what I was looking at, and I didn't want you to mistake the actual severity of the welt by thinking I meant one of those little skinny pen-sized highlighter. No...we're talkin' a fatty, here...*reconsiders*...ok, that was a bad analogy too, I think. In fact, let's move on, because the analogy-drawing skills seem to be just going right down the crapper now.  So anyway...I just had to meet with a customer, and while it was only like a 2-minute meeting, I had a really hard time paying attention to what she was saying because i was paranoid about my onion breath. Damn that salad was good, though. The things I'll endure for roughage...  My god, I really need to quit while I'm ahead...quick, before I start talking about how I felt threatened by the several dark hairs (and I do mean several, thank you...not tens of hundreds...there were only 8...4 on each side. Yes I counted) along my upper lip this weekend, but instead of plucking them (it hurts!), I decided to be a complete brainiac and WAX them. Word to the wise: If you think plucking hurts, do it anyway...because waxing hurts MORE. And then, after it's done hurting and the skin goes back to it's normal color and the swelling goes down, you'll notice that you've broken out in some weird little rash because your skin is so delicate. It's less of an across-the-room "hey what happened to your face, Shelby?" rash, and more of a close-up, perfectly-facial-hair-free-customer-right-in-your-face-smelling-your-onion-breath type "Oooohhhh...your lip looks sore! What happened? Is it a cold sore?"  NO IT'S NOT A COLD SORE!!! "Well how did you get it?"  I got chaffed from the short-and-curlies of the YAK I was fellating this WEEKEND, you idiot...WHAT do you care how I got it?!?! Mind your own god damned business!   Sheesh! ;)

      I have a little routine when I come into work in the morning. I turn the computer on, I go out into production and say hi to everyone and see what's happening, I come back into my office and check my email, and I read some blogs. I always check Production Maven, Not So Simple, Deb's Cafe, and Random Rantings (and of course my own blog) before I do anything productive.   Anyway, this morning I was making my quick little blog rounds and when I went to Jon's blog, there was a comment on it that got me really torqued up. I responded to the comment there...but it would only let me post 1,000 characters...and I'm sure you all know just how hard it is for me to rein myself in to 1,000 characters or less! ;) So I feel the need to expand upon what I posted as a comment. In order to do that, I have to do a little bit of filling in for you:  Jon's original post was about how a friend of his in Iraq told him that troops are no longer allowed to fly the American flag outside over there. There was a comment made by someone (who at first was a coward and didn't put his name to his comment...but that's a whole other can of worms to open some other time, mind you...) that Americans are too "wrapped up" in their flag, and that we needed to "realize that they're not the only country on the face of the earth". Ok...that was his opinion...I was ok with that...until he said that Jon's views "smashing their religion show ignorance and intolerance".  The things that Jon said, while possibly not the most enlightened words ever typed, were certainly not "smashing" their religion...and not what I would call ignorant OR intolerant. The fact that the anonymous person then posts again (after several angry comments from myself and others)  to say that the other people's comments were childish and that fundamentalists are simply misinterpreted really annoyed me, as well.   What it comes down to for me is this: Flying a flag is freedom of speech. It's not an attempt to asimilate any ethnic group, it's not an offensive or demoralizing act. Respect is a two-way street...that's all there is to it. If it were an Iraqi immigrant living in the US who wanted to fly their homelands' flag outside their door, some people might cringe...but by and large we would know that it's that person's right to fly that flag if they want to. Even closer to home: in the south, many feel that the Rebel flag represents slavery, bigotry and racism. Lots of people are offended by the flying of the Rebel flag...but again, it's freedom of speech. The Rebel flag stands for a lot more than just the bad things that some people associate with it. Similarly, the American flag stands for a lot more to many people than just self-righteousness and greed. I think that if a soldier wants to fly his flag and be proud of where he came from, he should be able to do it...whether he's stationed in Iraq, Hawaii, or the frickin' South Pole.   I am not normally an outwardly patriotic person. I do not approve of how we came to be in Iraq. I think the entire thing was handled in a terrible manner. I don't like Bush one bit...not his policies on Iraq, the economy, his stance on gay marriage...none of it. I think he's an idiot. But it's not our troops' fault that Bush made some stupid mistakes. They are not at fault because his ego is bigger than his brain. They're the ones who are making a huge sacrifice in order to go over there and help build Iraq back up. I have an enormous amount of admiraiton and respect for anyone in the armed forces of ANY free country, because they're busting their asses and giving up things that frankly, I'd have a real hard time giving up, in order to make this world a better place. That takes a hell of a lot of guts, whether you're from America, the U.K., France, Germany, or where ever.   There...I think I have that out of my system now...*grins*    Oh, and if you're going to post a comment and get all snarky with me, have the balls to put your name on the shit when you post, otherwise I'm going to give you all TYPES of hell for being a coward. Just a fair warning. :)

      As most of you know, I work two jobs. I work 8.30 to 5 at my "regular" job, and then 5.30 to 8.30 at my other job. I also have about a 35-40 min commute each way. Wednesday is the one day that I have off from my second job. Wednesday means that I get to go home at 5pm like everyone else (except that I usually hang out here well after 5, just goofing off on the computer, but I digress). I like wednesdays....:)  I don't really have anything to write about, as you may have picked up on by now...*giggles*. I just wandered into work feeling a little spaced and didn't feel like doing payroll yet, so I'm sorta sitting here screwing around and avoiding it.   In other news...my dad turns 50 next thursday. He wants a chain saw. I think those are probably pretty expensive, so I'm probably not going to get him one. I don't really know what TO get him, though. He'd like anything that I got him...but he's the type of guy that, if you get him something useful...something he REALLY likes, he'll talk about it all the time. Every time he uses that item, he'll let you know that he used it again, and yep! It still works GREAT!! He's very funny like that.  It's probably kind of stupid, but seeing my parents turn 50 makes me feel really old...*laughs*  I know, I know...i'm only a baby...24 is not old at all...but seeing them get older is definitely making me realize that I should get my shit together and make something of my life, because I'm not always going to be able to, you know? That's not to say that they didn't make something of their lives...but they both had a lot of potential that ended up having to get put by the wayside because they didn't have the opportunities (or perhaps the desire...at least at the time) to utilize it. Where as I have all the desire and the opportunity in the world, but no potential...*cackles*  One more thing before I go. I can't go a whole post without being slightly bitchy. Here goes: I get this email from a customer of mine. This is an account that I deal with, and only me. This is because it sorta landed in my lap when the sales rep that we used to have left, because my "boss" couldn't handle the extra work. So...I got stuck with this account. At first it was ok, and I was sort of happy to have my own account to work on...but now I want to kick them every time they call or email. Which is daily...3-4 times a day, usually. There are two people who contact me, and it's a total case of the right hand not having a clue what the left is doing. We print books for them and drop-ship them (which is the biggest pain in the ass EVER...but whatever), and I'm supposed to email this one person the tracking number when I send a shipment. Sometimes I forget. Maybe that's because I also do payroll, accounts payable, accounts receivable, filing, write up jobs, answer 4 phone lines, and do all the bull-shit work that my "boss" doesn't seem to have time for (because he sits there and talks to 16 year old girls on yahoo messenger all day...but again, I digress). My point is that these people seem to be convinced that I exist simply to ship their god damned books. One of them will call at random intervals throughout the day and just VENT to me over the phone about shit going on at HER job. Hello?! I'm not your friend!! I don't like you!! I am PAID to be nice to you!! I am the printing industry equivalent of a HOOKER, here. You pay me, and I do things for you...simple as that. Don't send me snotty emails asking where the tracking number from yesterday is...don't call me and bitch about how you're sooooooooooo swamped that you had to cancel your MASSAGE appointment this afternoon...don't come in here and talk about how you're gaining back the 10 pounds that you lost to fit into your wedding dress, and it's making you so depressed that you think you might go get your nails done. I shit you not, people...those are REAL things that this person has said to me. I don't make these things up. It's infuriating!!!!!!!  Whew...thanks...I feel better now...;)

      This is just a quickie for now - I just got an email from my cousin Becky, with her review of The Passion Of Christ, which she saw last night. Now granted, most of you don't know Becky so you don't know how she and I talk to each other so a little bit of the humor might be lost, but it's still the funniest movie review I think I've ever read. PS: when she says "crouching style", she's refering to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, which was subtitled and she and I had endless fits of laughter the entire way through the movie because we COULD NOT pay attention to it AT ALL. Her boyfriend at the time was with us, and threatened to leave us there at the movie theater if we didn't shut up. Heeeeee....*grins*  Anyway, here you go. Enjoy! ;)  "...the Jesus movie wasn't like JESUS, JESUS....it was like well....theres satan and theres jesus and look, lets beat the living shit out of him and oops, Judas is killing himself and theres the cross, there he goes...satan comes back again....and then jesus rolls the stone away...and its in hebrew but it was WICKED easy, not like crouching style , there actually wasn't a lot of talking and you could get what was going on by just the movie....it was INTENSE...i smoked a cig afterwards. it was like....DUN_TA_DUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNN......

      I...have a new obsession. Well, technically it's an existing obsession that has recently been renewed.   I LOVE motorcycles. Real motorcycles....not Kawasaki moto-cross crotch-rockets. I love Harleys...chrome and fancy paint and that deep chugging sound they make...excuse me, I'm drooling.   I know, I know...you all know how I feel about cars in general to begin with. You are aware of my affinity for all things geared and gas-powered. You know that my blood pressure rises about 10 points even from hearing the roar of a powerful engine from afar. You know that I lust after sparkly paint jobs, ground effects, NOS injectors, and just generally pimped-out rides. And that's not even going into what happens when I occassionally get the chance to DRIVE something so divine.   But motorcycles are different. I can't control myself. I sit here and look at pictures of choppers for HOURS...and I don't get bored. I drool over the details, the motors, the paint, the men who build them...EVERYTHING. I can't help it. I think there is just something so fundamentally masculine about motorcycles that they make me swoon like a stupid 16 year old.   I love it...;)  So go Google up Orange County Choppers, West Coast Choppers, and Midwest Choppers (TONS of pictures on their site...excellent site)...you can almost feel the wind blowing in your hair, can't you?!

      I know, I know...EVERYONE is anti-monday...but this is a band-wagon that I can not help but jump on. Mondays always seem 10 times longer than any other day. Granted, every day feels long when you work 60-70 hours a week, but still...you know what I mean.   So...yeah. My boss got in trouble today. Like...bigtime trouble. And you know what? I was kinda happy about it. Isn't that evil? I never thought I'd be like that...but deep down inside, I was honestly saying to myself "THERE, you fuckwit...take that!". It's such a long story that I couldn't possibly relate the whole thing without putting you all to sleep, but suffice it to say that I'm not just saying that my boss is a fuckwit for no good reason. The kid...and he IS a kid, because I'm a kid and he's not much older than me...is a weasel. He really is. He is slippery, and he knows it. He's good at being slippery, which is fucking infuriating. He can take a situation where he is obviously and blatantly at fault, and somehow twist it so that he looks like the fucking savior by the time it's all said and done. I can't stand that...mostly because I AM a hard worker. I DO my job, and all my co-workers and customers will tell you that I do it WELL. I don't always enjoy what I do, but I do it the best that I can regardless, because that's how I was brought up. I don't half-ass things. My boss is the KING of half-assing, but he gets away with it. He's the king of fucking things up and passing the buck, and it drives me up the fucking wall. So yeah...I was glad when I got copied on an email from HIS boss, ripping him a new asshole for the fact that he hasn't finished billing out ANY jobs for February yet. That's an entire month of billing just SITTING there waiting for him to figure pricing on so that I can type it up and send it out and eventually get PAID for it. I dunno about YOU, but that's not how I'D wanna run a business, either.   So anyway...he got bitched out, and I enjoyed it. I wish it'd been a little more vocal, and I wish it'd ended with him either quitting or getting fired, but hey...it's monday...i can't have it all, right?! ;)

      Last night I had the weirdest dream of my (rather extensive) sleeping career. I will preface this by noting that a) I have not watched professional wrestling on TV in probably 10 years or more, and b) I had not watched anything weird on TV before going to bed last night. So…analyze this:    I dreamt that I was hanging out at a party. At this party were a bunch of people who seemed vaguely familiar to me, but no one that I was really friends with. I was sort of just making small talk here and there but was pretty bored. It was your normal hang-out type party…lots of 20-somethings milling around, holding drinks, laughing and talking. There was nothing weird about any of them, really. People were going in and out of the room fairly regularly. I looked up at one point and watched as The Rock (of WWE wrestling and action movie fame) walked in. He walked in…in his wrestling get-up. All he had on was black wrestler trunks and those weird, tall black boots they wear. No one thought anything of it I guess, because he just walked right in and started mingling. No one was like “Hey…it’s The Rock!!” or anything. He came over to me at one point and we started chatting, getting to know one another, and apparently we were really into each other. Eventually he had to leave (Maybe Vince paged him or something? I don’t know…), and I was really bummed out that he had to go. I said something corny as he was leaving…something like “Will I ever see you again?” and he replied with something equally as corny, like “If it was meant to be, then we’ll meet again!” and he was gone. The dream then flashes forward a couple days, and I was at another gathering, but I was one of the first people there. People started to filter in slowly, and The Rock was nowhere to be seen. I sat near a window, kind of staring broodingly out into the distance (I know, right?!), and I remember being generally upset that The Rock had not shown up. Then out of nowhere I look up at the doorway and in he walks, in the same wrestling garb as before. He walks directly over to me, takes my face in his hands, smiles and says “See? I told you so…” and plants this KISS on me. And I mean a KISS…one that I remembered even after I woke up. A really REALLY good one. I was like “god DAMN…”  and then I woke up.   Isn’t that the most random thing, ever? I can’t figure it out. I did eat some weird leftover seafood stuff for dinner right before I went to bed…has seafood ever had that effect on anyone YOU know?! I mean…dreams about passionate kisses from professional wrestlers? It was like WWE meets The Wonder Years…*giggles*

      Some people are so nice....so nice that you almost wonder if they ever get mad. You almost wonder if there's any sort of rage under that smooth veneer. They're so calm and collected and nice that you can pretty much bet that they've GOT to be on SOME sort of happy drugs. I talk big about being mean and bitchy, but for the most part, I'm not, at least not to anyone in person. I am when I'm on here, because this is my outlet...I use this blog to purge the bitch from my system, for the most part. This allows me to lead a calmer, saner life as a whole. I don't rage at people to their faces unless the transgression is so great as to set me off. I'm typically a fairly laid back person, until someone really grinds their heel against my last nerve, and then yes, I have been known to snap and go postal. I don't know why I brought any of that up, other than the fact that I made my blog rounds this morning and everyone just seems to be posting bland, tame, boring, NICE stuff. My attention span is to short for nice...*grins*  Anyway...so Maggie leaves for Alaska on the 7th. She's going to be gone until September. In the 10 years that we have been friends, I've never been more than 3 hours away from her, and I've never gone more than about 2 months without seeing her. I don't make friends very easily. I have a hard time letting people in and trusting them. Maggie is one of very few people I know that I feel comfortable being my absolute self around. I could tell her that I was just out back murdering kittens, and she'd be horrified, but she'd understand. I don't know what I'm going to do without her...:(  I'll be back...I have to go do work now.

      I got caught speeding again.   WAIT....calm down...I didn't get a ticket, I swear to you! There...better now? Ok, deep breaths. Now let me continue...;)   So...I got caught speeding again. Mumsies and I were coming back from our weekly ritual trek to the Super Center (yeah, yeah...I KNOW, I know...corporate pigs, etc etc...I can't help it. Groceries are cheaper there. You wanna know how much my local mom-and-pop is getting for a box of cereal these days? It ain't pretty!! But I digress...).  Damn it...let me start over. And don't interrupt me this time, please. Thank you. That's a lovely hat, by the way.   So...I got caught speeding again. Mumsies and I were coming back from our weekly ritual trek to the Super Center on sunday afternoon, and I was drivin' the Vibe. The Pontiac Vibe, to be exact. (The thing drives like a roller skate in a tornado, but hey...it's her car, I'm not stuck with it!). Anyway, so we're toodling along and I look down...I'm doing 45...we're in a 40 zone...no big deal. We're both singing away to the radio...it's a nice sunny day...we're on what could be considered a back road...no traffic in site. We pitch down over a steep hill. I've coasted down this hill many a time in my driving past, and nary a once has there been a cop laying in wait around the bend...until sunday! I mutter about a cop and tap the brakes, and my mother starts in.   "Oh cute! This is really cute!! What happens if he writes you a ticket? I'm not paying for your ticket...this is YOUR ticket..."  I tuned her out shortly after that. She doesnt know anything about the last two tickets I got, but that's neither here nor there, really. Anyway, so I sail by the cop, who is quite conveniently and comfortably nestled right below a "35 MPH" sign...fucker...and my, don't the blue lights start flashing. I pull over, mom still chattering away like an angry chipmunk and struggling to put her seatbelt on (which she SHOULD have had on from the beginning but she never wears it...), and roll down my window.   Hmmm. Cop is cute. Nice h-h-hat there, officer...  He leans down a little bit and informs me that we are currently being audio and video taped. Hey...thanks for the warning. I'll just stash this 9mm under the seat for now. I think he was a rookie, too, because he didn't ask the quintessencial cop question..."Do you know why I stopped you?"  He went about it the much more accusatory way.   "Where are you ladies headed this afternoon?"   "Oh...y'know...home. That's a nice hat, by the way..."  "Thank you. It's standard issue. Anyway...what's the rush?"   "No rush...no rush at all. Just bombing down the hill I guess, not paying attention..."  I smiled, and immediately kicked myself for using the word "bomb" in a sentence addressing a police officer. Could I BE any more stupid? Probably not.   "Hmmm...well I'm going to have to run your tags. I'll need your license and registration, please." I looked at mom. She was digging through the glove box frantically. This might have been the first time she'd been pulled over in 20 years.   "Mom...registration?"   "Yes, yes...one second...here it is! No, wait...that's last year's. Ok...wait, I got it! No...no, hold on. Here, give him this..." She hands me her insurance card. We're in New Hampshire, and in New Hampshire, it isn't mandatory that you have auto insurance, where as in Vermont, it is. I try to hand him the insurance card with a sheepish grin. He eyes it.   "I don't need that. I need the registration."  No shit, bucko...  "Ok...she's just looking for it. It will be just a second."  I was having visions of him telling my mother to step out of the car at this point. Finally, I opened the middle console, just on a whim. Lo and behold...  "Here it is...sorry about that..."  I smile even more sheepishly.   "This is her car, or yours?"  I often wonder that myself...  "Hers..."  "OK, I need your license, and then I'll just go run this..."  I think he was getting bored of the dog-and-pony show we were unintentionally putting on.   "Right...one sec. It's right..."  I reached for my pocket. Debit card, cash, change...no license.  He looked slightly askance at me and I flashed yet another helplessly sheepish grin. I felt in the other pocket. Lint. Lots and lots...of lint. And nooooooo license. The plot thickens.   "Ummm...I guess I don't have it o-o-on me. Is that going to present a...erm...problem?"  He rolled his eyes at me. I swear to god, he rolled his eyes. You could almost hear him grumbling about bigger fish to fry.   "No...I'll need your name, address and date of birth, though..."  So I gave the nice man my name, address, and date of birth, and he marched back to the car to sign my arrest warrant...or so it felt like. My mom kept tittering about how it was a good thing we took her car and not mine, as we'd be in a whole lot more trouble if we were caught SPEEDING in an UNREGISTERED and UNINSPECTED vehicle. Yeah...thanks, ma. I had the sinking feeling that homeboy with the funky hat was going to come back and inform me that I had two outstanding tickets in the state of Vermont, and that he'd have to write me another. I sat there, eyes glazed over, trying not to listen to my mom, praying for any sort of help I could get from the computer glitch gods. Then he climbed back out of the cruiser. No ticket in hand!! Thank god almighty, I'm free at last!! Or...something.   He walked back up and shoved the registration under my nose.   "You're all set...I'm just going to give you a warning today. You were going 49 in a 35...that's PUSHING it, Miss Moore. Have a SAFE drive home."  I was trying very, VERY hard not to chortle with glee as I pulled away from the shoulder and inched down the hill. I handed the registration to my mom, who glanced at the officer's handwriting on it before stashing it back in the console.   "Hunh...that's weird. Didn't you spell your name out for him when he asked you for it?"  "Yeah...s-h-e-l-b-y...why?"  She held the little square of paper up and pointed to the scrawl.   "No wonder he couldn't write you a ticket...he spelled your name wrong!"   I blinked. There it was, in blue pen, right on the registration.   S-e-l-b-y.  Thank you, Officer Kaminsky, for being the worst speller in the world (and not a very good listener either, apparently!) -  you saved me a lot of money and aggrivation. ;)

      ..and I mean that in the nicest way possible. Really.   Why is it that people feel the need to just verbalize spontaneously and uncontrolably in my presence? Do I do something to prompt this? I mean...honestly! I do things that I would hope actually DISCOURAGE this practice. I scowl. I glower. I am not such a nice person, for the most part. I, in fact, tend to make it known that I'm not entirely interested in associating with human kind in general. So why on earth do people think that they can just walk up and blurt out all their issues to me, and think that I give a sweet rat's patoot? I don't care that your husband has a job interview in California tomorrow and will have to get up at 3am to get to the air port to catch his flight tonight. I don't care that you have to get a shot once every 6 months for birth control. I don't care that you've spent the last 4 hours working on the budget analysis for someone else and didn't even get thanked for it. I just don't care. I'm a mean person. Got that? MEAN!! If you're not a close friend of mine, then I don't care about the fact that your sewer line broke 3 feet into your neighbor's property and she called the health department because you didn't get it fixed promptly. In fact, I probably would have called the motherfuckers on your unsanitary ass, too!!! SO THERE!! And hey...if you're dumb enough to sit around and do hours worth of someone else's work without first hashing out arrangements for compensation of some sort, then you deserve to be taken advantage of!! Hell, if you'd do my work, I'd pawn the shit off on you too!  People, please. Don't assume that I care about your problems. Unless I have specifically uttered some semblance of the phrase "Well I'm here if you need someone to talk to...", you can pretty much bet your paycheck that I'm going to  a)  ignore you when you start talking about your cat's chronic hair-ball problems,  b)  make fun of you to your face with the absolute most sarcasm and outrageously faked interest that I can possibly muster, and/or  c)  just turn around and walk away from you when it has become clear that you have not taken the other two very obvious hints I've just dropped. There is a very short (and frequently shrinking!) list of people in this world that I give a shit about, quite frankly...and if you have to sit there and wonder IF you made that list, then it's probably safe to say you didn't.   If you don't want to get told that I've got a roll of duct tape and I ain't afraid to use it, then just leave me alone. It won't hurt my feelings...TRUST me!

      Let me first preface this rant by saying that I am not what one would call a perfectionist. Not by any stretch of the imagination. If one were to sit back and take a look at the situations I am or have been in with my life, the way I dress and act, or even the way my house looks, it would become evident fairly quickly that I am not a perfectionist. I leave wet towels on the floor. I do not iron clothing unless I absolutely can not get away with it being wrinkled. I let my check book go weeks without writing anything down, let alone actually balancing it. I am currently about 5000 miles overdue for an oil change in my car. I leave the outside light on even when I'm in for the night and not expecting company. I drink too much, I eat too much, and I swear too god damned much. I...am not...a perfectionist.    HOWEVER....   I currently work in an industry where things need to be perfect. Our customers pay us to do things RIGHT....preferably the first time around. There are no "abouts" in the printing industry. There is no such thing as "about the right yellow" or "about 5/16 of an inch". It either IS the right color yellow, or it is not. The margins either ARE 5/16 all the way around an image, or they are not. If it's not the right color yellow the first time, FIX it. If the margins are more that 5/16, TRIM SOME MORE OFF. Make it RIGHT....make it what the customer is PAYING for. I don't even run the machines, and I understand this. It is BASIC customer service, and in my opinion, it's also common sense. Wouldn't you be pissed off if you walked into a pizza place, ordered a pepperoni pizza, and when they brought it out, it was sausage? "...but...that's not what I ordered!"  you say. "Well...it's all we had...it's close enough..." the clerk says. Nu-uh...that shit don't fly.   I have a co-worker who won't ever own up to anything, even when it's very blatantly her mistake. This is also the co-worker who consumes gigantic amounts of sugar...you may remember her from past blog-rant fame. (Whether or not the massive sugar consumption and the shirking of responsibility for absolutely everything are in direct correlation to one another, I honestly do not know and had not, until just now, even considered...). Anyway...so I'm standing there today with 3000 note cards in front of me that an artist is having printed. He's a nice guy...not a stuck-up artist type like some. He deals with me exclusively because he likes the way I handle things and I, in turn, appreciate the fact that he will work only with me. It makes me feel good. It makes me want to continue to keep him happy. So...I go the extra mile for this customer. I take time out of my already VERY busy day to make sure that his jobs get finished in a timely fashion. I was taking exactly such pains this afternoon, in fact. I had his cards all stacked grouped and I asked Gil to cut them down for me, which he did to the best of his ability. He then had to run and do and errand, so I started collating the cards, getting them ready to shrink-wrap. As I was collating them, I started to notice that the margins were slightly off. Then they were more off. Soon they were 1/4 inch off. Doesn't sound like much, but on a 5 1/2 inch wide card, it shows up. I kept thinking to myself..."Gil was just cutting them in half, though...he couldn't have gotten them that far off....could he?"  I busted out a ruler to check. Nope...exactly in half, just like they should be.   Okaaaaaay...  ...so what the fuck?  I started really looking at the images on the cards. Some were fine, but others were slid over to one side of the paper or the other by sometimes 1/4 inch or more. Several of them didn't even HAVE margins because the scans had been stretched to fit the space, due to someone being careless and not setting the margins on the doc. I pointed my observations out to Ms. Sugar Buster, who happened to be walking by. She also happened to be the one who'd set up the job and run it.   me: "Hey...look at these margins. They're way off! Some of these images aren't even square on the page...look! This one's tilted almost 5 degrees!"   Sugar Buster: "Hmmm...that's weird. I know I didn't set them up like that."   me: "Well do you think it could have somehow been the way that Gil trimmed them, maybe?"   SB: "Hmmm...I dunno. Let me try..."  She then proceeds to take two of the cards, trim them down, and the margins are...of course...1/4 inch off.   me: "Well...that doesn't look too healthy. What do we do now?"    SB: "Hmmmm...I dunno. Let's see..."  She THEN proceeds to turn the card 180 degrees and trim the extra 1/4 inch off the OTHER side of the card, so that the margins are now even...BUT THE CARD IS HALF A FUCKING INCH SMALLER THAN IT"S SUPPOSED TO BE!  me: "Uhhh..."  SB: "There...how's that? Margins are even now..."  me: "Uhhh...but....look!"  I point to the text on the back of the card, the little block of "this card printed by yada yada so and so" stuff. Yeah, front of the card looks good, but on the back you can see where the text is a 1/4 inch over to one side, instead of centered.   SB: "Well...close enough, right? He can either have it perfect on the front, or on the back...not both! I don't know WHY it printed that way...that's NOT the way I set it up..."   Welp, Sugar Buster, that's where you're WRONG, because you know what? It was your mistake, and you're going to eat it. You're going to have to put yourself behind tomorrow in order to fix your mistake, because you were too fucking lazy to fix it to begin with. Josh and I went through all the cards, measured them up, salvaged what we could, and alllllllllll the rest have to be re-done. This is a huge hassle, not just for Sugar Buster, but more so for me because every time we have to reprint something, there's a bunch of paperwork and the requisite someone-yelling-at-someone-else-about-being-more-careful that has to be done. I don't do the yelling...nor do I get yelled at, when it's not my mistake, but still. It's costing the company money, it's probably going to make the job late for my customer, it's going to make ME look bad, and god damn it, it was a stupid mistake to begin with. So get out of my face, quit wasting my time, and go do something RIGHT for a change...if possible.   GAH!

      I just heard that song on the radio on my way in here and it's now quite firmly stuck in my head. Perhaps it's time for me to turn the muzak on...*grins*  Well, I got half my wish from yesterday. It DID stop raining...it was gorgeously sunny and bright out today...but it was far from warm. Actually, the sun itself was nice and warm, but the wind was howling all day and it was pretty damn cold. Supposed to be up in the 60's this weekend, though. You don't even know how happy that makes me!!   I don't really have a whole lot to talk about at the moment. Nothing terribly exciting has gone on lately, aside from a frantic call from my neighbor yesterday afternoon, asking that I be on "cat duty" as he had to leave town unexpectedly until Saturday. He also left me a card with a note and $10...so I figure I'll be nice and watch out for the cats. He's a good guy...I actually feel bad taking his money, seeing as how he's only about 30 yards across the way, and his cats are pretty easygoing. Then again...if he's got $10 he's trying to rid himself of now and then, I'm not going to refuse it.   I have to go home and put the finishing touches on cleaning my house tonight. The listers are coming to appraise my landlady's holdings for tax purposes, and I figured it would be a good idea to maybe clear a path for them to walk through the house, at least...*giggles*. Then I got all into psycho spring cleaning mode and just hoed the place right the fuck out over the weekend. It felt SO good! My kitchen has never been cleaner! I just need to pick up all the clothes all over the floor in my room tonight. Funny how I can keep the rest of my house reletively clean, but my room is always a complete tip.   I have a little bit of a "christ i'm sick of sitting inside and being stagnant" headache...I'd really like to figure out a way to get out of being here and go home, but I have a feeling that's not going to happen. *sigh*  There's this girl that I work with...she talks like a valley girl...to a very extreme degree. It doesn't help that she's dumber than a box of hair anyway, and then with the way she talks, it's just fucking nauseating. In a tragic but comic twist of fate, she also seems to think that she's smarter than everyone else. She's an extreme busybody. She's the type of person who will, for example, realize that someone (ie: me) wasn't given outbound calls to do for an evening, and she will literally get up and go into the other room, find the supervisor, and TELL HER that someone was not given calls to do. And if the supervisor says "Yes, I know, I did that for a reason...", this girl has the balls to stand there and ARGUE with the supervisor, saying that she thinks SHE has too much work to do, and SHE should be able to give half her call list to someone ELSE (ie: me, who has thus far escaped being given a list of calls). I don't know if you can really, honestly FATHOM how increadibly much that PISSES me OFF. I want to strangle her. No, check that...I want to BREAK her. IN HALF. And beat her upper half with the sticky and bleeding stump of her lower half. Repeatedly.   Hmmm...the things I think of to write about when I just get on here and ramble...;)

      ...better bring some god damned May flowers, or I'm going to be pissed.  And I DO mean pissed.   It's been raining for 3 days. My brain is waterlogged. I want to see the sun. I want it to be warm...  I have been here since 8.30 this morning and I had no lunch break and I want to go home now...so goodnight!

      ...you know what? I just spent 20 minutes writing the most sarcastic, scathing, bitchy and murderous post you could ever imagine. I sat here and did the final read-through like I always do before I post, and I stopped. I deleted all of it. I'm not going to waste any more of my time or energy today being pissed off at the world. It's not worth it, and it doesn't get me anywhere. Yes, I'm still in a bad mood, but I'm not going to dwell on it any more than I just did, because it DOESN'T FIX ANYTHING. I know a couple people who should really (and I mean really) consider doing the same thing...not dwelling on the bullshit in their lives...because it might very well make a noticable difference in their everyday grind. Then again, everyone's got their own problems, and I'm not the type to tell anyone how to live their life. Do whatever the hell you want...just don't expect me to constantly be there to pick up your pieces every time you fall apart.

       news : Got an email from Andrea this morning. She eloped, apparently. Go you, Andrea. I really hope he's everything you want him to be, because you deserve to be happy...just keep in mind that you only get one swing...life's not made for do-overs....   reviews : I watched a couple movies this weekend which bear reviewing because one was really good and one fucking SUCKED.     Solaris  : this was the good one. I actually didn't like it at all when I was watching it...It's fairly sparse in character development, which always frustrates me. It was also sort of melodramatic for my tastes...and it left me feeling strange and empty afterward. But...it made me think. And the more I thought about it, the more I decided I liked it. I'm not going to tell you about the actual plot because it would sorta ruin it for you. You should watch it at some point, though....especially if you often ponder what happens when we die. It posed some very interesting ideas.     Punch Drunk Love  : Please don't waste your money renting this movie. It fucking SUCKED. It had NO redeeming qualities whatsoever. Adam Sandler was trying...I will give him credit for that...but he REALLY didn't have much to work with, story-wise. It was just stupid and confusing and pointless, and there's no reason you should ever watch this movie, even if someone offers you free beer and sex and pizza and chocolate and a massage and...and....and....just don't do it, ok? Unless someone offers you money...cuz that's just a no-brainer...but otherwise, stay strong and resist!  I'd also like to post a review of a wonderful band I had the pleasure of seeing this weekend. I went to Middle Earth to see The Benders on saturday night. They were absolutely fantastic. I can't honestly come up with words to describe how freaking GOOD this band is. They're just awesome. They do bluegrass, but it's rock-folk-blues hardcore bluegrass. It's great. They were just so tight, they worked off of each other so well, and they played with so much energy and passion...it was great. Not to mention that they were all extremely talented musicians, and their song writing was amazing as well. I paid $12 to get in...I would happily pay twice or 3 times as much to see them again. I think part of the draw was also Middle Earth itself, which is a wonderful little club up near where I live. We were right up front...like one table-width away from the stage...I could practically smell the front-man's breath from where I was sitting. I loved every second of it. There was not one single song that they played that I did not enjoy. How often does that happen? Seriously?! If you ever get a chance to see The Benders, please go...even if you don't think you like bluegrass. You will like these guys. They're gritty, they're rowdy, they're talented...they're everything live music should, in my opinion.  And that...is all I have to say about that! I hope everyone had a nice Easter...mine was spent raking the yard, but it felt good to get out and rake after being cooped up all winter long. I re-potted some plants and bought a freesia plant, which smells ridiculously good and is gorgeous. I wish it was cold-tolerant enough to grow outside because i'd plant shitloads of it...but i don't think vermont qualfies as "Zone 9"...hahaha!   Anyway...I guess that's it. I'm tired as hell because I woke up very early and have had a frustrating day. I'm trying not to let the bullshit get to me, but the longer i'm awake, the harder it gets. I know, I know...everyone hates their job sometimes...*sighs*  I just wish it didn't have to be all the time.

      that oughta cure what ails me...  I have a headache. I hate my job. Not...you know...in totality...just most of it. And just this week, I think. I'm blaming nature....if you get my drift.   Anyways...so it's only tuesday and this has been a killer week. If I make it to Friday without strangling someone, I'm going to celebrate. I'm going with Becky, Shannon and my uncle (Becky's dad) to see The Benders on Saturday night. Kick ass blue grass to lift the spirits! And beer, too! That's always key...  I watched School of Rock last night. Good flick. Predictable, but still cute. And if that little kid really WAS playing guitar like that, he's going to be the next Eddie Van Halen. Way cool. Made me want to start playing guitar again. Sucks that I just got my nails grown out, too.   I have a HUGE (well ok it's not huge, but it's good sized) bruise on my left leg that I can't determine the cause of. Odd.   I'm so glad that I only have 10 min of work left...*cheers*  I get to go home, crawl into bed, and get up and do this shit alllllllll over again tomorrow...grr!  I would also like to briefly point out that Jon needs to get off his government-salaried ass and post something new on his blog soon...*snickers*. So does Alex...but Alex is just a punk like that, so I won't hold my breath.   Alright...5 min left...time to pack up and blow this popsicle joint! Have a good night!

      Hi. Happy fuckin' Monday.  This is me sitting in front of the computer, wolfing sub-par salad, fantasizing about Cheetos, pepperoni pizza, tiramisu, and absolutely anything else with high saturated fat and little to no nutritional value. Mmmm...this lettuce is SOOO tasty...I just can NOT get enough of it...*rolls her eyes*  I am up to my eyeballs in bullshit...and let me tell you, it's starting to stink. There are not words to describe the stress level that I am at right now, and thus I have booked a 15-minute mental vacation to spend sitting here staring out the window. And eating salad. Icky, tasteless....salad.   There have been 4 occassions (so far. it's only 12.45) today when I have thrown my hands up into the air and yelled "I Quit!". The first time, I didn't really mean it...but the next three, I really did. It seems as though the entire world spent all of last night simply plotting...sitting around, waiting for me to wake up so that it could pounce on me and start to just hump my head mercilessly. And I'm talking like overzealous beagle puppy type head-humping. Don't laugh, now...you all know you've had a puppy at some point in your life, and you've been laying on the floor playing with the puppy and it runs up and starts hammering away at your head like a little machine.  You know what I'm talking about. It's funny, and you know that all puppies do it...but at the same time, it leaves you feeling a little bity dirty...maybe a little used...  Anyway...so that's what my day has been like. Everything I have touched, said, thought about, or even NOT thought about but has crossed my path has turned to utter utter shit. Not even simple shit, either. Complicated, unintelligible, non-detangle-able...SHIT.    And to top it all off, I have salad for lunch. Lettuce. Lettuce should not be considered a food. It tastes like nothing. It contains nothing, except water and a leeeeeeeetle tiny bit of chlorophyl. The thought of taking another bite of that lettuce makes me shiver with hatred...and it makes me think of chocolate, and how wonderful it would be if chocolate had the calorie and fat content of lettuce but tasted like....well...chocolate. Life would be good. But alas...life is not good...because just like my lettuce, lately life is watery, limp, tasteless (if not slightly bitter), a little bit slimy, and just generally deplorable...no matter what kind of dressing I dump onto it.

      The title comes from the song I'm listening to right now, not anything interesting that's going on. I just wanted to clarify that quickly for everyone, lest they believe that, for some reason, things actually HAPPEN in my life. Because that would just be silly.   Listening to: Stevie Ray Vaughn - Greatest Hits.  Wonderful CD...music like this is, to me, about the purest form of rock and roll available. I love everything from the rapid-fire guitar solos to the chugging 12-bar blues type bass line to Stevie's raspy, gravel-laden voice. It makes me want to take up whiskey drinking...at least until I remember how I felt the last time I drank whiskey.  Observing in the parking lot: two men hotboxing a van. The painters working in the building next door take a smoke break every day around 9:45, without fail. I honestly can't imagine that it's regular cigarettes that they're smoking with the windows rolled up tight like that...  Wishing: That I could make myself keep my check book under control and balance it on a regular basis like most normal human beings. As it stands right now, I haven't done it since about the beginning of January. When I finally sit down to do it, it's going to take me like 4 hours just to write everything in. Bad Shelby...BAD.   Craving: another McDonalds hash brown. It's a sickness. I love them. I had to go to the bank this morning before work, so I was right near McDonalds, and I stopped for a coffee and a hash brown. I want another one. And another...and another...they are the epitome of crispy fried potato goodness. Even better than french fries of any persuasion. Hash browns are truly what potatos were created for, in my opinion. When the gods thought up potatos, they were actually thinking of hash browns, and they said "Ok...so what do we MAKE these delectable morsels of saturated fat and sodium out of?" and voila! The Potato!   Regretting: the whole not-staying-in-college thing...as usual. It's pretty much a daily occurence, when I come to work and look around at all the bullshit and paperwork that I have to do, just for paperwork's sake. I'm not saying that if I'd stayed in school I'd be at my dream job right now...but i would be making more money and I'd be a little bit closer to being able to tell the world to fuck itself and just becoming a hermit on a sheep farm, which is what I'd REALLY like to be doing right now. Yes...SHEEP. Deal with it.  Feeling: my foot tingling...because it's asleep. I hate that.   Need to remember: Ilaria's birthday on April 7th...my sweet little munchkin of a niece turns 1!! So exciting!  Also, parents' anniversary on the 2nd, and I should also get my nana a birthday card, seeing as how her birthday was...erm...yesterday...oops!   OK...I need to stop making lists and actually do some work, I guess. Joy and rapture!

      Warning: this is not an interesting post. It was mostly just an excuse to stretch my fingers, because I've been crocheting for a couple hours and my hands feel about 80 years old right now. Hehehehe...:)  Ok, proceed!   Today, I am a crochetin' mo-fo. My mom has always wanted a nice centerpiece for her dining room table, and when I picked up thread crochet a couple years ago, she started bugging me about making her one. If you've never crocheted, then this won't mean much to you...but if you have any idea at all of what is involved with crocheting lace or doilies, you will understand. I'm using a size 7 hook. The head of that hook is 1.5mm wide. Get a ruler and look. That's really f-ing small! I'm not using yarn either here, people. I'm using cotton thread. Yes...like the same gauge of thread you sew with. A little bit thicker, but not much. So...think about how small the hook is...think about how fine the thread is...and consider this: The finished size for the centerpiece pattern I picked out is 36 inches across. That means that by the time all is said and done, I'm going to have to be stitching around the circumfrence of a 3-foot circle. If I was better at math, I'd tell you how big that is in inches...but I wasn't paying attention that day in class.   Anyway...so it's been long and painstaking. I started this just after christmas, with the intention of it being an Easter gift. You know...white frilly things...easter...perfect, right? Easter came and went. Mother's day came and went. Mom's birthday came and went. And here I am, still crocheting this god-forsaken thing. I have, as of right now, 13 rounds left out of 60 total. Don't get me wrong...I love to crochet...and I wouldn't do it if I didn't enjoy it...but sometimes it just seems ENDLESS. But then I spread the piece out and look at the cool design and the way my stitches are all nice and even and bootiful, and I smile. I've spent my whole life looking for something that I'm GOOD at...really good at...and I've finally found it. Too bad it couldn't be something that would make me rich and famous, but hey...I'm a simple girl...no big deal, I guess. I'll see if I can take a picture of it and post it up here when it's done.   Also - I currently have baby afghans up the ying-yang. I just make them for fun even if there are no pending births that I know of. If anyone knows someone who wants / needs a baby afghan, lemme know. I'm going to try to take pictures of the finished pieces I have and make a little "potfolio" type website at some point.   In other news: I am on VACATION as of Tuesday. Take that, SUCKAHHHHHHHHHS!! ;) I don't have anything to do, really...except NOT be at WORK!! HEHEHHHEHE!! ;)

      I thought it was fishy when I called my house to check my messages yesterday and the answering machine didn't pick up. The phone just rang and rang. Odd. The only time the answering machine doesn't pick up is when the power's out. Hmph. I called my mom later in the day to investigate, as I live across the road from her and when I lose power, she usually does, too.   "Hey...did you lose power today?"   "No...why?"   "I called to check my messages earlier, but the answering machine didn't pick up."   "Hmmm...I dunno. When was the last time you paid your power bill?"  I love how any conversation having to do with money automatically becomes snarky with her.   "I paid it like a week ago. It was overdue, but I paid it way before the you-better-pay-this-or-else date. I don't think they would have shut it off because of that..."  "Well, chances are..."  Yeah...chances are...*grumble*   So I get home last night around 9, as per usual. There's normally a little nightlight plugged into the outlet next to my door so I can get into the house without killing myself. The nightlight was out. 'That ain't right...' I thought to myself in the southern redneck twang I often use for my inner monolouge.  I opened the door and reached in for the light switch.   Flick.   Nothing.   Flick....Flick....Flick....flickflickflickflickflick....  Nothing.   Fuckingmotherfuckerpieceofshitgoddamnitalltohellwhatthefuckdoidonow!  There was an envelope from the power company (imagine!) stuck to my door. I ripped it off the door and stomped into the house...in the dark. It's actually kind of comical how when one's got no power, one still tries every light switch in the house, hoping for a miracle. I went into the living room and tried to turn on the lamp, then started swearing again. I looked around. Epiphany!! Look at all those candles on the shelf! Good call...let's get the matches. Wait...the kitchen is pitch dark...where the fuck did I leave those matches? Ok, ok...flashlight. I know there's a flashlight in the kitchen. I just gotta feeeeeeeel around for it...  So I found the flashlight, then found the matches, then lit my candles. I looked at the slip from the power company.   "Attention! You are without electrical service!"  No fucking shit, Sherlock. That explains a lot.   "We have disconnected your power due to non-payment. Arrangements to restore power can be made from 7am to 7pm Monday through Friday by calling this number..."  Now, wait just a cotton pickin' minute, here (see? the redneck again...always in my head...isn't it weird?!)...I PAID the bill!! I know I did!! I have the confirmation numbers because I paid it over the phone! What time do these motherfuckers close? I'm going to call and rip them a new....wait...7am to 7pm. OH GREAT. Looks like it's going to be a quiet night for Shelb...  I stomped back into the kitchen. If I was going to have to sit in the dark, I was at least going to have something to eat to take my mind off things. Opened the fridge...no light. Fridge runs on electricity...and bitch, you ain't got none. Well this is just CUTE. No lights, no tv AND no dinner!! I've been grounded before and had a better time than I had last night! I grabbed a banana and muttered to myself as I went upstairs with my candle and my flashlight. I flopped down on the bed and grabbed the phone. At least THAT worked. I called a friend and told him what happened, and he laughed. "It's happened to everyone at least once, babe...don't feel too bad about it."  He made me feel better. Then he offered to call me in the morning. "Why?" I asked. "Well...you've got no electricity...that means no alarm clock. How you gonna wake up in the morning?"  FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCKKKKKK!!!  "Good point. If you could give me a wake-up call, I'd really appreciate it..."  He laughed at me. I got off the phone, ate my banana, and crawled into bed.   Quiet. Silent, even. You never really realize just how comforting the hum of the fridge or the fan is until it's gone. I could practically count the crickets in the yard last night, I could hear them so well. I rolled over and closed my eyes. Eventually I fell asleep, but it took me a while.   I got my wake-up call this morning, which was a life-saver. I couldn't take a shower, because I had no hot water, so I got dressed and came to work early. I called the power company...turns out they didn't even know my power was off! I was like "what gives?" and the lady said "what do you mean, your power is off?"    "No lights...no hot water...no fridge. O-F-F. OFF!"   "Well did you check the circuits? Did something trip?"   "Nooooo, nothing tripped. There was a pink slip on my door. What's the deal? I paid you!"   "Yes...you did. They shouldn't have shut that off. Sorry about that. I don't know what happened. We'll get that turned back on for you today. Anything else I can do for you?"   Yeah...you could get your shit together and not go around shutting random peoples' power off so that they spend a night in misery and worse, lose everything in their fridges! You could come over and mop up the water all over my floor from my freezer defrosting itself! You could buy me dinner to make up for me going to bed hungry last night! You could call my coworkers and appologize for my ASS being STINKY because I couldn't take a SHOWER this morning because of YOU! You could call my mom and explain to her that while, yes, I have lied to her about things like this in the past, I am in fact telling the TRUTH about this situation...I really DID pay the bill, but YOU guys fucked up. Because you know what? She doesn't believe me...and she WON'T believe me...and it's ALL I'm going to hear about for the next month and a half. Then she'll tell my grandmother, who will tell all my aunts, who will tell all my cousins, and by the next big family gathering, everyone will be laughing and pointing at me for being the family LOSER once AGAIN because obviously I'm stupid and irresponsible and I don't pay my bills on time. Yeah...there's a LOT of things you could do for me, AMY FROM CVPS!!!!

      I mentioned in a previous post about how my mom just shows up at my house and expects to be entertained...or at least treated with some semblance of civility...on really random occasions. This past sunday was one such occassion. Deb commented on my post, saying that she just no longer opens the door if the bell rings and she's not expecting anyone. I proceeded to reply to her comment, explaining thus:  "If I lived in a building with other people that might work, but I have a cottage all to myself. Plus the fact that, at the time, I HAD been on the phone for a good long while and she'd been trying to call me (apparently the call waiting is the first thing to go if you don't pay your Verizon bill, kids...a little PSA for you there...), so it's not like I could fake having been asleep or out for a walk or something..."  ...then I started thinking about my mom, and about some of the stuff she does sometimes. I mean...there's good stuff, like doing my laundry even though I don't live there, inviting me over for dinner on the weekends, keeping my fire going during the evenings in the winter when I don't get home from work until late...those types of things. But...she does some kinda shitty things, too. She has a hard time minding her own business on occassion. Technically, I am an adult...and technically, I am indepedant and self-sufficient.  Technically , I pay my own rent and thus the whole "while you're under MY roof" adage doesn't actually apply to me anymore. She could possibly get away with "...while I'm doing YOUR laundry!!!", but honestly? It just doesn't hold the same clout, really. So...I have a hard time being her friend when she does things like come into my house when I'm not home, go through my mail, and then yell at me because I lied to her about paying my gas bill. Ok...first of all, let's review. My house. My gas. My name on the gas bill. MY HOUSE. MY NAME ON THE GAS BILL. HELLO!! Yes, it was wrong of me to lie to her. Did she really have any business asking about my bills to begin with? Not really...but we'll overlook that for argument's sake. I shouldn't have lied...but at the same time, she shouldn't be just randomly reading my mail. Two wrongs never make a right...you dig?   So, yeah. The whole mail-reading thing is being brought up because on sunday, when she rolled up in my crib all uninvited-like and commenced to try to guilt-trip me into...fuck, I don't even KNOW what she wanted, to be completely honest...but she was laying the guilt on with a fuckin' trowel lemme tell ya. Anyway, when she was there, she sat down at the table, and she was eyeing a pile of mail on my table. The corner of one of the envelopes said "Judicial Bureau" on it. Hellooooooo, speeding ticket! I never told her I got the tickets to begin with, because I didn't want to hear the ensuing "Itoldyousodontyoueverlistentomeimyourmotheriknowthese- thingshowareyougoingtopayitthatwasreallyfuckingstupidyouknowyou- betterhopeidonttellyourfatherbecausethenyourassisgrassandbytheway- youwereneverprettyenoughsmartenoughorcoolenoughformesothisisntreallyasurprise...."  lecture. She didn't say anything about the envelope while she was there. All I can think is that either a) she couldn't see what it said, as she didn't have her glasses on and she's pretty blind without them, or b) she saw it and decided I'd probably just lie to her about it anyway (which i would have) so she's going to come back and look at it herself later when I'm not home. And while she's got her hands on that envelope, she'll more than likely look at all the other ones sitting there...the phone bill overdue by leaps and bounds, the light bill final notice (which reminds me...), the nasty notes from the US Dept of Education wanting to know when I intend to pay on my student loan again...etc. It would just be better for everyone involved if she just wasn't so fucking nosey, really. But what do I do? Start locking my door? She's got a key, somewhere. Stash my shit? Yeah...good idea...except I can't get over the fact that it's MY god damned HOUSE, and therefore she shouldn't be DOING that shit and I shouldn't HAVE to stash anything. Pay my bills like a normal person? Well yeah...there's that...I'm still working on that one. But you see where I'm coming from? I have all these friends who are like "Flaaaah...my mom is my BEST friend...EVER. I don't know WHAT I'd do without her" and I think to myself that yes, I don't know what I'll do without her when she's gone, but god damn....she doesn't really make life very easy for either one of us sometimes.

      Just quickly (is there such a thing with me? Hah!) - in my flutter of general misanthropy earlier, I complete forgot to mention that I watched The Last Samurai last night. SO GOOD!! Such a wonderful movie...very beautiful. Very sad, but also very triumphant and uplifting, if you can get past the sad parts. I started crying about 30 min into the film and sniffled on and off through the whole thing, then broke down sobbing near the end. I won't tell you at what part, assuming you haven't seen the movie yet, but I will tell you that it was when Katsumoto said "They are all perfect". Go rent the movie and see if you don't cry during that part, too!! Seriously, though...it was a very good flick, and I can't honestly figure out how they got away with robbing Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick so blind at the Oscars. Go watch it and tell me if you don't agree.     Also...I got new sneakers this weekend and they are uber-comfy, so I made the mistake of thinking I could just go off on my mile-long walk in them this afternoon, after having only worn them a total of about 2 hours EVER before today. One might say...OUCH. One might also fill the bath tub up with warm water and bath salts and soak one's tootsies for a good long while when she gets home this evening....*grins*  It's amazing just what a difference new, properly fitting shoes can make, though. My walk has never really worked my butt muscles before, but I was feelin' the glutes today when I got back, lemme tell ya!   Oh, and I thought of one more thing to add to the "pisses me off" list. It's kind of stupid and girly, which those of you who know me will know that I detest all things stupid and girly, but here goes: It pisses me off that the fingernails on my left hand are perfect, strong, and I actually have to keep trimming them so that they don't get too long...but the ones on my right hand? Stunted is a good word. They just don't grow. I don't get it! And it makes me mad, because I can paint my left hand up all bootifully, but I look like a friggin' carnie if I go around with just one hand's nails painted...or worse if I try to paint the stunted ones to match!! So what do I do?! Arg!!   That is all...:)

      This is a list of things that piss me off, in no particular order. I decided my blog had been lacking some of my patented brand of acidic negativity, and in service to my 4 loyal readers I will attempt to rekindle some of that herein. Or something.     Things That Generally Piss Me Off     1) People who say they're going to do something, and then don't do it.  And better yet, when they're really hypocritical about it. When they make a big deal from the get-go that one's word is one's bond, and that the most important thing in the world should be living up to one's promises. Then disregard every promise they've made, or have an excuse for every time they've said they were going to do something but didn't do it.    2) Periods of constant rain amounting to more than 24 hours.  There's no need of this. This should happen in November, when I don't want to be outside anyway...hence the song..."Cold November Rain". You never hear songs about the Cold May Rain pelting the earth constantly for a week or more at a time.   3) People who can't shut up.  If it's a true and honest medical condition you have, like Turretts, then yeah...I'm going to cut you some slack. But if it's simply that you love to hear yourself talk, then we're going to have issues. Chances are, I already have issues with you anyway, because I'm a miserable bitch and I don't like many people to begin with, but if you can't control your compulsion to detail every single second of the last 7 episodes of Whosiwhatsit-amoto anime that you watched, then the fur might very well fly. I've covered this several times in the past, I believe. You know...the part about "shut the fuck up to me lest I get violent" rants that I go on occassionally. Yes. Those still stand.    4) Uninvited guests.  Mom, I love you. I honestly do. But sometimes I just like to be alone. Sometimes, I like to do my own thing. If that involves spending an entire sunday lazing in bed, talking on the phone to friends, then that's my business. I pay the phone bill. I pay the rent. Sunday is MY day off. Please don't just roll up in my driveway and expect me to drop whatever I'm doing and want to bond. It'd be one thing if I hadn't seen you in a week, but I spent all day saturday and most of saturday night with you already. My Mom-O-Meter had been fully recharged, and I was good to go until about Wednesday, when I stop by on my evening off. You brought me up to be very independant and self-sufficient, which I appreciate, but it becomes a bit of a double-edged sword when you want to come over and hang out for no reason, and I have things I want to do...or not do, as the case may be. I hope you didn't take it too personally that I sort of ushered you out of the house...I just wasn't in a social mood.    5) Did I mention the whole not doing what you say you're going to do thing?   Because that applies not just to being somewhere on time or fixing something you said you'd fix, but also calling when you said you would, emailing me something that I need that you have that I asked you for very nicely and you said you'd be happy to do, and of course, calling when you said you would. Because it's annoying when people don't CALL when they say they're GOING to.    6) Getting shafted when buying coffee at a place I don't normally go to.  I can get a 24oz coffee at Wings for $1.00. At Cumberland Farms, a 20oz costs a whopping $1.79. I didn't realize this until I got to the counter. I was tempted to leave the coffee sitting there...but I was good and coughed it up. Lesson learned, though.    7) Running out of things to fill up my list because I spent too long going into too much detail on the preceeding items of said list.   'Nuff said.

      So I realized this morning that I haven't posted anything in a while...and apparently neither has anyone else! I go through my little blog list every morning, all excited to read some news...and I get NOTHIN'!!! What's wrong with you slackers?! ;) Nah, just kidding...I'm sure everyone else is as busy as I've been lately.   Random tidbits:   - Had the best weekend in a long time this sat/sun past. No agenda to speak of...made the usual Saturday morning run to Wal-Mart to grocery shop with mom, which was good fun. Spent too much money, but it felt good anyway. Came home, stretched out on lawn in the sun, had me a little nap, got me a little tan...dad came over and helped me put the screens in my windows so that my house was slightly less oven-ish...got cleaned up and headed back to mom's house for dinner saturday night, watched The Rundown (with The Rock!! yee hah!!), which was actually REALLY funny and good, albeit a little dumb in parts because that Stiffler kid just can't help but be a moron, really...came home, hung out, went to bed late, woke up late sunday, did a whole lotta nothin' for most of the day, made a wicked awesome batch of potato salad which I took to mom's for dinner, and then came home and crashed out early. Good stuff. :)  - Hung out with A and S from J&D on Thursday night. Went to S's place, smoked pot...haven't done THAT in a while...woooo!! Was feeling pretty stupid after about 3 hits and genuinely idiotic for the next 2 hours or so, but managed to get home by about 11:30 and it was all good. A spent a lot of time on her cell phone calling boys. S and I spent a lot of time laughing at each other. Both have acted kind of weird since. Makes me wonder if I was more idiotic than I remember, but I don't honestly think so.   - Have finally booked vacation for first week in June, thank you! Cut a deal with the devil involving myself working on 5/31, which is Memorial Day, and taking my holiday time on 6/1 instead, so I can take 6/2 through 6/4 off as well. Right on! I have no idea what I'm going to do, but at least I won't be here!! hehehehe! It will kind of suck to be out that money from 2nd job, as I don't accrue vacation time there, but oh well...it will do me good to not be there for a week!  - Noticed two scary new freckles on my shoulder this weekend that were never there before, so thinking about making a doctor's appointment to have them looked at. I showed mom and she simply said "people get new freckles and moles every day...", and also pointed out that there is no history of cancer of any kind in our family at all...but they still worry me. Am I maybe just a hypochondriac?  - Saved the best for last: I can now almost take my favorite khakis off without unbuttoning / unzipping them, which means it's time to BUY A SMALLER PAIR OF PANTS, BABY!!!!  Heheheeeeeeeeee!!! I have, according to my calculations, lost 2 inches from my waist, 3 inches from my hips, and 2 inches from each thigh as of this morning. I'd tell you how many pounds I've lost, but I don't actually know, because I never weigh myself. I don't really care what I weigh, anyway...I care how I feel. Whether I lost 5 lbs or 20, it doesn't matter, because I feel AWESOME. So...*sticks her tongue out*.... nyyyyyeeeeeeeehhhhhhh!!  hehehehe! ;)

      So...I work with this redneck back-woods old-timer named Gil. He's the sweetest thing going...he really is. He's one of these Old New England types who would literally give you the shirt off his back if he thought it'd help you out. He's always checking the air pressure in my tires, always worrying that I haven't changed my oil lately, wondering where I'm going to get wood for the winter, stuff like that. He's a great old guy, and I think the world of him.   Anyway...Gil makes hard cider...or as he terms it, "rocket fuel". He's always having people over to test it, and he gives a lot of it away. Last fall, I came in with a really sore throat one morning and he told me he had just the thing. He brought in a wine bottle of his rocket fuel, told me to put it in the freezer for an hour or so and get it good and cold, then drink it when I got home. Well, I'll be damned, I only drank half of it, and it knocked me on my ass (which is saying something, as I'm not a small lass, and I've done my share of serious drinking in my day, having no low tolerance level). I crawled upstairs and slept like the dead, but you know what? The next morning, that sore throat was GONE, and I didn't even get a whiff of a cold the rest of the winter.   I was standing there in the shop about two weeks ago, and I was telling Gil that I was planning on company that wednesday night. "What are you gonna feed 'em?" he asked, to which I replied "burgers, I guess. Why?" He just smiled his big, gap-toothed Gil smile, and nodded. I thought to myself that he looked like he was up to something, but other things came up and I quit worrying about it. Later on in the afternoon, he came up to my desk and jerked his thumb back in the direction of my car out in the parking lot. "I put somethin' in there for you...you get it home safe and get it in the fridge before your company comes..." I laughed, and he grinned and wandered off. Sure enough, when I went out to get in the car, there was a Wal-Mart bag in the back seat, encasing a bottle. I had to make some other stops, as I realized during the day that we were having a cook-out and I had no grill, so the bottle rode around in the back seat while I went to Wal-Mart, the grocery store, and several other places. Finally I got home, stuck the bottle in the fridge, and proceeded to open the box that my grill came in. Hmmmm...lotta parts in that box. Hmmm...washers and wingnuts and stuff. Hmmm...no boy around to help me. What's a girl to do? Welp, first order of business was to find that bottle of rocket fuel and pour myself a big glass. 4 or 5 sips of that and it didn't matter that I was using the A wingnuts on the B bolts with the F lock-washers...I was having a grand old time. My company showed up shortly after and helped me put the grill together, but I was fairly worthless after that. They tried the rocket fuel, but decided they didn't like it, so I saved it for myself. I was one silly mo-fo by the time I got to bed that night.   The next day, whilst complaining of a bit of a headache, I pointed out to Gil that I forgot his (now empty) bottle at home. He laughed and said he didn't need it back unless I wanted a re-fill. "Nope...I think I'm ok for a while..." I grinned. Later on, he shuffled into my office again and gestured toward the car. "Hey...I had something in my truck that I was gonna give to Ed down in the Warner shop, but I forgot all about it this morning when I went down. I can't take it back home again, so I stuck it in your car. I figured you'd use it eventually..." and I groaned in protest, but he just laughed and wandered off. When I got out there to go home that night, there sat a gleaming one-gallon wine jug FULL of hard cider on the back seat....  Anybody want to test it out? Drop on by and I'll pour you a glass...I gotta get rid of it...;)

      Morning, all! First, let me say that this morning's trip to the store for coffee went much smoother, mostly because I went nowhere near the coolers. I've been thinking about mature and rational ways to handle the situation, as I feel like ignoring it really wouldn't do me (or anyone else who frequents that store) any good. However, I don't really want to blow it way out of proportion, because that's just sorta silly, too. I think that this weekend I might go in and talk to M, the owner of the store. I grew up with her kids...I've slept over at her house...she's known me all my life. I think she'd understand that I don't want to get anyone into trouble, per se, but that what happened yesterday made me feel uncomfortable to the point that I considered not going to the store anymore. I just think that she should know what goes on in her store, if nothing else.   Anyway...on to more interesting subjects!! You'll see I added a couple new links...One called Belle De Jour, which is a really funny and cool and interesting blog about a real-life (or if she's faking it, she does a great job!) call girl in London. Dirty at times, but entertainingly so...or at least in my opinion...hehehe! There's also a new link for Ashley's live-journal, which is technically called La Belle Danson Regret, but I didn't want to have two Belle's in a row and risk looking like a francophile. ;) Anyway, Ashley is a friend that I work with at my second job. I read her journal because it's always funny, and at the same time very soap-opera-ish because she's 18 and has boy issues.   What else? I have to work all weekend. I'm hoping that my working this weekend will give me time to finish the damnable karoke (or however the fuck it's spelled) list project that I started like months ago. I don't know if I've mentioned it before, but a customer came into the shop wanting some copies of his karoke list (he's a DJ) and he only had it in hard-copy, so he wondered if we could somehow make a digital file out of it so that he'd be able to update it instead of adding new pages every time. Turns out the only way that can happen is for someone to sit down and input all 150 pgs of it into something like Excel. I, at the time, still had brakes to pay for and speeding tickets to finance, so I thought that it sounded like easy money. I told my boss that I'd do it if the company wanted to pay me for it. Well. Wasn't that the mistake of the century. This thing has become the bane of my existence. It is NEVER ENDING. I worked on it the whole of both 5-hour shifts I had weekend before last, and I'm still only about half-way. The guy's being really nice about it...he could be a dick, but he's being patient....but I just want it done and out of my hair immediately!  So that's my plan for the weekend, since I have to be in work, and nothing ever happens there on the weekends. I will just type my little fingers to the bone and hopefully get the dreaded karoke list over and done with.   Also, found out yesterday that I have until 6/22 to pay my speeding tickets, as I was good and filed an extension. Woo hooooooo!! Why pay today what you can put off until JUNE, baby!! Good thing, too...I still have to suss out rent, car payment AND phone bill this month. What ever happened to trading chickens and beads for things? How many chickens do you think my Impala is really worth? *giggles*

      I had an experience this morning. I went to the local family owned gas-and-grocery joint that I always go to, because I'd rather support someone I've known my whole life, even if their gas is 3 cents higher a gallon. I filled my car up, went in and walked down the aisle to get a gallon of water for work. "Mr. J" (who used to work in the deli at this store but had some weird blood clot in his brain a few months ago, had it operated on, and something went wrong...he's fucked up now...he can't walk right, he slurs really bad, and his face looks like the Phantom of the Opera...sans mask...) was pulling the milk forward in the cooler, which is directly adjacent to where the bottled water is kept.  I was minding my own god damned business, opening boxes, looking for a gallon of water that wasn't Distilled (because no one had pulled any out), and this voice comes from inside the cooler (someone was in there stocking it). He said  "Mr. J...Hey, Mr. J! Look!! Look!!" and I saw Mr. J out of the corner of my eye turn around and look at me, then turn back, and he goes to the person in the cooler "Man, she'll sit on you...she'll thump you, man..." and I just stood there, looking at him like "Umm...HI?! The fat girl has EARS, you fuckin' fool..."  but I didn't say anything. I went to the counter, I paid for my gas and shit, and I said to C, the lady working the counter: "I don't know who you have working in the cooler this morning, but you should prolly tell them to watch their mouth when they're right there where people can hear them, because they sound pretty fucking ignorant and stupid when they run their mouth to Mr. J right there in front of everyone..." and she was just like "Ohhhh....sorry...I don't know who it is...."  And I was like "whatever...just tellin' ya..." and I left.   I don't think it even bothers me so much that either of them said what they did, so much as it bothers me that I don't fuckin' walk in there and pick on Mr. J for being crippled, you know? He's fucked up...and I don't walk in there and point and laugh and be like "Hey...look at the guy who used to be normal and now he's fuckin' useless and the only reason he's still got a job is because M, the owner of the store, is a good person and is taking care of him...look at him...he can't even fucking walk normal...he can hardly talk...he looks like he's been run over by a fucking truck....what a piece of shit loser..."  It makes me mad that people don't look at themselves before they open their big fucking mouths and say shit. No one is fucking perfect...not even close...and yet they feel like they can just stand there and point and laugh at every person who's different than them. I don't go around calling black people niggers...I don't call islamic people towel-heads, or asian people slant-eyes...I don't think of gay people as fags and dykes...I don't laugh at people in wheelchairs or pick on people I see with Downs Syndrome...so why the fuck do I deserve to get laughed and pointed at because I'm fat? Yeah, you could use the argument that it's my own damn fault that I'm fat...that it's a choice that I made...which is bullshit in and of itself, but you know what? It doesn't even matter. Just because I don't choose to run 6 miles a day, just because I like ice cream more than I like legumes and cauliflower, just because I wear a size 24 and you're a god damned size 6, so fucking what? It doesn't make me any less human. It doesn't give you the right to treat me like a piece of shit....to talk about me like I'm not standing right there....to think that just because I'm overweight, that I obviously have no respect for myself and therefore you can say anything you want about me and I'll just take it.   I don't HAVE to take it. I walked away this morning because I'm rational. I'm mature. I'm non-violent. Because I'm smart. I could have walked over, hauled off, and decked the both of them...but I don't do that, because I know shit like that lands people in jail. I WANTED to kick both of those idiots' teeth in so bad that it made my heart pound in my chest and it took my god damned breath away...but I know better. I took their bullshit and stowed it away in my "an elephant never forgets" file, I took my obese ass out to my car, and I drove away.   I remain the bigger person...any you look at it.

      Sooooo...I've been to some parties in my time. And I've been to some pretty redneck parties, at that. The party I attended on Saturday night, however, managed to rise above and beyond any and all redneck functions I have ever had the (somewhat dubious) honor of attending. Let me fill you in.   Last year, my cousin Becky turned 21. Most of her friends were not old enough to go out drinking as is customary on one's 21st birthday, so we just went out for dinner instead. This year she decided that for the 22nd birthday, we were going to make up for that...and then some. Everyone's old enough to drink now, and none of us have really gotten old enough to know better yet...so the party planning began in earnest about a month ago. It went through several incarnations before Becky decided on a garage-based Beer Pong tournament of sorts. Many were invited. 130 Jell-O shots were made. The garage was cleaned out. Beer was bought by the case. The Beer Pong table was set up. I rolled in at just about 6pm. Being a family member and thus an automatic VIP, I was able to get in early. There were 6 of us there...we hung out, drank some beer, ate some Jell-O shots, played some Beer Pong, listened to some Johnny Cash.   Flash forward to 8pm. All 6 of us are feeling quite silly at this point. The Beer Pong competition has gotten intense. Rules are being formulated and scribbled on the table in pink marker. Lots of swearing. We've moved on to AC/DC and Def Leppard.   Forward again to 9pm. Stilllllllll just the 6 of us. Stillllllllll feeling silly. Stillllll playing the Beer Pong like it hasn't already gone out of style. "Do you think anyone's going to show up?" Becky asks me, her big blue eyes showing genuine concern...and genuine inebriation.  "Yeah, I think so...we told everyone to come after dark...it's just after dark now. It'll be ok...they'll come." We then take the added initiative to pull up the tiki torches we'd set into the lawn near the house, and trot them down to the middle of the drive-way, which is a long road up the side of a hill that is in plain view of the main road. Plan being that the tiki torches would guide guests to the par-tay.   Forward to 9.15 and the first vehicle full (and I mean full) of guests arrives. Loud, and already mostly drunk. Right on. Another car comes bombing up the drive shortly there-after. Now this...THIS is a party!   Forward to 9.30, and there's a steady stream of traffic coming up the driveway. One car after another parks on the lawn in a perfect row. All trucks and SUV's, except for my car. I didn't really know what to think of that at the time.   So, at the height of the festivities, there were 45 people strong in and around the garage. Drinking, yelling, laughing, dancing, playing Beer Pong, and just generally acting quite riotous. Again, being a VIP, I was allowed entrance into the house, where several of us kept finding ourselves, seeking refuge from generally obnoxious people. Seems like the more drunk I get, the more obnoxious everyone else gets. Funny, that. But anyway...so yeah. The 130 Jell-O shots lasted maaaaaaybe an hour once everyone got there. I know that I had 5. I only wanted 3. The other two were forced on me. I swear. Then out of nowhere, there was broken glass in the driveway. Someone had backed over a beer bottle. That was the beginning of the end for me. I helped clean up the glass...I had stopped drinking about an hour before and wasn't feeling any too sloshy. I drank lots of water and ate some stuff to try to soak up some of the alcohol in my stomach (I don't think it works, but a bunch of drunk people were telling me to do it, so I did!). I finally got around to going home, and made it with no problems at all, but it turns out I missed the girl-on-girl fight (not over a man, thank god!) which turned into WWE Smackdown in the yard, I'm told. Just for extra added redneck bonus points, the people fighting were sisters. Classic! I guess that was the only rumble of the evening...and I'm actually a little bit glad I missed it. Given my stature and attitude, I tend to be looked at as "security" in times like that...and I really don't think I'd have enjoyed getting beat down by those two!  So...all in all, it had a slow start, but turned into a redneck paradise. I was glad to get home and sleep in my own bed, though...with visions of Hank Williams and John Deere tractors dancing in my head.   You're all invited to the next one!!!! ;)

      "Cupid works for the devil, be suspicious if he cries... you know, sex is usually good yeah, but it ain't always right. Chocolate is a Band-Aid no matter what they say. Shoes don't stretch... and men...don't...change..."  I can't remember who sings that song (it's a country song), but I like it. And I agree with it. Except, I've had shoes that stretched...but other than that, she's pretty dead-on.   I want to be mad at him for something. It would make things easier. It would make things hurt less. It would take the sting out of his saying that, basically, he doesn't think about the future...with me, or otherwise.  For someone who claims to care about me so much and for so long, I don't understand how he can be so ambivilent toward the future. "Be thankful for today" he says. Yes, that's a wonderful point, and I often do take my days for granted with working all the time and worrying about shit that ought not be worried about yet. But...at the same time...if you're never looking ahead and having some little seed of hope for the future, then what is there to work toward, really? What is there to throw yourself behind? What is there to be passionate about? And why can't he understand why his apparent ambivilence hurts me?   I don't think I'll ever understand men. I think I might stop trying.

      I might possibly have too much time on my hands today. ;) Please keep in mind that I never said I was GOOD at song-writing. And read it in kind of a B.B. King-esque blues style...as that's how it sounded in my head.  "Air Conditioning Blues"  it's cold in my office feels like an igloo so cold in my office my toes are turnin' blue.  The air conditioner up there blows directly on my head skin's so chilly to the touch you'd think that I was dead...  ch: Oh, I got the blues... the too cold in my office blues. air conditioning's got the best of me. Yeah, I got the blues... the way-too-cold-in-here blues... Wish that A/C would just let me be...   Can't get away from it no matter how I try desk's too heavy to move so cold i'd like to cry... I know when it gets hotter I'll appreciate it more,  but today it's only 60 out don't need cold air no more.  ch.   gettin' hard to concentrate all I can think about is heat what I wouldn't give right now just for a warmer seat.  Oh, that A/C just keeps on blowin' cold air right down my neck teeth chatterin' like a chipmunk my god, it's cold as heck...

      Once a week...what a slacker I am!   Here's the quick run-down, as I'm expecting company of a boss-like nature any moment now...;)  - Worked over the weekend...really boring. Spent the whole time trying to finish the damnable Karaoke (finally learned how to spell it!) Project, as Mr. Karaoke decided to call up Thursday of last week and say "Hey is it done?" to which I replied "Well, no...because you called and told me to hold off on it because you weren't going to have the money...so...I held off on it." "Well, can you have it done friday?" "Uhhhhh...sure!" which was the dumbest thing I EVER could have said, because there's NO fucking way on god's green earth I'm going to be able to get it done by then. ARG! So anyway, I spent the weekend stressing about that, and working on it when I was at work.   - Went in to 2nd job last night to find out that the Contact Center (which is where I work...) is CLOSING due to the company having financial issues. That means 15 full-time and 2 part-time (me included) employees are going to be without jobs. They gave us 2 weeks notice. Fuckin' sucks. I feel really bad for the full-timers. It's not like that place was my bread and butter, you know? It's $100 a week that I pretty much count on, but it's not my whole livelihood. There's a lot of good people there (and a couple scummy ones) that are going to be out of work, and that blows.   - been having weird-as-fuck dreams the last couple nights. Sunday night I dreamt that I had to save kittens...dozens of kittens...from an old barn that was unsafe. It was cold out, and I didn't want them to freeze, so I went around picking them up, and I was really frustrated that I could only carry like 10-12 at a time and had to keep going back for more. And then last night, I dreamt that I was getting married, but in the dream I couldn't actually remember who I was marrying!! I had a suspicion that it was my friend Adam from elementary school, but I couldn't really be sure. Also, I had to find an extra invitation to the wedding so I could determine what time I was supposed to be there...and I don't think I ever did really get there, as I remember looking at my watch and seeing that it was 3:45 and the thing was supposed to start at 3:30. I couldn't find half of the outfit I was supposed to be wearing to the ceremony, either...but I spent hours trying on all different kinds of underwear to wear UNDER the outfit...that I couldn't find!   - So far this morning, Gil has brought me a gigantic dill pickle ("Have A Pickle!!" is his favorite saying...) which was REALLY sour but really good...and a half a bag of gummie spearmint leaves candy. He's so weird....I love him.   And now my boss is here so I have to go. :)

      Here are some random things that I think are worth confessing, for whatever reason. If I was a dinosaur, I would be that one with the walnut-sized brain...so bear with me, here.   - I am addicted to Pyramids solitaire on Yahoo. Once I start playing I can not stop. I am the same way with poker. I feel it would be unwise to ever make a trip to Vegas.   - I sunburnt myself on purpose over the weekend. I want to be tan. I used to get SO tan when I was little and I never burnt, but it's almost like the native american 1/8 of my blood has somehow dissipated in the past 15 years.   - I drink wine on weeknights. Not just a glass. If I open a bottle of wine, I will inevitably drink the entire thing. Rare is the bottle of wine that lasts more than a day in my house. Which is not to say that I go THROUGH a bottle a day...just that when I do buy it, it doesn't last.   - I hate the way some people laugh, and that makes me feel kind of evil in a bad way. Laughing is a happy thing...people should enjoy other peoples' laughs...but there are some laughs (one specifically that I can hear right now, in fact) that drive me bonkers.   - I swear way too fucking much. You know this. I just thought it bore repeating.   - I want a cigarrette. Just sometimes...not all the time. They're killing my mother...and yet, sometimes...sometimes I really want one. I only smoke socially, and even then rarely...but on days like these, I have bouts of obsessing over Camel Lights.   - When I do smoke, I will ONLY smoke Camel Lights or Parliament Lights (heretofore known as P-Funks, due to Jamie).  Marlboro Lights made me REALLY fucking sick once so I can't even stand to look at them. No joke.   - I've been slacking on my walking. I only went once last week, and haven't gone at all this week yet. Strangely, I've still managed to lose 2 lbs.  - I have irrational panics about spiders sometimes. My imagination totally runs away with myself, and I find myself sitting there trying to shake thoughts of gigantic hairy arachnids from my brain. It usually happens about once a day. I don't think that's normal.   - I try to always remain very cool and collected and laid back on the outside, but on the inside, there's almost always some sort of worry gnawing in the pit of my stomach. Often it's the above-mentioned spiders.   - I would like to try to write horror stories some day because I seem to be able to imagine the most god-awful stuff at the drop of a hat, but I'm afraid that I might scare myself right into insomnia, and I've been there before...it ain't fun. Then again, if I could make the money Stephen King makes, FUCK SLEEP!! ;)  - I write 100% of the stuff on this blog while I'm at work because both my jobs bore me to tears and I dwell on how much of a waste of time they are if I don't do something (ie: write) to keep my mind off of it.   - My checkbook is totally, perfectly, completely BALANCED as of noon today, for the first time in at least a year. Let's put it this way...before I made this last attempt at balancing it, the last time I had written anything down in the register was March. OUCH. Online banking ROCKS, though...I highly recommend it.   - It is time to go the fuck home, bitches. Seezya!!! ;)

      There's a person I used to be more than friends with...a very long time ago. We've tried to remain friends, but he did not take it well when I moved on. I'm not sure if he just expected me to never find anyone else again and thus be available whenever he felt he wanted to take advantage of our "friendship", or what...but regardless...he's fairly bitter and quite vocal about his dislike of the person I'm now with, even though he's never met him and doesn't have the slightest clue what he's like. I must admit, I try to avoid talking to this person when possible, simply because I am not a confrontational type of person and I do not enjoy having to state my views and justify my choices over and over again to anyone, let alone someone who thinks he knows me like the back of his hand. Occassionally however, I get into a conversation with this person for whatever reason, and the topic inevitably turns to a) how much of a loser the guy I'm interested in now must be, or b) what I still have of his that I should send back to him, and why I haven't sent it back yet. I haven't sent it back yet mostly because I am NEVER home when the post office is open...I leave before it opens in the morning and I'm back well after it's closed at night. I get my mail once a week on saturday mornings...and yeah, I COULD just slap some stamps on it and send it during one of those trips, but frankly, I often forget. Out of sight, out of mind. And also...what I have of his that he wants back is something that seems fairly insignificant to me. I have no USE for it, certainly...so it's not like I'm keeping it so that I don't have to buy one of my own...but it's really just something that I can't imagine him really desperately needing or wanting on a daily basis, other than out of sheer stubborn-ness. And I will admit, I'm being fairly stubborn myself by avoiding sending it back...but my point is that while he claims he wants to still be friends, he spends the better part of every conversation we have (which have been few and far between the last 6 months) either bringing up the item I have that he wants back, the boy that I love that he's decided to hate, or the fact that I don't know what I'm missing by not being with him...and he ends every conversation saying basically that he doesn't care WHAT I do...that he just wants me to be happy. Right. Like fighting with and losing a friend will make me happy.   So my question is this: I've explained myself 8 ways to Sunday with this guy...I've tried every possible angle I can think of to make him see that I've moved on...that I'm not secretly in love with him still...that I am commited to this person that I am now with. What now? Do I give up? This person really WAS one of my closest friends for almost 5 years. Even when we weren't together in a boyfriend-girlfriend sense, we were still very close. He's always been very much like a brother to me...a brother I never had, always wanted, and don't want to lose. I don't want to just give up on him as a friend...but I feel like he's being overly stubborn, and not a small bit manipulative in the way he plays his cards during some of our conversations. I also feel like he's just plain in the wrong. He tells me I have a negative outlook, that this guy doesn't make me as happy as he did, that I can never make that relationship work...and none of that is right at all. I'm a very positive person as a whole. I know you guys don't always see that here, because this is sort of my bitch-fest place...but those of you who know me in person know that I am, on the whole, a positive person. And in regards to being happy with my relationship, you know what? All relationships have their bumps and rough patches. It's what happens outside of those rough patches that makes it worth sticking with it. No one is perfect...myself included.   Sooooo...I am tempted to just dig out what's rightfully his, send it back to him, and then leave it alone and just wait to see if he tries to come back and apologize for the way he's been treating me. If he doesn't...then it's his loss. If he DOES...then maybe we can try to fix what's broken and be friends again. Another part of me thinks that I should send him what's his and write a nasty fuck-off letter to go with it...but I don't think that would solve anything. Even if it's not a nasty fuck-off letter, I don't think that telling him never to call or email me again would be a positive move...but there's also no promising that he'll have an attitude adjustment once he gets his item back. I'm just kind of interested in what you all would do in such a position.

      ...the highly anticipated, grossly over-rated...VACATION UPDATE! Don't all let your held breaths out in one big collective "whoosh", now!   What I Did On My Vacation:    - Got rained on for the first three days, like raining was going out of style. Cold, constant, soaking rain.   - Watched many movies due to lack of gardening weather. Movies included:  Return of the King  (two thumbs up - Viggo was his usual hot-as-shit self, and some tear-jerking moments rounded out the Tolkein love-fest),  Love Actually  (two thumbs up - if you've spent any time watching movies with me at all, you know my opinion of Hugh Grant...which is that he can do no wrong...ever. Cute movie even without the Hughster...but even better because of him),  Big Fish  (two thumbs up - a little confusing in the beginning, but Tim Burton is the man, as usual...and it's pretty hard to beat Ewan McGregor and that goofy little-boy grin he has), aaaand...I can't remember what else. I watched some sucky ones...I just can't remember them. Probably because they sucked!  - Woke up one morning with a massive headache, and realized that the house smelled funny. Not able to place the smell, I got up, wandered downstairs in my jammies, and noticed that the pilot lights were out on my stove. Hmmm...must be that propane tank really ISN'T bottomless! I was sorta expecting it anyway, and I had the money to pay for some more, but I wasn't really expecting to wake up with carbon monoxide poisoning or something similar and equally as distateful. So I went around and opened up all the windows (even though it was 50 degrees), called the gas company, then realized that...oh balls...I'm out of checks! So I had to get dressed, run to the bank, take cash out of the bank with my ATM card, go to the store, buy a money order, race back home...and sit on my hands and wait for the guy to come fill my tank. Vinnie (I shit you not...I don't make these things up...) finally shows up, wearing tattered jeans and a flannel shirt, smelling of Marlboros and body odor strong enough to make your eyes sting...and he fills my tank. He then comes to the door. "Hi...here's the money I owe...can you light my pilots for me?". Vinnie's a big guy...a scary guy...and once he opened his mouth, I realized...not a very smart guy. So he shuffles in, bitching the entire time about how lighting pilots is not his JOB, and then stops in the living room. I point down at the grate in the floor. "That needs to be lit, too." "Well how do you light it?" "Uhhh...I'm not sure. It's never gone out since I've been here. I think you have to go down in the cellar to get at the back of the unit." Vinnie looked at the grate, then at me, then to the trap door in my kitchen floor which hides the creaky and spider-filled stairway down to the root-cellar of a basement that I have, and back at me. "I'm not lighting that." He started to walk away. "Wh..wh...what do you MEAN, you're not lighting it?" He turned around to look at me. "I'm -NOT- lighting it. Your stove, yeah...your oven, yeah...but I'm not crawling around in anybody's god damned basement for nothing. You call service. That's what they're there for." I just stood there, blinking. "But...but...is it going to LEAK propane into my HOUSE because it's not LIT?" I asked his back as he lumbered out the door. "Not so much that you'll notice. I'll radio a service guy to come light it this afternoon. Have a good day." and he was gone. So the service guy and his (I must admit very young and cute) apprentice showed up at my house an hour later, and just pulled the grate out of the floor in the living room and McGuyvered a matchstick, a telescoping pointer thingy and a rubber band into a makeshift lighter to reach down into the heater and light the pilot. It took all of 3 minutes. And no one had to visit the spider farm that is my basement. Imagine! The cute one kept looking around my little barn and saying what a nice little place it was, too. I was so happy that everything was lit that I almost wanted to offer them a beer after all was said and done...but I was a little nervous that they were the types who'd actually take it! ;)  - Went to the town office to pick up a dump pass for my dad, and proceeded to be annoyed several times over when the town clerk asked me not once but twice what degree I ended up with. I didn't end up with a degree, dipshit...I went to college for a year and had a freak-out and I didn't go back. "Yeah...I heard a lot of people who go to that college you went to don't ever finish..." She smiled obliviously as I snatched the dump pass from her and stalked off.   - Had a scary tires issue with my car in which the wheel was shaking violently and when I stopped, there was a strong burning smell and smoke coming from my front tire. I shimmied on over to the mechanic, as I had to be there to get my oil changed and my summer tires put on anyway, and He couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. He told me one of the brake calipers must have just been jammed from a pebble or something. Ooooookay...so...will it ever do it again? "Maybe..." he says. Ooookay...so is it safe to drive? "Well, not if it keeps doing it..." he says. So what the fuck, dude? "Well bring it back if it keeps doing it and I'll see what I can figure out." Oh GREAT. It seems to me that it generally costs like $150 right off the bat just for a mechanic to "figure" anything out. Anyway...so I left my baby off, he changed the oil and the tires, and when I called to see what the bill was, he said that two of my summer tires were no good because they were too worn, which was news to me...but he said he had a couple of used tires sitting around that he'd "treat me right" on. Ohhhhh boy. So I asked for a total, and he said he did not have it yet. Myself, still being out of checks due to my stupid-ass credit union and the stupid-ass holiday weekend (and my stupid ass not remembering to send the slip in when I was getting low to begin with...), then had to hit the ATM again, yank out as much cash as it would let me because I didn't know the actual amount of the bill, and had my mom drive me up to the mechanic so I could pick up my car. Turns out it was $86.50. I had $87 even, so it all worked out ok. The scary tire thing has only happened once minorly since, so I haven't been back to see Toolbarn Ted yet. That's seriously his name. Ted runs The Tool Barn. I'm telling you...I don't make this shit up!!   - Sun finally came out so I planted 6 basil plants, 4 tomato plants, and 2 window boxes full of nasturtiums which already have TONS of blooms, so I'm psyched! The guy told me they love crappy dry soil...and seeing as how I am the world's WORST plant water-er, this works well for me.   - laid out in the sun and got a killer tan along with several scary ant bites. Ant bites aren't scary to normal people, but I'm the one freak on God's green earth who is allergic to ANTS, of all things...so when I get bit, the thing swells up to 4 times normal size and pulses with its own heartbeat for a couple hours, then itches like fuck for a couple days, then goes away.   ....and I think that's pretty much it! Despite how it sounds, it was a pretty quiet, relaxing vacation, once I got over the guilt factor of being home when everyone else was at work. I felt like when you're a kid and you fake being sick so your mom lets you stay home, and you're supposed to be sleeping, but you watch TV all day long. Or when you fake sick from work and then get all paranoid about leaving the house because you're afraid someone will see you and get your ass fired....hehehe!  Anyway...so this is way too long already and I only have 7 minutes left of work for tonight, so I guess I'll wrap this up. If you've actually gotten this far, give me a Red Neck Woman "HELL YEAH!!"  ;)

      just quickly...I know, I owe you all a vacation update...and I'm working diligently on that, I swear...but I just wanted to say that while I DO feel a little bit bad for people who have had details of their lives that they didn't necessarily want to share smeared across their blogs by uber-vindictive exes...I gotta admit...dirty laundry makes for interesting reading....*giggles evily*  Back later w/ vacation updates!

      Oh. My. Gods.  I am so, so, SO effing bored.   And by bored, I mean...BIZ-ored.   I can't even begin to convey the atrocious and mighty depth and breadth of my boredom. There just are not words to describe it. It is unfathomable.   I was really busy this morning, and I think it spoiled me. I busted ass, I multi-tasked, I was a shining star of productivity and efficiency. The time sailed by. I looked up once and it was 9:15. I looked again and it was 12:30. I love when that happens, I really do. But alas, the joy was not to last. The work dried up at about 12:45. I tapped the last stack of papers on my desk, making them all neat and tidy. I pulled out the folder that they belong in, and placed them lovingly therein. I sat back and sighed contentedly as I observed my now-cleared-off workspace...and I became instantly uneasy. It was too early in the day to be so...so...so...FINISHED. It felt wrong. I looked around. No billing to do, no deposit to make, no payables to post, no more checks to cut...not even any filing. NOTHING.   I work two jobs, not so much because I NEED the money (at least not right now), but more because I can't deal with doing nothing, even at home. I like being busy. Not balls-to-the-wall, we're-never-going-to-get-this-done-in-time busy...but I am, quite honestly, the type of person who is happy to work through lunch, as long as there's stuff to do. I have had at least a part-time job since I was 12 years old. The two times in my life that I did not have a job (during the first semester of college when I didn't have a car, and for a 3-month period after I got fired from a job that I absolutely loved but was not very good at), I was off my rocker within a week. Depressed, anxious, unhealthy...and just WEIRD. I literally did not know what to do with myself.   You also may have noticed that I have the attention span of a gnat. If you put me in a room with a computer and internet access, and 2 hours of free time, I can guarantee you that I will be climbing the walls and begging to be let out within 45 minutes. I shit you not. I just can't take it. There is nothing on the internet that can hold my attention for more than about 15 seconds. I will do the same thing if you lock me in my house for 2 hours, assuming the house is already clean and you've taken away my sewing or crochet gear. I just can't handle it. I need to be doing SOMETHING with my hands and my mind...even if it's typing stupid nonsense blog posts that I never end up posting...or I will flip out.   So today...when the work ran out...when I could see the minutes seeping by like a trail of sticky slug-slime...when I caught myself tapping my toes in my shoes nervously and twiddling my hair and almost, ALMOST biting my fingernails...I had to come here and start typing absolute jibberish to keep me from lapsing into a complete hyper-bored-ism coma.  But now it is time to leave...time to pack up and shuffle off to my second job...where I can at least sit and stick labels on disconnection-notice postcards and feel like I'm DOING something....!!!   Have a good weekend, all!

      I have, once again, managed to physically break myself.   I went to Becky's last night to spend some time with her because she and her boyfriend are having some issues, and she wanted to talk about it. She and I walked 3 1/2 miles last night. Non-stop. Granted, we were talking the whole time and not going terribly fast (took us about an hour)...but for someone (ie: me) who is only used to going like a mile or so at a time...it was a long way. Becky has a 7 mile loop that she usually does, so 3 1/2 wasn't too big of a deal to her. I did really well until about the last half-mile. I could feel the skin on my heels just shredding against my socks...it wasn't good. My legs didn't get tired, and my feet didn't hurt, but the blister thing was a sudden and very unpleasant realization. So...I gritted my teeth and dealt with it until we got to her driveway, then I pulled my sneakers off and walked in the grass (in my socks...sorry mom!) the rest of the way up the hill. When I pulled my socks off, parts of my heel came of with them. Purty gross. Then this morning I woke up, got out of bed, and pretty much every joint in my body cracked and popped all at once. When did I get old? I mean, seriously!! I'm only 24, people...why do I feel 80?!? I'm sick of it. Anyway...the walk, though possibly slightly excessive in hindsight, was good, even though the cause of the walk (that being the relationship problems with Becky) was sad.   We also watched a super-good movie called In America. It's about an Irish family that moves to NYC, and all the issues they have and stuff that happens to them. It's very sad in places, and very funny in others, and it's just generally a very beautiful, sweet, hopeful movie. It doesn't come across as your typical "feel good" movie at all, but you do end up feeling very good at the end. Highly recommended!!

      I had the opportunity to go see The Benders again this weekend at Middle Earth. Fantastic, as usual! They rocked the house. No fiddle player this time, but they were still wonderful. For those of you not familiar, The Benders are a local (ish...) bluegrass band who are definitely my favorite live-music act ever. You know how lots of times you'll buy a CD and listen to it, and the music is great, and then you go to a live show thinking you're going to get the same quality of music but you're left really disappointed? The Benders are the exact opposite of that. Their CD's are great...but they're 50 times better live. And no, it's not just because I have a gigantic crush on the banjo player, thank you. He makes this face when he's really getting into what he's singing, see...and it's just...well...nevermind. *grins* Anyway - it was a good show, and I highly recommend that you all look them up, listen to some of their stuff, maybe buy a cd, and definitely catch a live show if they come to your area. Their schedule can be found on www.bendersband.com.    I was going to try to restrain myself in regards to bitching about a certain episode that occured at the show this weekend...but I can't seem to make myself. So, here goes. I met my cousin Becky, her little sister Tyler, and my uncle and his friend at Middle Earth around 9pm on friday night. Our friend Jamie was supposed to be meeting us there with her "date", which we were not supposed to refer to as her "date" because technically, it wasn't supposed to be a "date" situation. This might have stemmed from the fact that this kid (whose name is Ben) has a girlfriend of 5 years, who we're not sure knew exactly where he was or what he was doing that night. Anyway...that's neither here nor there. Well, it is...but whatever. So Jamie and Ben show up like 5 min before the show starts, and it's all good. We sit, we sip beers, we chit-chat. I like Jamie. She has issues, but don't we all? She's a sweet girl, but she really lets people take advantage of her a lot. Anyway, she and Becky and I basically grew up together (they're 2 years younger than me), so I'm fond of her. So we're all sitting there, and she's introducing us to this Ben kid (who's 28...4 years OLDER than me...SO not a kid...) and he's funny. He seems fairly quick-witted. A little squirrely, maybe...but not bad. So the show finally starts, and we're at a table RIGHT up front...we're practically on stage. They do a couple songs, everyone is happy. Ben is talking a lot to Jamie, but whatever. He'll settle, I figure. They do a couple more songs. Ben is still talking. Loudly. Instead of leaning over to talk into Jamie's ear so she can hear, he just yells louder. I was getting a little embarassed for him...but I kept my mouth shut. Another song comes and goes, and then there's some chatting onstage while people tune and re-tune, etc. Ben mentions that he wants to dance. There are tables right up to the edge of the stage. There is no dance floor. All the tables are occupied. The whole place is FULL. That doesn't stop him. First he gets up and goes out front to ask the owner, Chris, if he can move some tables. "Move the tables at will, dude..." is supposedly the response he gets. That was the wrong thing to tell this kid, as I'm sure Chris later realized. Anyway, so Ben comes back, and he tells us that Chris said it's ok to move the tables, and he starts picking up our drinks, moving them to another table over on the side. The band has started another song by this point and they're trying to play while all this commotion is going on. Ben goes to grab my beer and I give him a "Do you really want to die, motherfucker?" look. He's like "Come on...let's move the table so we can dance!!" and I say "No. This table is staying. If you want to move other tables and dance over THERE, go ahead...but this is where I'm sitting, and I don't want to move." So he shrugs, and wanders over to the other tables up front. Mind you, while the band is still playing. Totally rude. He sits down at one table with an older hippy couple at it...they're game to move their table. He goes to the next table beside us. Another older couple. The wife seems sorta hippy-dippy, but the guy is all business. We couldn't hear the conversation, but it wasn't going well for Ben. The guy wouldn't look at him, kept shaking his head, saying what looked like "no fucking way" over and over again. So Ben comes back to our table. Few more songs go by. Finally, he gets up and goes over to the corner where the hippy couple are sitting, and they start moving tables. He didn't wait for the song to end...he didn't wait to do it in between sets like a normal person....he just started moving shit right there in the middle of the show. I seriously could have killed him. I have been that person on stage who is trying to sing or play while fucktards in the audience are screwing around like that. It's increadibly rude, and very distracting. People think that just because the music THEY hear is loud, it means that it's that loud on stage too, but it's not. The sound goes AWAY from the stage...the only way you can hear yourself on stage is from the monitors, which aren't usually all that loud. When you've got some idiot milling around 3 feet in front of you, laughing and yelling and moving furniture...well...they were nicer about it than I would have been, is what I'm trying to say.   Anyway, so Ben got the tables moved and a few people danced, but most of us just sat there like adults. Ben not only is rude, but he's a bad dancer. And a heckler. Not so much a "you suck!! Play some Skynrd!!" heckler, but more of a heckler in the sense that every little comment that the band made to the audience or worse, amongst themselves, Ben had a really audible reply for. He just couldn't keep his mouth shut. They took a break shortly after the table-moving happened, and Jamie and Ben went out for a smoke. We went with them because we had nothing else to do. The conversation was kept fairly neutral for about 10 minutes, and then the older hippy couple came out and walked past us. Ben said something like "Oh, you can't leave yet!!" and the lady laughed, and said "No, we're just going for a breath of fresh air." TO WHICH BEN REPLIED (and I'm not making this up) - "Yeah, gonna go spark one up, huh?"   I could have died. And I don't mean by laughing. I was mortified. The lady just giggled and the guy kind of smiled uneasily, and they disappeared around the corner. Then, not 2 seconds later, the OTHER older couple (hippy-dippy and Mr. Business) came out and walked by us. Ben thankfully didn't say anything directly to them, because I would have had to wreck his ass...but once they got in their car, he goes  "Well I hope they don't come back. That guy was a prick. He was a fucking asshole. What the fuck, man...I paid $12 to see this band, and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy because I wanna dance...fuckin' asshole...".   And at that particular point, Ben and I were done. Any chance of him and I getting along was washed down the drain. I took a deep breath. He looked right at me, almost daring me to say something. I looked at him and shrugged as I spoke. "Maybe you're the asshole, Ben. He paid $12 to get in, too...and he obviously enjoys music in a different way than you do. You're ruining it for him, and he's ruining it for you...so I'd call that even."  He opened his mouth to say something, and I just stuck my hands in my pockets and walked away. I could hear Becky yelling after me "Where are you going?" and I just said over my shoulder "Need a beer..." and away I went. Things were decidedly chilly when they came back in, but only on his end. Both the older couples came back. He and Jamie danced a few more times. Jamie came and sat down next to me and said she hoped I wasn't mad at her. I said no, it had nothing to do with her, I just didn't like her friend, and that we were good. He and I stayed away from each other the rest of the night, and everyone pretty much had a good time after that.  I ended up getting home about 1am, and stayed up to watch Conan Obrien because I couldn't sleep. Live music tends to do that to me...even when I don't dance.

      I got so excited about being like all the cool kids and changing (and subsequently going in and customizing) my template that I didn't even notice that my links were gone. How rude!! And do you think I had any of them written down? Fuck no. So now I have to try to remember the actual addresses for all my daily reads. If you read this and you know that I had a link to your blog on here, or you read this and I didn't have a link to you but you think I should put one up, can you email me and let me know what your site address is?

      This is a copy of an email that I just sent to my best friend, Maggie, who currently resides in Seward, Alaska. You might remember my mentioning that she and her boyfriend quit their jobs, packed everything up in his Jeep, and drove out there this spring with no jobs, no where to live, and about $1000 between the two of them. Anyway...she's doing really well out there...they both found good jobs and a little apartment, and she seems quite happy. I miss her terribly, though. The purpose of my showing you this email is to reaffirm the fact to any of you who do not know me that well that I am, in fact, truly as weird in real life as I am on this blog (which actually IS 99% real life anyway. Ok, 98%....95% at LEAST).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Enjoy.  &nbsp;   There's something fundamentally wrong with the fact that one&nbsp;(meaning myself)&nbsp;can ingest veritable POUNDS of raw carrots and yet still remain ravenously hungry not 5 minutes afterward.  &nbsp;  I just thought you should be aware of that fact.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The sky is very bright blue and there are lovely big puffy white marshmallow clouds outside my window. However, I know better than to venture outside, as I can see the paint bubbling on the vehicles out in the parking lot, it's so hot out. I knew that if I complained about it being unseasonably cool enough times, someone upstairs would eventually turn the oven on and blast me, just out of spite.  &nbsp;  My stomach is making strange, gurgling, "feed me something besides carrots you retard, I'm empty" sounds. I'm hoping that my co-workers don't notice. How embarassing.  &nbsp;  I need to write you another letter, because I need to tell you about my log-house-building adventure from this weekend. Plus, I miss you. And I have something to send you that I hope you will like.  &nbsp;  I think that's it for now. It's almost lunch time. If I can just...hold...out...another...10....minutes...*quivers at the thought of&nbsp;the turkey and cheese sandwich beckoning her from the fridge*  &nbsp;  love  your nut-job best friend who's stuck in new england where it's hotter than Hades and not half as amusing.  &nbsp;  ps: Did you read my letter? Did you laugh at the mouse story? Be honest. ;)  &nbsp;  pps: the moral of this email, if you had not picked up on it, is to stay away from carrots if you are truly hungry, because they will do nothing except make your stomach have loud, scringy-sounding bouts of empty growling and leave a funny taste in your mouth.  &nbsp;  ppps: I hear that if you eat enough carrots over an extended period of time, they will actually start to turn your skin slightly yellowish-orangey. I would count this as another "con" against carrots, personally.  &nbsp;  pppps: But then again, you may have noticed that my personal opinion of carrots is not especially high to begin with.  &nbsp;  ppppps: Ok, I'm really going now. ;) If you made it this far, I'm proud of you! ;)

      Ok, first things first - he picked me. Well...there's a lot more to it than that, but the very abridged version of the story is that he picked me. He also got run through the ringer by that woman...but I won't air any more dirty laundry than is needed at the moment.  &nbsp;  Weekend stuff: Spent quite a lot of it worrying about the end result of last week's drama. Decided to be proactive and get out and do something so I wouldn't think of it so much...so I did the early-morning grocery run with my mom (and dad went this time, too) and then when we got back, my dad and I went down to my aunt and uncle's house to help work on the addition that they're putting up. It's a log house, so the addition is...umm...logs. Lots of logs. Long, heavy logs. It's all good though, because being the brute that I am, I can pick up things like logs. Big manly logs. Very heavy wooden logs. So I spent a good portion of the afternoon sweating like a pig in the mid-july mid-day holy-fucking-hotness-Batman sun and humidity, schlepping logs. Just a side note, quickly - where as I can grunt my way through picking up one end of a log and hefting it up into the back of a truck so long as someone else has the other end (they were long...8-10 footers), my uncle Craig really IS buff, and he was picking the shit up BY HIMSELF. A whole log. Just picked it up and away he went. I was like "Dude...you're a mutant!!"&nbsp; He just laughed at me....but he didn't deny it.  &nbsp;  Anyway...so I lugged logs, I measured logs, I prepared logs for setting, I helped set logs...I wanted to cut logs, but they wouldn't let me. I drank lots of water and put sunscreen on because my dad kept harping about skin cancer. I wore gloves and had boots on. I sweat a LOT. I was the picture of Vermont health and hard working-ness. Then, around 3pm,&nbsp;my stomach turned a little. I continued to work through the queasiness, thinking it was just the result of chugging too much cold water too fast. About 5 minutes later, I&nbsp;decided to go over and sit in the shade for a minute. I sat down, I sipped&nbsp;my water...and I got very, VERY dizzy. I stood&nbsp;up, and sat right back down again immediately when the earth tilted and my vision blurred. My dad looked over at&nbsp;me and I&nbsp;could see his mouth move but&nbsp;I couldn't really hear him. I&nbsp;stood up again and took a few deep breaths, and made my way toward the house.&nbsp;I sat down in the shade on the&nbsp;porch and my aunt Cheryl intercepted me. "Are you ok?" she asked. I nodded, but I felt like I was going to hurl. She looked at me, concerned. I took another sip of water and said "My stomach doesn't feel quite right...I just got really queasy. I'm ok now."&nbsp; She crossed her arms. "When was the last time you&nbsp;ate something?" I blinked.&nbsp;"Uhh..ate?"&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah...like, food? In&nbsp;your mouth? You chew and swallow? When was the last time&nbsp;you did that?"&nbsp; I had to think about it.&nbsp;"Hmmm...I had a muffin this morning."&nbsp;She raised her eyebrows a little.&nbsp;"What time this morning?"&nbsp; I rubbed my eyes.&nbsp;The dizziness was subsiding but I felt overwhelmingly tired. "I dunno...7.30 or 8 I&nbsp;guess...why?"&nbsp;&nbsp;She just shook her head. "Come inside where it's cool."&nbsp; I trudged into the house behind her and plunked down in a stool at the counter.&nbsp;She pulled out some englush muffins and some tuna salad from the fridge and started making me a sandwhich. "You can't go&nbsp;6 or 7 hours doing work like what you were doing and as hot as it is and not have anything in your stomach.&nbsp;You're lucky you didn't pass out."&nbsp; I smiled sheepishly as she handed me the&nbsp;toasted muffin with&nbsp;tuna on it, and thought to myself&nbsp; "you don't know just how close I&nbsp;came..." but I just said "bah...I was alright..."&nbsp; &nbsp;After the sandwhich and some time inside where it was cool, I was back to my former bad-ass buffness...except I didn't go back out and work after that...I stayed in the shade near the pool and let the real men do the work. I mean...that IS what they're there for...right?  &nbsp;  It's a good thing I gave up when I did...I woke up the next morning feeling about 90 years old, and only a slightly younger and more healthy 85 this morning. I'm glad my stomach took me out of commission in time to save my back...;)

      It's funny how, when you're trying your hardest to NOT think about something, the universe has an uncanny ability to put something around every corner that will remind you of what you're trying so hard to forget. Everything&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;from&nbsp;the place he grew up&nbsp;today...everyone has his name. Every song I hear is one I would sing to him or he to me, or simply one that speaks of a certain and unwavering love...paints a portrait of a simple life shared together...an uncomplicated understanding.  &nbsp;  I long for that quiet, uncomplicated understanding. Perhaps I'm simply being idealistic. Perhaps this is the remainder of the naiveté of 24 years of fairly sheltered life that I need to shed. Am I truly that green? I have seen hardship, financial and emotional.&nbsp;I have been lifted to the heights of joy, and I have sunk so low as to feel I'd never dig my way out. I've made mistakes, sometimes several times over, and eventually learned from them. Is this another lesson I've been chosen to learn? That no matter how badly you want or need something and no matter how much it means to you, it can always be taken away? I've lost before. I know that the one who offers can always rescind, always withdraw...I know that nothing is carved in stone so long as this great rock of ours spins in space. Why do I need to have this taught to me again? Did I not appreciate what I had, when I had it? I know I certainly didn't take it for granted...I made damn sure of that. Maybe the lesson is less one of not taking things for granted, and more one of not putting all one's eggs in a single basket? But then...if I'm not to invest all my faith, my trust and love, my whole heart&nbsp;in one person and they the same in me, then what's the point of love at all? What's the point of building up a relationship, a little at a time... bricks&nbsp;made up&nbsp;of trust, affection, friendship, passion...only to have the ground yanked right out from underneath said structure and watching it crumble to the ground?&nbsp;When does the universe finally tire of kicking over my dreams and watching them spill out into the mud?  &nbsp;  Possibly this sounds like I'm having a "poor me" moment, and feeling quite sorry for myself, but that's not necessarily the case.&nbsp;I am legitimately asking these things, because I have come to the realization that I don't know the answers. The situation is infinitely more complicated than I could ever hope to detail here, but it involves a girl and a boy who love each other (present tense mind you...it's not the past yet) very much, and a past love of the boy's that resurfaced with neither warning nor reason, other than to tell him "I want you back". She is someone he loved very deeply many years ago, and circumstances at the time became such that she needed to move away and he would not, or could not, follow her. There were no goodbyes...there was no closure...and he was left burying her in his mind, considering her dead. He never figured he would see or hear from her again. He didn't...for 7 long years...and then suddenly, on Monday, for reasons only the universe is yet privy to, she dialed his phone number. She said the words. "I miss you...I think about you...I want to make something work...I want you back". The girl that this boy loves is now left with an ache in her chest and cried-dry tear ducts, because he's doing what he has to do. He's going back to see her...to see if she's at all the same person. He isn't the same person he was 7 years ago...he admits that. He feels like he needs closure. The girl he loves understands that. She can't necessarily admit that she would react the same way to such a situation were the tables turned, but she does understand. He has dropped everything and taken the weekend to go back home and see the past love. He left in a hurry not so much because he is anxious to see this woman, but more out of respect for the girl he loves. He wants to get it over with. He doesn't want to string it out and hurt her any more than he has to. She appreciates this, and it is a reaffirmation of how deeply he really does feel for her. However...she is now left for a whole weekend with nothing to do but sit and think. How is she to compete with a love that, by all accounts, was so complete and deep? How is she supposed to just sit on her hands all weekend and wait to see if she's the big winner, or the big, heartbroken loser? She isn't that type of girl. She is fiercely independent, self-reliant, and hates to ask for help. She feels backed into a corner. Helplessness is not her idea of a good time. So what does she do? Does she start to grieve now, in hopes that he will come back and the grief will have been silly and melodramatic and unnecessary? Does she take a deep breath, suck it all up, and give herself a pep talk, telling herself that he couldn't possibly want to rekindle something so far gone when he has something so special at home? She could do that...but then wouldn't the disappointment be twice as deep when she finds herself knocked off that pedestal? She can't decide whether to cry for love lost, for frustration and anger, or simply to take her mind off of the 80 million thoughts bombarding her little brain at every single waking moment lately. She's tired as all hell, but she would choose to&nbsp;work 14 hours a day and then go home and pass out immediately, rather than have any sort of time alone with herself and her thoughts right now.

      I know, I know...my absence has been unacceptable. I'm sure you're all just weeping your eyes out about it. Well dry up...I'm back...;)  Quick overview of my 4th of July long-ass weekend: Took Friday off, hung out with Beck who I hadn't seen in frickin' ages, went grocery shopping with Beck and Mom at evil Walmart, spent all day saturday trying to get a tan but the sun wouldn't stay out for long enough to do me much damage, was prepared to go to the parade with Beck and Shan on Sunday, but bailed at the last minute because it was too hot to put jeans on, and I wouldn't be caught dead in shorts and I didn't have a summery skirt on hand, grabbed my shades and bathing suit and crashed beside the pool with Mumsies all day - SPF 4 in tow mind you - and improved upon my already ludicrously Native American looking tan, swam in the pool a bit even though the water was only 72 - doesn't sound cold but IT IS, had scads of barbecue all weekend long...I think it's my dad's personal goal of the summer to try to grill every available cut of every type of meat offered in every grocery store within a 30-mile radius, dragged my dad to the fireworks which were actually REALLY good this year, had to drive dad's truck home from the fireworks when he had a fire call (he's a volunteer fire fighter for our town) half-way home and had to turn around...and I think that's about it. There was random boozing and schmoozing interspersed with all of that, but you knew that...  And now, the news. I cut my hair! Cut it! All off! It's GONE!! Well, not totally...that would suck...but it is WAY shorter than I bargained for. S'what I get for handing the scissors over to my mom, I guess...especially when she's trying to quit smoking...hah! Lucky I have any left!! But seriously...I had hair down to my waist, no joke....and now it's just about 3 inches below my chin. SHORT. I haven't had it this short since junior year of high school. It looks a lot better, but it will still take some getting used to.   Also - valueable lesson learned this weekend - leave the shaping of your eyebrows either to nature, or to a professional. Do not try to shape your own eyebrows, no matter how easy you think it might be and no matter how good of an eye you have for things like that. If you have not been to beautician school, just say no. And for the love of fuck, if you've had a glass or three of Gil's Rocket Fuel over the course of an afternoon, please know enough to just WALK AWAY from the microwaveable wax kit. It will not only burn you, but it will leave you with a left eyebrow that tapers all too quickly to a needle-fine point and a right eyebrow that has a 1/4 chunk missing out of the bottom of it. I quit while I was ahead...god only knows what I'd have been stuck with if I tried to "even them out"....!!!

      re: yesterday's post and that whole situation - resolved. Well, mostly anyway. There are still some hurt feelings and ruffled feathers, and his trust in me is (rightly) a bit bruised...but there ended up being no "I don't want to see you anymore..." or  any "I don't love you anymore...", so I feel pretty good now. I was, quite honestly, scared fairly shitless all day yesterday and last night, but this morning I sort of woke up feeling like everything was going to be ok...and it ended up being so. Two bonus points for women's intuition, I guess.   So there's that...very relieved!!  I make my big trek to the airport to pick up Maggie tomorrow night. Flight comes in at 1am. That's not so bad. Her mom is going with me...two hours each way in the car with her isn't so bad either. What might not be so hot is the like 6 hours before that in which I will come home from work and try to clean house and possibly take a nap, while said mom is at my house, because maggie told her to meet me there at 5.30, when we're not even leaving until like 11. Errrerererererrrrrr! And then to compound that, Maggs calls me this afternoon to confirm that her mom is going, and she tacks on this little gem - "Just a heads-up...she's been doing therapy again, which is good...but because of the whole overdose thing back last winter, they don't have her on any meds. She's trying to learn to channel her feelings, rather than just do drugs. So...you know...if it gets a little weird, just tell her...she'll understand."  Riiiiiiiiiiight...I'm going to just mention offhand to the Benadryl Queen that she's getting just a leeeeetle too freaky for me, and I'm sure she'll just knock it right down a couple notches. Mmmkay.  Actually, she's a very sweet, nice woman, and I love her to death. She can just be a little...intense...sometimes. But oh well...anything for Maggs!   Interesting development: my boss has one of those Sprint PCS picture phone thingies...and his new habit is to take pictures with the phone while on the road and email them to me. Like...on his way into work, or on his way home. Mm hmm.   Also...hopped on the scale today, just for shits and giggles, because I've been very VERY good this week aside from the alcohol consumption (which I am reminded DAILY by my good friends at caloriescount.com DO count against your daily calorie intake, no matter HOW stressed and needy you're feeling when you down that bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon. Calories don't CARE about your personal life!!)...and voila!! Lost 10 lbs since...erm...last time I hopped on the scales which was...ermmmmm...*thinks hard* about 2 weeks ago? w00t!! Too bad I can't run home and have beer, pizza and ice cream to celebrate...bastards...

      I did a bad, bad thing. I told a lie...and not a little white lie...to someone that I care more about than anyone else in the world. It didn't seem like a big deal at the time...and in complete honesty (no, really...I'm not trying to be funny) that one lie was the only one I've ever told him. Just that one. It wasn't even about anything terribly important. It was a stupid-ass lie for a stupid-ass reason, and now I'm sitting here looking like...well...a stupid ass...because I had to eventually tell the truth. When it originated, I didn't even think...I just opened my mouth and it came out. I didn't think about the fact that I'd eventually have to fess up to the fact that I didn't tell the truth. I didn't think about how it would eventually make HIM feel to know that I'd done that. I didn't think about how it would have made me feel if he'd done the same thing to me. I was only concerned with the situation being easy for me at the time. I exhibited the epitome of selfishness, and I wholeheartedly regret that. It was an extremely poor choice, and I couldn't possibly be more sorry or feel worse about any other poor choice I've ever made...and believe you me, there's been a few.   I am scared shitless, and I'll tell you why. He has two cardinal rules...two no-tolerance, set in stone, die-before-breaking principles. One is that you don't cheat. The other is that you don't lie to the people you love. You just. Plain. Don't. And I truly and honestly believe in and try to live those rules, too. However, I am only human. And I made a very human mistake. I misled him on one stupid, insignificant little thing that would have made me uncomfortable to tell the truth about in the beginning, so I didn't do it. Selfish. Stupid. So now I'm sitting here waiting. I'm holding my breath for all I'm worth. He and I have talked it to death. We've both been brought to tears over it. There is nothing I can do now except wait for him to decide if what I did is unacceptable. It's already been forgiven - I knew that before he even told me that, because that's the way he is...that's part of the reason I love him so much. But I also understand where he's coming from...how hurt he is, how shocked he is, and how it is now making him question everything that he and I have built upon and taken as given for so long. He's not shocked and hurt by what I actually lied about...but simply that I lied. He thought he knew me better than that. I guess I thought I knew me better, too.   I feel very empty, very cold, and extremely ashamed of myself, and I would give absolutely anything in the world to be able to go back and tell the truth from the beginning.   I'm so sorry, baby...I don't know what else to say.

      "From Blossoms"  From blossoms comes this brown paper bag of peaches we bought from the boy at the bend in the road where we turned toward signs painted Peaches.  From laden boughs, from hands, from sweet fellowship in the bins, comes nectar at the roadside, succulent peaches we devour, dusty skin and all, comes the familiar dust of summer, dust we eat.   O, to take what we love inside, to carry within us an orchard, to eat not only the skin, but the shade, not only the sugar, but the days, to hold the fruit in our hands, adore it, then bite into the round jubilance of peach.  There are days we live as if death were nowhere in the backgroundl from joy to joy to joy, from wing to wing, from blossom to blossom to impossible blossom, to sweet impossible blossom.   -Li-Young Lee (1957-     )
