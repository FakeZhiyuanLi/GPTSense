      Not much to say today, just making sure I have this thing up and running.  I just finished an essay for one of my classes discussing the causes of burnout in the office.  If I can figure out how to do it, I'll post a story I wrote about the same problem.  If I can't figure out how to attach it, I'll post it later tonight or tomorrow as a post.    As far as the ideas for my stories - I come about story ideas in what I think is a very different way.  Sometimes, just starting at the ceiling in the middle of the night, a story will pop into my head.  I never write these ideas down - if it's a decent story idea, it sits in my mind and seems to almost grow - to gain substance.  I write the story in my mind, and then - when it's fully developed - I type it out.  Except for this last story I started...

      Ka.  Ka like a wind, as one of my favorite literary heroes says quite often.  I plan on becoming a published writer someday, and there's no time like the present.  I was never the type to talk about myself - and nothing's changed because I posted this blog - but I would like a forum to share some of my writings with people all over the world.  Any suggestions or tips to improve my writing would be great; any negative comments would be depressing but considered.  As for story ideas...I have plenty of those.  Maybe someday I'll explain how I come up with ideas for my stories.  However, I've spent most of the day just setting up this blog, so this first post is all I can manage for now.  I have no idea how this will work, or what it will help, or even if I'll continue it very long.  I guess it all depends on one thing, as my hero says.  Ka.

      Well, my monitor has been on the fritz for the last couple of weeks, making typing stories nearly impossible.  However, a new screen is on the way, and I have a couple stories that I'll post when I can transfer them from the paper to the typed word.

      I just started reading the book  On Writing  by Stephen King, and it made me think for a while...why do I write?  Of course, I was pondering this question while I was supposed to be finishing the story I promised in my last post, but that's not important...  I write because I can - I've met many people who just can't seem to find the words to express themselves.  It has to be frustrating to have a story trapped inside your head, and finding yourself unable to translate it to words.    I write because I enjoy writing - I find it relaxing, almost hypnotic.  At least, I feel this way when it's going right.  When I find myself struggling to find the words to describe something, I stop writing and start reading something again.  I write because I want to be a writer.  Everything else seems unfufulling, almost boring in comparison.  When I write - it's a powerful feeling.  The feeling of creation.  That's why I write.  I'll try to post a story soon - the one I promised last post is close to completion.  If anyone reading this would like to share why they write (or why they don't), I'll be happy to read.

      I know in my previous post I had stated that I would be posting a different story, but another story has clawed its way into the forefront of my consciousness.  I'll try to get it onto paper tonight, but no guarantees.    Someone finally placed a comment on my page today (thanks Maranie!) and then I go and delete it while fiddling with my options.  Proof once again that the most likely thing to destroy my blog is my own carelessness.  Ah, well.  As for the mail machine reference - that's what the new story is regarding.  Ever have a bad experience with a salesman that just wouldn't take no for an answer?  Me too...my company was looking to purchase a new mail machine, and when I awarded the business to one of the competing companies, this salesman at another company started calling me constantly.  A joke by one of my coworkers led to the story that I'll post later...

      I actually found time to type one of the stories I had written longhand, and it's below for your reading pleasure.&nbsp; I have a long novel I'm working on that won't be ready for quite a while, and a few other short story ideas floating around.&nbsp; One that I'm working on just came to me the other day, and it's an interesting topic (at least to me, it is).   What would a person do if they woke up and knew it was their last day on Earth?   That's it.&nbsp; If anyone wants to try their hand at that one before I do, feel free, and drop me a line. I'd love to read it!

      First Touch  Brandon C. Kerlee&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young boys who think they are men will do strange, sometimes desperate things in order to learn more about the mysterious female form.&nbsp; Once, many years ago, I embarked upon one such exciting, strange, and wonderful adventure.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a Tuesday, and I had just stepped off the school bus and headed into my house.&nbsp; Nobody was home – there was a note from my mother saying that she was out and would be back by 6:00, and my dad did not usually arrive home until about 6 or 6:30.&nbsp; I dropped my bookbag in its usual spot by the door (instead of hanging it up on the hooks located just above its resting place) and ran to the phone to call my girlfriend, as was our daily ritual at the time.&nbsp; Never mind that we talked and passed notes every chance we had during school, and we saw each other every weekend; we still had to talk on the phone for at least a couple of hours every night as well.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As was the custom, I plopped down on the couch and lifted the phone.&nbsp; I dialed her number and listened to the ringing, anticipating her voice and wondering what it was we were going to talk about.&nbsp; We never seemed to run out of topics; it didn’t matter how long or how often we talked, there was always something to say.&nbsp; Finally, after about three-and-a-half long rings, she answered.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talked for a few minutes about our respective days at school – I had taken a Spanish test (and done rather poorly, concerned more about the latest note from my girlfriend than the test I was taking) and she had given a presentation in her English class.&nbsp; Then she asked me a very unexpected question; could I come over to see her at her apartment?&nbsp; I really wanted to see her, but I had no way to get there, as neither my mom nor my dad was due to arrive home anytime soon.&nbsp; I asked if her dad could zip over and pick me up, as we only lived a couple of miles away from each other.&nbsp; At this point, she gave me the bad news – she told me that her dad was not home, and was not due back until 8:00.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn’t believe my terrible luck – there she was, home alone, and I had no way to reach her!&nbsp; I sadly explained again that neither of my parents was there, and I had nobody who could drive me over to her apartment.&nbsp; As I was about to give up and return to the educational slant that our conversation started with, she blasted my young morals to a million tiny, jagged pieces with the most dangerous weapon of all – herself.&nbsp; She told me that if I could somehow make it to her apartment, she would let me feel her chest.&nbsp; I started to protest; we did that every time we made out – the curve and softness of her breast was embedded in my fingertips’ memories forever – I knew every bump and lace pattern on every bra she owned (we had never removed any clothes when groping each other – that would just be inappropriate) and just how far I could tug on her bra before she would stop me (not very far at all, truth be told).&nbsp; It was now that she launched her final attack on my restraint.&nbsp; If I somehow made it to her apartment, I would get to feel her chest – under her bra!&nbsp; If before there had been any question of where I would be that afternoon, there was no longer even a shred of doubt.&nbsp; I had to get to her.&nbsp; I said goodbye and hung up the phone to formulate my plan.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a couple seconds of thought, I dashed into the garage and ran to my bike.&nbsp; What I saw just made me stop and stare; both tires had settled to the ground, there was a long rip in one where the tire had actually rotted away, the seat was stuck in the lowest position and the chain sagged like a dead snake from the rusted gears.&nbsp; It was then that I remembered I had not even moved my bike for quite a while, let alone actually ridden the thing; there was no way it could survive the two-mile trip to my girlfriend’s apartment.&nbsp; I stood there for a minute, cursing my bad luck under my breath when another idea struck.&nbsp; I could take my sister’s bike!&nbsp; I walked over to the other side of the garage where it rested against the wall.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pink, with white handlebars and glistening silver wheels with perfect tires (and inflated, no less!), the bike was my salvation on two wheels.&nbsp; Of course, I couldn’t ride a girl’s bike…could I?&nbsp; I thought for what seemed like hours (it was really about ten seconds – I mean, look at the reward!&nbsp; How could I miss out on something like that?) about whether or not it was a good idea. All debate ended and I hopped on the bike and rolled it out of the garage.&nbsp; Taking a final furtive glance around to make sure nobody was watching me, I closed the garage door with a slam and hopped on the bike to head for my destiny.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started out making great time – the first part of the journey was along a small side road that led through a park, so there was no danger from cars or trucks, and little danger of the humiliation of discovery.&nbsp; About halfway to her apartment, however, I was forced to ride alongside a fairly major roadway.&nbsp; I feared the worst; what male wants to be caught riding his sister’s bike?&nbsp; There was very little traffic, however, as it was 3:30 in the afternoon.&nbsp; As I raced towards my girlfriend’s apartment, I began to let my mind wander to thoughts of what I was about to encounter.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been dating her for about four months, and up until a couple of weeks ago we had not gone any farther than kissing and cuddling.&nbsp; We would sit in my room for hours – watching movies or listening to the radio, kissing and groping outside of each other’s clothes the whole while.&nbsp; Just recently, during one of the aforementioned sessions, she un-tucked her shirt and gently placed my hand on her bare stomach.&nbsp; Petrified, I left my hand there for the next half hour while we kissed, until I finally mustered the courage to slide my hand north to her chest.&nbsp; When I touched her bra, I was sure she would turn and smack me across the face; instead she turned her back to me and arched her neck and back so that she was resting in my lap.&nbsp; She put her hand over mine on the outside of her shirt and helped me massage her chest through her bra!&nbsp; It only lasted a couple of minutes, but to my young, impressionable, immature mind it felt like hours.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drifting deep within my thoughts, I was suddenly stunned to find that I had arrived at my Shangri-La, and her dad’s car was nowhere in sight!&nbsp; I stashed the embarrassingly pink bike behind her apartment and rang the doorbell.&nbsp; She answered and without a single word (just a sinister little smirk) let me in and gently shut the door.&nbsp; I heard the lock snap shut, and I turned to look at my girlfriend.&nbsp; She had on a very loose-fitting blouse that showed the straps of her white lace bra, and a wonderfully short pair of shorts.&nbsp; She suggested we watch some television first to relax.&nbsp; I needed to catch my breath anyway; biking two miles is no easy task when you haven’t been biking in a long time.&nbsp; We walked into the family room and sat down to watch television – I sat on the couch and she sat on the floor in front of me, just like always.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started to rub her shoulders, and I noticed she was more into the attention I was giving her than what was on the screen in front of her.&nbsp; She sighed softly and leaned back against the couch.&nbsp; When I glanced down from the screen, I realized I could see down her shirt, and if she leaned forward just a little bit, I would be able to see under her bra!&nbsp; As she sat now, however, her bra was firmly covering her breasts; I couldn’t see anything other than the lacy pattern and the straps.&nbsp; I slyly tried to nudge her forward so that her bra would not fit nearly so tightly, and I might get a better view of the topography, so to speak.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She realized immediately what I was trying to do, and chided me at once.&nbsp; She jokingly called me a pig and then jumped up saying she had to go fix her top if she was going to keep sitting below me like this.&nbsp; As she walked away, I knew that I had blown my chance – there was no way she was going to let me feel under her bra now – she though I was a pig!&nbsp; When she returned, she had a different blouse on, one that was much tighter around her neck so that I could no longer see down her shirt.&nbsp; I sighed and returned to watching television and absentmindedly rubbing her shoulders.&nbsp; She sighed again and leaned into my soft caresses, but I didn’t really notice; I was still stinging from my earlier (assumed) rejection.&nbsp; It was then that I noticed a wonderful development – there were no bra-straps on the shoulders I was rubbing!&nbsp; She looked up at me, and I looked down into her eyes, and without a word she stood up and led me into her bedroom.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once there, she lay down on the twin bed and stared up at me.&nbsp; I knelt beside her and began to kiss her, rubbing her stomach with my right hand and softly stroking her long, curly black mane of hair with my left.&nbsp; At least, that’s how I prefer to remember it; I was likely shaking with fear and anticipation and trying to yank every hair from her head, but I prefer my version of the memory.&nbsp; We kissed for at least a half hour like this, until I slowly slid my hand towards the climax of the whole adventure.&nbsp; Closer and closer I drew – reveling in the softness and smoothness of her skin and slowly burrowing my hand closer and closer to its desired destination.&nbsp; Finally, when I though I could stand the suspense no longer, I reached up and gently cupped her breast.&nbsp; She drew in a sharp breath and placed her hand on mine, and we just stayed like that for what seemed like an eternity (again, probably less than ten seconds).&nbsp; Suddenly, and without any warning at all, she abruptly sat up and told me I had to leave.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the door slammed behind me, I wondered what I had done wrong.&nbsp; Wonder and confusion soon gave way to elation, however – I had done the unthinkable.&nbsp; I had touched my girlfriend’s chest – her chest without a bra!&nbsp; The thought had a mystical, almost musical quality about it, and I grinned as I realized that I had passed one of the many mile markers on the highway to becoming a man.&nbsp; I walked over, hopped on my sister’s bike and began the long ride home.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost in thought, I never heard the car pulling to a stop next to me as I was riding home along the road.&nbsp; In fact, I would never have noticed if my mom had not suddenly asked what I was doing, riding my sister’s bike along a public road.&nbsp; I turned with a start and saw my mom, sitting behind the wheel of her car, staring at me quizzically.&nbsp; I attempted to stutter out a reply, but she ignored my ramblings and just shook her head as she drove away in the direction of our home.&nbsp; When I arrived home that night, no mention of my adventure was made.&nbsp; In fact, it was not until years later – at our wedding reception, no less, &nbsp;that my dad recounted the event in front of both my grandmothers, her whole family and last but not least, my younger sister and the owner of the bike.&nbsp; My wife and I still chuckle about the event from time to time, and maybe someday, she’ll even tell me why she threw me out of her apartment on that lazy yet educational afternoon.

      Life Begins at 120  Brandon C.Kerlee  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The wind whipped through her red-blonde hair, tossing it around her face.&nbsp; She glanced down at the dash and saw she was going just under eighty, so she stepped harder on the gas and watched the tach needle spike towards the red before she dropped the clutch and slammed the car into fourth gear.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a 1969 Corvette, and a real monster of a car.&nbsp; Three hundred and fifty-plus horsepower propelling a fiberglass body that was the deepest red she had ever seen.&nbsp; The sunlight twinkled off the chrome bumpers and reflected into the heavily sloped windshield every few seconds, but not enough to blind her.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she stood harder on the gas and watched the speedometer needle edge towards one hundred and fifteen miles per hour, she grinned and whipped the steering wheel to the left, dashing into the adjacent lane and nearly sideswiping a car that had been in her lane.&nbsp; The car had just appeared in front of her – she could have been killed!&nbsp; The thought made her laugh out loud; after all, if her boyfriend caught her with his car, he’d kill her anyway.&nbsp; Not that he would catch her, at least – at least, not while she had his only car.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three hours ago, she had driven over to his apartment to surprise him.&nbsp; She was supposed to be spending her spring break (only five more quarters at Ohio University to go) with her parents in Nevada, but she had blown them off with a weak lie; something about a project due in one of her classes.&nbsp; She intended to spend the week with him, just hanging out (and doing all kinds of incredibly naughty, scandalous things, too) and taking a well-deserved break from classes and responsibilities.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She headed to his apartment, looking at the sky and noticing a tiny bit of sun peeking from between a couple of puffy white clouds.&nbsp; They looked like cottonballs, she thought to herself.&nbsp; She smiled – maybe they could go on a picnic!&nbsp; Even though it wasn’t very sunny, it was a nice, cool, dry afternoon, and she loved to ride in his car with the top down on days like that.&nbsp; Lost in her daydream, she nearly missed the entrance to his apartment complex.&nbsp; She laughed at herself under her breath and drove towards his part of the complex.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she parked her old Ford next to his Corvette, she noticed something odd.&nbsp; There was a strange car parked in his other parking spot.&nbsp; He hadn’t said anything about a new car; in fact, he had been complaining about having the Corvette in the shop all of last week for a tune-up and how he had to walk to the store for everything.&nbsp; Dismissing the momentary strangeness, she hopped out of her car, walked to his door and rang the bell.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the door opened, she was shocked to see a woman answer, wearing nothing but an oversized T-shirt and bikini briefs.&nbsp; The woman started to ask what she needed, who was she, what was she doing here, but she just brushed by the strange woman and began yelling for her boyfriend.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked down the stairs to meet her, ignoring the rising protests of the T-shirted woman and just stared at his girlfriend.&nbsp; He said that he was sorry, that he should have told her that he was seeing someone else and was in love with her.&nbsp; He just didn’t know how to end things.&nbsp; He said that she shouldn’t have found out this way.&nbsp; Then, in a final heartless gesture, he told her that she needed to leave.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was when she noticed the keys to the Corvette on the table by the door.&nbsp; She sprinted to the table and snatched them off, knocking a vase with a few wilted, sickly roses to the floor.&nbsp; The vase shattered as it hit the floor, spraying shards of glass and blackening petals across the entrance.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman in the T-shirt grabbed for her as she dashed toward the door, but only received a hard shove to the chest and a large slash across her cheek, courtesy of the ignition key to a 1969 Chevrolet Corvette.&nbsp; The woman howled and clapped her hand to her torn face, and stumbled towards the bathroom.&nbsp; Glancing up the stairs at her shocked boyfriend (with his mouth hanging open that far, you could probably fit a softball in there, she thought) she glared at him and then turned and walked out of the apartment.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was shaking as she walked out of the apartment – she really didn’t mean to hurt the woman, she had just lashed out in a furious rage.&nbsp; She looked at the key held tightly in her hand and noticed a small smear of bright red blood on the tip.&nbsp; She wiped it off on her blouse and began to walk towards the Corvette.&nbsp; A coldness descended upon her – she was going to destroy the thing he loved most to hurt him, the same way he had hurt her.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she realized she could never damage such a fine car – the sloping fenders and the polished wheels with their huge white-lettered tires.&nbsp; The steel sidepipes, raw and angry.&nbsp; The convertible top, hidden under the red fiberglass cover.&nbsp; The chrome bumpers sparkling in the sunlight, and the bulging, sloping hood that thinly disguised the power beneath.&nbsp; He didn’t deserve to have a car this nice, she thought; but she couldn’t bring herself to destroy it.&nbsp; Just then she realized something.&nbsp; He didn’t deserve to have this car.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She did.  Jumping into the car, she floored the clutch and slipped the key into the ignition.&nbsp; The car started right up – the rumble of the exhaust was low and ominous – the sound of raw power and anger.&nbsp; She slipped the shifter into reverse and backed out.&nbsp; Stomping on the gas, she dropped the clutch and left two fat burn marks on the asphalt parking lot as she sped away.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here she was, cruising the interstate at one hundred and fifteen miles an hour with the wind in her hair (that feeling was the best reason to own a convertible, she thought) and nothing on her mind anymore but speed.&nbsp; She was sure he had called the cops by now, but they’d have to catch her first.&nbsp; She didn’t know where she was headed, but as long as she got as far away from him as she could, everything would be alright eventually.&nbsp; After all, there were a few clouds in the sky, but she could see the sun hiding, waiting for its chance to reveal itself.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was when she finally noticed the flashing red and blue lights in the rearview mirror.&nbsp; Stealing a glance into the side mirrors, she saw one – no, two more cops coming up fast on either side of her.&nbsp; She returned her gaze forward to the road, and just in time as she barely missed hitting a slow-moving truck in her lane (and when you’re going this fast, she thought, they’re all slow-moving) and had to wrench the wheel to the left to avoid a crash.&nbsp; The car wavered for a second, seemed to contemplate spinning out, and then steadied itself and resumed its former straight course.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She realized then how close she had come to losing control – both over the car and her life.&nbsp; And all over a jerk of a boyfriend who wasn’t even worth it?&nbsp; That was just a stupid decision, she thought – a “real no-brainer” as her mom would say.&nbsp; She let off the accelerator and listened to the rumble of the sidepipes as the car began to decelerate.&nbsp; The patrolmen pulled up on either side of her and kept pace with her as she continued to slow down.&nbsp; She glanced at her knuckles and saw they had gone a pale grayish-white, and then happened to glance down past her hands to the floor of the car.&nbsp; On the floor, sticking out from under the seats was a bit of fabric.&nbsp; Keeping her eyes on the road, she reached down and pulled out a pair of bikini panties that were not hers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dropped the car back down into third gear and smashed the gas pedal to the floor.&nbsp; The car leaped as if it had been struck by lightning and then fishtailed, nearly sideswiping one of the patrol cars and causing him to dart onto the shoulder.&nbsp; He almost regained control, but the heavy patrol car slid off the road and into a ditch.&nbsp; The other patrolman backed off to help his wrecked comrade, leaving her alone again with the car and nothing but the open road ahead of her.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun was out all the way now, bathing the highway in a brilliant light.&nbsp; The wind whipped across the road, pulling ever so slightly at the wheel of the Corvette, but she hardly even noticed.&nbsp; She thought for a second about where she could go, and then she realized that it didn’t really matter.&nbsp; All that mattered was car, the beautiful day and the road ahead.&nbsp; She glanced down at the speedometer and smiled a little to herself as she saw the needle pointing to one hundred and twenty miles per hour.

      At least for now, everything is working great as far as my computer is concerned.&nbsp; New monitor on my desk, I was able to transcribe one of my stories for everyone here to see.&nbsp; Whenever I post a story, it will be completely separate from all other posts...  &nbsp;  Now, without further ado - the first story on this website.
