      Well, since I haven't yet invited anybody to this forum, I'd like to make peace with technology, the good folks at blogger and world by saying thank you for the opportunity to have this forum. I hope everything goes smoothly and there are only positive, creative and constructive discussions on this forum. I pray that everybody gets more out of this forum than they contribute and that contributing is a fun, effortless and positive experience for all involved. Due to the wonders of electronic media, each person can recieve the full benefit of the thoughts and ideas of his predecessors, pushing this discussion forward in a creative, productive and world-changing direction.  I have big dreams for this thread [THE BIGGEST], as I believe it could unite concerned people everywhere in populist movement to take control of our airwaves and television sets, to think critically about media, to understand that media does not have to be a drug that allows us to tune out and forget our problems, rather a powerful tool to be used to increase happiness, fulfillment and equality. The nature of man is not to be doped and mildly amused, rather to be fulfilled and empowered. Media is a powerful tool and I would love to begin to utilize this tool for the good of man, delivering messages of tolerance, mindful challenge and personal growth. Programming should motivate people to get off their couch, not to buy a more comfortable one, but to take insight, apply it to canvas of their own lives and then action their values upon the world.

      This is a fantastic idea.  It should be a federal educational requirement, along with math, english, science, etc.   ****************************************************** http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/corporate/about_us/index.cfm  MNet’s work is based on the belief that to be functionally literate in the world today – to be able to "read" the messages that inform, entertain and sell to us daily – young people need critical thinking skills.  MNet focuses its efforts on equipping adults with information and tools to help young people to understand how the media work, how the media may affect their lifestyle choices and the extent to which they, as consumers and citizens, are being well informed. MNet also provides reference materials for use by adults and youth alike in examining media issues from a variety of perspectives.

      Now this is a project that is right in my power alley. I cannot wait to see how it evolves! Check it out..... *********************************************** http://www.practicaldreamers.org/index.html http://www.practicaldreamers.org/overview.html  ....We met in June 2002 and realized that we had similar goals and objectives, in using media to help catalyze peace action, social justice, and environmental change. We decided to join forces and projects—The Illuminators. The media inter-connection of today's visionaries and access to the ancient wisdom is critical to offering a chorus of new voices for change. The mass media project fear and no hope 24 hours a day,seven days a week, year in and year out. We need an immediate antidote to support the healing of all humanity and of the Earth are at this critical point in our evolution.   Our first interview was conducted on August 7, 2002, and as of September 1, 2003, we have completed over 200 interviews. We continue to complete new interviews, with the goal of documenting 500 Illuminators by this time next year.   We have recorded interviews with people from many professions, cultures and age groups living in the US and Canada. We have developed highly creative graphic design, interactive television, and courseware frameworks to add and extend the value of this important wisdom. Our mission with this project is to illuminate, amplify, and accelerate the evolutionary field of consciousness, that is compassionate, inclusive and based in systems thinking and which reflects the understanding that we are all interconnected parts of a living whole. Our intent is to pierce the illusion of a separate and divided world of "us against them" generates and drives the fear of the evilother, which is the source of most conflict in the world.   Screenwriter, Eleanor Perry once said that "film is such a miraculous medium, it should be on the side of the angels." Film, video and the media can act as powerful cultural drivers and we feel a deep responsibility to join with other cultural and media trance breakers to help people see that another world is not only possible, but is actually in the process of being born through the lives of many dedicated individuals. At the same time, we seek to transform media based in arrogance, which attempts to use fear, control, and power to make the world conform to their agenda.   We believe what is needed is a cooperative and collaborative model, one promoted and lived by The Illuminators who want nothing more than to leave the world a better place for future generations and to inspire and empower current and future generations to live lives of service. That is what others say they want, however, the means to achieve those ends is what differentiates these two groups.   Each of The Illuminators is a practical, compassionate visionary who has placed their life in the service of people and the planet. Each has a unique heart-based story to tell and each is an inspiration. By offering their stories and visions, we hope The Illuminators will inspire and empower viewers and students to explore their own unique talents and share them with a world that needs all the help it can get—right now. This Website, when completed, will allow viewers to explore in depth each Illuminator’s Website, view clips from their interviews, purchase the DVD and book, and order individual interviews for class or group discussion.   As Einstein said, we cannot solve problems at the level they were created. It is the larger, interconnected viewpoint that this project seeks to explore and by connecting the dots of this extraordinary holographic field of consciousness, viewers may actually experience the energy of inspiration and hope through the stories and actions of The Illuminators.   We have self-funded this project and are in the process of generating additional funding to help accelerate the process forward and contribute to its completion. Next steps include producing the companion books, DVDs, a 13 part series for broadcast and cable radio and television, and complete course library for educators.

      I saw this movie on Saturday night and it blew my freaking mind. Explores quantum physics, molecular biology and neurology in the context of discovering who we are and why we are here. Totally rocked my world - just order two books on quantum theory.  Can't wait to dig into this.  I think this a fantastic example of how film, and media in general, can entertain as well as educate. I was on the edge of my seat, thoroughly engaged and entertained. We need more of these films. Can't wait to get the DVD, which is supposed to have hours and hours of additional interviews.  http://www.whatthebleep.com

      Howdy - I just wanted to further discuss the spirit of this thread by emphasizing the importance of the creative mind, as opposed to the competitive mind. The competitive mind focuses on problems, as in "I don't have enough", "he took that from me", "I hate it when that happens".  The creative mind focuses on growth, opportunity and collaboration - the creative mind develops new ideas such that the cause of the problems is removed due to this new idea, and stop-gap measures are no longer necessary.  For example, in the days of horse and buggy, horse droppings littered the streets. People passed laws about horses without droppings bags, implemented restrictions, etc. and other ways to restrict or "compete". Others however, thought more creatively about what a horse is and what it does. Within a short period of time the Wright Brothers and Henry Ford saw opportunity and creative minds set in motion the automobile and airline industry.  These are examples of The Creative Mind. This is the sort of problem solving and idea generation I would like to see thrown at the current media environment. We could spend all day complaining about how bad it is and how we're been exploited, yadda yadda.  We could try to stop what's going on through legislation, boycott media conglomerates, etc.  It doesn't take a genius to know that you can't stop a speeding locomotive by force. We need to think creatively about these problems as we identify them. We need to back-burner our contempt for the George Bush's and Rupert Murdoch's of the world and channel our creativity into only positive endeavors. Crying over spilled milk will not get us any closer to our goal.  Furthermore, by embracing the creative mind we should feel free to share our ideas about content, distribution, advertising or technology issues. I'm suggesting a completely different approach to intellectual property. We need to share everything with each other, as closely guarding programming ideas and entrepreneurial insight is of the competitive mind and will only keep us from achieving what we set out. Have confidence that this is a revolution. Have confidence that your fellow revolutionaries care only for the cause and not to pad their wallets.  No idea will be stolen from you, for if it truly is a great idea and it is yours, we will ensure the credit goes where credit is due. This is not about money - if it were we'd all be in online porn or gaming. This is about taking back that which is ours, liberating our consciousness and helping our fellow man. Please share freely.  Very soon, I will post a business plan for a cable network I developed, as well as a plan for an on-demand version of it.  If these ideas have merit, certainly somebody could take them and run with it. All the better, I say! I know that there will be opportunites in this business to feed my family and that I need not take credit for every peice of work to do so. It would benefit the cause if everyone adapted this mindset.  Have faith that we are doing the right thing and that we will get our karmic desserts.  Sorry to ramble... bp

      This morning I was listening to NPR and they interviewed William Gibson, the guy that took the story of Annie Sullivan, the teacher who brought Helen Keller out of total darkness.  Fascinating. The television premier of "The Miracle Worker" won an Emmy - the adapted play won a Tony - the adapted movie won an Oscar.  Just goes to show you that real life triumphs are infinitely entertaining. Where have these stories gone? Most likely, they haven't gone anywhere - they just aren't at the forefront of media and entertainment. There's a little girl in Colorado who is petitioning the state government to ban circus animals in her state. This a story worth following and hopefully worth developing into film or television.  ************************************ Aug. 10, 2004  Tony-award winning playwright William Gibson penned The Miracle Worker. The story of Helen Keller -- who could not see, hear or speak -- is one of the world's most frequently performed plays. But Gibson, now 89, says most of the credit for his work belongs to the autobiography of Annie Sullivan, the teacher who opened the world to Keller. Pippin Ross reports.

      In 10-30 years, everyone will have broadband connectivity and a device, such as a cable set-top box, gaming unit (xbox, playstation) or other hardware which allows you to get content from a variety of sources on the internet and watch them on your television.  When the economics of doing this become reasonable 10-15 years, the strangehold that major conglomerates have on our viewing experiences will be lifted. We'll be able to watch what we want, when we want it and with as much or as little (and the right kind of) advertising. This will truly liberate us from being told what we should watch, rather the content will determine that. Good content will get watched, less desirable content will not and producers will be more in tuned with their customer as their customer no longer has channel or brand loyalty, just a desire to watch great content (drama, comedy, reality, etc.).  Technology is progressing in a very democratic fashion, allowing niche producers to host and stream their content over the internet for a nominal fee and allowing them to actually create a business model for their content.  For those of you a little fuzzy on video on demand in an IP environment, here's a little summary. After a peice of content is cast, directed, filmed, produced and edited, it ready to be watched. This final copy (no more creative work is required) is then encoded into a digital format. There are several formats, such as DVD or mpeg. Basically they convert the peice of media into ones and zeros such that all the video and audio may be easily reproduced and transmitted. Thus, you could copy a movie in the same way you could make a copy of an essay or a spreadsheet. It's all ones and zeros. Apple, Microsoft and Real all have media players which these ones and zeros can be played on. However, each of these requires a slightly different encoding format. Some argue the reason for this is differences technological / creative vision - others argue that is about competitive positioning and profit motive. Who's to say?  Anyways, it's relatively cheap to encode a peice of content, somewhere in the $5-10/minute. Per Moore's Law, this number will come down to pennies within 10 years. Encoding can also happen in a variety of ways. Essentially, the more bits (ones & zeros) encoded, the clearer and crisper the picture. On a 17" monitor, VHS quality entertainment can be encoded at about 500 kilobits per second. Using that same computer monitor, DVD quality entertainment can be encoded at about 1 megabit per second (1mbps ~ 2x 500kbps). So a great viewing experience requires more information to be encoded from the original source material.  Nice, so now what do you do with it. Well the way content is distributed in an IP (over the internet) happens in a variety of fashions. There is streaming media, which is when you have a super fat pipe (broadband or better) you click on the content link and it starts playing immediately through a media player (Apple, MSFT or Real). The ones and zero are literally flying off a big server somewhere and into your computer where they are decoded and displayed in a coherent video and audio entertainment experience.  The other prevalent way of distributing encoded content is via downloading. You click to download a peice of content and the ones and zero starting trickling in at whatever speed connectivity you have. A 2-hour movie can take as little as 30 minutes to download with a great connection. However in less optimal connectivity environments, it can take several hours. So you would have to have a pretty good idea of what you want to watch before you watched it. Very similar to the Netflix model where you order a couple DVD's online and they send them to you.  The cost of streaming is currently much higher than downloading, for obvious reasons. Fast is better and thus people are willing to pay more. Depending on the encoding rate and the volume streamed per month, it usually costs $1-3 to stream a movie, whereas downloading can be done for about $.50.  You'll also need to store this data on a server somewhere this too costs money, but not much. I'm ballparking, but enough storage space for a few hundred movies should cost more than a few hundred dollars a month. If anyone has current numbers please share!  One more thing is required. You need a user interface. These are also very cheap - you can get them from Real and MSFT for next to nothing. A user interface is essentially what the viewer sees when he wants to watch a movie. A UI allows a user to search and navigate through various peices of content and metadata, much in the same way you would search through your computer for files, you search a server somewhere for its files. But you need an easy way to do this. So some guy in San Fransisco writes a program that allows you to do this easily and effortlessly.  What was that word I used earlier? Metadata? Metadata is information that needs to be associated with the media file. It is data that the user interface uses to search for the content you want. So if I had a movie I wanted to show to my fans, in addition to setting up a user interface, relationships with an encoding and streaming partners, I'd also have to have metadata to identify and associate the media file with others. So I'd have the movie's actors, director, producers, synopsis, a peice of graphic art (movie poster) and a trailer (another media file that gives the viewer a preview of what they'll get). So after this is entered the movie can be searched, found, researched, previewed, and watched.  Also, most media players come with encryption/decryption techonology. So the content, after it's encoded will need to be encrypted so that you can't pass a copy of it to your buddy.  Another easy though necessary relationship to set up would be with a transaction clearing house such as Pay Pal.  As soon as prices come down (encoding, streaming, storage), everyone who makes a movie can sell it to you straight to your home. This will free the consumer from watching only watch network execs and movie studios want you to see.  Comments, questions?

      There is a computer strategy game that allows players to build a great civilization. Unlike other computer games of the past, the latest version, "Civilization III" allows you to win through achieving peace, prosperity and diplomacy. Although you can still set the game mode to win by conquest or win by achieving space flight before times runs out, this new feature introduces a whole new world of problem-solving. Essentially, it erases the competitive mindset and replaces it with a more creative and collaborative one where you trade commodoties, technologies and culture with other civilizations, increasing happiness, commerce and scientific achievement.  By focusing on collaboration, as opposed to military conquest, you do indeed build a great civilization. What actually ends up happening when you focus on the aforemention policies and tactics, you end up absorbing the other civilizations as they become awed by how well your society has progressed.  All the challenges of managing a government also exist, such as: monitoring fiscal policy, incentives for science, economic development, environmental sustainability, etc.  Net, net, it a fantastic game for children and adults, as play can be set at various levels. I highly recommend this game to anyone who thinks critically about the world and wants to see how they would affect change if given the reins. http://www.civ3.com  This is yet another fantastic use of mass media that entertains while engaging and educating it's player. Comments? Questions?

      Wallace Wattles wrote a book over a hundred years ago called "The Science of Getting Rich". Although the title sounds like a get rich scheme, it is anythin but. He ascerts that creating value and thereby wealth is the highest pursuit man can endeavor and that anyone can be value-add, wealthy, happy and fulfilled beyond their wildest imagination if they do things in a Certain Way.  I highly recommend this book, as it will bring you closer, be leaps and bounds, to your vision/dreams/goals. It is 50 pages and worth reading 2-3 times, the first with a highlighter. You can download it for free at http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/mediarevolucion/  Enjoy! Brandon

      There is fantastic organization called The Humanitas Prize. Their words are more powerful than mine. Please read.....  **************************************************** http://www.humanitasprize.org/index.html  In American culture at the present time, only the human family itself surpasses media's capacity to communicate values, form consciences, supply role models, and motivate human behavior.  Humanitas exists to encourage those who create contemporary media to use their immense power in a humanistic way, to enrich as well as entertain their viewers.  Enriching them means:  a) Giving them some piece of the truth about what it means to be a human being.  b) Challenging them to take charge of their lives and use their freedom in a responsible way.  c) Motivating them to reach out in respect and compassion to all their brothers and sisters in the human family.  We single out the writer for special attention because the value orientation of a story - what it says about the meaning and purpose of human life, about what's important and what's not - begins in his or her mind, heart, and psyche.  With this award, we seek to encourage the communication of those human values which will help its viewers grow and develop and become the fulfilled human beings God made them to be.  Human values are those which enable us to grow and develop and become fulfilled persons. We are not born fulfilled persons. We come to fulfillment only after we have discovered, decided and done certain things. But we are born with needs and desires which propel this rigorous and demanding process.  We gravitate toward reality so that we can extract its meaning. Just as our stomachs feed on food, our minds feed on the truth. And the rejoice in the light by which they discover it.  We desire the full flowering of our lives with a passion that sometimes surprises us. We want to develop our talents, actualize our potentialities and give what we have to give. We hunger for deep and personal communion with our fellow human beings. We want to give love. We want to receive it. We know we can realize th fullness of our humanity only with and through other people, not apart from them.  All human beings yearn for light, life and love. Somehow we know our fulfillment is bound up with satisfying this yearning.  Somehow we also know that in their fullness light, life and love are other names for that transcendent mystery in which we all live and move and have our being. Some people call this mystery God.  This, then is a tentative sketch of the process by which human beings become fulfilled persons. You can see how intrinsic values are to the whole process. As a writer, you can also see the artistic challenge involved:  To capture in story some small part of this fascinating process.  To get inside your characters as they grapple with its complexities  To so involve your viewers in the struggle that they grasp its meaning and put aside their fears.  By bringing to the creative process your own struggle for light, life and love, you can help your viewers progress in theirs.

      Below is the exec summary and mission of Humanity on Demand (HOD), a plan for a non-profit content aggregator and distributor of socially conscious and growth oriented programming, that I developed in business school. While the methodology and delivery may change, the impact of what I hope to accomplish (detailed in the summary and mission) will not. I would love to hear your thoughts on this!!  Full plan at  urlLink http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/mediarevolucion  *********************************************************   Executive Summary   HOD is a non-profit content aggregator and distributor that serves the socially conscious and growth oriented market that is starved for positive, uplifting and engaging programming.  HOD is an online entertainment and personal growth community.  HOD serves content to viewers who are wholly unsatisfied with the effect that consumerism and brand advertising has had upon American culture – those seeking an alternative to the bland, disengaging fare offered by current cable and satellite programmers.  HOD’s content showcases documentaries and positive uplifting series that cut across four main themes: Leadership & Human Spirit, Social Enterprise, Corporate Responsibility and Personal Growth &amp; Spirituality.       Mission  The media is a powerful force and whether or not we are conscious of it, it influences the way we think and act. It is no secret that due to this power, advertisers and large corporations sponsor television content to market their products and services in the name of reaching a wider customer base and increasing corporate profits. It has been argued that this phenomenon has helped create the current consumer culture we have today in the modern world.  Of particular import is the manner in which this phenomenon has woven itself through the fabric of our American culture. To a great extent, our society is comprised of individuals driven by the belief that they can only improve their condition by accumulating wealth and purchasing material goods. By incorporating this ideal, many believe that capitalist progress is the only worthwhile pursuit, as we seek to use the fruits of economics to improve our lives and social status. Moreover, brand and lifestyle advertising exploits our feelings of discontent (with our net worth, lack of approval, place in the pecking order, etc.) and provides a “simple” solution via the acquisition of material goods. This creates a situation where the accumulation of material goods is often deemed more important than anything else – a society where morality and compassion are frequently sacrificed in the pursuit of financial gain.  “I had it all. I had a stereo that was very decent, a wardrobe that was getting very respectable. I was close to being complete….. Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me. That condo was my life, okay? I loved every stick of furniture in that place. That was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed, it was ME!” - Narrator, ‘Fight Club’  Additionally, when we turn to mass media for news and diversion we see news and entertainment programming that sensationalizes the most negative aspects of society and ignores the most positive and humanitarian aspects, those which inspire and motivate. We see murder, rape, drug use, promiscuity, disaffected sarcasm and witless banter. Granted these programs hold our attention and allow us to tune out, however they are doing little but keeping us from engaging in infinitely more rewarding challenges. More importantly, this sort of programming leaves us with the feeling that our individual actions are useless when compared to the vast array of problems portrayed in the media. Many feel as if their life is meaningless and without purpose; they feel as if nothing they do will ever make a difference. In this case a life of hedonism is often the only logical choice.  “‘The past decade has produced vastly more social entrepreneurs than terrorists, but you would never know it by following the news.’" – FastCompany, January 2004, ‘Social Capitalists’ by Cheryl Dahle, quoting David Bornstein, author of How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas  The most striking example of how Hollywood is not fully meeting the desires and tastes of the country, is Mel Gibson’s recent blockbuster hit, “Passion”. Passion, the story of Jesus Christ’s last 12 hours, was created, scripted and produced with minimal artistic interpretation (sourcing the Bible). Due to luke warm interest in making the film, Mel Gibson had to make the movie for just $25 million, paling in comparison to the $40-60M industry average. It grossed $125 million in its first week and expected to reach $1B, by the time DVD’s are sold and rented. America wants programming with humanity, character and compassion that explodes off the scene and into our minds and souls.  Recognizing the existence of these issues is crucial to understanding the following proposal. After acknowledging these, there are really two things we can do as a society to remedy it: 1) Eliminate mass media from our daily lives or 2) Harness its power to make a positive impact on the world, specifically our American way of life.  Humanity On Demand is the first mass media endeavor which explicitly recognizes the ill effects of consumerism and lack of mindful challenge in American culture and expends every effort to communicate a powerful, humanitarian and uplifting message.   “We all start with preconceived notions of what we want from life. These include the basic needs programmed by our genes to ensure survival – the need for food, comfort, sex.... They also include the desires that our specific culture has inculcated in us – to be slim, rich educated, and well liked. If we embrace these goals and are lucky, we may replicate the ideal physical and social image for our historical time and place. But is this the best use of our psychic energy? …. we may discover that, contrary to what we were led to believe, it is more satisfying to help another person than to beat him down, or that it is more enjoyable to talk with one’s two-year old than to play golf with the company president.” - Flow, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

      Soooo, now that we know what's wrong with the world, at least from the perspective of mass media, what do we do about it? Well, if your business is selling ice, you would target the people who most want it, no? Likewise, being that our business is selling peace, prosperity, happiness and fulfillment, we would start with those who most want it. Who are they?  More important than classifying someone as peace-seeking or happiness seeking (afterall, doesn't everyone want more peace and happiness?), is identifying those already in a state of consciousness where they recognize these needs. I am of course talking about the LOHAS (Lifestyle of Health and Sustainability) segment.  A little on LOHAS.... http://www.lohasjournal.com/nbp/app/cda/nbp_cda.php?command=Page&pageType=About  LOHAS is an acronym that stands for Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability and describes a $226.8 billion U.S. marketplace for goods and services that appeal to consumers who value health, the environment, social justice, personal development and sustainable living. These consumers are variously referred to as Cultural Creatives or LOHAS Consumers and represent a sizable group in this country: approximately 30 percent of adults, or 63 million consumers (see the Understanding the LOHAS Market: Identifying the LOHAS Consumer and Business and Branding Opportunities report by clicking on Research on the navigation bar to the left).  Environmental concerns, human health and human rights do not completely configure the LOHAS Consumer, however. There is more. The holistic worldview of the LOHAS Consumer believes in the interconnectedness of global economies, cultures, environments and political systems but also in the interconnectedness of mind, body and spirit within individuals in order to achieve full human potential. Personal Development is of utmost concern to LOHAS Consumers. Spirituality is no longer relegated to the New Age periphery but has immigrated to the center.  The LOHAS marketplace was originally identified by research conducted by Natural Business Communications, publisher of the Natural Business LOHAS Journal, in 2000 and is made up of five sectors: Within these five market divisions are products and services that improve health, safeguard eco-systems, develop human potential in a sustainable manner, reduce the use of natural resources, allow mankind and the natural world to live more harmoniously, and are created or conducted in a socially just manner.  “If the machine inspired the industrial age, the image of the living system may inspire a genuine postindustrial age,” say Peter Senge et al., in Sloan Management Review.  The five LOHAS categories include:   Sustainable Economy  Green building and industrial goods Renewable Energy Resource-efficient products Socially responsible investing Alternative transportation Environmental management  Healthy Living  Natural, organic and nutritional products Food and beverage Dietary supplements Natural personal care products  Alternative Healthcare  Health and wellness solutions Acupuncture, homeopathy, naturopathy, etc. Holistic disease prevention Complementary medicine  Personal Development  Mind, body and spirit products: CDs, books, tapes, seminars Yoga, fitness, weight loss Spiritual products and services  Ecological Lifestyles  Ecological home and office products Organic/recycled fiber products Environmentally friendly appliance Eco-tourism and travel  Understanding the LOHAS marketplace helps companies grasp the interconnection of consumer values across product categories--the common values that serve a greater idea of a holistic lifestyle as a global and a local citizen. The opportunities for business are immense, from the development of new types of channels that can better service LOHAS consumers to the invention of cleaner products and technologies. Opportunities exist for businesses to discover like-minded industries with which to evolve new partnerships such as the new green hotels have done with the eco-travel industry. Forging these types of links will ultimately produce new systems of distribution, new outlets for sales, and new technologies for cleaner production. ****************************************  OK, so this is a powerful group. Given the size of this group, one would expect them to exert tremendous influence over political, economic, media and social affairs. However this group is anything but united. Uniting this group is the key to the survival of our species and the planet as a sustainable living environment. The LOHAS Journal is making sizable strides in this arena, but they've only begun.  What I am hoping to do is to give this group yet another way to connect and communicate with each other. By using the power of film & television, I would like to bring this group together to discuss important issues and tactics for resolving them. My goal is to create an entertainment portal that allows the viewer to watch whatever he wants, whenever he wants it. Merging the functionality of a traditional video on demand service, such as moviefly or cinemanow with the community building tools of geocities/frienster/ryze/linkedin, etc., a new virtual meeting place will emerge.  More later...

      As you might have noticed, I rearranged the blog a bit. I took all the posts that had to do with the current state of the media industry and moved them all to one post "UPDATED - STATE OF MEDIA". I did this because I was getting downright bummed out. And depressing myself, or you all, is not the intent.  From this point forward I will post (with your help and consent) only creative and positive thoughts. There's no use crying over spilled milk. While it's important to be informed and understand what is happening to us, there are several existing sources for this information.  I'm really excited about the following areas of development (as always seeking more good ideas):  1. IP VOD non-profit content aggregator. Allows VOD over the internet for socially responisble programming initially targeted at the LOHAS market. Empowers film makers and producers to distribute their content to a wider audience in an on-demand environment.  2. Media Awareness Eduction initiatives. Teaching/training kids & adults to understand the media and advertising messages constantly and indescriminantly being delivered to them.  3. Documentaries and fiction peices that are entertaining, yet provoking and empowering. Provide opportunities for the production and distribution of great content such as , "What the !@#$ do we know?", "The Illuminators", etc.  The intent of these initiatives, esp #1 & #3, is to unite cultural creatives, aka the LOHAS (Lifestyle of Health and Sustainability) market segment. I want to unite and empower this group above all else, as they possess the vision and ability to make this world a better place. The current impediment is a lack of leadership, geographic spread and loss of hope.   Looking forward to empowering with you!!! Best, Brandon

      This is a fantastic Canadian company that seems to have the long-term well-being of Canadians in mind. They own the Documentary Channel, as well as several children/family oriented programming entities. Please check them out. http://www.corusent.com ********************************************* Corus Entertainment is one of Canada’s most successful integrated media and entertainment companies. Built from the media assets originally owned by Shaw Communications Inc., and spun off as a separate, publicly-traded company in 1999, our asset base has grown remarkably through strategic acquisitions and strong operating discipline. Corus Entertainment stock is found on the TSX under the symbol CJR.B and on the NYSE under CJR. The JR Shaw family controls the majority of Corus Entertainment's voting shares.  The many companies and businesses that make up Corus Entertainment deliver compelling, engaging, interactive and informative content to millions of consumers every day.   Our television services include: YTV, Treehouse TV, W Network, TELETOON (40%), Discovery Kids, CMT, Telelatino, The Documentary Channel and SCREAM; western Canada’s exclusive pay-TV movie service on six thematic channels under the Movie Central brand; three local over-the-air television stations; Digital ADventure advertising services for television and Max Trax, a residential subscription digital music service.   We also boast the strongest collection of radio assets in the country, 50 stations clustered in major markets, reaching more people than any other radio group. Nearly one-third of all Canadians tune to a Corus radio station each week for the best in talk, rock, country and contemporary radio formats.   Nelvana, one of the world’s leading creators, producers and distributors of animated programming and related consumer products for such globally recognized brands as Babar, Franklin and Beyblade, is the cornerstone of our content and production strategy. Canada’s leader in children’s publishing – Kids Can Press – is another part of the Corus family. Outside Canada, the Company holds a 50 per cent interest in The Locomotion Channel, a specialty television service programming animation to over seven million subscribers in Latin America.   Together, these powerful entertainment assets are achieving results that make Corus an industry leader in Canada and significant player in the international marketplace. Our success means a stronger Canadian broadcasting industry, a stronger economy and stronger communities across Canada.   Each year, the power and reach of Corus’ broadcasting assets work to assist local organizations, charities and people in need through millions of dollars worth of donated air-time and services, local fundraising and cash support. Through radio play for new Canadian singers and songwriters, the acquisition, development and production of numerous Canadian television projects and millions of dollars of direct investment in Canadian film production, Corus Entertainment is helping to build a sustainable and vibrant entertainment industry that is truly Canadian and globally competitive.   At Corus, our vision is to be globally recognized as Canada’s most influential entertainment company. We’re achieving that vision with the hard-work and commitment of our talented employees, many of whom are award-winners in their fields. The Shaw family’s commitment to customers, communities and employees is reflected in Corus Entertainment’s corporate values:  Knowledge We believe in continuous learning and the sharing of our insights and ideas.   Innovation We are committed to creative thinking that leads to breakthrough ideas and superior results.   Initiative We empower employees to make great things happen.   Teamwork We believe that the greatest value is realized when we work together.   Accountability We do what we say we’ll do – no excuses.   These values shape our day-to-day business and our strategies for growing Corus Entertainment in the future. We will continue to grow – in strength and profitability – by maximizing the synergies of our world-class assets, drawing on the exceptional talent and creativity of our employees and offering the highest-quality programming, products and services to our audiences and customers.

      Check these guys out. They are a grassroots organization that is trying to fund intiatives to take back the media. Hell or highwater, I'm going to get in touch with them. http://www.mediaventure.org  ********************************************* "We want the airwaves, baby!"   -- the Ramones  Media Venture Collective is fund of the Rudolf Steiner Foundation, focused on aggregating donations and grants, small and large, into "program-related investments" in high-impact, public-interest media enterprises.   It is a new approach to financial mobilization, part venture fund, part community foundation, part social network, part collective intelligence, and 100% focused on supporting thriving public-benefit media enterprises that can be to monopoly media what Linux is to Microsoft.

      This is awesome! This is a site provides some fantastic documentaries and educational videos. Currently they're only available on VHS and DVD, for institutional customers. They cost around $1-200. This is the sort of content that I'm talking about!!! These are empowering, thought-provoking. It would not take very much effort to make these available in an on-demand format over the web. Please check them out!!! http://www.mediaed.org

      A fantastic company with an amazing mission - educate through entertainment. They're backed by billionaire, Philip Anschutz. Please check them out!!! http://www.walden.com  ****************************************************** The Inspiration  A Walden Media project begins with compelling source material, like a book that kids, their parents, teachers, and community leaders already love and admire. Many recent and current productions are based on classic books like The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe or recent award-winning novels such as Holes and Because of Winn-Dixie. Other productions are inspired by “real-life” stories like deep-sea exploration or the incredible career of Jim Thorpe.  The Talent  Our production department then selects the right creative team to bring the story to life. The directors, cast, and crew who work on Walden Media films, television, and theatre are among the most respected in their field, including both Academy Award® winning veterans and notable newcomers. Many have personal connections with stories they are telling – the movie may be based on a favorite book from childhood or a story that their own kids have enjoyed reading.  The Foundation As production gets underway, our in-house education specialists assess how this particular movie or show might spark excitement in the classroom. We partner with teachers, museums, and national organizations to develop a comprehensive educational program that delves into a wide range of topics and appeals to different learning styles.   We offer in-class teaching tools like activity guides, discussion topics, and enhanced DVDs. We sponsor special field trips and events – for example, a robot-building competition or writing workshop simultaneously broadcast to movie theaters around the country. Directors, writers, and stars of our productions participate in these events. We also provide seminars and forums for teachers to discuss their craft and to trade ideas on using media in the classroom.   Like all educators, our goal is to instill lifelong enthusiasm for learning.

      Channel G is everything that's right with humanity. The idea really demonstrates the power of the medium of televison. Docu-reality network that profiles socially conscious ventures and non-profit projects. Please check them out!! http://channelg.tv *************************************  Channel G designs, purchases, and distributes inviting television and web content showcasing the environmental, social, and health-related projects of non-profit organizations.   With Channel G, the American television viewing public is educated and informed while getting the opportunity to participate in the success of great projects. Channel G highlights the projects' efficacy and scientific and educational value, as well as the personal stories of the people involved.   A major component of Channel G's presentation is the invitation to the viewers to participate through financial contributions to the projects they see on Channel G. Most Americans want to participate in making the world a better place, but do not have an easy avenue of access to do so. With its combination of television and web content, Channel G is the link; it's the nexus point where people, projects, and resources come together.   Channel G's modular television production allows for the production of shows of any length, including half-hour or hour time slots. The Channel G show format can be extended to a full-time network. Channel G can be broadcast on satellite, cable, or streaming video.  The vast majority of Americans have access to either a television set or a computer; hence, Channel G serves people of every geographic, socioeconomic, and ethnic persuasion and presents a model with few barriers to participation. Channel G serves its constituency by presenting content covering a wide range of non-profit projects while providing mainstream America with an easy and effective way to participate in these projects directly.

      Fantastic program on Good Life TV called "Volunteers: For the Sake of Others". Another solid peice of programming that needs more distribution. http://www.goodtv.com/program.php?programid=VL *****************************************  This is a series that portrays a completely opposite view of America reflected on the news every night. We see images of violence, fear, greed, hopelessness and helplessness, but that is not the real America. The real spirit of America is one of strength and hope, of reaching out to others; individual Americans helping their neighbor, their community, their country.  Hosted by veteran journalist, Doris McMillon, this series was created to help tell the stories of those who quietly give their time and talents to helping their fellow Americans. And it is not as hard as you think for you to help, for this series is also aimed at encouraging and inspiring you to volunteer, in what ever way you can. As President Bush has said, “Through the gathering momentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness, we can overcome evil with greater good.”
