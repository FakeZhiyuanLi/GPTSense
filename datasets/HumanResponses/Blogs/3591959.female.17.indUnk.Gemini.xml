        Hello everyone... Wed and Thursday were some of the funniest and craziest days of my life, only because Janelle was at my house haha oh my goodness, who ever thought that you could find two movies with transvestites in them??? certainly not I, but we did and it was great fun lol... And of course more quotes developed out of this...   My sweet dick- Dodgeball guy lol  I'm too hott for this room- Me  Only transvestites would turn corners like that- Me  I looove your suit- Hannibal Lector- copied by me and Janelle  Alright well those quotes were great but I just wanted to add another realization I came to... what is up with all these uber sensitive people in my life?? I tell ya... and a lot of them are guys... guys a word of advice sometimes could u just be... gruff??? hehehe cuz this sensitivity crap is wearing a little thin...

      Hey, This isn't really one of those dumb blog things it's just something where I can put good times, or amazingly funny quotes that me and my friends have or think up... and everyone who cares can read them, or not... but hey it will give u something to do or make fun of!! woo hoo  Here's a few gems of wisdom from my friend Janelle:  "You're a pedophile waiting to happen"  "It takes two to tango it takes three to manague" (don't know how to spell it but she knows hehe)  "Erin! You have so much more to live for!"  "Hey, gay light's on!!"  "Con PJ!!!!"
