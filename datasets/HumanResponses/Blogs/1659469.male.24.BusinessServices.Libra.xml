      Heres something to really screw with you.  urlLink Feed The Children  See its this easy in about 10 minutes you can save the life of a starving child, maybe help save the next Picasso or Aristotle. So seeing how you could skip a few meals at McDonalds and give a child some water and bread what are you going to do? Not only that but what kind of person does it make you if you don't give, was it the person you thought you were or were you just a little more petty than you thought, perhaps a little more greedy, maybe you just love McDonalds that much. An evil trick I know but it should make you look closely at yourself, thats the goal.

      Yeah so like I said I'm a philosophy minor, man this stuff really cooks my noodle I tell you. Yesterday I sat for an hour or two (ok I'm lying, I only set for a few minutes, I lie alot, don't know why I just do.. don't lecture me =) ) and thought that maybe everything that happens is supposed to happen, though I've never really been a fatalist or stoic or any of that, a bit of an existentialist if anything. Then I wondered if maybe its not set to happen in any certain pattern, what if its just supposed to happen, one way or another sometime in your life, like a comma splice. If thats true though you have to wonder if there is a God, or god however you prefer. I am not christian... I figure if Jesus did live he was probably a pretty nice guy a bit like Siddartha Guattama but nothing more. Just another guy who wanted everyone to get along and ended up getting publicly executed for it. You ever wonder about that, why everyone who promotes peace and harmony gets knocked off. Perhaps we as humans aren't capable of truly realizing peace and harmony, we are way to into catergorical living. What I mean by that is we thrive on categories (its fixing to get deep I did a term paper on this theory of mine so hold on tight) See what I say is that because of the very nature of the human mind we try despretly to catergorize everything around us, including everyone. By setting categories we get a general feeling of direction for ourselves and thereby are able to cope with day to day activities because we know WHO we are, at least in the categorical sense. So when we hear people talking about wanting to be in harmony with each other, that we are all the same and that we are all everything we snap, we simply can't handle it. We are being asked to strip away everything we have been taught is us (our social status, hair color, race, creed, weight, skin tone) our whole life and understand that we are all the same, just with different melatonin levels. HOLY SHIT noooo what the hell am I without my social standing! Have you noticed that High School is setup to stratify the youth, to slowly push and pull them into their predisposed categories? Really do you think someone who is  a "prep" is really any different than a "punk". Get off your highhorse, we're all tools, or at least have been. What has to be relized is that the station you are likely in now was what you were bred for, look deep at yourself and figure out if its really what you want or if its whats expected of you (don't go all afternoon special on this either, most punks are expected to be that way, its the way the teachers and parents have unwittingly made them) Thats what you have to understand if you claim a label of somesort or even half heartedly you are fooling yourself, you're no better than anyone else and certainly no wiser. Me I'm nothing, I'm not wise and I know I don't know anything of any great importance. Socrates taught me that. Socrates is another one of those great men/women that got the shit can in public, having to sip sip on the old hemlock cocktail. Hmm ok nuff of this.

      yup so this is my first blog. i should feel special i guess but mostly i feel like i need to work on my capitilization. Ok there we go. Hmm well what to say what to do. I want to build a bike, a motorcycle that is. I just got this silly notion in my head a few minutes ago and that was what I was surfing for when I found a link to a blog and then I remembered an article I had read so I followed through and ended up typing this with my stumpy little fingers. I guess they are not that stumpy, though I am. Damn I'm short 5 foot 7 , I'm 23 so I think my growth spurts are all spurted out, oh well. I'm so indesicive(sp) this will be the 3rd time I am going to change majors, first I was an Art major, then an English major now I think I'm going to be an Anthropolgy major, mostly cause I want to dig up dead people and crack whips and all. Not really, I just like history and I think anthropolgy/archeology/minor in philosophy will let me use all of my MANY AND VARIED TALENTS (think of a real booming voice when you read that, its funnier) Yeah so anyway I'm changing to Anthropology. I dunno where its gonna get me but hey who cares right, I mean I'll end up working at a wal-mart or something anyway.  yup

      Hmm ok So it's been 11 months .. almost a year since I last posted. Hmmm Ok now I lost my job because I called my boss dead weight, .. well she did ask. So I'm was unemployed for along time... 9 months to be exact. I just got a job making good money I think. So that's better, I'm burnt on school but I'm gonna get it finished anyway. Ok I might try and make this a regular thing, maybe start cataloging my draems or some mess. I need a scanner and I'd post drawings or something. I dunno maybe I'll get some bad ass shit when I start making money. I would like that bad ass shit is always good to have. Okie now I'm not gonna type anymore I think. I'm going back to browse orkut.
