      Finally! I have moved most of everything over to blogger! There are some new features here. I have of course the desktop cam! But I have removed the TV cam for now and I have added a WebCam! Now you can take a little more depth look into my&nbsp;world..&nbsp;Which is most cases isn't much LOL I am still adding some features to the blog. I have some more links to put up and some of my favorite sites I visit as well. &nbsp; I will be also be putting together a Linux help section for tips and tricks for n00bies and some server stuff too. I will also be adding some Modeling graphics sometime in the future as I get more into that. I will also be posting all of the great art work I make I will be getting a deviantart account so I can put everything in one place.   I guess that's it for now! I am sure I will be adding tons of content to the site once I remember what it is ;)

      Well my format and reinstall and install of slackware didn't happen, I will waiting till sometime next week to do it. I have to burn some stuff off of my drive before formatting. I am really torn between slackware 10 and SUSE 9.1 I will hopefully make my choice before I format. I am also going to be only updating my blog at night as I hope to soon have a job working for Dell in the service department here in the new place they opened up here. So wish me luck!
