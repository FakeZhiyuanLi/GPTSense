      In this blog I'll be posting many things.  Ramblings, links to interesting articles I've read, stuff I've written.  I've always wanted to be a writer, and somehow the internet has made it easier for me to be comfortable with the fact that for this to happen in any form, people have to actually read what you write.  Strange, but true.

      There are two very good reasons why I will never have children.  1)The smell of the baby aisle at the grocery store almost makes me physically ill.  It sounds horrible, and I don't mean to offend anyone with kids, but the smell of baby powder and formulas seriously makes me want to run in the other direction.  2)When my mom and I had to vacate the house for an Open House Sunday afternoon, we took Nikki (our 11 month old beagle) with us.  I know children and pets aren't the same thing, but the amount of baggage we had to carry with us, and the fact that we couldn't just get up and go, bothered me.  If I want to go, I want to go  right now , not when the baby is ready.  Call me shallow, callous, or just a flat out bitch, but I do not want kids.  I want to be free to live my life how I please, without worry or obligation to anyone.  When my mom tells me her co-workers this, they all say, "Oh, just wait until she finds the right guy."  She knows me well enough to say, "Well, to her the right guy would want the same exact things - including no kids!"  After this little mini-rant, I will say that I have come up with some names, in case the co-workers are right and one day the right man comes along to turn me into a babymaking machine.  Girl: Hannah, Scarlett  Boy: Keith, Gavin

      Check out  urlLink this  terrific article by Michael Musto, who many of you out there know from  urlLink The Village Voice , but to a whole new generation of pop culture junkies, his many appearances on television as a talking head.  Great stuff, check it out.

      I wasn't happy with the old  urlLink blog , so I've decided to start anew.  Hope I can make the perfectionist in me happy with this one.

      For those of you savvy with all of this blogging stuff... I would like to post a link here, for donations for my  urlLink heart walk . I'd like it to be separate from my favorite links, so how would I go about doing that? Much thanks in advance!  First thing today, I got up and headed straight for the local branch of the  urlLink Michigan Democratic Party  to get the tickets for the John Kerry appearance tomorrow. I'm going with Dad, so it'll make for good bonding. The tickets say there will be a barbecue and softball game, probably before his scheduled 7:00p.m. appearance.  Teresa's name was on the ticket also, so I was excited about that. Good times, I can't wait!

      I don't know about you, but I felt really good after listening to John Kerry speak last night. I felt full of hope for the future, and excited about what's to come. The only complaint I'd have to make about his speech was that he didn't mention his 19 years in the Senate, but hopefully he will use the rest of the time up until the election to elaborate on that (also, on a few other things such as his plans). Other than that, it was terrific. So, if I wasn't pumped up enough after this week, this morning Mom e-mails me to tell me that he will be in town Sunday night. I am so going to this, because it's something you don't get to do every day, and I want to see him in person and see for myself how well he translates from a tv screen. If anyone else in the Detroit area is going to this, I'd love to find out.

      - October 2nd, my Mom and I are going to participate in the  urlLink 2004 Metro Detroit Heart Walk , sponsored by the  urlLink American Heart Association .  I am helping raise funds for our group, so if any one would like to donate, please e-mail me (info is in my blogger  urlLink profile ) and let me know.  My Dad first had congestive heart failure in the summer of 1996; he collapsed during my great-uncle's funeral and was rushed to the hospital.  Since then, he has had a few more episodes and in March of this year, had to get a defibulator implanted.  Though some of you know my ongoing issues with my Dad, he is a good guy deep down, and it hurts me to see him with such a stressful disease.  Any donations, well wishes, or both, will be much appreciated.

      For the last couple of weeks, I have been without music.&nbsp; Oh, I still have my 500 plus CDs pouring out from every corner of my room, tapes I haven't listened to in years tucked away in a tape case behind my mountainous CD towers, and access to radio in my car (albeit crappy "owned by Clear Channel so therefore every station has the same playlist" radio).&nbsp; I just haven't been listening to any of it.&nbsp;   I needed a break from music.&nbsp; It's a crazy notion, especially if you know me at all.&nbsp; I live for music; I have to have it on every possible second of every day.&nbsp; I grew up with a love of rock and roll, thanks to my freewheelin', jumpin' jack flash, why don't you take another little piece of my heart, purple haze and gold rush loving father.&nbsp; I have been to countless concerts, counting almost each and every one of them a great memory from my life.&nbsp; I buy CDs at a breakneck pace, and for my favorite artists&nbsp;I am&nbsp;there at the local shop the day their new discs are released.&nbsp; I am a groupie, er, a  Band-Aid  in practically every sense of the word.&nbsp; I support music 100%.&nbsp; But I've had to take a break from all of that glorious noise, just to straighten my head out again.   In some ways I've felt that music has been distracting me from considering what I need to think about at this point in my life.&nbsp; That too many times I can be lifted too high into the clouds by a  urlLink Bruce Springsteen   soap opera , or dragged too deep into the depths of despair by a haunting  urlLink Wilco  melody.&nbsp; I need to sort some things out for myself, with no help from the songs I've come to love and form a deep attachment to over my 26 years.   OK, I do have a confession to make:&nbsp; I haven't gone as far off the deep end as one would like to think.&nbsp; I can't go completely cold turkey.&nbsp; At work I have on, at  urlLink "a reasonable volume"  WCSX, our local classic rock station (which still has basically the same playlist, despite having over 50 years of classics to choose from), and when I workout in the evenings I flip around the stations on my discman.&nbsp; But it's all fluff, nothing I really attach myself to.   I'm sure that once I lift the weight of the world off of my shoulders I'll feel better, and ready to take on my massive&nbsp;CD collection again.&nbsp; It's just now I have other fish to fry.

       A few random notes to begin the day:  -  urlLink Teresa Heinz Kerry  has just about put me over the edge.  I am this much closer to doing something I've never done before: ordering bumper stickers and signs for a candidate and, you know, actually  endorsing  a candidate.  I've never had blind faith in anyone I've ever voted for, trust me, and this time is no different.  However, I do agree with John Kerry on many of the issues, and from what I've read and seen of her, and especially after her speech last night (where she came across as strong, likeable, warm, and with a sense of humor), I really find myself liking Teresa as well.   - Good (political) website to check out:  urlLink Wonkette  (brought to you by the wickedly good people of  urlLink Gawker )  OK, I'll stop with the politics for now (you'd think I'd learn a little from being such a  urlLink U2  fan for all these years, heh).  The other night I helped Mom get some clothes together for the garage sale.  We just had one two years ago, but now with her possibly moving and my definitely moving, we decided it was time to de-clutter all over again.  This time, I am getting rid of a TON of clothes.  Some of them I've been holding on to for way too long.  I really believe in all of that cleansing of the soul stuff, that when you get rid of certain things it helps pave the way for more positive energy.  So, in getting things together to sell next weekend, I have been tossing bits of stuff from years ago into boxes, hoping that it will all be bought up so I can get on with my life.  And speaking of moving, I'm going after work to fill out an application for that apartment I looked at Sunday.  It means I'll be put on the waiting list, and will hopefully be moving in come October.  So, yay! :)

      I have just one word to say about last night's speech by  urlLink Bill Clinton .  Wow.  Today is a boring, crappy, rainy day in Michigan, so there may be updates throughout the day, as I'll be doing a lot of reading in between nodding off and working. *wink*   Update #1:  1:13 p.m. - Have just finished lunch, a Michelina's garden bistro with gnocchi and cheese sauce.  One hundred and eighty calories and five grams of fat, not bad!  OK, before I get all Briget Joneslike and start obsessing about calories and scales (at least in here) I'll go onto other things.   Saw Mr. Boy (big eyeroll) in the lobby a few minutes ago and rode with him, in silence, on the elevator back to our floor.  You know, I got over the fact that you didn't want to date me almost a year ago.  Grow up and at least apologize for being such a dumbass of a human being.  (Notice I didn't say man, well, because you're technically not - which is why I'm glad I got over my initial attraction - but yeah, I've vowed not do the man-bashing thing anymore.  At least for today I won't. Hand to God, honest.)   Update #2:  The low-carb craze is  urlLink over .   Or, at least it's waning.  Good news for those of us who prefer eating a healthy balance of all kinds of foods, instead of munching away on bacon and chalky Atkins candy bars.  OK, that's all, folks.  God, that was boring.

      Maybe it's because I'm bored.&nbsp; Maybe it's because I need something to look forward to.&nbsp; Maybe it's because I need a cause.&nbsp; Maybe it's simply that I don't want to become the &nbsp;"stupid, lazy American" that so many other countries see us as.&nbsp; Maybe it's because I'm angry with the way things have been run around here the past four years, and want everyone around me to know it.&nbsp; OK, that last thing?&nbsp; That's not a maybe; it's a definite.&nbsp;   I've been reading everything I can get my hands on about the upcoming election.&nbsp; I have been watching the nightly news, &nbsp;looking at polls (which, I know, essentially don't mean shit) and watching  urlLink MSNBC .&nbsp; Last night's special on  urlLink John Kerry  vs. President Nixon was&nbsp;particularly interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I loved watching all of the old footage from  urlLink The Dick Cavett Show , when it seemed as if the young people were so passionate for change.&nbsp; I look at what the  urlLink MTV  generation has come to define now, and it scares me.&nbsp; Britney worshipping, X-box playing kids who just care who's on TRL today?&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I think about my friends and I back then, when we were hockey obsessed nuts who loved watching MTV (back when they actually played videos).&nbsp; Hopefully this new generation of spoiled brats come to realize how important they are, or will be, once 2008 rolls around.   I&nbsp;was&nbsp;14 when Bill Clinton was first elected President.&nbsp; We had a mock election in my high school, and, not surprisingly, he won by a landslide.&nbsp; I remember asking my parents why they couldn't lower the voting age, since all of us (spoiled, MTV loving) kids had gotten it so right.&nbsp; Four years later, I went with my Dad to the church a few blocks away from our house and I voted for Clinton again, this time for real.&nbsp; It felt so good to be a part of something as&nbsp;huge as a Presidential election, but four years later when that time rolled around again, I wasn't as excited.&nbsp; I voted, but it just didn't feel the same.&nbsp; The newness and novelty of it had worn off.&nbsp;&nbsp; And when the vote didn't go my way, I was disappointed the way one would be when their  urlLink favorite hockey team  loses the Stanley Cup (which, coincidentally, had really happened to me only the year before).&nbsp; I couldn't believe it.&nbsp; I wanted a recount.&nbsp; I wanted to believe it was all just a bad dream.&nbsp; Where were all of those smart 14 year olds now?&nbsp;   This year, the excitement is back.&nbsp; We as a country need change, or we're going to suffocate.&nbsp; I plan on doing my part, by educating myself on all of the issues, advertising (see a previous entry for my t-shirt purchase), and most importantly, voting on November 2nd.&nbsp; Are you going to do yours?

      I looked at a few apartments this morning with Mom.  One in particular stood out.  It was in a nice area, still not too far from work, with all new kitchen cabinets and carpeting, and charges only an extra $15 a month for cats.  If I want to be put on the waiting list now would be the time to get in an application, so I'll probably go ahead and fill one out next week.  So scary, yet so exciting!  I really am anxious and excited to be moving out on my own, but I'm worried that I'll always be broke.  Which I'm sure is a realistic concern, but after running through an "imaginary" budget with Mom countless times, I should do OK.  I just don't want to end up struggling like some of my friends have.  Anyway...  Over the last two years I've been buying things here and there for when I move (kitchen table and chairs, clocks, a magazine rack, etc.), but I have a short list of what I still need before the Big Move.  Two of those things I got this weekend.  One was an  urlLink eBay  find, this  urlLink gorgeous shower curtain and hooks set .   The other, my  urlLink bedding set  from Target (pronnounced, "Tar-chay", hehe).  Every week I've been checking the website and, when I make my twice-a-month Target runs, the bedding aisle, and today when I saw the little red "sale" under all of the Bella Wisteria collection my heart skipped a few beats.  Within minutes, I got my confirmation from target.com telling me the comforter set, bedskirt, sheets, and two throw pillows would be on its way to me shortly.  Woohoo!  I haven't had bedding I've liked literally in years, so hey, this is a big deal to me, OK?  On a sidenote (yeah, right), I've just begun reading  urlLink Confessions of a Shopaholic , by Sophie Kinsella.  I don't salivate at the mere sight of a ridiculously expensive scarf (okay, more like handbag), but from what I've read so far it pretty well mirrors my own life, in certain ways.  Talk about scary.  But, I feel okay about my purchases this weekend, because they are things I really do  need , instead of things I  want , which is what usually gets me in trouble.   I'm getting better, though.  I woke up this morning contemplating buying some of the things on my wish list, you know, sort of a last mega-entertaintment spending blitz before I have to start buckling down and all that crap.  I figured a few dvd boxed sets would run me close to $100, then immediately reconsidered, thinking how that $100 could easily go towards a microwave and a toaster, or towards a nice vaccum.  God, how I miss the recklessness of my youth.

      I just bought one of  urlLink these  shirts, from  urlLink Clothing of The American Mind .&nbsp; Now I'm eagerly waiting it's arrival, so I can wear it every chance I get to spread the word.  Today has been nice so far.&nbsp; I sweated out to a new Denise Austin dvd, took  urlLink Nikki  for a walk around the neighborhood, and later today, Dad and I are going to meet up for lunch.&nbsp; I'm also going to go get myself a mani/pedi - I&nbsp;figure I deserve one. :)&nbsp; I've been kind of depressed all week so maybe today with all of it's&nbsp;pleasantries will ease me out of it.  That's about all that's happening here.&nbsp; Have a great Saturday, all!

        6:00 a.m. - Wake up, roll over, hit the snooze button.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rinse, lather, repeat for the next 45 minutes.&nbsp; During this time, I will drift in and out of consciousness as Mia deliberately jumps on and off my bladder,&nbsp;torturing me and meowing to be let out of my room at the same time.  6:45 a.m. - Get my tired ass out of bed.&nbsp; Fill Mia's food and water dish, then make own breakfast (usually consisting of either cornflakes with slices of banana on top, or two slices of peanut butter toast).&nbsp; Go back to room, sit in dark while eating and&nbsp;listening to morning radio.  7:00 a.m - Get ready and dressed for work.  7:50-8:10 a.m. - Read a bit before having to get on with my morning commute.&nbsp; This morning's selection:  Dress Your Family In Corduroy & Denim  by David Sedaris.  8:15 -8:30 a.m. - Zone out while driving to work.&nbsp; Cars zip by as&nbsp;I try to remember what life was like before I&nbsp;began working in an office.&nbsp; Jobs at Farmer Jack and Hallmark seem lifetimes ago now, when you could wake up at noon, work four hours, and consider that a good day's work in your warped little 18 or 19 year old mind.&nbsp; Visions of myself in&nbsp;denim skirts, holding a  Batman Forever  McDonald's cup filled to the brim with Country Time Pink Lemonade as I drive to the movies with my three best friends at the time, the summer stretching before us like a piece of Silly Putty on newspaper,&nbsp;sustain me until I pull into my usual spot in the parking lot.&nbsp;  8:30 a.m. - Push the "On" button on my little black Dell computer, sit down, begin my work day.&nbsp;   8:35 a.m. - Am already hassled about something.&nbsp; Think to self what a long day it will be.  8:45 a.m. - Click on the internet that we're supposed to use for "business use only"; use it to read blogs, the news, celebrity gossip, and to add more things to my wish list.   10:30a.m. - Chatter with co-workers (this will sometime include meaningful, "let's kill some time" chats with the evil co-worker - sometimes it's nice to have a common goal) before heading down to the store for bottles of water and, for me, a piece of fruit.  12:00 p.m. - Lunchtime!&nbsp; Eat at my desk while openly surfing the 'net, or reading a book.&nbsp;   1:00 p.m. - Go downstairs, visit with my friends on three before going to get the mail.  2:00 p.m. - Mid-afternoon workday slump.&nbsp; Drift off into Fantasyland.&nbsp;&nbsp;There, I am the Queen of my own empire, never having to work a day in my life, and  urlLink James Franco ,  urlLink Jon Stewart , and  urlLink Jack White  are all there to do my bidding.&nbsp; Jon and I are in a passionate discussion about politics when Jack saunters up, reminding me about our three o' clock "private" guitar lesson.&nbsp; I open my mouth to say something but just then James comes up behind me, puts his hands over my eyes, says "Boo!" and whisks me away for a ride on his new Harley.   5:00 p.m. - Having just spent the last three hours between Fantasyland and my real life, I am utterly exhausted.&nbsp; Leave work, go the back route home, which is usually free of any of the mess I'd find if I took the freeway.  5:15 p.m. - Walk in the door.&nbsp; Peel off workclothes in favor of shorts and a t-shirt.&nbsp; Reaquaint myself with the animals and talk with Mom.&nbsp;   6:00 p.m. - Eat dinner, watch a little tv.&nbsp; Lately I've been really into the   urlLink Nightly News With Tom Brokaw  (sitting in tonight, Brian Williams).&nbsp;    7:00 p.m. - Pull on old, dirty Nike sneakers.&nbsp; Workout.&nbsp; This is the only thing I do all day that I feel benefits me in any way.  8:00 p.m. - Shower.&nbsp; Think about how nice it'll be to have my own place.&nbsp; That,&nbsp;after&nbsp;26 years I deserve it, and that I'd have had it a lot sooner had I not been screwed over by the bastards in this world.&nbsp; I reconsider this, as I've been known to be quite the bastard to myself, and spend the rest of the time in the shower thinking about  The Simpsons.   9:30 p.m. -&nbsp;Contemplate calling a couple of friends.&nbsp; Decide not to.&nbsp; I tell myself everyone's too busy, or asleep, or not expecting a call from me so I won't feel bad.   12:00 a.m. - Fall asleep either during  The Daily Show  or  Tough Crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sleep for the next six hours, start all over again.   Monotony rules!

      Nothing much changes.&nbsp; The more things change, the more they stay the same.&nbsp; Yada, yada, yada...&nbsp;   Six years ago, it was 1998.&nbsp; In the summer of that year, I:     lost a lot of weight (25-30lbs.)  began working at my first "real" job, in an office at one of the Big Three  was gearing up for a big move (the actual moving didn't happen until March of 1999, but divorce was imminent so I knew it was going to come)  was about to fall in love - hard - for the first time   Fast forward six years.&nbsp; It is now 2004, and this summer I've:   lost a lot of weight (no exact numbers, but everyone is telling me how great I look and everything is falling off of me)  been back at the same company now for the last year and a half  been preparing to move into my own place in the fall   Hmm, only one thing there that's missing.&nbsp; I think I'm okay with that, hell, it's been long enough, but yeah...  Kinda weird.

      This morning my mom called me with the news of my aunt's dog's passing.&nbsp; She was twelve, and my dearly departed cocker spaniel''s sister.&nbsp; She had a seizure after my aunt had gone to let her outside this morning.&nbsp; When my aunt went to check on her, she heard a few gasps and then she was gone.&nbsp; Now she and Spencer are running around in that big doggie heaven in the sky.&nbsp; Corny, I know, but I&nbsp;am certain&nbsp;that when I go he will be the first one to greet me, wherever we may be, floppy ears and all.  &nbsp;  We went to Mongolian BBQ for my co-worker's fifteenth anniversary with the company.&nbsp; It was delish (I got all veggies and had two spoonfuls of rice and no tortillas - go me!) and the boss surprised us by paying for all of our meals.&nbsp; I have the nicest and greatest boss in the world, totally laid back guy.&nbsp; Anyway, we all ended up splurging and having dessert.&nbsp; I split a Mocha Chip Ice Cream Pie with Terri, and it was so good that I am tacking on extra minutes to my workout tonight!&nbsp; I feel so guilty, but it  was  a special occasion. ;)  &nbsp;  Monday's over...&nbsp; My thoughts will be with my poor aunt as I&nbsp;walk into my room tonight and am greeted by the yawning and meows of my little cat.

      Ever read a piece of fiction that you can not stop thinking about?&nbsp; It's so brilliantly written you keep wondering, "why in the hell can't I write something like that?"?&nbsp; I experience this feeling&nbsp;any time I read anything (there goes that inferiority complex again), but in the latest issue of  urlLink Jane &nbsp;magazine there's an awesome story I urge you all to seek out.&nbsp; It's called&nbsp; Catalog.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sarcastic and&nbsp;unflinching, it really hits home with those of us who seem to think material things will bring us happiness.

       Ah, here it is.&nbsp; The end&nbsp;of another week in the days of our lives,&nbsp; and I leave you with this.&nbsp;    Ding, dong, the  urlLink bitch is gone !&nbsp; (At least for a little while.)  Here's a great  urlLink website  I got from  urlLink Miss Exena ; order yours now!  Currently Reading: I'm still in the throes of   urlLink Lennon: The Definitive Biography ,  by Ray Coleman, but am about to dive into  urlLink  Grosse Pointe Girl   ,  by Sarah Grace McCandless.&nbsp; A tale of suburbia in 1980's Michigan, it was a must for this Detroit girl.   Currently Listening To: Wilco's  A Ghost Is Born, &nbsp; Patti Smith's  Horses,  and Radiohead's  Hail To The Thief   Currently Watching:    urlLink  I Love The 90's   &nbsp;  Even though at times during this weeklong journey down memory lane I have gone between flinching at Hal Spark's lame masturbation jokes and wanting to throw my remote control at the horrors that are the Dancing Baby and the&nbsp;Snapple lady, I'm quite enjoying looking back at the trends, events, and entertainment that marked my high school&nbsp;years.  Currently Wishing For: More $$$, so I can buy  urlLink this  bedding set from  urlLink Target .&nbsp; I just spent $140 on new contacts for the next year, so unless I win the lotto (or, more realistically, stop blowing money on a bunch of shit) I'm S.O.L.    It's not much, but enjoy anyway and have a nice weekend.

      My Mom and I were in an elevator with glass walls. We were going up to someplace very high, when it stopped. Three men of Middle Eastern descent walked in, smiled, and pressed the button for the top floor of whatever building we were in. All three wore bright blue turbans, one had a t-shirt that clearly stated, "We warned you." My Mom "accidentally" nudged me, causing me to look out of the corner of my eye at the man next to me, who was licking a blade, nonchalantly.   I don't remember the last time I woke up from a dream so fucking scared.

      Today I found out, more than four months after the fact, that one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen,  urlLink Drake Sather ,  urlLink died . It was a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.  Words cannot describe the amount of sadness I am feeling over this.  When I was younger, about 12 or 13 years old, I would make it my main goal on weekends (long, often lonely weekends, seeing as how I was a) an only child, b) the only kid my age within a five block radius and c) the "quiet" girl in class) to stay up all night.  I would do this by watching videos, reading, writing little stories and, when all of that got tiresome (around 3:30-ish), I'd flick on the TV in the living room to  urlLink A&E  for the comedy shows.  There was  The Improv  and  Caroline's .  I'd try to stifle my laughing as I watched Drew Carey, Brett Butler, Brian Regan,  urlLink Margaret Cho , Jeanene Garafalo, and yes, Drake Sather, do their stuff.  Not to sound cheesy, but watching them somehow made me feel like I was  urlLink witnessing something great .  In a way, I was: many of the aforementioned comics turned into TV stars, while others blossomed into writers and actors reaching cult status.  Nowadays, to get my comics fix, there's always  urlLink Comedy Central , and  urlLink NBC's   urlLink Last Comic Standing  which I am highly, highly addicted to.  (And not just because  urlLink Gary Gulman  is such a cutie.) I do OK with all of that, but I find myself more often than not lately really missing those old stand-up shows.

      Construction has commenced on the eighth floor of the building I call home eight hours a day, five times a week.  I get a daily dose of what it must be like for others who suffer from migranes.  Splash a coat of paint on me and color me happy!  Speaking of work (which is what I really should be doing, given the fact that I'm sitting here, at work, at this very moment), the evil co-worker has gone home for the day (to do more painting, no doubt), but we did have a rare moment of co-worker bonding earlier today when faced with a problem our department has been going through for quite some time.  It was nice, but I won't let my guard down around her any time soon.  In "I am computer illiterate" news, I have my own  urlLink Blogroll  now, but no idea on God's green earth where in hell I have to paste it.  I know it has to go somewhere in the template code, but I've been playing with it all morning with nary a measure of success.

      That's right, folks and lovers of all things pop culture.   urlLink I Love The 90's  premires tonight on  urlLink VH1 .  Have your slap bracelets and flannel t-shirts at the ready, and settle in for five nights of a decade I swear ended only five years ago.    Too much, too soon?  You make the call.  I, for one, am looking forward to it.

      Short entry today, but it's only because I'm exhausted. I helped clean the house from top to bottom, washed my car, went to see Spiderman 2 - again -, got sucked into the "Buy 3, Get 1 Free" sale at Borders, and I'm beat.   There was yet another open house today.  In order to help Mom, I decided to start taking down things ("the clutter", according to the real estate agent) off of my walls.  If you've ever been inside of my room (wink-wink, nudge nudge) you'll remember how they were covered literally from ceiling to floor with posters, postcards, pictures I printed off the computer, Christmas lights, part of my  Gone With The Wind  plate collection, a drumstick...  You get the idea.  I took about 45% of the posters down, 100% of the postcards and the lights, and it looks, well... Empty.  A big empty place that, no matter what happens, I'll be vacating come fall.    It felt weird.  A good weird, but weird nonetheless. And you know me, good weird is where it's at. ;)

      I'm finally going to get my butt out to see this today.  I haven't decided yet whether or not to do the other stuff I wanted to do today first, or wait until afterwards.  I have a feeling if it affects me the way it has other people, I'd better do the other stuff first, as I don't want to be punching holes in the books at Borders or screaming about how fucked up this administration is to the guy at the car wash...  My Dad actually pleasantly surprised me yesterday when we were on the phone.  He's a huge movie buff, and we were talking about the summer movies when I asked, carefully (as I haven't really talked politics with him since the '92 election - when I was still too young to vote, mind you) if he's seen it yet.  He said, "No, but I want to."  I'd always figured him as more of a conservative, since back in '92 I was desperately trying to convince him to vote for Clinton instead of Perot (personally, I think Dad just really liked the way he talked), and in '96 tried to sway him away from Dole.  To be honest with you, I'm not even sure who he voted for in 2000, but after his statement yesterday of, "If I could shoot Bush and get away with it, I would." I have a feeling he's either a) seen the light or b) is smarter than I really give him credit for.  I didn't really ask, but since he's seeing it this weekend as well, I'll ask him when we next talk.

      The office is eerily quiet, as it's just me and the boss for the remainder of the day.  Evil co-worker had to go home and paint, and my other co-workers either had the day off, or were leaving at 1:00 anyway.  So, it's time for *drumroll* catch-all Friday!  I am currently:    reading  : A really engrossing John Lennon biography, or the "definitive", as the author makes it out to be. Clocking in at over 750 pages, I'd say so!    listening to:   Rock Your Punk Ass! 10, a great mix by a great friend. ;)   watching :   Reality Bites , on endless repeat.  Still thinking about that  Netflix  subscription, too...     thinking about :  how I'm going to make it through the next three hours, what in hell's name I'm going to do once I go home and for the rest of the weekend, and someone I should have stopped thinking about oh, a few years ago.  Dad called this morning to tell me that our old house was going up for sale.  I occasionally drive past it when I'm hit with pangs of nostalgia, so yeah, it was a bit weird to hear it's going to be on the market again.  Dad actually mentioned something about me buying it, but it would be way too expensive and besides, you never can go home again.    OK, time for me to get busy so the next few hours fly by...

      So last night I came home from work to find yet another late notice from  urlLink Columbia House  regarding some  Rockin' At The Movies  double CD set that I returned way the hell back in March.  At least they give you a service number to call after the third notice, so I dialed the number, and angrily waited for someone to answer.  My call was answered by Selo (pronounced CEE-lo). A very nice guy who, for taking the charge off my account offered to propel me into the Preferred Account Status Membership, where I would only have to call them or go online when I wanted to order from them, therefore receiving less mailings and so on and so forth.  I said, "If you take those cds off of my account, I don't care what the hell you do."  He took  Rockin' At The Movies  off, told me again how I was Preferred, then we said our goodbyes.  This morning I go to check my account status.  The cds have been taken off (yay!), but being Preferred comes at a cost (boo!).  I have to order one cd every three months in order to fulfill that agreement (what agreement?  Selo, are you listening to this?).  I'm going to call Selo, or whoever, again tonight.  I want a divorce from Columbia House.  Damned dirty music clubs.

      I hate worrying about money.  With a trip to New York and moving coming up in a few months, it seems it's all I've been thinking about lately.  Now with  urlLink this  little bit of news this morning, money is practically controlling every part of my brain.  Add on to all of that a plan to see my friend in Tennessee sometime this year and it looks as if I'll be broke from now till Timbuktu.  I spent a good deal of money this weekend on clothes and going out, so leave it to my warped little mind to feel guilty about that, even though I really needed some new clothes and a couple of fun nights out.  God, what is wrong with me?  It's Tuesday morning, it feels like a Monday, and already my evil co-worker has taken a stab at me.  Every time I hit the stapler I imagine her face in between the sheets of paper and metal...  Is that so wrong?  Despite all of my bitching, I really am in a decent mood this morning. Really.

      Seriously. I was doing three other things ten minutes ago.  The weekend is shaping up to be a long, leisurely one, spiked with equal parts shopping and hanging out with friends.  Last night, however, I spent some time with the hilarious  urlLink Dane Cook .  OK, it was through watching the Comedy Central special of his, but still, it was good times.  I went to his website today and found out he's playing  urlLink Caroline's  the very weekend I get into New York.  Which means, I am so there.  After watching a few more of those stand-up specials, I flipped over to the local news, which was broadcasting the winning lotto numbers from the  urlLink Big Game , that as of last night was a whopping $280 million dollars.  Turns out some lucky bastard (who isn't me) won it.   Fast forward onto today.  I worked out, got my eyebrows arched, then went on a major shopping spree with Mom.  I got a black skirt, a dress, a pair of linen pants that don't look as old grannyish as they might sound, and a pink striped shirt, perfect for pairing with either the black skirt or the linen pants.  Mission accomplished?  Not quite. I still need a pair of good-fitting jeans. Despite that, it was a good shopping trip.   Tonight I'm going to dinner with a friend for her birthday, then I'm going to catch Spiderman 2.  Sunday will be busy; we have more showings for the house, then I'm spending the day with Briget.  Monday I'm going to check out the new, improved,  urlLink Greenfield Village    with my Mom.  Last time I went was about ten years ago, so it'll be interesting to see how it's changed.  That's about it from me.  Have a Happy Fourth!

      Does anyone remember that show?  Anyway...  The daisies are now completely dead.  My plan to have a vaseful of pretty flowers at my work desk has failed miserably. Oh, well. Onto bigger and better things...  I wore my standard weekend outfit into work today: my favorite pair of jeans (that are now waaay too loose on me) and a baby blue Old Navy t-shirt.  Since it is my usual bumming around/errand running ensemble, I feel like I shouldn't even be here, typing away, and that I should be in some crazy ass long line at the grocery store or Rite Aid instead.  Today was one of those mornings where you can't find any reason why any of the clothes in your closet should be there, you hate everything and resolve to go out and bring home a brand new wardrobe a.s.a.p.    I need new jeans.  I need new shirts.  Maybe a new dress, too.  I don't know why any of this is even making it into one of my entries but, whatever, it is.

      - I love writing, but more and more lately I feel as if the time to do it as a suitable hobby/side "job" is slipping away faster than I realize.    - I'm totally enamored with my cat, which is why no one else can get close to her without facing dire consequences. OK, so make that three reasons I really shouldn't have children.    - I am ridiculously naive when it comes to matters of love.  I want too much, expect too much, and long for the perfection that most human beings can only dream of achieving (myself included).  I have closed myself off to anything  real  since my last relationship disintegrated over three years ago, preferring the comfort of impossible crushes on men who are completely wrong for me.   - I am wondering if becoming a   urlLink Netflix   member will make me seem lazier than I really am.  - The daisies on my desk here at work are dying, proving the point that I am useless with plants.    - I feel that this year has been a success so far, in terms of my really thinking about what I want, and things that matter the most to me.    - I'm realizing that there are things that  do  matter to me.  (I wrote somewhere before that one of my problems was that a lot of stuff didn't.)  - Music will always be the one constant in my life.  That, and my mother's love.   The End.

      Oh, how I loathe playing it.  The sushi was delish; now I'm counting down the minutes until I can go home and do some kickboxing to work it all off.   This has been April's mid-afternoon random thoughts.  She needs another coffee to think coherently for the rest of the day.

      - God bless the team at  urlLink Interference.com , for providing all of us U2 addicts with the latest and greatest news that our favorite band's  urlLink new single  is going to drop Sept. 24th, with the much-anticipated album following a month later. Hallejulah!  - I'm jonesing for some California Rolls in  the  worst way. Luckily, the grocery store right by us has a sushi chef, so I will be stopping in during my lunch hour to get some. Yesterday I was good at lunch, having hummus and fruit salad, but then last night I had three martinis and split a cheese and crackers spread at the bar. Today will be a good opportunity to make up for yesterday's snafus.  - I'm going to the  urlLink Woodward Dream Cruise  Saturday. I've never been, so this will make for a (hopefully) interesting time. Old men with revved up engines. Don't even ask me to go there with an inappropriately placed Viagra joke.

      Kidding! OK, well in some parts of the ship more than others it certainly was. My evil co-worker seems so much less so when in the company of her new beau (she's two years widowed so it was nice to see her so happy), and a girl I hardly know from the third floor was obviously a smitten kitten with her date, whom she met through the singles group about a month or two ago.  I got there just in the nick of time, before 7:30, which was when we were scheduled to board. There were over 100 people there, mostly in their late forties and beyond (like, way beyond). I met up with my friends and for the first half-hour or so we sat around and talked, looked at pictures of my co-worker's new dog, Lucky, and made many trips to the bar. Things were going well; I said hi to the young engineer guy who had come to the office for the tickets, and later when I saw him on my way downstairs I smiled and he was very sweet and smiled back. That was the last time I had fun or saw anyone for an hour, because shortly after I came downstairs, I got seasick!  I haven't been on a boat in almost three, maybe four, years, and have never to my recollection gotten seasick before. I spent almost an hour pushing my way through the bathroom line to go toss my cookies (and three Jack and Cokes). It was not the way I imagined this cruise would be going at that point in the evening, but oh well. Just as we were passing by the MGM Casino (we went all along the Detroit river) I was sitting in a corner, gulping on water and my friends were coming up asking if I felt alright. I was so embarrassed, and bummed to boot.  When the queasiness seemed to have subsided, I decided to get some fresh air. I went out on the deck, situated myself on a seat in the corner, and instantly felt better. The cool air and the calming waves were just what the doctor ordered. I should have gone out there in the first place! Anyway, it wasn't long before young engineer guy's friends came up and began talking to me. They were both very nice, but before long, one parted company so I ended up talking to the other one for the rest of the night. He's 30 (did some quick math when he told me how old he was when Elvis died - yeah, a bit strange that that came up, but I'm weird so what can I say?), wears cute glasses, and drives a Mercedes (this I got from my friends, who parked next to them). At the end of the night he asked for my number, and I gave it to him. He was very nice, so we'll see. I just keep picturing Vince Vaughn in  Swingers , tearing up the redheaded actress's phone number after talking to her for an hour... Terrible, I know, but I have that cynical gene implanted in me.  On a lighter note, it did turn out to be a fun night (with the exception of my illness), and I'm glad I went.

          They seem to have totally passed us by, as usual.  (Just check out  urlLink Miss Weather Pixie  for proof.)  I cannot wait for fall.  Crisp air, falling leaves, apple orchards and Halloween.  Every year I know this is the exact reason I could never migrate down South:  I love autumn and all of it's perks too much.  I'll write about the cruise tomorrow.  For now, I've got to get going on re-listing some things on  urlLink e-Bay .

       urlLink This  isn't helping my shopping addiction. Not in the slightest. I love how when I first get it, I'm made to feel poor, inadequate, and morbidly obese before I'm even done flipping through the table of contents. By the next day, however, I'm mapping out shopping strategies for the weekend and if I come home with a few new items, I instantly feel better. All of this would be okay if it weren't for the fact that I mainly just dress up for work: I'm totally a jeans and a t-shirt kinda girl at heart, which basically means I don't need half of all of those hoity toity fashion items I crave. Bummer.  Tonight I spent forty-five minutes figuring out what I'm going to wear tomorrow on my trip to Target and pre-NYC shopping at the mall (ugh), and the much dreaded cruise tomorrow night (classic black  urlLink CBGB's  tee, skinny jeans - which fit better each time I wear them, yay! - and white  urlLink Candie's  looking slides for the shopping, pink chiffony top and flirty black skirt that skims my knees plus my sexy black kitten heel sandals for the cruise). Forty-five minutes. I could have done twenty other better things with my time, like:    Read a few chapters of   urlLink The Order Of The Phoenix   (that I just got - no spoilers, please!)  Watched a bit of  urlLink  The Ref   DVD that Genny lent me today (she shares my weird attraction to  urlLink Denis Leary )  Caught up on blogs  Played catch the mouse with Mia  Start organizing my things downstairs  Had a panic attack over the cruise   On the bright side, I was productive in other ways tonight. I listed more of my things on e-Bay, did some laundry, and worked out after I got back from my eyebrow wax. Not too shabby (and, after 6:00 p.m. tonight, neither are my eyebrows, haha).

      Today I decided to treat myself and go get a mani/pedi at lunchtime. I was walking through the  urlLink Lord & Taylor  that's ajacent to the mall when I spotted an entire rack full of L.A.M.B. bags. I was like Cookie Monster in a Mrs. Fields - I was salivating at all of the new styles and immediately wanted to forgo the pampering for an hour of trying on Hella Hobos and Girlfriend bags. I was reaching for a fetching Hella in the black logo when I suddenly remembered my old Girlfriend bag and the fact that just a couple of days ago I returned it to LeSportsac for repairs. I remembered in the e-mail they had sent me that if there was no way a repair could be made they'd give me a discount towards my next purchase. Still salivating with the possibility of a discount on my next L.A.M.B, I charged on ahead to the nail place.  After returning to work with light lilac fingers and toes, I opened up my e-mail to find one from who else but LeSportsac!   Dear April:  We received your damaged bag and unfortunately, it cannot be mended nor replaced since this particular bag has sold our and is no longer available.  We would like to offer you a bag of the same value, or you may receive a store credit to use toward your next purchase.     Hmm... I will never see my beloved Girlfriend bag ever again *sniff*, but this means if I want, I can get a NEW L.A.M.B. bag! Woohoo!  Edit to add:  If you notice, the e-mail said they'd give me a credit, not just a discount.  I spoke to the rep on the phone tonight, she said that there would be some cute, new L.A.M.B.'s debuting the  first week of October  (if you're listening, Char, lol) and that I could use my credit for up to two years.  I heart LeSportsac.

      I am in love with  urlLink this  movie. I first saw it when I was sixteen years old, on Thanksgiving morning 1994. I made sure to get up early (9:00 a.m. back then was early for me on a non-school day) so I could pop the video in the VCR and record it. Earlier in the week my Mom had told me it was going to be on, so we had to go up to the Perry's by our house so she could buy me a blank tape. When the time finally came I was ready, and sat entranced by it for the next four and a half hours. Years later when I had the chance to see it on the big screen, I became very emotional as the title swept across the screen in those bold letters.  The movie was not my first exposure to Scarlett, Rhett, the war and Mammy. I had come down with a nasty case of bronchitis the month before and had to stay home from school for two weeks. My then best friend Cindy had lent me her copy of the book, which I promptly devoured. It took me almost a month and a half to finish, in between doctor's visits and making up loads of schoolwork, but the night I turned the last page, tears in my eyes, I knew it had all been worth it. I was cured of the bronchitis, but now had an incurable case of Scarlett Fever.  Scarlett was my hero (some would say, she still is). She was not classically beautiful, according to the book, but she had passion, a strong will, and determination to make whatever she needed to have happen happen. She was often stupid, making choices that would hurt those around her but serve her well. She could be arrogant, nasty, and harsh. But she could also come through for those she loved in times of need, and be realistic and dependable when the situation called for it. I like to think that I have some or all of those qualities, more so the good vs the bad. I know I have far too often held those bad qualities in high regard, but I'm not exactly sure if I'm sorry for it. As Rhett would say (when Scarlett is sobbing that if her mother were to see her how ashamed she'd be), "You're like the thief who isn't the least bit sorry he stole, but is terribly, terribly sorry he's going to jail."  Like Scarlett, I too have had my share of Ashley Wilkes in my life. They seem to be perfect, but often it's a perfection dreamed up in my own head, destined to come crashing down all around me after it's too late. I have yet to find my Rhett - or, maybe I did find him but, like Scarlett, pushed him away to where he just didn't "give a damn" anymore. Sadly, the tears I cried when I first read the ending of the book all those years ago have turned all too real when life finally came knocking and I had my own first love and heartaches to deal with.  I love this book. I love the movie even more. The dresses, Vivien Leigh's stunning beauty, the Southern accents, hell, I even love the running time of just under five hours! What I love the most is how vivid the characters are, how they seem to jump off of the screen at you. How you can easily imagine the people you are surrounded by everyday as your very own Sue Ellen, Mammy (politically incorrect to say, I know, but I mean as more of a "loving, nurturing but not afraid to kick your ass when it needs it" personality), or Gerald O'Hara, with his pride and love of his land.  I have collected the memorabilia since I was sixteen. Unfortunately, most all of it is in boxes downstairs, waiting to be moved into an apartment in the fall when it hopes that I'll have enough room to display it again. I have plates, books, ornaments, dolls, bell jars, playing cards, etc. If you can name it, I probably have it. Heaven forbid I ever become destitute - I still wouldn't sell the collection I searched, went broke for, and worked so hard to build.  I love this movie. It's only been since Christmastime when I last saw it, but I'm feeling the itch again. I'm sure this weekend, or maybe over Labor Day weekend I'll settle down with the DVD, and become wrapped up in the greatest love story of the movies. I'll think about when I'll watch it next tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day. ;)  (Come on, you  knew  I'd throw that one in!)

      A couple of my co-workers are involved in a singles group that's sponsored by our company, and they are having a cruise on Saturday. Today they both came to my desk to tell me that three twenty-six year old guys were going to swing by around 4:00 p.m. to pick up their tickets for said cruise, and that there were only a handful left and that "you just HAVE to come!".  OK, I am not a hugely social person by nature. I like my friends, going out and all of that normal stuff, but this mingling and meeting new people - especially guys - can be such a pain and utter bullcrap to me. Sometimes it's alright, but about 75% of the time it ends up being a disappointing experience. I hate the stiffness and forced politeness of situations like these, but hey - there's going to be alcohol so maybe it'll be less awkward than usual. After almost being beaten down by my two girls on the third floor, I decided to throw caution to the wind. I'm going.  I'm sure you're thinking, "Sounds fun, a night on a boat with a bunch of drunk, single people", and you may be right and I could end up having the time of my life. On the other hand, I have such a hard time giving myself an easy time that this may not be possible. I never could see why anyone would give me a compliment, unless they wanted something or were doing it to be nice. Even when my Mom or friends tell me nice things, I'm wary. I need to take a course in self-esteem, that much should be obvious by now.  I try to relax, but sometimes I get super self-conscious and can't for the life of me. I don't know why I get so weird, but I'm trying to get better. Ugh...  So, I'm going on a cruise. I'm sure it'll be fun, and that all of my worrying is (as usual) for naught. But when you've lived so long inside of a head like mine, you get used to it all.

          Good News Alert #1: The call with the Apartment Lady went great! I am now officially on the waiting list to move in mid-October.  Pfft, I don't know why I was so nervous... Good News Alert #2:  I got my Kerry Edwards bumper stickers and my Kerry For Women dog tag tonight when I came home. Yippee! I feel  Oh So Political , dont'cha know.   Just got back from a long walk. I hope to lose a little bit more weight before New York so we'll see how that goes. Had guacamole burgers for dinner tonight with fresh corn on the cob and cottage cheese. I can eat my weight and then some in guaca, so I can safely pat myself on the back for staying so restrained while I was spooning the green stuff on.  I walked at seven, meaning I missed my new favorite show,  urlLink 360 With Anderson Cooper . Who else here remembers him as the annoying skinny dude from Channel One? Now that he's 37, gray, and hosting his own show on  urlLink CNN , he's pretty hot. Smart guys = major mojo.   Before I leave you for tonight, dearest blog, here is a picture of my new sticker on the back of my car:

      I have to wait until 11:00 a.m. to call the woman from the apartments back to see about my application. I don't know why, it should be OK, but I'm nervous. Wish me luck... I just hate feeling so lame about something that people do every day, just because it's me and I've never done it and blah blah blah. Tell me it'll be fine, and that one day I will grow the hell up already.  The weekend was okay. I hit the annual street fair on Saturday morning with Mom, then went shopping and returned home with - NOTHING! I'm losing my touch, I swear. Actually, the shirt I wanted at Hot Topic (oh, my gawth!) they had, but it was only in a size that was a smidge too big on me. They ordered the right size for me from another store, and I'll get it later this week, along with some shoes I saw when I was there with Emily last week. I called Brig for her birthday, and we'll be getting together later this week to celebrate, since she had to work all weekend. Yesterday I did some grocery shopping and made some yummy cran-orange muffins to bring into work today. That was about it, nothing too earth-shattering.  T.B.I.M... (Too Bad It's Monday)

      That's how I've been feeling the past two days, which is why I haven't really written in here. I try to at least once a day, but sometimes you just come up empty.  We had our garage sale yesterday and today, and for the last few hours today I helped out. We did pretty well, and the rest of my stuff that didn't sell I've decided I'm going to hawk on e-Bay. Any tips out there from the pros I should know about? I've only bought there for my five plus years of being a member, but I'm a virgin when it comes to selling.  I still have yet to get to my workout today, and then later I have to go return my L.A.M.B. bag for repairs and do a bunch of other boring errands (one of which is to stock up on my Vanilla Stoli for the weekend). After that, who knows...  T.G.I.F! Maybe I'll be more insightful tomorrow... Or I'll just sleep in.

      Like shopping. And the internet. And the new  urlLink Lite Frappucinos  from  urlLink Starbucks . I finally got to try one yesterday at the mall and it was so yum! I got mine without whipped cream, saving me about 150 calories and 8 or more grams of fat. I'm being so good, and it's showing more every day. Last night Emily and I ended up hanging around the mall for the entire night (the movie ended up being too late for both of us, since we had to be up early today) and I found the cutest black and white dress on clearance for $19 that fit like a glove. I feel so girly in it (trust me, I live in jeans and t-shirts when I can). She kept telling me that I looked like so thin, causing me to get really embarrassed, almost to a point where I didn't believe it. I know, I have zero self-esteem and can never believe it when anyone gives me a compliment. But, anyway...  It's raining like a motherfucker right now, and all I have to keep me company is the radio, a fan, and a few cute construction workers who pass by my desk every once in a while.

      Sunday night as Mom and I were driving home from the rally (Dad punked out - it's a long, stupid story I won't bother to go into) I went to close my  urlLink L.A.M.B  handbag when the zipper came clean off. I was (understandably) pissed, and yesterday wrote  urlLink LeSportsac's  Customer Service department. Amazingly enough, I got a prompt response telling me to send back the purse to their repair department, where they'll attempt to fix it. Converse Customer Service could stand to learn a thing or two from them.  It's looking as if it's going to be a good day. So far work hasn't been too bad (not too busy, but steady), and in an hour Michelle and I are going to head to the mall for lunch to pick up a few things. Then we're going to have sushi... Mmmm, sushi.  My little sis Emily is in town from NJ this week, and after I get off work we're going to meet up for dinner then go see  urlLink The Village . I think I may spontaneously combust at  urlLink Joaquin Phoenix  and  urlLink Adrien Brody's  being in the same movie, so if I don't post tomorrow, you'll know what happened.

      It was a very exciting atmosphere, with all of the usual suspects on hand: protesters, little kids with flags painted on their faces, volunteers holding clipboards with petitions to sign. We got into the park a little after five, and then it was a "hurry up and wait" type deal after that. There was a barbecue, and a band playing in between a dj spinning everyone from The Beach Boys to John Mellencamp.  It was close to sunset when we saw the ABC News bus pull into the lot, and about halfway through one of the speeches from one of the local politicians that had gathered onto the playing field we spotted the Kerry/Edwards bus coming around the back entrance of the park. I jumped off from my spot in the bleachers (which, since the bus was coming from the back, began teetering as people turned to get a good look) and walked towards the barricades that were up by the side of the road where the bus was going to pass through. I had my camera ready as the bus rolled in, and began clicking away when Senator Kerry opened up the window and waved to us all in the crowd . The only decent picture I took turned out a little blurry, but still, it was such a thrill to see the potential next President of the United States that up close.  Of course, as it has many times of late, U2's "Beautiful Day" played as he entered and greeted his fellow Democrats and worked his way through the small crowd on the field. The spot we had found in the bleachers was the "secret spot" as one volunteer put it, and it turned out to be the case, with the bus driving right by us and the spot where he was to give his speech not that far away either.  The speech was mostly culled from the one he gave last Thursday, this time focusing more on jobs, health care, and Iraq than anything else- issues very close to the people who had turned out to see him. He translated much better from the TV screen than I thought he would. It sounds funny, but he seemed more "human", and not at all stiff or aloof as others have painted him. There was an exchange between him and young girl who was part of a group of kids brought out to recite the Pledge of Allegiance that was very cute, and a joke about how alike he and John Edwards really are ("Both of our names are John, we both have two beautiful daughters, he was named  People  magazine's Sexiest politician - I read  People  magazine..."). In person he cuts a strong, striking figure, and is very distinguished and handsome - it occurred to me how in a strange way he looks younger than the President we have now, when the startling fact is Bush is just three years younger. Of course, that may have something to do with the old saying that we want our Presidents to look as if they've been through the wringer after their tour of duty in the White House, but I like to think different. ;)  I felt proud being there last night. I felt proud of our country's ability and willingness to "do better" as I listened to him speak on all the issues and heard the crowd cheer its approval. I found myself walking out not being able to wait for November 2nd so I could go and do what is my right as an American citizen and vote. I urge every one who is reading this to take the time to vote and make yourself heard. I am going to spread the word and make sure that all of the people who sat home in 2000 get angry enough , and that it makes them put on their coats, get in their cars, and drive to their nearest church, hall, or school to cast their vote.  Vote on November 2nd. If you aren't registered,  urlLink here's  where you need to go. Please vote;  everything  is counting on it.
