      We went to Harold Park today, to feed the ducks some bread that we had left over. Me, Mum, Troy, Debbie and Brandon. So...we got there, and there was this dog with a ball, she went to Debbie, and dropped the ball at her feet, so Debbie threw it for her, and she caught it and came back, so I had a go. We found out that the dog was called Misty, I loved that dog, she was so cute!  Misty's owner had another dog called Burny, he was cute too, and then their owner threw Misty's ball in the lake, and Misty swam after it, but then dropped it when she was near the edge, so I had to get myself wet and get it back for her.  But then, Troy got attacked on the way out of the park by a large Alsation. He went for Troy's neck! And at first, the owner did nothing, and Mum had to pick Troy up to get him out of the way. That was just...horrible.  Hopefully, tomorrow won't end like that.

      Well, I don't know if I WANT to keep the pixies away, but last night, around 9pm, I started cleaning my bedroom for the hell of it. I still can't believe it. I usually only tidy my bedroom on command of my parents, but this time, I started it alone, and it only took me one hour to get around half of it done. By ten, I was in my nice neat bed, watching Big Brother. (which I was laughing my head off at. Michelle is getting all possessive over Stu, because he is now attached at the waist to Shell. What fun!)  There is one person in this world, who I wish I was attached at the waist to. I think it would be quite fun, as a school project, for girls to be attached to boys, according to their weight. Knowing my luck, I would be attached to Umar (as he is really light); but it would make us all socialise more, and it would be pretty fun to see who cracked first. Of course, it wouldn't be possible, because of different subject and sets and all that, bu oh well...I think it would be funny.  What am I doing today? Probably tidying my bedroom more. Goodbye, or as Sara says, Ciao.

      Hey...me again, this is only gonna be short. Mum and Jess went to orthodontists, and I went round to Debbies, to babysit Brandon. He was cute today...you know what he did? He climbed up on the coffee table, and was sat on it! God...he's only 11 months old, just learnt to walk, we were so surprised, thing was, if he'd have fallen backwards, he would have hurt himself badly.  So, Debbie left, and Brandon immediately started up (because he missed and wanted his mum); but I finally got him to settle down, and he was just falling asleep on me, when his dad, Gavin came home, and woke him up again, so...a good day all round ^^;  Oh yeah! -dies- Okay, so I don't usually die, but...this boy who me and Jess used to be mortal enemies with is back on the street...only for a little while, but we hate him, so we won't be answering the door to him...hehe.

      I hate having dreams. I had this really weird one last night. It started with me, Jessica and my mum on a bus going to...Halifax I think it was. Sitting next to me and Jess was one of our old teachers, and we wanted to get her phone number, but for some reason, we couldn't. We almost crashed on the bus, but instead of going on the road, it started going on the edge, near the river, almost in it. Finally, we stopped, and me and Jess were separated from my mum, and we went to this big shopping centre, and there was an escalator. What was weird was that it sort of...ended, at the end, with nowhere to go, and we had to jump off just before it ended so that we could go down in the lift to get back down to the bottom. It took us so many times to get it right. o__O; Then...something happened, and I tried to get Jess to find mum with me, but she wouldn't, and a lot of things happened, and Mary Kate and Ashley were in my dream (yes...weird, I know.); and then it ended, with a statue of George Bush (his hands in a peace sign, ya know...first finger and little finger up, others down); being burned down by a riot of people.  Weird, I know.  Anyway, yesterday, SOMEONE phoned (and I am not writing who, because my mum and Jess want to know, and I ain't telling them, they should keep their noses out of my business -grins- Maaaaaybe, I'll tell 'em later.); anyway, other than that, we went to the park yesterday with Troy, my dog, as well as going to get mine and Jess' half fare passes. The picture on this site, is actually the one I used for my half fare pass.  I am babysitting Brandon today, round about 4; whilst mum and Jess are going to the orthodontist, to get Jessica's bottom brace fitted. Apparently (according to Jess, who told Mum), they said it was her last chance, I wonder if her brushing has improved?

      Right, well, Marc had one of these, so I decided to make one as well. I have read all of his posts, and I must say, I am quite intrigued by them, so I will begin this post by introducing myself, what I like, etc.  My name is Kimberley Louise Wilson, and I am 15 years old. I live in the UK and I love to roleplay, write fiction, read and design web pages. I have a sister called Jessica, and five cats and a dog, Troy.  I have to mention my friends on this site, my best friends would be Wajeeha, Marc, Aksa, Priya, Ashleigh, Sheridan, Natasha, Matthew and Tom.  I also have best friends on the internet, ^^; those would be Soph, Vicki, Leigh, Ems and Darian.  And that is my first post, my second one will come quite soon after this one, telling you of my day today.

      Well...today, as usual, I got up and went on the computer (One of the first things I do in the morning, is switch it on); I was up at 9:30; and by 10, I was on MSN, because I realised that one of my internet friends, Soph, would be online (she has a new rota of the net, 10-12, 2-4, and 6-8; I said she'd never keep it XD). Anyway, Sara was also online, and it seemed she had written a new chapter of her fiction, so I read that. (I must just compliment Sara on her writing ability, it is very, very good).  So, anyway, I went onto Avidgamers (www.avidgamers.com) and then onto my site. (www.avidgamers.com/WOTE); which is a roleplaying site, after answering the many posts on there (wasn't actually that many...I replied to most of them last night), I then went onto the other sites I had joined.  And then, my mother asked me who Marc wants to ask out, and I said, I don't know, why? She said that he had said something about it in his blog (I do actually know who he wants to ask out, but let's not go into that, I have already advised him against it). So I went and saw his blog, and decided to make one of my own.  Now, I ask this question. Who the hell is Flip? Weird...never heard Marc talk about anyone like that before, oh well...and I thought it was he and I who have 2 hour conversations? It's not my fault that I don't sign onto MSN that much, or only do so to talk to the people who are on my sites, about that sort of stuff. Anyway, enough about that. Today I have to go to the post office to get my half fare pass, and will be going soon. I might post here later on.  Bye.

      It's been really weird the past few days, has it not? Sunny in the morning, and then cooler, and sometimes even wet, in the afternoons? I love it when it's hot though...  I have to start my homework, but I can't be bothered yet. -makes a mental note- I have to do some RE coursework, Geography homework, and Maths coursework. Stupid homework.  This week, I shouldn't be online that much, because I should be going out a lot, because my dad is off work for a week...On Monday, I MIGHT be going to Flamingo Land, on Tuesday, I have my orthodontists, (stupid braces) and that's only how far we've got...should be going somewhere on Friday as well.  Nowt else to say really...I don't think they'll read this but happy birthday to Matthew and Thomas Mann ^^;

      Wow...I haven't updated this in a while. Two days ago, I went to Southport Beach, and Formy Point Squirrel Park, (where Wayne Rooney's girlfriend chucked her 25K ring...as you can imagine, there were a lot of people there.); The squirrels were fun, one even came up and ate out of my hand (my mum recorded it, if anyone wants to see it); and then we went to the beach. I found this gorgeous shell, and picked it up to take it home, but then I screamed, and threw it to the floor. For in there, there was a large hermit crab. Anyway, I wanted the shell, so we took the crab out, and mum called me cruel, but I said it was a thief anyway, right? But mum still said I was cruel, so we made it another makeshift house -grin- using some other smaller shells I had found.  Then we ran into the sea (mum made another video) and then dried our feet and headed back. Southport was quite good too, there was this really cool hall of mirrors. That was really fun!
