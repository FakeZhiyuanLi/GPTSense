      I went home for lunch just now. Well.. even a short nap can make me dream..hahaha Anyway, I don't quite remember what the dream was about. But I'm very sure that I dream about something. What I remembered was, I heard my mom keep calling my name many times. I don't remember why she called.

      Let me start this blog with my dream last night. Usually I tend to dream about something that is connected to what I did or think before going to bed. Well.. last night I watch '50 First Dates'[Drew Barrymore & Adam Sandler]. Don't get me wrong. I didn't dream about them. But this is what I dream of:-  I dreamt that my collegue, Azhar give me a phone call at 11am asking weather I'll be coming to work or not since I was already 2 hours late. I was still in bed at that time. I told him that I had a short term memory lost and I don't remember where is my office and what time should I be going to the office.  The moral of the story.. don't watch any movie before heading to the bed..Hahahaha

      I've created a new blog. This blog will include my everyday dream...hehehe. I've realize that somehow.. I have dreams every night or everytime I sleep. So, i think I should keep it as a journal just for me to keep track on my dreams and remembering it..hehehe. Who knows.. there might be something worth about it. Anyway.. I like analyzing my own dreams..hehehe :P

      Sometimes, even without the snooze button I manage to get few dreams in a row. This are my dream last night. It was just some short scene..Hahaha I'm not quite sure the actual order.   Scene 1: Yesterday, I log in into my ntv7 forum as usual and I read about this two people were planning to meet up at YowChuan for Karaoke. In my dream, I actually was there, at YowChuan and saw both of them were sitting on a table drinking together. I did'nt talk to them and introduce myself though!  Scene 2: I dream that I was at McDonalds having lunch or dinner wth my lil brother(Azhad) and my uncle(pakcik). This mcDonals is different. It wasn't self-service, they serve us at our table. I was about to give my order but my uncle ask me first weather will he be kenyang just by taking chicken. How big is the chicken? I instead said that he'll definitely kenyang because the chicken is big. It's quater of one whole chicken. I wonder since when McD serve those kind of big chicken..hahaha  Scene 3: Yesterday I ran into my old schoolmate(Haidi). We said 'hi'! He also said we should have lunch together sometimes. So, I said Insyallah. Anyway.. somehow.. he came into my next dream. In my dream, it was already the day after. I was going to have my lunch downstairs at the restaurant. I saw him as if waiting for me to have lunch together. But instead of me siiting with him, I sat next to somebody else. I don't remember who he was. But I definitely knew him from somewhere. Haidi instead, just sit there alone.  Scene 4: This is a very short dream. I was talking to nonie. I think it was on the phone because I don't somehow saw her face. She was asking me about her b'day. How about celebrating it at her new home. I don't agree since I'm not allowed to go out at night time. Instead I suggest to crash the party in my house, in my room. She finally agreed...Hahaha  Scene 5: I dream that I was at the office and my collegue told me to help him up to photocopy some documents.   Don't Believe everything that appear in your dream..

      I've just remembered anoter one of my dream last night.  I dreamt that I was in my formner high school. I was on y was to the old surau to pray. I don't know what fardhu was it. Anyway, I was walking towards the surau, wearing 'terompah' and only kain batik. Nobody seems to feel it was awkward. As I entered the surau, I saw that there was no curtain to seperate the men section and ladies. But everyone was praying with no problem. So, i go on wearing my telekung and pray. After finishing praying I saw 2 men that seems familiar was praying in front of me. It was 2 of my friend that i met in Mecca when I went there few months ago. One of it is Ustaz Zul. He turn to me and smile..hahaha  What is he doing in my dream?? How come I've never dream my boyfrend praying eh??

      Last night, I'm very sure that I have 3 dreams in a row. However I only manage to remember 1 of it.  In my dream, I was taking a ride on a car with my mom's friend (Unty Julia). We were like going somewhere where we'll be passing by a toll booth. In her hands was lots of coins. Enough for the toll amount. But she insist to the coins for bigger change. So she dive me home only for me to change the whole coins into dollars from my mother.  The funny thing about this dream was, I hardly knew Unty Julia. Inact I've never had any kind of ride on her car. And I didn't even remember when was the last time I even talk to her. I wonder how did she manage to enter my dream???? hahaha..

      I have an alarm clock with a snooze button. I love to press it every morning. I once use the snooze button form 7am to 9am.. Hahaha Each time I snap the snooze button I'll get a different dream slot! Last night.. from what I remembered I had so many dream slot. But I don't remember all of it.  Slot 1: I dreamt I was in my office alone. Then my boss was at the door. I opened the door only to find out that he looks very different that day. That's because he had coloured his hair completely in WHITE. I was shocked and ask him why did he colored it white, he says.. it's a new trend. I was puzzeled! Then when I looked out the window, I saw my collegue (Azhar) downstairs talking to somebody. And what surprised me was, everyone have white hair colour including Azhar. Then I thought, my boos was really up to date in hair fashion. Then I heard somebody was at the door. When I opened it I saw Azhar. But he has no white hair. He looks as usual with his bald head..hahaha. When I looked out the window, I realized that it was somebody else and I say to myself, how can I mistaken that guy downstairs for being Azhar. Azhar is bald!!!  Slot 2: I dreamt I was in a middle of a road nowhere I remembered. Then I saw one man whom I knew but I can't remember who he was. Anyway, that guy was asking me to lend him some money. Few thousands I think! And the reason was because he needs to start a business of selling ice-cream..hahaha

      Last night.. I went out with my friends. We were talking about how damage Nonie's hair was since there's too much chemical on it. Pluss she's been colouring her hair over and over again. Now she's been thinking to use henna instead of hair dye. Well.. this is what I dreamt about last night..  I dreamt that.. all of my friends were lepaking in my room. We were trying to make the henna experiment on my hair. Since Nonie said the henna won't stick on her hair, we decided to try on my hair instead. I bleach my hair first.. then when I put on the henna.. it works. The color does stick..hahaha And my hair was brown..hahaha

None of the people there I hardly know except.. I remember&nbsp;I saw Zaed, my ex-schoolmate. He was wearing baju melayu full suite. He came with a lady. A pretty women! He says hi to me and I was puzzeled! &nbsp; The thing is... what the hell is Zaed doing in my dream??? Arggghhh..

      Last night dream, I definitely lost it. Completely forgot! Maybe I didn't even had any dream last night. But however yesterday night I had the best dream ever. I finally dreamt about my dearest sweety. &nbsp; The scene was taken at my late grandfather's home in Kelantan. I was sitting on the&nbsp; veranda in the arms of my dearest. What strange about the situation was,&nbsp;I saw few of Fajar's friend in the house watching TV and some of them were walking around the house. I ask Fajar what are they doing here and Fajar said.. it's none of our business and it's not important.

      Last night I had few dreams. Don't remember all of it though. Anyway..&nbsp;I remembered dreaming about Nonie. She call me up mumbling about Kassim's disturbing behaviour. She told me she's very angry with that fella. Then she came over my house and consulted her problem with my mom.. Hahaha now that's the funny part. Meanwhile I just sit by them just listening as if I'm not allowed to interrupt the conversation. So, I head to the kitchen and open up the fridge and found out that there's so many chocolates and many kind of it as well..   I think.. the chocolate part was a sign to quit eating them since it'll make me fatter day by day..hahahah

      Last night, I had few dreams. But I don't really remember all of it.  1st dream: I dreamt that I was jogging around my neighbourhood until I reached Nonie's house. I stop by her house and she somehow was searching for something. I ask her.. She said she's looking for her brother's skateboard which was missing. So, i help her searching for it. Found it though! It was at the balcony.  2nd dream: Now this one is rediculous. I dreamt that I ride a bicycle to Giangt supermarket. But i'm not quite sure which one. But It is definitely far since I remembered cycling across highways..hahaha

      Yesterday was so dissapointing kerana kegagalan on the mouse trap. But somehow this morning I succeed in catching 2 house rats. Both of them are stuck on the glue screaming for help. I felt a lil bit sorry, but.. thinking of the lil bird that was caught accidently yesterday makes me hate the rat so much.

      Have any of you guys tried the glue type of mouse trap? Well I did last night. Unfortunately this morning I realize that It wasn't a mouse that was caught but instead a cute little bird. I was so sad..  It was horrifying. however i manage to pull the lil bird off and the bird look like a ball. Both of her feet were stuck on her chest. The wings were stuck to her body and even her beak were stick together. She can't even open her mouth. I feel really bad for her. I tried cleaning her up. Finally I manage to make her flip her wings, open up her mouth and believe me, she bites!! And she manage to hop a lil bit. Well.. at least that's the best I could have done. Then I put her on the grass and I saw her hopping! I hope that she'll live!!

      My parents were out of town again! Last weekend they just got back from Alor Setar.. and now, again.. dissapeared. Anyway.. this is my chance.. I'm actually was in a process of clearing up some junk kat belakang rumah tuh. So.. only yesterday, I manage to get 3 full big plastic bag to get rid..    It's just that both of my parents have a habit of keeping junks. I just can't stand it. BTW.. those three bags doesn't include 1 big rack full of some sort of besi buruk! My father loves very much keeping those stuff and keeps telling me not to get rid of it because it might be useful one day. I wonder when will the one day be?? It has been there for years! My mom in the other hand pulak loves so much buying new kuali, periuk.. etc. Too much of it which has caused us the lack of space in our not so big home. The reason for buying is.."We haven't got this size of periuk yet".

      Last weekend was so damn letih giler. On Saturday, i have to wake up early eventhough I ended up sleeping late at my aunt's watchhing survivor finale. Anyway, my uncle was moving out to a new home at USJ on that very day. So.. I was helping him around.(does carrying my handbag and paper cups count??? :P)  2pm Saturday, was the final episode for 'Secreto de Amor'. So, I ended up sitting right in front of the tv for 2 hours only to watch a common stupid happy ending. Ada ke kawin kat rumah kat meja bulat tuh jer.. Well that was not the end of my Saturday.. I was hanging out with my aunt sampai late night.  On Sunday Morning pulak.. hoping to wakeup late.. My dad called asking me to pick him up at the airport..:( Aiiyooo.. then my mom wants me to buy some groceries pulak.. Back from groceries.. another one of my aunty wants me to accompany her to KL visiting her aunt. Last night.. I thought I could have an early tido.. but infact.. my cousin pulak came for a visit at 10pm..  Well.. that explain my sleepy eyes this monday morning.. ZZZZzzzz..

I've decided to learn YOGA in order for me to be able to handle my stress better. Hope it works. I've just bought an 'introduction to yoga' VCD. It's much harder than I thought it would be.

      I've been wondering for life.. why is my life is stuck with my parents forever. I've been living with my parents for 24.5 years (that is lifetime) I've never leave home not even once. However.. these few years have made me realize that my parents somehow still can't face the fact reality that I'm getting old. Their biggest concern is always be their family. What about me?? Don't I have the right to built my own family??  I'm going through a very rough time dealing with my parents these days. My life is really a living hell. My mom is a very busy working women. Pluss.. her highly ambition thinking, makes her busy with her studies as well. My dad infact is a pensioner. But that doesn't make him free as a bird. His highly social life these days makes him busy with early jogging, morning teh tarik, golfing and not forgetting the late night teh tarik at GAZEBO almost every night. I, somehow end up cleaning dishes all day. It's easy to scream at my little brothers to make sure they do their own cleaning of dishes and laundry. But how am I supposed to scream at the elders??  Every single day of my life have been depressing lately. I've got headaches almost every time coming home for lunch at noon and end up not having the time to make myself even a bowl of maggi mee.. but instead.. I'm spending time cleaning off the dishes and kitchen. Same goes coming home in the afternoon. I wonder what do these people have been doing in 4-5 hours time.  However.. I'm so thankful and grateful to have some friends that wouldn't mind listening to my mumbling (hopefully). Thank god.. my dearest darling has always prepared himself to be screamed whenever my hormon level aren't stable. He has been the most patient guy I've ever met. Love you.. Darlin..

      Last Saturday, I had an ex-schoolmate reunion. It was a blast! Long lost friend was reunited.. From the way I see it.. some of them changed a lot.. physically and mentally.. But some.. never change. Same style, same look and of course.. some with the same attitude.  Some are married, some are engaged, some remain single.. and of course there are some that is still stuck with the old long term relationship.. hehehe (I wonder who?? :P)  Anyway.. almost each one of us including me have planned to leave the party early, but we end up leaving at almost midnight. From what i heard, many of the guys leave at around 4pm.. and yes.. that include my dearest darling.  Pictures.. not yet... filem byk lagi. But i'll try to upload the piccies whenever it's ready.

      I had a long sleep last night. I went to bed at 10.30pm and got up at 8.30. Late for work though! Yesterday I finally bought my Yoga Mat. That means I can start doing my Yoga next week. Fuhhh.. can't wait!  Tomorrow evening I'll be leaving for family vacation at Genting Highlands. Eventhough I'm hoping for a good relaxing weekend.. I doubt!! I'm sure it'll be a damn tired weekend. Spending time with my family, cousins, aunties, uncles is more tiring than spending time with Nonie..hahahahaha :P  I feel that I've been putting on some weight these few weeks. Starting next week.. there'll be Yoga and healthy eating diet and swimming if I get the chance. I really need to reach my target weight in two months time.

Damn tired since we slept at almost 4pm. Many cleaning to do at her new place. We even tried on her new TV antenna. I'm actually too excited that the fact she's moving into my neighbourhood. It's gonna be so much fun I hope! I really hope that one day I'll be able to move into my own home where I don't have to bother about parents' nag!! It'll be so much fun to be able to live with my own sets of rules.

      It's monday morning.. Well my house at the moment is under construction. My dad decided to make a new flooring for the bathroom. But, the part that I hate is that.. not only the mess it makes.. but also the fact that both my parents are out of town at the time of this construction. Damn it!! So.. of course i have to live with that situation on my own.  The good part of them being away is.. I manage to clean  up another part of the house...[The Bathroom] and manage to trow away 1 whole big plastic bag full of junk. Hehehehe I think the next time they went out of town.. another part of the house will be gone!! :P

      I fell that I have so much things to say.. but can't seem to be able to put the words in order. Maybe because there's some kind of sour situation between me and my mom last night. I'm trying my very best not to remember it cause it'll give me pain to my brain! I'm having enough headache for the whole week anyway. Don't need more of those.

      20th June will be my graduation day. I'm so looking forward to it. But it's not just any graduation day.. It's also a day when my parents will be seating next to my dearest darlin Fajar. I'm so damn nervous!! For any of you guys out there who doesn't know yet.. My parents are not very keen of me going out with this regular guy. They have very high expectation on me in every angle which include choosing the man of my life. I've been praying so hard that my parents will start living in reality and accepting my decision. I know god hears my prayer every single day. And I know that god will help me to go through the toughest time. Please make my graduation day a happy day not a sour day.

      These few days, weeks, months and years.. I've been thinking and even did some research on how to live my life my own way. I've been living with my parents eversince I was born. Never leave home, not even once. I live my life the way my parents want me to. Finally.. god has gave me some sort of the solution. My mom has been decided by her boss to be transferred to Sarawak next month. I'm not sure for how long. But I'm sure she'll take my dad, and my lil brother with her. So, there leaves me alone to rule my own life. I'm quite excited. I hope it all went the way I see it. Hope there's no such thing as babysitter for me pulak!! If there is.. I'm dead!!

      Overall.. my graduation was okay. Syukur alhamdullilah. I was quite dissapointed that my mom couldn't attend the ceremony. She forgotten about it and have made other plans for the day in Tanjung Malim. But what really confius me is that she told people that I was the one who didn't remind her. I did actually told her on the day I receive the invitation and there's this one day that she ask me when is the ceremony, asking the date. So, i assumed that she jot it down on her planner like all other of her appoinments and of course remind my dad about it. But instead.. she didn't! So.. even my dad knows nothing about it.   But anyway.. finally the decision was only my dad would be able to make it. None of my other family came. Luckily there was my dearest sweetheart to accompany me. We took some pictures.  Anyhow.. frankly I'm glad everything goes well..

      It's Thursday morning and here I am thinking of my neverending 'life is a living hell' theory. Again and again some slight argument came across me and my mom. I really hate the tight situation between me and her. I've been praying hard to make her realize I'm a 25 year old single lady that needs some space and air to breath. Is it because I'm not praying hard enough or at the same time instead, she is praying for the opposite side of my prayers...hahahaha If that's the situation, it's really gonna be a neverending stress life I'll be living in.  I just don't understand! Why is it that I've been put into this kind of situation? Why is she making things hard for me?? The most difficult part is that the fact that I have no choice but to live with it!! I hate the situation I'm living in!  She really have to stop being denial! I did my part, why can't she did her part??

      Last month, I was really over the budget..hahaha the funny thing is.. I'm not quite sure how did that happen. From what I remembered I don't see any new stuff that I bought. Hmmm.. that was a mystery!  Nevermind.. for July, I hope that everything goes according to the budget. It's just that I'm having some kind of sickness which is 'Over Spending Syndrom' Hahahaha..

      Last night was great..hehehe. Since the idea of me going out seeing my friends are not going to make peace between me and my mom.. So.. I decided to invite my friends over instead. We had long discussion on life..hahaha At the same time reading Bridal megazines. We were discussing what kind of dress we're making for our wedding which we don't know when will that be..:P  Anyway.. I'm still having trouble accepting the fact of me having to babysit my cousin 3 days a week. That will give me a slight difficulty. That's because I have to make sure to be home early those three days and prepare dinner for her as well. I wonder how am I supposed to do that.

      Last night my mom finally mention about the plan of me after she leave for Sarawak. Well.. her first question that came up last night was, have I ask somebody to live with me when she's gone. I simply said that I intend to live alone. And obviously she's not taking it well. She freak out on the fact that I'll be living alone and how dangerous it is. I think.. rather than my mom being paranoid and worried that the fact that I'm living alone.. it's better if she pray for my safety. But instead she's been mumbling.. something's gonna happen to me if I live alone.  Anyway.. I don't think I'll be able to live my life my way sampai bila-bila. I'm meant to be carrying lots of responsibilty my whole life. I still have a cousin to be taken care of 3 days a week. It's killing me knowing that I can never make use of my life to the fullest.   I think the only way these people will understand what I'm feeling and experiencing is by reading this blog! Difficult life!!

      My stress level is ultimately high! Yesterday I went to pick up my contact lenses in Shah Alam. At the same time browsing for my aunt's birthday gift. Then I got a phone call from Nonie. So, we decided to have early dinner at McDonalds. It was around 6:40pm. Then we had a quite long chat. To cut things short.. I reach home at 8pm. My mom at that time was furious of me being home late!! I just don't get it!! I don't think I was late!! To make things worst, she did her lecture rite in front of my aunt!! I think she's not treating me like a 17th year old anymore. But instead she's treating me like a 12 year old!! I really hate this!!!  Last night as well, I've just find out that my aunt will be transitting her 7 year old daughter at my house every Wednesday and Thursday. She has night classes. So, I guess that leaves me a new responsibility after my lil bro left for Sarawak! The reason I'm so angry about this is because nobody even care to ask my opinion on this!! They just do as they like!! Just simply wanna put a responsibility on my shoulder without my concern. They could at least ask me or consult me wether I'll be okay about it. I know what it feels to take care of other people's child. And knowing her(my 7 year old cousin), not easy to be taken care of. Especially with a fussy mother she has. And that's my mom's sister we're talking about. So.. I guess.. the thought of having quality prime time on my own every day.. GONE!!!!!!

      Did you guys know that too much sleep will make you more sleepy than u already are? Well, it did! I had an extra long nap yesterday evening. That gives me extra eyes to manage to watch 2 movies last night Hehehehe. I watched 'Along came Polly' and 'Something's gotta Give'. I end up sleeping at 3am and waking up at 8.30. Phewww.. almost late for work today. And now.. I'm having a sleepy eyes syndrom.  I've been locking myself in my room almost the whole time yesterday. I just don't feel like bumping into my parents face. Just to cool me down.. I prefer staying in my room.. alone.  I missed my beloved Darlin so much. Haven't seen him for 2 weeks, I think. That was when he had the Doctor's appoinment the other day. This coming weekend.. well i'm not sure if I'll be able to see him either. Hopefully yes. But there's this some slight of 'how do i make it possible'. I just hate it when things get sour between me and my parents after spending lots of time with him. Not just him, things also gets sour when I spent too much time with my girlfriends. Hate that situation so much!  This coming Friday, my mom's little boy will be performing at Ntv7 again. This time I'll try my best to escape from going to that Ntv7 crap. It seems that my parents like to treat me like a 17 year old, might as well... I be one sometimes. It might be fun..Hehehehe

      Do you have any idea how tough it is to be a 25 year old single lady without a perfect lifestyle but WITH a 'perfect' parents who always think you're 17?? Such a hecthic life I'm living in.  I had a great weekend. being able to see my younger brother in Perak after a month we haven't seen each other. But last night was a mess between me and BOTH my parents. Well.. same issues every single day. I'm not gonna mention it again cause all readers will get bored of it. In fact you guys must have already been bored listening to my mumble grumble.

      I'm still at the office. Not much work actually. But just to stay out of home more..hahahaha. Two weeks till my parents move to Sarawak. Looking forward to it. I'm trying to work things out between me and my family's commitment. For a time being, things are doing quite fine. I manage somehow to handle things well..with my own way of course! So, hopefully that everything will turns out well.

        Di Pintu Syurga   Sekukuh... Sekukuh mana ikrar kasih kita Setebal mana masih ada sempadannya Akan tiba nanti... Harus ditempuhi Apa daya kita melawan masa  Takdirnya... Takdirnya dunia hanya sementara Walau begitu cinta suci tuk selamanya Ini realiti... Hilang tak terganti Namun ku tahu kau dan aku akhirnya kembali bersatu  ( korus ) Andainya ku pergi sebelummu Kenangkanlah ku selalu didalam doa mu Kaulah cinta pertama dan terakhir untukku Ku berjanji kan menanti mu Setia menunggu di pintu syurga  Di sana... Di sana menanti gemilang cinta Jadi lenyapkanlah titisan air mata Tabahkanlah hati mengharungi hari Abadikanlah saat indah... Kita kan tetap bersama  ( ulang korus )    This song is my favourite number eversince I first heard it. Sang by KRU and Elite. It'll be my theme song between me and my dearest.

      I just don't understand, why is it that some people really just can't accept a defeat. My brother lost last night with one of the Topstar competitor. Why can't he just accept taht he actually lost and just do better the next day? He really is being a kid when everybody is trying to comfront him last night. There is my mom, my aunt and my uncle.  I think, my brother should practise playing cards with me first. If he can handle the lost againts me 5 times in a row. Then I think he's ready to compete in a bigger competition on national TV.  Why can't he realize that he have everybody to support him in anything he's doing. Especially the mother lah! She always make sure that I attend my brother's competition live at the studio. No matter what, I have to go. Unless I'm sick, then that's a good reason not to go. At first I went there to watch him live to give him my support. But since I was forced to go the other day, I just go for the sake of his mother. His mother remember every date that he'll be performing at the studio and always make sure she spent some time to watch him on TV. Wherelse my mother instead, didn't even have the courtesy to jot down my graduation date on her planner. My mother never liked my interest. For her, my interest is a waste of time. Whatever I liked doing is never what she liked doing. My brother have the same interest as his mother. He should be thankful for that. And he also should be thankful to have a sister who always being patient with his stupid and childish attitude! Sometime I think my 18 years old lil brother is more mature than that 27 year old kid!

      I had a long weekend rest staying at home. Just to avoid any unneccesaryness between me and my mom. It kinda work and it gives me time to think and plan about how do I deal with my responsibility towards me and my cousin after my parents left for Sarawak.  I was thinking of doing my Yoga everytime my cousin is around. So.. at least she can just watch me doing it while doing her homework rather than just watch me sleep... Hahaha. Regarding dinner, I'm gonna teach her to eat whatever I eat. Her mother have to understand that I'm not really a person who loves to cook rice and some dishes just for her little girl. I just hate the hassle to prepare dinner just for one person. I'm actually a bread eater. I can just have a toast bread for dinner. So.. maybe I guess I could make some scramble egg for her rather than some 'Gulai Lemak'. And also.. I've invited Nonie for dinner those 2 days. At least there'll be dinner for 3 instead of 1. If happens that I don't feel like cooking, just take her to the warung for dinner la.. I think that's the only way.

      I really am running out of days. 9 days left.. and I still haven't started on my new year love vows. I'm completely blank! And yes, of course..&nbsp; no gift yet.. still working on it. I guess.. 'From This Moment', I'm out of ideas..hehehe  Yesterday.. I went to KL. I tag him along since he's working on night shift. Then we had lunch together. We took the LRT instead of driving there.. so, we manage to came up with many conversation all the way. Somehow we analyze one thing about us. We had a fight everytime there's a big occasion coming up. For example, birthdays, anniversaries or valentines. We figured it out why those situation happened. When big occasions are coming, we tend to try make things too perfect for both of us in our own special unique ways. That would cause a misunderstanding when one side doesn't agree with the other. Now, to make us less fighting over stupid things.. we need to remind ourselves everytime things get tense.  It's not easy to be in a too long relationship. It can be torn anytime if we're not being sensitive enough. For the part 6 years, I've been through so many things in my life involving him. Only those who've had a long term relationship starting on early years would understand how it felt. The tought of losing&nbsp;my teenage life or&nbsp;younger days over him. It felt like as if I can't picture myself without his involvement in my life. I lost my days of dating guys, experience on few short term love and heart breaking. When I really have a thought of it.. I kinda felt like I missed those years that I will never experience ever in life. But I'm also glad that I lose those years to a person that I love most.&nbsp; I'm glad that we manage to go through 6 of our young years together. We've been though many things.. sometimes when I thought about it, some of it were quite funny...hahaha  Hmm.. I better work on my vows..   &nbsp;

      I do swear…that I’ll always be there…  I’d give anything and everything and I will always care  Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow,  For better for worse, I will love you  With every beat of my heart   From this moment…life has begun  From this moment…your are the one  Right beside you is where i belong  From this moment on  From this moment…i have been blessed  I live only for your happiness  And for your love i’d give my last breath  From this moment on   I give my hand to you with all my heart  Can’t wait to live my life with you can’t wait to start  You and i will never be apart  My dreams came true because of you   From this moment…as long as i live  I will love you…i promise you this  There is nothing…i wouldn’t give  From this moment on  Oh oh   You’re the reason i believe in love  And you’re the answer to my prayers from up above  All we need is just the two of us  My dreams…came true…because of you   From…this…moment as long as I live  I will love you, i promise you this  There is nothing i wouldn’t give  From this moment I will love you as long as i live  From this moment on&nbsp;    This is a song from Shania Twain. I love the lyrics so much indeed. It meant so much to me. I dedicate this song for my dearest darlin.. Love you so much..

      Last night.. I had a real bad headache. Plusss.. there's some slight sharp pain in my stomach. So, I took an early bed. My dearest darlin however ring me up at 1am. It was a very long conversation. Many issues were discussed. Luckily we didn't end up fighting or anything.. hahaha  Frankly.. we've been busy with each of our life alone. There's been quite sometime since we spent an hour or two alone together. We've been stuck with our so called life schedule. We&nbsp;hardly even&nbsp;have time for a coffee at starbucks. I've realize that we've been missing those sweet days so much. I thought, there's more other things to deal with rather than just spending 1-2hrs at starbucks with him. But somehow I've just realize how i've been missing life with him. We'll both try to find time for each other more often now. Hopefully...  10 more days to our 6th Anniversary... I'm still working on our new year's vows. Pluss.. I still haven't got the time to get him anything yet.

      Looks like my parents will still stick to their decision on getting me a babysitter.. Well, meet my babysitter:-   Full Name : Mohd Fadzil Mohd Salleh  I Call Him : Cik Dil  Relationship with me : Uncle and Niece  Age : Early 40's  Maritial Status : Divorce  Occupation : Businessman   I'm having a very hard time accepting the situation since I heard my parents decision this morning. There goes my blue mood.. turning into anger. That's what I meant when I said I can't handle another pain in my ass. Enough of my trouble with my boyfriend, and now here come another issues of life. I just don't&nbsp;understand why is it so hard for them to accept my decision?? Why do they have to be so dificult to me?? They don't get the point that I'm tired of living with other people and I wanna live by myself!   I have a very sad life!! What is sadder than not having our own life to live? What is sadder than not being able to make our own decision of life? What is sadder than to live a life based on other's people rules and regulation? What is sadder than not having the freedom to live? I think at this very moment, my life is the sadest life of all.. :(

      5 days to go.. and we've screwed things up! I knew this was gonna happen! We see each other last Friday.. things got a lil bit messy.. we kinda had a fight. And as usual.. I'm having difficulty dealing with it. I'm in my silent mood. Don't feel like arguing or yelling.. so I decided to stay silent this time.  Frankly.. I'm not very sure wether&nbsp;I should be looking forward to 31st July or not. But i'm definitely tired of having this kinda blue feeling. I'm having a very horrified moment dealing with my life at this very moment. I don't think I can handle another pain in my ass!

      The new era of my life has already begun. I'm finally had the opportunity to life my life my own way. The excitement was terrific! I did the house cleaning not having to worry the mess that nobody will make. Cleaning the house and cooking somehow is becoming my new hobby..hahaha  And of course.. the babysitter part.. He's no longer needed since I've invited my long lost friend to live with me. So.. that part was settle.. Eventhough I didn't had the chance to live alone.. but I have my privacy.. still. As for my lil cousin that I thought I was supposed to babysit on some days of the week.. Well.. no actually.. only sometimes when both her parents is stuck with something.  About last weekend house ruling.. I was a bit pissed of with my aunt.. But I've decided to lay calm and just live with her attitude. Like the Malay said.. 'Just close one eye ler' this coming weekend.. my mom will be in town.. Hmm.. I guess.. I don't really feel that she has moved to East Malaysia. As for me.. she's just out of town for some business trip.. :P Nothing much change between me and her.. still the same kind of relationship..  This coming weekend.. another hectic day coming since my brother will be in town and performing at ntv7 again. I really am not the type that will attending some mini concert. All those cheering raising hands.. It's just not me..hahaha We'll see what will happen this coming weekend..
