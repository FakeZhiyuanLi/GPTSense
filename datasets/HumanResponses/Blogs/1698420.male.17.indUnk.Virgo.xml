						   I had a dream last night. I was over at my friends house and people were everywhere, talking and laughing. I decided to go downstairs and I bumped into a girl and made some nonsense remark. After reaching the basement and sitting down, a girl I like(lets call her A) came over crying to me and her friends and everyone else started to stare at me. It had something to do with the girl on the staircase(I've come to realizes this girl is one of two people, a girl online who we shall call R, and a friend in real life, K.)). So I exlpained myself, with some help of demostration of the R/K, for some odd reason.  And suddenly A jumped into my lap smiling, everyone else went back to what they were doing. And she looked at me teary eyed and I kissed her and she didn't stop smiling as I held her.  I'm not sure what I expect to get out of this, wether I wrote this to help myself, or just remember. But enjoy a look into my mind.

						   Todays a new day. Lately I've been having problems, I've been feeling overly sad and depressed. Sitting around and doing nothing about it, looking for someone to help me out of it, looking for a friend. Well one friend talked to me and helped me, I looked inside myself and found the word 'new'.   I needed something new. So I decided to try something small first, I'm cleaning my room. I'm taking out all the garbage and old unwanted memories and I threw them away. I'm still working on my room.  Next I'm going to renew and double my efforts on my novel, I've finished the first book but I have two more to go. It might take awhile but I'm going to finish it.  After I finish at least the second book I'm going to dive deeper into my religion. I've been meaning to bring myself closer to the goddess and deeper into the Craft but I've been hitting road blocks over and over again, I know the Craft is for me and I wont give up on it.   So, I've got three things to do. Step 1: Clean room Step 2: Novel Step 3: Religon  That should keep me busy enough. I don't know if anyones reading this, but if you want to get ahold of me my e-mail is flynns13@hotmail.com. Please put 'thisisgoodbye' in the subject so I know not to delete it, thanks.  Off to bed, bane of man

						   I'm not quiet sure what to say in here, as you can see this is my first post in the history of well... me. I'm not even sure what I want out of this, I guess I just want something new in my life. So many things  are old, although I care for them dearly (some more then others) there just the same.  I've come to realize that I've lost parts of my identity, with my computer being unable to go to any of  the chat sites I used to go to I've been stuck where I am. I talk to the same people and every conversation  ends in the same way, they just go on to someone who has more to say then me.  I don't remember how to talk to people, I don't remember how to help people. I used to be good at helping  people but now I say what I can and they go to someone else, leaving me lonely and empty.  Such is life for me.  I guess I'm the typical teenage loner, sitting in the corner watching life go by. To shy to do anything to get into the action and left with the internet and writing to get his feelings out. I'm not sure if anyone will read this or if I'll tell anyone about it. For now I'll just write what I want to. Hopefully someone comments, mabye there is someone else sitting out there, mabye someone like me, mabye just someone. I'll just wait and see.   P.S. Thank you, whoever's reading this. Your three steps closer to caring then most people in my life

						   Its been awhile since I posted. I've been thinking lately, about people I miss, a love that I'm seeking and a love that I've lost. Confusion runs rampant inside of me. I know what I need, I know what I want, I know what I miss, and I know who I love and I know what I've lost. But I just can't seem to figure out how to get what I need and what I want. I can't do the things I want to because somethings not right, somethings not in place inside of me. I don't know what it is, somethings just shifted enough to make things wrong and make me uncomfortable. I hate this. This is where I end tonight, goodnight. And sorry for the abruptness of this ending, but I need to sleep. Got a reunion to go to tommorow.

						   What to write... I feel so off. I can't trust my friends anymore, they don't seem to trust me ethier. Things are drifting apart. I can only trust two of my friends now, the third broke my trust when he took a chance away from me to see a girl I'm starting to like, just so he could be with his girlfriend more.   I can't be here, I shouldn't be here. Every bone in my body aches with the words "go there" but I don't even know where 'there' is. I'm not needed here, someone else needs me. This isn't right. I dont' belong here, I feel unimportant and just lost. I have no purpose here. I'm useless. I can't do anything, I can't help anyone, and I don't think anyone could help me, well, one person mabye, but thats only because were so alike in lots of ways, its strange really. Shes one of the few people I trust. I want to go, I need to go, I have to help, I need purpose, I need out of whatever I'm in.  I don't know why I keep posting here. I don't know if anyone reads this. I don't know If I even want someone to read this. But I do, or else I wouldn't bother. Well if you reading this, thank you, it means something to me.

						   The flame that burned within my soul has dimmed. The fire's are burning low. My creativity has become more dorment within myself. I sit before you all naked, in body and in sould. I rolled out of my bed, darkness surrounding me, but I knew they way. I sit in front of the computer screen, its famillier cold glow illuminating just what I need. The keys; play them. I want to let my fingers fly, I want to create something beautiful, but I can't, not yet, I need something, I need an inspiration. I have had many inspirations to help me along my path; authors. Authors help me understand, help me learn, stoke the flame thats inside of me. J.R.R. Tolkien, Ray Bradbury, Piers Anthony, Margret Weis, Tracy Hickman, Terry Goodkind, Steven Brust, so many more... people I don't even know touch me with every word. I want to.... I don't know anything any more... I honestly don't. I try to learn but I don't, with everyday I seem to loose something. I don't even know why I'm typing this. Why do I bother writing this inane rambling. Why do I bother listening to the click of the keys as my fingers wind there way arcoss them. Its so fammilier, the keys, the way they tinkel and ring in there own way. I can hard see my own words. I'm blind. I'm blind. The flame is growing but to what end I do not now... a simple forty three pages has caused me to write this, caused my imagination to grow just a bit more. Why am I so hollow?... Why am I here? Why aren't I in some place more, why aren't I part of something greater then this? Why am I nothing more then this? A naked 17 year old, no glasses to let me see things, no clothes to hide my imprefections, no sheild to protect my soul. I'm open tonight, read what you want, take what you want, this is yours. I feel the door closing already. Why wont someone stick there foot in it? Help me keep it open... I don't know anything at all any more...The keys fall silent...I don't know what to do... does this even make sense to you? Should it?... I don't know...I don't know....nothing to know...never let go...no chance to grow... time moves to fast... so hard to know...I can't see.

						   its 12:40am...do you know where you are? I'm in my new room. Its scary, everythings different...I'm only going to sleep tonight because of how tired I am from all the moving. My backs sore and I've been hurting my foot all day. Woo, what fun...I miss my room.... I couldn't stand to see my brother touching everything...trying to take down my posters...it was horrible...  And now things are worse...I'm hurting people...I'm hurting myself by having feelings for more then one girl... I'm hurting one of those girls by being honest with her... shes given me everything she has and all I can do is hurt her with the truth...my hearts so fucked up...ever since it was broken by one girl a long time ago. Its healed wrong, if its even healed. I can't love just one girl anymore...I'm to scared of what will happen...but I've got to go to sleep now...school night and all.....why am I such a fucking dick?

						   Its been awhile since I posted. Wow, that sounds famillier. Well I'm sitting her, its 2:40 am and I have no coffee. I'm cleaning my room, organising it. I'm moving. Not far, just swapping rooms with my brother, he wants to try something upstairs. And as I look around, having spent the day cleaning (still not done yet) I've seen so many memories of things I've lost, things I thought I had thrown away, things I never thought I'd see again. I'm going to miss my room. Its full of so many memories. Taking my brothers hockey cards under the cover of a tiny flashlight when me and my brother shared it as children. Talking on the phone at midnight and yawning and saying "I love you." in the morning as I watched the sun peak through my window. The night I giggled giddily to my love as I proposed to her and she said yes. The nights I shivered in fear of the things in the dark. Thousands of hours of music echo in this room. Tears stain the floor when my love and fiance left me for another. Pins holes rittle the walls like some mobster movie; the marks of my posters. Crying as I wished the music would make the pain go away as I was rejected by a girl who I'd come to find dear after years of piecing my heart back together. I look around this room and I feel tears...So much sadness has happened in this place compaired to happiness... I've had to rearrange this room a few times to ease the pain... so when I watched the sun rise from that angle the memories wouldn't make me cry. But even then it was still the same room. The room I got caught smoking weed in, the room I read my first book in, the room I made my own... Now that room is going to leave...I'm going to have to start over again...At least I'll have this blog to remind me of what I've left behind...I'm going to go hold back the tears now... Goodnight reader...goodbye room

						   I feel bad... About two blogs ago I wrote somethings when I was feeling very hurt and torn and said some things I wish I hadn't have said. But they are up here now and people have seen them already so I will not take them down. I will not censor my thoughts no matter how much they hurt me or someone else to read. All I can say is I'm sorry to that person, but we both have to deal with what I said regardless of whether its up or not.

						    A Martini Glass  Rose petals in a martini glass; smelling sweet only in death. An empty pill bottle and a body on the floor; her shoulders could hold no more. Glass beads sewn in a false face; mocking a life that isn't there. A full page of empty words; echoing the pains of a life lost. A picture frame and a forced smile; all that will ever remain. Rose petals in a martini glass; I smell them every day.                       By: Seth G. Smith   This is a poem I wrote a few nights ago. I ment to write up this post before the previous one, when I was in a better mood, but things change. I don't know why I wrote that poem. Everything just felt so right while I was writing it out... the only thing I might work on is the ending... I've got a different one that might fit better... we will just have to see wont we?  Its strange... I actually do have a martini glass full of rose petals in my bedroom... Interesting how things work out, no?

						   Devistation comes with the simplest of words: "I am done with this. I can't juggle you, ***, my job, my best friends and my family. I had to sort my shit out and I really can't handle you any more. I am sorry. Good bye Seth. Please don't call"  A close friend who stopped talking to me about 7 months ago because of her jealous boyfriend, ends our friendship with this... Now that I think about it she never really cared about me... I should have realised how disposible I really was the moment she told me we couldn't talk... I want to yell at her... I've got the insults and the pains in my mind swirling about... but she wouldn't bother with them... she'd just delete them even if I did send it... I will send something though to her.... this site.... this little piece of me with the words "Read it, or don't. Either way you can go to hell. You were never really my friend, you disposed of me months ago for the lusting of your lonely heart." Maybe I'll just copy and paste that and send it...Can I say I tried to stay her friend? Did I try to hard or in the wrong ways? Ethier way its over, the damage is done... Everything is fucked over now.... And I was just starting to heal... why could she have just told me to leave her alone 7 months ago? or not even start talking to me again in the first place....She can go to hell... she broke my trust and another piece of my already fragmented heart. Damn her, may she always feel empty no matter how perfect things seem.

						     You are Agent Smith, from "The Matrix." No one would ever want to run into you in a dark alley. Cold as steel, tough as a rock, things are your way or the highway.    urlLink   What Matrix Persona Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Yet another quiz that seems to hold some truth...Disturbing now...looking back at the other quiz's...interesting how it works out huh? They all end up relating to each other in some way... I'm tired right now, its about 3am... I'm glad I decided to post all of these quiz's...it will give me something to look back on, it will give me something to compair too... Not that I'll have changed that much at all, I tend to stay the same, no matter how badly I want to break out into someplace or someone that I have no clue about. I write about who I want to be, a desire to be someone else goes into the characters in all of the stories I write... I need to get more creativity out...I'm starting to lag behind in my Writer's Craft class....A stories due on monday and I haven't started it... at least I could type something for an 'Not RFA' and at least get the marks for it... Well I've got to go to sleep now...mabye I wont wake up and stay in a dream... that would be nice.... goodnight

						     You represent... angst. You have an extremely cynical outlook on just about everything.  It's okay to sulk and be depressed, but life is short, and you only get one.  It's only what you make it, and only you can make it improve.    urlLink   What feeling do you represent?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I represnt Angst...who knew?... Quiz's always seem to know who you are...they know everything even though their just a set of variables and 1's and 0's with preset outcomes...the tend to come out pretty close to reality...who knows more? The program or the person who wrote it?.... I wonder and sigh.

						     You are naturally born with a gift, whether it be poetry, writing or song. You love beauty and creativity, and usually are highly intelligent. Others view you as mysterious and dreamy, yet also bold since you hold firm in your beliefs.    urlLink   What Type of Soul Do You Have ?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     I was reading a friends blog and I thought I'd try the same quiz she did. Here I am, an Artistic soul. I've never considered myself an artist, altough I suppose I am one of sorts. I just write what I feel when I feel. Mabye someday I'll post one of my stories on this site so someone out there can see what it is... Well how has life been for me... well I've been craving people, human contact. I want to go out and be socialble with friends and try and meet someone new, but I can't. I'm never invited to parties unless one of my friends is told to bring friends, then I MIGHT be invited. Its hard....theres so many things I need that I can't have, or that I've lost.  I e-mailed one of my friends last night in reply to hers... she wants to go back in time to when things were better, things were different and she was happy. I look back and don't really seen any moments of happiness I could go back to. Every moment of happiness I had was no more then a night, a few hours, even minutes, before it stopped, before someone broke it or something happened. My life hasn't had very many long happy moments, and it seems the longer the happiness lasted the more painful its ending was.... I'm tired of this all... I want to go, I need to get away... but I've been saying that to much lately, anyone who's read this knows how I feel, at least in some small way. Well I must be off now... I think I might be catching Whooping Cough, we've had it going around our town. Goodnight, thanks for listening.

						   I want to write but I don't know what to say... its not often I write two blogs in such close proximity but this is a...odd occasion. I wish I didn't make her hurt... she hurt me a long time ago and shes beating herself up over it... I really wish I could fix this but I don't think I can... I feel so frustrated... all I want is to help her, but it seems all I'm doing is making things harder on her. What type of friend am I to do that?... I mean... I don't know what to say... I want to make things right but I can't... I'm going to keep trying... Even though its hard on me still... I know she'll read this, but I trust her enough to let her know. I wont censor my thoughts on this blog. This is where I say what I want...even if it hurts... *sings softly to himself, knowing that this can be true but knows its not this time*   " Just cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there..."  I just thought of an old old song that had alot of meaning to me that applies to this girl, but I'm not going to sing it. To much... to much for oen night... sweet dreams to you all.  And I hope she can forgive me.

						   Here I sit, ever thinking, never blinking, never twitching, always listening, forever sighing, not quite dieing, but far from living, and where has my mind gotten too?  Oh my heart is grey but lightend up. Like some ancient black and white movie where the contrast has been turned up to much. I want to make a heart I can wear on my sleeve, a nice grey heart with a dark black background and a little pin so I can wear my heart wherever I please or leave it at home alone so no one can hurt it. Oh wouldn't it be a delight to have your heart in your hands and do with it as you please rather then it guide your life? The glory of it all, I feel like dancing and singing and crying as I jump and spin around a lamp post on a rainy fall afternoon while everyone hides inside, wondering at the insane man who revels in the rain and crys for all to see. But no, I think I'll stay inside myself for now, but who knows? Maybe one day I'll break the seal and cry carelessly as I wear that heart upon my sleave.  Goodnight to you all, enjoy this oddity, for its a rare occurence indeed indeed.

						   Oh the pain! The pain of it all!  Exams are here and almost past. Thursday and friday I had an exam each day. One was chemistry, I think I did fairly well on it, and the other was Earth and Space. The worst class known to man. I finished the test in about 61 minutes. Now I've got the weekend and monday to recuperate before my Writers' Craft exam. I've got about 2:30 minutes to write a story and edit it. That should be fun. I'm not going to have the average for university. I need a 75% for the school I want to go to but I'm going to end up with like a 65+ or 70. Its so horrible, I honestly tried the hardest I could and all I get is a pitiful mark like that... I shouldn't say pitiful...this is shaping out to be the best mark I've gotten in about 5 years. Oh well, not like I could afford to go anyways...  I spent a little while tonight talking to a friend I hadn't been able to talk to in a long time. It was nice, it made me smile, the things talked about made me sad and the memories brought back made old wounds hurt. But its worth it, I'll endure the pain to help that friend even at the risk of hurting myself. Afterall...what else are friends for?  Well its getting late... but not as late as usual. Its about 11:20pm and those of you who read my blog know that I usually write these blogs late at night just before my mind and body expire. But tonight's a different night. I grow tired of this life... I want to go... I want to leave... but I'm willing to wait. So for now, I'm going to go pop some popcorn and lay on my bed, watching a movie and looking back on memories both fond and sad. Never forget your past, it holds to much value to be tossed away, even with the pain some will have to endure. Never give it up.   I keep wanting to type more...but I'm going to stop before it all turns into gibberish like my mind. Sweet dreams.  Don't forget me...

						   Ohh what to say? I've gone far to long without writing. Its hard to keep my eyes open, its late and I've got a throbbing headache...Have you ever stopped and looked around? Seen where you were going? Seen where others were going? Its so hard to watch people slipping away and see where you might end up... Its hard to look and see that who once was your best friend and see that she might change. But I guess if that happens it happens. I've been working hard at school, trying to get the marks to go to university. Its such a painfull thing to do to yourself, pushing yourself so hard knowing that a few percent difference can decide wheter you get in or you don't. Its hard to look at how much it costs to go to university when you have no money and no job, and your already trying hard at just trying to get the marks. Oh what to do.   Well something new in my life is my e-mail, ace_of_holes@hotmail.com. If anyone wants to e-mail me or add me to MSN, go ahead. I wont mind, nothing better to do. Well I'm off...going to go watch t.v., that damn idiot box.  Goodnight and farewell, for if I die tonight, you should know that I love you all. Even if I don't know you.

						    The woes and pains of alcohol . Me and my friends had such a good thing going. We hung out, we laughed together, we didn't talk to much about what was bothering us, we all trusted each other. And then came along alcohol. We were over at one of my friends houses for the night, about 12 of us, 6 of which left at about 12 am since they weren't staying the night. And well, things went down hill. We laughed, we hung out, we talked and joked and we drank. One of my friends ended up so drunk he can't remember anything (we're still trying to convince him that he thought the coat rack was some really skinny hot chick [please note, its working!]), one of my dear friends has had dozens of accuastions and rumors spread about her and it is destroying her. Friends talked behind other friends back and friends told other friends what the first friend told them. Now there are arguments and sides being taken, and all of this seems to have centred on one girl. Shes so sweet, shes nice to us all, she treats us like people, shes beautiful, and I have a crush on her. As well as pretty much half the other guys in our group. As well, I've just lost her too another one of my close friends. Thats the second girl I've had to see that happen with. But this time I'm prepared, I understand why, I don't know if she knows that I like her, I probably wont tell her now, not for awhile anyways. I care very deeply for her as a friend, more so then as a crush, although I'm not sure how I feel on this crush, because it seems to be a deep crush. Its not often I find a friendship in someone like I have with her, I'm scared to fuck things up. But for now I'll have to sit back and watch, help her as I can. Helping her, also is going to envolve a warning. I don't want her getting hurt. I care to much to let her get hurt.  I hate writing like this, I don't want to turn this into a gossip site, I don't want people to take my words wrong. But I'm putting this up anyways, take it as you will, don't spread it around or talk to anyone about it, unless its me of course. I am NOT going to censor my thoughts, your reading these as they all came out. So, please be kind, thats my heart your prodding at.  Lost and confused, a hole in my chest, what to do? what to do? I honestly don't know. Don't forget me ~Seth

						   Ahhh Valentines Day. The most hated day of all the year. A failed attempt to place a holiday in one of the dreariest months of the year. All this day does is depress us single folk, it hurts us and wounds us in ways those preppy people who don't go more then a week without a boyfriend can understand. This holiday is a day of broken hearts and tears. We spend all day realizing how really alone we are, this day lets all the old pains seep back. Well to you I say ... I say nothing. I just don't want to acknowledge this holiday again. Sweet dreams to all, the last 20 mintues are counting down.  ~Seth

						   Evening all,  I'm sick, worried, tired, I've got a headache, tad suicidal, depressed. Its not all that bad, its pretty much the usual.  I'm worried about my dog...she's getting prettty old... shes moaning constently no matter what shes doing and her hearins starting to go. She has been wanting in and outside of the house all the time and its been pissing us off... but it clicked to me tonight as I yelled at her (it was about the 20th time she'd wanted outside) and I realised, she probably wont be around for too much longer... So I feel sad about that. Tonight I went into the kitchen with her and got 4 dog treats. I gave her one in the kitchen and took the rest upstairs and gave one to my mom, dad, and brother and told them to give them to her when she came upstairs. She went around to all of us a little shyly and took each treat. By the end she was wagging her tail and looking around at all of us for more *laughs* shes such a cute annoying dog... I hope she makes it until summer... She loves being outside but hates the cold... I want to be able to take my dog for a long walk one day before the end. I hope she's got more then a few months in her, but we never know.  Well what else can I say. There isn't anything really special going on in my life. I made a pact with a close friend. We put our lives in each others hands.... I found something really odd a few minutes ago.. I'm sick so I was reaching for a bottle of Ibuprofen that I knew there was only one left in, and something in the back of my head said "too bad the bottles not full so I could end it all" It was a thought that drifted through my mind, a flash that came for only a second but stayed for a few mintues. It was such a casual thought it scared me. But I know pills aren't the way. They wont release me. I know what will but I wont talk about that. Because I wont do it, not as long as my friend holds true to our pact.   Well Sweet Dreams to you all. Please don't leave me alone.  ~Seth

						   Lost, losing, going, gone, returning, falling away. This isn't my day. I don't know whats gotten into me lately... I just acted like a dick to a friend online. Well I don't honestly know if we were friends, she changes her opinion of me so often. She likes me alot, she loves me, she hates me, she likes me, shes my friend, she hates me, she changes her mind. Shes discarded me many times, but she came back before, and I was willing to let her come back and be my friened. Truely all she ever was. But she has a problem with my advice and I find it hard to understand how she can put school above so many other things. I guess its because of how I feel towards things. I even put friends above family most of the time, when they aren't equal. But shes not that, and she... Well I don't know her. I honestly don't. I don't know if I want to know her anymore, the way she changes and hurts me so often with words like knives digging into my eyes. Because its hard to stab someone in the back when all you see is the words typed.  Have you ever layed down on the floor and stared upwards, wondeirng if this is what things look like from the bottom? I have, last night, I just layed down and stared up at my ceiling and looked all around. I like the bottom, theres some comfort in knowing nothing can be below or behind you. I always like my back to the wall, I hate people being behind me. I guess thats why I like helping people move forward, even though that tends to mean that I loose them somewhere along the line.  I'm taking some friends out to lunch tommorow, or buying it and bringing it back to school. I want to spend some of the money I have on friends. I horde my money until I find something I want. I'd rather buy them something to eat, keep them happy for a day, then have the comfort of knowing I have money if I need it. Friends need to be giving something every now and then.  I hate myself. I honestly do. I mean, I look in the mirror and all I see is some fat disgusting loser. The only thing I like are my eyes, I like how green and clear they can be. But lately they've darkend. My eyes tend to follow my mood that way. I've been in a very odd mood. I felt like singing and dancing and bursting into tears for all to see and I want to lay down on the floor and just sleep and I want to scream out 'love me' even though I know no one will and I want to hug everyone and let them know I'm there friend so I can bring a smile to there faces. But I want to go away, I want to travel and leave them all behind except mabye one, just so I have one friendly face nearby. Who would want to travel with me? No one would, if I asked any of my friends they'd say no. Or they'd say they'd want to but they'd rather just go with someone else. I want to backpack in Europe and wisit places in America and New Zealand, I want to go places that I've missed and know I feel close too. I want to find me. I'm so tired of being this massless blob. Emotionally and physically. I mean, no one loves the blob, the fat kid is never loved. All I am is a friend, a brother, a pal, a loser. No one loves me, no one takes the time to love me. Whoever said whats on the inside counts is a fucking liar. Ethier that or whats on the inside of me is worthless and means nothing to anyone but me, even though my faith in myself is dwindleing. I mean, how can people say 'you'll find someone, I know it.' when they are the ones who rejected me in the first place? I'm so tired of it. I've loved and the love hasn't been returned so many times I don't know why I bother. But I do bother, I still love, I listen to them and hope. I try to help them. Hell, if the person who rejected me wanted to date one of my best friends I'd still try to hook them up. I've done it before... But no ones done it for me, the ones who hurt you don't do anything for you. There are a select few I trust and understand why they did that even though it hurts. I know one of them is going to read this and beat herself up over it... but she knows i'm talking about her, and don't ok? this isn't just you. Its alot of people. I'm sorry, all I do is bitch on the blog to people who probably could care less or find what I say humorous in some odd way. But take what you will.   I want to cut myself, but I know I wont. I want to cut the back of my hand so I'll always remember the pain I endured as a teenager, as who I am now. I'm changing and I'll probably loose who I am and everyone around me. So I'm going to enjoy this. I'm going to stare at that knife for the next few nights and debate if memory is worth a scare... even though I know it is right now...  I'm going to go lay on the floor and stare at the ceiling for awhile before I go to bed, wishing I could cry myself to sleep but knowing the tears wont come. Thanks for reading, sorry for the bitching..  I'm nothing, I'm going, I'm gone,  forgotten already by you who I love.

						   Mayonase Sandwich. Mmm mmm artery clogging. Its 1:42am and I went to make myself a snack, got out the bread and mustard and mayo and the meat. Mayo'd up the bread and found the meat to be GREY. So now I'm eating a slice of mayonase coated bread.  I passed out at about 8pm and just woke up about half an hour ago. Not sure what to talk about really, just bored out of my head... Well, lets see whats going down in my life. I still feel to blame for what happened on the weekend, a friend tried to convince me of his way of beliving and I saw all the holes and empty propaganda (but if he can still belive in it faithfully, then I respect that and wont try to change his views to mine, nor would I normally), and I'm still as lonely. Big surprises there eh? I hate how I've been acting lately, I've been answering before I really think out the tone I want and everything comes out snobby and overpoweringly sarcastic, its mostly with my family but I feel like such an asshole. I'm going to try and stop myself, I'm tired of all the stuipd jokes I try to come up with. I'm going to try and think before I act. I need moderation.

						   Welcome to the Second Question of Conscience.  "Are you genuine? Or merely an actor? A representative? Or that which is represented? In the end, perhaps you are merely a copy of an actor." - Second question of conscience.  Friedrich Nietzsche    I'm a genuine copy... I'm a replica of something from some other time and I'm just mimicing my way through life... I'm nothing, but I could be everything... I am nothing... Isn't that a fine thing to admit to? I am nothing.  Stay tuned for the Third Question of Conscience coming soon... ~Seth

						   No one cares.... I got a friend of mine drunk... It seems that no one else cared what happened to her... they were all worried about what their parents were going to do to them... I worried about her all weekend... I've felt as if I was going to puke every waking moment since I found out what happened... Everyone else just laughed...laughed... no external sign that they gived a damn... I found out something that night that broke me too... sent a crack up my heart... same act, same scene, different characters, same effect... I wont say what happened... but if you look back in these blogs you can probably figure it out...  On the ride home - we had gotten in a friends van the next morning and drove to a bigger city to see Dawn of the Dead - I felt I should just undo the seat belt and open the car door... throwing myself onto the highway... imagined rolling to a stop and laughing at the car headlights as they came towards me and ended my pitiful exsistence.... How pathetic is that?.... Its not like things are that bad for me... Just things that I want are missing...things that I need are missing... things that seem within grasp are always denied... I ponder suicide....  Don't hold back...live life long... live life right... don't let go... every second counts... ~Seth

						   This is not my poem, I in fact, just read it about 5 minutes ago in a Dragonlance novel (Test of the Twins)   Lord Soth’s Song  Set aside the buried light Of candle, torch, and rotting wood, And listen to the turn of night Caught in your rising blood.  How quiet is the midnight, love, How warm the winds where ravens fly, Where all the changing moonlight, love, Pales in your fading eye.  How loud your heart is calling, love, How close the darkness at your breast, How hectic are the rivers, love, Drawn through your dying wrist.  And love, what heat your frail skin hides, As pure as salt, as sweet as death, And in the dark the red moon rides, The foxfire of your breath.   I like this poem, hopefully you do too.   Well hows life for me? I'm not sure... lately I've felt not myself. There is a me, and that is what you see here, I think. And then theres a outer me being developed to cope with the outside world. Also, inside of my mind are many conflicting...persons... I can feel three different views of mine inside of my mind, whenever I'm not focused on something they will talk and chatter about... I can feel all of me spread out between those three voices of me. I don't know if that makes sense. I'm trying here. The outer me is getting more and more outgoing, he's becoming more of an 'winging it' kinda guy, he doesn't think much before he acts, which is good in a way... I always used to think to quickly to react but now I react just as quickly, which leaves part of me behind. I almost wish I were the old me... silent, caring, a loner... But now I'm starting to have something in me I always wished for, and I'm not sure if I want it now. I'm chameleoning. I'm creating different guises for myself. The only original one I think is the one you see now, but even this one feels to be changing, I want to hold onto it badly, but I'm not sure if I can. I don't know how firm my grip is...   "You run ahead? Are you doing it as a shepherd? Or as an exception? A third case would be as a fugitive."  - First question of conscience . Friedrich Nietzsche   Read this and think about yourself... where do you fall in?... I hate categorizing myself, I don't know how, I don't feel right doing it. But I belive I'm a fugitive. Now what I'm running from I do not know. But I think its myself...  Stay tuned, if interested, for the next question of conscience coming soon.     A glimmer of hope,    A glint of life,    A shining tear,    And a fear of the knife.                       By: Seth G. Smith

						   Oh madness take me swift and sweet. To a suiting end I'll meet, Upon this river swift and sure. I'll come to die within the hour. Forgive me not for I never wronged, I go willingly into this deep.  Not sure what that means, but out it came at 4:54am. Enjoy  ~Seth

						   Suicide Death Insanity Madness  My minds with them now.   Apple for an Eye  Things aren't right, Your lost inside, Your broken and twisted Your mad and clear (or clearly mad) Your hearts been broken Your glazed in glass (look but dont' touch) But I can help Its simple indeed, a fair trade. A taste of life, for half your sight This apple I'll give you, for that plain old eye This will help, this will cure, a simple trade. I'll take that eye and blind you from pain. But I'll give you this apple to free your body. Taste earthly delights for the loss of light. Its a simple trade, its fair indeed. I traded both mine, and look at me. So trade me your eye, and this apple you'll have. But be forworned, how I miss mine.    Theres a poem for you all. Its horrible, I know. Not just in content but in style and it probably doesn't make much sense but there it is. Oh well, I'm lost. I'm off to sleep.  I think I'm going mad...

						   Its 2:19 am, time for a qoute.  The person who completes suicide dies once. Those left behind die a thousand deaths, trying to relive those terrible moments and understand...  ~unknown    I've been reading up on some suicide stuff. I've read suicide notes, quotes from novels such as Hamlet, I've read the last entry of a young mans' journal. And you know what I've found? I've found that maybe suicide isn't as bad as it seems, maybe it is. Who knows what truely happens after we die? Do we simply disapear? Do we just vanish? Do our thoughts linger as our bodies decay? Do we go to heaven? Do we burn in hell? Is this hell rigth now? Have I died before? Am I who I think I am? Maybe we have a time limit, maybe when our times up here we advance to the next level, the next universe, the next life, maybe suicide is a shortcut to the next world? Am I just a memory? Am I all thats left? Is this world my imagination? Am I just a player in a game? Maybe I'm the video game, maybe something is immersed in some intense virtual reality and I'm his or her character. Do I have a continue? Do I risk what I have right now for something I don't know anything about? Should I bet against the odds? Should I roll the dice? Should I fold? Should I play with the cards I've been dealt? Is suicide a sign of courage or cowardice? Would I really be able to slit my wrists? Swallow a pill? Pull the trigger? How weak am I? Who has the strength to actually kill themselves? Do I?...  Theres alot of questions in my mind, enjoy reading them if you can....

						   I found the perfect suicide note:  I've got everything I need - Almost, Something is missing, however I've got no clue, I guess I have to go And search some other place to find it.  I'll get my coat.    This would be my suicide note if I ever did it. Its how I feel... I hate being who I am... the thoughts I think... I'm destroying myself, my thoughts and crushing me, and my thoughts are building a wall... I don't know what to do... but death isn't the answer, I've got much more to try before it comes to that... bye for now....  I told you not to leave me alone...

						   Ever forgot to breathe? Last night I was sitting in front of my computer, and so much power was going into my mind I didn't breathe. I had to force myself to once I noticed.  I'm going insane, I swear. The last two days I've been drawing this picture of Alice and Wonderland (I'll scan and post it when I'm done) and its messed up to me.  My wrists cry out for the feel of a blade, one in paticular because I know its sharp. I was just laying in my bed and though about just slitting them, just to see what happens, just to release the pressure, just to let myself go, just just just... I'm so philosphical. I had a debate with myself in the middle of english class (in my head, not out loud, not that far gone yet) about wheter Fate and Free Will can both exsist. I actualy thought up a comparison to it. I compaired teather ball to Fate and Free Will exsisting in the same place at the same time. Now Fate, is the steel poll jabbing into the ground unmoving, Free Will is represented by rope, moving and free. Now you are the Ball. The two players represent the choices in life. No matter how the game goes, eventually you will collide with that poll, its inevitable. So is there really any Free Will at all if no matter what you do you collide with the poll? Anyways thats enough out of me. Sweet dreams, don't let the bed bugs paralyze.  I'm afraid of what I'll do to myself one day...

						   Oh what to say... well I dunno what to post really. I'm getting kinda busy over here now in my life. Tonight I made a wrist band for myself out of leather and silver thread, I want to put  the word 'Lost' in the silver thread as well. I might wear my collar/choker thing I made but haven't worn yet, it doesn't fit as snug as I wanted it to but I'll try it. I've always wanted to play an instrument, so sometime in the next few weeks I'm getting a banjo, its going to cost alot of money but I want something like that, that I might be able to show my kids someday. Not that I'll ever have them. I'm going to die one of those lonely pathetic men, surrounded by people but so alone. Thats how I feel. I have lots of friends, more then I even realized, and beyond that I have aquantinces. But out of all those people, not one of them can give me what I need. They all see me as I am. Its so hard on me to hear everyone I've cared about say "You'll find someone, just not me." and then have my friends say "Don't worry, you'll find someone." Well I'm begining to think I wont, I actually know I wont but I keep hoping. I'm talking to this one girl, I always see her alone, and I knew her from public school. And I always tried to say hi when we passed in the hallways. That was a few months ago, now I talk to her and walk her from class to her locker. I kind of like her, but I don't think I'll try for more then anything but friends. My heart is so broken. Well I'm off for now, no more self pity. Got that out for you all to see, heart is clean and cracked.   Don't forget me, sweet dreams.

						     Your wings are  BROKEN  and tattered. You are an angelic spirit who has fallen from grace for one reason or another - possibly, you made one tragic mistake that cost you everything. Or maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't commit. In any case, you are faithless and joyless. You find no happiness, love, or acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most days are a burden and you wonder when the hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching picture. You are the one that few understand. Those that do know you are likely to love you deeply and wish that they could do something to ease your pain. You are constantly living in memories of better times and a better world. You are hard on yourself and self-critical or self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved, you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite your tainted nature, your soul is breathtakingly beautiful.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    ~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~    This was a very odd quiz for me to take... I answered everything as best I could and my wings are broken... My old name on MSN chat was Knight of the BrokenWing. I honestly felt my wings broken. They have been ever since, that was nearly 2 or 3 years ago. I've grown accustomed to them being broken, I forgot about them until just now, they don't throb like they used to. They're just dead... Well I'll probably write something more meaningfull after this, but until then. Adieu.  ~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~

						   *stretches his arms behind his head* I'm so tired right now, its about 12:45am and I slept for about 3 hours earlier tonight and am still tired. Oh well, sleep is for the weak... just like socks, pants, underware, and shoes (memories of a summer long past). I still feel lost, I'm unsure what to do. I'd really like to make something of myself, I should start on my book again I will have something concrete to hold and say "I made this, I'm proud." But I don't know if I have the willpower or creativity left inside of me. I need to take a weekend and do that, just write.   On a lighter note I've got a part-part-part time summer job. I'm going to be working for a guy at his cottage, raking leaves, trimming bushes and branches and mowing his lawn. Light yard work. But, this could end up becoming a bigger job if the other cottagers around his notice my work and like it. Well, hopeful thoughts and wishful thinking.  Have you ever noticed how laughing and crying are so close together? They are nearly the same thing... you can't control it... it happens when you don't want it to... they both happen on opposite extremes of the scale... I dunno.. just... felt like mentioning that.  I hit myself in the chest a few nights ago. I've been feeling very, very numb for a long time and I wanted to feel something... so I paced about my room, pounding and slamming my fist into my chest... I didn't bruise, it was barely even tender over the next days... it did help a little though... but I'm still numb... I wish I could get something out of me.... I feel like my body is full of some venom... pressing against my skin and numbing my insides... if I could leak the venom out I could feel again... but I don't know how too... What to do what to do.  Please don't leave me alone, that knife looks more tempting every night...

						   Oh what to say and what to do.  I'm totally unsure of myself right now. I have no clue who I am or what I want to do anymore. I feel so muddled and confused. Its almost like I'm watching my reflection in a pool of calm water and then it starts to rain, the droplets of rain distorting and rippling the me inside the water. I feel like I've gained something but lost something else. I gave up one part of myself to fill up a hole in another part. I haven't written anything in awhile other then this blog. I guess the only creativity in my life is what I pump out in here, little spurts of poorly written poetry and the thoughts that are on my mind.  Well, I believe its finally time for... The Fourth (and last) Question of Conscience   "Do you want to walk along? Or walk ahead? Or walk by yourself? One must know what one wants and that one wants."   Fourth question of conscience.  Friedrich Nietzsche   I want to walk by myself. I need to be by myself, I need some time to understand myself, I need to... I just need to walk. But where does one get the time to walk? In this time one must always have an agenda, a list, a goal, we must always know what to do next, and we have to plan ahead. But, in all this planning and efficient use of space, where does time for just ourselves go? Where can we find the time to do what we want without having to worry about being late for work, or school, or worry that will miss a phone call. What happened to all the time I'm supposed to have?  Alone and Confused,  Beaten and Bruised, Lost in the Blood Works.

						   The sun was setting and I was high up on a hill. I was looking out over the barren trees in front of me... still sleepy with winter. And I saw a shadow blocking out on of the beams of light. It was me. I realized that no matter how small you are you can still make a difference, as little as I was, I reached out and touched the ground a hundred feet away. But... as I was walking down the hill I slipped and fell flat on my ass. Lesson learned: Don't look to far ahead, you'll always fall on your ass.  buh-bye

						   http://www.drmenlo.com/pss/2003_10_05_archive.html  This is a blog I found when I went to log in to my account earlier tonight called Peep Show Stories. I thought it would be an interesting read, and it was... in more ways then one. The above link is to a story I found very... I don't know what I found it... all I know is that it touched me... The other stories on this site are that of a girl who works in the peep show industry, she relates stories of customers and what not... but this... this story was far from my mind when I read it. Touching... I don't know what else to say...

						   Heres a question you can ask anyone... it isn't a question of conscience...but it is a way to find out something that might not be something you want to hear...

						    Never Miss   Arrows flying swift and true Aimed unwillingly for your heart Deadly straight on winds of truth  They will never miss there mark The words I speak never fail No matter how I try Blood and love leaks readily From the wounds that I inflict Yet still I pull that bowstring taught My eyes closed tight Praying this won't be the killing shot But now I cry and curse For the truth I inflicted upon your heart Has brought you to a bloodied end Upon the winds of truth            By: Seth G. Smith    I have no clue where this came from really... I was laying in bed at about 3:30am when I sat upright... I knew I had to write this... I'd been thinking about something I'd said in a conversation earlier tonight so I guess I do have a clue where it came from... I guess this poem is just to show that the truth is more painful then any lie you can make up...  Goodnight and fairwell...

						   "What do I say?"  "I don't know"  "Where do I go?"  "I don't know"  "How did I get here?"  "I don't know"  "Who am I?" "I don't know" "What do I do?"  "I don't know... but keep on going."   Welcome and hello, weary readers. Its about 12:50 am, I'm sitting in my room again, wondering what to do. I used to have a set of goals, but now I am unsure of what to do. I wanted to become a chemist, but I don't know if I want to do that. I want to become a writer, but I don't know if I could do that.  I'm reverting back to the dumb ass I was in grade 9-10 and most off 11. I had no goals then and now I have no goals now. I want to become me, but who is me? How do I get there? too many questions... speaking of questions I think its time for the Third Question of Conscience....  "Are you one who looks on? Or one who lends a hand? Or one who looks away and walks off?"  -Third question of conscience.  Friedrich Nietzsche   I am all three... I sway from side to side. I watch in silence, I offer a hand, and sometimes I just walk away from it all... I wish I were more defined but I'm not, I guess I've got a bit of everything. But I only want a pinch of something...I want to be me, but what if me is everything else? Or is it just that everything else is me? That sounds self-centred but its a fair question, nevertheless.   Who reads this?... Who out there in this vast and intrict web of words and numbers and endless images and sounds, who has time for me? I'd like to ask whoever reads this post...to e-mail me and tell me what you think, or even just something saying that you read it once. Anything, let me know if anyone has time anymore. Put "BLOG" in the header of the e-mail, so I don't delete it.  I am ace_of_holes@hotmail.com  Please don't tell me I really am alone...

						   Oh woe as me.  I got caught the other day at school with some 'drug pariphinallia' when they brought the drug dogs in, the smelled some empty bags I had and I got caught. I'm not really a regular smoker, I just kept some stuff in my backpack incase I went to a friends house, probably not the best idea I've ever had, but I've just been having alot of bad luck lately. I'm hoping things are going to look up sooner then later, I've been feeling alright lately, i wouldn't say sad but definatly not happy. I'm floating in a place between both of them and every now and then I fall completly into the sad or drift momentarily into the happy. Not sure what to do with my life, but I'm tired of the hurt.

						   Just a few more quotes tonight, nothing much to say other then Van Hellsing is a great movie, just try not to think to hard about it or you'll end up devouring your mind.  "There is an appetite and therefore a market for anything and everything. Your darkest thought is not unique. The worst you can possibly imagine, no matter how bad, there is a market for it...." -  The Poet - Michael Connelly  Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionatly, in love with suffering. - Unknown  Just a few little quotes I liked, especially the first one. The second one is very true but doesn't seem to grip as much as the first. I've never been to go at analyzing things, but these two quotes both hold truth.  I'm alone, but hanging on.

I'm cursing and screaming,  I'm whining and beating at the walls of my mind. I'm sitting here smiling, but inside I'm dying silently crying.     By: Seth G. Smith  Another of my random poems, that aren't really random.

						   I should go to bed but I don't want to. I'm sick. I'm tired. I'm lonely. Life sure does seem to blow. It seems all I can do is push things away. This probalby wont make much sense to me tommorow because of how fucked up I am, being sick and tired and then not sleeping isn't a good idea.  If theres anyone out there who gives a damn, anyone whos been reading this, anyone who might understand. E-mail me or add me. Ace_Of_Holes@hotmail.com ... I need something, something new, something old, something to help and I can't find it. I don't even know what I'm saying but I'm serious... mail me...if theres anyone out there...  Going to bed before I do something stupid...

						   These are just a bunch of quotes I made up in my head in a few days, just for the hell of it. Some you might have heard somewhere else because I know they sound famillier to me, I'm not sure if its an old memory of it it just makes so much sense to me that it feels like I've known it forever. SGS is me, and other quotes have the authors name too.  Things are never set in stone for the man who holds the chisel.    -SGS  Everybody Uses Everybody.    -SGS  I'm dreaming to fast.    -SGS  Theres some comfort in knowing that you can't fall any further.    -SGS  Out of space, Out of time    - Edgar Allen Poe, Dreamland

						   I'm so tired right now... The weekends been alright so far. I went over to a friends house, set off about 80 bucks work of fireworks for a bunch of drunk and stoned people, that was neat. Got my pyro on and burned nearly anything that was burnable at the fire pit. Then, I got to go to sleep in my tent all alone with about a litre of water soaking into the foot of my sleeping bag. That was just magical. The next morning I was cleaning up some stuff, went down to my friends pond to wash something and slipped in the clay at the edge of the pond. It was a slow fall, only one foot went, so I looked over my shoulder to see where I could fall rather then take a swim in the pond, so I kicked back with my good foot and landed on nothing. But with the angle of my head, I put a huge kink in it. Now I can't turn my head to the left. Whoopie. Tonight I was going to head off to another party, but as soon as I stood up to go get ready it hit me of how sick I was. So when my friends came to my house I tossed them $5 for gas money and sent them off to the party. Now I'm sitting here with my head tilting to the right, no shirt on, sick, hot and cold, sweating, and depressed as all hell. I really wish I could just get rid of whatevers wrong with me. I'm tired of my shitty love life, I'm tired of being me. I like who I am, but it doesn't help me at all... I'm kind of like a old favorite shirt, comfy to wear, but not something thats good to bring around others. I feel like I've been talking to myself lately, I don't even expect responses from people anymore.  I think I might go see Shrek 2 tommorow, maybe ask a friend to go or something but I doubt she'd be able to make it in. Maybe I wont even bother asking and just not go at all... I don't know, I should probably try to ask, it'll probably seem to her like I'm asking her on a date but its just as friends even though I wouldn't mind it if it were a date... I told you I've been talking to myself lately...  I hate being me.

						   Evening, its about 10pm and I feel different. I think with the passing of winter into spring, which is quickly growing into summer has opened me up a bit. I can feel again... for about the last... oh I don't know... year I've been feeling pretty numb inside. I can feel now though, but its not the best feelings. My heart is full of confusion and my mind is so sick of things I feel like i'm emotionally going to throw up. I'm tired of the same shit happening to me over and over again, I'm confused cause I feel theres so many things wrong with me but I can't figure them out. Although I do know that I have a tendicy to make crude and stupid comments at inapropriate times. But I guess thats part of me. Well I'm off for now... Sweet dreams to you all.  It seems a prick of the knife also helped me feel better... just remembered something that happened a few weeks ago. Oh well, off for now.

						   I don't want to grow old. I look around and I see all these things changing around me, I'm not ready for change. I know that in the future I will loose touch with all that I hold dear to me now, it will move away from me or I will shift from it. I don't want to loose contact with this  generation, this age. I know that you can argue that the people I feel close with now  will age and change with me, but I know that it wont be the same. I haven't really changed all that much in the last 4 years. I'm the same person, I don't change. I wish I could sometimes, but I just don't. So all this will leave me one day, or I will leave  it. Its hard to believe that in a few years I will be moving out, going to the real world, paying my own bills and going to university. I'm not ready for that. Thats just one step closer to becoming even more lost and set in my ways. I want to use the time I have now, but I don't know how. I don't want to age but it will happen... Theres a reason why that knife looks tempting...I know its vain but... I'd rather have someone remember me as the person I am now, rather then the shriveled up, empty shell of a man I will become in 20 or 30 years. I want to be known for me now, not who I'll be molded into.  I don't know what to do. So I'll keep going, for now.

						   Oh what to say... I'm quite tired right now, I just finished running 4 laps, having a shower, shaving (but where? muwhahaha), and having a generally downing day. Things are going alright it seems, I'm busy in all of my classes, not a good thing, and I've got alot of personal projects on the go. I just finished making a pipe for my grandfather, made myself a 'pimping' cane, now I'm working on another cane thats going to be able to hold some liquid in it.   Everyones been asking me if I'm going to prom, which is begining to become a real depresser. I'd like to go, but unfortunatly, I have no money, and no date. And even if I did go by myself, I'd just be a third wheel because the people who want me to come have dates. Oh well, shit happens.  Lets see...Well lately I've felt like I bring the worst luck with me. Three friends of mine I've talked to in the span of about 4 days had either a) there boyfriend dump them, or b) had a major fight with the good possiblity of a break up. You know its bad when your own poor luck spills out into the streets and others begin to slip on it.   I'm still lonely as all hell. Not really to depressed about it, but that will probably change in a few days when I hit a low again. Every girl I like seems to look to a friend of mine and like them rather then me, I guess I'm just no good at expressing myself. Well, I don't even know what to express anymore. I'm so unsure of my emotions and what to do about them, I don't even know what they mean anymore.  I want a religion. I was reading through my Book of Shadows which I haven't written in in over a year. I really want to believe, Witchcraft is the only thing I feel I can believe in, actually truely believe in. But its so hard, all I do is pick at things in my mind until all the seams are gone and a pile of useless fabric and dreams lays on the floor in front of me. Witchcraft is something I want to learn, something I want to be. But with the speed of things right now, I don't know if I can. With how I think, I don't know if I can... but I'm going to try... I'm going to keep reading... try to keep believing... maybe one day I'll be able to take my pentagram off of my bed post and wear it again as I believe...I need this...  Goodnight to all  The knife ever gleams in the night, ready for me... but I sleep with both eyes open.

						   Just an update on my life I suppose... Well, I spent the most part of the afternoon running around town dropping of resumes. Wal-Mart, Idenpendent Grocers, Bulk Barn, Canadian Tire, and Little Cesars. I'm betting not one of them is going to call me back, but I think I might try calling them back for once. I'm feeling pretty down and lonely, but I'm trying to stay up, to keep going. Tommorow I'm going to go out and work on the paintball feild if its not raining, and if it is I might go out into the shop to make myself a new pipe. Summer is looking iffy right now, I'm not sure how its all going to turn out. Hopefully I get out more and hang with friends. But I'm off for now. No quotes or fancy poems this time, no suicidal thoughts. I'm to on the fence for any of that.

						   Evening everyone, I know its been a long time since my last post, but I've been busy with school and personal things going on. Well its officially summer, the last day of school ended 31 minutes ago and I am now free of the bindings of a school schedule. Life has been alright, had some hurt given to me from someone online but I'm recovering. Theres a girl I'm talking to(I prefer not to use names) now from school, I'm starting to like her but I don't know if she likes me back. Shes a great girl, and I've only really known her for a short while. Shes a good friend, so I'm not sure what i'm going to do, tell her or don't tell her. I'm not sure.  Well, my last exam was on the monday and I ended up writing two essays. One for a short story called "The Yellow Wallpaper", and another about how literature provides catharsis for some. I'm not sure how I did on them... but I copied a few exerpts from the essay on catharsis to keep:  "...Neitchze said "Once you label me, you negate me." Fate may assign us a role, but it is up to ourselves to discover that role and label ourselves. So that we may understand our purpose and not just be another automaton that believes what others say they are...."     This one is based on the novel "Fifth Business", I just felt that I could believe in fate more if it was something that didn't totaly govern our lives, that it was more of a hidden piece of ourselves that we had to realize in order to be happy or to find our 'place' in life.  "...I've come to realize that what we believe and how we interpret things is based on our fears and our hopeps. Our beliefs are based on what we want to believe more then the actual facts. We mould things to what we want to, need to, believe...."     This is in relation to the novel "The Poet" by Michael Connelly (READ IT!), its just something I've always kind of felt but never put into words. We really only notice the facts that apply to us, or can be twisted to our needs.  Well thats all for now folks, hopefully I'll be posting more often now.

						   Headlong into the breach...  I'm tired of just standing by, I'm tired of being the one who has to wait, I'm breaking out. I've found a hole and I'm running through it and I don't know if I'll stop. I see a crack in the wall finally and I'm trying to squeeze through, I might get stuck, or have to go back, but until I can't go any further I'm going to keep pushing. Headlong into the breach...

						   "Its the thought that counts."  Thats probably one of humanities biggest lies, the thought is nothing. All the thoughts in the world add up to nothing when compaired to one single action. Thoughts lead way to actions, to things, but a thought is intangible and that is worthless. Nothing in this world is worth holding onto unless you can see it, feel it, smell it, hear it, even taste it. Nothing I can give will ever be enough because all I am is a bundle of thoughts I keep inside, even when I finally let those thoughts out they are meaningless. I used to believe it was the thought that counts, but one person taught me otherwise.

						   Cause all of the stars have faded away Just try not to worry you'll see them someday Just take what you need and be on your way And stop crying your heart out... (Stop Crying Your Heart Out - Oasis)  The other night I was at a party, I was surrounded by people but I was alone at the same time. So I decided to go and lay down on the floating dock at the pond, nearby the bon fire. I sat there and stared up at the clouds, listening to the hum of conversations all around, from the bonfire, trailing all the way around the edge of the pond. I felt very alone sitting there, no one really caring to talk to me, people would stop by and say hi then wander off without taking the time to talk, or even just sit by me. So I lay there for a long time... trying to contemplate the stars, knowing that they were more then just pin pricks of light in a black canvas, that somewhere out there in that imeasurable sky someone or something might be laying and looking back towards me, towards this tiny planet that I'm barely apart of, this island that I live on with so many but so alone. So many people hope that somewhere, someone, is looking out into the stars with them, but no one was looking at the stars with me that night so I hoped, imagined, dreamed, that someone was looking back at me. In such vastness I'm so small, does it really matter that I was alone that night, that no one really cared for more then a few brief moments about my miniscule feelings. In all of space I am just one mere spec, but even the tiniest piece of nothing is something. But that night I felt my stars fading even as I watched them. Tonight another star will blink out and I will miss it, even if I don't know it. Maybe I need to find a new sky, new stars, or maybe I should just let myself burn out with these stars I've known all my life.  Alone In Thought  Alone in thought I sit and ponder What if's and Why not's As the night drags on Alone in thought I sit and wonder Dreaming and missing As fools pray Alone in thought I sit and sigh As I think that someday that I wont be missing Alone in thought  I sit and cry As my stars fade away  ~Seth G. Smith

						   Its been awhile since I've posted anything. My lifes been going ok, it hasn't been too good or too bad, nothing to look forward to and nothing to dread. Just going through the motions. Went to a party the other night and ended up bouncing, that was alright. I miss being my old self, lately I've felt differently, guess its cause I'm just neutral compaired to being depressed or happy. I've got no inspiration right now, I don't have anything right now really but I'm just neutral about it all... well I'm off for now, started depressing myself with that little bit, maybe something will happen.

						   The days between my posts seem to stretch on and on. Like stretching a piece of gum, it keeps getting longer between the ends.  Well I guess I'll just update on my life. I FINALLY got a job, I'm working at a pizza place called Little Ceasers, I don't know how much there paying me yet but the people there are really nice so far, no ones mean or insulting or anything like that. So I'm happy about that for now. Its tiring though.  I've been doing alot of work for my aunt and uncle, clearing out some brush so they can have a bigger lawn. Its not so bad, but I've been getting a farmers tan. The only type of tan I ever get. I'm trying to finish up this game I made up called Thriller, its a pencil and paper game like Dungeons and Dragons but simpler, I like it.  Theres a really big party happening at my friends house this weekend, I've got to get ahold of some booze for that event. I'm hoping I might meet someone there, no one in paticular, just someone new or someone old, either way it'll be good for me I think.  Not to much to complain about right now except my new glasses, giving me a major headache. I'm in a fairly meh mood, I'm not happy about anything yet I'm not really depressed either, I could go to either side of the fence right now, not a good place to be, on the fence. Well, thats all I'm putting for now, enjoy.

						   The night she truly had my heart; the night I gave her everything I had to give; the night I truly belonged to her and only her; the night I would have let the world collapse if I could just hold her was the night that the love in her heart for me faded away...  ...she knows who she is without a doubt who she is... and she knows how sorry I really am... tonight I cry for her like I never could before...

						   Its been so long since I last walked these halls, but I haven't forgotten this little place where my thoughts slumber...  Not to much to update on life really, the girl I was likeing doesn't like me back (big surprise) but were still going to be friends, and I still want to be friends. Well other then that not much has happened in, lit my friends forest on fire (it was just a little one), drank 7 shots of tequila and had my friends gf throw up in my toilet. Good times, I hope I get to go to more parties soon, don't want to waste the summer sitting on my ass.  Well I'm alone now... and it isn't all that bad...

						   I am forever loving from the other side of the window pane...  It feels like I'm always seperated from what I love by something as thin as a sheet of glass or from a distance as infinite as what lays behind my monitor. The things I love are always just out of reach, I can see them but never touch them. Always hoping to walk around the barrier to reach them... to show them how I feel. To pass through the glass and to let them see the love in my eyes and feel the warmth of my heart, to let them know that they are beautiful beyond anything I've ever imagined, in my most secret dreams or in my most fantastical dreams in day. To just touch her once I'd complete the most complicated task any man, women, creature, goddess or god could ever devise... just to be free of the glass... my little glass prison...

						   A Boat Beneath A Sunny Sky  A boat, beneath a sunny sky Lingering onward dreamily In an evening of July -  CHildren three that nestle near, Eager eye and willing ear, Please a simple tale to hear -  Long as paled that sunny sky: Echoes fade and memories die: Autumn frosts have slain July.  Still she haunts me, phantomwise, ALice moving under skies Never seen by waking eyes.  Children yet, the tale to hear, Eager eye and willing eye, Lovingly shall nestle near.  In a Wonderland they lie, Dreaming as the days go by, Dreaming as the summers die:  Ever drifting down the stream - Lingering in the golden gleam - Life, what is it but a dream?    Lewis Carroll - 'Through the Looking Glass'  I just finished reading 'Through the Looking Glass' by Lewis Carroll. What an interesting ending, I think the second tale of Alice has much more meaning then the first, or at least its easier for me to relate to. I once pondered wether I was the dream or the dreamer... I still wonder sometimes, always wondering if all this is just the minute dream of some sleeping being, that when I die it awakens to a new day of its life. Can the dream dream? When I fall asleep I dream, do I create a figment much like myself that dies upon my own awakening? What if my dream were to dream? If my dreamer were to die while I dreamt, would the dreams reaching on for infitity simply blink out or would they continue to live on? For I would never awaken again, the deep sleep of death. If I perish do my dreams live on? So many questions of such apparent uselessness.  On a different note I'm a very depressed person, no matter how good things seem to be going I can't stay happy. One dear friend, one girl seems to have the power to make me smile lately, she means alot to me. I really don't know where I would be without her right now, I wish I could do more for her. I wish I could be more. Sweet dreams.

						   "Why is a raven like a writing Desk?"  Alice runs through my mind and the writing style of Lewis Carroll echos in my thoughts. I've been reading "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking Glass". For the last hour since I put the book down, only half way through the looking glass (note the joke?), and I can't stop thinking in a rhyming nonsense sort of way. Its very confusing yet amusing. See!? I didn't even mean to do that. I'm working alot more, hoping to throw my own party sometime soon, maybe that way people will talk to me a bit. I'm hoping to try something new at this party, partially related to the Alice in Wonderland stuff I've been reading. I'll write about it when the time comes. And I know I finally found a few answers to the riddle in wonderland, but I can't tell you all, you need to look and find one for yourself, or just make one up. Goodnight, I'm out...
