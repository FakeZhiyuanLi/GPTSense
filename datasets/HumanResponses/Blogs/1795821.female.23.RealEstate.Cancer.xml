      (note:  This was originally published on my old website  urlLink "Weezer and Stuff" )  Scott's Side Project  a fanfic by Becca       "Brian has a side project.  Pat has a side project.  Why can't I have a side project? It's not fair!," Scott said to himself, thinking about how Rivers was about side projects.  He remembered times where Brian would talk about the Space Twins and then get yelled at by Rivers.  Pat knew enough not to talk about it very much in the first place.       Weezer was taking a break for a while.  Pat was doing stuff with The Special Goodness.  Brian was doing stuff with the Space Twins.  Rivers was busy hanging out with Fred, Britney, and other celebrities so people would see him on TV or at least inside a tabloid.  Scott was bored out of his mind.  True, cruising around Silverlake in his El Camino was fun, but he missed playing his bass.       Just then there was a knock at the door of Scott's apartment.  It was Brian.  "Hey, Scott!  How are you doing today?," he asked gleefully.       "Hmmm... bored... but fine... I guess...," Scott replied.       "Well I came over to invite you to a performance of my band, the Space Twins.  Would you like to come?  We will be playing tonight at the Troubador," Brian said eloquently.       "Sure.  Why not?," Scott said, even though it was just another reminder of what he could be doing.       Later that night, Scott observed Brian's performance in a hidden away spot in the bar, away from the screaming girls who were always trying to pet Brian.  He was hoping they wouldn't notice him.  They were only there because he was in Weezer and could care less about the Space Twins.   "Hmm... I guess that is a downside to having a side project.  Some people will only like you for your main band, but I can handle that," he said to himself.       He looked around the bar.  Rivers was there, hidden away himself, talking on his cell phone.  "Oh Mary Kate, Ashley, the three of us can have our birthday parties together... Yeah, I'll still take you to the mall afterward...," Rivers was saying into the phone.  Scott just sighed and rolled his eyes.       At that point, Scott's cell phone rang as well.  "Hey, what's goin' on, man?  You at Brian's gig?," Pat asked.       "Yeah.  What you up to?," Scott asked back.       "Oh nothing much, just on the road with the Foo Fighters...  How's Brian doing up there?"       "Pretty good," Scott said.       "That's cool.  Gotta go now.  Dave and I are going to have a drum off.  Later!," Pat said before hanging up.       Scott was sad, thinking about what Pat was doing.  He could be there, too, if he had only said yes when Pat offered him Murph's old spot.       He sat in his apartment, thinking about the day Rivers tore into Brian for even mentioning the Space Twins in an interview and things Rivers had periodically said to him about side bands, often accompanied by a slashing motion across the throat or a mid-90's picture of the band with Matt ripped out of it.  Even Rivers' voice haunted him, saying "You know what happens to bassists who start their own band..."  It echoed in his brain before he went to bed.       Scott fell into a vivid dream as he fell asleep.  He found himself in an endless room full of basses.  He then heard a voice saying, "Hey! Over here!"  It was a voice he had heard before.  Scott turned toward the voice.  There was Matt Sharp sitting on a sofa fooling around with his bass.  The funny thing was that he didn't look like Matt today.  He looked like Matt from 1995, with his hair cut short.         "What are you doing here?," Scott asked with bewilderment.       "I'm the ghost of Matt Sharp and I've come to talk to you about side projects.  Here, take a seat," he said gesturing to a chair.       Scott sat down and thought for a minute.  "Wait a minute," he said, "Matt is still alive! How can you be his ghost?"       Matt's ghost thought for a minute. "Hmmm... that's a good point.  I never thought about that before...  Let's see...," the ghost said, scratching his head.  "Oh! I've got it!  I am the ghost of Matt Sharp from WEEZER.  I'm pretty sure that part of him is dead.  Is that a good explanation for you?"       "Yeah.  I guess that explains it...," Scott replied, still confused.       "Good, but we have no time to discuss that.  I hear you've been thinking about a side project of your very own.  Just to clarify, the Rentals were never a side project, they were MY BAND!," ghost Matt said.       "Yeah, yeah. I know...," Scott said.       "Sorry. I am very sensitive about that.  Anyway, I'm sure Rivers has put you through every scare tactic in the book.  Don't let him sway you.  If you want a band of your very own, then do it!"       "What???," Scott said.       "You heard me," the ghost of Weezer Matt replied.  "If you truly want to start your own band, who can stop you?  Only you can stop yourself.  Rivers doesn't control your life.  Besides, you look like you could kick his ass if he ever started shit with you anyway.  You're a scary guy."       "Ummm... thanks I guess... but, you know, I only look like a scary brute.  Inside I am very sensitive."       "Aren't we all...?  Most guys, however, would never admit it."       "So what are you up to these days?," Scott asked.       "Well, you probably already know the real deal is out on the road with his solo act.  I've been really bored lately because of that."       "Why is that?"       "Well all these kids who only see the real me because I was in Weezer go out to the shows and heckle me.  They remind the real Matt of times he was acting like an idiot, usually drunk off his ass.  Or would that be my ass?  Anyway, when kids ask him about Weezer and such it does the haunting for me."       "That sucks," Scott said.       "Well, anyway, do what you really want to do.  Good luck," Matt's Weezer ghost said as the dream world faded out.       The next day, Scott began to plan his big side project.  "Okay, I will have to work on making my voice super scary.  I might even want the guitarist I hire to have a scary voice too for added effect.  Oh man, we have to be totally heavy metal.  I never get to rock out to my fullest with Weezer."  He even made posters to put around the area:  BRAND NEW HEAVY METAL BAND  LOOKING FOR HARDCORE DRUMMER  AND GUITARIST WITH SCARY VOICE.  SCARY LOOK A PLUS.  MISSION: TO BRING THE ROCK BACK TO THE KIDDIES!  CALL 555-0711 FOR AUDITION.       Plenty called to audition with Scott over the next week.  He finally settled on two heavily pierced and tattooed guys who were also very talented.  The guitarist went by the name "Murder" and the drummer was named Steve.  Scott, Steve, and Murder decided to name their band Thicker than Blood and immediately started practicing songs Scott had written during his time of boredom.       Eventually, the band got out there and began playing gigs and such.  They even began to lay down tracks for an album.  Scott's band built up a small following and the potential for success grew larger by the day.  Unfortunately, the amount of time Scott had off from Weezer also grew shorter by the day.       Soon, the dreaded day had arrived.  Scott received a phone call from Rivers.  "Hey Scott," Rivers said, "I think I've had enough time off.  Let's get back to the studio tomorrow so we can start on album 5.  After that, we can go back to some heavy duty touring.  I know you've been really bored, so I bet you can't wait..."       "Umm... yeah... sure... that will be great!," Scott said nervously.       "I thought you'd be more excited," Rivers said.       "No, it's just that i've gotten used to having all this free time.  It will just be a while before I get back into the groove of doing all the heavy duty Weez work again," Scott said, still nervous.       "Well be at the studio tomorrow at 10 a.m.  No later!," Rivers said sternly.       Scott didn't know what to do.  His band was ready to break beyond underground, but now he was being dragged back into his Weezer world.  He always said that Weezer would be his top priority, but now Scott wasn't so sure.  He was enjoying his life in a side project, but, alas, it was only a side project.  He had to tell the other guys that they might not be doing any more work for a while.       Scott, Steve, and Murder had a meeting a few days later.  "Listen, guys," Scott said, "I'm in another band.  I started this one as a side project to kill boredom while we had all this time off in my other band, but now they want to get together and start working again.  That means that we can't do anything for a while.  I hope you understand."       "Just curious," Steve said, "but what other band are you in?"       "Weezer.  Didn't you guys know that?," Scott replied.       Steve began uncontrollably laughing.  "Weezer?  You're shitting me, right?  Weezer! Ha! What a funny joke!  What band are you really in, Scott?"       "I told you Steve.  Weezer," Scott said.       Steve continued to laugh.  "Weezer is a geek band.  You're not a geek, are you?"       "I'm there to take some of the geekiness away from the band.  Do you have a problem with that?  If so, you can leave this band," Scott said with anger bubbling within him.       "I don't want to be in a band with any geeks," Steve said, walking out the door.       "What about you, Murder?," Scott asked.       Murder was silent as usual for a minute, but then he spoke up.  "I understand.  I have to go back to my band as well."       The only time anyone really heard Murder's voice was when he was screaming into the microphone.  Murder almost never spoke in conversation, but when Scott heard him speak, his voice sounded familiar.  "Rivers? Is that you?," Scott asked, "What are you doing here?"       Murder removed his wig of long, black hair and took off his clip-on piercings.  "Yeah.  It's me," he said, "I just wanted to rock out.  Besides, I thought I told you never to start a side project."  Scott, out of patience at that point, was about ready to pound him, but then Rivers said, "I'm just fucking with you.  Relax.  I'll let you have this side band as long as you tell no one about my alter ego."       "Man, I still can't believe you're Murder.  Are those tatoos for real?," Scott asked.       "No.  They rub right off.  See?," Rivers said rubbing his arm.  "Do we have a deal, Scott?  Can I secretly be a metal god and you have a side band."       "Okay," Scott replied, "but on one condition.  You remember that this is MY band.  Don't you dare try to take over.  I'll let you do whatever the hell you want with Weezer as long as you let me do whatever the hell I want with this band."       Rivers thought for a moment.  "Deal," he said, shaking Scott's hand.       Later on, the band found a new drummer who was even more hardcore than the first.  His name was Joe and he had no qualms about Weezer or the fact that this band was just a side project.  In fact, Joe had a job of his own, so it worked out better that way for him.       The band never really did get that successful, nor did they last very long.  Joe wanted to spend more time with his family, Scott got bored with the whole thing, and Murder went on to become the newest guitarist for Limp Bizkit.  THE END

      (note: This was originally published on my old website  urlLink "Weezer and Stuff" )  Adventures with Mikey  Episode 2:  Worship Me Like An Idol       "Dammit, we're out of milk!," Brian shouted.  He was already having a bad morning.  The water in the shower was cold, his favorite shirt needed to be washed and pressed, and now there was no milk for his cornflakes.       "Oh yeah," Mikey said, "I used it up last night when I made my giant bowl of chocolate pudding."       "WHAT??," Brian said, "You used up all the milk on PUDDING??? I just bought milk the other day!"       "Sorry," Mikey replied, paying more attention to his video game than Brian.       "You didn't even write it down on the grocery list!," Brian yelled.       "So...?," Mikey replied.       "Well, you're going to have to go out and buy some more milk," Brian said like a parent to a misbehaving child.       "Right now?," Mikey whined, "I'm on the verge of beating this game."       "Well that's why they made the save function," Brian said as Mikey mocked him while he wasn't looking.       Rivers walked in the room as the conversation unfolded.  "Hey Mikey, since you're going out, could you pick up some things for me, too?," he asked.       "Yeah, whatever," Mikey said getting up and heading out the door.       As Mikey headed down the street, he noticed this really hot girl standing in this really long line.  He decided to go up and talk to her.       "Hey, babe, what's going on here?," he asked her.       "Oh, like, I'm just, like, auditioning for, like, this show.  It's, like, called American Idol.  I, like, can't believe you, like, never heard of it," she said.       "Oh yeah, I've heard of it... yeah...," Mikey said, trying to think of what show she was talking about.       "I'm, like, going to be on, like, TV.  Like, ohmigod, I am, like, going to be famous," the girl continued.         The girl seemed quite dense, but Mikey didn't care.  SHE WAS HOT!!!  "Maybe I can bang her after her audition," he thought.  He continued listening to her useless chatter in hopes that he could at least get a telephone number out of her.       A long amount of time had passed.  Mikey had almost fallen asleep listening to the girl go on and on.  Eventually, they had reached the front of the line and some guy was yelling at him.       "HEY YOU!," the man said loudly, "GET YOUR ASS IN HERE IF YOU WANT TO AUDITION!!!"         Before Mikey could respond, the people behind him shoved him into the building.  He unwillingly filled out all kinds of forms and lied about his age, saying he was 25.  After doing so, he looked around for the girl he was talking to, but she was nowhere to be found.       Mikey was escorted into a room.  "What will you be performing?," a young woman asked him.       "Ummm..." Mikey was put on the spot.  He had no clue what to do.  "I will be performing 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' by Cyndi Lauper."  The girl gave Mikey a funny look and escorted him into another room and sarcastically wished him luck.       Mikey walked into the room. "OH MY GOD! It's Paula Abdul!," Mikey shouted.       "Thank you, sweetie, but would you sing for us?," Paula asked Mikey.       "Anything for you, Paula," Mikey said.  He broke out into his rendition of "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" as he started dancing around the room with sexual motions.  He gave Paula a sexy stare as he completed his routine.       "Yo! Yo Dawg!  That was interesting...  Dawg, maybe you should consider changing your repetoire 'cuz you're a Dawg, not a girl," said Randy.       "You're really cute," Paula said, "but I think you need to get a new song and practice a little bit more.  You have great potential, you took some risks, and you have this provocative streak that I like.  Come back next time with a little bit more practice and a song that better fits you and your personality."       "I love you Paula," Mikey said.       "I know," Paula replied.       "Well I know I never want to see you here ever again," Simon interrupted, "That was dreadful.  You are not fit to be an idol.  I've never seen anything more horrid in my life."       Mikey, with his feelings hurt, hung his head as he walked out the door.  Before he left, however, he had to say one more thing.  "Paula, can I have your number?," he asked.       "I don't think so," she said, as security men finally drug Mikey out of the building.       "Dammit," Mikey said as he walked down the street to the store, "I lost out against two babes today."  A couple months later...       "Yo, Yo Dawg!," Pat yelled as he ran into the house, jumped on the couch and turned on the TV.  "It's time for a new season of American Idol."       "Since when have you been interested in reality-based, talent show programming?," Brian asked.       "Since whenever," he replied.  "Besides, Randy cracks me up with all his 'dawg' speak.  I wonder what he sounds like when he's ordering a hot dog... Yo dawg! Give me a hot dog, dawg!"       Brian rolled his eyes but then reluctantly looked at the screen.  "Who is that?," Brian asked.       "Dude, that's Paula Abdul.  Remember her?  You know, 'Coldhearted Snake.'  Hot isn't she?," Scott said, entering the room and looking at the television.       "No," Brian said, "I'm talking about the contestant.  He looks an awful lot like --"       "-- Hey guys, what's up?," Mikey interrupted as he strolled in the room.       Brian did a double take, as did Pat and Scott.  "Mikey, is that you?," Brian asked.       Mikey looked at the television.  "Well, what do you know? It is me.  I didn't think they put the bad ones on TV...," he said.       "You met Paula Abdul," Scott said, "and you didn't tell me?"       "Dude, you're on TV!," Pat added, "Normally it's me that's always on TV.  Finally, I think the curse has been broken."       "We should be taping this," Scott said.       "Shhhhh...," Brian said, "I want to hear."       They all intently watched Mikey make a fool out of himself on national television.       "You picked 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun'?  You're such an idiot!  Surely, you could have picked something better to sing," Brian said.       "Man, you've got to be proud of yourself.  You invaded our television space.  Way to go!," Pat said.       "I can't believe it... You met Paula Abdul...," Scott said.       "I can't believe they didn't find you out," Brian said, "You're obviously overage for this escapade.  Not to mention, you were our bassist.  You'd think somebody would have recognized you..."       Mikey just shrugged.  "Hey stuff like that happens, I guess..."       "YOU met PAULA ABDUL," Scott said.       "Yes, Scott, I did.  She was fine, man," Mikey said.       "I've had enough of this," Brian said, "I'm going to my room."       "Yeah, that sounds like a good idea," Mikey added.  "Can I join you?," he asked winking at Brian.       "Ummm... okay..., but I'm just going to watch a DVD or something.  I suppose you can join me," Brian said hesitantly.       "Yay!," Mikey said, giving Brian a hug.       "You really can get off me," Brian said, dragging Mikey to his room.       "Wait!," Scott quickly turned around and yelled, "Mikey! Did you get Paula's number?"

      (note: this was originally published on my former website  urlLink "Weezer and Stuff" )  Adventures with Mikey  Episode 1:  Don't Go in the Closet  January 2002       It was about noon in the "Weezer-hood", as Pat so creatively called it.  Pat lived next door to the giant mansion where Rivers lived and kept Brian and Scott.  Karl also lived on the complex in the poolhouse for convenience, unlike the other band members who lived on the property because Rivers wanted to keep an eye on them.       Rivers rolled out of bed and shuffled groggily toward the kitchen.  There he saw Scott, in sweats, all messy and sweaty from his daily regiment of pumping iron.  Scott was making himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.       "Sandwiches time?," Rivers asked him.       "Yup," Scott Replied.       "Where's Brian?," Rivers asked, looking around the room.       Scott smirked.  "I've got 20 dollars saying that he will come out of the shower in about 15 minutes.  He's already been in there for two-and-a-half hours."       Rivers immediately snickered and then thought for a brief moment.  "I'm in!  I say Brian will take another hour."  Rivers then proceeded to pour himself a bowl of cereal.  As Rivers started to pour milk into the bowl, Brian finally exited the bathroom.       Brian whistled as he left the steamy bathroom.  As he walked down the hallway, he passed a full length mirror.  Brian stopped and then went back to the mirror.  He gazed at himself for a minute.  He played with his hair a little and then flashed himself a huge smile. "Hey, guys," he said, as he walked into the room.       Scott laughed.  "Pay up, bro," he said to Rivers.       Rivers responded with a laugh of his own.  "No way!  You said 15 minutes, not five."       "I was closer.  Pay up!"       "Shut up, biotch!  I'm not gonna pay you!"       After about a minute of fighting, Scott rolled his eyes and gave a deep sigh.  "Fine.  We'll call it a draw.  Fair enough?"       Brian looked puzzled.  He had no clue what just went on.  "Ummm... guys?  What's going on?"       Scott turned bright red.  "Oh.  Nothing," he said quietly.       "Oh...," Brian replied.  He maintained the look of bewilderment for a minute, but then his face changed back to a huge grin.  "I'm gonna do my laundry, guys,"  he said, walking back out of the room.       Just then, there was a knock at the door.  Scott answered the knocking.  It was Pat.       "Hey, Pat, what's going on?," asked Scott.       "Oh, not much.  My woman's making me do some chores, so I decided to sneak over here," Pat replied.       "Cool.  Make yourself at home.  I have to take a shower, though,"  Scott replied.       Pat eyed Scott over.  Scott was still all messy from his workout.  "Brian finally got out, eh?," he laughed.  "Trust me.  I don't mind.  By the looks of you, you need it."  Scott pretended to look offended for a minute, but then laughed and headed off for the bathroom.       Brian had entered the room during the conversation.  He looked baffled again.  "I got out of what?," Brian asked, in response to the comment Pat had made about Brian finally finishing his primming.       Pat paused for a minute, remembering that comment.  "Uhh...  nothing.  I'm going to play some video games, okay?"       "Okay!,"  Brian said, a huge smile returning to his face.       Brian continued his laundry, Pat began playing video games, Scott was in the shower, and Rivers was finishing his breakfast.  Just then, the phone rang.  Rivers, sitting near the phone, answered it.  "Hello?"       "Hey, it's me," Karl said on the other end, "Pat's wife just came over here looking for him.  Is he at your place?"       "Yeah..."       "Well, you'd better hide him, because she's coming over."       "Shit!"       "Good luck figuring out what to do.  Talk to you later!"       Rivers frantically hung up the phone as Brian walked through the kitchen, dusting off his hands.  Rivers grabbed him and frantically ran into the living room where Pat was playing video games.       "Okay, here's the deal.  Pat, you're wife is coming over, so we have to hide you somewhere.  Brian!  You must keep Pat's wife busy while we hide him.  You'll know when Pat's hidden when I meet up with you guys, got it?"       Brian smiled again.  "Okay!"       "Now, where are we going to hide you...?," Rivers muttered.       "How about under Scott's bed?," Pat suggested.       "No!  That's a stupid idea!"       "She's coming," Brian yelled from the other room.       "Here we go," Rivers said, "This closed over here should be perfect."  Rivers grabbed the doorknob.  "Shit!  The door is jammed.  It won't open"       Conveniently, Scott walked by, fresh out of the shower.  "Are you guys having trouble?  Here, let me get it."       Scott rammed himself into the door, and it opened.  All three looked in.  "OH MY GOD!!!!," they yelled upon seeing what had been trapped in the closet.       "What the hell is that?,"  Scott said.       "Holy Shit!,"  Pat said in utter amazement.       "So that's where he went!," Rivers added.       In a heap, Mikey was lying in the closet.  He was a complete mess.       "Is he dead?," Pat asked, "because I'm not hiding with a dead guy."       "Get in here or else you'll be dead, too," Rivers said, pushing him into the closet.       Pat looked around the dark closet.  "Man, it smells gross in here, but I suppose you wouldn't smell the best if you were trapped in a closet for several months.  I should take his pulse, but I'm afraid to touch him.  He is so nasty."       Just then, Mikey began to twich and groan.  He slowly opened his eyes.  "Duuuuuuuuude.  Pat?  How did you get in here, man?  Am I dead?"       "No, I'm hiding from my wife.  How on earth did you get here?"       "First tell me, how did you get in here?"       "Ummm... the door?"       "No, like, the door was locked."       "You locked yourself in here?"       "It was scary, man.  It feels like I've been trapped in here forever.  How long has it been, like three, four days?"       "Try more like four or five... MONTHS!!!!"       "Holy shit! That's a long time.  I could really go for a cigarette.  Do you have any on you?"       "I quit!  You knew that!"       Scott then opened the door, letting the two of them out.  "She's gone now, Pat."       "Who the hell are you?," Mikey asked, eyeing up Scott.       "I'm Scott.  When you disappeared, Rivers hired me to take your place.  It was a temporary thing until they eventually gave up looking for you."       "Well pack your bags, fucker, I'm back!"       "Excuse me?"       "You heard me!"       "Mikey," Pat interrupted, "why don't you take a shower and clean yourself up.  You look disgusting.  Rivers, Brian, and I will decide what to do."       "Yeah, so they can take me back," Mikey said with a smartass smile.       "Fuck you!," Scott yelled.       "Hey now," interrupted Pat, "Scott why don't you just chill out.  Mikey, TAKE A SHOWER!!!  Rivers, Brian, and I will discuss the situation later." Mikey stormed off to the bathroom and Scott stormed off to his room.       Later that evening, Rivers, Brian, and Pat gathered at Karl's place.  "Okay, so Mikey has returned.  What are we going to do?," Rivers said, starting the meeting.       "Go shopping!," Brian yelled with a cheesy grin.  Everybody shot Brian a dirty look.  He shrank back into his chair.  "Just... kidding... guys..."       "Well, we can't just get rid of Scott," Pat said, continuing the meeting.       "...but we can't just kick Mikey out on his ass either," Brian added.       "If you ask me," Pat continued, "Scott is a much better bassist."       "Scott is an awesome bassist, but Mikey was good, too, and he has nowhere to go.  I would feel bad if Mikey was left out in the cold," Brian said.       "...but Scott better fits the sound we have going on now," Pat argued back.       "Alright already!," Rivers yelled, sick of the fighting.  "Here's what we're going to do..."       The next morning, a meeting was called, this time with both Mikey and Scott present.  "Mikey.  Scott," Rivers said, commencing the meeting. "We have come to a decision."  Mikey and Scott looked at each other and then they both looked down at the floor.  Rivers continued, "Scott, for you, things will be the same as before.  You will still play bass for us."       "YEEEEESSSS!!!!," Scott yelled.       Mikey grew teary eyed and began to sniffle.  "What about me, Rivers?"       "You will live here, but you will help out around the house.  Since Scott is staying in your old cell... err... room, you will be living in Pat's old room.  Helping out around the house will include cleaning and other random tasks.  You'll do, basically, whatever I tell you to do."       Mikey ran up to Rivers and gave him a big hug.  "Thank you! I won't let you down.  I looooooove you!"       "Mikey, you can let go now," an almost suffocated Rivers choked out.

      Hi, Becca here!  Sometimes I get bored and when I get bored I often like to write little stories.  Here are my little stories.  The first few were orignially posted on Jenny's and my (now defunct) website "Weezer and Stuff".  I hope you all enjoy these stories and I should be writing some new ones shortly!

      I'm so tired.  I think it's because my mom dragged my ass out of bed and made me go to church.  Yeah, I know, I'm gonna burn in hell for not wanting to go to church, but why does it have to be so damn early?  Why can't we be more like the Catholics in the sense that they hold services in the afternoon and in the evening?  I mean, it's boring enough as it is, having it early in the morning is even less of an incentive.  My mom hates it when I crack jokes in church, too.  Today, for example, the Lay Leader had us all take a card as we came in today to explain some story.  I got the ace of clubs, so I said to Kate "Hey Kate! Which of Saddam's cronies does this make me?  I think I'm like Uday or Kusay or one of Saddam's supposedly dead sons..."  Needless to say, we got into trouble... I don't want to go to work tomorrow.  I work for about three and a half hours tomorrow.  What a waste.  I mean, I know I get time and a half, but I'd just rather have my day off than waste three and half hours of my time at work.  It's so stupid.  In fact, I don't even get a full day's pay, I don't think.  It's so stupid and pointless and I hate my job anyway and I'm sorry, it's just such a waste!

      It really bothers me....  When I came home from work today, just as I was getting my first (and only) actual meal of the day, my grandmother calls.  First of all she's one of those people that just doesn't shut up in general, but to make it worse she always talks about her bowel movements and shit like that.  But anyway, so she goes off on this whole tangent about how I shouldn't move to California because it's so terrible there and the economic situation is so much worse there than everyplace else in the world and how I should rethink it and stay up here and how unsafe it is and all that shit.  Really?  And Detroit is different HOW?  I mean, c'mon, my mind is made up and there's no use talking me out of it, so just shut up.  I really don't want to hear it, especially when I've been on my feet all day without anything to eat (I'm really cranky when I'm hungry) and my food is sitting there, getting cold while you tell me how to run my life and comment on how the kid who was busted for the computer virus "looks kind of chunky."  Seriously, what does his weight have to do with whether or not he made some computer worm?  It's no wonder I'm so self-conscious about my weight and how I think I'm worthless because I'm fat.  I mean, she took care of me when my mom was at work, like after school and shit.  I'm sure that her behavior regarding her constant dieting and her attitude toward overweight people might have something to do with my extreme lack of self-esteem..... Oh, well.... I have to train psycho killer tomorrow.  What fun!

      The Violent Femmes put it best when they said "Why can't I get just one fuck?"  Well, I'd like to know.  Being a 22-year-old virgin from everything (including kissing) is really getting me down.  Like, what's wrong with me?  Is it because I'm fat?  Maybe if I lost 100 pounds I'd get laid.  I don't know what it is I'm doing that's so offensive to the opposite sex, but never has a member of the opposite sex ever found me attractive and it bothers me.  All this sexual frustration is building up inside of me and i'm seriously gonna explode if I don't let off some steam soon.  Well, maybe not explode, but self-destruct.  I'm already kind of self destructive as it is, and I don't know what will happen if it gets worse.  What makes things so complicated is that I can't get involved right now.  (not as if there are any desireable men up here, but you know)  If I'm going to California, I can't get tied down.  That is the worst thing that could happen.  So, I guess I have to stick it out a little longer.  It's not just sex.  Yeah, sex is great, but what people don't understand is that the simplest things are precious.  The kissing, cuddling, and other things most people take for granted are important too.  If they had to live as long as I have without it, maybe they'd understand.  I hate how sex is just a commodity anymore.  Sex is the ultimate expression of love.  Sex is as close as two can be - as humanly possible.  Anymore, sex is just something you do, which saddens me.  I don't know.  I guess I'm sounding like a naive idiot.  Maybe I am.  I guess I should shut up before I look even more foolish.  After all, what do I know?  I'm just a stupid virgin.

      Okay so earlier today (I guess it would technically be yesterday, as it's midnight) I had my interview for my job.  What a trip.  So I go in and like nobody knows where the publisher gal is.  They finally get a hold of her like ten minutes later and one of her meetings ran over, so they told me to come back in a half hour.  So, I went to my regular place of work since it's just down the street and gave Phil (who sadly left us today) his glow pen.  I came back and I think the interview went well.  She didn't ask me how long I was staying, she just assumed that I was staying up here because I grew up here.  Hahahaha funny.  I didn't say anything, except "yeah, i've lived up here all my life" and smiled.  So, I really hope everything goes well.  I really, really hope so.  I really, really, really, really, really, really, really hope so.  I don't want to work another day at my current job, especially with that nutcase there.  I can't wait to tell Val and Bob where they can shove their milkcrates. God, I hope I get that job!

      I hate everybody and everything and it's either them or me.... So, everything seems to piss me off right now.  I can't stand my family.  My dad is a total cryass about everything.  Kate's such a baby now that she's been parted from mommy dearest and my mom will never give me the respect I deserve, let alone the handouts, because I'm not Kate.  Don't you know? Kate's a princess and she is absoultey wonderful.  I can't wait until I move out of here and all three of them can rot in Michigan without me.  I don't want anything to do with them anymore. I hate my job too.  I wanna quit.  I just found out that my hours are getting cut for a total nutcase.  Seriously.  My boss hired TWO people to replace Phil and I still haven't found out why.  The first time I met this girl, there was something about her I didn't like.  I was always kind of iffy on her.  Apparently, Phil felt the same way.  Today, I had to train her.  That girl would not listen to me for a minute.  Every time I tried to tell her the right way of doing things, she'd do it wrong.  You can't tell her anything.  She wants to do everything herself but she doesn't know what she's doing.  She thinks she does, but she doesn't.  Everybody else is wrong, too.  She's absolutely untrainable and I don't trust her.  It got worse when I got home and my mom had heard of this girl.  Apparently she was kicked out of her school.  She spent time in mental institutions.  She is one fucked up girl.  Apparently, she was also into drugs too.  She has mental disorders.  She's crazy.  I know my manager would never believe me if I told her, but I'm telling Phil because I think he's the only one who'd believe me.  I now want to quit even more because I don't want any cash swiping she's done on my hands. Right now, I'm ready to tell those people I'm the fucking Queen of England just to get the job; just to get away from the job i have....

      Everyone has up and gone to school and now I'm left here all alone.  Today is the first day of school for a lot of people and it's weird not going.  I've been in this routine for how many years? Now, 17 years later, I'm not doing it anymore.  It's really weird.  I should be headed off to some inane class listening to some boring professor spout out stuff that I really could care less about.  Then there's almost always that one class, that special class, that I fall in love with.  It's almost always an elective that makes me want to change my major, like creative writing or choir (back when I was a freshman, when I loved it, not choir as a senior, when I hated it).  I miss singing too.  God, I'm all alone now and nobody cares about me.  (I know, it's all about me.) There's nobody around for me to hang out with and I hate it.  Instead I am working some stupid-ass mcjob because I can't do any better; because I fucked around in college and couldn't get that killer internship; because I was too obsessed with grades and nothing else; because I didn't like most of the people in the professional organizations or I just didn't know about them, so I didn't join.  God, I am such a screw-up.  I'm such a failure.  I have no friends to hang out with and no real job.  I'm all alone and I hate it.  I wish someone would kill me.  I hate living.  I want to die, seriously.  It's not like anyone would care anyway.  I don't hang out with anyone anymore so it's not like anyone would mourn me.  So what's stopping me?  I should just take the knife and slit my wrists right now.  I hate myself.  I hate my situation.  I hate my life.  I wish Kate and I could trade places.  She's only been at school one day and she hates it.  She can come back home and I can go back, where my old friends are.  I don't even think that most of them are my friends anymore.  They won't talk to me.  I never thought I'd say this when I was an undergrad, but I miss college so much, you have no idea.  Please, God, put me out of my misery.

      Just when I've decided that my job royally sucks and I'm quitting, they throw me a curveball and give me a raise.  Mind you, they haven't given their an employee a raise in years.  Up until now, I got paid the same wage as I was paid when I worked there three years ago - $5.80.  Now they've bumped me up $.25.  I can officially say I get paid $6 an hour.  $6.05 to be exact.  I'm still not completely happy though, but the raise did grant a little redemption. There's this guy who always comes in and harasses me.  Now, I think he's just joking around, like a lot of the other customers who harass me, but the gal I was training was convinced that he liked me.  God, the guy is like in his late 30's, early 40's, i'm guessing.  Too old.  He must fall into my basic standards of a potential: 1. between the ages of 27 - 37.  exceptions will be made for exceptional men.  2.  is currently living or plans to move to L.A. by the month of January (I know he can't fall into that one even if he met the first one).  3.  must not be creepy and have a decent sense of hygene.  if a man has let himself go but is willing to regain his hygene skills, it is acceptable as long as he regains them.  4.  must have good sense of humor.  5.  absolute sweetheart/authentic romantic preferred (but how many guys honestly fall into that category) 5. (and this is the big one) MUST LIKE ME FOR WHO I AM!!!!!  Sorry if i seem picky.  I know beggars can't be choosers, but a girl's got to have her standards.  I hope that's not too much.

      I think God has answered my prayers for a new job, but I think I'll have to break a commandment to make it happen.  So I faxed my resume to this local newspaper that has recently underwent a change in management and a bunch of people quit.  This place was looking for someone for ad sales.  Sales isn't exactly my specialty, but it will look nice on my resume.  Not to mention it's a full time job.  I interview next week and we'll see how it goes.  I know they'll ask me how long I'm staying and I know I can't tell the truth.  A better life awaits me if I lie.  How wrong is that?  I wish that I wasn't so honest.  From what others have told me, I'm honest to the point of brutal.  I've been told it's a good thing, but my honesty has only got me into trouble.  You know, if I wasn't pissed off at my manager, I'd be content just staying with my current job, but with the cut in hours, the increased workload with no increase in pay, the departure of the only co-worker I can stand, and the removal of the crates... there is only so much shit I can take!

      My god, I'm so tired.  I just feel so exhausted right now but I shouldn't sleep if I want to talk to people.... My legs hurt too.... no milkcrates.... I'd like to see Val go a day without her chair.  I want my fucking milk crates back.  As retaliation, I have begun to sit on the floor.  Yes, I realize it looks really bad to the customers but what do you expect when you take away my milkcrates?  Until then, I shall continue to sit on the floor and read Cosmo. Right now I am so fed up with the bullshit of my job.  It's no wonder they have such a high turnover.  When you treat your employees like shit, you can't expect them to stay.  Now, I don't mean that a manager should put up with the shit of the employees, but he or she shouldn't give them shit either.  It should be a shitless situation. I've noticed that the banner ad on the top of my blog features a link for cheap Marlboro cigarettes.  I find that so ironic as I sell not-so-cheap Marlboro cigarettes.  ($4.25 a pack? what an expensive habit....) I don't have much else to say right now.  Maybe I'll come up with something later.

      My superiors keep inching closer and closer to the line.  When they cross it, may God have mercy on their souls...  God, I think i'm going to go to Wal-Mart and apply.  Since they're opening their Super Wal-Mart soon, I heard they're looking for cashiers.  I know it's like selling my soul to the devil, but I'm in hell right now.  First, they make me do all this cleaning shit that I never had to do three years ago.  They keep adding to this stupid ass list of "chores" I have to do and many times I do not have the time to complete these chores.  Next they hire not one, but TWO, people to replace Phil who is leaving for college next week.  My manager says it's because she doesn't want to be shorthanded if someone quits.  If someone quits, I'd gladly pick up the hours while she finds someone else.  When I worked there before we got by just fine on four people, why the hell do we need SIX?  And what if nobody quits?  That means my hours get cut big time.  Also, I asked to have a specific day off for an eye appointment.  Now I will have to cancel it because my manager didn't give me the day off.  I asked co-workers to cover for me but none could do it, even though I'd gladly cover for them.  How come my one co-worker can weasel her way into getting all of her weekend shifts covered and I can't get a fucking weekday off for a fucking eye appointment?  If you thought things couldn't get much worse, they did.  Now, they took away our crates that we sit on at work, meaning I have to stand my entire shift without any breaks.  My leg hurts like hell today because I couldn't even sit down for five goddamn minutes.  This really pisses me off.  Their rationale is that if we have time to be sitting, then we have time to be cleaning.  I agree with my co-worker, Phil's, theory that if we're sitting down then we have our cleaning done.  Phil is the only co-worker I can stand right now and I don't know what I'll do when he leaves.  Because he's the owner's son, he can't get fired so he's the only one with the balls to stand up for us.  In fact he promised me that his dad will hear it about the milk crates and that we'll have them back in no time.  Phil is fun to work with for the hour i get to work with him and he isn't stupid or lazy and he doesn't ream me for everything.  Stupid is Todd.  Todd is a dumbass.  Enough said.  Kristy always tries to dump off her weekends and her laziness pisses me off at times.  Veronica yells at me for every little thing.  Of the three, Veronica is the one I can stand the most, but that's only when she's not tearing me down for something.  She's one of those people where she's the only person who knows how to do anything and everybody else doesn't know how to do anything.  Tina, the gal I trained today is nice though, but I don't know what will happen without Phil standing up for us.  Enough about work.... Seeing "blogger"reminds me of the game Frogger.  Remember that game?  One thing my sister and I have always wondered is why can't frogger go in the water?  I mean frogger is a frog, right? and frogs are amphibians, right?  Amphibians can live on both land and water if I'm not mistaken...  C'mon, frogs can swim so why can't frogger?  What's the deal?

      I have become uncomfortably numb.  At least I did earlier today.  Yeah, so I got my three fillings in and it hurts like hell.  I guess that's making me kind of a bitch too, but you'd be cranky too if you just had three of your teeth drilled.  I hate novacaine.  I mean, yeah, I'm glad I don't feel any pain, but it sucks afterward.  I mean your lips feel like rubber and you can't drink anything without getting it all over your clothes.  I think dentists get shits and giggles when they've numbed up their patients and they have to rinse out their mouths.  I mean I would probably laugh my ass off if I had seen someone else in my position.  I think that's why they make you rinse to the point where it seems unnecessary.  I mean if you had that job you've got to find the few perks.  After all, dentists are the most hated people in our society (true), so it's no wonder they have the highest suicide rate of any professionals (also true). I don't know.  Lately it feels like EVERYONE around me seems to care only about themselves and they don't give a shit about what I feel or what I have to say.  I guess I'm no better than everyone else, thinking like I am, but you know how it goes.  At times it feels like I'm screaming at the top of my lungs but everyone around me is wearing earplugs. I'm alive.  I guess I should be happy.  Why can't I be happy?

      Since I've now officially sold out, I might as well quote a sell-out song.  You know how Sheryl Crow sings "I'm gonna soak up the sun"? I unintentionally did that today.  I unfortunately soaked up a little too much.... Yeah, so I went to a car show today just to take a looksie.  My dad and I rode there in the Mustang ('73 copper brown convertable).  Now I am burned.  I hope I don't peel.  I hate it when I peel.  It reminds me of when my ass would get dragged to football games and the next day half my face would be peeling.  Peeling sucks. Anyway, my mouth is really gonna hurt tomorrow.  I get three fillings drilled in.  Why is it that whenever I get fillings it hurts so much more when they're finished with me than when I walked in?  You know if that's the case then why should I even bother getting my teeth filled?  I mean when I had my root canal it didn't hurt at all.... Oh well!

      Looks like I finally sold out.  I've always said that I wasn't going to bother with these blogs, especially the LiveJournal cult, but I guess that wasn't true.  At least this doesn't have any stupid ass cliquey passwords that you have to know before you can sign up.  I hate LiveJournal. Thanks to my co-worker Phil, who himself sold out to this.  He's the one who got me bloggin' tonight and told me about this site.  I'll miss Phil when he goes back to Alma next week because he's one of the few co-workers I can stand at the moment.  But enough about my sucky job... A little about me... I'm 22.  I recently graduated from college, but due to the shitty economy and my temporary living circumstances, I can't get a decent job.  As a result, I'm selling gasoline and cigarettes.  You know, I never knew that doing case studies of legal cases like Valentine v. Chrestensen and performing in-depth psychological research on priming would be so useful when asking if one wants 100's or kings... (I hope you all sensed the sarcasm in that.) By the way... nyah nyah  I've had power the last two days.  Just thought I'd rub it in (Jenny).

      Oh my God,  urlLink this the COOLEST blender that I've ever seen.  I think I have a new pet.  My mom was fishing her fish out of the pond in our front yard today because it's supposed to get really cold tonight and she has to fish them out anyway because if she leaves them in there over the winter they'll die.  Anyway, she found what she thought was a small lobster.  She said I could keep it as a pet.  It was much too small to boil anyway.  I was going to name it "Rock" (as in Rock Lobster, a song by the B-52's) or "Pinchy" (because there was an episode of the Simpsons where they kept a pet lobster and thanks to Eric, an expert of the Simpsons, I figured out that they named it "Pinchy").  So, later on, when I was looking up care instructions, it dawned on me.  Lobsters live in salt water.  This could not be a lobster.  It had to be a crayfish, a BIG crayfish.  So anyway, now "Rock" is out of the running because it's no longer funny.  ("Rock" crayfish... umm... no)  I might name it "Marron", despite the fact that i'm not sure if it's a Marron or a Yabbie or whatever breed, but after the very bishi character Marron from Bakaretsu Hunters.  I still don't know.  How about "Krusty" the crustacean?  I'm not even sure if i'm keeping it, so you know... Since I have virtually no music at all anymore (pretty much all the music on this computer belongs to Kate), Jenny has been kind enough to give me the hook up and to "share" some of her music with me.  She's sent me quite a bit of the Cure and the Smiths and I'm not sure if it's depressing me more or just making more aware of my depression.  I think it's the latter.  It's really sad when you hear Morrisey describing the details of your life through song.  She sent me some Clash and some Femmes too, but lately the really depressing stuff has been more appealing to me lately.  Well, that's not completely true...  I can  really associate with the sexual angst of the Femmes and as for the Clash (most of what she sent me was sell-out Clash) I can't help thinking of Brian Bell and it's always fun to tease Jenny about him.  Then again, whenever I hear Morrisey's voice I think of that really creepy dead on impression Matt Sharp did of him at the Schuba's show in Chicago last November.  Matt is my hero (even though that has absolutely nothing to do with his numerous impressions)!  I wish I had a burner that worked so I could listen to all the music she sent me at work.  I don't like it getting quiet at work, especially when I'm closing.  Closing is scawwwy.

      So, last night Jenny made the mistake of asking me what she would look like next to her dreamboat Weezer guitarist/Space Twins frontman, Brian Bell.  Through the magic of photoshop, I have simulated what they would look like together:    Awwww.... aren't they cute?  I love photoshop. Anyway, today was yet another "dump Kate off at school, don't even think about visiting your Mt. P. friend" Sunday.  We went to the mall (heehee I almost typed matt) in Saginaw because Kate needed some books for a speech and she won't bend on her topic because the library didn't have the number of books she needed for her topic.  In the Saginaw mall, there was a brand new Hot Topic that just opened.  Now as you all know, I am a people watcher.  It was so amusing to see all the old people as they walked by the Hot Topic.  It was the funniest thing I ever saw.  Old men would walk up at it and stare with appalled looks on their faces.  It was a priceless scene. Yet another priceless scene:  seeing the former university president in Arby's.  You heard me right.  Arby's.  There's nothing like seeing former CMU president Leonard Plachta, you know as in "Plachta Auditorium" (I can't say that with a straight face.) a.k.a. the auditorium formerly known as Warriner, eating at a fast food place.  I do believe he's an accounting professor now which is amusing when you consider that he left the university in such a shitty financial state and left at the appropriate time so the blame would be dumped on current CMU president Mike Rao.  I offered my dad a million cool points if he'd hit him with the van, but my dad declined.  Oh well, that would have been a funnier sight.  You know I think this was the first time I've ever seen Plachta in person, which is sad when you consider he was the university president for about half of my time at Central and I've seen Rao like a billion times in person.  That is really, really sad.

      First of all, I'd like to give a shout out to Jimmy because he gave me a shout out in his blog.  I don't think he reads this, but oh well.  I mean, who really cares about my cursing, angst, horniness, and bitterness?  Okay, other than my main gal Jenny?  I thought so. Speaking of Jenny, her former roommate put up an interesting away message today.  I don't know why I still have the fellatio-happy creature on my buddy list still.  I guess it's in case I need to be nauseated.  She had this big speech on disabilities.  The last part said something about how people with disabilities don't want to be your hero, nor do they want your pity.  They just want to be treated like everyone else.  In that case, she isn't a good example of that.  She rubs it in everyone's face that she has a disability and she blames many things that go wrong in her life on it.  She doesn't try to go on like others with her disability (ADHD).  Now, I apologize if I offend any of you who think you know her personally and think she's the nicest person.  You obviously don't know her like Jenny and I know her.  The happy-go-lucky ball of emotion and energy has a dark side, but she is a master manipulator.  You have to really get to know her to see it, but once you do, you'll realize how fucked up that girl is.  Do not take the term "fucked up" lightly, she has some serious problems that I don't think she herself even sees.  Actually, in my personality psychology class last semester, we were studying personality disorders and when we were looking at them she immediately came to mind for at least one, if not two of them came to mind.   urlLink Narcissitic Personality Disorder  was the main one that came to mind, although she has shades of  urlLink Histrionic Personality Disorder  as well...  Now don't get me wrong, I think she is an inherently good person.  I just think that she needs help.  I think if, in fact, she does have a disorder and gets treated for it, I think she could be much easier to tolerate.  I don't think she'll read this.  I don't regularly speak to her, but if she, somehow, sees this, she should know that I don't hate her or think badly about her.  I just hope she can realize that there's some problems beneath that shell of hers and that she will hopefully find the means to get better.  Speaking of personality disorders, I took a quiz and I might have Avoidant (although I never thought that I would...)      Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    Low       urlLink Schizoid :    Low       urlLink Schizotypal :    Moderate       urlLink Antisocial :    Low       urlLink Borderline :    Low       urlLink Histrionic :    Moderate       urlLink Narcissistic :    Low       urlLink Avoidant :    High       urlLink Dependent :    Moderate       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    Moderate       --  urlLink Personality Disorder Test - Take It!  --      As you know, I come up with "genius" ideas.  Reality shows are so addictive and popular.  Right now I'm watching the Big Brother Finale (way to go Jun!) even though I despise such shows.  Anyway, I have come up with a reality show of my own.  It's kind of like Mr. Personality, only it targets the gender that is the most superficial when it comes to love.  The idea is that we have this single "mr. perfect" kind of guy looking for a lady, as always.  The thing is that he does not see the women  AT ALL!!  That's right, he can't see if "she's hot".  And they're not perfect looking girls.  They're not ugly by any means, but they're not perfect looking women.  They are everyday, regular girls.  REAL girls.  The girls who would be perfect if they looked like supermodels, but guys don't give them a chance because they're not thin or they don't have big boobs, or they aren't blonde and/or tanned.  The first week he is only allowed to chat online and exchange e-mails with them.  He eliminates some girls and the second week he's allowed to talk to them on the phone.  Over time, he will be forced to get to know the girls without seeing their bodies.  He will not see any of their bodies until after he chooses the winner.  I think that show has money and ratings written all over it, especially since i'm sick and tired of seeing perfect looking women trying to win over a man.  It only reinforces the idea that it's okay to be superficial when choosing a date.  I think that's why I can't get a guy.  I'm too fat and ugly :'( .

      Mwhahahahahahahahahahahahaha! (okay that's enough maniacal laughter) Finally things are getting better at work.  Sylvia's ass got canned.  That made me so happy.  There are only three things that could make me happier with my job right now:  1.  getting the crates back  2.  Todd getting fired  3.  getting another payraise because even though I it will never happen it's a nice thought.  This means that we only have four cashiers now, meaning I will be getting at least five days a week.  That rocks, seriously.  Especially now that the stupid blonde is gone.  She sucked as a cashier anyway.  She was awful.  Heehee that is awesome.  More hours for Becca :)!  (I told my boss that I would even be willing to take on six days a week if necessary.  I like getting more hours.) So I wonder who, other than Jenny (you rock) actually reads this anyway.  I see the counter hits add up but I wonder if that's just Jenny and I reading my page.  Oh well.  It doesn't matter anyway.

      Tomorrow is Matt Sharp's birthday, so in case I forget to post tomorrow, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!  (Yeah, I know he'll never read this but it's not as if that really matters.)  Matt, if you want your present you'll have to come and get it ;)  I'll bake a cake... Tomorrow is also the 100th anniversary of the ice cream cone.  In honor of that, Dairy Queen is giving away free ice cream cones.  That's right.  FREE ICE CREAM!!!!! (Somehow, Josh Lukkonen comes to mind there....)  Yeah, they're teeny tiny cones, but they're free and that's all that matters.  It's like when 7-11 had the free slurpees last summer.  Yeah, they were tiny, but they were free.  (Come to think of it that was on another Weezer bassist's birthday...).  So yeah, ice cream... Matt Sharp... mmmmmmm.... Why do I have to have such a filthy mind?  Why oh why oh why?  *slaps her own wrist*

      Did I forget to mention how much I hate closing?  Okay, this time I didn't get off work until quarter to one because one of my admirers (the old one) was hanging out until it was almost time to lock the doors.  That meant that most of my closing tasks were not finished until AFTER I had locked the doors.  I think I also broke my other admirer's heart today.  My other admirer is about my age.  He's cute, but he does nothing for me.  Not to mention I think he's a little slow in the head, if you know what I mean.  That shouldn't matter, but for a girl who's ideal man is semi-intelligent (in other words, know-it-alls need not apply), creative, romantic/sensitive with a killer sense of humor.... well he doesn't fit the bill in any of those categories.  I told the guy that I'm moving away in a few months, but he told me that he'd throw a party for me when I leave.  Yeah, so maybe he is a little bit of a sweetheart, but he lacks intellect.  Yeah, I know, beggars can't be choosers. *shrugs* Sylvia is really getting on my nerves.  She's like desperately trying to dump off her opening shift on Sunday.  I told her that I was taking Kate back to college that day, so I couldn't pick up her shift.  Yeah, I am really doing that, but later in the day.  To be honest, I can't open (if I've EVER opened, it was over three years ago, ONCE, when I was training, but as I recall, I never opened)  and I really don't feel up to working six days in a row.  Yeah, I could use the money.  Yeah, I could use the hours, but Sylvia needed the day off so badly, she should have told Val before she made the fucking schedule.  Sorry if I seem unsympathetic, but when someone who has only worked for three weeks has already called in sick twice and is trying to dump off yet another shift so her and her psycho fiance (accents don't seem to work on here...) can go galavanting around... as far as I'm concerned, she can go fuck herself.  She has lost all her sympathy points.  I know that she wouldn't cover any of my shifts either.  Not to mention she sucks as an employee.  I hope her ass gets fired.  I wish it were Sylvia quitting and not Tina, because I actually like Tina.  Tina does a good job, even though she is quiet.  I would love to see Sylvia's ass get canned (Todd's, too, but that's a different story).  She never has anything done when you're ready to change shifts.  The hot dogs are never ready (Veronica told me that she had to bag them for her today) and she never has her lotto serial numbers written down for us, so she does them in like 1 minute and they're all fucked up and you have to re-write them anyway.  God, I hate that airhead. I wish I had someone to talk to and share all this with, *you know who you are*.  (I'd better get a damn good excuse...)  I hate it when people forget about me.

      I have to close tomorrow night.  Yuck.  I hate closing.  Last time I closed I had a mad rush like 10 minutes before closing and Todd shorted me like $5 for the lotto deposit.  I hate Todd, too.   I remember this incident from the last time I closed that really made me wish that I had paid attention in sign language class.  A group of Deaf kids came to ask for directions.  Mind you, I USED to know how to sign a little but I can't remember a bit of it.  Damn the fact I'm an auditory learner.  Anyway, I did the best I could and I think I did ok.  I got out a pen and paper and I got them a map for them to look at.  Apparently they missed their turn and ended up quite a ways away from where they needed to be. I think I pissed off my sister.  I was in Mt. Pleasant for the last couple days to visit Jenny.  I told Kate I would visit with her too, but at the last minute, Jenny and I decided to do her sociology project that involved going to the mall and I sort of forgot and I really had no way of contacting her, considering I didn't know her number.  Oh well.  Kate comes home every fucking weekend.  I rarely see Jenny, so Kate will have to live with the fact I wanted to spend time with my friend.

      So it's the infamous September 11th once again.  As I suspected, numerous sappy news stories were aired and many vigils were held for those who still just can't let go and move on with their lives.  My day, today, actually started out much like my day two years ago.  I woke up around 10:30-ish and went to the living room to turn on the TV before taking a shower.  Two years ago was a similar case, only I was getting up about the same time because my earliest class was 12:30.  I turned on the radio and caught the end of a news bulletin on the college radio station I always listened to.  I was like "What the fuck is going on?" and I turned on the television.  Like a video tape of a movie that was stuck in a loop they showed the planes hitting the towers over and over and over and over (and they didn't stop until a few months later).  Yeah, I remember the day.  Yeah, it scared the shit out of me.  Yeah, I've moved on.  It's time that everyone else in this country does too.  After all, the people looking down on us from the afterlife who made their ascent that day would really appreciate it, I think.

Your grumbling can go too far and really hurt those around you. Even though you can be hard to deal with, others like you anyways because you are mysteriously charming and cute when you're mad. You are good at fixing things and are willing to take on large tasks...with a little grumbling of course!            urlLink  Take the  Which Care Bear Are You?  Quiz!

      My feet hurt :'( *sob sob* I hate Wednesdays.  Wednesday is when many of the shipments come in, including cigarettes.  Cigarette shipments are a bitch to count and even more of a bitch to put away, especially since the Phillip Morris people came in and took away some of my carton space.  What a pain in the ass.  To top it off, I had to work an extra half hour today.  Why, you might ask?  I didn't find out until AFTER my manager had left that there men coming from the ice cream company to drop off a cooler and tons of ice cream to go in it.  Now, before Todd had finished his counting during the changeover proceedure, one of the guys said, "I forgot to tell you this was a cash on delivery and the other stores have been averaging $250-$300."  I thought 'greeeeeat' because Todd only has $250 in his drawer to start.  There was no way he could make such a payout.  I, however, from working all day had the money to make such a payout, so I told Todd that I would stay on until they were finished so I could make the payout, which was just shy of $300.  That meant that I got off my drawer a half hour later than I was supposed to.  I hope I get paid for that extra half hour..... (Yeah I know it's just $3, but $3 is $3).  A side note:  I MISS PHIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      I'd like to apologize to Jenny.  I have trouble conveying exactly what I want to say sometimes, and she kind of took it wrong.  She thought I meant that she was a terrible listener or whatever.  That is wrong.  What I meant was that I feel bad for burdening her with my problems all the time and that I just thought she was sick of my doing so, for which I couldn't blame her.  That is what I meant to say and I apologize.

      I feel like shit again.  I hate my job.  I hate my family.  I hate my situation.  I hate my life.  I hate everything.  I want to die.  Death can't be any worse than what my life is like right now.  I am so miserable.  I just want to put a gun to my head and start firing over and over and over and over (even though I know it isn't possible).  I wish that God would just take my life right now.  I can't stand the thought of spending another day in this hell.  I am lonely and miserable and it feels, lately, that death is my only option.  I don't know how much longer I can take this. My mother is such a bitch.  I know that if she knew that I couldn't stand living here and wanted to kill myself as a result, she'd send me away to a hospital.  She doesn't understand that all I want is to be listened to and not yelled at for feeling the way I feel.  Every time I am angry or depressed she either yells at me or threatens to send me away.  The way she acts about it hurts me more than helps me.  Because she has threatened in the past to send me away, I know I cannot talk to her about anything.  My father isn't any better because he lacks understanding.  Jenny has been the only person I feel I've been able to turn to, she's got the brunt of my rants, but she's sick of hearing it because whenever I feel bad now, she changes the subject, ignores me, or tries to make me feel bad for how I'm feeling.  I suppose I could turn to Justin, but I don't feel familiar enough with him to do so, but when I occaisionally have ranted to him, he was the best.  He just listened and that's all I ever wanted.  I would feel sorry for him, though, if I knew him better because then he'd hear about how I feel like shit and want to die like all the fucking time.  I wish there were more understanding people out there who would just listen and not threaten or get mad at me or make me feel worse than I did to begin with.  Maybe there are more people like that, but I just don't know these people. Anyway, at this rate, I'll be lucky if I can make it another month without trying to kill myself because I hate living so much.

      Today I made my first voyage back to lovely Mt. Pleasant, MI since I graduated.  Well, second voyage to be exact, but the first voyage was when we took my sister to auditions for band over the summer.  Since there really wasn't anyone there except Bubba, I guess it doesn't count.  I miss Bubba :'(  Anyway, it was really odd, almost surreal.  It was exactly the way it was when I left it (except for some new buildings and shit), but it was strange at the same time.  I kept walking by or running into people I once knew; former friends, neighbors, and classmates.  They kept walking like I didn't exist.  I guess when you graduate you don't exist anymore.  Your sole purpose is to make money so you can give it back to the institution, but if you don't give it back to the institution, you're as invisible as molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide (sorry had to make the only in dreams/weezer reference).  People never gave a damn about me anyway, and I guess nothing has changed.  I doubt things ever will, but I've already accepted the fact that everything keeps going whether your present or absent from the situation.  One thing I don't miss however are the skanks and it looks like there are even more this year than last year.  It appears that the freshman class is full of them.  God, why do they skank themselves out?  It only demonstrates how little self-respect they have.  They are willing to buy into all the media shit they're fed off MTV so they can be popular and in the end get laid.  What's worse is the fact that so many cute guys, which again there seem to be more of this year than last, buy into that message from the media and go for the skanks.  I guess you can't blame them in the sense that they're young men who just want to get laid.  Those fake girls with little self-respect will put out because they think it will earn the hearts of those boys.  The asshole guys love 'em and leave 'em.  The sweethearts will stay and get treated like shit by these girls.  It's so sad to see sweet guys get treated like shit but I guess when they date a girl like that they ask for it, especially when there are so many single, nice girls out there, like Jenny or Kandi for example, who could treat them right.  I'm a fat bitch so I don't fall into that category.  Guys hate fat chicks anyway, so unless I drop like 150 pounds, nobody will ever love me so I might as well get used to being alone.  But being alone is tough to get used to.

      Every once in a while, there is an ad that really makes me wish I had thought of it first.  The commercial in mind is for Jimmy Dean.  That's right, the sausage company.  It's so funny.  These guys are playing squirrel tag and they take it so seriously.  Yeah, I know squirrels are evil, and that's why it takes brave souls like those men to play tag with them.  They wear like protective gear and everything.  I guess the point of the commercial is that because these guys get up so early in the morning to play squirrel tag, they need a breakfast that tastes great and takes very little time to prepare, or at least that's what I'm gathering.  Who cares?  It's squirrel tag and it's fucking hilarious.  God... squirrel tag... I sooo wish I thought of that one... Even though Vanilla Pepsi sucks and Vanilla Coke is much better, I thought the ads for it were sort of funny.  Yeah, the semi with the giant ass speakers were funny the first 25 times I saw it, but it quickly lost its charm.  I'm referring to the one where the machine shuts on and off and the guys are trying to get the soda from the machine.  The guys across the street who are flicking the switch on and off on the machine are like "dance you monkeys" or something like that.  I think it's a pretty funny ad, but knowing how Pepsi tends to buy up so much time that their ads get played without end, I'm sure that ad will lose its charm too.

      There really hasn't been much to say about my life lately because I have no life.   I've been feeling like shit lately.  I'm so tired, but I had the right amount of sleep.  I feel weak and I don't know why.  I'm so miserable too.  It's because I'm lonely and I have no friends.  Well, I have Jenny, but I never get to see her.  I have nobody here for me to hang out with.  I feel so shitty, it's beyond comprehension.  But it's not like anyone cares, and it's not like anyone ever will.  I think I seriously would be better off dead.  I joke around about it all the time, but now, I really see no point in living anymore.  I don't make a difference in anyone's life.  Nobody loves me.  Nobody will miss me.  It's a pathetic existence I live.  Why should I go on stealing tons and tons of needed resources from the world - from people who matter, who are loved by others.  If you can't be loved, then there is no point in living and I really don't see why God chooses for me to go on.  I think that he (or she) likes to torment me.  I wish that God would just take my life away.  It's not as if I'm living, anyway.

      I wish I could have spent my Labor Day  urlLink sitting on a cooler next to a stick saying stuff to people as they walk by  but instead I had to spend Labor Day laboring away on a stupid 3 3/4 hour shift at work.  I did get paid time and a half, but still.  When you're at work for four hours it all seems pretty pointless.... Todd told me that I'm becoming more and more like Phil and that i was weird.  Well, he's not the first one to make a comment on how Phil's personality is similar to mine, but I never thought that Phil was weird.  If I thought anybody was weird, I think it would be Todd.  Besides, Todd reminds me a lot of Milton from office space, except that Milton is lovable and Todd is loatheable.  I think it's just the way Todd studders all the fucking time.  I don't know but that man needs to be slapped upside the head with a stick badly. There was something else I was gonna say, but I can't remember it now.  Oh well....

       Only in Huron County...  So anyway I heard on the news that a cow got loose and that we all should be careful if we're going through town because the frightened cow crossed a "major" road (major being 4 lanes of traffic plus a left turn lane) in the middle of town.  At the time I heard it on the radio, the authorities were attempting to corner the cow behind a trailer park.  That story has a Jeff Foxworthy joke written all over it.  Kristy's fiance, Jeff, and I decided that we were going to pick up smoking.  The Newport rep came in today and she took off a bunch of out of date cigarettes.  Amongst those were packs of True cigarettes.  Because they were old, she tore the tops off the packs.  I must say, True cigarettes have the COOLEST filters.  I think the rep called them air filters or something like that.  In any case, they looked cool.  I think I would look cool if I smoked (this coming from a 22-year-old).  Too bad smoking is so expensive and so disgusting.  There was something else I was going to say, but I can't remember what it was...  Oh well...

      It felt so good to be away from home this weekend.  Already I miss being over at Jenny's.  I am so miserable here. My dad is in the next room watching a movie with the volume at full board.  It's really pissing me off.  Whenever I try to listen to music on the computer or whatever, I have to turn it up and, as a result, my father turns the TV up even louder.  It's really pissing me off.  I miss Jenny too... and the kaluha... and the bahama mamas... and the green apple twisted v... and of course JENNY! So, I'm introducing a new award.  It's the dumbest customer of the day award.  Today the honor goes to this teenager who comes in frequently and bought a half gallon of milk.  As I was giving him back the change he asked me, "What day is it today?"  I said, "It's the 27th."  He threw the milk onto the counter and said, "This milk is out of date.  I want my money back."  Please note, the milk was dated November 3rd.  He claimed the milk was some odd number of days out of date.  I said, "No it isn't.  The milk is dated November 3rd."  He, looking all smug, said, "No, that means the milk expired in November 2003."  I was about ready to deck this guy for his incredible amount of stupidity.  I said, "No, the milk is dated November 3rd which is next week because it is October.  Today is OCTOBER 27th."  Looking a little pissed at me because he must have figured out how much of an idiot he was, he said, "Well I guess I'll buy it anyway."  What a fucking moron!

      HAPPY MOLE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Anyway, it's almost time for me to go to work.  I've changed shifts with Todd today, so I'm closing tonight instead of tomorrow.  I've just been killing time before I have to go to work.  I'm watching the Wayne Brady Show right now and Tony Danza was just on and that made me happy.  Tony Danza rapped!  That was sweet!  What person my age didn't want him to be their family's housekeeper when he or she was a kid?  The man is talented.  He can tap dance and sing to boot.  I want to see his Vegas show sometime because Tony Danza is the shit.  THE SHIT!

      If Veronica doesn't call me tonight, I am calling Todd tomorrow morning so we can trade shifts.  I don't want to work on Friday and I badly want to go to Mt. P. this weekend, so I think Val will be fine if Todd and I trade shifts.  I told him I might not know until Thursday morning, so you know.... Tina is pissing me off.  Yesterday I wasn't even done counting and she was running her reports.  Also the other day she had the nerve to call me while I'm in the middle of 5 o'clock rush to see if she could send someone to give me money to buy her a pack of smokes to give to the 16-year-old stockgirl to give to her.  I don't think so.  That's just what I need to have a cop come in while I'm giving the stock girl the smokes  and get fined and lose my job.  Yeeeah... I don't think so.  Did I forget to mention that while this happened there was a hit and run?  Yeah some lady pulled out of our parking lot and hit a little kid crossing the street on his bike, but I suppose that's beside the point... So anyway I found something I really wanted for Christmas, other than a Vespa... or a certain musician...  I want  urlLink this .  Check it out.  This looks like a videogame I might be good at, or at least not have to use a cheat guide.  Well I don't  have  to use a cheat guide, but I think it enhances the gaming experience and I try to use it as little as possible until I have beaten the game on my own.  Except for sidequests.  Maybe. On a final note, is it wrong that when I saw  urlLink this article  I thought of Jenny's ex-roommate Sarah...?

      I'm so tired.  So I closed last night and didn't get to bed until late, but I thought I would have some time to sleep in a little before I had to go to work the next day.  I didn't have to be at work until 11:45, right?  WRONG!  Veronica's daughter got really sick and I had to come into work a couple hours early.  I pulled about a nine hour shift, working from 9:30 in the morning until almost 7:00 at night.  Needless to say, I'm very, VERY tired.  I also picked up Veronica's afternoon shift for tomorrow.  Now the bright spot is that Veronica told me that if her daughter is feeling better and she can get a sitter, she would work my friday close.  If that does happen and if Val doesn't change the schedule from what she wrote a couple weeks ago, that means that I will have THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, and SUNDAY off.  I'm not getting my hopes up but it is a nice thought.  I wonder if Jenny would be cool with having me come up on Thursday afternoon...

      I got a wonderful suprise when I picked up my paycheck.  I got a third more pay than I usally get.  I think that was because I pulled two six day weeks.  I clocked 4 hours of overtime and worked 76 1/2 hours.  It killed me at the time, but now it's well worth it.  Yay! You know, I really love this random surrealism generator.  I really do.

      Ok talk about an odd occurance.  Last night when I was wrapping up work, my former co-worker and Todd and Kristy's former manager showed up.  Shelly was so shocked to see me.  You see, when she was the manager where I worked she and the owner did not get along.  She's now over at the new Marathon station in Elkton.  She's a sweetie.  I miss working with her.  She told Todd and I that if she ever got a position opening there she would ask us to fill it.  (Todd said afterward, "If she ever asks me I will just walk out the door here and quit that day.")  She also said that the owners actually work.  Man, you don't know what I'd pay to see Bob or Deb actually working in the store.

      I am so miserable right now.  I just want to lock myself in a room and cry until it floods with tears and i drown.  I hate it here so much, you have no idea.  I had this nightmare last night that my entire family was like giving me this really mean and scary intervention about moving to California to keep me here.  To make matters worse, when I get home my mother gives me a lecture on how expensive it is to live out there and how I'll never be able to afford it because even people with good jobs struggle out there.  My parents are constantly lecturing and guilting me into staying here.  I hate disappointing them - I hate disappointing people in general, but I need my freedom.  I am in such a lose-lose situation right now.  I can stay in the midwest and be miserable for the rest of my life and have my parents control my life like they have the last 22 years of my life or I can move as far away from them as possible and have them make me feel all guilty for doing so.  I hate this.  I need to get out.  I just want to die.  I wish God would come and take my life now, that is how much I hate this.  I don't think my parents realize they're driving me to suicide, but if they did, they'd just institutionalize me and i don't want that either.  I just want to be left alone.  That is all i want.  Just leave me alone and let me die.

      I am exhausted.  I just completed day seven of nine continuous days of work.  I'm not getting much sleep either.  I can't wait until friday because I have friday off, but I have to go to Mt. P. to pick up Kate (I think, so it's not like I'll just be able to kick back and relax.  Tomorrow night will be really boring, as I have to close and I'm training the new girl, who already knows what she's doing.  (Considering she worked a year and a half at another convenience store, I think that there isn't much training involved.)  Even my manager told me to bring a book tomorrow night.  Nights are slow as it is, but it's worse when you're just supervising.  This new girl is really good so all I'll be showing her is the closing procedures.  I feel very bleh right now and I am oh so tired.  I want a nap but all i can do is just lay there.  I can't sleep.  Oh well, I get to sleep in tomorrow.     My life is rated PG-13.  What is your life rated?   Hmm.... could I have received that rating because I cuss worse than a sailor...?  I can't think of what else it would be.

      Jeez, can you believe it's October already?  And it fucking hailed and snowed today! I feel so bleh.  I had another shitty day at work and I'm really close to slaughtering my co-worker Veronica.  (Suprised it's not Todd?  Todd has actually grown on me as a person a little, even though I still think he's a shitty worker when it comes to particular things.)  She does whatever the fuck she wants and acts like the fucking manager because her sister is the manager.  If it weren't for that fact, I swear she would have been fired already.  She was ordering me around today like she was in charge.  I hate that.  I really, really, really hate that.  I would love to kill her but she's not worth the jail time.   I think I pissed off Jenny.  She's not online tonight.  It was getting really late last night and she was going on about soulmates.  Mind you, I'm very bitter and cynical about love (could it be because I'm 22 and I've been lonely for so long?) and I don't believe that soulmates exist, at least in my case.  I think she was mad that she couldn't change my mind about it, but I'm not all optimistic about things, especially love, like she is.  Love doesn't exist.  Well, I don't totally believe it doesn't exist but my belief in love is about 25% and falling.  I don't think I was meant to be loved.  Nobody has loved me and nobody will and I think it's time for me to accept it instead of living in an unrealistic world, believing that there is somebody out there, somewhere for me.  Now don't get me wrong, I don't think that Jenny is wrong for believing what she does.  I think her optimism in this cold world is admirable.  I wish I could have a thimble of her hope.  It's getting harder and harder to believe in love... people... myself... anymore.

      I am so sad. Not only do I want to die, but also I typed this huge entry about how tomorrow marks the 1 year anniversary of my seeing Matt Sharp for the first time in concert. When I went to publish it, the computer disconnected from the internet, completely erasing the post. I'm not really in the mood to type it again so if I don't commit suicide first, I will re-type it maybe on Wednesday.

      It all started Thursday.  I got a call Thursday morning on the answering machine from one of the local newspapers.  The gal told me that she kept my resume around and that she had a job opening in the editorial department.  I called back the next day and said that I'd love to take the job but I'm moving out of state in a couple months.  She wasn't there.  I left a message on her voicemail.  Anyway, she called back today and left a message on the machine stating that she wants to hire me on a temporary basis.  Long story short, I have a second job now.  Cool, huh?  I don't exactly know what it is I'm doing, but I'm assuming that it's a proofreading position.  I guess I will know for sure Friday when I start.  The best part is that I can keep my other job too.  Sweeet. Also, Jenny found my dream job: copy writing for Hot Topic.  They have the best benefits (great insurance, employee discount, and concert reimbursements) and a great looking work environment.  I want this job.  I want it with a passion. Ironically, my horoscope told me that opporunity in my career was knocking and to open the door.  Who knew? The northern lights are gorgeous, by the way, but they make me swerve into the other lane while driving.  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD, BECCA!!!! So, I'm going on a quick trip to Mt. P. tomorrow night.  I gotta take Jenny to the mall (heehee I almost typed Matt).  She doesn't have a car and she needs a new suit.  I'll take her Wednesday morning and then come home because I gotta work on Thursday.  It may be the last chance I get to visit her for a while now that I'm working two jobs.  I can't wait to live with her in Cali ^^.  I gotta train the new girl tomorrow, too.  Hope she's good!

      Yeah... so it's been a bittersweet last couple of days.  I went to see Matt Sharp play at Tangier on Sunday.  It was fun, except for the fact that Matt has a girlfriend now.  I know, how disappointing, but I honestly am happy for him.  It was a whole hell of a lot better than seeing him as the downer he was in Hamtramck.  I must say that Matt cleans up very nicely when he's got a girl.  He's keeping his hair cut, himself groomed, wearing nice clothing, and he's very much in shape now (he swims every morning) - a complete 180 from the greasy long haired, 5 o'clock + a few days shadowed, ripped and dirty clothes wearing guy with a paunch we saw a year ago.  I am jealous of this girl.  She must make him so happy.  You can see it in his eyes and his smile.  I really wish I could make him that happy but I can't and there isn't a damn thing I can do about it.  It's not like he knows me or anything and flat out shoved me away.  It's just timing and I'm probably not the one for him, anyways.  I would still kill to be just his friend, but hey, I guess that's just not what this world has in store for me.  I've been depressed lately, but I don't think it's directly from the above.  It's because I feel so alone.  I just wish there was somebody out there for me.  That's all.  On the lighter side, I met THE Karl, Weezer webmaster guru.  He and his girlfriend actually came and sat next to Jenny at the show.  After the show, the valet disappeared and Jen and I wanted to go home, as well as Karl and his girlfriend.  Karl pounded on the doors to let us back in or have someone come out and talk to us to get our keys back, but I saw the valet guy and chased him down.  By the way, Karl plates his vehicle with NY plates... that is sooo awesome.... and probably a whole hell of a lot cheaper.  That's why my car is still in my parents' names, but that's another story.  Wish me the best because there has to be someone amazing out there for me!

      I feel my stomach wringling up into kinky knots.  Jen and I got free tix to a Matt Sharp show tonight.  I have a bad feeling and I don't know why.  Maybe it's because his show in Hamtramck kind of sucked.  Maybe I just fear my own insecurities. I don't know but I just don't feel well, but I badly want go.  I love his shows.  They're so comfortable and intimate.  I don't know... I just don't know...

      Simply Ironic  It's weird how the world works.  I got my Matt Sharp CD yesterday (yay) and I'm going to see him perform Sunday with Goldenboy.  (His album is great, by the way.)  What I found so odd is that last night I was skimming through the radio stations and I managed to find the NPR station who was just about to play the Carmina Burana.  You may be thinking, "What does the Carmina Burana have to do with Matt Sharp for crying out loud??!!"  Well, in November 2002, the day before my first witnessing of a Matt Sharp concert, the day before my simple admiration exploded into a full blown crush, Western Weekend, I performed the Carmina Burana with Concert Choir and Festival Chorus.  It was an exhausting experience with very little sleep afterward because of all the annoying drunks, but a fun and interesting day arrived with a 5 hour trek from Mt. Pleasant, MI to Chicago, IL to see a very awesome show.    Trying to sing along to the Carmina Burana as I blared it on the radio was a trip as well.  I realized just how vocally out of shape I have become within the last year.  What they say is true - if you don't use it, you lose it.  I have so many notes that I think I've lost in the last year since I haven't been singing.  I miss singing so much, but my voice really isn't what it used to be :-\  Oh well!

      WOW!  It's been a while!  I haven't posted here in months...  What can I say?  I'm living in California now.  I have a stupid job where I'm underpaid and underappreciated and I'm not being challenged enough, as usual.  Life has been rough, but I think things will be getting better soon... I hope.

      Had a swell time with Dennis.  We just bummed around the Glendale Galleria for a while, but it was enjoyable.  We went into the Swaroski(?) Crystal store and totally drooled.  Damn that stuff is gorgeously expensive.  There were these martini glasses there that were flippin' awesome.  Also (heh, more realistically) I saw this gorgeous star necklace.  There was this bracelet I really liked there too for $50.  It had a black leather strap and three crystal stars on it.  (*HINT*  someone has a birthday coming in two weeks  *HINT*) In any case, we just hung out, ate some Panda, and just chilled.  It is so nice to get the hell out of the apartment.  Let me reiterate the two things I miss the most right now:  my car and happy Jenny.  I guess some part for my car is like backordered and it won't get there until late this week, meaning my car probably won't get done until next week :'(  I want my car back NOW, but there really isn't a thing I can do about it...  Jenny looks so miserable.  I can't help thinking that she's mad at me or something.  I don't know what I did...  I just hate seeing her this way and I wish she'd get a little faith in herself and CHEER UP!  And now for something completely different...    You're addicted to.....  Nothing!

      I miss my happy Jenny... Jenny really hasn't been herself lately.  She's been really sad.  I can't blame her.  Job hunting is a really depressing thing, but she's beginning to worry me.  Jenny needs to understand that she's only been hardcore job hunting like a couple weeks and that she needs to give it more time.  She is NOT a loser.  She is a highly talented, incredibly creative worker.  Along the line, the right employer for her will see that.  She needs to have more faith in herself and don't let mean interviewers get her down.  I miss optimistic Jenny who thought she was worth hiring and would never let them get her down.  I know I can't expect it all the time, but now is the time she needs to be her old self the most.  Jenny, if you're reading this, SMILE!!!!  You are awesome and the bestest friend someone could have :)  I promise you that one of these days, employers will see just how great you are.  SMILE!!!!!!

      I feel so lonely...  :( I need to go out, get out, get off my ass.  There are people out there and maybe someone out there won't hate me like everyone else does.  There could actually be someone out there who would be able to tolerate me at least as a friend.  I probably could never find anyone who would be interested in me in a romantic sense because I am too fat to be loved.  I mean, maybe if i was skinny and cute or at least thinner and pretty someone would find me attractive, but there is no place for a fat girl in this world.  What is it that men have against us?  Am I less of a person because of my weight (if anything I would think I would be more of a person)?  Maybe I'm just too much to handle.  I don't know what it is that makes me so goddamn unattractive.  Why does my weight have to be such a fucking big deal?  It's not like I have problems fitting into chairs or I get winded walking upstairs.  Yeah, I admit that I could stand to shed some weight, but why should that keep a guy from dating me?  I mean I don't see myself as being grotesquely unhealthy.  Maybe there's something wrong with the fact that I don't see it, but I honestly don't see what the big deal is.  I think there are much worse problems a person could have, such as selfishness, major personality problems, no sense of humour, etc.  On a side note, I really, really, REALLY miss my car.

      Ok I'll try not to be so much of a downer this time, even though I still feel really depressed because I never get to go anywhere...  Here is a random, not-so-depressing/angry thought... I was listening to my Jeff Buckley CD that an old friend from college choir, Nick T. (no, the boy next door who was also in choir was Nick S.) burned for me.  At the time, I was just getting exposed to the glory that is indie and wasn't able to fully appreciate it then.  (I'm not saying I didn't like it, but I think I listened to it twice then before it got lost in the shuffle of my other CD's.)  After such a long time, listening to it blew my mind, and then I thought about it.  College had to have been the best thing that could have ever happened to my taste in music.  If it weren't for college, I'd still be immersing myself in the world of metal and 70s progressive rock.  I'm not saying that those particular genres of music suck now (I mean, come on, Zeppelin?), but there is so much more to music than "Stairway to Heaven".  Besides, I was growing up, and growing out of metal.   Anyway, it's so unfair that those of us who grew up in the sticks are so far removed from anything cool.  I see these young kids who are into great music and it makes me totally jealous.  Of course all these kids are suburbanites who couldn't comprehend having no cable and having to drive over an hour to get to a shopping mall.  (Yep, been there, done that.)  A lot of these kids had the opportunity to better practice their talents, too.  I mean most of these kids who are into music and grew up in affluent suburbs had the money to buy the necessary equipment and lessons to become proficient musicians.  Every kid in the sticks proficient on a non-marching band instrument (or piano) either had a parent who was a musician or didn't come from the sticks initially (or they're just lucky to know someone who knows how to play).  Nobody wakes up a proficient musician.  I can't imagine what my life would be like if my parents knew of a decent voice teacher and footed out the money for me to take lessons.  I probably wouldn't be a secretary - that's for sure. I know there are others like me out there.  Walking talent being wasted because they don't have the necessary tools.  A lack of interest because what is there for them to listen to? Ted Nugent?  Either that or shitty pop music or country...  I wish I could have grown up in an affluent suburb.  It gets me too, because those spoiled brats have no clue what they've got and they take it for granted.  It makes me sick.  Anyway, what makes a depressed girl like me feel a bit better?

      So the online catfight has begun... First of all, yes I do remember what it was like when I was searching for a job, but Jen is neglecting two very important facts:  1. she already has a job (which I never did at that time) so she at the very least has some form of income and 2. she is acting like this after about 2 +/- weeks of hard core job hunting.  That's right two weeks.  Talk about a lack of patience.  I at least didn't get this way until after maybe 1 1/2 - 2 months, which is understandable, but TWO WEEKS???  Yes, I do understand.  She calls me unsympathetic, but she's not telling you the whole story.  First of all, she cancells her date with Will on Saturday (which is a whole other long story of lack of sympathy and forgetting what it's like on  her  part), so she had  promised  me we'd go out and do something instead.  They made her work an extra hour and she was dog tired when she came home, so I said, "Okay, it's fine if you take a nap.  We don't have to do anything big."  She took a nap and all was well.  When she got up, we slowly began to discuss things to do.  I wanted to go out for ice cream.  She suggested going to the fucking grocery store and picking up some.  That wasn't what I had in mind, but I let it slide.  Next, we start talking about going out to eat.  It was a fine idea, but then Jen started to complain about how little money she had.  I offered to pay, but that wasn't good enough for her and she FREAKS OUT and starts job hunting at 9:30 on a fucking Saturday night.  I thought maybe this would only be a few minutes, but soon enough it was 10:00 and she was still freaking out about jobs.  It was clear that I wasn't going anywhere this evening, so I decided to spend some quality alone time in my room to cry out my disappointment. You know, she didn't even make an effort to see what was wrong.  She didn't even say anything until I actually came out of my room for a glass of water.  She said that had I told her I wanted to go out, she would have stopped, which is bullshit because she knew I wanted to go out and I know her - she wouldn't have stopped.  If we did leave, she would have spent the entire time worrying and complaining anyway, which defeated the purpose of going out.  I had contemplated going back out to the living room instead of my room, but I knew Jen was just going to cold shoulder me and spend the entire rest of the night on her computer, like she always does, so I really was better off alone.  After I went to my room she yelled to me in a really snotty voice, "I see you don't want to talk to me!"  I did respond.  I said "No, it's not that," but she ignored me as I figured she would. You know, all I'm asking for is an apology and that she'll make it up to me, but I know I'll never get that because Jenny never apologizes.  She's never sorry for anything she does.  I admit, I should have been more vocal about my extreme disappointment that she broke her promise, but I don't think she would have listened to me anyway.  It seems she only fully pays attention when she reads it on a computer screen.  (I hope you're paying attention.) I'm sorry for feeling that I have to take it to my blog, but I think that's the only way you'll ever listen to me.  I'm sorry for being so immature about this and I wish we could work out our problems like adult.  I'm sorry for spending so much time in my room, but it's because lately I feel I'm my own best friend.  I don't think anybody really cares about me and that I'm probably better off dead, but you probably don't understand and I don't expect you to.  You probably don't remember what it feels like to be so alone, to feel like NOBODY cares about you, to feel like NOBODY cares if you just disappeared, to feel like you wanted to die physically so badly because you felt so isolated and dead on the inside.  This isn't your fault, but lately, you haven't helped.  I'm sorry for being so selfish, but I think to some extent it's true.  The reasons why I stay in Encino when you close have little to do with my fear of driving anymore, but more to do with the fact that I get to go out and see people and I'm not trapped in this apartment all evening.  I enjoyed watching people and making observations as I sat inside a Starbucks in Ventura.  I just wish that we could go out and observe people and share our observations, but you won't!  You won't go out!  Can't you see how much it's suffocating me to be here? I'm sorry if the words I said hurt your feelings, but I wasn't this bad this morning until I read your blog, because you hurt my feelings.  You probably don't to be my friend anymore and I should have seen this coming for the last few weeks.  I'm sorry for all the things I must have done to make you feel that way.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for whatever I've done to make you hate me.  I don't want you to hate me anymore, but I want you to understand how much being trapped in this apartment is killing me.  I know the job thing is rough, but you really have to give it more time before you freak out, okay?  Two weeks is not enough time.  It took me almost 4 months, for crying out loud.  I'm not saying it will take you 4 months, but you need to realize that it's not going to happen immediately.  You need to be prepared in case it takes like 2 or even 3 months.  It might take you until August.  You can't expect to have it right away and the more impatient you get, the longer it will take.  God uses these things to teach us patience, don't you know that?  You need to just calm down and work a few hours each day, except for maybe Saturday when it won't do you any good, and send resumes, even to jobs you don't completely qualify for.  You never know, they might just take a chance on you.  Please don't take your lack of funding out on me.  If need be, I can help you out (just not right now, as I'm dealing with the car thing).  I can take a raincheck on the birthday gift (you are still getting me one, right?), all I ask is that we try to enjoy ourselves a bit more.  By sending out your cover letters and resumes, you've done all you can do.  If it bothers you that much, then hound them.  Send mailed copies.  Nag them if you can.  I've heard that it can work.  Now, all that I've probably said hasn't made one damn bit of difference to you, but that's all I can say. Now, if you need me, I'll just be in my room...

      It's just a boring Saturday morning/afternoon.  Jenny's at work so it isn't like I can go out and do anything (nor can I really afford to...) My neighbors are loud and annoying.  Man, I hate that.  I'm considering, despite the nice cool breeze coming through the window, just to shut the windows and turn on the A/C just so I don't have to hear their stupid music.  It isn't even good music.  I think it's foreign, too... hell it'd have to be... no American in their right mind would produce songs this bad... but then again if you take a look at pop music (eew) Americans really do produce songs that bad...

      9:30 a.m.:  So, my boss went on a little vacation and left me with quite a bit of busy work.  I have to print addresses (with a computer) onto envelopes for a mailing that involves over 5,000 people.  Now, I can't just print out 5,000 labels, mind you, I have to print them out individually on the envelope.  Fortunately, if these special envelopes come in, I only have to do about 1,000, but as of right now (and I worked on this yesterday too) I am at contact #177.  This really sucks and I am well on my way to using up all my toner and burning out the printers.  So, to keep myself from going crazy, I will do a little low involvement quiz taking.  Here are my results, so enjoy!  ---   My #1 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  What College snackfood staple are you???  , is  Pizza!!!- made to order, adaptable, and loved by everyone!       You are Xuan Wu!  Mythological background: Because the turtle has a thick, solid shell that serves as protection -  this animal is associated with stability. You enjoy intellectual pursuits.  Also, in Feng Shui (the Chinese myths behind choosing a house), the black turtle's solidity is used to protect from cold northern winds.    urlLink   Which Chinese Mythological  Being  Are You?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       You have a Lost Soul. No one is really sure what that can always mean, because it can be defined in many ways. As Legend goes, lost souls were the spirits of passed away people who are neither in heaven nor hell. They walk the earth, brooding mysteriously, always appearing when you expect it least. So hence, if you have a Lost Soul, then you are probably very insecure and shy. Stuck in your own little box, you watch the world fly by as a loner. You dont know your place. You seemingly dont have a place in society or an interest. You are a very capricious person, and are confused and frustrated about where you belong. You crave for the sense and feeling of home-but have not obtained it yet.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses?

These angels were once upon a time, very loved, and of the highest ranks of all the angels. But, when something terrible happened in their lives, much like the dark-angels, the outcats leave the heavens and move down to earth. Out cats angel are not nessearily evil. In fact, they are quite kind, but filled with greif and guilt unimaginable. Outcast angels are usually formed when they have failed something, and ridden with guilt, they are banned out of heaven, sent down to earth, and live alone. They are always quite and sad, and rarely contact with humans. If a huam befriends an outcast angel, they have a friend for life.    urlLink   What Kind of ANGEL are you?

I found a system to get this done faster, so it's going a lot better, provided that the printer doesn't burn out or anything *knocks on paper because it was once wood, because the desk isn't made of real wood, even though the paper is on top of the desk, but i suppose it doesn't matter...*  ---    You are a Siren.

Unfortunately, the other envelopes came in today so I'll have to do the other 4,000 contacts next week, I'm sure, but I guess that's what you get in a crummy job where you're overqualified and underpaid.

      I think things might be looking up, but I hope I haven't spoken too soon.  I just had this feeling that things are going to get better.  I don't know why.  I just feel that way. One of the brokers in my office, Bernie, recommended to me an excellent body shop.  I dropped the car off there yesterday morning (after a lengthy battle with my insurance company where they refused to tow my drivable, yet unsafe, car) and already they have the parts and the final estimate.  Hopefully, the car should get fixed soon.  I will have to rent the car an extra week, but that's life I guess... This rental car is spoiling me.  I will miss the CD player...  and the new car smell... but I really, really, really miss my Toyota. Anyway, I can't wait until all this is over.  I want to go out and have fun and meet some people.  It's getting kind of boring just sitting here in the apartment, most of the time all by myself, zoning out in front of brainless, televised entertainment while Jenny talks to her online friends and posts on message boards.  I have no clue where the decent places to hang out in L.A. are.  If you could clue me in to some low-key, but cool, places in the Silver Lake/Los Feliz/Atwater or Pasadena areas, please do so (because Glendale sucks and I only live here for the cheap apartment, yet close proximity to L.A.).

      I hate myself. Okay on friday I wrecked my car (just a fender bender, really).  Saturday I rented a car and scratched within 5 minutes of driving it (the car didn't fit into my very compact parking spot at my apartment).  I have come to the conclusion that I am, in fact, the worst driver ever and I don't want to ever drive again.  Also, I feel so alone.  Especially now that Jenny has Will.  She says "how can I like him when I've never met him" but somehow I don't believe her.  Just from the way that she talks about him, I can tell that it's more than that and she'll probably date him and desert me.  She says she won't do that either, but when you've been deserted by your once single friends for boyfriends on a nearly constant basis, you tend not to trust comments like that.  I've been around it enough that I know the drill.  Besides, Will is just a reminder that Jenny is so much more attractive than I am.  The nice guys love her because she's so goddamn cute.  What do I have to offer the opposite sex? Nothing.  It really hurts to be reminded on a daily basis how unattractive I am.  It's not like she even tries either.  She puts her stupid profile up on these networking sites and guys message her.  Now, I'll admit that my myspace.com profile is a little mean - stressing how I'm not there for dating and that I'm in a relationship, but that's because any guy who has ever messaged me off one of those things has been a creep.  I actually would rather be friends with someone first - to get to know him better - before going out on a date or anything. So here I am.  Alone again.  Nobody to give a rat's ass about me. Let's face it - I WILL NEVER FIND A MAN!!! I wish that people would like me but they don't and I don't know what I ever did to them.  It's probably because I'm fat, because being overweight is such a crime in this society.  It's like I have this contagious disease that leaves me completely disfigured and open for the ridicule of others.  Nobody wants anything to do with me because they act like they're afraid the'll become fat or less cool or whatever just from associating with me.   I'm thinking about killing myself again.  Now, you know I don't really do it because I have a paralyzing fear of death, but I'm not sure how much more living I can stand.   If you want to send happy messages my way to try to cheer me up, go ahead. [I need a hug :'( ] I don't know if it will help, but I know I won't receive any messages anyway.  I mean who cares about stupid, fat, ugly ol' me?  It's not like anybody ever reads this thing anyway...

      I'm slightly disappointed in the fact that blogger cut off my interests.  It's bad enough that I had to make some major cuts in my interests - especially my music interests - but then they don't even publish the whole thing.  How disappointing!  If you want to see my full and complete profile, it's at myspace.com http://profile.myspace.com/users/4507005  Anyway, I've been really depressed lately.  I feel so lonely and lately I've been feeling very isolated by other people.  I think I might have worked out some of my problems, but I don't know.  I still could use some friends.  It's all becoming too much for me to take and I feel empty and black inside.  I don't know how much longer I'll be able to last.  I need something to hold me together, but I don't know what to do.  If you can offer any help or kind words, feel free to shout them out to me because I've been such a downer lately.  Jeez, not even an NBA championship by the Pistons is cheering me up.  (YAY PISTONS, btw)

      Okay I really miss weather.  I don't even bother looking at the weather channel or for forecasts now that I live in SoCal.  The every day on the 7 day forecast is almost exactly the same:  either sunny or partly sunny, low in the mid to upper 60's, highs in the upper 70's to lower 80's.  I miss Michigan where the weather was so unprectictable.  It would go from sunny cool and comfortable to stormy and humid within a matter of minutes.  I miss how the meteorologists never ever seemed to be right, but you knew that they were trying to figure it out.  I miss how a minor cell would explode over Saginaw Bay and how the very same body of water would make a giant storm dicipate.  I miss thunderstorm watches and tornado warnings on little Michigan maps in the corner of the screen... but there are some things I don't miss at all.  I don't miss the sticky humidity that would turn my hair into an instant Ben Wallace afro the minute I stepped outside.  I don't miss the winter weather either.  Yeah, the snow looks pretty and all but I never want to have to go out in below zero weather and scrape the ice off my car ever again.  I don't miss wondering if I'll get stuck in the snow.  I don't miss having to look out for icy patches on the road that could send me careening into the ditch. Hail is kind of iffy.  I miss it but I don't miss it at the same time.  I mean, hail is so cool when you see it bouncing off the sidewalks and you see the tiny pearls of ice on the ground, but hail damage truly sucks. It's so sad.  I call home just to see what the weather is like because it's warm, sunny, and boring here.

      GO PISTONS!!!!!! Seriously, I am like the only person in L.A. rooting for the Pistons.  Normally I really could care less about basketball.  In fact I'm usually just sobering up from the Stanley Cup Finals this time of year.  But the Wings got out early this year (again) and I noticed that the Pistons were in the hunt, so I backed 'em not giving a crap about the damn lakers.  I may live in L.A. but I love my Detroit sports.  Anyway, everyone doubted my beloved motor city bad boys, but look at them now - one win away from the NBA championship.  Even if I was here all along, I still think I'd be rooting for the Pistons in this deal because I've been annoyed by so many Laker fans.  They are so cocky and whiny it's pathetic.  Before the finals they were all like "Oh, we're gonna sweep!  The Pistons suck!"  I already know what their excuses will be after Detroit wins the title.  "Well, Karl Malone was injured and on the bench."  I'm sure there will be other excuses said in denial of the FACT that the Detroit Pistons won the championship.  If I see one more Laker flag waving on a car i will snap it off.  Jeez even one of the dj's was trying to make fun of the Pistons and he was making fun of how ugly they were.  I'm sorry but that is so immature.  Besides, looks won't win you an NBA title.  Sorry.  I guess the fro was too much for you.

      Two more....  So anyway, work was another total snooze today.  I spent almost the entire morning just reading  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  because there was nobody around and nothing to do.  I must say, so far,  Goblet of Fire  is my least favorite of the books, but it is getting better and it's not like it's a bad book.  You see, I needed something to read and Jenny lent me  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  since I had never actually read the book.  I was hooked and immediately began the second book when I had finished the first one.  I was so addicted when I had finished  Chamber of Secrets , that I made Jenny go out and buy  Prisoner of Azkaban .  In fact, I'm fortunate enough that  Order of the Phoenix  is coming out on paperback soon because Jen refuses to buy hardcover books.  I will throw that all to hell when  Half-blood Prince  comes out because I know that after  Order of the Phoenix  I will NEED to read the next one as soon as it hits shelves or it will drive me crazy.  Yeah, I know, I've become this total Harry Potter nerd, but the books are so good and (with the exception of the beginning of  Goblet of Fire ) very fast paced reads with just this flow that you absolutely cannot stop reading them.  I mean they look so thick and intimidating, but you really just burn through them and have a swell time.  To think, this was the first non-manga, non-required book I've read in a very long time.  I guess I can thank Harry Potter for helping me love to read again.

      Now serving #97...   Yeeeeeeeaaaaah..... so I'm really bored.&nbsp; Not much going on.&nbsp; Pretty quiet at work, pretty quiet at home.&nbsp; Power went off last night.&nbsp; That was a real peach because I was in the middle of cooking dinner when it went off.&nbsp; Fortunately, it was only off for about 1/2 hour.&nbsp;   Jenny's been really big into the tarot lately.&nbsp; I'm still trying to determine if it's just bullshit.&nbsp; You see, it all started when I mentioned to her that I was having recurring visions and dreams.&nbsp; They all involved this one young boy - supposed to be a son of mine - who died in a painfully ill state.&nbsp; The funny thing was that this dream took place in the past and the boy had this sort of aura or warmth which was exactly the same as the one I felt when I had first met this one particular person.&nbsp; This feeling was so unique that I've never felt it around any other person.&nbsp; I wondered what all this meant so Jenny bought a book on past life tarot spreads.&nbsp; She's been doing these readings for me and they won't say a thing about the visions.&nbsp; They keep telling this story of how I was rich and I wanted my&nbsp;freedom and either I fell in love with a guy who was of lower class or I got knocked up or something like that and I got disowned.&nbsp; Jenny says it's a "psychic override" - that the cards want to tell me this first because they think it's more important.&nbsp; I'm thinking that this all might be bullshit, but what do I know...&nbsp; I'm one of those people that have a bit of difficulty believing in anything, including myself and other people, let alone spiritual things.&nbsp; I guess you could call me a skeptic, although my wall of skepticism has been on constant erode for years now.&nbsp;   Oh yeah!&nbsp; I'm excited!&nbsp; I get to see Matt Sharp perform with Goldenboy again, this time at the Knitting Factory.&nbsp; They're actually doing three shows, but I only bought tickets to one of them because it's easier for Jen to get a Monday night off as opposed to a weekend evening.&nbsp; We could just shoot down the 101 to Hollyweird anyway.&nbsp; If Jen happens to have the time off and the tix are still available, I'll go to the other two shows, maybe.&nbsp; I kind of feel sorry for Jen because right now the Space Twins aren't doing shit.&nbsp; What a shame.&nbsp; It would be fun to see them.

      Have you heard the news?&nbsp; I am so depressed about it.&nbsp; Ozma broke up.&nbsp; It's such a shame.&nbsp; I love that band so much.&nbsp; They were like Weezer done right, since Weezer sucks anymore.&nbsp; I really wished it would have been Weezer instead, but it had to be Ozma.&nbsp; I'm so sad because I never got the chance to see Ozma perform and I really wanted to but since I moved out here I was either too poor, too busy, or too preoccupied to go out.&nbsp; Now I'll never get to see them.&nbsp; How sad.&nbsp; It pisses me off too because Ozma was sooooo gooooood.&nbsp; I mean they never really had that point where they just started to incredibly suck (like what's been happening to Weezer for the last 3 or so years).&nbsp; Why do all the really great bands have to break up?&nbsp; Why can't the bands that were once great and now incredibly suck break up instead (and yet Weez - I mean they - stay together).&nbsp; I guess it's for the best.&nbsp; I mean, this way Ozma never had the opportunity to get to that phase where you just suck and people wonder why you're even still together (*coughs* weezer).&nbsp;  Okay, yeah, in case you haven't figured it out already, I really wish Weezer would break up, but let me argue my case before you all threaten to kill me.&nbsp; At one time, Weezer was an excellent band.&nbsp; Blue album and Pinkerton were sweet albums - unique, melodic, and all around great.&nbsp; It all seemed to go downhill right about the time Matt Sharp was kicked out of the band, but I'm sure that's  purely coincidence .&nbsp; Green album was a total sellout with about  maybe  3 good songs and the rest&nbsp;of the songs seemed indistinguishable from each other.&nbsp; Maladroit.... well... it would have been a better album if Rivers had just taken a little more time on it.&nbsp; Frankly, most of the tracks sounded very incomplete and unfinished and in a few cases, the demos sounded much better than the final tracks.&nbsp; Aside from the downsliding&nbsp;quality of music from the band, the guys don't really seem to enjoy it anymore.&nbsp; I think it would just be better for the guys to do their own things.&nbsp; I think if Rivers truly applied himself, he could start writing some melodic masterpieces again.&nbsp; He has a lot of talent that he's just not using to its fullest and I think Rivers could do better than he's doing - tons of unused potential.&nbsp; Speaking of unused potential, the Space Twins could possibly be an underground indie cult favorite if Brian just had the time to work on it.&nbsp; If he wasn't in Weezer, he and Tim Maloof could work on some great material for a new album.&nbsp; Brian also needs to focus a bit more on that unique style of writing he used to have (i.e. Osaka Aquabus, Goddess of Love) instead of getting too emotionally wrapped up with his music (i.e. Nothing for Love, Running Out of Time).&nbsp; If he and Tim had the time to really work on it, the Space Twins could really be something special and with Weezer out of the way, they'd have the time.&nbsp; The Special Goodness, on the other hand, could be arena gods if Pat had the time to focus more on his songwriting.&nbsp; TSG is a great live band and if Weezer broke up he and Scott could do that full time... if it weren't for Atom being in the Offspring now.&nbsp; I'm sure they all could work something out, and if TSG isn't enough for Shrinedog, I'm sure there's a metal band in need of a bassist somewhere, because let's face it rock and metal are Scott's elements - NOT powerpop.  I just realized it's my 96th post.&nbsp; 4 more 'til 100!&nbsp; Maybe I'll have a party or something...

      I am so tired and so bored.&nbsp; It's very, very quiet at work and, minus a couple of busy spurts, it's been quite a slow day.&nbsp; I haven't had a lot of sleep in the last few days either.&nbsp; It's like I cannot get any restful sleep at all - I always seem to be waking up every hour or so, but when I'm out of bed I'm dog tired and could crash instantly.&nbsp; I think the only thing that's been keeping me awake the last two days have been the noise of the people working on our balcony/walkway.&nbsp; It sure as hell isn't the phones keeping me awake. Days like these make me loathe my work even more and make me really antsy to get out of here.&nbsp; I want to start a record label with Jen really bad, but that's not something that is within the current realm of possibility.&nbsp; Maybe in a few years... but not now. Anyway, this life is really beginning to suck.&nbsp; Actually no, I can't say beginning because it's always sucked.&nbsp; I guess there's nothing I can do about that unless I kill myself...

      I want it I want it I want it I want it I want it so badly...&nbsp; Have you seen the 4th gen iPods?&nbsp; They are FUCKING AWESOME!!!&nbsp; I haven't seen one (obviously because they're not out yet) but I have seen the pictures and read about the features and my god it is sweet.&nbsp; I will have to save away some dough (like $400 because I want to spring for the 40 GB goodness), but it will be worth it to not have to lug around case upon case of cd's whenever I go anywhere.&nbsp; Yeah, I know there are other, cheaper mp3 players out there, but I just love the iPod.&nbsp; Not only is it very asthetically pleasing, but also I have many songs that I've purchased from iTunes and I don't think they will work on other mp3 players.&nbsp; I mean I've already purchased those songs and iTunes is the best site to purchase mp3's from because they don't just feature mainstream pop artists unlike other mp3 sites.&nbsp;  So, for those of you who may have forgotten my recent birthday and would like to get me something there's an idea.&nbsp; It's also a good idea for Christmas, but I'm not sure if I can wait that long (unless it takes Apple that long to release it).&nbsp; Or, if you just want to make my day, you can get it for me, too. (Don't worry, Jen, in the highly unlikely event that someone does give me a 4th gen 40 gig iPod, I won't open it until you have one, ok?)

      This blog entry goes out to all the freaks, goths, true&nbsp;punks, and other non-conformists of the world.&nbsp; I envy all of you.&nbsp; You refuse to be victims of the pressures of capitalism and our society.&nbsp; You do whatever the hell you want and you don't care. I wish I could be like that.&nbsp; Instead, I&nbsp; was just another casualty. I see all of you when I go out and about, wearing clothing that's outside the norm, pierced, tattooed, and hair dyed.&nbsp; What I would give to be able to dye my hair whatever color I want and not have to worry about getting fired... to be able to have a sweet tattoo and not have to worry about never being able to find a decent job, because all this seems to hinge on cash. In this society, you absoultely cannot live without money and unless you look and act a certain way, you cannot obtain a decent job to receive money so you can have an apartment, have a method of transportation, and eat, not to mention pay my bills for attaining an absolutely useless diploma.&nbsp; It seems that the only people who can afford to live on their own terms are musicians, artists, writers (and I have absolutely no talent in the three aforementioned fields), people who don't care if they're struggling, people who change their terms to conform with society's standards, and people who work at Hot Topic.&nbsp;  It is confirmed.&nbsp; I am a sellout.&nbsp; That's why I am miserably working an office job in a real estate office that I'm incredibly overqualified for.&nbsp; That's why I majored in advertising when I should have majored in English.&nbsp; That's why I'm constantly worried about whether or not I'll have enough money for rent and bills instead of worrying about my own happiness and I'm sick and tired of it, goddammit!&nbsp; Since when should multi-billion dollar corporations (our own government included) dictate my needs and concerns?&nbsp; Since when?&nbsp; Since I became a victim of capitalism and social standards.

      Yeah, so yesterday was my birthday but it really wasn't anything special.  I just saw a great show at the Troubadour - Camera Obscura is awesome and you all should check them out, especially if you like Belle & Sebastian - and that's about it.  Nothing special.  Not like anybody cares or anything.  I mean if nobody cares about you the rest of the year, why should your birthday be any different.  (Oh, special thanks to GoodSpacedWeezer - whoever you are - for wishing me a happy birthday even though we've never before conversed ^^)

      Well folks I have some good news and some bad news....  First the good news...  I HAVE MY CAR BACK!!!!! =-D  YAAAAAAAAAAYYY!  The bad news is that with the rental car and the deductible, I've spent over $1,400.00.  That really blows.  Thank god for credit cards, but now I'm even deeper in debt and that's not good.  I guess I'm just happy to have my car back and to have this all overwith.  I even went out and gave my car a hug.  How pathetic is that?  More good and bad news, but this time it's combined.  Tomorrow is my birthday.  Yeah, I know, I should be happy.  It's my birthday for crying out loud.  My birthday always makes me depressed because it's one more year that I have spent ALONE.  I hate it.  I don't want to be alone anymore.  One time, I told myself that if I never did anything with a guy (and I'm not just talking about sex here, I mean like kissing... anything...) by the time I turned 21, I'd off myself.  Here I am, two years later, and I'm still a pathetic loser that hasn't done a thing with a guy.  I kinda wish I had offfed myself.  I'm 23 (well... damn close to 23) and I'm still a loser.  I don't know why nobody wants me.  It's probably because I'm fat and ugly.  Nobody likes a fat and ugly girl.  I don't know what all the guys' problems are.  I mean, it isn't like I'd be a bad girlfriend.  I actually think I'd make a pretty darn good one.  The pretty girls all take their guys for granted - treat them like shit.  If guys only knew that the fat, ugly girls (and the shy geeky ones too) treat their men the best because they have more of an appreciation for men.  Skinny pretty bitches don't understand that because they can wrap any guy they want around their little finger and when they get sick of them they can just throw them away.  That's not right, but guys fall for it over and over and I don't get it.  I guess it's true that looks are more important than brains or a good sense of humor, I just need to learn to deal with the sad, sad truth.  Please can I be your girlfriend?  I'll treat you nice...

      A bittersweet triumph occurred today.  My car is fixed, finally, but I can't get it because of the fucking insurance company.  You see, they won't release me the car unless I pay full price or they hear from the insurance company.  The insurance company never called them.  What the hell?  So anyway, until they hear from the insurance company or get their money I can't have my car.  This really, really, really, really blows.  All I want is to have my fucking car back.  That's it.  And every day I have to wait, I owe more money to the rental car company.  ARRRGH!!!! I just want my Toyota back.  I miss it so much :'(

      And the earth shook beneath us...  Yesterday I felt an earthquake.  It wasn't anything big, only a 3.4 centered about 20-25 miles away.  It felt a lot like a little sonic boom.  There was a sort of a quieter boom and everything rattled a little.  I honestly thought it would be way cooler like tornadoes are, but it was nothing special.  Just a little shaking....

      I can feel the stomach acid wearing a hole in my tummy.  I am still freaking out about my car.  I know it's really out of my hands (and that is really killing me), but I know that I can't stop freaking out about it until I have it back!  All I want for my birthday is my car back.  That's it!  Just my little Toyota.  I miss it so much.  Okay, I wouldn't mind my own personal manslave that's really cute and has a soothing voice and pretty eyes for my birthday, too, but I know that isn't gonna happen :'( I just wish I could stop worrying but I can't.  I seriously think I am burning an ulcer into my stomach lining with all the fretting I've been up to lately.  I need to chill, but that takes money.  I NEED MONEY TO CHILL!!!! and money is part of the reason why I'm freaking out.  How am I going to afford this damn rental car?  I can't.  God, this is killing me!  I don't know what I can do...

      THIS IS TOTAL BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Why can't I just get my fucking car back?  This is fucking ridiculous.  With all the time and money I've wasted, I seriously wonder if I would have been better off buying a new car.  Seriously!  You would think my car would be done already, but NOOOOO!  I'm waiting for a fucking headlamp to come in.  On top of that I have to wait for the fucking insurance company who has been giving me nothing but the runaround to send me a fucking check so I can get my car when it's finished.  Yeah, like that will happen in the near future.  This is absolutely ridiculous!  I can't afford this rental car.  I honestly can't I don't know what I'm going to do.  I seriously want to kill myself because I can't afford all this, and I NEED to eat, I NEED to pay my bills, I NEED to pay my rent so I can have a place to live, but I also NEED a mode of transportation so I can get to work and make the money to pay for all the things I need.  It's not like this city has a decent public transportation system either.  It would be different if they did because then I could just take the bus or train wherever I needed to be.  The hoops that I've gone through for my fucking car have been totally insane just because I made ONE mistake - ONE misjudgement.  Why does God hate me so much?  I mean, it isn't just all this... but it isn't like I've done anything to deserve this... but my life as a whole.  I have been pretty much alone my entire life with very, very, very few friends and nobody to love... or, actually, love me, because I have been in love, but the feeling has NEVER been returned.  I've never had any romantic, intimate contact with a man and it really bothers me.  Why do I have to live my life this way?  It isn't like I chose to be this way... I just wish that for ONCE in my life things would go okay.  I could be surrounded by people who love and appreciate me and I could have a special person whom I can adore and who will adore me in return.  I wouldn't have to worry about money because I would have enough to be comfortable, but not too much so that I don't lose touch with the world.  Things would go right and I wouldn't have to stress out or worry.  I would never be depressed because I would have everything that I need. I seriously think I'm going to kill myself.  Unless I can get more money, I don't know what I'm gonna do...

       urlLink Zladko �Zlad� Vladcik was to perform his very popular techno-ballad, �Elektronik � Supersonik�  I AM WORLD'S BIGGEST WASHED UP SUPERSTAR!!!!  God, this is hilarious.  You have to see it (even though  Jenny  didn't find it funny...)  Foreign music videos are the best.  I love how foreign music videos are so low budget.  I have to give Matt Sharp and his fellow former Rentals a huge nod in this department because of the oh-so-low budget "Friends of P." video, even going to the extent of creating this elaborate story of how they were some 1970's band from someplace in Eastern Europe, I can't remember the specific country... Middle Eastern music videos are the best too.  They all have these middle aged men with soul glo jeri curl 'fros and they only halfway button their shirts and they're so greasy and nasty, but they have these young, barely legal, beautiful women hanging all over them. Anyway, down with high budget, overly produced American music videos with beautiful/plastic people!  Bring on the Eastern European and Middle Eastern music videos!

      (Sorry Jen for being so mean in the last post.  I know you're going through a lot, but I was mad at you because you were being a bitch.  It's OK.  All is forgiven now.)  I feel so sick....

      I'm seriously beginning to regret my decision to move out here with Jenny.  I mean, yeah, I needed this.  I needed to get away from my parents because they were smothering me, but my life hasn't been any better since I moved out here.  At times, I think it's gotten worse. I hate my work.  Yeah, I know, I couldn't have possibly lived off of the cash I was making working two jobs, but it's not like I'm making a great deal of money here, either.  It's just that I don't feel like I'm being challenged enough and I'm quickly growing weary with boredom from this job.  At least the people here are for the most part nice. My personal life sucks as much as ever as I am still alone.  I don't have much for the friends department either as Dennis is not a very close friend and he has his own cronies on the westside to hang out with.  Jenny has been such a bugger to deal with for the last while.  I understand her situation is rough, but it's not good to be focusing on it 24/7 and it's beginning to bother me.  She's gonna read this too and get more pissed off at me than she already is because she's been taking everything so goddamn serioulsy lately.  She can't ever take a fucking joke.  Sometimes I think I'd have been better off if I just stayed at home.  I mean my sister can't take a joke, but at least she's hilarious when she gets angry and she gets over it rather quickly.  Jenny's been such a bitch lately, that I want to go home and get away for a while but I can't :'( She'll get over it, I hope.

      If it weren't for the fact that the internet has been down at my apartment, I would have been really worried because it's almost 2 and I hadn't heard from Jen until now.  You know, I never realized how dependent I was on the internet until last night. I seriously went crazy because the damn thing wasn't working. Using the computer seemed absolutely pointless because there was no internet. I wanted to look up directions to somewhere and couldn't because the internet was down (yeah, I know, it's called a map... I've heard of it...). Jen was uploading some songs onto the iTunes and there were no automatic song titles that appeared (God forbid she dig up her album jackets, look them up, and type them herself), we couldn't talk to family or friends who might have been online (because we can't figure out how to use a phone and we forgot how to write letters), amongst other things that seemed impossible, but we knew weren't really.   It's just really funny how we become dependent on these things that we truly could live without.

       #100     Anonymous age 7, St Mary's Cof E School, as originally posted on  urlLink counton.org .  In honor of my 100th post, here's some fun shit I pulled from  urlLink counton.org :  Australian cricketer Don Bradman needed only 4 runs from his final test innings to achieve an average of 100. He was dismissed on his second ball achieving an average of 99.94. A googol is a 1 followed by 100 noughts Sleeping beauty was woken by a prince after a 100 year snooze. Argus was a monster with 100 eyes in Greek Mythology. 100 is a square number: 10 x 10 = 100. Blue whales grow to 100 feet long. The common dolphin can have up to 100 teeth but people still enjoy swimming with them. 100 degrees Fahrenheit = 37.8 degrees centrigrade (Celsius). A hockey pitch is 100 yards long. 100 degrees centigrade is the boiling point of water. The Australian billygoat plum has 100 times more vitamin C than an orange. This is the richest natural source An ice hockey rink is 100 feet wide and 200 feet long. Balmoral Castle, where the royal family reside in Scotland, is 100 feet high. The average annual rainfall in Bangladesh is 100 inches. The highest face values British coin is the £100 22 carat gold Britannia, first issued in 1987.  Anyway, I just couldn't wait for my 100th post. I think I'm going to make a cake now in honor of it!

      1 to go 'til 100, not as if you really cared.  Yeah, so, I've been really bummed lately.  I just feel like shit.  Underappreciated.  Unnoticed.  Unlikable.  Miserable.  Insert similar adjective here.  I mean, I beat myself up enough alone to make myself feel like shit, I don't need to deal with incredibly rude people on the phone all day to make me feel worse.  I've had a realization today.  Actually I've had this realization before, but I reminded myself of it today.  I am a worthless sack of shit.  Nobody wants anything to do with me.  Nobody cares.  I will die alone and miserable.  I will not have done anything with my life because at the rate I am going I will never rise above where I'm currently at in my career or lack thereof.  Nobody will ever love me because I don't fit anybody's picture of beauty (and don't even start with that "I'm not attractive because I'm a skinny, nerdy, cute brunette" bullshit like I know you will start with because you're wrong, men find you quite attractive and you could have a fucking boyfriend if you fucking wanted it.  People talk to you.  They don't talk to me.  Nobody wants anything to do with me, and going out wouldn't make one damn bit of difference because they'd all be huddled around you and I'd just be your fat friend and nobody would give me the time of day.) I mean I might as well just give up on everything.  Life is so pointless anyway.  We're born, we work, we die.  That's it.  I don't feel as if there is any reason for me to go on anymore.  Maybe I'm just in a funk, but I've been wandering through the tunnel for a very long time now, and I still don't see any light.
