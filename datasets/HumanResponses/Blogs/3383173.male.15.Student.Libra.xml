      God damn these worthless humanoid scum! They feel as if they own everything, as if they're perfect. They think like they're God himself! And they even gang up on Sakura... Getting little Ryuzuki here mad as hell, and I don't want to see what happens to those guys if ever Ryuzuki meets them... Bloody... It's going to be too bloody for my tastes... Poor guys... Hope you had a happy life messing up someone else's! Cause your puny pathetic excuse for a life is going down the drain I like to call Ryuzuki's anger... Sure, he can take his anger and shut it in a very big room, leaving him sane for about two years... Well, he's been keeping his anger in for over five years now, and he's telling me he's going to let it all out, but this time, not on some unfortunate piece of wood, but on a lucky guinea pig who likes to mess with his sister's "peaceful" life. So, good luck, whoever you are, you lucky bastard... You get to feel Ryuzuki's cold-blooded anger first hand... I envy you, really, I do... But I don't think I will after I see the results...  Sakura, don't stop Ryuzuki on this one, Sese, don't even think about helping Ryuzuki on this one, and as for Taka, Tyr, and Lady Oria, please do as he says, and keep out of it.  You'd best look at the fire (blood) works... And hope you have enough detergent to scrub off the blood that's going to fly your way...   -Kazeshi (As named by Ryuzuki)

      Ahh… I’m back. How did you guys like Ryuzuki? He’s been pretty persistent with his apologies. Cowardly wimp! My dear Sese, don’t misunderstand what I said. I did not and will not target special Nepher. I merely tried to tell her that she’s the only one who can prevent Ryuzuki from snapping and bringing my destructive fury into life. I didn’t mean for her to get hurt, however and whenever it may have happened. I’m sorry if you thought I’d hurt her. I am the angel of death, I admit countless men and women have died at my hands, but I am always accompanied by justice. I do not strike down those who are innocent, no matter how mad I am at them. I guess that just got stronger with Ryuzuki’s feelings towards Sakura. As for Tyr, Ryuzuki asked a little favor from him which I approved of, if ever I get out of control. Tyr will do all that it takes to stop me, because right now I know of only three entities besides Ryuzuki who can control me: you, Tyr, and Oria. I’m actually happy that Ryuzuki was open enough to share his body with me.  By the way, Sese, why did you forget about me? (Well, I never gave you my name before, so that might have been my fault.) I never knew you’d take Sese as your name in this lifetime.   It’s ironic that the twins get us as their reincarnated guardians. Honestly, I like protecting this kid, no matter how wimpy or cowardly he might be. He’s quite intelligent when he wants to be, and he already has good morals for his age. Although when his dad dies, he’ll be the last living person on this earth who has the capacity to become me, the angel of death, incarnate. I’m training him already, although at times your ward gets into the way of his training, but I have to admit, without her, he’d already be dead a month ago .  I missed you, Sese. I miss those days when we worked together as partners. Queerly enough, Sakura told Ryuzuki that you were reawakened by these little tidbits I can generate by tapping into Ryuzuki’s body. Did you really forget me? Maybe we’ll just find out when we talk tomorrow. I’m sorry if Ryuzuki seemed too worthless when you talked to him a while ago, I’ll make up for that. He sometimes forgets his manners around someone he supposedly knows very well.  Did I mention just how special this kid is? He’s been favored by my two sisters, the angels of life and live, and he’s blessed by the Egyptian god  Ra . If you don’t believe me, ask him to show you his right hand when you talk to him. If you can still read katakana, you’ll find something very interesting on his hand. He’s constantly in good health, and he never gets hurt by love. Besides, he already found Sakura. According to him, he doesn’t care if he never gets someone he can call his own, as long as Sakura is there. He cares a lot for her, and I don’t want to hurt him or Sakura because of that. Ask him yourself, if you wish. He actually does things he’d never to with other girls with her, like sing, try to dance, and show her just how much he really tries at stuff. Don’t worry about her getting hurt by him or me, since I can’t hurt her or you, and you know that. I’m really sorry if you thought I would hurt her, even in my full glory I will not try to. I am still of God, and as long as you both are, you can expect me to protect you instead of hurting you.   (Shi wa Tenshi)

       This is Ryuzuki. Nepher, I’m sorry about this, but I have to do it.     O celestial bathed in blood, Cloaked in eternal darkness, Special messenger of God, Save me from my abjectness.  You who has a name unknown, Your wings, coated pale crimson, My one life I disown, Let me be God’s special pawn.  Reincarnated in me, Not showing yourself clearly, I do wish for this truly, Show us your ferocity.  Your hair colored silver-blue, Eyes filled with a golden hue, Strength? No one has any clue, And mine you will just renew.  I invoke your just mercy, Lend me some strength to complete, My journey towards the sea, And whatever other feat.  Holy strength, pour unto me, So I become death, truly, Guest to all in misery, With blessings from only He.   I’m really sorry. I needed to do it to protect you. But look on the bright side, I’m not suicidal anymore! Although some morbidity will start flowing into me, giving me strength not from this world. By the way, please tell Sese that I’m sorry, and she won’t have to fight me anymore. I’m not bringing my other side out anymore anywhere, since I just completed the chant to intertwine my life with his. The moment I die, he dies as well. But, I’m no longer human. I’m a mix of human and spirit, if you will. You’ll start to hear from my other side at times, but this time I’m controlling him. I won’t make the same mistake any more. I won’t hurt you any more, but I’d rather protect you from myself. Actually, if you wouldn’t get hurt at it, I would have cut all my connections with you, to protect you from me, so as to avoid a happening like my blog post. I’ve stepped off the edge; I’m no longer pure Ryuzuki. My body won’t jerk up anymore, and I got rid off my bloodlust, but now I’m no longer human. Would you be able to accept me being like that? Or will you shun me into exile? I really didn’t know what to do besides this. I’m sorry.  Tyr, if Jon told you or you found out already, please grant my one and only request to you. But don’t tell either Sese or Sakura about this, since they’ll both do something to stop us. That favor is all I ask. By the way, from my other side: I’m sorry that I forgot that part.

      This guy is getting on my nerves. He won't even let me tell him the start of the prayer. Who does he think he is? He's nothing without me. I'm the only entity keeping him from dying at everything he does. Not to mention he's too suicidal. Although in this one I have to thank that twin sister of his. She keeps him in check at everything he does, and she won't let him commit suicide. To think she'd cry at the mere thought of him dying. This is getting very complicated. If I keep her out of the way, this guy just might kill himself before he lets me out, and I can't let that happen. But, if I keep her with him, I won't get many chances at getting out, although his health is guaranteed. Hmm... Very doubtful indeed. Not to mention this new girl, another "sister" of his. This is getting very complicated indeed. Although I can count on the new guy in this case, if he can get both girls away enough from my other self, my other self would get really depressed, and he just might let me out to ease his feelings. I can understand this guy, actually, to think you've been hiding your true feelings for a very long time from everybody, out of fear. He needs my power, I know it, but he doesn't want to be given the power at all. Is this what people call humanity? That humans do the most stupid things just because it's already part of their personality? Or is it because of these two girls in his life?   Before all else, I have to tell his twin sister this: Even though I don't like you much, I don't hate you. I also appreciate what you're doing for this guy, even though he may be too much of a wimp. Actually, miss, he won't tell you this in person, so I have to tell you instead: he needs you in his life. He can't live for long knowing he broke a promise with you, especially if it's about an arranged meeting. I just have a suggestion for you, if ever he needs to bring out his feelings, don't stop him. It'll only hurt him more. Trust me on this, I know what happened, since he nearly killed that classmate of his when someone tried didn't try to stop him. So you really have to pick, hurt this guy, or let him take all his anger out on some poor, unfortunate soul that he's going to sacrifice to me. And in this one, there are no middle options, well, except that you start crying in front of him, which'll make him snap back into consciousness, but he'll get really vulnerable. So you actually have three options, stop him forcefully (I don't see how you can do that), make him stop by crying (A not so bad, but not really good option), or let him kill his enemy (The best option so far since he gets stronger as he taps more and more into my power). In the end, when he kills enough, his spirit will die, and mine will control his body, and I'm preparing you who are so important to him for that. There will come a time when I will take control of this body, like now, while I'm typing this true statement up, but that time will be when he no longer has control over his killing instinct. I hope you haven't noticed yet, but he's getting there. Finally! After fifteen long years I get to live completely free! And that period will be marked by the death of his father. The moment his father dies, I take control. It's a good thing I'm implanting all these thoughts of hate in his mind.   It's even better if he kills his own father over someone, say, his twin sister? Ironic, isn't? You destroy your own flesh and blood for someone who's not even related to you, just because the person's your "soul mate." Beautiful the way love works. I benefit a lot out of this love. Just because I made my guy think that he's not loved by anyone, not even his precious sister. Ahh... I'm going to love working this body out. Not to mention the guy has knives in his closet, sharpened fully. It's a good thing he's getting into karate, then maybe I'll persuade him into ninjutsu, and, hmm... Maybe koppo as well. Please don't misunderstand this, I am not evil. I'm just sarcastically taking pleasure in the pain of others. Especially the pain of my guy. The more pain he feels, the more pleasure I get. It's actually a good thing his twin sisiter came into his life, at least he wouldn't just go get himself killed, just because he doesn't want her to cry for him. Really funny the way my sister's mind works, right? She gets a guy to like a girl, sure, not the normal infatuation situation she often sets my guy up on, gets it to the point that he treats her as more important than himself, and as such, with my other sister's help, convinces him not to commit suicide. Then, we make him believe that the love is one sided, until he gets really depressed. When he's depressed, sure, he'll think about suicide, but then he'll think about this twin of his, and stops. So what's his other alternative? He needs to kill someone, but he can't kill himself, he won't kill his twin sister, and he doesn't like his dad much. It's basically a hundred percent sure win for me, although that twin sister of his just has to prove to him that she really loves him as well, and this plan goes bye-bye, then I'll have to wait for another opportunity. What do you guys think?  (Shi wa Tenshi in sarcastic mood)

      Ahh... God is good! This body isn't perfect, yet it's good enough. It's kinda light, lithe, strong, supple, and it only needs training, then it can fit my likes. I'm still chained up. This guy just doesn't give up! He's still chaining me up inside his mind, just because he's afraid to hurt his twin sister. I'll wait for some time, although I might have to let him taste my power for him to allow me to come out. He nearly unchained me when he almost killed his classmate with a little rock, and that was when he was just in grade two. Oh well, instance wasted. I think I was still groggy then. But now that I'm awake, this girl steps in and helps her twin brother chain me up. Maybe I should teach him a little prayer to give him some power. I'll think it up first. For now, that's all, and again, Watashi wa  Shi wa Tenshi !
