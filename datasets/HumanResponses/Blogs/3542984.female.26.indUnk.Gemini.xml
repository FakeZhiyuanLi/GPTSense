      I may very well have stumbled upon a new addiction with this knitting thing.  I have my bag with the makings of my kitty hat sitting at my feet, and I have started to pick it up more than once, only to think better of it.  I have no problem knitting at lunch after my walk, but if I were to be caught knitting during working hours, that would probably be a Bad Thing.  Instead, I'll sit here and write about it.  One of the criteria for my next job may very well be a public transportation commute so that I can knit on the way to and from work.  I just don't have any time to knit now!   Progress pics coming soon...

      I didn't have any good Diva or Go-Go pictures from the digital camera, but thought I'd put some more kitty pics up today anyway (since I have no new knitting pictures).  Isabelle on the windowsill (above the kitchen counter...  bad kitty )    Finnegan on the counter above the fridge (he had to jump on the counter to get up there, so I guess he's a bad kitty, too)

      Took the purrsonality quiz at  urlLink www.catchow.com , and here are the results for my fabulous felines:  Isabelle is... The Diva  Confident and, at times, condescending, this cat dictates the terms of your relationship.  Finnegan is... The Go-Go  Frenetic and fun, this cat always has places to go, people to see, and toys to play with.  It's true!

      I'm a few rows into my kitty hat, and this whole knitting on circulars thing is much more involved than garter stitch!  It's not overly-challenging, I guess, but I'm working on much smaller needles than before, and I'm doing seed stitch, so it takes a  little  more concentration than the scarf.  It's going pretty well, though.  I managed to dig out the center end of yarn for the hat, which I hadn't managed to do for my scarf, so the yarn skein hasn't been rolling around as much... and the kitties haven't been attacking.  I guess that's good, but I kind of miss them pulling at the other end of the yarn!  I'm glad I still have some ends to weave in on my first scarf, because that's a very easy task that doesn't require much thought, and it's easy enough to just pick up and do if I only have a minute or two free.  I think that once the scarf is completely done, I'll start the Coney Island Fireworks scarf from SNB for my sister-in-law, for Christmas, because I like having more than one project to work on.  I just bought the yarn for that this weekend... at a very nice yarn store!  This past weekend, Ben and I made a trip to a different yarn store for these next projects of mine.  This store was so much nicer than the other yarn store I'd been to.  What I liked about it was that it was big enough that they didn't feel the need to know exactly what you wanted to buy, but they were there if you needed help.  I like that kind of store much better, in general.  I'm really enjoying knitting.  I actually had a major decrease in spending for the month of June, which I attribute to this new hobby.  I think the spending is down because I have one or two purchases of yarn (not including the intial needle stocking) for the month, then the actual knitting keeps me busy (and keeps me from shopping for "fun"). Yea, knitting!

      Finally, the last stitch is in place for my very first knitted scarf.  Yea!  Today at lunch I'm going to weave in the ends, and this weekend I'm going to block it.  I think that'll be necessary because you can see the progression of my knitting skills through the scarf, so hopefully I can make the beginning look more like the end.  It'll be an exercise in blocking, if nothing else.  When all is done, I'll have to put a picture up so that I can forever memorialize my accomplishment.  Hooray. :)  I'm excited to start a new project, and this time I'm not going to contain myself to just one thing at a time, especially if I'm making something like a scarf or blanket...  Can't wait.

       urlLink Previously , I wrote about an encounter where a woman at the airport approached me and asked how I got knitting needles through security.  It turned out that I wasn't flying and hadn't gone through security, but her comment made me think that knitting needles would probably be classified as a potential weapon.  Silly me.  Out of curiosity, I looked at TSA's website today, and found, on the list of  urlLink Permitted and Prohibited Items , that knitting and crochet needles are listed as PERMITTED for both carry-on and checked luggage.  Ho ho!  Of course, this is subject to the discretion of the security screener who may, in fact, deem knitting needles to be a "dual use" item, i.e. items that are seemingly harmless but may be used as weapons.  Can't disagree with that.    I fly rather infrequently, so this is not really an issue for me, but if I would have known this sooner, I might have knowledgeably said to the woman who asked that knitting needles were technically permitted on the plane.  Maybe I could have even produced the list of permitted items.  Too late for that now.

      I'm almost done my scarf.  I decided to use up the rest of the yarn to make it as long as possible.  Then I'll weave in the 50,000 ends I have, and block it.  I'll have to make sure that's the right order to do those things in... weaving or blocking first?  My husband Ben and I were looking at the scarf last night and he pointed out that I've gotten better.  The first sections are looser and willy nilly, and the most recent sections I've done are much tighter looking.  That's a good sign, I'd say.  I've been thinking about what to do next.  We're going to visit another local yarn store this weekend and check that place out.  I want to get yarn for the Kittyville hat from SNB.  I also have two jumbo skeins of Red Heart in gray that I was thinking about making the Ribbed for Her Pleasure scarf with, but now I'm kind of scarfed out, so I'm thinking either Zeeby's Bag or maybe even a tank or a hat...  We'll see.  I've decided that my sister-in-law would be the perfect recipient of the Coney Island Fireworks scarf, so that may be on my Christmas gift list.    Lots of ideas, and just from the SNB book.  I know there are countless patterns out there, and maybe if I saw a magazine I'd pick it up, but I'm trying to just stick with the one book for now until I run out of things I want to make.  At home, we have dozens of cookbooks, all purchased because they had good recipes in them.  They rarely get used.  I don't want to have a shelf-full of unused knitting books, and there's nothing specific I'm dying to make that I need a pattern for, so I'm not going to build an entire library just yet.

      Judging by the proportion of knitting to non-knitting material on my regular blog, I felt the need to make a whole new knitting (and cat) only blog. And here it is. Welcome!   Can't make too many promises on the  quality  of knitting content, since I'm such a beginner, but I'll do my best.   Update:&nbsp; Once upon a time, I had another blog,&nbsp;covering my daily happenings.&nbsp; Having started knitting and blogging at the same time, my blogging turned out to be mostly about knitting, but not enough to call it a knitting blog, per se.&nbsp; One day (June 23) I decided to split my blogs and have an everyday blog and a knitting blog.&nbsp; Only, the everyday one wasn't as much fun anymore, and I found myself mostly complaining about work, so I didn't want to do that anymore.&nbsp; Eventually, I got rid of the other blog and just kept this one.&nbsp; The point: posts prior to this one were lifted from the other blog, though I have just updated and taken out broken links. -L, 7/21

      We stopped at Ben’s parents’ last night to give his dad a Father’s Day present. I am so glad Father’s Day is over now. February through June are filled with non-stop birthdays, holidays, and appreciation days for me, and frankly, I’m sick of it. Now at least I get a reprieve for a few months. While visiting the ‘rents, I asked Mum if she had any old knitting books. She saves everything, so I knew if she ever owned one, she’d still have it. She used to do cross stitch, so she did, in fact, have a couple of “needlecraft” books from 1969 and 1981, which included knitting. I was hoping for vintage patterns, but these are more like textbooks. They’re good for reference, though, and I guess there are a couple patterns, but nothing I think I’d want to make.   I think that as soon as I finish my first scarf, I’ll start the kitty hat from Stitch ‘N Bitch, and maybe even something else at the same time, if the mood strikes me. I didn’t want to start something else while doing the scarf because I was afraid I’d never get back to the scarf to finish it, and I do want to be a knitter who completes projects. Knitting is looking like it’s going to be more expensive than I’d thought. Like any hobby, it’s going to take money, but I was even thinking of the Snowball Cat Bed and how much the yarn costs for that. This might be good for me, though. I’m the type of spender who makes $30 purchases all over the place until her credit card bill comes in at $1500. “Beware of small expenses; a small leak will sink a great ship,” Benjamin Franklin said. (Or he said something relatively similar, but I cannot find any agreement between the quotes posted on the internet.) I agree. I should tattoo it on my receipt-signing hand. My point here is that I can spend, spend, spend until the bill comes and then get that sick feeling from having spent so much, or I can make bigger purchases – like yarn for projects – that make a deeper impression in my mind, keeping me from making any more “small” purchases. Or I can just get a better job that pays more, and then I won’t have to worry about such nonsense.

      I have pictures of my Stitch 'N Bitch bags today.  Yea!  My first real sewing project!  Too fun.         Both fabrics came from Jo-Ann.  The blue one is actually a 1940s reproduction called "Granny's Feed Sack."  I wanted an old picture to put on that one, and Ben wound up bringing me a vintage postcard from France, so that was perfect.  It's actually a Champagne ad.  I found the Hawaiian pic on the internet...  I guess that's that.  Yea me!

      Good morning, Sunshine!  What a beautiful weekend – plenty of sun (so rare in Pittsburgh!), low humidity, and no rain (we are currently at 7 inches above normal for the year).  G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S!  If I seem like I’m in a better mood than I normally am, it’s because Ben is home.  Yea!  My mood improves tenfold when he’s back from a trip.  Right now, he’s at home, probably sleeping.  I think he averaged about 4 hours of sleep a night last week because of those three hour long European dinners that we Americans aren’t accustomed to.    The weekend was beautiful, as I said.  When I went out to get the paper Saturday afternoon (I’d been holed up in the house all morning), I was shocked at how nice it was outside.  I went back in, threw open all the windows, and went back out to work in the yard.  Inside, I got a ton of stuff done.  I made two DIY Totes from the Stitch ‘N Bitch book, and they ended up being fabulous (pics coming soon!).  I think this was my first actual personal sewing project.  I’ve done little things before, like pillows and things, and in my last apartment, I had big, marble windowsills, so I made fleece pads for Isabelle so she could look out the window in the winter, but this was actually my first project that I could bring out in public.  It wasn’t that bad, really and I’m very happy with them.  Anyway, I’ll talk about them more when I get the pics up.  Oh my, I just realized it’s the summer solstice and the days will be getting shorter after this!  It’s ok though; I really like fall and winter, and definitely love having four seasons to look forward to.  Um… what else?  Oh, I worked on the scarf Saturday night until my hands ached, while watching Breakfast at Tiffany’s for probably the 25th time.  The scarf is taking longer than I expected, and I still have lots to do to make it a useful length.  I really hope I don’t run out of yarn.  I showed Ben last night, and he really likes it, so that’s good, considering it’s for him.    Yesterday, when I went to the airport to pick Ben up, I brought my knitting (I was really excited to use my tote) and knitted in public for the first time.  I was so nervous!  One thing I noticed was that the energetic children bouncing on the seat next to me weren’t bothersome at all.  I know they would have been had I been reading.  Granted, I was only doing knit-knit-knit, instead of something complicated, so perhaps if I were doing something more complex, they would have bothered me.  They were really cute, though.  They must have been picking up their father.  The most adorable thing was that when he got his bag off the carousel, he opened it up and produced a gigantic jar of Nutella, and they were all very excited.  TOO CUTE.    Ben says that he was told by three different people last week that  knitting  =  biological clock ticking .  These three guys all said that immediately after their wives took up knitting, they started wanting to have children.  Could it be that my biological clock is telling me something?  I am 26… maybe it is nearly time.  I might take it as a sign that that little kids jumping around and screaming seem “cute” more than “obnoxious” to me these days.  Eek.  It's really not a big deal, because I've been wanting to start trying next year even before I started the knitting.  Also noteworthy about my airport trip: a woman, probably about my age, came up to me and asked how I got those “crochet needles” through security.  I told her that I was just picking someone up and didn’t go through security.  Satisfied, she went back to her companion and told him that.  Now, I should think that she was asking more for her personal safety than anything, considering she didn’t even know that they were knitting needles.  This makes me wonder.  I had visions of knitting on future plane trips to pass the time.  I hadn’t thought that the needles would be considered potential weapons.  It’s no stretch of the imagination, really, considering you could do a lot more harm with knitting needles than say, nail clippers, but still.  I hadn’t thought of it.  Ben suggested that I could hide bamboo needles on my person when I walked through security, but I would feel awfully suspicious appearing on the plane with these potentially deadly weapons.  And what if I got singled out for the full search?!  It would be like I was trying to sneak them on the plane with ill intent.  Ever the James Bond enthusiast, he also suggested I make a pair that consist of several pieces that can be screwed together; that way they would go unnoticed by the screener.  Still, I would have to put them together at some point, and I’d be nervous that I’d get in trouble, or worse, that they’d be confiscated.  So, I guess I’ll just have to do without.  Hrmph.  Well, my neighbor down the hall (at work) is doing his Monday morning nail clipping, which irritates me to no end, so I'd better take a walk.

      My mother actually giggled last night when I told her I’d taken up knitting. She asked if I was knitting baby booties. I said no, a scarf. She said she thought I might be knitting baby things. I said perhaps I might be soon, as I just talked to my brother this week and he said he and his wife were planning to start trying in a couple months. That was news to her, but she quickly recovered, mentioning the little secret I had told her about during The Great Memorial Day Incident of 2004 (that incident being the one where I drank approximately 3 made-from-scratch, no-filler margaritas in the hour in which my guests (aka boths sets of parents) arrived). Oh, right, that secret. It seems that when I was in the midst of my drunken stupor (the last drunken stupor I ever plan to have, thank you very much), my mom and mother-in-law came in to check on me and I told them I had a secret. I told them that I wanted to get pregnant within the next year, or sometime next year. That must have unleashed their grandmotherly instincts because my mother-in-law emailed me first thing the next morning with the names she wanted the baby to call her and Ben’s dad. And my mother has taken up giggling.   I can’t remember for the life of me what grandmother name my mom-in-law picked… I remember she wanted “Ap” for Ben’s dad… I’d better remember, or I’ll be in trouble. My competitive mother didn’t seem too thrilled when I told her Mum already picked her g-mom name, but then she kind of remembered Mum telling her that, and she thought it was an unusual name that she didn’t want, anyway. Tragedy averted.   That reminds me… I found this good baby name site a while back. It’s at  urlLink www.namenerds.com . Navigation of the site isn't very intuitive, but if you dig, there's a lot of interesting info (an article on middle names, strange names from baby books, and Irish names for people, pets, boats and houses, among other things). I found this when looking up the meaning of the name Finnegan, after we had been calling our new cat that for about a month. According to this site, Finnegan means “little white haired one.” How perfect is that? (Finnegan is a black cat, in case you haven’t noticed.)   I’m going to refer my mother to this site because it has a section on alternative grandparent names. Looking at it just now, I saw this personal account:     Auntie-Gramma:  because I married my stepmother's brother and we bred (LOL). So now my stepmother is both an aunt and a grandma.  LOL indeed.   Some of my other favorites are Muffer and Pawsey. Perhaps I’ll suggest these to my mom for her and dad. Heh.   I personally like when grandparent names evolve from spontaneous mispronunciations from the mouths of little ones. They sound cute, and they stick. I think that picking your own cutie grandparent moniker kind of takes the meaning out of it. But hey, that’s just me.   TTFN

      I could not get moving this morning. I got up all right, but I kept procrastinating when it was time to leave for work. Finnegan was in at 2:00 this morning. It may have been thundering, though I was too out of it to be sure. I put him in the hall and shut the door. At some point, I had a terrible nightmare, where I was sitting in a bar/restaurant with Ben and a bunch of random people from days past and they were telling me how the night before, I got so drunk that I started tap-dancing on the bar, topless. *shudder* I didn’t remember any of it, but I was really upset to hear this in the dream (as I should have been!) At least the actual tap-dancing part wasn’t in the dream. Ugh. Then, somehow Finnegan’s mewing got into my dream, but I can’t remember how it factored in, only I do know that it wasn’t him in the dream, it was a person talking or something. Finally, I woke up and realized that he really was mewing because I had already put him out of the room, and that it was time to get up.   Last night, I went to the  urlLink mean-lady yarn store  that I had been to last week because when I was there before, I picked up a couple random skeins of clearance yarn that I liked. I had no idea what I would do with them, but I realized that I didn’t get enough to make anything that I know of, so I thought I should go back and see if she still had more of the same. The one is a really pretty green yarn (can’t remember what it’s called), and the other was a couple skeins of Wendy’s Peter Pan Velvet Touch in light blue and mint green. I didn’t really want to lose the time it was going to take to go there, since it’s not on the way home, but I thought it would be worth it in case she still did have the same yarn. When I got there, I was flustered because as soon as I parked, some guy had just walked up and was standing at the back of my car, on a cell phone. I thought of all those ridiculous email forwards my mother-in-law sends me about women getting attacked at their cars… I grabbed my work bag because I wanted to bring my Stitch &amp; Bitch book in to make sure I got the right needles for the Kittyville hat that I will one day make. It was raining, and I didn’t want my precious book to get wet. I also grabbed my cell phone to pretend I was talking to someone to try to deter this possible madman from attacking me. (I’m paranoid, by the way.) Got in the store and Mean Lady was there. Only, she almost nice this time. She asked what I wanted, I told her about the clearance yarn, and she remembered exactly what I’d bought – last week! Either it’s not a very busy store, or she’s really not as mean as I thought. Still undecided. It was clear that she wasn’t going to let me just browse (because I was carrying a bag?), so I told her which needles I wanted and she explained to me why I needed circular needles and double-pointed needles and about the importance of checking my stitches to make sure none were twisted. That was nice of her… I wanted the bamboo circular needles because I took that What Kind of Knitting Needles Are You? quiz and it said bamboo (am I really this flaky?), but then she kind of pushed the plastic double-pointed ones on me, even though they were only $0.70 less than the bamboo. I didn’t argue because I realized I didn’t have a sound argument for the bamboo needles, and after the cat blanket incident…   Oh, I forgot to mention the cat blanket incident. Well, while we were standing at the clearance yarn bin, we found three skeins of that green yarn I liked. She asked what I was going to do with them, and I said I wasn’t sure, maybe make a cat blanket. I was just brainstorming here, but her mouth nearly dropped open.  A what?  she asked. Oh, you know, a blanket for my cats. I tried to explain how they sit on top of the couch and I already have a throw there but maybe a green knit blanket would be nicer. She didn’t comprehend.  Not a scarf?  Green’s not really my color, but I like the yarn, I said.  Hm , she said. I did  talk her  into  letting me  buy all three skeins, though she seemed to think I should only buy one. What the heck kind of store is this where they don’t want you to buy stuff? No wonder she doesn’t get many customers. Honestly, I got the impression that because I’m a beginner, she didn’t to sell me anything because it would just be wasted on me. Paranoia…  or Truth ?   Finally, I was ready to check out and I realized I left my purse in the car with all the fuss about the madman and the book getting wet. She let me use her umbrella because it was pouring raining at this point, so that was nice. At the very end, in an attempt to be friendly, I told her that if I ever wound up making anything with the green yarn, I’d let her know (as if to imply that I’d be back). The look she gave me… My goodness. Was it the “if I ever make anything” part? We’ll never know.   I think I’ll buy my yarn online from now on.       You are bamboo.  Warm, cozy, and thoughtful, you take your time and enjoy how things feel, smell, and taste. You love the craft and beauty of traditional things, and you value the comfort and experience of knitting as much as the results. But while you are reveling in your warm cozies, don't get stuck. Warm is wonderful, but so is the whole wide world!     urlLink  What kind of knitting needles are you?    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      The scarf is coming along nicely.  It’s not at all what I expected, though.  The pattern called for a super-bulky yarn.  After dinner on Friday, Ben and I had some time to pick stuff up at Target for his trip.  I had looked for a non-Michael’s/non-Jo-Ann yarn store in that area, and found one listed, though I wasn’t sure exactly where it was.  Lo and behold, as we were driving from the restaurant to Target, we found ourselves face to face with the yarn store.  It took forever to find a parking spot, and it was raining, but we succeeded in getting there.  We went into the store, my first experience with a real yarn store, expecting to find some cheerful knitter who was eager to share her collection of yarn with me, maybe with a wistful look in her eyes as she recalled her first knitting project.  Instead, we were greeted with a gruff, semi-unhappy person who gave the impression that customers were not welcome in her store.  I don’t even know if she was the owner, but I wasn’t impressed with her demeanor, to say the least.  She showed us the bulky yarns she had, and left us to decide.  We mulled over our choices for a while, not willing to part with $60 for my first scarf, not wanting anything too itchy, and trying to find something in colors Ben would be happy to wear.  We did end up finding something reasonably priced that we thought would be nice.  Last night, I started the scarf.  It’s just a garter stitch the whole way through, with four blocks of three colors each.  I cast on my ten stitches and knitted 14 rows.  Yay me.  The thing was only supposed to be 5” wide, and it pretty much was, but I realized that 5” isn’t very wide for a winter scarf for Ben.  I looked at the pattern again.  The author said the skein she used/suggested was 100g, 45 yards.  I looked at mine:  100g, 110 yards.  Okay, I thought, that means that I have more yarn and can start over to make it wider.  I pulled my first piece apart, trying to keep the cats away all the while, and started over, this time casting on 16 stitches.  As I was knitting, I realized that 100g must be the weight of the whole skein, not some measurement of bulk. (I’m a little slow sometimes.)  Hence, my yarn is about half the bulk of the one recommended.  Well, I didn’t want to start over with smaller needles, and I certainly didn’t want to run out of yarn, so I decided to just keep going with what I have.  It doesn’t look like the picture; it’s a little holy, but I still like it.  And it is my first project, so this will be a lesson to me to realize the importance of buying the correct type of yarn if I want the project to look like the picture.  The cats were okay, for the most part.  I told Finnegan that he wasn’t allowed to play with this yarn, and he understood.  At one point, Isabelle was being a total sweetheart, sitting right next to me on the sofa, watching the yarn go up to my needles.  Until she attacked said yarn.  Not such a sweetheart, after all.   I only got 14 rows done because it was nearing 10:30 and I still had to feed the cats and get ready for bed, which somehow takes me at least 30 minutes.  I did want to do the next color, but I was too tired anyway.  So, I went to bed, and within minutes I was joined by a kitty.  This was most unusual, as Isabelle has never slept in the bed while we have had another cat living in the house.  I was pretty sure it was Isabelle because this kitty was sleeping at the foot of the bed, and Finnegan would have slept on my pillow, and wouldn’t have done that until about 3 am.  I didn’t get up to look because I knew if it was Isabelle, any sudden movement would have made her leave.  She’s so fussy.  This morning, I learned that it was Isabelle, because at around 5:30, I heard Finnegan jump up and attack her.  She left and he came up to make sure I was awake.  Today, I looked on the internet and found one of the exact yarns recommended for the scarf, for only $12.99/skein.  I'm sure I didn't see that at the yarn store... I’ll remember that for next time.

      Worked on the scarf last night...  The book said if you used thinner yarn on bigger needles, it would be lacy. Lacy...  or airy ? I thought air pockets would be good. It would be warmer that way. I knitted my little heart out last night and got the scarf half done (my brother called to say happy b-day and then I had to call a friend back and spent over an hour on the phone with her, or else I may have gotten more done). I looked at the scarf. Definitely lacy. Lacy is not what I was going for. I'm not sure I like it now. I hate to give up halfway through my first project, but I think I might have to start over on smaller needles. This just won't do. I've been thinking about it, going back and forth between just finishing it and making the next one better, or starting over. I just don't want to start over and get frustrated and quit altogether. I don't really think that will happen, but it could... My plan now is to go ahead and start the scarf on smaller needles, leaving the original half-scarf intact. If the second one goes better, then I'll start pulling the first one apart for its yarn. I don't know what the best way to go about this is, but I'll take it as a beginner's lesson.

      I’ve officially taken up knitting.  As of last Sunday.  I tried it once before, using an online tutorial, but I never got comfortable enough with it to stay with it and create something.  Last weekend, I saw a book called  urlLink Stitch 'N Bitch , and it called out to me, asking me to buy it.  I did.  I’m a sucker for books with pretty covers. Currently, I’m knitting a swatch.  My first swatch – yay!  I’m maybe half done at the moment.   After that, I think I’ll move on to a scarf.    As far as the book goes, it’s fabulous.  It’s well written, easy to follow, and it’s really contemporary.  The author incorporates a lot of slang, which isn’t something I’d normally appreciate in an instruction book, but she does it in a way that makes it fun to read.  I give it 5 stars!  Plus, at the end, there are something like 40 patterns, all of which are quite modern, and there’s even a cat bed.  A cat bed!  Yay!    I try to do a few rows of my swatch each night.  I didn’t think the cats would really care, since that’s a cliché, right?  Cats and yarn, ha ha.  No, it’s true.  If I keep the ball of yarn on my lap while I knit, there’s no problem, other than the yarn getting all tangled in my needle, which actually is a problem.  Eventually, I toss the ball onto the floor so as to enjoy tangle-free knitting.  Finnegan’s eyes light up from across the room... he’s on it.  At first, I don’t notice anything going on.  He’s stealthy.  But soon, there’s a tugging at the ball end of the yarn... I look down, and there, below me, is a cat wrapped up in yarn.  Bad kitty.  I untangle him and wrap the yarn back up, which he doesn’t appreciate, as I’m spoiling his fun.  He sits and looks up at me, and I go back to work.  Within seconds, he’s attacking my needles!  Oh, Finnegan.  He finds the ball again and gets back to work on his own project.  The next time I take the ball away, he attacks my foot.  (I blame Ben for this one because I’m wearing white socks and when we first adopted Finnegan, Ben would dangle my white socks in front of him like prey.  Tsk.)  Eventually, Finnegan leaves, but within minutes, Isabelle comes over and is batting at the yarn herself.  Defeated, I pack up and go to bed.  Finnegan Knits

            He was born October 13, 2003 (or so we have decided based on his relative age).   We adopted him in March 2004.   He’s black with orange-yellow eyes and weighs about 12 pounds.   His name means “fair” or “little white haired one.”  We found that out after we named him.   He doesn’t mind having his paws played with, but he hates to get his nails clipped.  Nail clipping comes with hissing and growling and spitting and biting and yowling – even at the vet’s office.  We could never take him to Petco for a nail clipping, because frankly, we don’t think they would do it.   He doesn’t like to be brushed.  If you try to brush him, he’ll bite your wrist, then attack the brush.  Then your foot.      Eating is his favorite activity.   After he eats, he drinks, then he cleans his eating area by digging the crumbs into a pile.   He constantly torments Isabelle, chasing/biting/ambushing her.  There’s no peace for the poor girl when he’s around.   He likes to play hide-and-seek.   He’s very playful and loves to run around the house.      He wakes us up every single night between 1am and 5am, just to visit.   He likes to get into just about everything, especially my knitting.      He likes to shred paper and chew on plants.      He doesn’t know litterbox etiquette; he digs and digs, but never in the right spot.  He’ll dig outside the litterbox, on the wall, on the rug, but never in the litter.   He’s extremely stealthy and clever.  He’ll wait for us to turn our backs then immediately go after Isabelle’s food.     He is the alpha cat in our household.   He can catch treats with his paws and put them in his mouth.   He likes to suckle fingertips.   He has a loud purr and a teeny-tiny little kitten meow.

      I'll bet you thought I forgot all about the Snowball Cat Bed from  SNB , what with all this poncho nonsense I keep talking about (saw another article in the paper this morning about ponchos. Must.Start.Poncho.)... but I haven't.  Last night, I finished the bottom, round part, of the cat bed.  Today I'll cast on for the sides, which I hope goes better than  urlLink casting on for the bottom  did. Oh yeah, and remember the part about me  urlLink running back to Michael's  to find more Fun Fur because I thought I wouldn't have enough yarn?  Yeah. Didn't need it.  Now I have an extra skein of citrus Fun Fur in the stash... which will be used in my next, surprise project: the frou-frou version of the bikini in  SNB !  Anyway, blah blah blah. What I'm trying to get at is that... Finnegan was lying on the round bottom part of the bed last night!  Hip-hip-hooray!  A cat that likes my knitted work. AND, I caught Isabelle playing with the kitty wonton.  My cats do love me, after all!

      Here's a closeup of the needles I made out of bamboo skewers.  The sparkly little poms on the end are miniature versions of the cat toys that my husband and I call "babies" because our cats will carry them around in their mouths like kittens.  So, they look a little silly, but they remind me of my cats when I knit with them, which makes me happy. :)  baby needles  urlLink

       urlLink Yesterday , I mentioned taking pictures of a cat toy named Mr. Bear. He's a few years old, as you can see, but he was the only model I could find for the  urlLink paper ponchos  I made the other day.  Since I have the pictures with me today, I thought I'd share.

      The home computer internet connection appears to be a lost cause.  Stupid software.  That has to be it.  We tried all night to get it to work, taking the advice of the virus & firewall software help guy I chatted with yesterday, but nothing worked.  Nothing.  There are a couple more things to try to night, but otherwise, it appears that we're going to have to reformat the whole thing.  Blast.    At least one good thing came of this -- we backed up all the digital pictures onto CDs and I brought my recent ones in, to, um, work... so I can upload them on my lunch break...    I ran into the office this morning to grab the discs and Ben said, "Good idea, Honey, so you know what we have."  It took me a second to realize what he was talking about, then I remembered I was going to to bring the internet security software in to talk to the help tech again today.  Oh, right , I thought... so I ran back into the office and grabbed those, too. Hee hee.   Last night, I finished my kitty wonton.  I made it a little bigger than the  urlLink pattern , because the pattern said the eggroll would be good for bigger kitties, but I wanted to make the wonton, and my kitties aren't super-small (8 and 12 pounds).  Anyway, mine doesn't look like a wonton. Not really.  Maybe it's the colored yarn, or maybe I just don't know how to fold a wonton.  And the cats don't like it.  Go figure.  Of course, I don't have pictures of the FO because they're still on the camera, but here is the wonton in progress.   urlLink

      I took tons of pictures last night -- pictures of my kooky skewer needles, Mr. Bear (cat toy) wearing a paper poncho, kitties behaving like kitties... only to find that I couldn't post them on the blog because our internet connection at home is out of commission.  Out. As in, not in.  I spent half an hour on the phone with a very polite young man from the DSL company who did his best to help, but alas, there was nothing he could do, as the problem is apparently not with the DSL, it is with something on our computer.  I won't name any names here, but  someone  was fiddling with the firewall/virus protection settings on Sunday night and now, the internet is not connecting.  I can't blame him, though, because that firewall stuff is beyond me, so I could just as easily have been the culprit, had I been fussing with it. Which I wasn't. Ahem.  Anyway, other than beating our heads against the computer for the better part of the evening, fruitlessly trying to coax the beast into granting us internet access, we did some shopping and stopped by Marshall's.  I saw a veritable stock of ponchos there.  Ponchos. At Marshall's.  I questioned myself...  if they're at Marshall's, are they still trendy?   "Of course," Marshall's would say, "of course they are, that's why they're at Marshall's," but I had to ask.  Then I remembered my advertising emails that I received just this week, from the big companies who market the trends to the masses, so I was comforted in feeling that I still had time to knit a poncho and wear it in public.    The good thing about seeing the ponchos at Marshall's was that I was able to try a few on to determine what style I would like and what style I would not.  Not a fan of the  urlLink little shawl-type  one that ties around the neck like Little Red Riding Hood.  When I tried that one on, I felt like a table at Grandma's house, covered with a big, pink doily.  Maybe it's because I'm short.  I'm sure on tall people, it would be better.  Maybe even on some other short people, just not me.  Anyway, I picked out a style to make, and it's the one I was thinking of making (like two rectangles sewn together), so that's good.  I showed Ben.  He was a little skeptical of these so-called ponchos I had been talking about.    He had pictured:    while I was thinking something more like:  urlLink   . urlLink     He insists I need to make a Clint-style poncho, but he's just kidding... right?  Regardless, we estimated the measurements of one that I liked so I wouldn't be flying blind when I try to knit this thing up.  Trip to LYS scheduled for Saturday morning.

      Even though Cape Mod from  urlLink Stitch 'N Bitch  was one of the first things that I wanted to knit from the book, I wasn't going to make a poncho because I thought it'd be passé by the time I got it finished, and because I've been trying to train myself to only buy classic items of clothing that I can wear for years to come.  But now I'm being conditioned into wanting one, thanks to emails with poncho links from the marketing fiends at  urlLink Urban Outfitters  and  urlLink Gap , not to mention the recent poncho discussion at  urlLink Yarn Harlot ...   I've been worn down.  I found myself sitting here at lunch designing mini ponchos out of little paper rectangles.    I think the trend is pretty new (at least in Pittsburgh, the last place on Earth to pick up a trend), so I expect it to hang on for at least a couple years, maybe with variations from season to season.  And, if I don't like it or get tired of it, I can always rip it out, right?  My plan is to make one in the style of the  urlLink Lux Popcorn Pointelle Double V Poncho  at Urban Outfitters.  Without the popcorn pointelle part, since I should get this done ASAP, for trend's sake.   LYS, here I come.

      Knitting is like reading a really good book... I just can't seem to put it down.  Even finishing the project is like a book.  After I'm done, I absorb the experience for a little while, then find another one to start.  So, I started a new project last night.     Last night, I picked up my homemade-from-bamboo-skewers size US 3 knitting needles and an old ball of yarn that I possibly purchased in high school for some crocheted baby blanket that I never made, and I started the  urlLink kitty wonton  from Knitty.  I'm liking it.  First, I'm liking my skewer needles because, you know, I made them out of kitchen supplies.  Second, I'm liking the project because the yarn is variegated and it's just plain pretty.  I've never knit with variegated yarn before, and it's a lot nicer looking than I thought.  This is really an interim project until I can get to the LYS to purchase some needles for my real next project, which I think will be  urlLink Shimmer , also from Knitty.  I'm not going to use Glitterspun for that, though, because I'm more of a glittery-at-holiday-time person than a glittery-year-round person.  So, we'll see.  I'm actually considering using something like Red Heart acrylic, bought on clearance, no less.  I'm living on the edge.  On a final note, my link for the day: one of the cutest cat pictures ever is  urlLink here .

      Now that I'm officially done with my slightly more complicated project (the kitty hat), all I'm left with is one, easier project (the cat bed)...  must...start...another...  But what?  I have this terrific green yarn that I bought on clearance at my LYS.  It's called CanCan by Zitron.  I think it might be discontinued because I'm having trouble finding it online.  Unfortunately, I only have 4-50g/~70yd balls.  I was hoping to make a sleeveless shirt out of it, because it would look great with a pair of black pants... but there's only about 280 yards.  All of the patterns I've seen call for at least 400 yards.  So, I'm wondering if I can somehow possibly make this yarn into a top suitable for everyday wear (i.e. not too skimpy that I wouldn't dare wear it out).  I considered buying another color of the yarn, which I found at one  urlLink store , but I'm having trouble envisioning stripes since the yarn itself is kind of speckled.  For the time being, I will gaze longingly at the yarn every time I see it beckoning from the shelf on which it now sits, until I find a pattern that calls for no more than 280 yards of yarn, or until I swatch a piece on large needles and find that I can squeeze a holy shirt out of this yarn.  If this doesn't work out, I do have a wedding to attend in three weeks, so I was thinking of whipping up (ha ha) a shawl for that... Maybe I should concentrate on that for now, especially considering the speed at which I currently "whip up" projects.  Ah, and I spoke to my mother this weekend.  She must have had a party last week because she said a co-worker friend of hers just took up knitting and sat in the corner and knitted the whole time (she did not say this in a derogatory way).  Sounds like something I would do.  Mom was enraptured with what I suspect was a novelty yarn that the lady was knitting with, by the way she described it.  I told her I made my SIL Amy a  urlLink scarf  with an eyelash for Christmas, but didn't think she (Mom) wore scarves... Mom said, oh, she would, if it were something like that.  So, next time I go to visit (my fam lives outside of Philly) we're going to go pick out some yarn for a scarf for her.  It's really better this way because she is very picky, especially about gifts, and I've learned over the years that it's best to just give her what she wants.  Plus, it sounds like she has already seen the yarn she wants (it's iridescent) and has her mind set on that.  So, another Christmas present on the list.  It looks like I'll be scarving my whole family this Christmas.

      Hooray for finishing my  urlLink third project !  This was the most challenging one I've done so far.  From this project I learned that I knit too tightly on circulars (I only used two skeins of yarn; the pattern called for 3), I like doing k2tog, and  urlLink pom-poms  aren't too hard, but they take a little time.  For the hat, I used Maggi Knits/Maggi's Merino Aran.  It's soft and warm, and very pretty.  Now, I just have to wait for winter. :)

      I thought for sure today that the cat bed project was doomed.&nbsp; First, I had all that trouble starting it, then today...   The other day, I was reading the band from the Wool Ease and saw a note that said Wool Ease prints have less yardage.&nbsp; No matter, I thought, I don't have Wool Ease prints.&nbsp; Then today, I realized that I  do  have Fun Fur prints.&nbsp; Could they have less yardage than the solid Fun Fur?...   Yes.   10 yards less!   This was a dilemma.&nbsp; I was convinced that this project was doomed.&nbsp; I decided that I'd go back to Michael's, where I got my first batch, to get more, and maybe look for the same lot number.&nbsp; But I bought that yarn almost two weeks ago.&nbsp; What were the odds that they'd have the same lot numbers now?&nbsp; I resigned myself to the fact that&nbsp;I'd have a multi-lot project and&nbsp;didn't get upset about it, since there's nothing I can do now, and plus, it is a cat bed, and I don't think either Isabelle or Finnegan would mind one way or the other.&nbsp;   Before I left for Michael's, I wanted to finish a few more rows to be at a good stopping point.&nbsp; I got to the part where I need 48 stitches.&nbsp; I counted.&nbsp; 47.&nbsp; There is no row in this pattern that should have 47 stitches.&nbsp; I looked all over for a dropped stitch.&nbsp; No sign of it, not to mention it's nearly impossible to find such a stitch in the midst of all that  fur .&nbsp; I closed my eyes and fought off the headache and the urge to give up this blasted project.&nbsp; I looked again.&nbsp; Found the dropped stitch and picked it back up.&nbsp; Hoo-rah.   Went to Jo-Ann for fleece for that itchy Scarf #1.&nbsp; Had a coupon and wound up paying only $1.75.&nbsp; Ass that I am, I didn't have any cash on hand, so I had to pay with credit card.&nbsp; The cashier joked that once she had a woman who&nbsp;put $0.31 on a credit card.&nbsp; I said that was probably me.&nbsp; I think it was.&nbsp; Ass, yes.&nbsp; Anyway, while there, I looked at their Fun Fur.&nbsp; Their lots were like 2 and 37.&nbsp; Mine is 1239/1 or something totally different like that.   Went to Michael's.&nbsp; To the Fun Fur.&nbsp; First lot I picked of Citrus: 1239/1.&nbsp; Can you believe it?&nbsp; The whole bin was my lot!&nbsp; And they had tons of my lot in the Indigo too.&nbsp; What are the odds?&nbsp; So, Fortune smiled on me today and told me that my project wasn't doomed, after all.   Here's the progress on the cat bed. Kind of looks like a toilet seat cover, doesn't it?   urlLink      But hey, look how it matches that rug!   And here's Finnegan, being totally uninterested in his future bed.   urlLink

       It was the last thought before I went to sleep and the first thought when I woke this morning: I'm going to&nbsp;rip out the cat bed and start over, again.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's uneven, and I don't like it.&nbsp; I had some trouble with an increase on that tight side.&nbsp; This is my first project with increases, and it kind of doesn't help that I have the eyelash to contend with (at least that's my excuse).&nbsp; So, I've decided it would be best to&nbsp;rip out now while I have only 8 rows, rather than let it continue to bother me through the next 8 or 16 or 32, then rip it out. &nbsp;   Last night, I looked again for that dishtowel book that a woman at work had given me.&nbsp; I know it should be on the bookshelf, but this time I even looked inside of other books.&nbsp; Still no sign of it.&nbsp; Would I really have gotten rid of it?&nbsp; Surely, not on purpose.&nbsp; While looking, I did rediscover a book that my mother-in-law had given me as a housewarming gift, called   urlLink  Confessions of an Organized Housewife   .&nbsp; I think she gave it to me more&nbsp;for the "organized" part than the "housewife" part.&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't read much of it, though I have glanced through.&nbsp; Overall, there doesn't appear to be&nbsp;any earth-shattering information in the book.&nbsp; It's comprised mainly of information on organizing the home, from Kool-Aid packets to yard tools.&nbsp; There's even a few recipes and schedule ideas.&nbsp; Last night, I looked to see what Ms. Schofield had to say on the topic of yarn.&nbsp;&nbsp;She said:      Skeins of yarn can be stored very decoratively.&nbsp; Open baskets full of yarn add a warm, charming look to a room.&nbsp; Or, hang up a wooden wine rack and store colorful skeins of yarn in each compartment.     Large, round cardboard ice cream cartons... can be stacked on their sides on a shelf and used as bins for extra skeins.    That&nbsp;wine rack idea was also&nbsp;on Wendy's   urlLink  Top 10&nbsp;Unusual Places&nbsp;to Store Yarn    list recently.&nbsp; Ms. Schofield would surely be proud.&nbsp; Not that I imagine the two suggestions are connected. &nbsp;   Well, onto ripping!

       Started the Princess Snowball Cat Bed from  SNB  today. At lunch, I had continuous interruptions, had to cast on at least three times, and only got 3 rows done. On the way home, I tried to work on it more and wound up with a tangle of yarn that took 40 minutes to undo. Started over tonight, and I think the left side looks a little tighter than the right (in the pic) but I'm sick of starting this thing, so I'm going to live with it and hope it fades away.    urlLink

       I think I did a week's worth of knit blogging last night, so much so, that I had no time left over to knit.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; I sense a problem... Though, I did manage to look some stuff up today about the way I was posting my pictures, and I think I found out how to do it more efficiently with Hello.&nbsp; This morning, I thought about putting all my bloggish pics into a place like     urlLink  photobucket.com   , but that would give me too much opportunity to do all this blogging from work, and I'm not sure that's a good thing... So for now, I'll do it from home, the hard way (or the easy way now, since I know more).    &nbsp;  Not that anyone has asked why, but looking over my past entries, I see a whole lot more pictures of Finnegan than Isabelle.&nbsp; Why, you may (or may not) ask? The answer is simple: Isabelle hates getting her picture taken.&nbsp; If she's doing something cute, or just looking sweet, I'll run for the camera (which I have learned to leave out), but as soon as she hears it turn on, she walks away.&nbsp;  Ha.   No more cuteness from me , she says.&nbsp; Also, since we've started using the digital camera, she's been a lot more squinty in the pictures.&nbsp; I think the flash may be brighter.&nbsp; So, the only way I can get a good picture of her is to make sure there's some sunlight coming in and get a nice closeup.&nbsp; I tell you, that cat is just a lot more work, all around.&nbsp; A diva, indeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finnegan, on the other hand,&nbsp;is willing to be adorable even when the camera is out, and he likes to get into  everything , which makes for&nbsp;an abundance of&nbsp;photo-ops.&nbsp; Hence, more pictures of Finnegan on the blog.

      This was supposed to be like the Beginner's Basic Scarf from   urlLink Stitch 'N Bitch  , but I used Reynolds Lopi and size 11 needles.  &nbsp;  Here it is, modeled by my wonderful husband, Ben:&nbsp;&nbsp;   urlLink      Ben says, "Please hurry; it's itchy." And it is. I tried conditioning it, but that didn't help, so I'm going to sew in a fleece panel some time between now and when the weather gets cold.

I  have  to make one for myself now.   urlLink      But, this one is a Christmas present for my sister-in-law, Amy, so I had to box it up.   urlLink    urlLink      My favorite Coney pictures:   urlLink   &nbsp;   urlLink       Thank you,   urlLink  Ellen   , for such a wonderful pattern!

       I rarely use bookmarks on my web browser.&nbsp; Instead, I memorize all the sites I visit and type them in by hand every morning (or every evening, if you happen to work at the same place as I do).&nbsp; Unfortunately, this can lead to trouble if I mistype an address.&nbsp; Mistypings&nbsp;can lead to  totally  unrelated sites (that I wouldn't want to be caught visiting at work, or at home for that matter), 50 screaming pop-ups, or something even more random...    &nbsp;  Today, I was trying to type in     urlLink  seweclectic.blogspot.com   , but instead typed   urlLink  seweclectic. logspot .com   .&nbsp; I would not have ever, ever guessed that "logspot" was an actual place on the web, or that Aarons Bible University had a home there.&nbsp; All I can say is, "Umm..."&nbsp; Once I get over that, I'll decide whether this is some type of  sign  for me.

       I finished the Coney Island Fireworks scarf from   urlLink   Stitch 'N Bitch    &nbsp;  this weekend.&nbsp; Yea.&nbsp;&nbsp; I took pictures of it, but I didn't have the chance to get the pics on the blog yet.&nbsp; Actually, I just saw this morning that   urlLink  Google acquired Picasa   , so I suspect posting pics to my blog will be much easier from now on, once I download the now free Picasa.&nbsp; Previously, I was using   urlLink  Hello Bloggerbot   , which was fine, except I could only post pics as single posts (at least that's all I knew how to do), then I had to go back and edit the picture posts into&nbsp;one big flow-y post.&nbsp; It took a bit of time.&nbsp; If posting pictures is going to be easy now, then I guess I'll have to get more knitting done to post pictures of.&nbsp; How about that.&nbsp;     Update: Kind of misunderstood the whole Picasa thing.&nbsp; Learned how to add multiple pics and do easy editing with Hello, so perhaps future posts w/pics won't be such an ordeal for me. -L, 7/20.   &nbsp;  Back to the knitting... Um... Oh, so Coney is done, pics coming soon.&nbsp; I worked on the   urlLink  kitty hat   &nbsp;last night and did an ear.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I did not like the placement of the ear and wound up ripping it back out.&nbsp; The ear seemed to be a little too 'on top of my head,'&nbsp; and I just didn't like it.&nbsp; I'll try again tonight.  &nbsp;  For today at lunch, I brought the Fun Fur and Wool-Ease to swatch my next project, the Snowball Cat Bed, also&nbsp;from  Stitch 'N Bitch .&nbsp; I was thinking of making this a Christmas present for my cats, but I might get too excited and have to give it to them sooner.&nbsp; Finnegan really seems to enjoy eyelash yarn (and really, who doesn't?), so I might&nbsp;have to&nbsp;let them have it as soon as it's done, if he says so.&nbsp; Considering it's not even swatched yet, I'd say we have some time&nbsp;before I&nbsp;have to worry about that.  &nbsp;  Now, lest you think I only do projects from  Stitch 'N Bitch , I have been planning to make dishcloths as a Christmas&nbsp;gift for my mom.&nbsp; A woman at work gave me a knitted dishcloth pattern book some time last year when I was just starting to knit (immediately before I gave up), and I'm looking for that.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I know where it  used  to be -- on the bookshelf&nbsp;at home&nbsp;-- but I have not been able to find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We just redid the office a few months ago, and bought new bookshelves.&nbsp; I don't  think  I would have gotten rid of it, so I believe it should be there, but I must have looked through those books at least 5 times this weekend.&nbsp; I looked all over!&nbsp; There's not many places it could be.&nbsp; No sign of it yet.&nbsp; I think it was a thin, paperback, magazine-sized book, so maybe it slid between the pages of some other book at some point.&nbsp; Will continue the search.  &nbsp;  In other news, we hung two of four new interior doors this weekend.&nbsp; Hooray for home improvements.&nbsp; Not so much fun to do, but fun once they're done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have newly painted trim and new doors to match, I think we need to paint the hallway.&nbsp; I have also decided I'd like to get rid of the guest room which is only used about 2 or 3 times a year, and turn it into a craft room.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;a nearly new queen size bed in there, though, and we just have to figure out how to get rid of it.&nbsp; Not sure if it's legal to sell, so maybe we could donate?&nbsp; Or maybe we just have to throw it out.&nbsp; Also, with two cats, even if we could technically sell it,&nbsp;I don't know how many people would want to buy it.&nbsp; There's really no urgency for this project, but it's something to put on the list.

       Yay, home!&nbsp; I went almost four whole days without my knitting.&nbsp; Can you imagine?&nbsp; It was terrible.&nbsp; I'm probably exaggerating, though, considering I didn't have much free time... but still.&nbsp; So yesterday when I got home, I wasted no time getting back to the Coney scarf before I fell asleep from travel exhaustion.     &nbsp;   While in Bloomington, IN, I did visit the yarn store there, which was big, though mostly spinning machines(?) more than a large yarn supply, from what I could see.&nbsp; I didn't wind up buying anything because I would have had to buy needles and patterns and yarn, etc, etc.&nbsp; So I moseyed over to Howard's Bookstore across the way,&nbsp;and that&nbsp;was a delight.&nbsp; I saw two resident cats in the store; one looked just like my Finnegan, but he had green eyes.&nbsp; That made me miss my kitties, but it was fun to see cats in the store.&nbsp; There, I bought   urlLink   Knit: A Personal Handbook    , which I've been wanting for a while, and the next day I went back and bought   urlLink   The Little Box of Scarves    .&nbsp; Unfortunately, sans needles and yarn, there wasn't much I could do with these books/patterns.&nbsp; I really like the  Knit  journal, and I plan to use it as sort of a scrapbook for my projects with info and pictures of the finished goods.&nbsp;  The Little Box of Scarves  has a lot of neat patterns that are inspiring and versatile.     &nbsp;   That's about all the knitting news for me today.&nbsp; I hope to put the ears on my kitty hat this weekend, and maybe even finish the Coney scarf.

      I may very well go through knit-withdrawal by the time this week is up.  I'm leaving for a business trip to Indiana today.  What was supposed to be a two-day trip has just turned into a three day trip.  I didn't bring my knitting b/c I'm not checking a bag and didn't feel like dealing with security to try to knit on a one hour flight.  I thought maybe I'd find a yarn store in the area in case I had some free time, but I looked this morning and, alas, there are no yarn stores in the city I'll be visiting.  What kind of city is this, I wonder.  I'll look again when I get there.  Oh well, at least I packed lots of books and magazines.   Update: Thank you  urlLink Lynn  for sending me the yarn store  urlLink link  -- there is one where I'm going!

      I've been waiting for Lion Brand Fun Fur to go on sale, and yesterday, it did.  As soon as I saw the Michael's ad, I ran over to stock up for my next project: the Snowball Cat Bed from  SNB .  It's going to be Citrus, a blue and green mix, on the bottom and Indigo on the sides.  The pictures don't show it, but they actually do match very well.     .

      I had a wonderfully relaxing, yet productive weekend.  Saturday morning, Ben and I went to breakfast at a P&G Diner in Millvale, home of the best pancakes ever made.  They're crepe-thin, and oh-so-greasy.  It's a great little diner, complete with attached pharmacy.  We drove down early to make sure we'd get a seat, only to find that the diner didn't open until 8 am!  We were shocked.  Fortunately, we had the newspaper and I had my knitting, so we sat on a park bench outside the diner, Ben reading the paper and I working on my Coney scarf.  I felt like an old married couple, passing the time on the local town bench.  It was the best wait I've ever had.  :)  Today, I worked on my first scarf (ever), which is a gift for Ben.  It's been done for a while, but I had yet to block it.  A woman at my Stitch 'n Bitch told me that conditioner (as in, for hair) will soften itchy wool, so I tried that today, as it is Super Itchy (I used Reynolds Lopi, 100% virgin wool).  If that doesn't work, I'll sew a fleece panel in around the neck area.  I have a store-bought scarf of my own that employs this technique, and it does the job very well.  The scarf, being conditioned  urlLink     This job, of course, was being supervised by Finnegan...  urlLink     ...my adorable little helper  urlLink     Onto the blocking, where Finnegan continued his duties as overseer  urlLink     After laying the scarf out, I went to work on my kitty hat, where Isabelle made a comfy nest on my lap  urlLink     Meanwhile, Finnegan took a well-deserved nap after a long day's work  urlLink     Ta-da!!!  The hat is nearly complete.  Today I did the earflaps and I-cord.  All I have left is the kitty ears and pom-poms.  urlLink      urlLink     After all that I-cord, I could barely move my left hand, it was so cramped!  That was my first time doing I-cord, and I'm still undecided whether I like doing it or not.  I liked learning something new, but then it  was  rough on the hands and wrist after a while.  Later: Finnegan, still napping  urlLink

      I went to my first stitch & bitch last night.  Yay!  It was a good time, and the 3 hours I was there went by incredibly fast.  Plus, I got a lot of knitting done on my Coney Island scarf and Kitty hat (pics coming soon), and I even learned a lot of things.  All in all, a very productive and worthwhile evening was had by me.  And yeah, there was some bitching, too. :)

      Yes, another quiz today.  It's  sort of  knitting related, at least.  I don't know how true it is, but I like the part about looking delicate but being tough as nails.  That reminds me... a friend of mine in high school once told me that I seemed really sweet and innocent when she first met me, then when she got to know me, she realized that I was actually a bitch.  She said it in a complimentary sort of way, though.  (What does this have to do with the quiz? I don't know, I guess it goes back to that "delicate" thing.)     You are Shetland Wool. You are a traditional sort who can sometimes be a little on the harsh side. Though you look delicate you are tough as nails and prone to intricacies. Despite your acerbic ways you are widely respected and even revered.     urlLink   What kind of yarn are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      We lost a phase of power at work today, around 3:00.  Once upon a time, I may have been able to explain what that means, considering I  did  take a course in power systems while working toward my  electrical engineering  degree, but alas, I'm pretty sure I only passed that one because we had "homework partners" and I got lucky enough to pair up with a very intelligent young man named Mitch.  So, wherever you are, thanks, Mitch.    Anyway, during said power outage, I felt the need to sit by my stuff in case there was a fire, so that I could quickly grab it on the way out.  Once it was evident that there was not going to be a fire (I have an imagination, what can I say?), I decided to sit in someone else's sunlit office and listen to people bs while knitting my hat.  Knitting at work! Legally!  Also in this time, I swatched a bit of this green Can Can yarn I bought on clearance at a LYS.  Not sure what I want to do with it, but I thought if I made a swatch, I might get some inspiration.  You can see this yarn at the front of my so-called  urlLink stash  in one of the previous posts.  It's swirly.  Green's not really my color, but it's much prettier once it's knitted.  Here's the kitty hat... so far.  I'm getting nervous because it looks small, but I did check my gauge, I promise!  urlLink

      On my Christmas gift list is the Coney Island Fireworks scarf from SNB for my sister-in-law.  I actually found the recommended yarn at my LYS, and thought the Shadow was really cool.

      First, a knitting update:  I cast on for the second rectangle of my poncho last night.  I lost interest for a while there, and couldn't bring myself to try to cast on 75 stitches at work because I knew I'd really flub it up.  Had to have time.  Also did 40 minutes worth of garter stitch on the Never Ending Cat Bed Side on the way home from work.  I might be  almost  halfway done with it.  Now, a story: A little background... My husband is absolutely the sweetest guy ever, and would never say "no" to me buying anything, especially because while I like to shop, I don't actually buy to debt.  But, since we share our money, I like to keep him informed about my more, shall we say, frivolous purchases.  It's blasphemous to call yarn frivolous, I know, but I mean stuff that doesn't include food and face wash, and more yarn, when you just spent $100+ on yarn the week before.  You know.  Anyway, he does like to give me a mock hard time about stuff like this, so it's a fun little game we play.  The other day, I bought some more R2 Paper online because I'm just loving all the R2 tanks that  urlLink people  are  urlLink knitting .  I bought the mint and the blue to keep my pinkish company.  No biggie.  But I kept forgetting to mention it to Ben, and I didn't want the package to just  appear , since I have this thing about telling him stuff (see directly above). So....  I went for the Tell-Something-Worse-First approach.  The conversation went something like this:   Me:  So I'm thinking about buying a pair of shoes.  Ben:   Another  pair?  What kind of shoes?  Me:  They're black ballet flats.  Ben:  Aren't  those  black ballet flats? (pointing to the shoes on my feet)  Me:  Well, yeah, but these are different.  [I have  urlLink these  (in black) but think I want  urlLink these  now.    The difference is pretty obvious.  Hellooo, one has a bow and the other has a flower.  Sheesh.]   Ben:  Hm. Okay.  As long as you get rid of a pair of shoes. (He has this unusual philosophy where if you buy clothes, you should get rid of some old ones.  I don't fully grasp the concept, but it actually does help keep the storage needs down.)  Me:  Right.  Oh, and there's something else.  Ben:  Oh no, what did you buy? (He knows me so well.)  Me:  Um, yarn?  Ben:  More yarn?  What kind of yarn? (I went on to describe the yarn I bought and its purpose.)  Ben:  How much did it cost?  Me:  I bought two skeins at $8 each and there was $4 shipping. (I feel it's always best to itemize the cost so that he has to take time to do the math.  Even though $20 is a rather paltry sum, it's just a good habit.)  Ben:  Hm. Okay.  Anything else?  Me:  No, that's it.  I love you, Sweetie. :)  Ben:  I love you too, Sweetie.  He's so cute.  I really am lucky. &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;

      Okay, note on the last post.  I have an imagination, and I like to imagine unusual scenarios, like being allergic to knitting needles.  Just a note.  So, enough nonsense... I'm finally going to knit something non-scarf, non-hat, non-cat.  It's a sleeveless roll-neck sweater, knit in the round, the pattern for which is in the back of   urlLink Zen and the Art of Knitting  .  There's no picture, and I wouldn't normally knit something that I didn't have a picture of, but I can pretty much imagine what it's going to look like.    I thought I was going to knit this with two skeins of  urlLink Homespun in Edwardian  that I have and don't know what else to do with, but...  1)I'd probably never pick this color for a top, even though it is charcoal-colored, which I normally like.  I don't know why; it might have something to do with the speckles.   2)I don't consider myself to be a yarn snob, because I like to think that virtually any yarn can be put to good use, but, I was looking at Homespun yesterday at Jo-Ann because it was on sale, and because I had decided that even though I already had two skeins of Homespun at home, I'd rather knit in color this time, but I couldn't bring myself to buy any for this top.  It just seemed too...  shiny .  I couldn't picture myself buying something made of this off the rack at a store, based on the look of the skeins.   (Side note: the first scarf I ever made (crochet) was for Ben in this color, with this yarn, and it turned out okay. It was very soft, but got kind of furry when he wore it and hadn't shaved.  So I do know that the yarn isn't that bad.)   So, I went back and forth on this one (even while writing this post), thinking I'd just do it in Edwardian, since I had it, then thinking I wouldn't do it in Edwardian because of the two notes above, and that really wouldn't make sense... and I think I've decided to do the top in some other yarn that I don't have.  But THEN, if I have to buy yarn, why not buy it for a pattern I  really  like?  So I might as well just do the top in Edwardian, just to knit a top and use up some yarn.   Such is my life: ruled by indecision and over-analyzation of virtually everything.

      Absolutely no knitting progress to report this morning.  None. Oh, okay, I did a few more rows on the Never Ending Cat Bed Side.  Think of it as knitting a really wide, 50" long scarf.  Never. Ending.  In place of actual knitting news, I shall present a thought on knitting which might affect only about 6%(15%?) of the population, if that 6%(15%?) were knitters.  It appears that I have recently developed an allergy to nickel.  My wedding and engagement ring settings are made of white gold, which, in the US, contains nickel.  The allergy can start when the rhodium plating wears off and the nickel starts leeching out.  (Mind you, in the UK and EU, they do not allow nickel in jewelry because of such allergies; they use palladium in white gold instead of nickel.)    For the past few weeks, my skin has been getting increasingly irritated under my rings, and taking them off more did not help.  I did a search for 'white gold allergy' and found information about nickel allergies.  So, I'm quite certain that this is what happened, though I haven't been to a dermatologist about it.  Oh, and once it starts, it's here to stay.  So now I might be allergic to other things, like earrings, zippers and who-knows-what-else.  I guess I'll just have to wait and see, or see a doctor to check (though what I've read indicates that the tests can be inconclusive).   So, what does this have to do with knitting and why is it on my knitting blog? Be-caauuuse, I was thinking about Addi Turbos, looked them up, and guess what they are...  urlLink nickel-plated brass .  This probably wouldn't even be a problem, because really, I'd probably be in contact with the knitting more than the needles if I were using them (as in, it's not exactly "prolonged contact with skin"), but is it worth the risk?  So, no more visions of swift knitting with Addi Turbos for me, even though I couldn't find any references to people having reactions to these needles.  References  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here , and if you do a Google or Yahoo search on   urlLink nickel allergy jewelry   (brings up graphic results on Google. Ick.), or   urlLink white gold nickel allergy  , lots and lots of articles come up... you get the idea.    Really, it's not a big deal, and I'm not worried about it.  At worst, I'll have to get a platinum ring setting.

      From Merriam-Webster's online  urlLink dictionary :  Main Entry:  urlLink Eros   Pronunciation: 'er-"äs, 'ir- Function: noun Etymology: Greek  ErOs , from  erOs  sexual love; akin to Greek  erasthai  to love, desire 1 : the Greek god of erotic love -- compare  urlLink CUPID  2 : the sum of life-preserving instincts that are manifested as impulses to gratify basic needs, as sublimated impulses, and as impulses to protect and preserve the body and mind -- compare  urlLink DEATH INSTINCT  3 a : love conceived in the philosophy of Plato as a fundamental creative impulse having a sensual element b  often not capitalized  : erotic love or desire   So, the Eros scarf is finished, and I like it, and it is Good.  Aside from its reaction to dropped stitches, I think the worst part of working with it was the way it constantly got snagged on my nails and fingertips.  Fortunately, it's summer and my hands aren't dry, but if they were, that would have been a huge problem.  Near the end, for some reason, minute cuts would appear in my nails and snag the ladder "steps" with every stitch, much like pantyhose.  It was annoying.  Now I'm a little leery about wearing it, but heck, I didn't spend several hours of my life knitting the scarf so that it can sit in a drawer.  I want to put up a  urlLink cute hook  I have to hang things like this, so that I can appreciate them even when they're not in use, but I'll have to plan the location of the hook carefully so as not to attract certain feline members of my family.  Having recently finished   urlLink Zen and the Art of Knitting  , I read the definition of eros (above) and think that definition #2 applies to this scarf.  I like to think of the scarf as protecting and preserving the body (even if this one is more for decoration than warmth), and the knitting of the scarf as protecting and preserving the mind.  It seems the purpose of  Zen  was to prove that knitting is a form of meditation.  The author interviewed a number of knitters to get their views on the matter, but in the end, I don't think she actually proved her theory because most of the women she interviewed did not feel that knitting was actual meditation.  Regardless, she did make a lot of relevant statements about the relaxing and stress-reducing aspect of the process of knitting.  Hence, preservation of the mind.

      I had plans to finish my Eros scarf yesterday at lunch, so that I could get started on the second piece of my poncho immediately afterward.  Little did I know that a little guy by the name of Dropped Stitch would come along and ruin not only my plans, but also dash all of the excitement I once had surrounding this scarf.    There is something about knitting at work that breaks my concentration.  9 times out of 10, if I start a row badly, it's when I'm starting off at work.  I start my knits with the yarn held forward for that extra stitch, or something.  9 times out of 10.  So, yesterday, when I arrived at the end of my row, I counted my stitches.  21.  I only cast on 20, so 21 is a dirty number.  I unknitted to the beginning.  To the inevitable beginning. Or end, if you prefer.  When I found myself at the last one/two stitches, I unknitted, only to find a bigger mess than a simple extra loop on the needle.  Not only do I have a problem with starting up knitting at work, I also have a problem with unknitting the stitch at the beginning of a row.  I do not know what my problem is.  I just don't pick up the right piece of stitch or something.  I have yet to figure this out.  So, Mr. Extra Stitch morphed into Mr. Dropped Stitch, which, if you know Eros, is a Very Bad Thing.  Eros is soooo mistake-unfriendly. So unfriendly.  I cannot begin to express the level of frustration I felt as I ripped back 10 rows rather than try to pick up the stupid dropped stitch, which of course, was on the edge of my work -- bad enough on its own, now add the edge into the equation.  When I had ripped down to the row holder that I'd spent minutes getting into place, I found that I'd put the stitches on the holder incorrectly, hence, more droopy, droppy stitches.  Another 10 rows lost.  Approximately.  At this point, my lunch time was well over and I had to put this away before my manager came over (because he has this uncanny ability to appear at my desk whenever I'm doing something knitting related rather than work related).  Frustrated, I threw the now annoying scarf into its bag and proceeded to be consumed by the thought of it for the rest of the afternoon.    Last night, I managed to knit back to the point where I had been before lunch, adding a few more rows.  I'm almost done, and really and truly do intend on finishing this scarf at lunchtime today.  But carefully.  Very carefully.  ***  I've been knitting for two months now, and I think the hardest thing to learn so far has been the ability to accept frogging as a valid part of the knitting process.  I know that everyone has to do it, and on much larger and more complicated pieces, so I realize that frogging twenty rows of skinny garter stitch is relatively negligible in comparison.  Still, it is a little frustrating.  But I'm learning.

      I saw  urlLink this sweater  in the Anthropologie catalog this morning, and thought it was so cool.  It is so interesting, and it appears to be made of really simple stitches.  Definitely one to keep in mind.

      Ah, home.  There is nothing like being home, and being in the company of cats. :)    The cats were more than happy to see us return (though their "grandparents" had been watching over them while we were away), and I believe Finnegan must weigh at least 15 pounds now due to the erratic performance of his overpriced  urlLink auto-feeder .  Our trip to Georgia was very nice.  We did lots of stuff -- rented a pontoon, I swam in a river for the first time ever, we visited the incredible  urlLink Callaway Gardens , and ate lots of vacation food.  The weather was really nice, and all-in-all, it was a good little getaway.  I had no trouble getting my bamboo knitting needles with Eros scarf on the plane either way, so that was a definite plus.  I spent a few hours here and there knitting that scarf throughout the weekend, and it's almost done.  Yay. :)  Also of note, in a rare moment of unabashed honesty, as we were driving from the airport to Ft. Benning at some ungodly hour Thursday night, my husband (obviously in a state of fatigued delirium) informed me that my singing of lite rock favorites was actually quite terrible.  That was the thanks I got for trying to keep him awake.  Hrmph .  This morning, on the way into work, I serenaded him to Elton John's Tiny Dancer and he actually used the word "abuse."  Again,  hrmph .  Oh, and I got to feed real, live turtles at Callaway Gardens, and they were so cute! (...in the "wild" anyway;  not sure if I'd want one at home.)  Finnegan is  definitely  going to be a turtle this Halloween.  So, knitting-wise, the affordably luxurious Eros scarf is almost complete. This week, in addition to finishing it, I'm planning on doing the second panel of my poncho, and working on the cat bed some more.  Finally, R2's paper yarn color  urlLink pinkish  is my new favorite color, hence the new background color.  I had set that Friday, but didn't republish the blog, so I guess it showed up with  urlLink Michelle's   urlLink comment  from the other day.   urlLink Nora  is making a tank with the R2, which I had the opportunity to see last week (it's gorgeous).  I had just bought some the previous Saturday for a  urlLink Polly -type  urlLink scarf  (which I now think I will combine with  urlLink green and/or blue ), so I'm excited about that. :)  That's all for now...

      As I mentioned in my last post, Ben and I will be leaving tonight for the weekend to visit my brother-in-law in Fort Benning, GA.  Yeah, it just isn't hot enough for us here in Western PA.  I planned ahead though, and started my dressy Eros scarf (for me, me, me) last night on seemingly harmless bamboo circulars so that I can a) take it on the plane and b) knit without a furry blanket on my lap.    I find that if I knit loosely enough, the yarn isn't giving me too much trouble, plus, the yarn is a mix of white, tan and gold, so it's been easy enough to identify the individual stitches.  I must thank both  urlLink Ellen  and  urlLink Nora , the Eros veterans, for the advice they have given me. :) Oh, and I'm using  urlLink Nora's scarf pattern , but on size 13's and with 20 sts cast on.  Ms. Poncho needs some blocking. I'm getting tons of good advice about the edging, so once I get the back piece done, I'll have lots of options.  I agree with  urlLink Wendy's post today , where she said that black doesn't make for blog-friendly pics.  But, I still want to post about it, even though it doesn't look like much right now. So, there it is.  I'll be away until Monday, not blogging, but still knitting (as long as the airport security people are good to me). Until then,  urlLink Feed the Cats .  :)

      Thought I'd share some progress pics...  The beginning of the side of the cat bed   urlLink     The beginning of my Eros scarf (started tonight)  urlLink     The first half of my poncho, or  Poncho, Part A (it's currently roly-poly).  My husband lovingly refers to this picture as "The Thing." (I admit, an extra 30 seconds of effort could have brought a picture of me with said poncho piece draped over my shoulder, but then it wouldn't look like a rectangle, now, would it?)  urlLink     We're going on a trip to Georgia this weekend to visit my brother-in-law, and after Ben dropped me off at Stitch & Bitch tonight, he went to Michael's and picked us up Hello Kitty and SpongeBob Activity Travelers.  With these, we are sure to be the envy of everyone on the plane, especially the 3 and up crowd. :)    urlLink     Oh, and did I mention my new pet turtle?  urlLink

      (General Life Observation) Let them get in front of you in line.  100% Guaranteed to make someone's day.   I had to run to Target last night (which used to be my favorite thing in the world, before I started knitting), where I was bewitched by a cute pale blue flower & ribbon choker on clearance. I picked it up.  I walked a few steps.  I turned and put it back.  Went about my business.  Later, in line, I started thinking of the things I could wear the choker with and decided that I had to buy it.  I like chokers, even though I haven't worn one in years. But I like them, darn it, and I'm old enough to wear what I want.  The man behind me had one item.  I told him to go ahead, that I had to run back and get something.  He was taken aback.   I was letting him get in front of me?  Letting him go first?  Late on a Tuesday night, when I wanted to get home just as much as he did?   He thanked me profusely.  When I got back to the register, he was just finishing paying, and he thanked me again. If that wasn't making someone's day, then I don't know what is.  It's happened to me before, so I know from experience that it is a Good Thing.

      In my last post's comments,  urlLink Ellen  asked what pattern I am using for my poncho. Right now, it's loosely based on the  urlLink Choo-Choo Knit Poncho  ("Choo-Choo" seems likes such a funny name), only without the ribbing, and on size 17 circular needles. I wanted it to be kind of open/airy, so I'm doing it in stockinette (started in garter but it was too stretchy and not open enough). My swatch gauge was 10 sts and 11 rows per 4 inches. Based on estimated measurements from one I saw at Marshall's that I liked, I want to make my rectangles 15" by 30".  Naturally, it would be wonderful if I had a lot of different stitch patterns in my repertoire to do something a little more fancy on my own, but I think I'll be happy with the stockinette. If not, I'll try again. But maybe with different yarn (as in, not the reused, failed-poncho yarn). I'm using Plymouth Encore, which is 75% acrylic 25% wool, and it seems that repeated rippings-out are making it funny (though it could be my imagination), so if I'm going to do another one, I think I'll just do something different entirely. Maybe in  c  o  l  o  r . Wooo...  Finally, I want to add something to it at the end. I'm considering ivory or pink Fun Fur, or just a single crochet border around the edge, or possibly fringe. Maybe a crocheted flower...  Yesterday, I made a little picture.  I've named her Ms. Poncho.

      The home computer is up and running. As of last weekend. Frustratingly, it was not a problem with the firewall or the virus scanning software.  Instead, it was a problem with the DSL people.  The same DSL people who swore up and down it was not a problem on their end.  The same DSL people who suggested I uninstall my firewall and virus scanning software. The same DSL people who told me to leave my computer on, on Friday, while they checked things out some more.  Hence, I arrived home on Friday evening to find my computer, connected to the internet, without firewall or virus scanning software, and no less than 14 viruses and web bugs and God-Only-Knows-What infecting over 50 of my files.  What a pain in the ass. Now I have things to worry about like why Internet Explorer opens some stupid search page every time I type an address in (we've recently switched to  urlLink Avant Browser , but this still bothers me), and whether or not some evil hacker stole our 2003 tax return information.  That's probably the only thing that was of importance on the machine that someone might use for nefarious purposes, but it's enough to worry about.   [Update: Realized that Avant is just an upgrade to IE. Duh.  Switched to a completely different browser. -L]   So, between fussing with the computer and restarting it a zillion times, reinstalling the camera software, etc, etc, etc, I have been doing little knitting.  I say little, but really I always do "little" because of all the other things I like to do in addition to knitting.  It makes for slow progress.  No big whoop; it'll all get done.  I'm making poncho progress, and I worked on it last night while watching  urlLink For a Few Dollars More , just for additional inspiration.  I don't have any pics to post yet just because there's really nothing to see.  Just a few rows of black stitches.  It would be nice if I could finish the first piece this week, though...  Other than that, I'm still working on the sides for the cat bed.  I left the round bottom part out for the kitties to enjoy, and Finnegan likes to lounge on it.  I probably should have made the larger size, but I think he'll fit anyway.  I was playing with him last night and put the mat on his back, and he looked just like a turtle! (Okay, just like a cat in a turtle Halloween costume.) I took pictures. I think if I had made it smaller, it would have been a good turtle shell.

      Yay.  I feel so boring, because it's going to be black.  But I wear a lot of black and I don't wear a lot of colors, so it'll fit with my wardrobe, which is what I wanted. Someday, perhaps I'll develop a sense of adventure. Perhaps. I'm just glad it's started. (Sorry for the lack of enthusiasm, but I'm not really awake yet.)

      Let me just say that my mind goes completely blank when I walk into a yarn store.  I was thinking off all the yarn I wanted all week long, then when I got to the store... no clue what I was doing there.  Totally overwhelming.  After about an hour, I wound up with all this and some needles. I'm really liking the wormy-blue stuff in the lower right. :)  urlLink
