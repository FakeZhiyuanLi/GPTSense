      Hello...good morning, noon, night, afternight, evening, or whatever. I have my banner ready to give to Mall Monkeys, I just need to wait for my Norlarco funds to transfer into my PayPal. Then I'll go buy ad space on MM and buy Christmas gifts. Anyway! Jacque dearest is still banned from the computer because of grades, and until she is re-allowed on she won't be able to post. I invited her.  Onto teh good stuff!  Seinfeld. Do you watch it? I do. Kramer ROCKS!  Also: Whaddya think of Put Title HERE? Email me at:  urlLink Mail me. Be honest. And I swear, if you sign me up for crazy mailing lists I'll have Tux, the Linux Penguin ban your IP to hell! TO HELL WITH YOUR IP! Thanks. Really, I just wanna know what you think of my blog. Criticize me. Don't flame me though. FKM'rs SUCK.

      KILL AOL. Honestly, here it is, 12:11 at morning, and AIM has to have their STUPID little talking ads that come up and shit out your audio until you stop it. And when you DO stop it, it loads a REALLY SLOW popup ad! DIE, AOL, DIE!

      Well, It's THAT time of year again. Love, gifts, family, sex, beer...uh...I mean...love, gifts, family...help me out here...  SPEAKING of helping out, I've decided to advertise on MallMonkeys. You should, too. It's REALLY cheap and Drobile will really appreciate you. He rocks. He rocks Jacque's socks. By the way, don't forget to read my VERY first post. Do it. Missy said to.

      ‘Lo all. Ben, my life, my love, my sex pickle, you were correct in your second assumption, way back when. *Points to the bottom* I am sneaking on my computer, because I love you, and I didn’t even need to  sexually  coerce you into giving me the password! Hurrah! Anywhore, I have little to write about, but I figured I’d write anyway, just to show Ben that I care. Eric Drobile  makes me orgasm  rocks my socks, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. In other news, life sucks a dirty, dirty pickle. Alaska is in seven days, and I haven’t a clue as to what’s coming. GO ME! Right…um…nobody cares about what I have to say, so howzabout I give you a nifty little plug for everything that means something to me, eh? Okay, I see the way you’re gaping at me in horror, so I’ll refrain. Perhaps next time, okie? Okie. In closing, I love Ben. He is my sexy über-leet hacker sex pickle…thing. Oh baby? Oh baby. *Grin* Goodbye, nonexistent audience. Adieu and…er...yes.

      Hello my lovely string cheese heads. Yes I did just call you a string cheese head.  *glares around suspiciously*  First off, dearest beej, that commenter must have been you or a real person because (1) typing like that would make Teh JaQ faint into a convulsing horrid mass. And (2) I do not talk like that...and Teh JaQ can vouch. Mwah.   Second off, JaQ!!! You kicked ash in math today, haha you were all over that book like...syrup...on...Landon? or pancakes.  Yes, pancakes should do. *evil grin*  Third off, BEN!!!! Oh my FREAKING god...you and your tang bottle are kinda scary.   For our only reader, Krystyna, he had a Tang pack and ... was playing...with the straw...and *censored*-ing JaQ with it.   Double ew.   Any ways skank.  Eh. That was it.  Sally: Kiyoshi! What happened? Kiyoshi: It's nothing really... Sally: YOU HAD BETTER TELL ME RIGHT NOW UNLESS YOU WANT THE [poop] KICKED OUT OF YOU TWICE IN ONE DAY!!!  Hahah laters! ~Kariney~

      Have you ever stepped back, paused to reflect on your life, and really  didn't  like what you saw? Yeah, me neither. :DD Well, okay, that's a lie. I do that all the time, but this isn't about me, it's about you, right? Right? Yeah, thought so.  I think I'm supposed to be writing about my day, but my day sucked a pickle, so that seems no fun! I've already told you my moving traumas, and I have  no  intention of telling anyone about my  sex  love life....in all of its infititesimal (only spelled right) entirety. I cant tell you about my birthday (ten days! Woot!) So, I suppose I may vent my frustrations on you in another way. If you'll grant me permission, I'd like to step out of this little JaQ bubble that I live in and be a bratty, whiny, shallow teenage girl, okie? Okie.   Damn it, damn it, damn it!! There were fifty people there, and I was not in the continental United States! Rosalie was there! 'Tato Legs was there! Infuego was there! Kevin was there! Ashton was there! Let me restate this one last time... EVERYONE WAS THERE, BUT ME!  *Remembers to breathe* I hate the world for making me miss it, but that's really all right. I'm over it. Yes. Yes I am.   There. I feel better now. Thanks for listening. Now that I've completely run out of things to say, I really ought to be going. Goodnight, pip pip and German sex to each and every one of you. Have a nice evening. Ta. Stop staring at me.   ...Dirty stalker...*Glares*

      Hello my dearest friends, family, and Ben. I agree completely with Beej's last post. Comment, you fools! The button is there for a reason! But, alas, if I were to have a post as short as this, then it would be a true first. I think I've finally come to accept my place as the one who talks too much. Wow, now I almost wish I had something to say. I have a problem...an indecision if you will. South Carolina is calling my name, and it's only a matter of time before I'm asked to pack up my things (which, ironically enough, I just finished unpacking last night)  I'm not even entirely sure I've told Ben yet, nor have I told many people at all, excluding Sara/Cera, Rosalie and a few others. But, do I really  want  to leave? That, my friends, is another question entirely...one which I'm not sure I know the answer to. Along with that, what if it's just another scare like last time? This time last year I was tearing my hair out wondering whether or not I'd be moving to  North  Carolina. But, then again, David and Mom weren't engaged, he didn't have a job oppurtunity waiting for him that can be taken as early as two weeks, and every other little factor that has served to contribute to this awkwardly silent massteria raging inside of my mildly insane little head. Oh well, I suppose the best I can do right now is go on like I always do, making it from day to day without exploding. That  is  the best I can do, right?

      *Is not dancing for joy*  *...Really*  I HAVE RETURNED!!!!! I am in the continental United States!! And, what's more, I have stories to tell! Cate, my Alaskan hump crumpet, and I went to see Peter Pan 's nipple , and not Seneca. No. That would be wrong, but anywhore, there was this boy there named Alex, (Methinks he may have been a mite prepubescent, but we don't have to talk about that...yet.) At the very end of the movie, he turned around, and we got to have an interesting conversation. Whee!   Alex Boy:  Hi, what're your guys' names?  Cate:  Hi, this is Fred  JaQ:  And this is Ralph.  Alex Boy:  Really....what grade are you guys in?  JaQ:  Second  Alex Boy:  Umm...cool.  JaQ:  Yeah...I'm a foreign exchange student  Alex Boy  Cool! From where.  JaQ:  ....Canada.  Cate:  *Laughs hysterically*  Alex Boy  *Gets up to leave* Call me!  JaQ:  Will do! Cate, what do you suppose is the number for the circus?  Cate:  *Laughs some more*  Exuent All   So yes, that was the highlight of my trip, that  nipple  conversation. That and, I got to redo my bedroom. It's green now. Hurrah! Also, I got to go to Cate's house. Sara and Becca were there, and we talked about lesbians somehow or another...and...something else that I can't honestly say I remember. Hmm...lessee...I feel as though I owe all of you a long post, but I really don't have much else to say, other than that *Inserts verbal plug*  Odd One Out 's next chapter is about eight pages long now, Katiefic is as good as dead, and I just killed Jessica. *Is stupid* Go me. Oh, I also have a bitchload of catching up to do. Like Mallmonkeys and such, so alas, alas, I have to depart. Goodbye Ben, and the newly joined Rosalie. I  lust after  love you both. G'bye.

       WOOOOO!!!!!!!! 15 YEARS 15 YEAAARSSSS WEEEEEE!!!! *throws confetti t  everywhere* WOOOOO!!! TAKE THAT YOU CLEAN FREAKS!!!! *blows everyone's noise making horns making an obnoxious....* SQUAN-KEE!!!! SQUAN-KEE!!!! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!  I LOVE PARTYYYSSSS!!!!!  .... *cough* Writing.  Right.  Well, on the lower side of the bloggie excitement spectrum... We have a black belt promotion today. And that means that the Demo team or the "Fight" team will be performing. And that means that I will be performing. And normally this is not a problem. Except today, my entire body is sore for one reason or another, but mostly my back because Mr. Cristy-Cracker physically educated it on how to be dead for three days straight. (I'm going to continue as though you care, because it makes ME feel better. So bloooh on you.) And then I believe I pulled a leg muscle *dies* last night, along with burning the tops of my feet and both knees on the mats. After this demo, which is highly important BECAUSE it's a black belt promo...I will be resigning my highly coveted place as "Most Attendant Demo Member" for the easily acheived "I'm too flipping much in pain to come to Demo Tonight Member". And that's all I've got to say aboot that.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY JACQUEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *blows more horns* *throws more confetti t * *keels over from excitement*  ~Teh Karine~   Because every team needs a leader

         'Lo all. I apologize for the lack, relatively speaking of course, of posts as of late. As far as excuses go, I was torn between 'I have a lot on my plate lately,' and 'I don't have anything interesting to say.' But, in the end, I decided I'd go with 'We have no real audience, so I don't see the need to perform like a dancing monkey in tights every six hours.' Ahh, bitterness and sarcasm just sounds so much better when it comes from me!  Kidding. I'm not quite  that  bitter/cold/bitchy/whatever. Especially not today! Happy Birthday to me in.....10 hours and fourteen minutes. Not that I'm counting down or anything...  Anywho, this was mainly just a post to tell you that I'm not dead, yet at least, and that if any of you actually  DO  listen, then it'd be nice to hear from you every once in awhile. I know that beej's pressing and prodding gets old, but c'mon folks. All we want to know is whether or not we're wasting our time spouting witty anecdotes for the pleasure of complete strangers. I mean, when you think about it, we're only a step or two above  How to Become a Cam-Whore in Five Easy Steps!  because of the fact that we  do  put ourselves out there for you to judge and critique, to laugh and to cry with. The least you could do is tell us whether or not you're listening.  Wow, I feel better now, and inane babble seems to be rising to the surface. That's always fun!  I plan on writing and posting another chapter for  Odd One Out  tomorrow, despite the fact that most of my viewers, and a good chunk of my friends, have really stopped caring about the trials and tribulations of Andrea "Squeak" Dean. However, I know what I can do to reel then back in: promise them sex, (whether in person or in the story has yet to be decided.) lots and lots of sex. I've already have a friend ask me when I was going to "get to the good stuff," as she so succintly put it. Ah, it's so great to know that the fact that I can write about sex without even once using a profane reference to a mixer has earned me such a high place among my peers. Really...  Wow, this feels like a long post. Was this a long post? Eh, whatever. At least 'KrYsTyNa!!1' likes 'wat we hav 2 say!' OmG! sTfU!!1 *Twitch* Thanks for listening dear. I really hope that you like what is to come. Thanks all, and have a nice evening.   Every Pippin Needs a Merry...

      Yes, yes, LAN gamers! LAN2 HAS ARRIVED! Lan Party was a FLOP, except that Blake and Skadberg are now waived the 5.00 fee. I might be able to get Rennisance to sponsor LAN2, and I have plans for LAN3 to be a 2-day event! This time, (LAN2) will be hosted in the basement and the main floor. Pisses me off that I have to use my laptop's dock for 100 Megabit Ethernet, because I don't want to do it wireless. Oh, and we're getting a 5-port switch and from Steve, we get a 24-port managed hub and all the network cable we can eat! (Sort of.) Games this time around will be Half-Life, AoEII, BF: 1942, NFS, and Medal of Honor series. So, again, like with Lan Party,  urlLink E-Mail me! This includes Karine and JaQ if they want to come. They also get waived the fee for being PTH'ers. Oh, and if Krystynana even exists, you'd better fucking email me unless you want to get the shit kicked out of you twice in one day.

         A Series of Mildy Amusing Events        Oh look! It's a test to see how much HTML JaQ can cram into a single post! Wootage! For once, I have absolutely nothing profound to say. GO ME! Acutually this is just a random medley of funny things that have been said to me (Or I have said on a few occasions) and I just felt the need to share them with all of you.      Just a Bit of Background Information:   I was IMed by a Random!Stalker earlier this evening, telling me that she had read my story on Fanfiction.net, that beej happened to post in the...er...post below. Madness ensued...sort of.   funinthesunbabe8:  my name is Wendy  funinthesunbabe8:   Summers  funinthesunbabe8:   from Maine  xBobTCat:  Nice to meet you. I'm JaQ.  funinthesunbabe8:   i love french boys!  funinthesunbabe8:   im french myself.............just look at my armpits  xBobTCat:  I'm actually a girl. JaQ is just short for Jacque  Oh baby. Nothing like a little gender confusion to get a girl in touch with her feminine side. So later, after I told her about the conversation clip that I'll show you next, she told me that I watched too much porn. I was offended at first, but then I realized, oh crap...anyone but me would think that I  did  watch dirty movies. That worked wonders for my confidence. Moving on! Dani, one of my dearest friends, and I were talking, and yes, the Johnny we refer to IS Depp, but I don't want to explain myself more than I have to...  xBobTCat:   I SAW JOHNNY'S WANG TODAY!!!  xBobTCat:   (Sorta!)  xBobTCat:   (BUT STILL!)  xBobTCat:   LMAO!!!  sweetpea03182:  Explain!  sweetpea03182:  How did this...viewing...happen?? Rofl  xBobTCat:   I'll do you one better!  xBobTCat:  I'll show you! It's like a wang silhouette!   xBobTCat:   A....wangouette!  So yes, my dear viewer s,  I'm not a deep person at all. I am, in fact, very shallow, and very immature. But, on the plus side, I showed her the picture and she flipped out too. So long as I'm not alone, life is good. Finally, just a few clips I saw from the Lord of the Rings special on A&E (Again, I watched it with Danisorta.)   Interviewer Guy:  What has been your favorite part about working on this movie?  Dominic Monaghan:  Being surrounded by beautiful women and sleepin' on a pile'a cash.    Elijah Wood:  You know, in the sixties, it mirrored Vietnam, so the hippies really took it to heart.  Interviewer Guy:  Yes, we did.   Aaaaand, I'm spent. So, my friends, I hope you enjoyed the "medley" (heehee!) of things that make a whackjob smile. Have a nice evening.   And now back to your regularly scheduled programming...

        *Grins* Now that I have your attention...  I've committed a sin against my admin, and I deserve to be expelled. I have another journal. A live journal to be specific. I'd give you a direct link, but there is information in it that I'd prefer some people not see. I would have felt awful not telling you, especially Beej, because I was worried that he might be rather uptight/pissy/paranoid about something. Yes, love. I know that "we have PTH," and I couldn't be more sorryish even if I tried. So, in short, I love the world, and I also love you. Yes, even you. Forgive me for not rant/bitching about something, but I simply don't have the time. *Twisted Smile* I love playing games with Karine. She's just so much fun!

I know no HTML!!" Please, please,  please,  can we change it? Umkay? Umkay!  Right-o, next order of business. My diary was deleted last night. A year, 306 pages, 3445 notes, 159 entries, of my life was deleted by someone who couldn't punctuate a single sentence to save her life. I didn't do a thing but cry. Lord, how I cried. All last night, sporatic periods of today, and then when I went onto TOD today and realized that it really wasn't there. But then, I did the right thing for the first time in my life today. There were girls, girls that I actually think may have done it to me, that I cracked, destroyed, and nearly deleted sometime in November. So, I got into it today, and I remade it. I apologized to the people that, more likely than not, did this to me. I've never done what can be called "the right thing" before, but I feel really good about it.   I guess the only thing I really don't understand is that, if I was nice enough to do this, why is it that I was enough of a bitch to be called a communist, an internet whore, and then to be deleted? Who have I ever been that mean to? Ablah. Nu, I've started over, and so therefore I will not dwell on the past. *Nods* See? I'm like a walking, talking self-help tape! Whee!  I...have nothing more to say other than..."What? You want to buy ugly pants?" Have a nice evening, all. Please, drink plenty of coke and stay off the roads.

         If you'll pardon me, I'd really  really  like to be selfish for a moment or two. Yesterday was my birthday, as my two  lovely  companions have informed you, and I'd like to give you a brief rundown of what happened. Also, if you could, please tell me whether or not I'm just being selfish, because even saying this just feels wrong.  So, yesterday began with me being woken up and dragged to  Women Supporting Women , a church group that my mom started, so that I could babysit. The meeting started at nine AM, and that required me being up at eight. So, we get there, and,  Horror of all Horrors , no kids showed up. So, I sat, amusing myself with several assorted childrens books until about ten-thirty when we had to drive to Loveland to bowl. (Shut up, I never said that I had a life.)  So I went, bowled fairly well, and got good and embarrassed when Mum had my name flashed across all twenty-six screens and came down and gave me a rose and some balloons. Jack Oxten, the pervy jackass on the next lane politely, and very loudly, informed me that I'd reached the age of consent. Go me. Ew. Anywho re , we went to the mall afterward, visiting the huge Sidewalk Sale that was going on, and I bought  Dancing In My Nuddy Pants  and read it in a night. See? Told you I had no life. So, after wandering aimlessly for a few hours, we haded home, where I got to see the two birthday hacks from my chums, and a few, or a lot, hearty "HAPPY BIRTHDAYs!" That was nice. Pity that it only happens once a year.   So then, I went to babysit the brats at around six, thinking that it'd be an early night and I'd be home by nine. But alas,  non , I was stuck there until one in the morning. How long does it take to go to dinner? Ah well. So, I came home, drowsy as all hell, and went to bed. And...erm...huzzah. That was my birthday. No presents to speak of, minus a Plato's Closet giftcard and the knowledge that I  would've  gotten a cellphone, but mum's not sure whether or not we're moving, and there's some kind of penalty (penal. Heehee!) for breaking the first year's contract. *Le sigh* Oh well. I'm not complaining that there wasn't much, just that it's over, and I can't look forward to being treated like a princess until my sweet sixteen in 364 more days. Bah. Not crying about that. Not, not, not! It was a nice birthday. Really. I'm just a spoiled brat and wanted something special. It's more than other kids get, right?  Pardon me, I've just disgusted myself. I'm off to skulk somewhere and tell myself to get a grip, because this is the stupidest thing I've ever gotten down about. Ever. I love you all, and hope you have a fabulous January 18th.

        Striking is boring as hell, yo. Therefore, I post to say I return. Beej and I have worked out our conditions, and we hope to make PTH a real website eventually then, who knows? We might actually get real readers! Ones that don't like to insult our intelligence with poor linguistic skills or the inability to capitilize their letters...and Jenelle. (I apologize × 654945645145.4 if I spelled it wrong. I'm awful with names) Yes, bitches, this is as close to an angry rant as you'll probably ever get from me.   Who knows, maybe my heart's just not in it. After all, how can one write a rant of the angry persuasion if one has just ended the best day in the entire world?    Jim:  Ben, I think you're lacking a chromosome.  Ben:  What? I'm lactating? *Feels chest*  Rosalie, Jacque and Jim:  O.O!  God, how I love the world. I love my Beej and I love my Karine more than life itself. Thanks for the great day, lovelies.   "Because there are few things that could make me happier right now..."

      From our comment bag: "dude, you complain too much, bitch. i think you need to just shut up and write. you wanna go on strike? good. this thing's better without you."  Flaming teh JaQ is going too far. I log IP adresses, and should give you a quote of mine. "Do not meddle in the affairs of hackers." You have been warned.  Other then that, pea green stays for personal reasons.  Also, if you have a news viewer, PTH now has an XML feed, if you care. http://puttitlehere.blogspot.com/atom.xml   "Because FKM'rs can suck a dirty IPSec policy."

        Yeah, you read right. As of the moment this is posted, JaQ is on strike. Beej, I've tried to tell you this before, but the whole "I'm the admin., bow to me!" routine has  got  to stop. Fast. Beej, dear, I love you more than a fat kid loves his cheetos, in as nonsexual a way as I can get away with and still get free office supplies. But, like Martha Stewart, I digress. What I mean to say is, the fact that you're the admin. is no excuse for the behaviors that have been exhibited over the past week, the google post being the first of said incidents. We’re a part of something that you created all on your own, your baby, and in that sense, yes you  do  have the right to tell us when we’re doing something that’s bugging you. However, shouldn’t the fact that we’re your friends count for something too?   I guess that I’m sorry that Karine and I aren’t too fond of pea green, and that we’re not exactly regular updaters, but hell, you asked us to be apart of this and we were happy to do it.   The nub and jist of all this is, we want fair treatment. Not to take control, not to run you into the ground like a frightened rabbit, but fair treatment. Fair enough?

I DEMAND that you rid us of this filthy green and overly happy ripe-tangerine orange colour. DEMAND. OR I shall sic Teh Keener on you. And Teh Keener is tres mechante.

        ...  What was that? Beej calling me a poser? I'm not sure whether to be offended, or just to laugh hysterically. So, in compromise, I will do neither, but rather ignore it and tell you something random.  I have a stalker. Her name is Sara/h. I'm a little scared, if you'd like to know the truth. But let's not talk about that. On another note entirely, I caved and payed the three dollars to go to the Lincoln Center on Thursday. I felt a little dirty about it, but you know what Nickigeorge says: " Conform. Consume. Obey. " I also got duped into singing at the weird little Salon tomorrow. How, how do I do tevery day? Ahh, I'm such a good little drone. :DD  Speaking of drones...actually...this has nothing to do with drones whatsoever, but today was such a happy day. Oh how I adore PE. Oh how I adore volleyball. Oh how I adore being good at something for once. Mmm...nothing like flirting over sweat and stories of crater's in one's house,  non?  But, you know what I love the most? That beej will read this and have  nooooo  idea who I'm talking about, and it will likely drive him mad. Dear diary, why am I such a horrid person? Heehee. I've always wanted to say that. Now, end stupid post. I just needed to update, because I don't want to clean and this just seemed like the right thing to do. Night all.

It was just two posts ago that I believe I spied a "because"...and then oh look!!! On this very New Post Sheet...an automatic italicized Because.... And before that it said...BEEJ CONTROLS YOU!! USE RED HAT!!! and thus I have reached the conclusion that BEEJ uses red hat, which I have reached the conclusion allows admins to put whatever they *insert obscenity* feel like.   Aye, JDIS!!!!

        I feel a little bad that I couldn't be the first to tell anyone this, but knowing me, it'd be about twenty-four hours before I left before I breathed afinal word of it to anyone, so I suppose it's good that Beej was the first to say something.  Yes, in the physical sense, I  am  leaving. I act as though it's happening tomorrow, but it's not until sometime just after the fourth of July. It's almost fitting that I should be cast out into the great wild world on the holiday of independance. I've called this place my home, yet never felt totally welcome, for a decade now. That's a long damn time. Sure, I've moved around during that decade more times than I can count, but the point is that I've called this state my home for ten long years. I've made the only real friends that I possess here. I've written my first fanfic here, learned about sex on this place's playgrounds, and watched myself and those around me grow.   I have little bits of all of my friends burned into my mind. Things that I couldn't forget even if I wanted to. Like the way that Ben's eyes light up when he smiles, and how willing he is to give me the shirt off his back when it's cold out. And like the way that I feel when ever I can get Rosalie to wheeze when she laughs, and the way that she can't say the word "wang" with a straight face. Of course, I could spend an eternity and beyong just listing the things that I love just about these two people, but every moment that passes is one that I can't get back. That scares me a little. But I think what scares me more is a little question that nags me in the back of my head. Is there any little thing about me that'll be worth remembering? Do the little quirks in my character stick in their heads and make them smile the same way they have for me for as long as I can remember? Every part of me hopes so, only because I know how amazing they are. I know that they wouldn't let me fade away like the image of a young girl in a photograph, forsaken for the ancient image that looks upon it.  Heh. In ever conversation I have with Rosalie where the phone is dying, I always tell her, "I'm going to say goodbye now, then we can just keep talking. That way, I won't feel bad if the phone dies, because I'll have said goodbye." And so I did, and we would. So I suppose this is what this is. My phone is dying, my time is ending, but let's just keep talking as if nothing as ever happened, just so that I can hear the sound of your voice.

Anyway, around 7:15 Poncho came over to grab some Airsoft beebs, he wanted some more.

       First things first. Went to CSU Ropes today with Poncho and British. British was bitching. Poncho was getting mad at Joe English...er...British for throwing a shovel in a precision landing on his right brake handle. He was off it. You had to be there.  I read a lot of Kelly's LJ archives. I really wish I could have found those a LOT earlier. I read this and remembered.  "I was in the health room and crying (Ben was there...really embarrasing.)"  Kelly...my dear Kelz0rz...kel mah belle...don't ever feel embarrased in front of the personal concierge that I am. DO NOT EVER HESITATE TO CALL YOUR PERSONAL CONCIERGE THAT I HAPPEN TO BE.  Onto everything I want to say.  Kelly, Brittany, Jacque, Rosalie, Kels A., Christine...anyone else I forget. You're all incredibly beautiful. I want you to realize that so I don't have to smash that into your head with a 2x4.  Mrs. Khormann (Our "IT" bitch. She's not IT.) is a stupid whore. She's all right sometimes, but Nick and I know more about Linux then she knows about Windows. That says a lot.  I love my dad. A lot. I can't tell you how awesome it is to live with just my dad. (My parents are divorced and Ali lives in Greeley.)  I don't belive how some guys, some of my friends even can treat their girlfriends. I can't ever picture me doing some of the things they do. I almost want a girlfriend just to show the rest of the male population how to treat a woman.  Do I really care about grades? NO.  Currently caring about:  Kelly: 88% Path-E-Tech: 2% This post: 2% My dog: 2% More toner for my LaserJet 4: 4% Telling every single person I care about just how much I love them, in case I die or something: 4%  I think that's 100%...  I'm still a little mad about not reading Kel's life before. I feel like I shoulda done something...and I'm mad for how she's been treated by guys. I'm mad that I forgot all about my clarinet lesson after school today.  I need to re-network my SOHO.  I love you, Jacque. And Rosalie. And Brittany B. And Kelly. All of you. A lot. Oh, and Laura Willson. IN THE GROUP: WILLSON, JQ, KELZ0RZ, BRITTANY.  Ending the longest fucking post of my life, Your IT guy, -Mister Benjamin William Jones, I  Uh...

While it's not exactly moblogging, I am mobile amd I am blogging. so, today in band we were all up on stage playing, and Edie and Thomas have a duet for Awards concert on Tuesday. Edie plays clarinet, like me, but is first chair.(Unlike me.) She's infuckingcredible at playing. When I get home, I'm going to let Maddie out and then go to make some bike jumps somewhere with Poncho. There's nothing like typing on your Treo keyboard to keep you occupied while you walk home.

       It's so very nice to know that I can make a certain Kelly very happy just by downloading some songs for her. I don't mind doing it at all. KEL, I HOPE YOU SAW THAT.  Anyways.  Music, is free. Not free like money-wise, but free like open-source software. Sure, you paid money for the amplifiers and recording booths, but just because YOU (the band) think that you actually have a band doesn't mean you can go around putting a price tag on somthing that you can just do. Music isn't about making money, ask any band director that. Music is about having fun, it's about dedication to what you do, to all the people you can make happy just because you have a great voice, and you're really great at playing guitar. If the RIAA wants to bitch about music, here's what I see happening in the near future:  Scene: Beej walking to Kelly's to drop off her new ripped CD. He is whistling one of the songs that is ON the CD.  Beej: Whistle, whistle whistle... (Rustling is heard from behind the bushes, man jumps out with a gun) Man: FREEZE! THAT SONG YOU ARE WHISTLING IS COPYRIGHT 2005 BY THE RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA! YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF BOTH THE "FREE MUSIC SUCKS" LAW AND THE USA "PATRIOT ACT!" Beej: Wha? Man: SHUT UP, YOU TERRORIST!  See? WE HAVE TO KEEP MUSIC FREE.

Kelly needs music. Maybe I'll get it (illegally) for her. I'm mad because sprinklers and jobs. Let me tell you, the term "sprinkler" is thrown around. They DO NOT sprinkle. Oh, no.

It's great. Picture is  urlLink here.   I've been reading blogs randomly for the past...ten minutes. So far, it's a god-boy, two librarians and some kid named Mike who likes Pokemons.   I really like reading random blogs. I wonder...secretly, of course, if anyone other than my homies (Kel, Britt, Dylan, Teej, CH, JQ, ROZ...all my homies) read it. It's rather interesting, right?

       I just want to know. Why the fuck does no one comment on RTH? I mean, it's not all that hard, all those  faggot live journal users  competiting blog systems have comments, and everyone seems to do it, SO COMMENT THE FUCK UP, SLUTWHORES!  Just watched Broken Lizard's Club Dread. Funny fucking movie. Also, commented in some random chick's blog. Much coolness.  I stole this: Some people just don't get it  In my last entry, one commenter wrote that it's no big deal that random ID checks may be put in place in Boston. After all, what's the harm in showing ID to a friendly policeman who's only looking to protect us from the evildoers lurking about. We should worry about the "bigger stuff." But he misses the point. This IS the "bigger stuff". A nation doesn't become fascist or totalitarian overnight. It's a gradual process that is often welcomed by the country's population. "It can't happen here," they say. Well folks, it can and is happening here. And you of all people should understand what I'm talking about. To quote Ben Franklin, "Those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither liberty nor security."

(22:38:07) Christine: it's not like it's going to work (22:38:12) PEBKAC!: Then, press the "MUTE" button on the keyboard. (22:38:20) Christine: there isn't a mute button on the keyboard (22:38:31) Christine: wait ya there is (22:38:32) Christine: hold up  Needless to say, I eventually fixed it.

       That I am the craziest motherfucker on earth. Today, around about 7-7.5ish I biked up to her house and plopped down on her front lawn. I then proceeded to pull out the 'Shiba and my Treo's HotSync cord, just so I could freak The Gavin out for my presence on her front lawn. I think I freaked out the two cool people playing frisbee outfront more than her...or her mom. I think she was the most phazed from some deranged hacker kid on her property talkin' bout how he knows her daughter. She should have come and met me! Damn. Anyways, I'm fucking tired, have the Awards concert @ RMHS tommorow, and nothing to do all day TuezdAi. Seriously. JQ and ROZ have their "experiment" which, quite frankly, scares the living whores out of me. Hmm...I'm re-reading that title.   "KELLY MUST THINK!!"   She does.       She has to.

       You all get keys to the house, and the code to my basement. (Yes, there is an alarm.) That's just in case you need to stay somewhere for a while. It's not uber-cozy, but it has some food and drink, some money, maybe some blankets in the future. I don't even have to know you were there. I don't care...but if my dad comes down and sees you, just tell him to call me. Don't leave.  ANYWAY...  Had fun fishing today, reading  urlLink Kelly's  LiveJournal.  -beej

       Was officially the COOLEST FUCKING DAY ever. Blake, his brother, Ashley Sullivan and I all went up to Dixon res. to fish. Well, about 3:43 hours in, I decide to walk up to Kelly's. It's only about a mile or so. It was a really good walk. I walked across the street in front of where she lives, and call her to tell her, "Open your front door."  SO, SHE DID. In about the time it took me to get to her driveway. I think she was sorta kinda suprised. Turns out, we're (Blake and I) are insane. (Maybe because Blake was fishing with pudding. That was fun, though.) KEL, I WISH YOU COULD HAVE COME. YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED THE INSANITY.  ALSO: THIS FRIDAY: The plan is to GO CAMPING AT HORSETOOTH!! (FULL CAPACITY!!)  -beej

       It was really crazy. It's like this:  [start Ben'sDream.php] hehehe.  So, this lil' gAIM window pops into my head, and it's from Kelly. Naturally, it goes like this:  KELLY2: BEN!!! PEBKAC!: KELLY KELLY KEEELLLLYY! KELLY2: YOU DON'T THINK IM IMPORTANT! PEBKAC!: What? KELLY2: i wasnt in your blog day at all! (At this point, DreamBeej knows she's kidding, but DreamBeej feels bad.) PEBKAC!: KELLY! You know you're one of the most important peeps in my life!  (Then I woke up.) [/end]  So, now I feel obligated to say:   KELLY GAVIN, YOU ARE AT 98%. DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE VERYUCKINGIMPORTANT TO ME.   I've come to dislike Linkin Park...PUNK MY ASS. They think they're cool because they can  SCREAM  into a microphone. WOW! SUCH TALENT!

       So, got up, played some CS, and biked in around noon. Worked until one, when I told Mark that the PC was fucked beyond repair, and unless he had a backup (fat fucking chance) then the thing is going to shit.  "Oh, don't worry about it. I'm replacing it with a different PC I found up here!"  Great idea. Now, who's the A+ here?  Fag.  I hope the dick gets fired.

ME: Oh, goodie. New mail. *curses sendmail...*  Anyway, that's how my morning went. I got up about 9-9.5ish and went downstairs. I made muffins. Bannanana Nut Muffins. Damn, they were good. Then, did chores until around 11:15 and then showered. Got my ass into work. Mom, Paul, Andy, and Kirk were all there. Friendly people. I guess Mark (the CFO and wannabe-IT-guy) is in Greeley today. I worked until about noon, when I got hungry, and biked over to  urlLink Goodcents  for some lunch. SIXTEEN INCHES OF PURE KICKASSNESS. (JQ and ROZ will make a very bad joke of that. Just fucking watch.) Then I was full. Got back to work around 12.5 and continued to work. Re-installed Win95 about ten times. No joke. Finally worked on the C: again and everything SEEMED peachy until Paul clicks Netscape Communicator.  "Couldn't load OLE 2.0 or libraries are corrupt."  Fuck.  I hate Object. Er...OLE. Did a find for any sort of OLE file. Found a registry key and merged it with the current reg, and then everything SEEMED peachy. All the things that were missing OLE worked, and then it was time to move onto the...NETWORK CARD. Any IT guy who is worth his salt knows that networking 95 is like explaining TCP/IP to  urlLink Kelz0rz.  (That's rather difficult.) After very, very little poking around in Hardware, saw the damn card was just disabled. Re-enabled it and re-booted. Once again. Everything SEEMED peachy. Tried Netscape. Upon loading whatever homepage there was, the Java Security console pops up, along with a GPF.  "Netscape has preformed an illegal operation and will be shut down by Windows."  Fuck.  I hate GPF's. Er...General Protection Faults. Did a find for the .DLL it was assfucking and found out that it was 4.5, or, quitting time. Instead of taking my valuable time waiting for my mother to get off her PC, (There is only two workstations downstairs, with two offices and the lobby...there should be FOUR. There will BE FOUR.) I decides to take the file home and try to edit it. Wait, why don't I just replace it?  WILL BEN THE FEARLESS IT GUY SAVE THE OLD DELL?  FIND OUT IN THE NEXT POST, AND WED. WENT...!

       It's been almost six whole days since I last posted. Not feeling like writing right now, either. I just had to do a sample writing for ITtoolbox blogs. I might be doing a fictional blog for them! Cool, right? You're damn right! You might have noticed I changed the name of RTH to "200 OK" and it has a meaning. (Helen, it has a NAME!)  You know how at the beginning of a link it has HTTP?  That stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. HTTP has a bunch of different codes for web pages. If it's not there, it's a 404 Not Found. If you're not allowed, it's a 403 Forbidden. Things like that.  BUT! If the page loads normal, the response from the server that is hosting the site is none other than:   200 OK   That means your page loaded normal, and you should never see the 200 OK code. It's good.  That's why I renamed it 200 OK. Because it's so nerdy, yet so fucking cool.  WORLD WIDE WAR DRIVE FOUR IS ON SUNDAY.

       So, I've taken apart Project Instant Tux (the Computer-In-A-Projector Project) and modded the computer into a PlayStation 2 box. The actual BOX. Not the unit. The BOX. Pictures up now.   That's just the Beta version. The lights, power switch, fan, and reset aren't modded in yet.   That gaping hole where the lights and switches are is where the fan is to be located.   Basically a better picture of the gaping hole. You can see the edge of the power supply, too!   The Power Supply. You can see "Project Instant Tux" written on it from the old Project.   The VERY front of the box, the part that I tried to preserve.   The best-looking picture. The warning says something about a spyware program not properly installed... =]   The FINAL resting place for the PS2 Server. (Still known as ServerTwo.)   Lastly, the terribly terrible BSOD! (Blue Screen Of Death)  Happy am I, for JQ and I are supposed to go to dinner (on my bill, of course. Any other way would make me look like a dirty queer.)  Peace be with you.

       The 16mm PC project.   Step One: Take an old Lafayette Instruments Model 00100 16mm Reel Analyzer and gut the projector.  Step Two: Take a PC and crack the case, then gut it.  Step Three: Insert guts of PC into cavity of Model 00100.  The finished product should look like:                 That's my favorite PC now.

       Well...in order to get songs for TheKelMixThree, I had to go...Napster... Yeah... I'm done with pirating, all the songs get RIAA'd.... I FUCKING HATE THE RIAA. LEARN TO SHARE, MOTHERFUCKERS!!! AAHAHAHAHA!! Anyways, I got four extra songs for me: Orgy, Fiction (Dreams in Digital) Beastie Boys, Ch-Check It Out The Chemical Brothers, Leave Home Juno Reactor, Nitrogen Part 2  So, one Rock, one Rap, and two Techno.

"Feelings" by The Offspring. Not towards anyone, but it's on the "Beastiecana mix." Yes. It goes: Offspring on all odd # tracks, and Beastie on even # tracks. It's a playlist, because I'm just so l33t like that...  Well, in three years, I'm moving to Saskatoon. Here's the  urlLink apartments  I'm moving to. I have reasons for moving, number one being,  I don't like our government.    Whoops. Gotta go.

       I  STILL  do custom-built PC's and upgrades. Consider that Computer renaissance makes one for $2300, I can make the same PC for under $1500. Not bad at all. I still do repairs, and I still do case modding (think cold cathode BLUE! lights and fans, and I still do Linux, and I still offer 24/7 tech support for a really fscking' reasonable price, and I still think you should see me before  being screwed by  buying from Dell, and I still think that PC manufacturers suck, because I guarantee my work for life. Not parts, but I'll try. So please, SHOP FORT COLLINS FIRST!!

       Woot! You know that ViewSonic VP150m LCD panel display that I always use for my crazy computer projects? I finally decided, IT MUST BE USED ON THE COMPAQ! I tried it once or twice before, but it looked really shitty. Then, I got the VP150m drivers, and set the res to 1024x768x24@60Hz, and the display IS SO FUCKING CLEAR. Then, I go online and read that the VP150m is in the "Professional Series" (Think! ViewSonic PRO 150 multisync) It goes E2 series, Graphic Series, X Series, Pro Series (WOOOT) and A Series. It's a real clear monitor. The best part would have to be the true colors. That means that if the picture is all-black, then every single live pixel will be the exact same black. Anyways, it's really awesome. Ken Hinds and his kids came over, we went swimming, and then I got on Fedora Core 1 (YARROW) 2.4.22.nptl and did some updates, I'm looking to get Kismet up and running soon. Also, in three years, (that's when I'm 18) I'm moving to Saskatoon. th4t's ju5t s0 my l33t 4zz c4n pwn j00 cuz j00 r teh f4gZ0rZ!!!!111  Random.  Kel(z0rz) you better NOT take offense to that.

       Sorry. I forgot to be posting to this here "weblog." (My favorite Slashdot signature is "Look, maw! I done posted on that there Slashdot!") Slashdot kicks ass. So,  urlLink Kelz0rz  returned today, and this made me rather happy in the happy sort of way. BUT, she lost her fscking CD's on the plane, which meant that I made and delivered (in a UPS NextDay envelope) with markings and a TransitScan and Tracking Number and URGENT: SUNDAY OR HOLIDAY DELIVERY and "DEN" marked on it. Looked very important. Around six or so, I biked over to Dimmer's and me and Dick, Steve, Allison, and my father all sat aroud and watched people blow shit up in the air. It was fun. We then rode home and now I'm gonna take a shower 'cause I smell like DEET and it's not a very good smell. Have fun doing whatever.

       So, we went down to Porter (mah dad's work) and turns out this dood who does firearms training wants us to do a class! We took a self-defense class from him once, that was kick-ASS! That shootin' thing would rock! So then, we drove to Papa's Chicken in Loveland also, ate a very-leet meal and then took off to Carmike to watch Will Smith drive an Audi in a movie based off Issac Asimov's "I, Robot." It had US Robotics, Audi,  and Converse in it, along with Will Smith and some robots killing people. It's a great movie that has to do with the Three Laws of Robotics. I hope you know them. Anyways, we got home and I re-arranged some stuff in my server room, I have to plan on getting those two old 486's (they're Vectras!) to do SOMETHING so they don't just get older...and older...and older. I could make them into print servers! (Maybe. I'd have to buy a new parallel cable, because my printers are either USB or CAT5E.)  Anyways, go see "I, Robot!"  [Music:]None!

Kelly, why is it SO STRANGE and FUNNY that I'm making you a PC? It's an older one, and it's literally in a cardboard box, but it's pretty leet and whatnot. Blake came over today, then Jeremy, and then we went up to Rolland Moore to airsoft each other. TJ and Kel couldn't come. =[ Also, I need to get with the Allnutt thing...whoopsies.

       Dude...Kjell and Jackso, outta MN. They have a lot of really good songs. Sometimes I feel like I wanna do that for her. Y'know, the girl I talked about earlier. Although, she deserves  so  much more than just a single rose. Sigh... She's so...sigh... Lyric time!  Kjell and Jackso Coming Home  "Tired of being on the road, I'm coming home tonight. I may walk all night, but I'll make it home before sunrise.  Don't wait up for me, I've got a ways to go. Broken, and tired, but I will make it home.  I'm coming home, I'm gonna bring you a single rose. It might not be much,  but it is all I've got. I can't afford much else, and I've run out of clean socks."      God.

       I was originally planning on writing some elaborate post about how awesome camping is until your $5.00 tent starts to get wet because the rain fly sucks, but then I realized that complaining never helped me before. Right now, I just feel like writing, so I'll probably just have some long elaborate post in general. Well, we got home around 8:00 because that's when the rain let up. We got everything into Blake's Jeep, and it was all soaking. We pulled it all out, organized it...and Joel walked over to his Dad's house. You know what bothers me? Since Dumpster is a brand name, you have to capatilize it...like Dumpster. Like saying Kleenex or Xerox. Dumpster. He walked around to the back of the building and threw the trash into the Dumpster and left. It's just crazy. Anyways, we got to Blake's and cleaned up and ate and watched some gay-ass show on MTV about a fat chick who thought she could be black. Got my stuff together and Blake dropped me off. Slept. For six hours. I didn't sleep more than thirty minutes all night, no joke. So, then I got up around 4:30 and put my clothes in the dryer. I got dinner started. It was some goooood Durkee's (that's hot sauce) chicken, you just baste the chicken in the durkee's and slap it in the oven for 35 minutes at 325 degrees and it comes out real nice. I did have to use meat tenderizer on it because it was frozen chicken, but wasn't bad in the end. So, we got to the campground yesterday, and my dad said that it was gonna rain all day yesterday, suprise, it STOPPED until around seven, so we got in the tent and got online, I got to talk to  urlLink Kelly!  online, she's always kickass fun to talk to and such, but I guess she was having problems with AIM. (no suprise there.) Y'know what's funny? Windows is so insecure because it's closed-source. Linux is so secure because it's OPEN-SOURCE. SSL encryption? Almost impossible to hack, and it's roots are open source. How about that? The most secure things are open. Crazy. Anyways, we talked and shit until about nine, nine thirty, and then we went outside. We were on South Bay, and man, I said, "Damn...Looks like we got nuked!" and then Joel saw some headlights and was all, "Look! It's the Russians, they're surveying the damage!" and then, we hung out in the gravel parking area and this guy pulled up in a Saturn. Here's how the conversation went:  Me: "Hey, how you doing?" Him: "Oh, not bad, you know, a little wet, but can't complain." Me:  Points at campground post  "Is this your grounds?" Him: "Yup." Me: "Nice." Joel:  Points at something  "What's that?"  Anyways, we walk back over to our tent and we're just chillin' outside. I look over, and he's pitching his tent in complete darkness, maybe 13% exposure total light. I ask, "Hey, you need a lantern, man?" and he says, "Naw, I've done this plenty of times in the dark. Thanks, though." Then, we all got back in our tent and just talked until Blake and Joel fell asleep. I stayed up, closed my eyes, thought about: -School! -Kelly! -Jacque and Moving Day! -Movies! - urlLink FCAL!  -People and Things in general!  Then, around five or so in the morning, I hear the guy get out and start to take down his tent, once again in pure darkness, maybe 7% exposure. I go outside, because I had to piss like a pregnant woman... Anyways, we all got up around seven and started to clean up and talk and shit. All things considered, we had a really awesome time, and we're gonna go up again at least twice before summer is over. Anyways, nice to keep you all in the know, and by the way, it's really fun to type "a href="http://fcal.netfirms.com"FCAL!"/a" at a blazing 47 WPM. My mommie, the Office Manager at Allnutt, types over 100 WPM, sometimes the keyboard on the typewriter jams there, and it's really pretty funny. Anyways, lates for now. Hmm... I've been saying "Lates!" instead of "Later." ever since Counter-Strike. I don't even play CS anymore anyways. Lates!

       25 pre-printed labels to Kelly...Not joking. I have 25 UPS NextDay Document Folder-sized labels for the envelopes I got. The whole pre-printed label thing is for the CD's and other random things that Kelly gets. Anyways, Blake came over and helped me clean, so we can go camping this Thursday. My dad seems a little worried about the whole thing, and I can't blame him. We're two teenage boys going five miles away for 24 hours...Anyways, I have plans to eat dinner and go swimming and  even  update my blog via my laptop and TMo. (That's T-Mobile to you non-SE's.

       And she's really pretty. I think she knows she is, but she denies it. She's just so fucking awesome. She's fucking incredible. She's the best. Gah.

WHEN will I be able to show the world (and this girl!) how to respectfully respect and treat ladies, the oh-so-awesome part of the world? (Yes. I am aware that I used world twice in the sentence.)
