      http://www.republicart.net/disc/institution/sheikh01_en.htm   When thinking about art production and representation, it is therefore crucial to negotiate these terms both individually and in relation to each other. And just as contemporary art practices have shown that neither the work nor the spectator can be formally defined and fixed, we have in recent years come to realize that the conception of a public sphere, the arena in which one meet and engage, is likewise dematerialised and/or expanded. We no longer conceive of the public sphere as an entity, as one location and/or formation as suggested in Habermas' famous description of the bourgeois public sphere. Instead, we have to think of the public sphere as fragmented, as consisting of a number of spaces and/or formations that sometimes connect, sometimes close off, and that are in conflictual and contradictory relations to each other. And we have, through the efforts of Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, come to realise that our interactions as subjects with the public spheres are dependent on experiences. There not only exists public spheres (and ideals here-of), but also counter-publics.

      My Beef With Big Media How government protects big media--and shuts out upstarts like me. By Ted Turner [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0407.turner.html]   In the late 1960s, when Turner Communications was a business of billboards and radio stations and I was spending much of my energy ocean racing, a UHF-TV station came up for sale in Atlanta. It was losing $50,000 a month and its programs were viewed by fewer than 5 percent of the market.  I acquired it.  When I moved to buy a second station in Charlotte--this one worse than the first--my accountant quit in protest, and the company's board vetoed the deal. So I mortgaged my house and bought it myself. The Atlanta purchase turned into the Superstation; the Charlotte purchase--when I sold it 10 years later--gave me the capital to launch CNN. Both purchases played a role in revolutionizing television. Both required a streak of independence and a taste for risk. And neither could happen today. In the current climate of consolidation, independent broadcasters simply don't survive for long. That's why we haven't seen a new generation of people like me or even Rupert Murdoch--independent television upstarts who challenge the big boys and force the whole industry to compete and change.  It's not that there aren't entrepreneurs eager to make their names and fortunes in broadcasting if given the chance. If nothing else, the 1990s dot-com boom showed that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well in America, with plenty of investors willing to put real money into new media ventures. The difference is that Washington has changed the rules of the game. When I was getting into the television business, lawmakers and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took seriously the commission's mandate to promote diversity, localism, and competition in the media marketplace. They wanted to make sure that the big, established networks--CBS, ABC, NBC--wouldn't forever dominate what the American public could watch on TV. They wanted independent producers to thrive. They wanted more people to be able to own TV stations. They believed in the value of competition.  So when the FCC received a glut of applications for new television stations after World War II, the agency set aside dozens of channels on the new UHF spectrum so independents could get a foothold in television. That helped me get my start 35 years ago. Congress also passed a law in 1962 requiring that TVs be equipped to receive both UHF and VHF channels. That's how I was able to compete as a UHF station, although it was never easy. (I used to tell potential advertisers that our UHF viewers were smarter than the rest, because you had to be a genius just to figure out how to tune us in.) And in 1972, the FCC ruled that cable TV operators could import distant signals. That's how we were able to beam our Atlanta station to homes throughout the South. Five years later, with the help of an RCA satellite, we were sending our signal across the nation, and the Superstation was born.  That was then.  Today, media companies are more concentrated than at any time over the past 40 years, thanks to a continual loosening of ownership rules by Washington. The media giants now own not only broadcast networks and local stations; they also own the cable companies that pipe in the signals of their competitors and the studios that produce most of the programming. To get a flavor of how consolidated the industry has become, consider this: In 1990, the major broadcast networks--ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox--fully or partially owned just 12.5 percent of the new series they aired. By 2000, it was 56.3 percent. Just two years later, it had surged to 77.5 percent.  In this environment, most independent media firms either get gobbled up by one of the big companies or driven out of business altogether. Yet instead of balancing the rules to give independent broadcasters a fair chance in the market, Washington continues to tilt the playing field to favor the biggest players. Last summer, the FCC passed another round of sweeping pro-consolidation rules that, among other things, further raised the cap on the number of TV stations a company can own.  In the media, as in any industry, big corporations play a vital role, but so do small, emerging ones. When you lose small businesses, you lose big ideas. People who own their own businesses are their own bosses. They are independent thinkers. They know they can't compete by imitating the big guys--they have to innovate, so they're less obsessed with earnings than they are with ideas. They are quicker to seize on new technologies and new product ideas. They steal market share from the big companies, spurring them to adopt new approaches. This process promotes competition, which leads to higher product and service quality, more jobs, and greater wealth. It's called capitalism.  But without the proper rules, healthy capitalist markets turn into sluggish oligopolies, and that is what's happening in media today. Large corporations are more profit-focused and risk-averse. They often kill local programming because it's expensive, and they push national programming because it's cheap--even if their decisions run counter to local interests and community values. Their managers are more averse to innovation because they're afraid of being fired for an idea that fails. They prefer to sit on the sidelines, waiting to buy the businesses of the risk-takers who succeed.  Unless we have a climate that will allow more independent media companies to survive, a dangerously high percentage of what we see--and what we don't see--will be shaped by the profit motives and political interests of large, publicly traded conglomerates. The economy will suffer, and so will the quality of our public life. Let me be clear: As a business proposition, consolidation makes sense. The moguls behind the mergers are acting in their corporate interests and playing by the rules. We just shouldn't have those rules. They make sense for a corporation. But for a society, it's like over-fishing the oceans. When the independent businesses are gone, where will the new ideas come from? We have to do more than keep media giants from growing larger; they're already too big. We need a new set of rules that will break these huge companies to pieces.  The big squeeze  In the 1970s, I became convinced that a 24-hour all-news network could make money, and perhaps even change the world. But when I invited two large media corporations to invest in the launch of CNN, they turned me down. I couldn't believe it. Together we could have launched the network for a fraction of what it would have taken me alone; they had all the infrastructure, contacts, experience, knowledge. When no one would go in with me, I risked my personal wealth to start CNN. Soon after our launch in 1980, our expenses were twice what we had expected and revenues half what we had projected. Our losses were so high that our loans were called in. I refinanced at 18 percent interest, up from 9, and stayed just a step ahead of the bankers. Eventually, we not only became profitable, but also changed the nature of news--from watching something that happened to watching it as it happened. But even as CNN was getting its start, the climate for independent broadcasting was turning hostile. This trend began in 1984, when the FCC raised the number of stations a single entity could own from seven--where it had been capped since the 1950s--to 12. A year later, it revised its rule again, adding a national audience-reach cap of 25 percent to the 12 station limit--meaning media companies were prohibited from owning TV stations that together reached more than 25 percent of the national audience. In 1996, the FCC did away with numerical caps altogether and raised the audience-reach cap to 35 percent. This wasn't necessarily bad for Turner Broadcasting; we had already achieved scale. But seeing these rules changed was like watching someone knock down the ladder I had already climbed.  Meanwhile, the forces of consolidation focused their attention on another rule, one that restricted ownership of content. Throughout the 1980s, network lobbyists worked to overturn the so-called Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, or fin-syn, which had been put in place in 1970, after federal officials became alarmed at the networks' growing control over programming. As the FCC wrote in the fin-syn decision: "The power to determine form and content rests only in the three networks and is exercised extensively and exclusively by them, hourly and daily." In 1957, the commission pointed out, independent companies had produced a third of all network shows; by 1968, that number had dropped to 4 percent. The rules essentially forbade networks from profiting from reselling programs that they had already aired.  This had the result of forcing networks to sell off their syndication arms, as CBS did with Viacom in 1973. Once networks no longer produced their own content, new competition was launched, creating fresh opportunities for independents.  For a time, Hollywood and its production studios were politically strong enough to keep the fin-syn rules in place. But by the early 1990s, the networks began arguing that their dominance had been undercut by the rise of independent broadcasters, cable networks, and even videocassettes, which they claimed gave viewers enough choice to make fin-syn unnecessary. The FCC ultimately agreed--and suddenly the broadcast networks could tell independent production studios, "We won't air it unless we own it." The networks then bought up the weakened studios or were bought out by their own syndication arms, the way Viacom turned the tables on CBS, buying the network in 2000. This silenced the major political opponents of consolidation.  Even before the repeal of fin-syn, I could see that the trend toward consolidation spelled trouble for independents like me. In a climate of consolidation, there would be only one sure way to win: bring a broadcast network, production studios, and cable and satellite systems under one roof. If you didn't have it inside, you'd have to get it outside--and that meant, increasingly, from a large corporation that was competing with you. It's difficult to survive when your suppliers are owned by your competitors. I had tried and failed to buy a major broadcast network, but the repeal of fin-syn turned up the pressure. Since I couldn't buy a network, I bought MGM to bring more content in-house, and I kept looking for other ways to gain scale. In the end, I found the only way to stay competitive was to merge with Time Warner and relinquish control of my companies.  Today, the only way for media companies to survive is to own everything up and down the media chain--from broadcast and cable networks to the sitcoms, movies, and news broadcasts you see on those stations; to the production studios that make them; to the cable, satellite, and broadcast systems that bring the programs to your television set; to the Web sites you visit to read about those programs; to the way you log on to the Internet to view those pages. Big media today wants to own the faucet, pipeline, water, and the reservoir. The rain clouds come next.  Supersizing networks  Throughout the 1990s, media mergers were celebrated in the press and otherwise seemingly ignored by the American public. So, it was easy to assume that media consolidation was neither controversial nor problematic. But then a funny thing happened.  In the summer of 2003, the FCC raised the national audience-reach cap from 35 percent to 45 percent. The FCC also allowed corporations to own a newspaper and a TV station in the same market and permitted corporations to own three TV stations in the largest markets, up from two, and two stations in medium-sized markets, up from one. Unexpectedly, the public rebelled. Hundreds of thousands of citizens complained to the FCC. Groups from the National Organization for Women to the National Rifle Association demanded that Congress reverse the ruling. And like-minded lawmakers, including many long-time opponents of media consolidation, took action, pushing the cap back down to 35, until--under strong White House pressure--it was revised back up to 39 percent. This June, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit threw out the rules that would have allowed corporations to own more television and radio stations in a single market, let stand the higher 39 percent cap, and also upheld the rule permitting a corporation to own a TV station and a newspaper in the same market; then, it sent the issues back to the same FCC that had pushed through the pro-consolidation rules in the first place.  In reaching its 2003 decision, the FCC did not argue that its policies would advance its core objectives of diversity, competition, and localism. Instead, it justified its decision by saying that there was already a lot of diversity, competition, and localism in the media--so it wouldn't hurt if the rules were changed to allow more consolidation. Their decision reads: "Our current rules inadequately account for the competitive presence of cable, ignore the diversity-enhancing value of the Internet, and lack any sound bases for a national audience reach cap." Let's pick that assertion apart.  First, the "competitive presence of cable" is a mirage. Broadcast networks have for years pointed to their loss of prime-time viewers to cable networks--but they are losing viewers to cable networks that they themselves own. Ninety percent of the top 50 cable TV stations are owned by the same parent companies that own the broadcast networks. Yes, Disney's ABC network has lost viewers to cable networks. But it's losing viewers to cable networks like Disney's ESPN, Disney's ESPN2, and Disney's Disney Channel. The media giants are getting a deal from Congress and the FCC because their broadcast networks are losing share to their own cable networks. It's a scam.  Second, the decision cites the "diversity-enhancing value of the Internet." The FCC is confusing diversity with variety. The top 20 Internet news sites are owned by the same media conglomerates that control the broadcast and cable networks. Sure, a hundred-person choir gives you a choice of voices, but they're all singing the same song. The FCC says that we have more media choices than ever before. But only a few corporations decide what we can choose. That is not choice. That's like a dictator deciding what candidates are allowed to stand for parliamentary elections, and then claiming that the people choose their leaders. Different voices do not mean different viewpoints, and these huge corporations all have the same viewpoint--they want to shape government policy in a way that helps them maximize profits, drive out competition, and keep getting bigger.  Because the new technologies have not fundamentally changed the market, it's wrong for the FCC to say that there are no "sound bases for a national audience-reach cap." The rationale for such a cap is the same as it has always been. If there is a limit to the number of TV stations a corporation can own, then the chance exists that after all the corporations have reached this limit, there may still be some stations left over to be bought and run by independents. A lower limit would encourage the entry of independents and promote competition. A higher limit does the opposite.  Triple blight  The loss of independent operators hurts both the media business and its citizen-customers. When the ownership of these firms passes to people under pressure to show quick financial results in order to justify the purchase, the corporate emphasis instantly shifts from taking risks to taking profits. When that happens, quality suffers, localism suffers, and democracy itself suffers.  Loss of Quality  The Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans exerts a negative influence on society, because it discourages people who want to climb up the list from giving more money to charity. The Nielsen ratings are dangerous in a similar way--because they scare companies away from good shows that don't produce immediate blockbuster ratings. The producer Norman Lear once asked, "You know what ruined television?" His answer: when The New York Times began publishing the Nielsen ratings. "That list every week became all anyone cared about."  When all companies are quarterly earnings-obsessed, the market starts punishing companies that aren't yielding an instant return. This not only creates a big incentive for bogus accounting, but also it inhibits the kind of investment that builds economic value. America used to know this. We used to be a nation of farmers. You can't plant something today and harvest tomorrow. Had Turner Communications been required to show earnings growth every quarter, we never would have purchased those first two TV stations.  When CNN reported to me, if we needed more money for Kosovo or Baghdad, we'd find it. If we had to bust the budget, we busted the budget. We put journalism first, and that's how we built CNN into something the world wanted to watch. I had the power to make these budget decisions because they were my companies. I was an independent entrepreneur who controlled the majority of the votes and could run my company for the long term. Top managers in these huge media conglomerates run their companies for the short term. After we sold Turner Broadcasting to Time Warner, we came under such earnings pressure that we had to cut our promotion budget every year at CNN to make our numbers. Media mega-mergers inevitably lead to an overemphasis on short-term earnings.  You can see this overemphasis in the spread of reality television. Shows like "Fear Factor" cost little to produce--there are no actors to pay and no sets to maintain--and they get big ratings. Thus, American television has moved away from expensive sitcoms and on to cheap thrills. We've gone from "Father Knows Best" to "Who Wants to Marry My Dad?", and from "My Three Sons" to "My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance."  The story of Grant Tinker and Mary Tyler Moore's production studio, MTM, helps illustrate the point. When the company was founded in 1969, Tinker and Moore hired the best writers they could find and then left them alone--and were rewarded with some of the best shows of the 1970s. But eventually, MTM was bought by a company that imposed budget ceilings and laid off employees. That company was later purchased by Rev. Pat Robertson; then, he was bought out by Fox. Exit "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." Enter "The Littlest Groom."  Loss of localism  Consolidation has also meant a decline in the local focus of both news and programming. After analyzing 23,000 stories on 172 news programs over five years, the Project for Excellence in Journalism found that big media news organizations relied more on syndicated feeds and were more likely to air national stories with no local connection. That's not surprising. Local coverage is expensive, and thus will tend be a casualty in the quest for short-term earnings. In 2002, Fox Television bought Chicago's Channel 50 and eliminated all of the station's locally produced shows. One of the cancelled programs (which targeted pre-teens) had scored a perfect rating for educational content in a 1999 University of Pennsylvania study, according to The Chicago Tribune. That accolade wasn't enough to save the program. Once the station's ownership changed, so did its mission and programming.  Loss of localism also undercuts the public-service mission of the media, and this can have dangerous consequences. In early 2002, when a freight train derailed near Minot, N.D., releasing a cloud of anhydrous ammonia over the town, police tried to call local radio stations, six of which are owned by radio mammoth Clear Channel Communications. According to news reports, it took them over an hour to reach anyone--no one was answering the Clear Channel phone. By the next day, 300 people had been hospitalized, many partially blinded by the ammonia. Pets and livestock died. And Clear Channel continued beaming its signal from headquarters in San Antonio, Texas--some 1,600 miles away.  Loss of democratic debate  When media companies dominate their markets, it undercuts our democracy. Justice Hugo Black, in a landmark media-ownership case in 1945, wrote: "The First Amendment rests on the assumption that the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public." These big companies are not antagonistic; they do billions of dollars in business with each other. They don't compete; they cooperate to inhibit competition. You and I have both felt the impact. I felt it in 1981, when CBS, NBC, and ABC all came together to try to keep CNN from covering the White House. You've felt the impact over the past two years, as you saw little news from ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, Fox, or CNN on the FCC's actions. In early 2003, the Pew Research Center found that 72 percent of Americans had heard "nothing at all" about the proposed FCC rule changes. Why? One never knows for sure, but it must have been clear to news directors that the more they covered this issue, the harder it would be for their corporate bosses to get the policy result they wanted.  A few media conglomerates now exercise a near-monopoly over television news. There is always a risk that news organizations can emphasize or ignore stories to serve their corporate purpose. But the risk is far greater when there are no independent competitors to air the side of the story the corporation wants to ignore. More consolidation has often meant more news-sharing. But closing bureaus and downsizing staff have more than economic consequences. A smaller press is less capable of holding our leaders accountable. When Viacom merged two news stations it owned in Los Angeles, reports The American Journalism Review, "field reporters began carrying microphones labeled KCBS on one side and KCAL on the other." This was no accident. As the Viacom executive in charge told The Los Angeles Business Journal: "In this duopoly, we should be able to control the news in the marketplace."  This ability to control the news is especially worrisome when a large media organization is itself the subject of a news story. Disney's boss, after buying ABC in 1995, was quoted in LA Weekly as saying, "I would prefer ABC not cover Disney." A few days later, ABC killed a "20/20" story critical of the parent company.  But networks have also been compromised when it comes to non-news programs which involve their corporate parent's business interests. General Electric subsidiary NBC Sports raised eyebrows by apologizing to the Chinese government for Bob Costas's reference to China's "problems with human rights" during a telecast of the Atlanta Olympic Games. China, of course, is a huge market for GE products.  Consolidation has given big media companies new power over what is said not just on the air, but off it as well. Cumulus Media banned the Dixie Chicks on its 42 country music stations for 30 days after lead singer Natalie Maines criticized President Bush for the war in Iraq. It's hard to imagine Cumulus would have been so bold if its listeners had more of a choice in country music stations. And Disney recently provoked an uproar when it prevented its subsidiary Miramax from distributing Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11. As a senior Disney executive told The New York Times: "It's not in the interest of any major corporation to be dragged into a highly charged partisan political battle." Follow the logic, and you can see what lies ahead: If the only media companies are major corporations, controversial and dissenting views may not be aired at all.  Naturally, corporations say they would never suppress speech. But it's not their intentions that matter; it's their capabilities. Consolidation gives them more power to tilt the news and cut important ideas out of the public debate. And it's precisely that power that the rules should prevent.  Independents' day  This is a fight about freedom--the freedom of independent entrepreneurs to start and run a media business, and the freedom of citizens to get news, information, and entertainment from a wide variety of sources, at least some of which are truly independent and not run by people facing the pressure of quarterly earnings reports. No one should underestimate the danger. Big media companies want to eliminate all ownership limits. With the removal of these limits, immense media power will pass into the hands of a very few corporations and individuals.  What will programming be like when it's produced for no other purpose than profit? What will news be like when there are no independent news organizations to go after stories the big corporations avoid? Who really wants to find out? Safeguarding the welfare of the public cannot be the first concern of a large publicly traded media company. Its job is to seek profits. But if the government writes the rules in a way that encourages the entry into the market of entrepreneurs--men and women with big dreams, new ideas, and a willingness to take long-term risks--the economy will be stronger, and the country will be better off.  I freely admit: When I was in the media business, especially after the federal government changed the rules to favor large companies, I tried to sweep the board, and I came within one move of owning every link up and down the media chain. Yet I felt then, as I do now, that the government was not doing its job. The role of the government ought to be like the role of a referee in boxing, keeping the big guys from killing the little guys. If the little guy gets knocked down, the referee should send the big guy to his corner, count the little guy out, and then help him back up. But today the government has cast down its duty, and media competition is less like boxing and more like professional wrestling: The wrestler and the referee are both kicking the guy on the canvas.  At this late stage, media companies have grown so large and powerful, and their dominance has become so detrimental to the survival of small, emerging companies, that there remains only one alternative: bust up the big conglomerates. We've done this before: to the railroad trusts in the first part of the 20th century, to Ma Bell more recently. Indeed, big media itself was cut down to size in the 1970s, and a period of staggering innovation and growth followed. Breaking up the reconstituted media conglomerates may seem like an impossible task when their grip on the policy-making process in Washington seems so sure. But the public's broad and bipartisan rebellion against the FCC's pro-consolidation decisions suggests something different. Politically, big media may again be on the wrong side of history--and up against a country unwilling to lose its independents.

      http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/11/magazine/11FOX.html?pagewanted=print&position=   July 11, 2004 By ROBERT S. BOYNTON  The offices of Robert Greenwald Productions occupy a slightly rundown, horseshoe-shaped building in Los Angeles, just down the street from Culver Studios, the legendary movie facility where ''Gone With the Wind'' and ''Citizen Kane'' were filmed. Back in the day, the R.G.P. building, then a motel, was used by studio executives for liaisons with starlets and mistresses. Though no longer a Hollywood love nest, it still has a whiff of the illicit about it -- and still operates in the shadow of several corporate studios.   Robert Greenwald, a 58-year-old film producer and director with a number of commercially respectable B-list movies under his belt, has always tried to imbue his work with a left-leaning political sensibility. R.G.P. has been involved in the making of some 50 movies, including ''Steal This Movie,'' a 2000 film based on the life of the radical activist (and Greenwald's friend) Abbie Hoffman, and ''Crooked E,'' a satirical TV movie about Enron's collapse that CBS broadcast last year. Greenwald is presumably the only director in Hollywood to adorn his workspace with a quotation from Walt Whitman's ''Leaves of Grass'': ''The attitude of great poets is to cheer up slaves and horrify despots.''   One morning in late May, I visited Greenwald at his studio to watch the making of his latest documentary, ''Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism,'' which will have its premiere this Tuesday at the New School University in New York. Over the past couple of years, Greenwald has developed a ''guerrilla'' method of documentary filmmaking, creating timely political films on short schedules and small budgets and then promoting and selling them on DVD through partnerships with grass-roots political organizations like MoveOn.org. The process, in addition to being swift, allows him to avoid the problems of risk-averse studios and finicky distributors. His 2003 film ''Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War,'' a documentary that was critical of the Bush administration's drive to war, took only four and a half months from conception to completion, coming out on DVD last November as public doubts about the war began to grow.   ''Outfoxed'' has been made in secret. The film is an obsessively researched expose of the ways in which Fox News, as Greenwald sees it, distorts its coverage to serve the conservative political agenda of its owner, the media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. It features interviews with former Fox employees, leaked policy memos written by Fox executives and extensive footage from Fox News, which Greenwald is using without the network's permission. The result is an unwavering argument against Fox News that combines the leftist partisan vigor of a Michael Moore film with the sober tone and delivery of a PBS special. A large portion of the film's $300,000 budget came in the form of contributions in the range of $80,000 from both MoveOn and the Center for American Progress, the liberal policy organization founded by John Podesta, the former chief of staff for Bill Clinton; Greenwald, who is not looking to earn any money from the project, provided the rest.   A week after its New School premiere, the film will be shown throughout the country in hundreds of small local screenings, arranged by MoveOn, where people will be able to watch and discuss it. Though the existence of ''Outfoxed'' has been quietly publicized, its particular nature and content have been closely guarded for fear, Greenwald says, that Fox would try to stop the film's release by filing a copyright-infringement lawsuit. Nobody has ever made a critical documentary about a media company that uses as much footage without permission as Greenwald has, and the legal precedents governing the ''fair use'' of such material, while theoretically strong, are not well established in case law. He has retained the services of several intellectual-property lawyers and experts to help him navigate the ambiguous legal terrain. (A Fox News representative, in response to several phone calls, said that no one in the legal department was available to comment on copyright issues.)   If Greenwald is lucky, Fox will be gun-shy, having earned nothing but public chiding when it brought a trademark lawsuit last year against Al Franken, whose book ''Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right'' ironically appropriated Fox News's signature phrase ''fair and balanced.'' (The judge dismissed the suit as ''wholly without merit.'') But if Fox does sue, the fate of Greenwald's film is uncertain. Dennis Reiff, an insurance broker who has helped underwrite legally sensitive documentaries like Michael Moore's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' and Morgan Spurlock's ''Super Size Me,'' says that typically ''even the mere threat of a lawsuit can stop a documentary in its tracks.'' Greenwald is optimistic but guarded. ''I want to make a great film,'' he says. ''But I'd like to do so without losing my house and spending the rest of my life in court.''   visitor to Greenwald's office could be forgiven for thinking that he had stumbled across a dot-com startup. It is a 24-hour-a-day operation, crammed with computers, monitors, cables, digital recorders, DVD-burners and high-bandwidth Internet lines. One morning when I arrived, a group of bleary-eyed filmmakers were finishing up their night's work and putting on a fresh pot of coffee for the day-shift editors, who were just trickling in.   ''Outfoxed'' was made in an unusually collaborative fashion. In January, Greenwald rigged up a dozen DVD recorders and programmed them to record Fox News 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for about six months. After scrutinizing the initial footage, Greenwald and a team of researchers compiled a list of what they saw as Fox's telltale themes and techniques: stories questioning the patriotism of liberals; relentlessly upbeat reports on Iraq; belligerent hosts who scream at noncompliant guests. Greenwald planned for the list's categories eventually to become organizing sections of the film. As he envisioned it, the film clips grouped by theme, together with voice-overs and commentary, would lay bare Fox's tactics, frame by frame.   Once the list of categories was complete, Greenwald asked MoveOn to round up 10 volunteers, each of whom was assigned a particular time slot during the day to monitor Fox, so that the network's news stories or commentaries were under observation virtually 24 hours a day. When a MoveOn volunteer would spot an example of footage that fit one of Greenwald's categories, he would note the date and precise time and send the information in an e-mail message to Greenwald, who had an assistant code it and transfer it to a spreadsheet.   By May, Greenwald had received enough examples to construct a rough outline of the film. He then hired five editors -- politically passionate filmmakers who can command up to $1,000 a day for TV commercials and movie trailers but who accepted $150 a day for the chance to work on the project. In the evenings, two editors would consult Greenwald's spreadsheets and locate the flagged footage in his vast library of Fox News segments. During the day, the three other editors worked simultaneously on separate parts of the movie, stitching together a coherent narrative from the Fox clips as well as interviews that Greenwald conducted with former Fox employees (some of them disguised to protect their identities) and commentators like the former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite and the liberal media critics Mark Crispin Miller and Eric Alterman. At the end of each day, the editors posted their work on a secure Web site for Greenwald's review.   It is not exactly earth-shattering, of course, to learn that Fox is more conservative than other news networks. What ''Outfoxed'' does is detail the specific ways, both onscreen and behind the scenes, in which the network's conservatism shapes its news and opinion programs. The most stinging blow that ''Outfoxed'' delivers to Fox's ''fair and balanced'' claim comes in a segment of the film on the daily memos apparently sent to the entire Fox news operation by John Moody, Fox News's senior vice president for news and editorial. The memos, which Greenwald says were provided by two unnamed employees at the network, set the agenda for how events will be covered. One memo, thought to have been circulated at Fox in April, instructs employees how to report on the increasing number of American fatalities in Iraq: ''Do not fall into the easy trap of mourning the loss of U.S. lives,'' it reads. Another memo outlines the approach to covering the United States military's siege on Falluja: ''It won't be long before some people start to decry the use of 'excessive force,''' it says. ''We won't be among that group.'' A third, on the 9/11 Commission, is equally firm: ''The fact that former Clinton and both former and current Bush administration officials are testifying gives it a certain tension, but this is not 'what did he know and when did he know it' stuff,'' it cautions. ''Do not turn this into Watergate.''   Greenwald is pleased with the finished product. ''I wanted to use Fox's own words and images to show exactly what they do,'' he says. ''Fox is a Republican, not merely a conservative, network.''    The walls and bookshelves of Greenwald's office testify to his longstanding passion for liberal and left-wing causes: a photo of Coretta Scott King; a ''Free Leonard Peltier'' poster; books by Robert McChesney, the left-leaning media critic. Greenwald got hooked on making documentaries in 2000, when two filmmakers, Richard Ray Perez and Joan Sekler, came to him with hundreds of hours of film they had shot during the Florida recount. With his help, they produced ''Unprecedented,'' a 2002 documentary about how the Bush campaign prevailed in that contest.   Last year, Greenwald followed up that effort with ''Uncovered,'' his critique of the Bush administration's case for war in Iraq, which featured interviews with former intelligence analysts, weapons inspectors and Foreign Service officers. Once the film wrapped, Greenwald turned the traditional distribution model on its head. Rather than taking the time-consuming route of entering film festivals or courting theater distributors, he sold the DVD of ''Uncovered'' through the Web sites of various left-liberal organizations: MoveOn, The Nation magazine, the Center for American Progress and the alternative-news Web sites AlterNet and BuzzFlash. After about 23,000 orders in the first two days, the courtyard of the R.G.P. building was filled with stacks of DVD's waiting to be mailed out. When the number of orders hit 100,000, Greenwald enlisted a commercial distributor, which sold an additional 20,000 copies.   The populist MoveOn and the more centrist Center for American Progress collaborated with Greenwald on ''Uncovered.'' Both sensed that film was becoming an important medium for disseminating their anti-Bush, antiwar messages -- different though the organization's politics are -- and both provided financial support and helped spread the word. Podesta says that this kind of multimedia, multiorganization project is an effective way of reaching a younger demographic, which policy groups traditionally have difficulty courting. ''Given the choice between sponsoring a policy book that nobody reads and a documentary that sells 100,000 copies and is seen all over the country,'' he says, ''I'll opt for the latter.'' In the first half of what Greenwald calls his ''upstairs-downstairs'' distribution model, Podesta saw to it that every member of the United States Senate and House of Representatives was invited to a screening of ''Uncovered''; the Center for American Progress also sponsored additional screenings at other elite institutions in Washington and Cambridge, Mass.   Meanwhile, ''downstairs,'' MoveOn alerted its 2.2 million members to the film and sponsored about 2,600 ''house parties'' on the night that ''Uncovered'' was released. From Anchorage to Boston, people plugged their ZIP code into MoveOn's Web site, located the nearest party and watched and discussed the film with a few dozen of their fellow citizens.   Lawrence Konner, a screenwriter and producer whose production company, the Documentary Campaign, made ''Persons of Interest,'' a film about Muslim detainees in the United States, says that ''Uncovered'' ''demonstrated to the rest of us that there was a new way of marketing a documentary.'' The film's grass-roots success attracted a distributor, Cinema Libre, which took it to Cannes and sold it all over the world. A new version with additional material is scheduled for theatrical release in the United States on Aug. 13.   Greenwald's office is now a veritable progressive-documentary incubator: future projects include a brief film for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and ''Unconstitutional,'' a movie about post-9/11 civil liberties violations that is supported by the A.C.L.U. Some in the entertainment industry argue that the collaboration between Greenwald and his political partners promises a new paradigm -- one in which Hollywood entertainers contribute their skills to a political cause rather than just their cash and left-leaning pieties. ''It used to be that the only time political people came to Hollywood was to go to parties and raise money,'' says Julie Bergman Sender, who has produced films like ''G.I. Jane'' and made short issue-advocacy films for political groups like America Coming Together, the grass-roots organization backed by George Soros. ''But now we're showing them that we can do more than write checks.''   Jim Gilliam, a 26-year-old former dot-com executive and a producer of ''Outfoxed,'' is enthusiastic about the way Greenwald's projects meld grass-roots politics with the culture of the Internet. He predicts a future -- augured by events like MoveOn's competition for the best 30-second anti-Bush advertisement -- in which young political filmmakers will be as likely to wield a camera phone as a digital camera. ''It won't be long before people will be shooting and editing short documentaries that they'll stream from their blogs,'' he says. If the Internet, as media critics like Jon Katz have suggested, has resuscitated the fiery journalistic spirit of Thomas Paine, guerrilla documentaries offer to put that polemical attitude in the director's chair.   Two weeks before production for ''Outfoxed'' had to lock so that it would be ready for its July 13 premiere, the atmosphere at the meeting in Greenwald's office was somewhat giddy, the staff burned out from late nights and seven-day workweeks. Greenwald lightened the mood by passing out ''Faux News Channel'' T-shirts (''We Distort, You Comply'') that were sent to him by someone who wants to distribute ''Outfoxed.'' Good news came over the speakerphone from a woman clearing rights for the movie: Eric Clapton had granted permission to use ''Layla'' at no charge -- his generosity said to be inspired by his dislike of Rupert Murdoch. (Don Henley, no stranger to liberal causes, has granted permission for ''Dirty Laundry'' to accompany a sequence in the film on the birth of Fox News.)   ''O.K., we have only 16 days, so what's left?'' Greenwald asked. It turned out to be a lot. Sound editing, color correction, mixing. Video was still being downloaded as the editors looked for material to fill narrative gaps in the film; many segments were still in rough shape. Then there was the fact that several major news organizations were unexpectedly refusing to license their clips. (Such licensing is ordinarily pro forma.) CBS wouldn't sell Greenwald the clip of Richard Clarke's appearance on ''60 Minutes,'' explaining that it didn't want to be associated with a controversial documentary about Murdoch. WGBH, the Boston PBS station, wouldn't let Greenwald use excerpts from ''Frontline'' for fear of looking too ''political,'' it said.   Greenwald argues that this represents precisely the kind of corporate control of public information that he and his legal team want to challenge by strengthening the right to fair use -- the legal principle that allows you to use copyrighted material without permission for purposes of commentary, criticism or parody. Despite the principle's self-evident logic -- consider the impossible position of a critic forbidden to quote from the book he is reviewing -- it is murky in practice, and nowhere more so than in film. Part of the problem is that while a fair-use claim might stand a good chance of prevailing in court, as a practical matter the high costs of litigation force most filmmakers to simply remove the material in question.   The legal strategy for ''Outfoxed'' was still being devised by Greenwald's legal team, which includes the Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig and Chris Sprigman, a fellow at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society. Lessig and Sprigman were deciding whether it would be most advantageous to go through the motions of asking Fox for permission (which it would very likely refuse), to release the film and wait to see whether Fox would sue or to ask a judge to rule on their claims right away by issuing a so-called declaratory judgment.   Glancing around the office, Greenwald took in the news of the various permission setbacks and other loose ends with a weary look. He made it clear to the staff that they would all be working on Memorial Day, and every day after that until June 21, when the film locked. ''Let's just go out there and make the perfect movie,'' he said as he sent the team back to their editing docks, ''and we'll figure out what we'll actually be able to use later on.''      Robert S.

      Cartography of Excess Bureau d'études, Multiplicity Brian Holmes  Utopian ideas - like "Spaceship Earth" - are round, multidimensional, interrelated: their archetypal map is the Milky Way, the infinite constellations. But rational thinking is instrumental, linear, it distorts: and that's exactly the problem with the Mercator map, the most common world projection. Buckminster Fuller, inventor of the geodesic dome, created a "Dymaxion map" to undo those distortions. First the earth becomes a geometric figure, an isocahedron: its 20 triangles are then disjointed and laid flat, so the land masses radiate from a nexus in the north, without splitting continents or enlarging the polar regions. Fuller based his politics on this map: at the '67 World Expo in Montreal, in the dome of the U.S. pavilion, he wanted to lay out a vast Dymaxion projection, and animate it with the most up-to-date statistics, so visitors could watch the flow of resources across the earth - and identify the patterns, the inequalities, the most wasteful and efficient solutions. Delegations from different regions would meet for cooperative sessions, in a problem-solving process called the "World Peace Game."1 The idea was simple: radical democracy. "Make the world work, for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone."2 	Gerardus Mercator was a Protestant scholar from Flanders; he published his map in 1569, to help European merchants plot routes to distant shores. The ability to sail in straight lines led to a capitalist world-economy. Oyvind Fahlström was a Swedish artist who spent his childhood in Brazil, and died in the U.S.A. His World Map was painted in 1972, not long after Fuller imagined his utopia. Fahlström's map recalls the Mercator projection: but the oceans have practically disappeared, the continents are crushed or swollen by the political pressures that the world-economy brings. Space overflows with clashes between the wealthy and the downtrodden, the CIA and the freedom-fighters, the capitalists, the communists, the revolutionaries. Fahlström was interested in resistance and excess: by which I mean politics plus overflowing subjectivity, figurative invention. For him, a map was a flat, rule-governed space for a strict social game; but it also was an open territory for imaginary play.3 In the early seventies he created a series of Monopoly sets (CIA Monopoly, World Trade Monopoly, Indochina, etc.), where political and economic information provides inflexible rules, whatever our passion, whatever our creativity. Yet a work like his Pentagon Puzzle - including a detail of a square earth, wrapped in chains - could also be taken apart, dispersed, its pieces reinserted into another game. 	Fuller's utopia was not accepted for the U.S. pavilion in 1967: at the entryway, officials placed a huge golden eagle. But today, Internet access has brought tremendous information within our reach. Now everyone can play at mapping resources. "The communications aspect of my work can be vastly augmented by the use of computers and by the use of television, video and the miniaturizing trend of cassettes of video communication…. millions of people and multi-billions of dollars are at work in developing just such equipment, personnel and know-how," wrote Fuller in 1970.4 Part of Bucky's heritage is "osEarth Inc.," a think-tank and data-base compiler which organizes World Game sessions on a huge Dymaxion map, as a learning experience for youth. However, that experience is also sold to negotiating teams from Fortune 500 corporations. "Global civil society," with all its complicities, is squarely on the map in 2002. Does anyone doubt that Fahlström's Monopoly paintings, with their focus on political confrontation, come much closer to the games the world really plays? Yet the recent round of counter-summits and global demonstrations still recall Fuller's basic idea, radical democracy. And one begins to wonder: where are the artist-cartographers of today?  Power Lines The Paris-based conceptual group, Bureau d'études, works intensively in two dimensions. For a recent exhibition called "Planet of the Apes" they have created integrated wall charts of the ownership ties between transnational organizations, a synoptic view of the world monetary game. Against a black ground, shield-like forms are emblazoned with the names of states, regulatory bodies, think tanks, financial firms and corporations. Texts on privatization and flexibilization are posted among the circuit-like arrays. A few spots give way to blue zones, humorous and surreal, like word-balloons or psychic oceans: these hold counter-information from autonomous groups, manifestos, constitutions, calls to action... Instead of a catalogue, the visitor gets three "Wartime Chronicles," single sheets that divide the power players into overlapping regions. One is a finance pole, with pension funds, portfolio managers and banks, plus gray zones of legitimating foundations. Another shows telcoms, media groups, networks of consumer distribution. So you want to call the police on these criminals? Military institutions, intelligence agencies, weapon makers and satellite companies complete the picture. A few quotes run along the sides of the sheets, like this one from the artist Fabrice Hybert: "My first collector, well, big collector... was a mediator for NATO and the big structures like that, NATO and the African or South American countries, something like that, another one is a mediator for all the arms industries, well, you know, it's horrible but he has this capacity to abstract himself in that scene... Me, I like people like that."5 If artists are talking in those terms, where can you escape? There's a wager in this exhibition: paint a totalitarian picture, crystal clear, and people will look for the cracks into some other dimension. Another giveaway, the eight-page text called "Potentials," explores "autonomous knowledge/power" - i.e. the deconstruction and unconventional reconstruction of complex machines - with a political analysis of different anarchist positions, as well as maps or figures listing dissident knowledge producers, squats and hacklabs, and a chart that relates various forms of non-capitalist exchange. A non-price (0 euros) and a contractual note figures on each of the sheets: "The present publication cannot be acquired, sold or destroyed. All persons may nonetheless use it as long as they please, with an obligation to give it to others if no longer desired." This last detail has its importance: as Bruce Sterling recently put it: "Information Wants To Be Worthless" - worthless in monetary terms, that is.6 And far beyond the computer logic of Open Source, the great alternative project of the last decade has been mapping the transnational space invested primarily by the corporations, and distributing that knowledge for free. This is the real power of "spontaneous cooperation," in a global information project like Indymedia. Across a decade and more, from the early '80s to the mid-90s, the rules of the neoliberal economy were hidden in the back holes of offshore operations. Today, a multitude of projects like "Planet of the Apes" are making them increasingly visible.7 To the point where a new resistance means that we can start imagining - or exploring - a radically different map of the planet again. Fuller would have loved the design of the Internet, which makes information-sharing possible for the World Game. Fahlström, the admirer of cartoonist Robert Crumb, would have loved the crowd at the Days of Global Action: autonomous and wild, intelligent and quick on their feet. Bureau d'études is in that crowd: by collaborating with squats, jobless people and sans papiers, by operating a self-organizing space in Strasbourg, the "Syndicat Potentiel," and combining it with "Université Tangente," a project for autonomous knowledge production, they have begun quietly broadcasting a pragmatic intransigence to the younger artists on a French art scene, dominated by the likes of Fabrice Hybert. A new level of engagement is marked by their meeting with the No-Border Network for the Strasbourg camp in summer of 2002, an attempt to subvert one of the strongest power-lines: the Schengen Information System. Activities like those simply can't appear on the walls of the art world. In this sense, half the work of Bureau d'études remains underground: the refusals and denunciations are clear, the cooperation and subjective play remains almost invisible. And maybe it's better that way: how could you successfully represent an alternative, radically democratic experience?  Uncertain Uses A sophisticated mapping project has tried to answer just that question. The screen before you shows a purple-black mass, spangled with mesmerizing constellations: slowly you realize it's a night-photo of urbanized Europe, with white rectangles marking zones of potential activity. The scene breaks: music plays, letters dance and roll, spelling out words; and you begin to wander within a matrix of slightly elevated, freestanding screens. You find yourself surrounded by distinct sets of imposing, static black-and-white images of architectural arrays; then snapshot color pics of people mingling freely in a everyday scenes; then sustained interviews in black-and-white with huge talking heads; then lyrical video strolls through some personal warp in the urban terrain. Stop in front of one screen, and a specific, localized story unfolds: architectural setting, actors, individual story, subjective path through the city. Until the scene breaks, the language rolls, the music plays, and the permutations begin differently again. On the fringes of the art world, a group of urbanists has created one of the most impressive systems of visual representation to appear in recent years: USE, or the "Uncertain States of Europe," a project by Stefano Boeri and Multiplicity. 	Multiplicity is a networked research team, exploring the European territory as it changes, in twenty-six different sites from Athens to Espoo, from Porto to Bucharest or Moscow. The basic premise is that borders are ungraspable, that architectural programs and urban limits are unstable - but everywhere, the subjective excess of "autopoetic innovations" creates recognizable patterns of change, at least for the observer who mingles with them. For Boeri, whose aim is to deconstruct an outdated urban planner's gaze, what we are seeing is "the triumph of the multitude": consistently mutating but thoroughly unpredictable patterns of self-organization, niching in built environments that have increasingly lost their predetermined function. Thus one of the sequences (keyword: détournement) recounts how the uses of the Chinese community have completely transformed the ideal program of a huge modern housing slab in the 13th district of Paris. Another (keyword: eruption) deals with the careful organization of chaotic raves, "nomadic flames": "The paths of the millions of ravers and tribes that invade Europe's streets every weekend bring us ever further away from a precise, functional destination."8 	The reference to the multitude in Boeri's text, and indeed, on the screens of USE, recalls the political thinking of Italian Autonomia, with their central theme of "exodus," or conscious withdrawal from modernist planning and salaried labor. Obviously it's a dilemma for the traditional urbanist, or for any politician wanting to exercise control: "Escaping this condition of powerlessness simply implies accepting the ungovernability of a great deal of the contemporary territory," writes Boeri. This in its turn would mean "learning to act in a context directed by different, highly variable subjects."9 Or in what I'd call a situation of radical democracy. 	But the big question that remains is how to use an installation like USE, and how to use the operational model of a networked, collaborative research group like Multiplicity. The exhibition device itself, elaborated outside the typical gallery-museum circuit, is the best installation I've yet seen on interactive social process: with its extensive matrix of screens, it opens up a real-and-imaginary territory, a multidimensional, interrelated world of subjective freedoms. But to what extent is it effectively political? "To resist is not to be against, any more, but to singularize," writes Suely Rolnik, reflecting on the changing meanings of artistic practice since the Great Refusal of the 1960s. "All and any acts of resistance are acts of creation and not acts of negation."10 	Beautifully said - but I'm not certain. The great theoretical swing of the past three decades, from critical negation to use value and subversive affirmation, has left "progressive" practices wide open to every complicity. Despite the autopoetic processes that an installation like USE so brilliantly lets us see, the entire planet - Spaceship Earth - is prey to a resurgence of repressive authority, within the perfectly legible game of the capitalist world-economy. Berlusconi's Italy, where the project has been shown, is hardly an exception: and yet it is also one of the laboratories for new forms of political mobilization. Can we imagine artistic representations of self-organizing processes, in open confrontation with the economic game? "Rules oppose and derail subjectivity, loosen the imprinted circuits of the individual," wrote Oyvind Fahlström. Only then does a deeper territory emerge, a more complex interplay. Power lines/radical democracy.

      (Published in the catalogue of the exhibition "Geography and the Politics of Mobility" at the Generali Foundation in Vienna, 17/1/03–24/4/03. Circulated in advance on the mailing list nettime, 4/12/02.)   Maps for the Outside: “Conceptualism” in the Work of Bureau d'études   The closure of the gallery space is a classic conceptual gesture. Witness this proposal by Robert Barry: "My exhibition at the Art & Project Gallery in Amsterdam in December, '69, will last two weeks. I asked them to lock the door and nail my announcement to it, reading: 'For the exhibition the gallery will be closed.'"1 Conceptual art can be defined, not simply as the refusal of the commodified object and the specialized art system, but as an active signage pointing to the outside world, conceived as an expanded field for experimental practices of intimacy, expression and collaboration – indeed, for the transformation of social reality.2 Thirty-two years later, in October-December 2001, the French group Bureau d'études reiterated the gesture, sealing off the exhibition space of Le Spot, a converted industrial building in the port city of Le Havre. Instead of a simple sign, they confronted the visitor with a book, Juridic Park, which upon closer inspection proved to be a detailed set of maps to the "legal subsoil" of the city. But these maps, like the more recent cartographic projects, do not simply embrace the outside of one of modernity's specialized subsystems. Rather they detail the proliferating closures of a totally administered society, where almost every square inch of terrain is strictly codified for exclusive, proprietary uses. The name of the group, "Bureau d'études," denotes an expert consultancy, a study office for technical research. Theirs is an intensely precise apprehension of the world, shot through with flashes of dark humor. But their work in its broadest dimensions is also the foundation, or perhaps the springboard, for an antagonistic utopia.  Beginnings In 1998, with the exhibition Archives du Capitalisme, Bureau d'études started producing organizational charts showing the proprietary relations between financial funds, government agencies, banks and industrial firms. A number of these graphic charts, or "organigrams,"  were deployed as part of an installation including black-and-white photographs of heads propped up on wooden pickets (presumably CEOs), as well as a scale model of a proposed new parliament building, to articulate the voting rights of those with real power in today's society. The exhibition was an autonomous project in an artist-run space, at the time called the "Faubourg," in the city of Strasbourg. For a subsequent show entitled Le Capital, mounted by Nicolas Bourriaud in the city of Sète, an organigram detailing the relations between the French state and a panoply of major transnational corporations was blown up to wall size. Squares and rectangles of varying proportions, each identified with a name (Société Générale, Dresdner Bank, Mitsubishi, Pirelli, etc.) were connected with a labyrinth of elaborately traced channels, printed in black against a white ground. The result was something like an all-over painting for the computer and finance-obsessed 1990s: an aesthetics of information. In other words, one of the historical failure-points of what has been called "conceptual art." 	Sooner or later, artists working on the analysis and transformation of social reality must face the obvious question: How to escape the formats, publics and modes of exchange that are offered by the gallery-magazine-museum system? The answer is a gradual process, a social and psychic experiment. Invited to a group exhibition for which, as usual, they would not be paid, Bureau d'études responded by creating a "zone de gratuité," Free Land, where treasures and all kinds of junk could be deposited and taken away without the intermediary of money. The experiment of the free zone was pursued in a gallery/living space in Paris, where theoretical curiosity and the more practical prospect of something-for-nothing drew a variegated public. Expanding on the question of the artist's real social status in an age of casual labor and mass intellectuality, Bureau d'études worked with Alejandra Riera, Andreas Fohr and Jorge Alyskewycz to launch the "Syndicat Potentiel" or "Potential Union," a proto-political association addressed to intellectual and cultural producers whose aspirations take them outside all professional categories. The key ideas here came from the French anarchist traditions, but also from theories of the gift economy, developed by the anthropologist Marcel Mauss and reworked by French social critics after the great strikes of 1995, in an era of structural unemployment.3 Among the first co-operators were the group Plus tôt te laat, from Brussels – jobless artists who had occupied an unemployment bureau, transforming it into a center of expression and reflection on the meanings of work in contemporary society. Such reflections in turn led to increasing proximity with the squatters' movements, whether in France, Italy or Germany. From these beginnings, Syndicat Potentiel grew into an open-ended frame for intimate and networked collaborations, with the explicit goal of producing autonomous counter-knowledge, oriented toward an economy of gratuité totale (in which basic services such as living space, water, electricity, access to communications media, etc. would be "totally free").4 The project continues today, giving its name to the self-managed space in Strasbourg where the art group had produced its earliest proposals.  Opportunities It is against the almost invisible background of Syndicat Potentiel and a parallel project, "Université Tangente," that the recent  cartographic projects deserve to be understood. They came as an unexpected, long-desired opportunity. The rupture of consensus brought by the Global Days of Action, beginning in May of 1998, served to galvanize the wider counter-globalization movement, through innovative uses of the Internet as a worldwide distribution system operated from below. A kind of autonomous, do-it-yourself conceptualism began to emerge, whereby "attitudes become forms": an idea or phrase arising in one locality (for instance, "Our Resistance is as Transnational as Capital") becomes a geographically distributed political performance (the "Global Street Parties" against the annual G8 reunions).5 In perfect accord with Lawrence Weiner's famous dictums, the work could be carried out by the initial authors of the ideas, realized by others, or not done at all – something like a taste of planetary exchange, where the "art" is "totally free." 	Even as these protest forces emerged on a large scale – mapping out the power structures of globalization with their feet, as it were – the rise of the information society and the deregulating thrust of neoliberalism had made it possible for relatively small, highly mobile groups to appropriate and use advanced technologies, acting upon extremely sophisticated visions of the world, as the present exhibition shows. Yet these new possibilities for the application of specialized research were not immediately visible in France, due to language barriers, a pitifully conservative art scene, and critical discourses dominated by the aging communist professors of Attac. Perhaps it was as late as December 2001, with massive protests at the EU summit in nearby Brussels, that the potential for a more active distribution of the antagonistic maps became clear. Further institutional projects, at La Box in the city of Bourges, then at Kunst-Werk in Berlin, served as occasions for the initial production of graphic charts in large print runs, for broad distribution. These helped prepare the knowledge and the skill-sets needed for two autonomous, collaborative productions, both printed in thousands of copies for specific activist events: Refuse the Biopolice, for the No Border Camp in Strasbourg in July 2002, and European Norms of World-Production, for the meetings of the European Social Forum in Florence in November of that same year. 	This delayed access to the counter-globalization movements meant that the antagonist maps, with their extraordinary complexity of analysis, have come at the right time – after the initial breakthroughs of the first period of dissent met their enforced pacification and partial neutralization, as a consequence of the violence unleashed by the police riot in Genoa. Both these maps present an excess of information, shattering subjective certainties and demanding reflection, demanding a new gaze on the world that we really live in. These are synoptic visions of the contemporary, transnational version of state capitalism, as constructed "by collusion between specific individuals, transnational corporations, governments, interstate agencies and 'civil society' groups."6 They make visible the institutional patterns that have structured themselves in an overarching, terrifyingly abstract space, almost totally beyond the grasp of the democratic counter-powers formerly exercised within the purview of the national states, and indeed, almost totally invisible – at least until recently when the communicative possibilities have allowed a certain measure of "cognitive mapping" to be performed by inhabitants.7  Refuse the Biopolice, focused on contemporary control systems, also offers more detailed readings of the way that surveillance and incarceration technologies are implemented for profit by private firms, in collaboration with national and interstate agencies. As for the map of European Norms, it specifically charts the vast administrative structure that has arisen around the bureaucratic European Commission, whose directorates, innervated by the demands of corporate lobbies, produce the "industrial standards, territorial models, ideological guidelines and truth criteria" that help structure the production of a life-world – a steel-and concrete form of continental integration, vying with its distorting mirror in North America. European Norms also presents the interlocking structures of so-called "organized civil society," which serves to legitimate the status quo; but at the same time, with the lighter traceries of its mysterious, biomorphic front cover, devoted to "inklings of autonomy," it presents the patterns and meshworks of worldwide potentials for resistance. 	These maps aspire to be cognitive tools, distributing as broadly as possible the kind of specialized information that was formerly confined to technical publications. Yet on another level they are meant to act as subjective shocks, energy potentials, informing the protest-performances as they are passed from hand to hand, deepening the resolve to resist are they are utilized in common or alone. In this sense it is the very closure of their intellectual discipline, the rigor of their conceptual effort to depict a totally administered world, that makes them maps for the outside, signs pointing to a territory that cannot yet be fully signified, and that will never be "represented" in the traditional ways. "Solidarity with extraterrestrials" reads one such indication, in an almost empty bubble at the lower left-hand corner of the cover of European Norms.   Perspectives The acceleration of the last few years has been vertiginous, for everyone. Today, the accumulated knowledge of recent projects and the beginnings of a genuinely networked collaboration make it possible to envision more strategically focused mapping projects. Three recent studies – Info war, Bio war, Psychic war – respond to a need to grasp the fully military strategies of legitimation and population control that have emerged since 1989, with the end of the bipolar stasis predicated on the madness of mutual "overkill."8 Similarly, more limited and precise maps of transnational state capitalism can now be imagined, attuned more closely to the possibilities of the protest and direct-action movements. Another perspective is the possible invention of a computer database, with a visual interface allowing the user to situate specific power-players within a nexus of supporting and opposing relations. Much remains to be done. 	In this light, the old dilemma of the relation to museum, magazine and gallery structures fades toward insignificance. For the tactical media underground in Europe, art shows offer useful research deadlines, a chance to share ideas and critiques, at best some production money – and at worst, a damaging distraction. The revenge of the concept has been to finally create parallel and alternative circuits of experimentation, production, distribution, use and interpretation. To be sure, these circuits are hardly consolidated – but the best way to do so is to maintain other urgencies, which cannot be treated within any of the specialized subsystems. Perhaps one such urgency can be expressed as a question, for artists and activists who must now address increasing levels of confrontation in the world. The question runs like this: Is it still possible to sublimate antagonistic conflicts into the pacifying rituals of reasoned, agonistic debate?9 Or in other words: Can properly political relations be wrested from a totally administered world?

      RG: Leaving the dialogically expressive constructivism you allude to aside at your request ... you just pointed to the necessity of taking more cultural questions on board if there is to be cooperation "across the world space"; yet you also seem to indicate in your "FP" text that one of the failures of Cultural Studies, or at least the branch inherited from the Birmingham School, occurred when the emphasis they placed on reception was detached from the "dynamics of class" ... thereby, giving legitimacy to a new transnational consumer ideology (via an alienation "made one's own") and resulting in an absorption by contemporary capitalism. Outside of the general question of an always impending absorption, is there anything in particular to learn from the experience and fate of British Cultural Studies as it pertains to this detachment "from dynamics of class" as alluded to in "FP"? (…) BH: First of all, I think there would be an awful lot to be learned from an attempt to seriously study and make public the geographical specifics of the new global division of labor. It's difficult, because one would have to take into account not only localities on the macro-scale (countries, regions), but also flows of populations and patterns of resettlement, and all of this without reifying or reducing anything, with a full understanding of the existing divisions of labor and hierarchies of class in societies and localities all around the planet. Formidable task! But not taking it on means not being able to even begin to understand how contemporary capitalism works, and who works for it, when, where, how, under what conditions. Cultural studies pretty much gave up that kind of ambition, after the initial studies which drew on an inherited understanding of English working class conditions. A lot of it was sucked into "studies" of individual or peer-group reception: How I felt when I went dancing last night! And that's what I call the personal twist that is given to the globalized media product.  BH: The Autonomia thinkers, and the social movements that have taken up and multiplied some of those ideas (or maybe actually produced them in the first place) have been extremely strong on affirmation, which they also call "exodus." It means: "Who cares about the old paradigm? We start doing the new thing, what we want, right now." It's obviously a good foot to put forward. To affirm sounds a little flat, but to create is clearly very interesting. What I've observed (and some people close to me agree) is that creation doesn't seem to happen without resistance. Why is that? I think, basically like Marcuse way back when, that our societies are really good at absorbing the affirmative. The best of all possible worlds is an old theme in cultural critique. What's different today is that the semiotic economy and the techniques of co-optation have made it incredibly easy to take any simply affirmative gesture, indeed, any simply "creative" action, and repackage it for the economic and political profit of a directive force. So the negative becomes very appealing. In the Flexible Personality I wanted to be savagely negative. I didn't want to be co-opted in five minutes. I think the negative is vitally important for social movements. You have to constitute the enemy, because in front of you they're always saying "We're your friends (this bazooka is only here for your safety)." But at the same time, the whole thing that we have learned from the movements of the 60s and 70s is that a specular face-off with the enemy will only lead to the reinstatement of the same, even if you supposedly win. So you also have to dissolve the enemy: exodus. It's a paradox, but I believe it's a real one. What's more, I think there's still quite a great need to talk and write about that particular paradox, because in the first flush of realization that the specular confrontation is a dead end, and that exodus exists, that jouissance exists, people tend to think that's it, we've discovered the solution and in fact people are already practicing it all over. OK, great, so much the better. But I have an increasingly hard time believing that we're living in the best of all possible worlds.

      Bleyer: You mentioned hot websites. I'm curious about your thoughts on the web now, because ten years ago you seemed optimistic about its potential.  Wilson: Well, I wouldn't say I was an optimist. I was curious and attempted an anti-pessimist view. I went to about 25 conferences in Europe in seven years, and in all that time, I never had a computer or was on the Internet myself. I never have been. So I went to these conferences as the voice of caution, the one guy who doesn't own a computer. Little by little, my talks at these conferences would become more and more Luddite, sounding the knell of warning about mechanization of consciousness and alienation and separation. There was a time when everything was so confused and chaotic that it was easy to believe that this technology would be an exception to all the other technologies, and instead of enslaving us, it would liberate us. I never actually believed that, but I was willing to talk to people who did. Now I'm not willing to talk to them anymore. I have no interest in this dialogue. It's finished. The Internet revealed itself as the perfect mirror image of global capital. It has no borders? Neither does global capital. Governments can't control it? Neither can they control global capital. Nor do they want to. They've given up trying, and now they basically serve as the mercenary armed forces for the corporate interstate--the 200 or 300 megacorporations that actually run the world. Fine. But let's not call this radical politics, and let's not call this liberation, and let's not talk about cyberfeminism or virtual community. Basically, I'm a Luddite. Certain technologies hurt the commonality, as they used to say in the early 19th century. Any machinery that was hurtful to the commonality, they took their sledgehammers out and tried to smash. Direct action. That's the Luddite critique--you do it with a sledgehammer. What it means now to live as a Luddite seems to me to involve a strict attention to what technologies one allows into one's life. (…)  Bleyer: But isn't there something to be said for the subversive use of technologies?  Wilson: We believed that in the '80s. The idea was that alternative media would allow us the space in which to organize other things. Even in the '80s I said I'm waiting for my turkey and my turnips. I want some material benefits from the Internet. I want to see somebody set up a barter network where I could trade poetry for turnips. Or not even poetry--lawn cutting, whatever. I want to see the Internet used to spread the Ithaca dollar system around America so that every community could start using alternative labor dollars. It is not happening. And so I wonder, why isn't it happening? And finally the Luddite philosophy becomes clear. We create the machines and therefore we think we control them, but then the machines create us, so we can create new machines, which then can create us. It's a feedback situation between humanity and technology. There is some truth to the idea of technological determination, especially when you're unconscious, drifting around like a sleepwalker. Especially when you've given up believing in anti-capitalism because they've convinced you that the free market is a natural law, and we just have to accept that and hope for a free market with a friendly smiling face. Smiley-faced fascism. I see so many people working for that as if it were a real cause. "If we have to have capitalism, let's make it green capitalism." There's no such thing. It's a hallucination of the worst sort, because it isn't even a pleasurable one. It's a nightmare. (…) Now, about art in the service of the revolution: There is no art in the service of the revolution, because if there's no revolution, there's no art in its service. So to say that you're an artist but you're progressive is a schizo position. We have only capital, so all art is either in its service or it fails. Those are the two alternatives. If it's successful, it's in the service of capital. I don't care what the content is. The content could be Malcolm X crucified on a bed of lettuce. It doesn't matter.  Bleyer: But what about the growing protest movement of the past five years, which really does seem significant?  Wilson: You mean people who are building puppets and going around the world being radical tourists?  Bleyer: The perhaps one million people coming to the streets of New York to protest the RNC in August, for example.  Wilson: Well, make it two million. It can be like the biggest anti-war marches ever held, they were forgotten five minutes later. All they're doing is assuaging their conscience a little. At best, it's symbolic discourse and it never goes beyond that. Especially in North America. It's not going to save the world to dump Bush and these people are deluded.  Bleyer: What do you think about Burning Man and other events that are in essence Temporary Autonomous Zones (TAZ) but don't necessarily dismantle the power structures of global capital?  Wilson: I've never been to Burning Man, but that's just accidental, because I’ve given up travel. As far as I can tell it's a lovely thing. I call those things "periodic autonomous zones." The thing about the TAZ is I didn't invent it, I just gave it a name. I think it's a sociological reality that groups of people will come together to maximize some concept of freedom that they share as naturally as breathing. When all the potential for the emergence for a TAZ is maximized, either because you've helped to maximize it or because your local situation has arrived at a certain point where it becomes possible, you'll do it. Like I've said before, a TAZ is anywhere from two to several thousand people, who for as little as two or three hours or for as much as a couple of years manage to keep that mood going. And it's incredibly vital. It's vital that every human being should have some such experience, or else they'll never know that another world is possible. So Burning Man is a kind of periodic autonomous zone. As soon as the first hint of commercialization or tiredness appears, then I would think the best thing to do is to close it down. Move on, reappear somewhere else. And ultimately, I do believe that another world is possible and that permanent changes could be made. But that's different. That's a revolution.  Wilson's books are available from Autonomedia. His next book of essays, Lost Histories, will be out this fall.  Jennifer Bleyer is a journalist and activist who lives in Fort Greene.

         From: lkl      This article might be old news to some of you    but for the ones who have not read it, it makes for an interesting    read. While the United States and the rest of the Global market place    discuss RFID chips as solely as an item for consumer goods, the    Mexican government simply implemented RFID chips to their most    efficient potential, the security and access of individuals, by    embedding RFID chips into government officials and workers. The recent    unofficial leak of official US documents in Mexico might make this    unprecedented step a 'logically' proper one but I am sure it also    makes some Sam Walton executives turn green. Finally, the technology    is a simple upgrade to a chip developed by a livestock tracking    company with the moniker straight out of a modern Hollywood Sci-Fi    Revelations update, DigitalArial Angel Corp.    http://www.digitalangel.net/    http://www.salon.com/tech/wire/2004/07/14/chip/    Salon.com      Chip implanted in Mexico security workers     By Will Weissert July 14, 2004  |  MEXICO CITY    Security has reached the subcutaneous level for Mexico's    attorney general and at least 160 people in his office -- they have    been implanted with microchips that get them access to secure areas of    their headquarters. It's a pioneering application of a technology that    is widely used in animals but not in humans. Mexico's top federal    prosecutors and investigators began receiving chip implants in their    arms in November in order to get access to restricted areas inside the    attorney general's headquarters, said Antonio Aceves, general director    of Solusat, the company that distributes the microchips in Mexico.    Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha and 160 of his employees    were implanted at a cost to taxpayers of $150 for each rice    grain-sized chip. More are scheduled to get tagged" in coming months,    and key members of the Mexican military, the police and the office of    President Vicente Fox might follow suit, Aceves said. Fox's office did    not immediately return a call seeking comment. A spokeswoman for    Macedo de la Concha's office said she could not comment on Aceves'    statements, citing security concerns. But Macedo himself mentioned the    chip program to reporters Monday, saying he had received an implant in    his arm. He said the chips were required to enter a new federal    anti-crime information center. It's only for access, for security," he    said. The chips also could provide more certainty about who accessed    sensitive data at any given time. In the past, the biggest security    problem for Mexican law enforcement has been corruption by officials    themselves. Aceves said his company eventually hopes to provide    Mexican officials with implantable devices that can track their    physical location at any given time, but that technology is still    under development. The chips that have been implanted are manufactured    by VeriChip Corp., a subsidiary of Applied Digital Solutions Inc. of    Palm Beach, Fla. They lie dormant under the skin until read by an    electromagnetic scanner, which uses a technology known as radio    frequency identification, or RFID, that's now getting hot in the    inventory and supply chain businesses. Scott Silverman, Applied    Digital Solutions' chief executive, said each of his company's    implantable chips has a special identification number that would foil    an impostor. The technology is out there to duplicate (a chip)," he    said. What can't be stolen is the unique identification number and the    information that is tied to that number." Erik Michielsen, director of    RFID analysis at ABI Research Inc., said that in theory the chips    could be as secure as existing RFID-based access control systems such    as the contactless employee badges widely used in corporate and    government facilities. However, while those systems often employ    encryption, Applied Digital's implantable chips do not as yet.    Silverman said his company's system is nevertheless save because its    chips can only be read by the company's proprietary scanners. In    addition to the chips sold to the Mexican government, more than 1,000    Mexicans have implanted them for medical reasons, Aceves said.    Hospital officials can use a scanning device to download a chip's    serial number, which they then use to access a patient's blood type,    name and other information on a computer. The Food and Drug    Administration has yet to approve microchips as medical devices in the    United States. Still, Silverman said that his company has sold 7,000    chips to distributors worldwide and that more than 1,000 of those had    likely been inserted into customers, mostly for security or    identification reasons. In 2002, a Florida couple and their teenage    son had Applied Digital Solutions chips implanted in their arms. The    family hoped to someday be able to automatically relay their medical    information to emergency room staffers. The chip originally was    developed to track livestock and wildlife and to let pet owners    identify runaway animals. The technology was created by Digital Angel    Corp., which was acquired by Applied Digital Solutions in 1999.    Because the Applied Digital chips cannot be easily removed -- and are    housed in glass capsules designed to break and be unusable if taken    out -- they could be even more popular someday if they eventually can    incorporate locator capabilities. Already, global positioning system    chips have become common accouterments on jewelry or clothing in    Mexico. In fact, in March, Mexican authorities broke up a ring of    used-car salesmen turned kidnappers who were known as Los Chips"    because they searched their victims to detect whether they were    carrying the chips to help them be located.
