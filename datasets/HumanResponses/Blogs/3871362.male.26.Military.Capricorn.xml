      The USO (United Service Organizations - same people that brought Bob Hope and Marilyn to the troops in past wars) have a small mobilehome here in Bahrain. Inside they sell food and garbage - cookies, gum, chocolate, soda - and then brass arabish trinkets, hookahs, and cheap sunglasses. They also sell T-shirts that boast of our recent victory in Iraq. I bought two.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   The first one:  OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM  THE BAGHDAD AIR SHOW  SADDAM - HOW DO YOU LIKE OUR THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT NOW?  Below these words: a map of Iraq, mostly concealed by a mushroom cloud, and surrounded by two aircraft carriers, an F-15, a Cobra helicopter, and an A-10, swooping towards the viewer.  &nbsp;   The second one:  OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM  Below this is, unlike the first shirt, a map of the whole region - a geography so distorted and deformed as to be identifiable only by the labels: Iraq, Jordan, Iran, etc (Turkey is left out). No mushroom cloud on this one - but the artist placed crosshairs on Baghdad, and then included a similar&nbsp;collection of attacking elements: an F-16, an Apache helo, a tank, a carrier (in the body of water labeled 'Gulf'), and an F-111 (an aircraft no longer used by the US).  Then, finally, at the bottom:  WE WERE THERE  &nbsp;   I felt bad for the Bahrainis - likely Shia - whom the USO has employed to sell these items, although this didn't stop me.

      Yesterday morning I went for a run. As per usual it was well over 100F, so I took my shirt off. Also as per usual I chose to run laps around a warehouse, so I put on headphones to defeat boredom.   Half a lap later, and only a minute into 'Surfing USA', a black van came to an angled halt in front of me - as if the driver suspected I had escape in mind. This driver, Ensign Something, from Base Security, curtly informed me, as if for the tenth time, that it was against base policy to run without a shirt, and to run while listening to music.&nbsp; Then, abruptly and somewhat unsafely, he squealed off.  So I moped back to grab my shirt, remove my headphones, and continue. This lasted for 4 laps; I was hot and bored.   The headphone ban I can understand; lots of forklifts and trucks around.   But why is it that - next to a warehouse located in the armpit of the world - I can't run without a shirt? Who exactly might I offend?   I'll run again today. Defiance toward unnecessary regulations.

      On Thursday I went on another mission into Iraq.&nbsp; Aside from the ridge of smoke drifting from a burning oil pipeline, you would never guess there was a significant counter-insurgency underway.&nbsp; I had also been issued a parachute and pistol – those, too, contributed to my awareness of the violence below.&nbsp; None of this prevented me from falling asleep several times.   Yesterday: Champagne brunch on the top floor of the Diplomat hotel in Bahrain.&nbsp; A guy from my squadron pointed out that - slunked down in our chairs, seeing only blue sky outside the windows, and hearing only the clink of plates, fragments of other people’s conversations, and the Filipino karaoke band ('I've got friends in low places')&nbsp;– it seemed like we were on a cruise ship.&nbsp; The sensation was ruined, however, once I looked out the window at the dhows in the port, and the slummy grey/brown neighborhoods that surround the hotel on three sides – neighborhoods potentially filled (by the suspicious American military mind) with disaffected, angry, riotous mobs.&nbsp; I became worried, momentarily, by the thought of RPG fire from a nearby highrise, and realized I felt safer in the aircraft over Iraq.&nbsp; At least there I had a warm gun.&nbsp; Here at brunch I had only beef Wellington to shield myself from shrapnel.

      Yesterday morning, I looked across the aisle of the aircraft, and watched as the kid across from me puked into a white paper bag.  Then we jammed onto the deck of the carrier, caught the arresting cable, and the bag of puke scrunched in the kid's chest, somehow unruptured.  We halted, taxied, parked, and - surrounded by the blue water of the Gulf - I walked across the 120F flight deck and down into the ship.  Aside from the sweltering heat, and my drenched flightsuit, it was a good ride.  Still dripping I dropped into an admiral's brief; later, and less wet, I had lunch in the flag mess (dining room) (chimichongas).  Nearly dry, climbed up to the bridge to watch F-14s, F-18s, and Prowlers launch into some mission.  And finally, completely dry, I was handed a wet helmet, a wet lifevest, and was soon catapulted of the deck, and back to Bahrain.

      I wonder if someone who wears pink ties - with the frequency that John Kerry seems to - can become president.  May not win over the gunshow crowd, despite his proficiency with weapons.

      FAILURE AND PHILOSOPHY  There is, according to some philosophers, a phrase that casts a debilitating shadow across mankind’s ability to gain access to basic scientific truths:  the theory-laden observation.  We assume there is a discernable reality to be uncovered through the application of the scientific method; unfortunately, the impartiality of our scientists is routinely infected by preconceptions:  old theories and new hypotheses.  These unfairly – and often covertly – color our efforts at collection, analysis, and the eventual drawing of conclusions.  The result is an inaccurate depiction of reality.  This notion of theory-laden observations is really common sense:  we often see what we wish to see.  This phenomenon has recently been demonstrated – not by philosophers and scientists – but by another truth–seeking body: our intelligence community. And the forum was not some unread niche journal – but television, in front of Congress, where we witnessed our chief justification for invading Iraq fall apart: where “weapons of mass destruction” were meekly reduced to “program related activities.”  For followers of the philosopher Karl Popper, the inspiration for a theory does not matter so much as how we test the deductive consequences:  to avoid a biased outcome, we should make a concerted effort to use observation-statements to falsify rather than confirm our theories.  With regard to the leading theory of the day - that Iraq possessed stockpiles of WMD - the inspiration may have been:  1.Administration officials digging for an excuse to go to war; 2.Historical assumptions based on Hussein’s past transgressions involving WMD; 3.Rumors that emerged and were propagated according to some sociological group-think law that governs rumors; 4.Stories presented to debriefing officers by ingratiating defectors and disaffected exiles.  It may have been a combination of the above, or none at all.  That is still to be determined, and may remain forever unclear.  But again: when the time came to examine the evidence – to compare actual observations with deductive consequences - it was that test, rather than the source of the theory, that should have occupied the forefront of our thoughts.   As March of 2003 approached, the intelligence community focused on the task of searching for Iraqi WMD with greater and greater intensity – and in the end allowed a theory and its varied proponents to dominate analysis.  ·When an interpreter of satellite imagery noticed an unusual traffic pattern develop around an empty warehouse, it would become: ‘possibly WMD-related traffic activity.’  When he saw trailers being moved (as is the fate of trailers) inexplicably around Baghdad, they became: ‘possibly WMD-related mobile laboratories.’  ·If a specialist in signals intelligence were ever to hear a grainy communications intercept concerning a large transfer of dinar, it could become: ‘possibly WMD-related fund-transfer activity.’ When the chatter referenced a few aluminum tubes, they became: ‘possibly WMD-related aluminum tubes.’  In a pristine world devoid of pre-existing theories, any incomplete set of data would allow for innumerable theories that could adequately explain the observed phenomena (for aficionados: by means of the under-determination of theory by data).  One particular theory is not even guaranteed to be compatible with the next.  We could, for example – strictly using our technically-derived data – have concluded that the Iraqis were developing a secret space program, or a secret jungle-gym project – if were pre-disposed to do so.  That may be a stretch.  But with our preconceptions about WMD, our observations were already laden with a very grave theory indeed, and we were steered, from the beginning, away from a variety of conclusions toward a certain dark one – and yet this conclusion, generously sprinkled with the word ‘possibly’, was just one logically correct theory among many.  Our policy-makers – in Congress, on committees, in offices of special plans, in administrations – are not philosophers.  They saw, presented before them, a stack of evidence, collected by the world’s most expensive and sophisticated surveillance equipment.  Perhaps one document by itself, caveated with the word ‘possibly’, did not look so grand.  But thousands of them?  When combined together to form a self-confirming edifice, labels of uncertainty were marginalized, and the documents and photos came to hold a damning and deadly significance.
