      Infallible as you are to Einstein I cannot help but regard you With such wariness.   Understandably so... You, which I cannot see, smell, and touch Only feel.  The sun seizing Moments of life Dancing rapidly.  The shapeless moon  Tiptoes in the dark Leaving shadows.  Raindrops wooing Leaves golden yet shy Snow on a postcard.  Fallen friendships  Ceased breathing  Withered youth.  Love forgotten Unrequited Gone.  Love resurrected Untamed Still.  Past…  Present…  Future… You, without hands Bare of emotions.  Are you an ally? An adversary? Or just here to stay?

      One day a young man was standing in the middle  of the town proclaiming that he had the most  beautiful heart in the whole valley.    A large crowd gathered and they all admired his  heart for it was perfect. There was not a mark  or a flaw in it. Yes, they all agreed it truly  was the most beautiful heart they had ever seen.    The young man was very proud and boasted more  loudly about his beautiful heart.    Suddenly, an old man appeared at the front of  the crowd and said "Why your heart is not nearly  as beautiful as mine."    The crowd and the young man looked at the old  man's heart. It was beating strongly, but  full of scars, it had places where pieces had  been removed and other pieces put in, but they  didn't fit quite right and there were several  jagged edges. In fact, in some places there were  deep gouges where whole pieces were missing.    The people stared - how can he say his heart is  more beautiful, they thought? The young man  looked at the old man's heart and saw its  state and laughed. "You must be joking," he  said. "Compare your heart with mine, mine is  perfect and yours is a mess of scars and tears."    "Yes," said the old man, "Yours is perfect  looking but I would never trade with you. You  see, every scar represents a person to whom I  have given my love - I tear out a piece of my  heart and give it to them, and often they give  me a piece of their heart which fits into  the empty place in my heart, but because the  pieces aren't exact, I have some rough edges,  which I cherish, because they remind me of the  love we shared. Sometimes I have given pieces of  my heart away, and the other person hasn't  returned a piece of his heart to me. These  are the empty gouges -- giving love is taking a  chance.    Although these gouges are painful, they stay  open, reminding me of the love I have for these  people too, and I hope someday they may  return and fill the space I have waiting. So now  do you see what true beauty is?"    The young man stood silently with tears running  down his cheeks. He walked up to the old man,  reached into his perfect young and beautiful  heart, and ripped a piece out. He offered it to  the old man with trembling hands. The old man  took his offering, placed it in his heart and  then took a piece from his old scarred heart and  placed it in the wound in the young man's heart.  It fit, but not perfectly, as there were some  jagged edges. The young man looked at his heart,  not perfect anymore but more beautiful than  ever, since love from the old man's heart flowed  into his. They embraced and walked away side by  side.    How sad it must be to go through life with a  whole untouched heart.

      Did I say platonic? I cannot recall What matters most is the present, not was said before  I was seized by your wit and entangled in your charm Calmed by your words taintless of harm  Your prized presence, attention and thought Like the others from you, I have fervently sought  I thought it was fleeting, your addictive hold on me Waiting for it to pass thinking I’ll be free  I realized that time was not truly potent I have to break my way out from your enchantment  My reason as my sword and my will as my shield I have broken your spell, my quest fulfilled  The final blow that brought my struggles to an end Was the fear of losing you as a dear friend  Did I say platonic? Now I recall What matters most is the present and what will be from now on

      Malamig na hangin kumot sa katawan nitong mandirigma, sahig ang kanlungan.  Nakapikit ang mga mata mga labing nagpipigil ng marahang pagsambit ng libong panalangin.  Pilitin mang matulog diwa ay kusang gigising lilisanin ang panaginip may himig ng uyayi.  Malakas na pag-ungol bakas sa mukha pakikibakang pasakit kalaban ay sino?  Pait ng nakaraan asin sa sugat malaya at sariwa tuluyang naghihingalo.  Impit na pag-iyak hikbing kumakawala gustuhin mang lumimot hapdi ang ala-ala.  Bangungot ang pag-asa iyon ang pamuksa sa katawang pagal sa kaluluwang patay.  Ngunit angkin niya dugong marangal hindi pasusupil anuman ang wakas.  Maliit man ang apoy sa kalungkutan ng gabi ito’y magniningas kasabay ng tala.  Yakap ang tapang siya’y mahihimbing gigising sa umaga sisilay sa araw.    Siya’y mandirigma Dugo ang sandata.

      I was not thinking of Eden or an island ever virgin, neither of a palace in the heavens.  I was not looking at the sun’s rays blinded by brilliance or the glowing boldness.  I was not hearing chimes of yin and yang or classical music.  I was not smelling cocoa on a rainy afternoon seducing the wind.  I was not tasting marshmallows vanilla and vainly sitting on my ice cream.  I was not touching the face of Venus’ perfection; nonchalant to Cupid’s tickle.  When I said I loved you… I was not shouting at the top of my lungs I was not even listening to my voice.    It was only a whisper of a heartbeat that probably got drowned in the ocean of bliss.

      Sometimes, I’d like to die And kiss the day goodbye Sometimes, I’d like to lie down And lay still on the ground.  Sometimes, I’d like to weep Until I fall asleep Sometimes, I’d like to think Until my body sinks.  Sometimes, I’d like to pray That I be happy and gay Sometimes, I’d like to wish That I swim like a fish.  Sometimes, I’d like to live All the things that I believe Sometimes, I’d like to breathe All the things that go shit.  Sometimes, I’d like to start And fade away in the dark Sometimes, I’d like to end And follow how they bend.  Sometimes, I’d like to whisper “Farewell” Sometimes, I’d like to shout “I’m gone.”

      “So this is  Barrio Mapagkumbaba .  Hmmm, I wonder where the party is”, Sophia Spaghetti’ s noodle strands stretched as she tried to peek in at the place.  Bright green, red, blue and yellow triangle-shaped objects danced over the big crowds.  There were people everywhere.  Children came running one after another.  Different sounds filled the air – bells ringing, men laughing and women chatting endlessly.  But the loudest of them all were the trumpets and drums of silver-uniformed men marching.  Leading the parade were ladies in golden dresses gracefully twirling batons and wowing everybody watching.  Sophia Spaghetti knew then that she was to be a big hit in this merry happening.  So she twirled in her thick tomato sauce, showing off her cheesy bits.  “My, I always look best in this velvety red gown.  Everyone will say  bellissima  when they see me – because I am truly beautiful… mmmwah”.  Next thing Sophia Spaghetti knew, she was placed on a very long table covered with a huge banana leaf.  She quickly swirled her slightly misplaced meatballs and looked at her companions. What she saw surprised her.  “Who… what are you!”  Sophia Spaghetti screeched.  The others stared at Sophia Spaghetti for a moment.   Sapin-Sapin  who glowed with her violet, yellow and red colors squealed with delight, “Welcome to our fiesta!”  It was the thin noodles with lots of vegetables, which spoke next.  “Hi, ” she curled up shyly, “I’m  Pasing Pancit Bihon  and I am very pleased to meet you, miss --? ”    “Who is she to ask my name as if she does not recognize me!”  Sophia Spaghetti could only mumble.  Aloud she said, “I am So-phee-ya Spaghetti from the great Pasta family!  So, is this the party?  In this small and dusty place?”   Pasing Pancit Bihon  shamefully hid under her cabbage bits and meat chunks.  Her brother  Cardo Pancit Canton , who was short, stout, and yellowish, answered instead, “This is a fiesta!  We give thanks to our patron saint who is very good to us.  And during fiestas, we have banderitas, those colorful triangles that you see hanging around.”   Cardo Pancit Canton  was proud of his town.  Sophia Spaghetti was annoyed because she does not know anything about a fiesta.  “We have none of these foolish things in the big city.  What we have are plenty of colorful and blinking lights – everywhere, every night.”   “Wow, you came from the big city!” cried the white round-shaped  Putos  as they bumped into one another.  “We’ve always wanted to go there,” they went on excitedly.  As she curved to look at them, her noodles gave out a loud swishing.  “Huh, what on earth are you!  You are totally black, like mud!”   Beside the  Putos  was the deep bowl of  Dinuguan , which turned even darker.   Dino Dinuguan  grew sad over the rude remark about his color so he kept silent.      Then Sophia Spaghetti smelled something bad.  “What’s that dreadful odor?  Oh, I can’t bear to be on this table anymore!”  The pot of orange  Kare-Kare  bubbled up in anger, “That is my good friend  Bong Bagoong .  Never judge him by his smell because once you taste him, you will surely like him.  We make a good team.”      “ Mare Kare-Kare , control yourself.  Miss Sophia Spaghetti here is our guest.  We should make her feel at home.”   Bong Bagoong  was not at all offended by how Sophia Spaghetti treated him.  “Let us all introduce ourselves so that she will know us better.”  But before anyone could start, Sophia Spaghetti sneered.  “I bet  Bong Bagoong  and  Dino Dinuguan  will be the champion leftovers here because they are the ugliest!  Shee-hee-hee!”  The others remained quiet but Sophia Spaghetti did not seem to notice.  She continued talking and scoffing at the same time.  “Why do you have such funny names?  But then again, they suit you well because you are all so funny looking.  I bet the visitors won’ t eat you at all. Their stomachs will ache from laughing hard simply by looking at you.” Sophia Spaghetti shook with laughter until her meatballs and cheese scattered.  The roasted pig lying on the middle, the King of every fiesta table, has been observing Sophia Spaghetti.  In all his shining glory, he declared, “A-hoink…A-hoink.  I am the honorable Judge  Listo Lechon .  As everybody know, ” and he looked at the others meaningfully, “it is my duty to restore the peace and order on this table.  Sophia Spaghetti…”  Sophia Spaghetti hastily interrupted and spoke in her most dramatic voice.  “I, the fairest of all noodles – the whitest and firmest of them all – is expected to listen to an old dark-skinned hog like you!  My, why don’t you just nibble on that apple in your mouth.”    The rest got angry.  To disrespect the wise and honorable Judge  Listo  was the last straw.  They all prepared to attack Sophia Spaghetti with their vegetable and meat weapons.  A food fight was about to take place when, like the true leader that he was, Judge  Listo Lechon  shook his head slowly and said, “Now, now, please calm yourselves.  Do not ever forget that we are here for the same reason.  Our duty is to feed the hungry and make everyone happy.”  Sophia Spaghetti, who grew scared at the sight of  Pasing Pancit Bihon  ready to hurl carrot sticks at her, now sighed with relief.  She jeered at the others once again, “Don’t be so jealous.  I’m sure that after they finish eating me, they will turn to you.”  “Sometimes, it’s just so hard to be the best,” she whispered to herself.  Finally, somebody shouted  -- “It’s eating time.”  Sophia Spaghetti felt the heat of excitement.  “Now, these dishes will certainly die of envy,” she snickered.  All the people flocked to the long table.  Each one wanted to taste the dishes served.  All the dishes, on the other hand, desired to be tasted.  Elders and children gathered near  Pasing Pancit Bihon .  Everyone liked her crisp vegetables and delicious chorizos.  Pasing Pancit Biho n was glad that she pleased the guests.    Everyone praised  Cardo Pancit Canton  because he was tasteful with all the large chunks of vegetables, pork, and chicken.   Cardo Pancit Canton  exchanged smiles with his sister.    The combination of  Dinuguan  and  Puto  was naturally a fiesta favorite.  So was the popular pair of  Kare-Kare  and  Bagoong .   And, of course,  Sapin-sapin  was the number one dessert.  Each dish had fun except Sophia Spaghetti.  Nobody had tasted her sweet red sauce or noticed her cheesy dress.  She felt like crying.  She never felt so embarrassed in her entire spaghetti life.  She asked herself, “Why don’t they want to eat me?”   Pasing Pancit Bihon  glanced at Sophia Spaghetti and saw that she was sinking in her thick sauce.  She coiled into a smile to cheer her up, “Don’t worry.  They’re going to like you, too.  It’s not everyday that people here see something like you.”  Sophia Spaghetti then felt sad as she realized how vain and proud she was.  She remembered how she mocked  Dino Dinuguan  and  Bong Bagoong .  She was deeply ashamed at the way she looked down on the other dishes as if she was the only one beautiful.  She spoke softly, “I am very sorry.  Please forgive me for being mean.  The honorable Judge  Listo Lechon  was right.  We were made beautiful to give happiness to everybody.”  All the dishes gave Sophia Spaghetti a warm smile.   Bong Bagoong  then  remarked, “Hey, arrange your meatballs and grated cheese now.  Your guests are here.”    Quick little footsteps rushed to the table.  Sophia Spaghetti recognized that one of them was the cute girl who grated cheese for her.  The girl asked her two playmates, “Hey, why don’t you both have spaghetti?  It tastes good.”  One of the playmates answered, “We’re not used to that kind of food.  Is it like pancit?”  The other made a face, “Yuck, is that blood all over?”  The girl urged her playmates, “C’mon, just try it.”  The playmates grabbed forks and scooped up Sophia Spaghetti.  They fell silent for awhile and then exclaimed, “You’re right, it’s delicious – it’s sour-sweet!”   The three children called on their other playmates and relatives to taste the spaghetti.  Everybody loved her.  Sophia Spaghetti was so happy.  She did not even notice that only a few noodle strands were left.  She twisted in a wide grin at the honorable Judge  Listo Lechon  and he could only wink in approval.

      Tingin ng mga bobong kapitbahay ko puta daw ako. Nagpapagamit, binabayaran. Sabi nila ako daw ang pinakamaganda at pinakasikat sa aming lugar noon. Ang bango-bango ko daw, sariwa at makinis. Di ko nga alam kung sumpa ito, dahil dito naletse ang kinabukasan ko.   Tara makinig ka muna sa kwento ko, yosi muna tayo.  Alam mo, maraming lumapit sa akin, nagkagusto, naakit. Ang hirap pag lahat sa iyo virgin eh. Tinanggap ko naman silang tao, bakit kaya nila ako ginago? Masakit alalahanin, iniisip ko na lang na kase di sila taga rito, siguro talagang ganoon. Tatlong malilibog na foreigners ang namyesta sa katawan ko, na-rape daw ako.   Sa tatlong beses akong nagahasa, ang pinakahuli ang di ko makakalimutan. Parang maski di ko ginusto ang mga nangyari, hinahanap-hanap ko siya. Tinulungan nya kasi akong makalimutan yung mga sadistang Hapon at Coño. Kase, ibang-iba ang hagod niya. Umiikot ang mundo ko sa tuwing ginagamit niya ako. Ibang klase siya mag-sorry, lalo pa at kinupkop niya ako at ang mga naging anak ko.  Parating ang dami naming regalo - may chocolates, yosi, ano ka! May datung pa! Nakakabaliw siya, alam kong ginagamit nya lang ako pero pagamit naman ako nang pagamit. Sa kanya namin natutunan mag-inggles, di lang magsulat ha! Magbasa pa! Hanggang ngayon, sa tuwing mabigat ang problema ko, siya ang tinatakbuhan ko. 'Yun nga lang, lahat ng bagay may kapalit. Nung kinasama ko siya, guminhawa buhay namin. Sosyal na sosyal kami.   Ewan ko nga ba, akala ko napapamahal na ako sa kanya. Akala ko tuloy-tuloy na kaligayahan namin, yun pala unti-unti niya akong pinapatay. P*** ng I**! Sa dami ng lason na sinaksak niya sa katawan ko, muntik na akong malaspag. Ang daming nagsabi na ang tanga tanga ko. Patalsikin ko na daw. Sa tulong ng mga anak ko, napalayas ko ang animal pero ang hirap magsimula. Masyado na kaming nasanay sa sarap ng buhay na naranasan namin sa kanya. Lubog na lubog pa kami sa utang, kulang ata pati kaluluwa namin para ibayad sa mga inutang namin.   Sinikap naming lahat maging maganda ang buhay namin. Ayun, mga nasa Japan, Hong Kong, Saudi ang mga anak ko. Yung iba nag-US, Europe. 'Yung iba ayaw umalis sa akin. Halos lahat, wala naman silbi, masaya daw sa piling ko, maski amoy usok ako.   Sa dami ng mga anak ko na nagsisikap na tulungan ang kalagayan namin, siya din ang dami ng mga anak ko na namamantala sa kabuhayan at kayaman na itinatabi ko para sa punyetang kinabukasan naming lahat. Dumating ang panahon na di na kami halos makaahon sa hirap ng buhay. Napakahirap dahil nasanay na kami sa ginhawa at sarap.  Ang di ko inaakala ay mismong mga anak ko, ang tuluyang sisira sa akin. Napakasakit tanggapin na malinlang. Akala ko ay makakakita ako ng magiging kasama sa buhay sa mga ahas na ipinakilala ng mga anak ko Hindi pala. Ang tanga ko talaga. Binugaw ako ng sarili kong mga anak kapalit ng kwarta at pansamantalang ginhawa na nais nilang matamasa.   Wala na akong nagawa dahil sa sobrang pagmamahal ko sa aking mga anak. Wala akong ibang yaman kundi ganda ko. Pinagamit ko na lang ng pinagamit ang sarili ko, basta maginhawa lang ang mga anak ko.   Usap-usapan ako ng mga kapitbahay ko. May nanghihinayang, namumuhi at naaawa. Puta na kase ang isang magandang tulad ko.  Alam mo, gusto ko na sanang tumigil sa pagpuputa kaso ang laki talaga ng letseng utang ko eh. Palaki pa ng palaki. Kulang na kulang. Paano na lang ang mga anak ko naiwan sa aking punyetang puder? Baka di na ako balikan o bisitahin ng mga nag-abroad kong mga anak. Hindi na importante kung laspagin man ang ganda ko, madama ko lang ang pagmamahal ng mga anak ko. Malaman nila na gagawin ko ang lahat para sa kanila.  Sa tuwing titingin ako sa salamin, alam ko maganda pa rin ako. Meron pa din ang bilib sa akin. Napapag usapan pa din. Sa tuwing nakikita ko ang mukha ko sa salamin, nakikita ko ang mga anak ko. Tutulo na lang ang mga luha ko ng di ko namamalayan. Ang gagaling nga ng mga anak ko, namamayagpag kahit saan sila pumunta. Mahusay sa kahit anong gawin. Tama man o mali. Proud ako sa kanila. Kaso sila, kabaligtaran ang nararamdaman para sa akin.   Sa dami ng mga anak ko, iilan lang ang may malasakit sa akin. May malasakit man, nahihilaw. Ni di nga ako kinikilalang ina. Halos lahat sila galit sa isa't isa. Walang gusto magtulungan, naghihilahan pa. Ang dami ko ng pasakit na tiniis pero walang sasakit pa nung sarili kong mga anak ang nagbugaw sa akin. Kinapital ang laspag na ganda ko. Masyado silang nasanay sa sarap ng buhay. Minsan sa pagtingin ko sa salamin, ni hindi ko na nga kilala sarili ko.  Dadating na naman ang pasko, sana maalala naman ako ng mga anak ko. Isang buwan pa, magbabagong taon na. Natatakot ako sa taong darating. Ngayon pa lang usap usapan na ang susunod na pagbubugaw ng ilan sa mga anak ko. Sana may magtanggol naman sa akin, ipaglaban naman nila ako. Gusto kong isigaw: "INA NINYO AKO! MAHALIN NYO NAMAN AKO!"  Sige, dumadrama na ako. Masisira na ang make up ko nito eh. Salamat ha, pinakinggan mo ako.  Ay sorry, di ko nasabi pangalan ko.   Pilipinas nga pala.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too many people put off something that brings them joy just because they haven't thought about it, don't have it on their schedule, didn't know it was coming or are too rigid to depart from their routine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got to thinking one day about all those women on the Titanic who passed up dessert at dinner that fateful night in an effort to cut back.&nbsp; From then on, I've tried to be a little more flexible.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many women out there will eat at home because their husband didn't suggest going out to dinner until after something had been thawed?&nbsp; Does the word "refrigeration" mean nothing to you?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How often have your kids dropped in to talk and sat in silence while you watched you favorite television show?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot count the times I called my sister and said, "How about going to lunch in a half hour?" She would gas up and stammer, "I can't. I have clothes on the line.&nbsp; My hair is dirty..."   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because people nowadays cram so much into their lives, we tend to schedule our headaches...We live on a sparse diet of promises we make to ourselves when all the conditions are perfect!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll go back and visit the grandparents when we get Stevie toilet-trained.&nbsp; We'll entertain when we replace the living room carpet.&nbsp; We'll go on a second honeymoon when we get two more kids out of college.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life has a way of accelerating as we get older.&nbsp; The days get shorter, and the list of promises to ourselves gets longer.&nbsp; One morning, we awaken, and all we have to show for our lives is a litany of&nbsp; "I'm going to," "I plan on,"&nbsp; and&nbsp; "Someday, when things are settled down a bit."   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now...go on and have a nice day.&nbsp; Do something you WANT to...not something on your SHOULD DO list. If you were going to die soon and had only one phone call you could make, who would you call and what would you say?&nbsp; And why are you waiting? Make sure you read this to the end; you will understand why I sent this to you.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever watched kids playing on a merry go round or listened to the rain lapping on the ground?&nbsp; Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight or gazed at the sun into the fading night?&nbsp; Do you run through each day on the fly?&nbsp; When you ask "How are you?" Do you hear the reply?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the day is done, do you lie in your bed with the next hundred chores running through your head?&nbsp; Ever told your child, "We'll do it tomorrow."&nbsp; And in your haste, not see his sorrow?&nbsp; Ever lost touch?&nbsp; Let a good friendship die?&nbsp; Just call to say "Hi"?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you worry and hurry through your day, it is like an unopened gift...Thrown away...Life is not a race. Take it slower.&nbsp; Hear the music before the song is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To those I have sent this to... I care for you &amp; cherish our friendship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Life may not be the party we hoped for...but while we are here we might as well dance!"&nbsp; &nbsp;

      One day a young man was standing in the middle  of the town proclaiming that he had the most  beautiful heart in the whole valley.   A large crowd gathered and they all admired his  heart for it was perfect. There was not a mark  or a flaw in it. Yes, they all agreed it truly  was the most beautiful heart they had ever seen.   The young man was very proud and boasted more  loudly about his beautiful heart.   Suddenly, an old man appeared at the front of  the crowd and said "Why your heart is not nearly  as beautiful as mine."   The crowd and the young man looked at the old  man's heart. It was beating strongly, but  full of scars, it had places where pieces had  been removed and other pieces put in, but they  didn't fit quite right and there were several  jagged edges. In fact, in some places there were  deep gouges where whole pieces were missing.   The people stared - how can he say his heart is  more beautiful, they thought? The young man  looked at the old man's heart and saw its  state and laughed. "You must be joking," he  said. "Compare your heart with mine, mine is  perfect and yours is a mess of scars and tears."   "Yes," said the old man, "Yours is perfect  looking but I would never trade with you. You  see, every scar represents a person to whom I  have given my love - I tear out a piece of my  heart and give it to them, and often they give  me a piece of their heart which fits into  the empty place in my heart, but because the  pieces aren't exact, I have some rough edges,  which I cherish, because they remind me of the  love we shared. Sometimes I have given pieces of  my heart away, and the other person hasn't  returned a piece of his heart to me. These  are the empty gouges -- giving love is taking a  chance.   Although these gouges are painful, they stay  open, reminding me of the love I have for these  people too, and I hope someday they may  return and fill the space I have waiting. So now  do you see what true beauty is?"   The young man stood silently with tears running  down his cheeks. He walked up to the old man,  reached into his perfect young and beautiful  heart, and ripped a piece out. He offered it to  the old man with trembling hands. The old man  took his offering, placed it in his heart and  then took a piece from his old scarred heart and  placed it in the wound in the young man's heart.  It fit, but not perfectly, as there were some  jagged edges. The young man looked at his heart,  not perfect anymore but more beautiful than  ever, since love from the old man's heart flowed  into his. They embraced and walked away side by  side.   How sad it must be to go through life with a  whole untouched heart.

       By Marjorie Holmes     THAT KIND WORD "MAYBE"    My parents never had much money, but they enriched us by their use of  that wonderful word "maybe."   Much of the time it was a hope word. When we'd plead, "Can I have a  new bike?" "Are we going to the circus?" Dad would have to ponder.  "Maybe," he would say, not wanting to make a promise he couldn't keep.   "Maybe" was also their word for dreaming. "Maybe next summer we can  take a trip to the ocean." "Maybe someday we can buy a little farm with a  brook.   But the thing I remember best is that "maybe" was a word for making  allowances for others. Whenever one of us would make a snap judgement, we  would hear it. "Just look at the poor lady loading all those groceries in  the car while her husband sits there. Why doesn't he help her?" "Maybe  he's been sick," Dad sympathized. "Maybe he's had a heart attack." Or,  Doesn't that woman look awful. Her slip's showing and she's got a big run  in her stocking." Mother: "Maybe her strap broke and she doesn't have a  safety pin. Maybe she doesn't know about the run."   All this came back to me one awful day when my brakes failed in city  traffic. Terrified, I couldn't even pause at lights except to go bucking  into neutral. "You fool! Why don't you learn to drive?" a passing motorist  bawled.   In my instant hurt and outrage I wanted to bellow back, "You're rude,  you're mean! Can't you see I'm in trouble?" I didn't -- it wouldn't have  done any good. But that's not what stopped my tirade. It was simply the  healing word "maybe." Maybe the man was already tired and mad and  hurting. Maybe he's just been fired, or his mate is leaving him. Maybe  nobody ever taught him to control his temper. Maybe he can't help it!   Still praying desperately, I finally made it to a filling station and  safely home -- too grateful to blame anybody, and so relieved I found  myself praying for that man.   DEAR LORD, don't let me be so quick to judge people. We all have burdens  and reasons others can't see. No matter what the provocation, help each of  us to remember that kind word maybe.

       The Stench Of Hatred   A kindergarten teacher has decided to let her class play a game. The teacher told each child in the class to bring along a plastic bag containing a few potatoes. Each potato will be given a name of a person that the child hates, so the number of potatoes that a child will put in his/her plastic bag will depend on the number of people he/she hates. So when the day came, every child brought some potatoes with the name of the people he/she hated. Some had 2 potatoes; some 3,while some up to 5 potatoes. The teacher then told the children to carry with them the potatoes in the plastic bag wherever they go (even to the toilet) for 1 week. Days after days passed by, and the children started to complain due to the unpleasant smell let out by the rotten potatoes. Besides, those having 5 potatoes also had to carry heavier bags. After 1 week, the children were relieved because the game had finally ended. The teacher asked: "How did you feel while carrying the potatoes with you for 1 week?" The children let out their frustrations and started complaining of the trouble that they had to go through having to carry the heavy and smelly potatoes wherever they go. Then the teacher told them the hidden meaning behind the game. The teacher said: "This is exactly the situation when you carry your hatred for somebody inside your heart. The stench of hatred will contaminate your heart and you will carry it with you wherever you go. If you cannot tolerate the smell of rotten potatoes for just 1 week, can you imagine what is it like to have the stench of hatred in your heart for your lifetime???"   "Forgiveness is not something you do for someone else; it is something you do for yourself. Give yourself the gift of forgiveness"

When all this I was going through You never took the time To ask me just what you could do I only know that I can change Everything else just stays the same So now I step out of the darkness that my life became 'cause  I just needed someone to talk to You were just to busy with yourself You were never there for me To express how I felt I just stuffed it down Now I'm older and I feel like I could let some of this anger fade But it seems the surface I am scratching Is the bed that I have made I never meant to fade... Away I never meant to fade I just needed someone to talk to You were just to busy with yourself You were never there for me To express how I felt I just stuffed it down Now I'm older and I feel like I could let some of this anger fade But it seems the surface I am scratching Is the bed that I have made I try to breathe...   Don't Stay    Sometimes I Need to remember just to breathe Sometimes I Need you to stay away from me Sometimes I'm In disbelief I didn't know Somehow I Need you to go Sometimes I Feel like I trusted you too well Sometimes I Just feel like screaming at myself Somestimes I'm In Disbelief I didn't know Somehow I Need to be alone Don't stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities What you were changing me into [Just give me myself back and] Don't stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities Take all your faithlessness with you [Just give me myself back and] Don't Stay I don't need you anymore I don't want to be ignored I don't need one more day Of you wasting me away With no apologies    Somewhere I Belong    When this began I had nothing to say And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me I was confused And I let it all out to find/That I'm Not the only person with these things in mind Inside of me But all the vacancy the words revealed Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel Nothing to lose Just stuck/Hollow and alone And the fault is my own And the fault is my own I want to heal I want to feel What I thought was never real I want to let go of the pain I've held so long [Erase all the pain 'til it's gone] It's gone]  I want to heal I want to feel Like I'm close to something real I want to find something I've wanted all along Somewhere I Belong And I've got nothing to say I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face I was confused Looking everywhere/Only to fin that it's Not the way I had imagined it all in my mind So what am I What do I have but negativity 'Cause I can't justify the Way everyone is looking at me Nothing to lose Nothing to gain/Hollow and alone And the fault is my own The fault is my own I will never know Myself until I do this on my own And I will never feel Anything else until my wounds are healed I will never be Anything 'til I break away from me And I will break away I'll find myself today I want to heal I want to feel like I'm Somewhere I belong    Lying From You    When I pretend Everything is what I want it to be I look exactly like what you had always Wanted to see When I pretend I can forget about the criminal I am Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can/But I can't pretend this is the way It will stay/I'm just Trying to bend the truth I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be So I'm Lying my way from you [No/No turning back now] I wanna be pushed aside So let me go [No/No turning back now] Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone [No turning back now] Anywhere on my own 'Cause I can see [No/No turning back now] The very worst part of you Is me I remember what they taugt to me Remember condescending talk Of who I ought to be Remember listening to all of that And this again So I pretended up a person who was fitting in And now you think this person Really is me and I'm [Trying to bend the truth] But the more I push The more I'm pulling away 'Cause I'm Lying my way from you This isn't what I wanted to be I never thought that what I said Would have you running from you Like this The very worst part of you The very worst part of you Is me    Easier to Run    It's easier to run Replacing this pain with something numb It's so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone Something has been taken From deep inside of me A secret I've kept locked away No one can ever see Wounds so deep they never show They never go away Like moving pictures in my head For years and years they've played If I could change I would Take back the pain I would Retrace every wrong move that I made I would If I could Stand up and take the blame I would If I could take all the shame to the grave I Would Sometimes I remember The darkness of my past Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have Sometimes I think of letting go And never looking back And never moving forward so There would never be a past Just washing it aside All of the helplessness inside Pretending I don't feel misplaced Is so much simpler than change It's easier to run Replacing this pain with something numb It's so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone   Faint    I am Little bit of loneliness A little bit of disregard A handful of complaints But I can't help the fact That everyone can see these scars I am What I want you to want What I want you to feel But it's like No matter what I do I can't convince you To just believe this is real So I let go Watching you Turn your back like you always do Face away and pretend that i'm not But i'll be here 'Cause you're all I got I am A little bit insecure A little unconfident 'Cause you don't understand I do what I can But sometimes I don't make sense I am What you never want to say But i've never had a doubt It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you For once just to hear me out So I let go Watching you Turn your back like you always do Face away and pretend that i'm not But i'll be here 'Cause you're all I got I can't feel The way I did before Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored Time won't heal This damage anymore Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored No Hear me out now You're gonna listen to me Like it or not Right now   Breaking The Habit    Memories consume Like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume I'm safe here in my room [Unless I try to start again] I don't want to be the one The battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize That i'm the one confused I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit Tonight Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more Than anytime before I had no options left again I'll paint it on the walls 'Cause i'm the one at fault I'll never fight again And this is how it ends I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity To show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit Breaking the Habit Tonight   Nobody's Listening    Peep the style and the kids checking for it The number one question is How could you ignore it We drop right back in the cut Over basement tracks With raps that got you backing this up like [Rewind that] We're just rolling with the rhythm Rise from the ashes of stylistic division With these non-stop lyrics of life living Not to be forgotten But still unforgiven But in the meantime there are those who wanna Talk this and that So I suppose it gets to a point feelings gotta get hurt And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt [It goes] Try to give you warning But everyone ignores me [Told you everything loud and clear] But nobody's listening Call to you so clearly But you don't want to hear me [Told you everything loud and clear] But nobody's listening I got a Heart full of pain Head full of stress Handful of anger Held in my chest And everything left is a waste of time I hate my rhymes [But hate everyone else's more] I'm riding on the back of this pressure Guessing that it's better I can't keep myself together Because all of this stress Gave me something to write on The pain gave me something I could set my sights on You never forget the blood sweat and tears The uphill struggle over years The fear and trash talking And the people it was to And the people that started it Just like you  I got a Heart full of pain Head full of stress Handful of anger Held in my chest Uphill struggle Blood, sweat and tears Nothing to gain Everything to fear [Coming at you]   Numb     I'm tired of being what you want me to be Feeling so faithless Lost under the surface I don't know what you're expecting of me Put under the pressure Of walking in your shoes [Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow] Every step that I take is another mistake to you  I've Become so numb I can't feel you there Become so tired So much more aware I'm becoming this All I want to do Is be more like me And be less like you Can't you see that you're smothering me Holding too tightly Afraid to lose control 'Cause everything that you thought I would be Has fallen apart right in front of you [Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow] Every step that I take is Another mistake to you [Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow] And every second I waste Is more than I can take  And I know I may end up failing too But I know You were just like me With someone disappointed in you
