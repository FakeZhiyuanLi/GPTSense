      The best time for me to write is when I'm driving in my car...if only I could.  That's become my thinking time...40 minutes each way, to work and back, gives me alot of time to ponder things.    There are those times, however, after a long day, I just don't want to think about anything important anymore.  That's when I pick up my phone to call a friend.  I think about escaping from my life for just a little while...a friendly chat, a connection with someone other than a chronically ill patient.  Downtime connection.  Driving home, today, I decided to chat, rather than think. I reached for my phone, running through a list of names; who do I want to chat with today?  My list, and my thoughts, went something like this...  Hmmm...I can call home - I wonder where the kids are?  I think Jon is working today...or was that yesterday?  I haven't seen him in days...this 16 year old stage always drives me crazy.  When he's not working, he's locked in his room, or he's at a friend's house.  They used to all hang out at our house...not anymore.  I wonder what changed?  I know Dave is working, he told me last night he wouldn't be able to help me with dinner tonight.    (I called and got the answering machine again.)  I wonder why I even try to contact them anymore?  Hmmm...I may have the evening to myself tonight.  I wonder if I'll ever get used to it?  Well, I've got plenty to do when I get home...  I'll just call Tara...she's probably working too. I'll leave her a message... I did reach Tara, and found myself babbling on about nothing in particular...nothing she was at all interested in.  I think I told her I'd "see her soon" 4 seperate times. It became obvious to me that I didn't really want to hang up, but I could tell she was just being polite.  I said my goodbyes and thought about how much I needed to contact someone who didn't "need" me, or think I only had a terribly boring parent-type conversation to share; someone I could just talk "nothing" to.  Then I thought about Dennis... No, I can't call him.  He probably doesn't understand one thing about me after the letter I wrote the other day. Maybe I never understood him. Perhaps I just created this beautiful romance to entertain myself for the past 3 years. Perhaps it was just to entertain him.    I think I've finally let go of Dennis, intellectually. I still love him. What's new?  It won't do any good to call him.  I don't want to see him.  I'll just fall into his arms again, we'll make incredible love, and then he'll turn a cold shoulder and push me away.  Again.  Except that one weekend.  What was it, a month ago?  What an incredible weekend that was!  I had been in Orlando at a Peak Potentials seminar.  He tried to get ahold of me every day. Now that was NOT like Dennis.  There were weeks at a time when I never heard from him. But that weekend was different.  He couldn't wait to see me.  He was in Florida, too, and he wanted to meet me; to rendezvous.  I couldn't make it happen, though.  It would be another week before we would be able to get together.    The anticipation was nearly overwhelming...and amazing!  We spoke daily, flirted, talked about how incredible our lovemaking would be, planned our meeting. I'd see him Saturday afternoon, 1:00.  I drove to his place, an hour away.  As always, I plugged in a Celtic CD...Gaelic Storm...and drove across the mountain, past fields of green, framed by tall pines and hardwoods. My eyes took it all in.  I knew this route by heart, and it was my favorite route to drive.  At the end of it was my sweet Dennis.    The music carried me away. It always reminded me of him and my heart soared.  Oh, how I wish I could go to Ireland with him this year!  I am so taken by this man.  I am 18 again...and I am such a fool...but I don't care; not now. There is so much joy to be had...so much pleasure.  He's only around the next bend.  When I arrived, he swept me into his arms and held me next to his heart.  I could feel it beating, matching my heart's rythmn.  He kissed me, tentatively at first, then passionately.  I never made it past the front door, that day.  We had known one another for 3 years, and it was still the same...still the passion, the incredible passion.  We loved one another for hours...time drifted away unnoticed.  He kissed every inch of my body, leaving chills along the way. He satisfied me time and again, until I could no longer move.  Then, I loved him like he had never been loved before, fulfilling his every desire, pushing his need to the limit until he could no longer hold back.  We lay in each other arms, Dennis whispering his love for me, pulling me closer, as though he would take me into his body with him.  And I thought, "Finally."  That night, I slept with him and loved him, and he loved me.  My whole body smiles as I think about that weekend.  But that was then.    He often cooked dinner, and offered a glass of Irish Whiskey, after we made love, which I always enjoyed.  But then it was time to go. I always knew it was time...He found a way to remind me that he was a loner and that he couldn't be what I needed. He would tell me, once again, that he would be the best friend I would ever have.  And I would drive that hour-long drive, in the dark, filled with joy and hope, and sadness and confusion, and dreams of Dennis.   This feeling in my heart doesn't seem to end.  Joy and hope, sadness and confusion...and longing. Longing for a dream unfulfilled; an impossible dream. It feels as though he's sitting on my chest and I can hardly breath.    It has been a long road, 3 years, and I'm almost home...and I need to let things be.  I've loved him for 3 years while he's played with my heart.  He was never dishonest about his desires, I know that.  It was  my  dream.    And, romance is like anything else in life. It must be looked at logically, with a strength of mind, tempered with the gentleness of heart. Is it good for me?  Or is it bad for me? Am I going to allow myself to follow a wise thought, to create a wise heart?     Sometimes it's best to let the dream go...  It seems it was thinking time, afterall.

      I don't remember how many times in my life I have felt this feeling.  I wish I could pack up everything I own and run away.  Then, again, I wonder what the use of packing would be.  Maybe it would be better to just run, with no baggage...just me and the road; me and the wind; me and the sun. Freedom.  This time the feeling is stronger. It's a feeling of drowning in my own life, in my own creation, and fighting for air. I can see myself breaking free, gulping air as I run blindly.  I only know that any direction must be better than drowning...and finding life again is bound to bring joy.  I have an wonderful life, really...at least by most standards.  I live with my 3 children in the middle of a beautiful town in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  I am a healer...or so they call me.  I am successful in my work.  I'm even in demand.  I drive a new car and wear nice clothes, live in a nice home, have a beautiful office where I work with the most excellent, caring, and compassionate alternative MD's (there are such things)...and my children are even great people!  From the outside, all looks well.    But all is not well.  Everyday I wonder whether I will make it through the day.  This isn't me; at least not the me I want to be.  Aren't I the one who teaches others the power of thought?    Last time I ran away was nearly 7 years ago. I left Texas behind, hoping for a bright new experience.  A new life with my family. A re-creation.  2 years into my new life, when things weren't "quite right" , I mused that when I left Texas I brought ME with me.  The same me that struggled there, and moved here to become so much more.   So, who have I become this time? And, if I'm not who I want to be, what must I do to become her?    And, can I do it this time without running? Wasn't this the reason I was given the name "Wisehart"...a reminder to strive, to pull together everything I have ever been, even through the hard times, to become...wise?  And then, to share that wisdom?  Use the wisdom, Moon...wisdom from life, from the ancients, from the Divine...it all lies within you.  It lies within each of us. Reach down deep, remember the learnings...  I can't help but hope to grasp this lifeline and pull myself, once again, to safety, to joy, to freedom.

         I should be working.  All the shoulds of my life seem to pile on top of me, leaving me feeling overwhelmed and weak.  So...I think I'll just relax and catch hold of my thoughts.  Perhaps I'll find a bit of wisdom along this road.    The past few weeks have been a study in contrasts.  How strange things have been...Where to start?     It was an experience with 2 men that made me aware of the contrasts in my life.  It was the beginning of many. Okay, first I must say I love men.  I have had a long and varied history of relationships. Since I am not, currently, in a relationship, I could say that, in one way or another, all of them have failed.  Yet, in all fairness, in one way or another, all of them have been successful.       Some may say that I NEED a man in my life.  I don't think that's true.  I have been making it on my own for so many years, raising these kids, man or no man.  I am, what some may consider, a strong woman...a survivor.  But on the inside, I'm soft.  On the inside I wish I weren't so strong...that I never had to be. Perhaps some men have wanted me to "need" a man...maybe that's what my husbands wanted. I never learned to rely on them...actually, I learned that I couldn't rely on them. Yet I continue searching within myself for answers to why I haven't been able to sustain a relationship.      And I keep dating.     So...2 weeks ago, I met Michael.  He had sent me an icebreaker on Tickle on the very day I was going to take my profile off.  I had decided I would focus on  anything  except dating men...a piecrust promise.  Then Michael, beautiful Michael, popped into my awareness.  His profile was interesting.  He expressed himself well.  He was good looking...whew...gorgeous.  And he lived only an hour away.  Okay...so one more try.     After a month of notes, he offered his phone #, and I offered mine.  We met in a public parking lot, had a great conversation over dinner, and a week later, a Sunday sexy trip to an amazing waterfall; then he invited me to his home. He was exciting, and set me on edge...and I wanted to be with him. And, it was at the waterfall that I learned he was running for Congress.      Oh, so THAT's the project that will keep you busy until July 19th!  Why didn't you tell me before?  His retort was that he wanted me to like him for HIM, not for being a candidate to Washington. Silly man.      And, things would soon get more interesting.     I had plans that Sunday to visit a new acquaintance, Stephen. We were to meet at 4PM at his place, and eat at a downtown sidewalk restaurant.  I had had all morning free so, when Michael called,  the waterfall trip fit in nicely at 11AM.    I left the waterfall, intriqued by this man Michael...and was off to meet Stephen.  Now, here, some would say I was crazy.    Stephen lives in a condo in downtown Asheville.  He is intelligent and classy...and he has heart.  He had a tumor on his brainstem removed many years ago and has lost some of his physical balance and ability.  But his intellect intact, his talents and mental abilities shine through.  He has been extremely successful in his life, creating a comfortably abundant lifestyle.  And, he is not my picture of "relationship" material since he is several inches shorter than I am.  At 5'10", I am taller than so many men.     Conversation with Stephen proved fascinating and time seemed to stand still and fly all at once.  We have so much in common. I enjoyed the energy of his home, open and airy, filled with modern art, plants and crystals, and other things of beauty.  It was lovely and I could tell he had carefully chosen each piece, surrounding himself with things that he loves.     After dinner, I rushed off to meet Michael at his home.  He had dropped off his daughter and would have time to "clean up the place" before I got there.  He met me on the highway to lead me to his home, nestled in the mountains.  I wasn't sure I'd find my way back and began to worry a bit...but the memory of the waterfall, and his passionate kisses kept me in towe.    We turned into a paved driveway, a bit of a commodity in these mountains, and it wound to and fro.  I thought, "wow, he must have a nice home to have paved this long drive!"  The trees parted, revealing a large metal building, surrounded by large trucks and other equipment.  Okay...where's the house?    He parked and I pulled up next to him.  He pointed...there it was...a travel trailer parked in the back of the metal warehouse.  This was it.  His home.  I went inside.  How long had he lived here?  3 years.  It was paid for.  So was his truck.  That was part of his campaign..."My house and car are paid for, so I'm not running for the money..."    It was at that moment that I became acutely aware of the contrasts that exist in my life.  In that one day, I had bathed in the sunlight; played my flute to the sound of the wind, water and birds; climbed rocks and showered in a waterfall; was romanced, and passionately kissed a facade(okay he was a gorgeous man); sat in a beautifully appointed home; ate dinner at a downtown cafe; spoke of philosophy, compassion, relationships, music and businesses; wildly drove a mountain road; and landed here...in a small, dirty travel trailer...where I was to...make love?????    Love?  Okay...on second thought, maybe it could just be good sex.

      A warm sunny day...I guide my car along the winding mountain road.  The sun peaks through the tall pines and hardwoods.  It warms my skin as the breeze toussles my hair. Life feels wonderful!   I approach my driveway, turning between the river-rock walls built to invite, rather than deter. As I travel the drive, I marvel at the beauty of the gardens, flowers growing among the native bushes and trees, filling the air with their sweet scent.  On the South-facing hill, my organic vegetable garden flourishes and I know that tonight's dinner will include the fresh tastes and textures it will provide. My Great Dane runs to greet me, barking and wagging his tail, anxious to let me know he's missed me. Blossom, my cat, lazily sunbathes near the gazebo.  I park my car and walk over to pet her.  My eyes meet the beauty of the mountains that lay before me, layered, one behind the other.  It seems they could go on forever.  The green valley stretches before me as the sun streams through the clouds and I know that, soon, nature will provide the pinks and purples of a glorious sunset.  I am still amazed that this sense of freedom, in all its beauty lies so close to town. I turn toward my home.  Aaahh, home, sweet, home! Nestled in, at the edge of the woods, it is inviting and warm.  Built of stone and logs, it seems to fit in this setting.  The front door is inviting and opens to wooden floors and light filled rooms.  The energy flows easily and, in it's openness, it feels bigger than it is.  As I walk into the great room, I can see the mountain views once again and I know the grand deck is only steps away.  It beckons me to put my feet up and take in the view.  I go to the kitchen in search of a cool glass of clear water. It's open and warm, light and modern, efficient and beautifully designed. The kitchen's always been the gathering place for friends and family; so often, joy and laughter seem to fill the room and make it even lighter.  As I move out to the deck, I pass our large fireplace.  I, sometimes, long for the warmth of a blazing fire, even in the summertime.  My eyes catch the new blossoms of orchids in the sunroom. The sound of the fountain, adorned by plants and natural art from these mountains and around the world, still brings rest to my spirit. I'll meditate there before bed, this evening. I hear my sons and call to them to join me.  Happy to see me, they begin chattering about their day, laughing and cutting up as they are known to do.  I love my life. It isn't long before I'm greeted by the man I love as he comes in from his day of creation and adventure. He holds me in his arms and kisses my neck; a promise of events and passions to come. We share thoughts, ideas, and the events of the day as we prepare a simple meal.  He is my partner; we love and support one another's dreams; we laugh and play and work.  I have dreamt of him, and he is here.  As the sun sets, I glance over toward the barn, wondering how the horses and our few bison are fairing today.  I am thankful for our friend, David, who has found his dream in taking care of these fine creatures.  They are so beautiful to watch and have proven to be a wonderful source of prosperity lately.  I wave at David as he sits on his deck, above the barn.  He, too loves these mountain sunsets. After dinner and meditation, we retire to our bedroom.  It is a large room but, still, warm and inviting.  A place where love grows, dreams are dreamed and plans are made. This is the place where our deepest conversations take place; a haven from the outside world. And I know that, in the morning when I rise, the warmth of this home will invite me to greet life with all the creative force that God has given me.
