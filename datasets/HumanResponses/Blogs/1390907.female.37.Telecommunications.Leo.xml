						   1. I'm 6' tall 2. I've never play basketball 3. I have a fear of heights so much so that I scream like girl when I get near windows. 4. I HATE green and red peppers 5. I've been to 14 countries - which surprises even me. 6. I love to cook and I love to have people visit me. 7. If you visit me, you will be fed. 8. I believe ‘Cabaret’ is the greatest musical ever. 9. I was viciously attacked by a dog when I was 4 10. I still really love dogs. 11. I write murder mystery parties. 12. Nom de Guerre - Glacia. 13. I’m the last of 7 children. 14. I have two ex-husbands. 15. 8 years ago I made up my mind to remain single. 16. Then I met my soulmate and got married again. 17. Despite my serial marriages, like Ross on ‘Friends’ I don’t want to be one of ‘those’ people. 18. Due to a childhood trauma involving splinters on the soles of my feet, I forbid anyone from touching my feet. 19. I am Canadian, I love my country – but I’d move to Oslo in a heartbeat. 20. I should become a famous author so that I can move to Oslo – in a heartbeat. 21. Before I die, I want to eat sushi at a baseball game in Tokyo. 22. My name is Jacqueline. You may call me Jackie, You can even call me Jax. But if you want to me ‘Jack’, you should be willing to give me a kidney if I should need it. (Siblings, best friend, husband). 23. I am BLESSED with the greatest group of friends from university. 24. My best friend is the smartest woman in the world. 25. I didn’t change my name when I got married for many reason, the least of which is that I would become Jackie Robinson and I suck at baseball. 26. I cannot stand people who litter. 27. I REALLY cannot stand people who jump lines.  28. I’m straight, but not narrow. 29. I call myself a Christian 30. I also call myself a feminist 30. I was born in Barrie, Ontario.  We moved to Surrey BC when I was four and I fled to Toronto when I was 17. 31. I would list my family’s religion as Cashew. 33. I think they’re probably right when they say don’t talk about politics or religion at dinner parties. 34. ‘Hedwig and the Angry Inch’ is my definitive cult movie. I relate far too much to that flick – in ways that I can’t possibly explain.  35. To clarify the last point – I’ve never had a sex change. 36. My father is from a family of 16, my mother is from a family of 6 – which means that I have a million cousins and any stranger could be my cousin. 37. But not Mike Myers. 38. I have an ongoing novel about a time traveling daughter of post communist Russia 39. I’ve been to Russia – it was weird. 40. I think the following people are funny: Groucho Marx (his writing), Sid Caeser, Ellen, Chris Rock, Dennis Leary, Harvey Korman and Jack Black 41. I recently started drinking root beer instead of coke because I feel it will make look cooler. 42. I’m an army brat. 43. I shouldn’t be eating animal products – my body doth protest too much – so for the most part I don’t. 44. I’m a sucker for Vodka. 45. I could never feel bad while either the theme from Oklahoma OR ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ is being played. 46. I could also never be silent while they’re playing. 47. I’m 2 years away from my 40th birthday and I’m already planning the party. You’re all invited. 48. I doubt that I’ll ever have kids and that's okay with me. 49. But I do have two beautiful foster kids (Rennukama and Rosemary) in far away lands. 50. I always take the magazine that is at the back of the stack.  It's fresher. 51. My ‘signature’ scent is Amarige by Givenchy 52. Having a ‘signature scent’ is about as high maintenance as I get. 53. I’m in a mixed marriage. My husband’s Pisces and I’m Leo. But we work through it very well. 54. I left home at 17. Not cause it sucked there, I just wanted to get out and see the world. 55. My biggest regret is not spending a year or two overseas. 56. I had that opportunity, but I didn’t take it, because of this stupid stockbroker I was dating – whom I broke up within 3 months. 57. I am often mistaken for Polish 58. I’ve danced on a table at an Irish pub in NYC after a World Cup game. 59. I can’t believe I live in a world that needs Dr. Phil. 60. On the day I was born, Peppermint Patty made her debut in the Peanuts cartoon. 61. I really like to drink and make no apologies for it 62. I don’t do drugs – just cause I don’t like feeling out of control. 63. I’m allergic to sulpha drugs. 64. My body will probably outlast my legs. I’ve had ski injuries and am developing arthritis in my knees. 65. My dog and cat cause me endless stress and endless joy. 66. If I could be anything in the world, I’d be an opera singer. 67. My favorite Opera is Zauberflöte. 68. Favorite aria is Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen (My heart is seething with hellish vengeance, death and despair are blazing around me!) from the above mentioned opera. 69. I broke my nose when I was four, but you’d never know. 70. I hate whip cream. 71. I know more about sports than my husband – but that ain’t saying much 72. I love EM Forester and Mikhail Buglakov 73. I understand that all of us have to work for a living, but somehow I always thought I would be the exception. 74. I know people who are the exception – and it kind of bugs me. 75. I think jealousy is such a useless emotion, but feels so good. 76. I can’t stand the people in my neighbourhood because they are double incomed, no kid, dog owning, trendy food eating freaks and the wives are all blond. 77. Funnily enough, I’ve just described our household – but we’re different. 78. I’m double jointed. 79. I’m happiest with caviar, champagne, cigarettes, and a good time Charlie on hand. 80. And for some reason my husband understands this. 81. I grew up in Surrey – a 24 hour live Jerry Springer show. 82. But I still proudly call myself a Surrey Chick. 83. My favorite movie as a kid was ‘Funny Girl’. 84. All I can say is - Nobody better rain on MY parade. 85. I got a major thing for Latin and Russian men. 86. When I’m scared I sing the scores from ‘Pal Joey’ and ‘Guys and Dolls’. 87. My favorite food is crab. 88. For reasons to numerous to explain, my husband thinks I wrote the theme to 'Green Acres' 89. I’d like to run a marathon in Kenya one day. 90. I never went to kindergarten 91. I once had a song written about me. 92. That song was the theme to ‘Saved By The Bell’. 93. I’m hoping my grand niece will care for me in my old age. 94. I used to play the alto saxophone and the French horn 95. I’m tone deaf 96. I know how to sew, cross stitch and do origami 97. I enter every free contest I see. 98. I once sat in Fred MacMurray’s chair and got Edith Head’s autograph. 99. I never finish anything I start 100. … 101. .  Interests Writing, showtunes, running, boozing and foolin' around.

      I'm thinking of Christmas at home.  A real Christmas memory, not one of those fake ones I come up with where my family stands around the Christmas tree singing 'Oh Come All Ye Faithful' - in Latin.  Where the 12 days of christmas felt banner hung over the fireplace.  The fireplace on and warm.  New toys to be had and played with.  New joke book.  Typewriter.  lego.  tinsle on the tree - put up string by string because my mother could be a nazi about that.  nuts in the bowl.  sausage rolls  mincemeat.  mandarin oranges.
