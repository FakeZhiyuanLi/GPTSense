      Well in order to have justification to get our team together in one class, or at least under one E.D.D. teacher, we've started looking at entering other science competitions. Tomorrow I plan on getting the team together and show our proposal for some massive schedule changes, application forms and rules for the  urlLink Intel International Science and Engineering Fair , the  urlLink Siemens Westinghouse , and the  urlLink Toshiba NSTA ExploraVision  competitions. Hopefully we will be able to enter at least one of these competitions and use our contestant status as grounds to get our group together.

      The second phase of the experiment was a success.  After the bottle cooled (sealed) for about an hour (till it was at room temperature), I stuck it back into the microwave.  Within 50 seconds there were small bubbles, and within 56 seconds there was a roaring boiling.  Wow... compared to the 1:24 of the standard air pressure (101 kPa), :56 is a great time.  This is especially true when you consider that there was 6 ounces of water and 26 ounces of air in the container.  In theory, the more water we have, the more substantial difference in times there will be.   I need to double check the first time (unsealed bottle in microwave).  I will do that just as soon as the bottle and water cool down.  I didn't time it specifically, but I seem to remember that I started with 3 minutes, and ended with 1:36.  I will let you know as soon as I reconduct the experiment.  Wow... I am so excited.  I can't believe this theory actually works in practice.  What is better is that the 6 ounces of water and 26 ounces of air means that the times can only get better, the fuller the machine is.  Wow...  -Ben Salinas  EDIT:  I reheated the unsealed bottle, and it was almost down to the second: 1:24!

      Well, I ran into one more problem before I was able to start.  My bottle will not fit standing up in the microwave.  Since I have a narrow mouth bottle, I was able to put water in it and place it on its side in the microwave.  This only allows me to put in at most, about 8 ounces of water in the 32 ounce container.  I ended up putting 6 ounces of water in.  This will probably produce little to no change.  There will be very little (comparatively) heat gained by heating up the water.  I am noticing a definite loss of pressure in the bottle, as I am now able to squeeze the lexan bottle and have it compress.   Hmm, I hope the water will boil faster.  I should like to try this experiment with more water.  I will let you know how it ends up, once the bottle cools down.  -Ben Salinas

      I recieved a reply from Nalgene (just over 12 hours after I sent my question).  They pretty much gave me the go ahead.  His actual message was:  Dear Ben Thank you for your interest in our Nalgene Brand outdoor bottles.  In response to your inquiry, the maximum use temperature of both the closure and bottle is 135 degrees Celsius and can be used in a microwave.  It should not be a problem to boil water in it in the microwave.  However I do not have any pressure ratings on the bottle. If you have any additional questions or concerns please feel free to contact me directly at xxxxxxx@nalgenunc.com  Sincerely Jim Havens  I shall go and conduct this experiment.  Pray for the best  -Ben Salinas

      With the help of google, I have figured out a method to create a low pressure system in a bottle with little to no work.  This is to heat up an open container of water and then seal the container.  Once this is done, we let the bottle and its contents cool down.  By the gas law (pv=nrt), if volume is held constant, and temperature is decreased, the pressure will decrease.  Thus, we have a low pressure system above the water.  The question is, how much lower will the pressure be.  I guess that one way of testing this would be to heat up the water, and then put a filled balloon over the lid.  Once the bottle cools, the balloon should have deflated.  There should be a way to measure the pressure in the balloon before, and the pressure after.  With this method, we could test the change in pressure within our budget (Which is currently $0).  Once we get back to school, we should have more access to equipment, and maybe even a pressure guage!  Now, once this sealed bottle has cooled, we can stick it back into the microwave (sealed this time), or stick it onto a stove and heat it up.  We can time it until the water boils, and this time should be less than when the bottle is at atmospheric pressure.  Hopefully it will be significantly less.  Now, our next problem: What type of bottle will withstand losing pressure (without changing volume) and withstand being heated to boiling temperature.  I first thought of my  urlLink 32 Ounce Lexan Narrow Mouth Nalgene Bottle  . This bottle can take all sorts of abuse.  It can easily hold boiling water, be dropped from 30 feet onto rocks, and even take my abuse.  My one worry is the lid.  I don't know if the lid can stand being heated for long periods of time in the microwave.  I really don't want to destroy the lid (or my microwave).  Alternatively I could use a jar of some sort, but all the jars I have use metal lids.  I think I will e-mail Nalgene and ask them if their lids are microwave safe, after explaining our project.  I will let you know how it goes.  -Ben Salinas

      Next on our list is making sure that our idea (or that the idea that our whole project rests on) works.  Now, I know that when pressure is lowered, the boiling point is lowered, but I have relatively little to no idea by how much it is lowered.  Well, after a bit of research I know more.  Apparently, the temperature at which water boils on top of Mount Everest is about 150 degrees F.  The pressure at that point is 30 kPa.  Pressure at sea level is 101 kPa.  So, in order to be able to use only solar energy to boil water (we are talking pure water here, not salt water), we would need to produce a pressure near (or below) 20 kPa (this is just a guess on my part... it might be lower).  Now, if we were to use other sources of heat (wood burning), we could get by with 30 kPa, or higher.  My question is, how hard is it to get a pressure of that magnitude.  I really have no idea.  I know how easy it is to add pressure.  For example bike tires are inflated to a pressure between 300 and 500 kPa.  I would suspect that in a rigid container, it would require the same amount of work to remove pressure as it does to add pressure (according to the physics equations, it should be about the same), so in theory, we should be able to produce near vaccuum like conditions (maybe sub 10 kPa) fairly easily.  I will continue looking up information on this to see if I can take the abstract idea of 10kPa and compare it to something more concrete.  Once we get back into school, we should start working on some proof of concept experiments.  I envision pumping air out of a rigid container (maybe something made out of glass) partially filled with water.  Once the air has been pumped out, we will test for either the time it takes the water to boil, or the temperature at which the water boils.  The hard part will be to create the low pressure system in a classroom situation.  Maybe we will machine a part to get a tight seal and use a hanheld pump.  We shall see.  -Ben Salinas

      Yesterday (more specifically, this morning), I left you with the question "What is our project?"  It is now time to answer that.  First off, what is our problem?     Water is one of the most abundant resources on earth, and clean water is vital for the survival of humans.  It is so important that the United Nations has gone as far as declaring that access to clean water is a right.  And yet, even with an abundance of water, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reports that “Some 1.1 billion people – one sixth of the world's population – do not have access to safe water.”  This is a problem that needs to be addressed.     According to UNICEF, there is a need for inexpensive and efficient water purification methods.  The Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), which is a combined research effort of UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), has gathered data showing that in the least developed countries, 62% of the population has access to water, but only 44% of the population has access to sanitary water. According to UNICEF, each year about 3.4 million people die from unsanitary water conditions.  In fact, the WHO reports that, “Every eight seconds a child dies of a water-related disease.”          Although there are many current solutions for providing sanitary water in developing nations, none of them are able to improve the current situation by a significant amount.  According to the JMP, from 1990 to 2000, the percentage of the population with access to sanitary water has only increased by 3%.    Current solutions are developed to provide sanitary water on a large scale, thus consuming large amounts of resources and energy.  Typically, these solutions rely on filters or chemicals.  Although these solutions require minimal initial cost investment, they require continuous maintenance costs, as well as people instructed to maintain them.  Furthermore, it is difficult to determine the lifespan of these chemicals and filters.  According to Waterwise, a large water filter and chemical manufacturer and distributor, replacing the filters and adding chemicals at the correct time is pertinent to providing sanitary water.  If a filter is used too long, then water run through the purifier will be contaminated without any indication.       Many current solutions also require high levels of power, typically gathered from diesel or propane.  This is another resource, which must be replenished in order to operate the purifier.  In addition, there is not only a high cost for the fuel itself, but also for the shipment of the fuel to the remote locations of the purifiers.  Essentially these purification systems require just as much outside intervention to upkeep the system as it does to install them.  Despite the high maintenance of the current solutions, they are used because they provide clean water at a relatively low cost per liter.  A solution that provides water at the same or lower cost per liter while requiring less maintenance and outside supplies would be preferable.     So, we have a problem.  We also have a proposal for a solution.  This is to make a more-efficient, equally cheap method of water purification which requires little to no consumable supplies.  Our current solution is to use solar energy to evaporate water and then condense it, thus giving us totally pure water.   This solution brings us to another problem.  Anyone who has been outside, even in the Rio Grande Valley, knows that water will not boil in a resonable amount of time from the sun alone.  Our proposal also deals with this issue. In order to boil water at a lower temperature, we plan to create a low pressure system above the water.  This will reduce the boiling temperature of the water, thus making it actually possible to boil water with energy from the sun only.  In addition to using solar energy, our solution would also be able to recieve heat from fire or other sources of heat.  What do we do next?  Our plan of action from here is to solidify our idea by conducting some proof of concept experiments.  These will involve lowering the pressure in a container of water, and measuring the boiling temperature.  From there, we will have to determine whether our method of lowering pressure is viable and whether we will be able to get a low enough temperature.  If we can, then we will work on a design.  If not, it is back to the drawing board.   That's all for now -Ben Salinas

      This blog is the future home of our Engineering Design and Development (EDD) project discussion.    Allow me to introduce myself.  I am Ben Salinas and am a senior at  urlLink The Science Academy of South Texas .  I, along with Baldo Vela and Steven Kroman, will be working on this project.  Our proposal and how it started:  About 9 months ago, I found the link to a grant opportunity for high school students from MIT known as  urlLink MIT InvenTeams  .  This was a $10,000 grant given to a team of high school students to invent something.  I was immediately intrigued and showed the link to Baldo and Steven.  We started discussing our ideas, and came up with a crude solution to a problem (or at least what we thought of as a problem).  We discussed our proposal with Mr. Mark Schroll, a teacher at our school, and he told us what we would need to do (essentially, prove that we had a problem before we invented a solution). We went off and did just that.   When the application for the grant was released in the spring, we had a head start on everyone else.  The spring application is supposed to be for the teacher to propose a possible idea, with no idea of a team in his mind.  We already had a team, and a possible idea. Not only did we have an idea, but we also had a solution to a proved problem.  We sent in our proposal and waited.  In July, we learned that we had not made the first cutoff in the grant application process.  We were obviously disappointed, but Baldo, Steven and I decided that we wanted to go on with our project. That brings us to today.  What is this project you might ask?  Stay tuned for more information.  -Ben Salinas
