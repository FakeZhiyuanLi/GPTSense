      It's down to this  I've got to make this life make sense  Can anyone tell what I've done  I missed the life  I missed the colours of the world  Can anyone tell where I am   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun again  Away from the sun again   I'm over this  I'm tired of living in the dark  Can anyone see me down here  The feeling's gone  There's nothing left to lift me up  Back into the world I've known   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun  That shines the life away from me  To find my way back into the arms  That care about the ones like me  I'm so far down, away from the sun again   It's down to this  I've got to make this life make sense  And now I can't do what I've done   And now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines the life away from me   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun  That shines the life away from me  To find my way back into the arms  That care about the ones like me  I'm so far down, away from the sun again

        Ok I haven't done this in a long time, and I think it is time to start again. There are so many things that have been going on and a lot that I have been keeping in to my self.      First off a little about me. I am 26 yrs old. I have been married for 3 years to my husband Chip, but have been with him for 7 and a half years. We have 3 kids together. Adam who is 6, Josh who is 3 and Kaylee who is 2. Our kids have a lot of issues. They don't listen most of the time. And don't stay out of anything. Chip doesn't have much patients with them. He's always getting mad at them for something. I don't either half the time. I am constantly yelling at them because they don't listen to me. I tell them to do something, and they don't, and I end up telling them 10 times or more. I get so frustrated. Then there is Chip and I. We are not as close as we use to be. To many things have happened between us, and its just hard anymore. I am afraid to get close with him because everything I seem to feel we are doing good or making some kind of progress life gets fucked up.      Chip has cheated on me 3 times that I know about. The first time the only reason I found out about it was because she ended up pregnant, and has a son that is 3 months older than Josh. The second time I found out about it and confronted him, and he moved out. I was 8 months pregnant with Josh. And then the 3ed time was just last year. I actually caught him with the bitch. And he moved out for a while. We never really dealt with all of this. Everything I wanted to talk to him about it he would tell me that he wasn't ready to talk. Finally I gave up and stopped bothering him about it. But I know that is a lot of the problems that we have with each other. I know he is unhappy being here with me and the kids. He hasn't told me. But I have read his bloc, and he has stated this many times. I don't know what I can do to make him feel different. But I know I cant. For the fact that I don't know if I am happy with my life. Don't get me wrong. I love him more than life its self, as well as the kids. But I am unhappy with the way things are at home. I hate going to work and then coming home and having to do everything. I have to make dinner, take care of the kids, clean the house, do the laundry, and anything else that needs to be done. I have been doing this for so long, and with no help. Until it gets to the point that it absolutely has to be done he doesn't do anything. I have given up on cleaning the house. I am tired of doing it and then 5 mins later it is trashed again. And I ask anyone to help me I become a bitch. I cant even get him to take the trash out once a week when it is trash day. I don't know. I'm just tired of feeling like the maid rather than a wife and a mother. Once I am done with what I do at work and home, I am exhausted at night. I cant stay up like Chip does. He sits on the computer all day and half the night, and when he comes to bed I am already asleep. I have tried before to get his attention, but it gets so old trying to compete with all his friends on the internet. And I have told him this before. But he doesn't see it as an issue. I know the computer is a major part of his life, and I excepted that when I married him. The one thing that I know is that the kids are seeing the way he is, and they see that it is ok to not help do anything.   I just don't know what to do or think anymore. One minute things are great and the next the worst life in the world.  Anyway, I'm not to sure about a lot of things in my life at this point. I want to make things better between me and my husband and with the kids. But I don't know where to start anymore. I feel like why should I try when no one else wants to anymore. I have tried so many times to make things the best for us. And I have always been repaid with him cheating on me. Finding someone better for the time being. And then he comes back to me like nothing ever happened. I guess I am just tired of feeling like a rag doll getting tossed aside when ever he feels like. I wish I could tell him all of this. Maybe in time I will.     I didn't mean to make this a bitch session. I just have been a little frustrated lately.      I do love my family, my husband and my kids. Its just me that I don't love. I honestly hate myself. My looks, my attitude, my weight. Everything about me. So how then can I expect anyone to love me?
