      yo yo...ok i am bored. thank god the comp was fixed today...i went into ITP to watch mom do two evals on two very interesting, very disabled kids...i am such a dork for this stuff!!! so by the time i got home around lunch, dad had been on the phone with comcast and gateway to try and figure out what the deal was with the comp...and luckily they were successful, and it's been fine ever since! i even managed to finally sift through and delete all my extraneous music on the comp, and consolidate into one folder. got my new version of winamp, and it's smooth sailing!  been mostly OP today, minus a dorito attack, extra rice at dinner, and some wine right now...oh well, sue me, it's my TOM and i want to, lol.  tomorrow is this stupid cta crap that i don't want to do, and if my mother weren't the pres, i woudln't have accepted the job, grrr...oh well, at least the following day is HH, and then it's friday, then sundee's wedding!  haven't called adam yet...think i am going to on thursday afternoon to invite him to HH and see what vibe i get then...eh i don't know, i am so messed up in the head about guys! damn you ashley and billy wherever you are! "let not fear make strangers of those who should be lovers"--- easier said than done  another funny quote to remember from today "life is a sexually transmitted disease" lol at least i laughed, niki didn't really get it, go figure ms. planned parenthood! lol

      i am excited! we got high speed comcast internet and digital cable today! the tv stuff is nice of course, but the internet part is the great part!!!! so this also means that the old ass comp got put upstairs in "dad's" room, and my elon comp got hooked up downstairs as the family computer until leslie gets a comp for school in the fall! holler! it is quite exciting i must say...  so i am getting back OP this week after having three days off program. friday we were out as usual, and i saw adam the hippie surfer man again... :) it was weird, but cute and again i said no to going back to his place to hang out with him, but said i might call him this week to see if he wanted to hang out...mehhhh, so now i don't know if i actually want to follow through with that or not...hmmm... if he said yes, i wouldn't know what to do with myself on a 'date'...i'd invite him to happy hour if i wasn't afraid niki and kim would act totally like idiots...well niki mostly.  sundee's bachelorette party was on sat night, and despite initially almost bailing out on the plans, i went and had lots more fun than anticipated! if it weren't for niki (again) acting like a total idiot, it would have been perfect...i don't know but i think that she and i may be on our way to a pretty nasty confrontation if she doesn't get over herself pretty soon...argh.  so now i am hoping to make posting a regular habit on here, when i don't journal on paper as i used to...we'll see how that goes, but cheers to comcast! holler~

      haven't written since I started, but I've been posting in my WW journal. it was the kids' last day today until July, so it's nice and quiet in here now and we are getting moved/packed...the teacher down the hall who is moving in here is like pushing us out as she brings more stuff in...oh well, not my issue. I've been feeling really good since starting WW...i'm in the beginning of my third week now, and have dropped five lbs so far! and this is the week before my period too, so my weight is usually up right now, not down...so i am excited to see a truer/not bloated weight the week following my period...i guess i just feel really good knowing that i am doing something that is good for me, makes me feel better inside and out! (this is WAY not normal for me! lol) we're waiting for stephanie to come back so we know what the heck we should be doing until three when we can leave... going out for mom's bday today, carrols' creek? never been there, but mom said i should be able to make a decent food choice there, fish or chicken or something...but i do have 16 points left for today, so i am in good shape!!! yay! go me! discovered a new cd yesterday, jaime callum...LOVE IT! makes me happy to find good shit like that! holler!

      so I read about this online, and decided to give it a try, in addition to my WW journal...dealing mostly with food stuff. I've been trying to restart journaling for some time now, and wanted to check it out online to see what's up. So let's see if this posts, and here goes!
