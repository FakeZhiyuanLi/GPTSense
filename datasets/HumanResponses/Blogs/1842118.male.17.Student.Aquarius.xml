       I wish somebody around my house who knows how to cook would. I haven't had real food at home for 2 weeks. So today I finally started to crack, and I needed something to eat at 9:30 pm. Then I got an idea that I could go to McDonald's and get Sundays for my family (we have coupons) and then buy a burger for myself. Brilliant I thought, despite it being nasty food, its my best chance. So off I went to McD's, and go figure, I meet somebody who honestly surprises that anybody would hire this person. We got past the four Sundays real easy, but then the fun started:  Me: "... and a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese sandwich, not a meal." McD: (searches cash register for that button) " uhh, what number is that?" Me: "It's a three, but I only want the sandwich." McD: "Ok." (presses button)  So then I notice that the price is for that of the single, not the double. Arg.  Me: "Is that the double or just the single?" McD: (Turns around and ask the manager in spanish is it's correct, corrects to the right sandwich)  Wow, and I thought I had it tough with the people I work with.  Hey, at the sandwich tasted ok and I'm still alive.

       Last night I decided that for the first time in two week I was going to go visit Matt, since I'm usually there about twice a week. Night started off fairly boring, but then we found some C rocket engines. Sadly, we had no launch device so we tried to build our own. First we made small fires but they never got close enough to the rocket, so then we moved on to candles, but it was then that we learned you needed more than a small fire to light it. Matt then came up with the idea that we should use some gasoline, which we decided would probably work. We then went on a hunt to find some, and then Matt poured it on to the rocket, and while I wasn't watching he started making a line so that we could light that. It was my plan just to throw some burning paper at it and let it take over from there, but Matt really wanted to light it on that line, so he took the burning paper and started waving it around the ground to find that line again, and suddenly it all went up in flames. Looked cool, probably not the best idea. However, much to our disappointment the rocket refused to light, so we put out the fire and played video games.     Next morning: Usually in the morning I'm the first awake, and Matt usually sleeps until I leave, but today he was up first. So to get he revenge on me for previous attempts to wake him, he did as I once had and used the WetJet Swiffer to spray that soapy stuff all over my face, which instantly woke me up, but I kept still and made sure my mouth was shut. I then waited until he was close enough (I could hear him moving) and grabbed him and tried to get a headlock, which didn't work perfectly, but better then most tries. Matt then realized that I'm not a nice person to wake up.     Finally, I got home an hour later and I have to say that I really like being home. Everything is clean, no pets, I have a computer that actually works, and I have my music.

       Isn't summer supposed to be all relaxing and nice for k-12 students? It's definitely not like that for me. Besides working 20+ hour weeks, I get stuck with studying for school, which isn't all that bad since it is programming, but I also have to do some reading and service hours for school. I also have the joy of driving my four younger siblings all around town to help them keep their lives nice and busy. Today was the first day in two weeks that I've seen my girlfriend, or any of my friends for that matter.     I need a vacation.

       What is work? This is how I described it today:     Work is when old people steal 6.2% of you paycheck, 9.06% is taken to fund criminals (aka, politicians), and 1.45% keeps you from sueing your boss (healthcare). That's work. Oh, and don't forget that 7% of what you have after that goes to those criminals again.   Yea, that's work.

       So I took two IQ test earlier today and scored 147 on the first ( urlLink link ) and 133 on the second ( urlLink link ). The second IQ test also rated me as a numerical logician. Here's what they have to say about that:   Numerical Logicans have very strong spatial abilities and can easily understand things on a complex, abstract level.   Then they told me that only 6 in 1000 people are of that type. Cool is what your supposed to think, I'm special, but being a number person I did the quick math. First off, they choose what type of thinker you are by your top three of eight sections. Then it's easy to use combinations and find that there are 56 diffent types, and 1000/56 is ~18. From that it's easy to believe that my number is below average since not many people like math.    It took somebody with a PhD to come up with that little idea, and my high school mind was able to destroy its purpose. I think I'll let my ego run free at work today.

       Wow, after looking at last nights post I must have been in a really bad mood. Oh well, Moore deserves it, but I'm not in a political mood right now. Today I got the chance to sleep in, which was very enjoyable. After some regular internet stuff (news, email, etc) I got back to my java book, which is fairly interesting. I'm learning about the basics of internet connection through java, and I have to admit that it seems a lot easier that I would have thought.     I think that once I get through this book I'll begin with a calender sort of program. None of the extra stuff, just what I need, and then I'll try and extend it with internet access so I can look at my calender from any computer. That seems like a reasonable project idea, which brings me to my next thought.    Since I started learning java there has been one thing that really bugs me. Everything that I need for more my computer is in one way or another already made, and for that matter made much better than I'll be able to anytime in the next few years. My calender idea I like because I'm yet to find a nice calender app that I'm willing to use. Another project I might do sometime is to help out my dad's small business with writting a database application to manage all their customers and what not, but it will be a while before I'm capable of that level of coding. Maybe next summer.

       I've noticed that over the last year I have become increasingly interested in politics. The main reason for my interest is the fact that in 6 months I'll be 18 and they'll have that much more control over my life, but also I have started working this summer and when somebody takes 15% of my paycheck I start to wonder what's happening with it.    So, to skip the fluff, I'm conservative on most issues, but I also have strong libertarian side. To get into the details would take me hours of writting and fill many pages, which quite frankly, I don't feel like doing. However, what sparked me today was Bill O'Reilly's interview with Michael Moore. After seeing that debate I felt so sick that any person could be so stupid. Harsh to say, but honestly, if he can make at least $10 million for himself off of one movie, he has to be more intelligent than he appeared. For example, he asked O'Reilly if he would give his child's life for the war. O'Reilly said he would give his own, but refused to say he would give his child's. Thank god, that stupid fat guy thinks that parents actually just put their kids in boxes and send them off to war. As of yet, there is no draft, and every person in the military is there by choice. (and for those who say they are there for the college, then you can blaim the democrates for them being their since Ted Kennady is so proud of democates introducing the GI Bill)     I'd like to see Moore put his life on the line for his country, or even just say he would.    Update: Look at Moore's webpage, he has to tell his readers to put on protective goggles when watching O'Reilly's interview because you know, they might actually see some truth for once.

       I spent some serious time today updating, installing, and cleaning my computer. I started off by completly portioning all my bookmarks into folders (my favorites file in firefox is over 50kb of xml goodness) and then I completly uninstalled and reinstalled my firefox extensions (they had been giving me some problems since I reinstalled a few days ago with firefox crashed on me). After my fun doing all this and playing with some of the new extensions (One really nice one, Tabbrowser Preferences 0.6.5, has made surfing much cleaner), I had to go to work, which, like always, was really boring. However, I decided it's time to get an rss reader and play with the idea, so I got feedreader which is looking nice so far. Sadly, my dad's making go to bed now 'cause I have to wake up tomorrow to go report my discovers on the cash register to my uncle who works for my dad.

       If google is able to get amazing programmers like Bloch ( urlLink link ) then I don't think it will be long until they will be able to start picking off programmers from Microsoft, which in my opinion would be very cool since they are the backbone of Microsoft. I think the time has come that microsoft back off some. Microsoft played a vital role in setting standards for the computer world, but now they are getting too powerful. Along with GNU/Linux becoming easier to use all the time, it might not be too long until Windows is replaced as the leading os.    That will be cool.

       It's amazing what music can do to somebody. I use to never listen to music, until I discovered ocremix.com which I now listen to for a few hours everyday. I don't know what it is, but there is something about music, any music, that takes the stress away. Even Rammstein can relax me when I'm in a bad mood. Admitedly, I don't like rap, but when I actually listen to it (which there isn't much to listen to) it's nice just to hear the (minimal) music involved.     It's fun to watch myself change over the years.

       Like the rest of the world, living in my house is living in the middle of many problems. I could tell many stories, and maybe someday I will, but here is todays.    Knowing that today is my day off from work, (being the only day that the store is closed) I decided that when my dad said he would be doing paperwork I would help him some. I had no clue what I was getting myself into. After we finished the normal stuff, my dad went on to describe some problems that had been around for a while that were affecting the cash registers that we use in our stores. So, me being the most technical person in the house, I was nominated to spend about three or four hours trying to replicate the problem in a controlled enviroment so that it would possible to pinpoint the error and pass the information to the programmer and have him fix it.  So I found at least one problem, and I have to say, that programmer was not the brightest guy. I mean the code for this must be really poorly written so that when you tell it not to ring up and order, it adds it to the day's records anyways.    I think I'll go back to reading about java now.

       I envy those who instantly know early in high school what they are good at, what they can show off. I think about what I like and what I do everyday, yet I don't know. I can't figure it out. I try different hobbies, and I try them again. I read about what others do, and I search for something I can do. To be honest, nothing is really fun to me. I don't like video games or tv, I'm yet to find a sport I like (except casual dodgeball in phys ed, and no, I havn't seen the movie) . For now all I have is my computer and the internet, which I explore so much of, yet I'm still a stranger to almost all of the web. I'll just have to keep hunting.    I have to say, following the white rabbit just ain't that easy.

       Yea, I'm a geek. Computers are my hobby. I think it's vital that people understand at least the basics of computers simply because of their importance in our everyday lives. For a couple years I programmed in basic for my TI-83 calculator, and I was able to create some interesting programs that pushed the language. However, that made me realize that I needed to move on to bigger and better areas. I studied Z80 Assembly for a while on my own, and even wrote a simple program on my own, but I realized that even with the power of assembly the calculator was a far to limited platform. I was determined that I would learn to program for computers. Which language, and how I didn't know, but I would. So I looked into my high school's Computer Science Department (actually it's math department, they only have 2 cs classes) and talked to the teacher of computer science. I learned that they used java, so I set out to learn it, and even better, I was able to convince my dad to buy me "Big Java" which has helped make learning java on my own so far much easier. Now I've managed to learn everything I need to know to get into AP CS, and a bit more. To all non-programmers, you should try it, if at least only to understand a bit more about what keeps society as it is today.

       I know why I'm posting to this blog. I have a need, a desire, to focus my life on what is important to me and prepare myself mentally and physically for the next few years. By putting my thoughts into words, telling the internet my plans, and posting my achivements I can study myself, and watch what happens to me, and change myself. I will change myself, and I hope this can help.

       Recently I've given up drinking caffenine filled goodies (Mountain Dew and Coke-Cola) for multiple reasons,  but mainly just to be healthy. After having been addicted on and off for 3 years, this is tough. I always feel like falling asleep, even while standing, and I'm tempted to just move my cup 3 inches from the sprite do the coke on the fountain drink machine. Oh well, it shouldn't be to bad.

       Well, actually 4 little stuffed monkeys. What a fun little gift.    This is my blog,  a place for me to type and let the world see.    Nothing special yet, maybe I'll find something interesting.    I'd tell you about me, but that's what my profile is for.    We now return you to your previously scheduled internet viewing.

       Wow, summer vacation has never been so busy. I've been working tons and have been home almost no time the last few days. I decided tonight to spend some time at Matt's house for lack of much anything better to do. The internet had been broken on his mom's computer for a while, but it's finally fixed, the solution was to install XP pro (the guy who fixed it is a relative of Matt's and apparently works with computers). He also got Firefox working, but is yet to discover themes or extensions, apparently he is afraid that they could damage the computer. Oh well.  On the first morning of having my cell phone (I guess thursday) I tryed to set a PIN to keep people from screwing with my phone, but ended up sending my phone into lockdown. Luckly it was easy just to call the service provider and get it fixed. Definatly worried me at first though.  Hmm, time to explore this computer and see how much I could fix it.... To bad Matt thinks I'll crash it (obviously he has never seen my computer which run's super fast and smooth.

       Against my will I recieved my own cell phone today. First off, why would I not want one? My answer is that I don't want to become addicted to talking so much, nor do I want to spend the money. Luckly, the second problem is solved by my parents who bought it because they feel that it unsafe for me to go driving without some form of communication available. Also, being the lucky kid that I am, I got to learn to work the phone, which just happens to be the same model as my mom's and sister's. So then I had to enter the phone book for my mom, sister and myself. After that, I feel really sorry for George Jetson, he has it really tough.

       I wish my family would tell me what's happening. My mom came by my room around 11:15 pm last night and told me I should go to bed. This surprised me because usually they don't mind how late I stay up. Naturally I asked if I had to get up the next morning, to which I got the response that I was going to Kings Island (a roller coaster / theme park) in the morning with the rest of my family. I wish they could at least tell me when I'll be spending a whole day away from the house 'cause some of us (me) have friends and occasionally do things with those friends. The weird part is that my mom (aka, boss) already talked to a manager so that she could fill in for me, but I never even heard about that from work.  Oh well, breakfast time.  urlLink  Some old school fun.

       Today I noticed something interesting. I've actually spent enough time driving around with my arm out my window, which are open since I have no ac in my car, that my left arm is signifcantly more tanned that my right. Girls at work think I should at least put that artifical tan stuff on my right arm to balance it all out, but I think it's to much fun. Like when I get back to school:  Friend: "What did you do this summer" Me: (holds up arms next to each other) "Left-Arm-Tanning" Friend: "wtf?" Me: "Lots of time in my car." Friend: "ohh...."  So it's not the world's best plan, but it will give me a good laugh.

       I was in shock this morning as I woke with haste after only a short rest. I felt unusally aware of things happening around me, which made my shower rather enjoying, but it's disappointing that I have to spend the rest of my day driving my siblings around and then working.  Ok, I'm done being a morning person, I want to go back to bed.

       Tonight was interesting. I decided to play monopoly with my siblings, but my brother being the crybaby he is stopped within 20 minutes. However, after that the game kept going. Againt my two sisters (15 and 11) it was obvious that my 11 year old sister would lose, which she did because of her stratagy to collect the railroads and utilites. At the end she was kinda depressed, but took it better than my brother. Then it came down to just me and my sister (15) and it seemed like she would win since she much better property and more money, but by pure luck I started missing all her property and she hit my land. Then when it was obvious that I had won we kept on playing for another 30 minutes or so while nothing happened, and finally I beat her with some bad luck on her side. Total game time was 3.5 hours, and the most interesting part was that for the first time when I played a board game with my family, I really didn't care that I won.  It's bed time.
