      I can't stop listening to it. And I can't stop tweaking with my web page. Whee! Fun.  And now Bailey has started talking about wagon wheels. Now I want a wagon wheel.  Every day school is getting closer....and that sucks pretty bad.  Now I'm craving cheese. *drools*  John Lennon was a genius. Oh how I admire him.

      Drinking may be fun. It isn't horrible and I'm not offended utterly by it. I'm not anti-alcohol or anything, I just don't really see the point of doing it all the time at parties. I'm talking parties, like with everyone from all over.  I just think it's gay. If a person needs alcohol to have fun, I just can't understand that.

      Parties are gay and they suck. It's not like they get together and drink and tell jokes and be funny all night. They drink and act like fags and jerks because while they are drunk they do stupid things that they seem to think are funny. Yes, stupid things are funny, but not that kind of stupid.

      Listening: Franco Unamerican By NOFX  So, I read over the posts made by bailey and shannon. But i would have to disagree with shannon on somethings, to an extent. You see, myself i have drank 2 times, and i do plan on doing it again. I dont do it for the popularity reason, but for the reason of feeling good, and being stupid with others. But people who do party everyday, get drunk all the time, do drugs all the time, are simply pathedic. I dont see a point in doing it. Its a waste of time. But it's their time that they are wasting, not ours( we can do that ourselves)They are ruining there lifes (Not ours). But if you just drink once in a while, i dont see the harm in it. And drinking by yourself is no fun. Its funner with other people. And i dont know if i should being saying this, but i do go church, and looking back to it, i have seen god slowly do odd things in my life, and in my family, through rough times. And i guess i am going throught this "stage" were i want to expierence things. But im not going to regret it, because im not going to go overboard. But i will talk about my opinion church and what not some other time.  Hannah  ( I bought the best pins. let me explain. On has George Bush, and it says MORON across it. (Yes i do not like him), then one with elvis and it says DEAD across it, and the other says "CNN telling lies since 1980. wicked? yes i know)

      I can understand shannon's point of veiw with the whole drinking and drugs thing, but i would just like to say that partying isn't just about drinking, doing drugs and sex.  People COULD do it at home by themselves, but that kind of defeats the purpose, which is the whole social aspect.  Drinking lowers your inhibitions, making you seem more confident, fun and easy going, so people are more open, and do stupid things.  So people get together and get drunk because then they can be loud and do stupid things together, because it's just not as much fun when you are alone.  So that's why people go to parties.  And if you don't want to go to parties yourself, then why does it matter if people do it at home or at someone else's house, you don't have to see it or be around it either way if you don't want to, so who cares.  I'm not saying that it's ok to get all addicted and throw your life away, but if you're going to do it anyway, then why not do it together at a party?

       Listening to:  Depeche Mode - Relax  Well, I'm sitting here, working on my page, oh what a surprise. It's actually coming along rather well, and it makes me happy.  So does New Wave.  It's so cool. Frankie says : Relax. God, now I'm getting all re-obsessed with 80's  New Wave.  Shannno no, you've done this before. All well. I give in.  I read over Bailey's post and agree. I too am neither anti-alcohol or sex. It happens, woo hoo. But for the love of Satan, why can't they do it at home? Personally, I don't think alcohol is the coolest thing in the world.  It's not horrible, but I just wouldn't go and get drunk all the time just to make myself feel all tingly and dazed and stupid. But hey.  If you want to get drunk, go for it.  I just don't understand why people throw their lives away. They just get hooked and they don't understand what it can do to you. I myself think drugs are retarded. So retarded.  No offense to Bailey or Hannah or anyone who is partial to drugs or alcohol, but I just don't see the point.  Anyways, enough with that weird rant. I just spilled coke all over my nicely free whit shirt. Darn. I should never wear white. It was quite funny actually, I slopped down my coke on the end table and it managed to soar out of the can and onto my shirt. Hmm...very odd. Maybe one day I will find an explanation to it.  Well, I had better be off. Just remember what Frankie says:  Relax

      Today is a new day. The second day of the Death to Orange blog. What to write? Probably just more shit.  My power went out because my mom did something weird with a power saw and screwed up a bunch of fuses. Yes, a power saw. I am not too sure what she was up to and I'm kind of scared to find out. The power came back on about an hour ago so I guess it's all good. At least I have my computer back.  I decided to clean the house because I need money to buy my mother a birthday present. As I was cleaning  the kitchen I came across a half digested, decomposing sock on the counter. Yes, on the counter. What could be more repulsive? Think of the bacteria! It turned out to be my mothers sock. If I put socks that looked like that, well make that any socks at all, on the counter my mother would have got out that fuse blowing power saw and chopped me into bits with it.  I just read Shannons post about all the damn party/sex/drugs/alcohol people and I agree. It is rather moronic the way these people slowly kill them selves with herpes and other such sexually transmitted diseases through sex and drug use. But it's their choice. As long as I don't do it, or at least do it safely, I could care less about all the stupid bimbos out there. I'm not saying I'm all anti-drugs and drinking and such. I'm just saying the least they could do is be smart about it. Must you get pissed, do something stupid and pass out on the street much like the guy under cassandra's car? No. Thats just stupidity. I guess stupidity is a large part of most peoples lives these days.  Now that I'm done ranting and bitching I should probably go eat, I didn't get a chance to eat supper due to the fact that my mother was screwing around with the damn power saw.

       Listening to:  The Who - My Generation  As I sit here, doing nothing, I am dreading what is to begin next year. I read over Hannah's post, and was shocked at the similarities between people whom we hate. I have another one to add to my list though: the druggie/alcoholic/woo yeah party people. In my opinion, parties are pointless. Not birthday parties of course, but PARTY parties. Yeah dude let's go get drunk and have sex. What the hell? How much more useless can it get. You can do that within the safety of your own home. Ryan is so lucky. But he said people always ask him "Hey what about parties? How are you going to go to those?". Dear Lord, what a world we live in if the highlight of people's lives is to get drunk.  Haha! I just read in the newspaper (yes, the newspaper) about how people are changing their opinions on George Bush's decision to bomb the shit out of Iraq. Ha! Take that stupid moron! Your people don't love you anymore! I don't see how they ever did, but I guess sometimes Americans can be blinded by their own niavete. Niavette? Spelling?  The classes I am actually looking forward to are Humanities and VisCom. That's about it. Some others might be alright, but those will definitley be THE BEST. The good thing is, Humanities won't be filled with a bunch of stupid bimbos because they are all too illiterate to get into the class. Wheee! We sound like an angry bunch of people. Because we are. Anger makes the world go round!  For some reason, that reminded me...Bailey: "Ah Vicky you were really close with that Arkan-sass one."  Bwaha! That was too damn funny.  "ZOCH!"  Anyways, I  better be off...for now. I shall return.  -Shannon

      I have just been invited into this blog. Oh boy. What to say. I also have another blog. More of deep personal one. Hmm... yes school is starting soon. Seeing how i am a bitter person i probably will hate all the annoying bitchy prepy people. The sluts. the guys who think they are all that, and go for the prepy bitchy people. What a society we live in?. Its far to complicated, and im sure one could not fully understand it. Oh The Last Kiss by A.F.I is playing on my playlist. Its beautiful. "And this is the art of love". Love who needs it? Well i guess we all need love. See i am bitter? but i love bailey and shannon, and thats all that matters. Im just sick of seeing people walking down the mall making out. its digusting. this one couple was groping eachother. who really needs to see that? Oh yes i work at the mall. And make fun of people. And then hats get stolen. Wow this pretty random. Dont worry random is good. And so are panties. yumm... Hannah  A little note * I feel very special being invited into this blog.

      I am in a La La land feeling that the next few days can either be a journey to freedom or an oasis before entering a darker and more physically threatening Hell. Am I excited for school and that sort of getting older freedom that comes with it? Or am I dreading it and the bitchy people, bitchy teachers and shitty homework? I think it's a little of both. I am quite excited about the whole social acpect of school but I really, really would rather not have to work. What about sleeping in? I will have to get up at 5 in the goddamn morning to get a ride into town. This year I will have to take the bus due to the fact I will no longer be going to a school close to Brendens which destroys my chance of hitching a ride with him. I guess thats life and life sucks. Most of the time anyways.  -Bailey-

      I get the feeling Bailey isn't completely getting what I am trying to teach her. The BASICS of HTML. Yes, Basics. But, I see promise in her...she will triumph. Well, I am sitting here, looking at my fridge, wondering what to blog about. There is nothing running through my brain except for all the screwed up codes, and my eye is starting to tweak.  Well, anyways, I was sitting quite happily, doing particularly nothing, when all of a sudden, from the back of my mind, a giant unpleasant thought errupted. Dear God school starts next week! Prepare for a slow and painful death. Anyways, I have run out of thought. I seem to be trapped in some sort of zombie-like twilight zone. So I'll post later.  -Shannon

      Yes. Good thing we have Shannon here to tell me what to do because I have no idea what in gods name is going on. She sits there babbling about icons and codes just expecting me to know what they are! and then she has the gall to make fun of me when I say I want to curl my hair all 80's style. Pshaw! So here I sit, trying to figure out what codes and icons and affiliates are. I think i'm beginning to understand.  Shannon has just started explaining: "Well you know how on the INTERNET you go to a WEBSITE and they have AFFILLIATES. In other words, contacts and things. Friends of the website if you will. You know how the AFILLIATES have litte icon do hickies. ICONS are buttons which most often have pictures and pretty designs."  Yes, Shannon I understand. That did not make me feel like a retard at all.  Well, now I have just made an icon. Now I have no idea what to do with it. I will just sit and wait for a nice explanation from Shannon. She says she needs my URL. Well at least I know what that is. She is going to put my icon/afilliate/URL/ whatever the hell it may be called onto her website for me. Well how nice of her.  I am going to go fiddle with blog things and see what's what.  -Bailey-
