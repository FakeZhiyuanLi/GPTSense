       today is 12nd of August 2004. there has been alot of changes in the house such as tiles on the ground of kitchen, laundry, right outside of the door. i just wish that there won't be n e more of nonsense after the stupid outside tiling will be done....... please God Sake! i don't want n e more work in the house! mr. Javed doesn't know how to make things work. and look at my dad. he just keeps listening to him. i mean my dad needs to wake up and accept already that Mr. Javed is making a fool out of him!!! come on u know he supposed to understand this by now!!!! think about this! how long does it really take a regular labour who knows how to work with tiles. hardly 1-3 days!!! but mr. javed has taken 1 1/2 week!  i mean wat the hell is he really doing! he absolutely is not working for money,  he is working for fun!  if he was working for money. he would have finished by now! man this is really stupid u know! listen to this! in order to fix a simple dishwasher it took a whole day to Mr. Javed to fix the damn dishwasher. it was fixed by some regular guy who knows how to work it. he would have finished it hardly 30 min or so! but this is really damn stupid u know! wat else.... i think nothing much. life is the same. stupid, boring and it totally sucks! becoz i have nothing to do. i m thinking to join the swimming classes. hopefully i'll do that soon! thatz it for 2day.....
