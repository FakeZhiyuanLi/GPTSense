         La Gioconda, or, the Mona Lisa. Painted by Leonardo DaVinci of the young wife of a merchant. Its painted on a thin sliver of wood, and, is admired by most all people to be considered an extraordinary painting. Her smile is unconsistent with paintings of the period, which makes it stand out. The way the folded hands make a triangle with the body is stunning.   The history of the Mona Lisa is interesting. DaVinci was asked to paint the wife of a merchant, and, it took him over four years to complete it, but, never gave it to the merchant. He took it with him to France, where it traveled from King Francis I. to the Louvre to Napoleon, then back to the Louvre. It was stolen, brought to Italy, sold, and then returned to the Louvre again. In 1956, they attempted an acid procedure on it, which damaged much of the lower half of the painting, but, was saved by many years of restoration. It now sits in the Louvre, unable to leave again.

      Welcome to Noodle Soup. I started a blog, not to long ago, called  urlLink Alphabet Soup . It is a group story writing blog. Well, this is it's newly founded sister blog, Noodle Soup.  The main purpose of this blog? Essay writing. Alot like www.everything2.com . But our goal is improving our writing ablity, whereas their goal is sharing knowledge, and writing really neat stuff. So, obviously you're not going to be reading this blog for good writers.  So, the name.. yeah, I had trouble with that one. My description of it? Alphabet soup, the blog for fictional stories, is a letter soup. You can arrange the letters however you want. The sister blog, which deals with essays, is non-fictional stuff, just a presentation of information. Noodles can be bent and stuff, and presented differently, but they are still the same noodle, the same info.  Wether or not people actually pick up on that, well, that's their problem. If someone has a better title, please tell me.

      Well I was hoping today would be uneventful and boring, but my hopes were soon shattered by a little bunny.  One of my cats was chasing the little fellow around the house. He put a few teeth holes in it's little furry back. I saved the bunny from a slimy toothy doom, and now he's sitting in my old empty rat cage. The poor thing hasn't moved for atleast an hour. I can tell he's alive though. His eyes are wide open, staring down the throat of an imaginary cat.   My grandmother told me to let him out into the wild. I carried him via towel to the front lawn, but he just sat there, looking at the imaginary cat again. She insisted that I just leave him there, but I couldn't do that. I was prepared to do anything to make sure this little insignificant ball of blood and fur and organs breathe another day. I don't know why.  Alot of people save rabbits from death everyday. You'd think they were doing the rabbits a favor. The sad truth is, all living things die for a reason. That reason is called Natural Selection, or Evolution. Now, when we save a rabbit, are we doing the rabbit species a favor, or just the opposite?

      So, i'm an artist. Learning to be an artist, atleast. Hopefully I'll be able to practice long and hard enough to get some somewhat decent art to post. A drawing a day is my rule.  Why art, you ask? Because art is good. Art is creation. I like to create. I want to create people. People that live in worlds of my creation. People with stories of my creation. People with problems of my creations. I want to be the GOD of my own world.   Think about that for a second. If I can create with nothing but pencil and paper, couldn't the creator of me and you have done somthing similar? I'm not saying that I beleive in a god. I'm open to the idea that there may or may not be one, and that we'll probably never find out. What i'm saying is just another possiblity out of the millions of possible possibilities, and by saying it I am acheiving nothing.   So in short: The above three paragraphs have done nothing at all in the advancement of human knowledge, and by writing it I have wasted a good 10 minutes of time I could have spent doing somthing productive. The end.

      So, my mom bought a Vespa. It is pretty and shiny and fast. I'm going to take photos of it, because it's so shiny.  She said I could get one, too. Once I have my license. I'll try to get the Yellow one from FLCL. That would make me a very happy fanboy indeed.  Haven't thought of anything to post lately. So i'm boring you with my Vespa news. The Vespa photos won't be boring though, I promise you that.

      Me, my brother, and my mom, were standing on the side of a road. It was the time of day where everything reflected a strong blue color. I shouted, "This is MY world!" In this dream I represented the color blue.  My brother seemed upset, he represented green. We argued for awhile. I can't remember the specifics. I was trying to calm him down, make him see reason. I pointed to the grass below us. "Look, there is some green there." I pointed across the street at a yellow Bulldozer. "And there is a green sticker on that machine." I pointed to a green roof on a restaurant down the street. "And green there, too." He said, "Hey, I didn't notice those before." We finally agreed.

      Whenever my grandmother catches me reading a book, she'll walk up to me, smile at me, tell me she is proud of me. Whenever she catches me playing a video game, she makes rude comments, often extremely insulting to my entire being, she orders me to do somthing else, and when I don't do exactly as she says, she sighs and slumps away, grumbling under her breath. This is so very wrong.  Sitting on my ass reading a book for 10 hours straight is just the same as sitting on my ass playing a game for 10 hours straight. They are both enriching, wonderful peices of art. But some certain members of my family tend to judge things without any actual contact or study of the actual thing they are judging. They do it alot, and it pisses me off. If I tell them this, they simply shrug it off, and continue to avoid contact with whatever thing they have judged.   There's really not much more to it. Rant mode - Shutdown.

      I was looking for a snack a little while ago, and found a bottle of cheese sauce that had expired a little over 2 years ago, sitting so innocently in that fridge next to everything else i've eaten in the last 2 years. Mmm, cheese.

      I watched Apocalypse Now a couple days ago. Man, what an amazing movie. I'm not really in the mood to write up a big post right now, so just go and watch it. Your jaw will drop at some of the visuals, too. I assure it.

      My room is an awful mess. I have a tiny desk with two monitors, covered in coke cans, a dresser I don't even use, an empty rat cage sitting in the middle of the room, ANOTHER desk covered in junk, and basically a bunch of other furniture I have no use for at all.   My mom doesn't seem to understand the concept of getting rid of junk. Our house is overflowing with furniture we do not need, and do not use, just hogging up space. Whenever I walk into someone elses home, I am simply amazed by how nice and neat and pretty things are.  Now, when I walk into my OWN home, I feel horribly claustrophobic. I wonder if my mom realises how much money she could earn by selling some of our stuff. We have a rather large pool table in our den. You can hardly play without your stick hitting the wall while trying to make a shot. Although this is hardly a problem, seeing as we never use the damn thing anyways, unless a shelf for laundry baskets really counts as using it. We also have a ping pong table, folded up on the deck, because we have no place for it to fit, and, even if we did, we wouldn't use it. I could really go on and on about all the different monstrous peices of useless furniture in my house.  So, anyways, I had a really nice idea today. There is a room next to mine, it's pretty much empty at the moment. I  decided I could connect it to my room with a door way, and make it an extension to my room. Mainly a room for rabbits and rats. I never did have adequate space in my current room to take care of rats. Rats need room to run around, you can't just keep them in their cage. I'd also move into that room my bed. Now, take this, plus a little convincing to my mom to get rid of all the other junk in my room i'm not using, and i'll be able to BREATHE again!  I've wanted to setup a little entertainment center on a single wall of my room. Nothing too big. Just a medium sized TV with some shelves around it, and maybe 2 beanbag chairs. Nothing but that on the wall. Then, on the other side of the room, in a nice open area, i'd place my computer desk. In the other room, a single bed, a 4 foot tall, 2 feet wide, rat tower/cage, a rabbit cage, and all kinds of toys for the rabbit and the rats to enjoy. Mostly just air, though, and that is what is important.   I feel i've ranted quite enough for now. I need to go talk to my mom about getting rid of all our junk now.

      I was hoping to post some comics I had thought of awhile back, and introduce some ideas that kind of went along with the comics, but that would require me drawing decent art, and that just isn't going to happen.  So now I have nothing, other then what I did today, but that isn't very interesting.  So... Today I woke up, went to a party full of people I don't know, came home, picked up a friend and played video games, and now I am here, struggling to make a decent post, and failing.

      Ok, so there is this box, and babies are flying out of it.     The babies crawl outward, each taking a different direction. One of the babies has a mohawk.     After alot of crawling, and alot of growing, the mohawk baby reaches the end of another box. Beyond it's borders is a mystery, he does not know what he is seeing.     He jumps out. Nobody really knows what happens then. Maybe some magical stuff occurs, with pretty colors, and he turns into another baby. (note the different colored mohawk)     Then maybe he's spit out again, from the same box he started from.     I really don't know what the hell i'm doing.  I'm having fun, though.

      I was looking through different chat quotes I had saved and found this:  BuddytheRat08: Opinions are like assholes, everyone has them, and they all stink. [name removed]: Hahahah. BuddytheRat08: Wow.. When dogs smell eachothers asses, it's like they are sharing their opinions and making their judgments on eachother based on that. BuddytheRat08: Just a thought that crossed my mind. o_0 [name removed]: Usually the opinion is either 'I should fuck this dog' or 'I should fight this dog for territory.' [name removed]: Which is also a lot like human interaction. BuddytheRat08: Sad that "civilization" can be dumbed down to that of a dog. [name removed]: We're dogs with opposable thumbs.  I don't know why we get so off on ourselves.

      It's 4:00 AM and what am I doing? Brainstorming. I had an idea a couple hours ago for the game.  Here is what I wrote down:  You play an alien trapped in the deep labrynthine walls of Area 51.  The game is a top-down grid puzzle game, much like "Chip's Challenge", in which you walk through a grid map, finding keys, pushing crates, pulling levers, doing whatever you can to reach the exit of the level, and make it further out of area 51.  The spin: As an alien, you are a little more advanced then Humans. You have psychic powers, which you can use to do a number of tasks, such as flipping an out of reach switch, pushing an out of reach crate, or even controlling a patrol guard, etc.  Now all I need to do is think up each of the puzzle elements, and how they will be made graphically. Not as easy as it sounds.  So, the alien uses telekenesis to solve problems, and thus we need problems to put use to these powers. This is where the real thinking begins, and my creativity is put to the test. Puzzle games are rather difficult to create, as they should be. If they aren't hard to think up, they won't be hard to solve.   And thus I sit, at 4:00 AM, and brainstorm.  Maybe some sleep will make it easier to think. G'night folks.

      I got some good photos from my friend's house. He lives on a farm.  This is his horse, mano. He's a rather old horse, but still sweet as can be. The sky was dark blue from a storm that had recently passed. It was beautiful that day.  urlLink     Last weekend a tornado came through the area. His barn lost it's roof, and is now strewn all over the place. Another barn, not too far away, completely collapsed with a car under it. They managed to get the car out, but they ended up with $3400 worth of car repairs.  urlLink     Here's my friend, in one of his more.. emotional moments. Haha, actually, after telling him that he proceeded by snapping the flower in two, flexing his muscles, and growling.   urlLink     Annd, that's about it for today.

      I just got back from seeing "The Day After Tommorow". It's the first time in awhile that i've gone to see a movie I knew was going to be bad. It was quite awful.  On the drive home, my mom, and my brother discussed the movie. They thought it was kind of stupid too, but they only pointed out the little holes. The small little mishaps. The tiny impossibilities that you always notice in movies like this. But, they let these little holes go off easy. They still enjoyed the movie, in all of it's imperfections.  But, what about the bigger holes? The holes that real critics notice. I noticed some, if not all. For example, all of the pointless suspense added to the film, and all the sappy human-interest episodes to pretty it up and hide the unintresting aspects of the movie.  My mom and brother enjoyed the movie, they said so themselves. In fact, to quote directly from my brother, "It wasn't that bad. It was good for what it was, an armageddon movie." This is a prime example of a shallow persons ability to completely ignore the big picture of things, or, in this case, the big holes.

      [The following post has been rated "Really Boring", for excessive ranting about things you probably don't give a damn about. You have been warned.]  I like making games. Well, trying, atleast. I've never actually finished a game before, only started  alot of projects that were really way too extreme and large for me to actually finish them. I haven't started any new projects in quite awhile, but recently I've had a sudden urge to start it up again. This time i'll take up a strategy in my game planning.  [You don't have to read any of this, I just feel like typing it out. I'm not trying to make this post interesting in any way.l]  So, I've decided to make small pathetic games. No big epic ones. Just for now, atleast. There's something about playing you're own creation that gives you a strong feel of satisfaction in yourself, and when you work on a game for a very long time with nothing to actually play, you get bored with the project. Now, I could take a bunch of side projects, and have a big project that I work on back and forth, but I don't think that's enough. I think I should take on a big project, and instead of getting too ahead of myself in planning, I'll slowly code and create beta versions. Like,  feild with the character in all his animated glory, with all the engine stuff coded.   [Have you really made it this far? Really, you can stop reading.]  Hmm, so, like I said i've taken on alot of projects. I beleive my first big one was...no..or was it...nope. There are too many to even remember. I remember a GTA type game in which you take up missions, in a top down space shooter style, like asteroids. And a "School Simulator". That one was weird, yet I still think it would have been great if I finished it. Basically, you go through the school year, but what made it interesting was it was driven by a very large choice branch system, so, every choice you makes changes the rest of the game. There would be no test taking, grades would be based on your characters additude I suppose, or, possibly, when you arrive home from school you choose a certain ammount of effort to put into studying (and you'd be limited on your choices based on your characters stats) and then that would effect waking up and all that stuff. You can probably begin to see why I never finished this, or anything else I started.   Oh, and the cat RPG. That was a good one. (atleast I think so) You start the game by choosing between to cats, Smokey or Kidd. (I would post pictures but i'm not at my home computer. Maybe i'll edit the post when I get home.) The idea was that Kidd and Smokey (two rather large male cats) were fighting over who was the head cat of the neighborhood. Smokey, the house cat, would obviously start in a house. The gameplay would be as follows, you travel around the RPG style maps, finding various cats. Each cat would request a favor, or an item, or many a thing, in exchange for their alleigence. For instance, at the start of Smokey's quest you would first hafto get your furry ass out of the house. In order to do so you would hafto push some things out of the way, but the only cat with the push skill is Willow. Once finding willow, he would ask you for a favor of somesort, and upon completing whatever task was handed to you, Willow would join your party, and thus, give you access to more areas. I was going to have different areas to get into, thus having each play through of the game different then the last, by having some kind of limit on the cats you get on your team. I really favored replayability.   [Seriously, go do somthing productive.]  The only game I think I've ever really finished was "Poke". I kept "poking" people in the eye on AIM, and felt inspired to make a game, in which you ran around a box area, chasing eyeballs, and then poking them to destroy them, while at the same time running from a giant evil hand, trying to poke you, as well. I only made about 3 levels, but it was fun, and quick. I might not make games THAT simple, but still pretty simple.  I'm hungry now. I can't wait for Travis's parents to get home with seafood.

      I am now entirely convinced that the school system is complete, utter, bullshit.  I have this younger cousin, see? If one were to meet said cousin, within about 3 minutes of shaking his hand, one would now have a strong almost uncontrollable need to shove your foot into his face and break his nose, if you haven't done that already, that is. By being around him in strict moderation I have succesfully created an immunity to resulting in violence.   Recently I was visitng this cousin (along with many other relatives.) for the weekend. I had a good time. The fun, intelligent relatives strongly out numbered this one.  Upon stepping out of the car, my cousin was there to greet me and my brothers. He was next to the car in front of us, a friend was with him. The car radio was booming loudly with "When I move you move! Oooh, just like that!" playing repeatedly.( I'm sure you've heard this awful song on the radio or somthing by accident.) Him and his friend were bobbing their heads up and down, trying to look tough and cool. I sighed and wanted to run right back into the car and drive home myself, knowing what my weekend was holding in store for me.  I was glad I brought 3 books with me, because once I found a nice hiding place i'd spend most of the day sitting and reading. If not for that one minor detail, I don't know  what  would have happened.  I made it back alive, but not without making some sacrifices. He now has a name on AIM, and, also, my screenname. I figured with use of the internet, I could talk some sense into him. I was so horribly wrong.    ause63: hey    whats that one friends name Myself: I'm not giving you her screenname, sorry. ause63: why Myself: Because I'm sure she doesn't want to talk to you. ause63: pleasssssssssssssssssssssssssseeeeeeeee Myself: Sorry, not going to happen. ause63: its anach ause63: ill say nice things you can evan ask her Myself: Sorry, anach isn't it. ause63: i need more people to talk to Myself: So get some friends. Myself: The internet is a large expansive world, lots of people to meet. Myself: Only about 3 or 4 people in my buddylist I know in person. ause63: i,ll will stop bugginyou ause63: dont have any ause63: is she one Myself: No, no she is not. Myself: I think you missed the point. ause63: how did you find her name Myself: When I said, "get some friends" I meant get soem friends. ause63: what Myself: I met her on a webforum. ause63: whats that Myself: It's a large community of people online. ause63: how do you get to one Myself: Through a web browser. ause63: and when is gene going to get back ause63: whats that Myself: Internet Explorer ause63: what Myself: I don't know. ause63: i dont get it Myself: Internet Explorer is an web browser, you use it to browse the web. Myself: You're not very bright, are you? ause63: what enter net sight ause63: .................nam ause63: //...............name ause63: hellow Myself: There are lots of them. ause63: a;sldkgf;aha;sodi;as ause63: give me one Myself: Stop getting impatient when I don't reply within 5 miliseconds of what you say. I'm doing more then one thing you know. ause63: ;aligh;aoeifj;a Myself: www.squidi.net has a forum you might enjoy. They have strict rules on proper grammer and spelling though, so don't waltz in talking with no punctuation. ause63: thats dome Myself: It's a webcomic, like the ones I read. I recommend reading through all the comics starting at the beginning before going into the forum. Myself: On the contrary, that's smart. It keeps the unwanted people away. Myself: Grammar is your friend. ause63: im goning in and wright ;alisdgt;aerhi;aosiertha hahahaha Myself: That's really not very clever or humourous in any way. All you'll acomplish doing that is getting made fun of, and then banned almost immediatley. ause63: still doing it    He asks for a way to get people to talk to online, I supply him with such a way, and he, for some reason, decides to register to the forum just to flood the forum with his random pressing of keys on the keyboard, and it doesn't stop there. Not only is he incapable of making friends in an online environment, but is also incapable of registering to a forum.     ause63: it says im not a member Myself: You hafto register first. Myself: Look near the top of the forum, there should be a link labled "Register" Myself: You need an e-mail to register though. ause63: where        front page Myself: Front page fot he forum. Myself: Stop askign me questions and look for yourself ause63: a;slifha;ewrghio ause63: gene is still not back Myself: He's sleeping. ause63: how come he didnt go off Myself: because he doesn't want to Myself: don't ask pointless questions ause63: uhhhhhhhh whats 2+2? ause63: fjkyulufgkuy ause63: lekjrhlaskejrh ause63: apierunhaopeirah ause63: hey how do we get permision to rply Myself: I told you you hafto register. ause63: i did Myself: And now you hafto click the link in the convermation e-mail sent to the e-mail address you supplied in the register form. Myself: The forum tells you to do this, yet you are here asking me. ause63: it hasnt come yet  Myself: So be patient. ause63: ive wated long Myself: It hasn't been that long. ause63: yep ause63: it has Myself: Too bad then. Myself: If it is too far beyond your mental capacity to register for the forum, maybe you shouldn't be posting there in the first place?    I wonder.. If people like him somehow managed to figure out this complex process, would they, in turn, completely destroy all of the internet as we know it? I tremble in fear at the thought.  But onto the point of all this. Get ready, becasue what you're about to hear will amaze you. My cousin-the one described above-has just gotten out of the 6th grade. Next year, he'll be in the 8th. Whereas I, repeated the 3rd grade, and all through out middle school I fell back on homeschooling because I would cave in on the stress.  This is why the school system is complete, utter, bullshit.

      I've been gone all weekend, thus the lack of new posts, well here's something for you:  The craters of the moon looking alot like the face of a man is a very well known fact, but did you know it's really fun looking past the man, at the other things in those giant holes in the face our nightly visitor?  When my mom first pointed out the man to my brother some time ago, he saw a dragon. Only recently did I notice what he was talking about. It's kind of a deformed dragon though, with an overly large head. What was kind of odd though was I didn't see the man as I remembered him, his face was now in udder fright, instead of the friendly smile I used to see.  Well what my point is, is that maybe we should ask people to say what THEY see in the moon, before bringing up any mention of the man. It'd be funner that way, no?  So that's my post for the day.

      So, my friend created a thread on some forums we both frequent about blogger, hoping to find some other bloggers out there that he could talk to. Then some ass-hole decides to post his lame rant about "why blogger is crap".  So, I decided to step in and send the guy a PM. *stands proudly in front of large blogger logo waving in slow motion.*  "Your opinion on blogger, well, it sucks.  I happen to have a blog of my own, I don't really care for people to read it, but I do try my best to make it interesting for those who might. (http://ratnest.blogspot.com/) Yes, I do eventually post a part about myself and stuff that's been going on in my life, but only when it's important or emotional or whatever. The blog is mainly so I can practice my writing skills, and maybe have a little fun and make new friends with it.    You also seem to think that, if a person knows other people are reading their blog they won't be as free in what they write. That's true for some people, but most of those people really only have a blog so that maybe somebody out there will see their angsty unimportant troubles and feel amazingly sorry for them. They just want attention is all. I mean, I don't doubt for a second that alot of blogs out there suck. But, they aren't obligated to be interesting. In other words: Why are you bashing something that is not doing any harm to anyone?  But what really pissed me off is how you went on and on about how all journals are uninteresting to be read by other people, and then decided to say that you hope someone would read your journal someday, because, it is actually worth reading.  Online or offline, public or private, they both share their drawbacks. To be honest I wouldn't stick with a private blog/journal for more than a week.  It's  kind of like a personal confession booth. My brother reads my blog, and, without that, I wouldn't be as close to him as I am now. I'm an awfully shy person when it comes to talking in person, and especially discussing my problems with other people. Online, though, I lose most of that anxiety. Even more so when writing to my blog.   Now, don't get me wrong when I say, "don't bash things that aren't causing any harm." You're free to not want to create an online journal yourself, but you're going a bit too far, personally bashing us bloggers. Example: "not as if that will stop any of 'u'."   So, in short, I don't like you.   And I  really  appreciate you ruining my friends thread." The thread got locked, because someone said, "Buddha". They have very dumb rule about posting anything relating to religion.

      I read the short story, "Memento Mori" yesterday. I thought i'd share a part I really liked with everyone.  " Here's the truth: People, even regular people, are never just any one person with one set of attributes. It's not that simple. We're all at the mercy of the limbic system, clouds of electricity drifting through the brain. Every man is broken into twenty-four-hour fractions, and then again within those twenty-four hours. It's a daily pantomime, one man yielding control to the next: a backstage crowded with old hacks clamoring for their turn in the spotlight. Every week, every day. The angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man, and in turn to the sex addict, the introvert, the conversationalist. Every man is a mob, a chain gang of idiots.  This is the tragedy of life. Because for a few minutes of every day, every man becomes a genius. Moments of clarity, insight, whatever you want to call them. The clouds part, the planets get in a neat little line, and everything becomes obvious. I should quit smoking, maybe, or here's how I could make a fast million, or such and such is the key to eternal happiness. That's the miserable truth. For a few moments, the secrets of the universe are opened to us. Life is a cheap parlor trick.  But then the genius, the savant, has to hand over the controls to the next guy down the pike, most likely the guy who just wants to eat potato chips, and insight and brilliance and salvation are all entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic. " -Jonathan Nolan, in Memento Mori.  I think this describes the way I felt a couple days ago perfectly. I recommend reading the entire story,  urlLink [here] .

      It is amazing how much a person can change in a year. I was just looking at my an older blog of mine. Man, I was a  very  different person back then. It's frightening. I shall dub these times, the "pre-blurrpi" stages, because after I met my friend Blurrpi, I went through some radical changes.   "Saturday, March 01, 2003 Welp, its that time of the day again..time to bore you with my boring uneventful day. -_- Well, on with the boring story... Ok, I woke up to find that half my room was CHARRED! THERE WAS A FIRE WHEN I WAS ASLEEP! I jumped up put on some shoes and crawled out my window onto the roof, there were still flames coming from the top of my house, so I hadto jump. It took no smaller then 3 seconds to gain the courage, adreniline is awesome. I landed in my yard and ran as far from the collapsing pile of flaming wood. From all the excitment i didn;t notice untill now that my whole area had been hit by a chemical bomb! I suddenly heard a moaning sound from behind me, startled I turned around to be confronted with a horde of flesh eating zombies! THE CHEMICAL BOMB TURNED MY NEIGHBORHOOD INTO ZOMBIES! I whipped out my trusty shotgun and pursued my way to the street out of my neighborhood shooting zombies left and right, i had 100 feet to go and I was out of ammo! There were still zombies all around me, I chucked the gun into one, but there were still many many more. I looked around for an escape as they slowly closed in on me, then right out of nowhere a T-REX COMES AND CHOMPS THEM ALL UP! I am releived for a short second untill i realize I am face to face with a tarranasauras rex!!! AAAH! I ren into the nearest home barely escaping the sharp jaws of he beast. I know I am not safe so I seek cover in the best safe spot I can find. the SMAAAASH! The roof caves in , a giant foot scrapes the tip of my nose as I jump back in fright...OK OK...thats not what happened...  Here is what really happened... I woke up from a really wierd dream which i don't care to explain right now, I did some boring stuff on my computer, played an extremely fun and exciting game of DDR (DDR could never be boring) and ate a boring bowl of cereal. Then I went back up to my boring room, sat in my boring chair and did more boring stuff. Followed by a very boring game of sit and do nothing. Upon finishing i realized it was boring old lunch time, I ate a boring sandwich with boring chicken chees tomatos and mayonaise. My friend played 30 minutes of boring gamecube and went away to his boring home to see a boring movie with his friends, leaving me to be even more bored then I was. Then I did more boring stuff for a couple hours, then ate boring macaroni for dinner. Then I played more DDR and now all the boring stuff from earlier doesn't matter because DDR always makes me happy! ^_^  Well, Be seeing ya! posted by BuddytheRat at 8:07 PM"   That really was what most of my days consisted of a year ago. Listening to techno, sitting around being bored, obsessing a little too much over Dance Dance Revolution. Then blurrpi came along, and everything just changed so rapidly. She changed the music I listened to, got me interested in reading, and philosophy, and knowledge. Then I became sort of an elitist, without really noticing or caring at first. She told me it's hard not to, which I agree with, but I still was mad at myself for it, and then, as blurrpi always does, she gave me some advice that completely changed my way of thinking.    Blurrpi: My friend Tracy and I spend most of our time making fun of one another.  She calls me an elitist bastard. Blurrpi: It's just because I have the taste I do. Blurrpi: I mean, it started as that.  She'd say she's reading some silly teenage novel about some girl that wants to commit suicide, I'd make a face. Blurrpi: But after a while we just began goofing on one another.  She thinks I'm an elitist, even though I don't think I'm that snobby about it, simply because of my taste.  I accept that she views me as an elitist bastard, she accepts that I view her as liking trivial crap. Blurrpi: No matter what if you say you like Adaptation people will call you a pretentious elitist. Blurrpi: You can't avoid it. Blurrpi: Heh.  All you can do is have the people that you care about/care about you understand your taste, and you understand theirs, and live comfortably without hoping to change one another.  If you try to change other people because of your choices, then we have a problem. Blurrpi: But if you simply discuss and enjoy and such, don't worry.   What she said made perfect sense, but it didn't quite stick untill now, after i've read through my old blog. I was so nice to people back then. Now i'm a pretentious bastard.  Realising you've made a mistake can be kind of nerve racking, but learning to correct that mistake is one of the most gratifying feelings in the world.  Here are some other entertaining things I found in my old blog, that i'm just showing for the hell of it:  Amazingly, the link still works.  " Monday, March 10, 2003 Hey again! My new DDR pad came in today! =D Its awesome! It doesn't slide around AT ALL! =D Also, i have been toyin around with my new stop motion hobbie, check out this little short i made of two lego people having a western style duel ^_^  urlLink [Click]  Well thats all for now. Cya posted by BuddytheRat at 10:21 PM "  Aw. " Wednesdays suck. Especially for me. I can't really think of anything to talk about. My mind is dead right now. I don't really know why I work so hard on this blog, nobody reads it. Maybe i'll advertise it in some forums. ya...i'll do that. *sigh* I swear I am going to go insane. I can't take this any longer. Sitting here at my computer all day is driving me nuts. I need to go to school with other ppl. For all you kids that think I am lucky to be homeschooled, think again. Homeschool is the suckiest thing in the world.  I'm gonna finish pixelating the portrait of kidd for my game...i'll see ya later today.. =| Buh Bye...

      I stay up all night long so I can catch my mom when she wakes up, so she can give me some help on what to choose. (She has three other sons that have gone through highschool, so I was pretty sure she'd know what to do.) She just tells me to leave it blank.   Now I have to stay up the rest of the day. Bleh.  I'll try to post often, to keep myself busy. But i'll probably be too drained to do anything at all pretty soon. Meh. I'm sure you've had enough of these personal greif tales, so i'll keep them to myself for awhile.

      So, my mom hasto turn in the enrollment forms for highschool today. I hafto choose electives, and it is a really, really hard choice. I get to choose 4 different things. 2 electives, and 2 more electives that each take only a single semester to complete, or, I can choose 3 normal length electives.  I already know I want Art 1 and Newspaper. The third one is where I'm having trouble. I'm KIND of sure I want to choose French. But, even if I finally decide, I then have to choose 4 more electives as back-ups incase schedule problems make it impossible for me to be in a class I chose.  Gah. I have no idea.

      They really are. So many people get offended by a synonym for poo, it's madness. What really makes me chuckle, though, is when people incorporate "jesus christ" or "god" in their cursing. Am I wrong for finding that funny?   It reminds me of kids in a schoolyard, making up ryhmes to chant at some poor kid with a big nose, and how upset he'll get. I don't curse in the company of people whom might be offended though, and I never find it funny when used to blatantly put someone down.  Just thought i'd lighten the mood with something not so.. boring.

      You'll have to excuse that last post, I was had a sudden wave of emotions. Near the end of writing the post I began frantically complaining to my friend. Taking all my emotions out of storage, giving them one last look, and then throwing them away.   [Silly metaphorical version that probably gives you the wrong idea] The feelings came and left so swiftly. I felt empty afterwards. Just minutes before I was so full of energy and passion, as I poured my guts out onto my unsuspecting friend, and then, with no more guts to keep me alive I sit there motionless, without the energy to scrape them back into my stomach. I  wanted  them back in now, they made me feel aliv  [More straight forward version] The feelings came and left so swiftly. I had no control over it, it just happened. I can't control my emotions, my emotions control me. Right now, I'm not sad about it. When I think back about it, it makes me kind of happy. I'm glad it happened. But at the time I hated everything with a burning passion. It's really really strange.   I wrote two versions, 'cause I was in the mood for some metaphorical writing. I need to practice, don't I? At the present moment I suck at it.

      I just got back from seeing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with my mom and Brothers #1 and #2. I'm kind of pissed at myself, because I didn't pay the slightest bit of attention to what was going on. I don't know why I was so out of it. Thinking back it was all a haze, except the big finale of the movie, which I didn't understand because of my lack of attention at the beginning. Gah, so pissed.  So, after watching who knows what, and walking out of the theatre, Brother #1 decided he wanted to take the long route through the mall so he could have some ice cream, from a place he claims makes the best ice cream ever. It tasted like any other ice cream i've ever had, except that it was expensive as hell. Before it was even handed to me it was already sort of melting. "Too much cream and not enough ice." I thought. I couldn't eat faster than it could melt, so by the time I was int he car it was all over my hand. I put it in a cup and gave it to brother #2. I wanted to say to Brother #1, "Brother #1, your taste in ice cream is alot like your taste in movies." but at the last second I changed it to, "Your taste in ice cream sucks."  I'm not sure why I made the last second change. Maybe because brother #2 was there? Ever since I made that post about "The Day After Tomorrow" i've wanted to erase it. I sound like an ass in that post, bashing my mom and my brother, calling them shallow.  Ever since I've started reading and watching more intelligent movies, i've been so proud of myself. I try way too hard to look smarter then everyone. I'm starting to hate it now. I don't want to be cruel, or, atleast I don't want to be thought of as cruel. But, i've been doing exactly what I hate.  I have this friend. She is the one who got me to start reading and watching the movies that I watch nowadays. She also got me interested in philosophy, and helped me to appreciate learning, etc. Ugh, this is hard to write down, but I hafto continue. Ok, so, this friend of mine is extremely smart. I admire her. Maybe a bit too much. Now, normally, i'd be admiring any other random girl. I'd fall in love with any girl i'd meet. Now, everyone else pales in comparison.   I don't know why I'm mentioning her, actually. I'm not mad at her or anything, or, maybe I am? I just don't know. I'm mad at myself for being an elitist asshole, that I know for sure.  I.. don't really have anything else to say. Good to get some things off my chest I s'pose.

      I suppose all of you would like to be updated on my Area 51 game. Well, i've still got some planning to do, but me and my co-artist guy have made some tiles and put them together to form a mock-up shot of what the game is going to look like.  We have two objects here, a crate and a barrel. The crate is pushed in 4 directions, up, down, left, and right. The barrel is only pushed in two directions, and when pushed it will roll untill something stops it. Also, when pushed into water, the barrel will float and create a platform for crossing.     That's about all we have. Exciting, eh? I'm pretty much brain dead on any other possible puzzle elements. I'm still trying to decide how buttons will work, and lots of other stuff. So, i'll keep you updated.

      Let's talk about brother#2. The one reading my blog. He's not as bad as brother#1, but he's pretty bad.  He used to share all the anime DVD's he got from netflix with me, untill I told him I didn't like one of the shows that he liked. He completely disbanded my anime supply.  I wouldn't spend the time to watch something because I didn't like the few first episodes, and he told me that I should give things more of a chance or something, and then *poof*, no more anime for me.   Brother#2 is still cool though, unlike brother#1 whom is the opposite of cool, maybe i'll talk about him later, most likely at a time when he's done something to piss me off (which is rather often).   I still think I worry about what people think of me. Of course I do, that's a natural feeling. I don't think there is anything wrong with that feeling though. If I don't show my ignorance, nobody will smack me on the head and tell me i'm being ignorant, and thus, I will stay ignorant.  So, thanks brother#2. You've always been there to hit me on the head when I needed it.

      I hate prejudice. Yet I still can't help but feel it about people. It's a natural human trait to want to feel better then other people, isn't it?   Life is so ironic, sometimes it's funny, no matter how horrible it is, but depending on your mode of thought, either you're laughing at it, or it's laughing at you. That's funny, and sad.  I'm just getting thoughts off my brain. I guess I'm being more free in what I write, even if I know my brother is reading it. I'm sick of worrying about what other people think of my blog, so i'm going to stop worrying, and start writing.

      I really should. And, if that's not possible, I should atleast keep them to myself.  I recently discovered that one of my brothers is reading my blog, I did give him the link and everything, but that was a long time ago when I wasn't making a fool of myself with all these latest posts. Bah. I should just change the URL, but a part of me wants him to read it.  I still stand by most of what I said in my last post, there are just a few sentences in there that I want to remove. Actually, maybe I don't. Whatever.

      I've wanted to write about evolution for awhile, so here I go.  Evolution's struggle, is when humanity and evolution begin to grind into eachother, slowing eachother down. As we evolve from apes, to cavemen, to the humans we are now, we suddenly reach a grinding halt.  When you try to imagine a human race much more evolved then now, a perfect race, it scares you. Everything would be equal, everything would be flat, and boring. But, we wouldn't feel boredom. We wouldn't feel anything at all. Emotions are worthless. But we love them, and can't possibly imagine being without them. Thus the grinding between evolution and tradition. Irony in it's purest form. We love to love, yet love holds us back.  Is evolution continually slowing down? Will it reach the climax of it's grinding and then suddenly sky rocket? I have no fuckin' idea. I don't know much about the topic. I am glad for the people of the future. They will cherish the flat equality of their world as we cherish the chaotic waves of our own.  I'm not going to talk about the topic anymore, because I really have no clue what in the hell i'm talking about. It sure is fun to think about though.  You know, I am starting to think that thinking, all by itself, makes a person smarter. I remember hearing that einstien used to sit in a chair for hours, staring at a wall, just thinking. Not letting other people's thoughts disturb him. (TV is a good example of that.) The mind, filled constantly with it's surroundings, never having time to actually think and act on it's own. The brain, by itself, is the key to everything.   A friend of mine and I always have this argument about escapeism. I'm into lucid dreaming, dreaming consciously. Not day dreaming, but taking control of you're actual nightly dreams. (If you don't beleive me, look at www.ld4all.com) Slowly I am starting to agree with her. It's weird, but no matter how much I disagree with her, it always seems to creep it's way into my mind and  change  me. I don't even know if it's a concious or subconsious happening, but it happens.   We're ALWAYS thinking, constantly. Sometimes it happens without us even acknowledging it. It's crazy, but our minds know the answers, and if we hear the truth, we automatically accept it. Not right away, but after awhile, we realise, because it's the truth, and our minds know it. I didn't read this, I just thought it up. I'm not bragging, i'm just backing up the fact that our minds know everything.  Or maybe they don't? I don't know. Or do I? I don't care. Do we have a limit? Can I think so much that I can't think anymore? I'll just hafto keep thinking to find out. But will I never find out? I'll probably die before than.   Maybe all the brilliant people in the world just thought more often then others? I mean, we think all the time, but, like I said, mostly we are thinking the thoughts orbiting around us, filling our minds. Visual thoughts, auditory thoughts, and so so much more. I wonder how cleary a person could think in complete darkness, with medicine to completely numb all feeling in their body? Would their thoughts just skyrocket? I want to try that. I really, seriously, want to try that. My own little experiment with thought.  God, I just don't want to stop typing, I don't want to stop thinking now. I'm trapped in the glory of thinking and learning without any external sources. But am I really learning? Like I said I don't know. Or do I? Wait, we've done this already. Is that the stopping point of my thought train? Is that where I can't think anymore? I mean, I can go back and take other tracks, but when I reach that one point I also end up asking questions, instead of stating what might be facts. I wish I could break that wall. Could I? I don't know.   How many side tracks can I take untill I run out and have nothing else but the wall? Is it infinite? Is it not? I just.. don't know. Maybe I need complete peace to find it out. My completely numb, non-visual, non-auditory, thinking mode. I'd even request that I be blindfolded, then carried to a place i've never been to, so I can't even imagine where I might be. I'd still imagine other places though, wouldn't I? It's impossible to think completely clearly, or is it? I don't think it is. I don't beleive in the impossible. I can damn well try though, can't I? I fucking will try.  It's neat how everything links up. If I think of one thing long enough, I'll could end up anywhere else. A crazy web of connections. Is there anything at all that isn't connected to anything else? Becuase of that, is it impossible to reach? Maybe it is connected, it's just blocked, by the wall I talked about. I'm just rambling now, but, I have been rambling this whole post. If I don't stop seen nobody will take the time to read this. I don't care if they do. They could always think of it themselves. They have the ability to do that. (Or do they?)   I know why I started to hate my post about "The Day After Tomorrow". I was being prejudice to people just like me. It's not their fault. Nothing is anybody's fault. Blame is a horrible word. A horrible horrible word. You know, now that i'm in this thinking mode of everyone being equal, i'm starting to think maybe we ARE in that flat land of the future. But maybe not. I don't know.  Maybe I do need other people's thoughts to help me along. Maybe I need to stack a shitload of books next to the wall, so I can climb upward, and once I reach the top of the wall, I'll be high enough to jump to the strange unconnected, hidden land of thoughts. I won't be able to get back though, or will I? Will I take everything from the other side of the wall with me and connect it myself?   I sure love metaphors. Maybe I use them too much? I don't know. I hafto stop. I will stop now, so you can read this. I don't hafto type everything I think. I can think after I stop typing. So NYAH!  The end..

       urlLink Travis  and I were digging around in my brother's old room the other day. We found alot of great things, such as my old  urlLink SNES Mouse . The little mouse that takes the place of the controller,  and is used in certain games, such as  urlLink Mario Paint .   I also found, as the title implies, a book.  Catch-22 . A friend told me a little about this book, she said it was pretty good, so I kept it and started reading it. Upon opening the book I was very surprised to see my mother's name, with the last name she had before she married my dad, drawn on the inside of the front cover in half bubble, half normal lines, like a middle or highschooler might have done. She obviously read this book a very long time ago, I'd guess sometime in highschool.  Than I reach page four, and find some underlined text. That's pretty normal. But on the opposite page, page 5, to the right of all the text is the word, " urlLink *M*A*S*H* " written vertically along the edge of the page, for no apperant reason. Two more pages later it re-appears. In the same place on the page as last time. But to the right of it, also vertically, it says, "-again-".  A little later, I noticed on the front of the book, where the numbers "22" are printed in rather large stylistic letters, a small imprint, left by a pen or something, lining the inside of the numbers.   I found this to be very funny. Not merely because of what is written, but because it was written by my mom when she was a kid. Intresting to think if she intended for the future holder of the book to see the notes or not. I wonder how she would react if I showed it to her.  (I tried an interesting new way of posting, by linking images or articles about various things I mention in each post. It's a little more work, but it makes it more interesting.)

      This is my personal confession booth. My way of communicating to the world. Hopefully my brother still reads this. I intended for that last post to be read by him. I know I can't teach my mom to be more disciplinary, but he certainly can.  I don't know what exactly it is about the internet, but for me it's a world with no anxiety. Without it my life wouldn't be much of a life at all. I wonder how many brilliant people went unnoticed because they were unable to share their ideas to the world without any fear?   So, I just thought I'd share that.

So now i'm just walking around aimlessly, complaining about it in my head, when I could be doing something about it.  I tell myself I can't do anything about it. I'm lazy and I'm going to stay that way. But I think if someone just tried to nudge me along and force me to do things I don't normally do, I'd learn to do them. My mom never disciplines me. I hate her for that. My room is extremely untidy. My mom only tells me to clean it. But, I tell myself that everyday. I don't listen to her or myself.   Although, I imagine if she did try to force me i'd be a brat about it. It's not something i'm used to, and I guess I just can't deal with it. But, if she were persistent it'd work. I know it would work.   It's kind of odd, that I know well enough that I need discipline, but I can't carry out any of that discipline on my own.  I'm positive you're sick of all these self pity posts by now. Well to hell with you. Go read someone elses blog.

      So, I had another interesting idea for a game. With lack of anything else to post, I will tell you about it.   Ok, so it's a turn based strategy game, but also a puzzle game. Final Fantasy Tactics meets Tetris. How? Well, i'm still working on that, but my general idea is that you and your enemies troops each take on different colors, and grouped colors die together. .. Like I said, i'm still working it out.  It's been harder to think of things to post lately. Oh well.  I made a sister-blog to alphabet soup. You can find it  urlLink here .

       [Warning: The following post contains spoilers to both Spiderman 2 and the book 1984.]   Just got back from seeing Spiderman 2. I enjoyed it. And now I shall discuss it... with.. myself.   In the movie, Peter loses his powers, because he distanced himself from Mary Jane, and is on the verge of losing her completely. Later in the movie, Mary Jane is captured, and he miraculously gets his powers back. This doesn't bother me in the least. Superhero movies call for superhero logic.   Just like the last movie, the end, and the basic moral of the story I liked the most. Here we have Spiderman, fighting crime, helping the City. Here we have Peter, late for class, exhausted, losing Mary because of his web-slinging counter-part. So he quits. (Half because of his loss of powers, half because he wants what is best for Peter. He wants what is best for himself, instead of the city.) This reminds me of the end of 1984, which I finished reading recently, where Winston gives into the Party, and lets them control his mind because he stopped caring about Julia, and had nobody to love but himself. And then, the best line of the whole movie, when Mary leaves the guy she was going to marry, on the wedding day, returns to Peter's apartment, knowing that by doing this, she is putting her very life in danger, and says, "You rescue people everyday. Now it's someone elses turn to rescue you." or something along those lines.   Judging by the end, a 3rd intallment is definitly going to be made. So i'm looking forward to that.  So hoorah for Spiderman, and hoorah for superhero logic!

      I have some very random memories from a long long time ago, that I distinctly remember for no reason.  The first one that came to mind just now was sitting in Mrs. Perry's class in the 1st grade. I made a little drawing of my head, with two stick hands tearing out the hair, and above it I wrote, "I hate school!". Why I hated school, I do not know. I turned to the kid on my right, and showed him the little drawing. He looked very upset, and proceeded to show the teacher what I had done, and she was angry.  Another memory from the same grade. I was out on the playground, going forward and backward and forward and backward on one of those animal things on the big spring. I think this time it was a duck. I obviously had other things on my mind because everybody else had already gone back to class, and I didn't notice a thing. They sent someone out to get me after awhile.  I also distinctly remember playing by myself alot. Not all the time, just sometimes, and I would go to this cage of bars type thing, and pretend it was sometype of arena, and lizard people with swords would fight me, and I would kick their asses, and then escape. I did that alot. And then, this one time, a kid came up to me, and asked if he could play too. I couldn't imagine how it would work with more people then me, and, not to my surprise, it didn't work at all.  Another memory. The school was in my neighborhood, in easy walking distance from my house, so I walked home every day. Once I couldn't see the school anymore I would start running, scared to death, because I always thought someone was going to chase me and grab me. I was very paranoid.  So, later on in the middle of the school year I switched schools, for reasons I don't remember. I remember my first day there, and I was rather upset from the change. When all the other kids walked in I distinctly remember making fun of each of them in my mind, deciding right then and there that I would never be friends with them.  And this one time, on St. Patrick's day. While we went away for lunch or something like that, the principle and some other people took the time to create flour foot prints into our class, carefully turn all the desks on their sides, and upside down, and all disorganised, and left footprints leading out and down the hall. When we returned one of the girls in my class began to cry, because leprechauns had vandalised our beautiful classroom. So we followed the footprints, wearing our trusty green shaded leprechaun vision goggles, and found the little bastard in the office. A stuffed leprechaun doll. We then took him back to the class and stuck him in our pre-made tissue box leprechaun traps, to starve and rot and suffer in his guilt. *cough*  Not exactly the most pleasant memories. But they are fun to look back on. I was a weird little kid. I'm still a weird little kid.

      I made some art! (omg!) Yes. I don't normally do something like that, but lately i've been alot more confident in what I draw, despite it's crappyness. I think it's because I friend demanded that I show him my art, and after awhile of him barking at me and me cowering, I gave in, and actually realised that not everything I create is horrible. Bragging is healthy.  Ok, so anyways, the fromamouth.com 4UM's have a weekly art thing, just like eatpoo does, but with the Fromamouth.com 4UM, I don't hafto worry about being driven away by all the proffesional artist types. It's alot more free n' such, and doesn't focus entirely on keeping a proffesional community.  Anyways , here's my entry. The activity was,  "Draw yourself as a monster/animal."  and I took the obvious choice.       Ta-da!  And yes, i'm aware of the uncanny resemblance to a certain annoying platformer character.. I honestly didn't notice it myself untill I finished.

      Devon used to be a fairly athletic guy, always running around, doing sports. He wasn't the best, but, he definitely wasn't the worst. But in time, he matured and became somewhat of a nerd. He was always on his computer, his brother gave it to him once he moved out and got a better one, so it wasn't a great computer. His friends, few friends, described it as 'ancient.' His life wasn't all that boring until one day...so he thought.  Devon was at his little computer, typing away for a research project for his college history class. He was writing a 10 page essay over the Revolutionary War. It was due tomorrow  and he was only on the 7th page. To make matters worse, he was really stressing out and when he looked at the clock it read: 2:16 AM.  "Crap, why did I wait so long to do this! Prof. Neits assigned it a week ago, and I blew it off until three days before." He sighed. He finished the sentence he was typing and leaned back in his comfy chair, his only escape from the major pressure, with his arms behind his head. The screen flashed black then a greenish blue screen popped up.   "Oh my God! What happened to my report!!" he screamed as he slapped the computer hoping it might help.  It flashed white then blue again and typed out the message:  "m-th-r k-dn-pp-d. -ddr-ss = time, r-ck p-th."  "What is that supposed to mean? It's in some sort of code, or something...Wait a minute, there aren't any vowels! Except in time. I wonder why.." Devon questioned. "Hmm...maybe the dashes took place of certain vowels?? M-_-T-H-_-R..Hmmm, M-A, nah. M-E? nope...M-I!...no..M-O! M-O-T-H-E-R...Mother?! What about her!!" He screamed, as if it were a living person.  Devon spent hours, it seemed, trying to crack the rest of the message. So far he had Mother kidnapped. Address = time rock path. He still was unsure what the time was for. Eventually, the remembered it was 2:16 when this message came up.  "216 Rock Path? That's not an address anywhere near here." wondered Devon. "What addresses do I know of that have a 216 in their address.."  After about 10 minutes of thinking, he finally had it.  "216 Rock Path stands for 216 Stoney Road! It's only a few blocks from here!" he shouted "But why would my mom be at the library? Oh well, I better go look for her."  For some unknown reason, he got up, tossed his bag over his shoulder, and headed out the door.  "What the-!" exclaimed Devon as he peered around outside. It was daylight. "How is this possible?! My computer said 2:16!"  He decided it didn't matter seeing as he had to get to his mother's aid. Then, he realized that his mom was here, in New York. When she lived in Kansas.  "Wait a minute. How can she be here?" asked Devon, as if there was some all-knowing guru right next to him. "No time though, I must get to her."  He trekked on and eventually reached the library. It seemed to be standing unusually taller than normal but he ignored it.  "216 Stoney Road. This is it" he said. As he walked into the library.   There was a spiral staircase. He walked up to it, looked upwards, only to see it going up very high. Too high He saw the ceiling and figured his mother might be there seeing as she wasn't on the first floor. He started hiking up the staircase getting nearer to the ceiling, and to his mom. He was looking up the whole time but, when he looked down, he appeared to be on the third step still. This threw his equilibruim off and he stumbled. But, the ceiling wasn't any further away than when it was a second ago. He got up and started up the stairs once again. After hours, it seemed, he finally go to the top. He peered over the edge of the floor and saw his mother tied to a chair at the end of a hallway of bookcases. He hurried up the rest of the way and dashed to his mother. As he neared her, her heard her screaming something.  "G-- -p!!! W-k- u- D---n!!" she screamed.  Slowly, the message became clear. She was screaming 'Get up! Wake up Devon!' Devon, realizing he was in a dream, he suddenly awoke to find himself in his room. But, it wasn't his room as it had been in the dream. Not his sheetless bed, cluttered desk and shelves. But, it was his twin bed, with dinosaur sheets and pillow, his rug with a street and town imprinted on it. The rug had toys scattered everywhere on it.  "Devon! Get up! It's time for school!!"

      "LANCE! WAKE UP! NOW!!" A large man with a deep voice was banging on the door to Lance's bedroom.  It was six o'clock in the morning, and Lance rolled over with a sigh.  He opened his eyes to look at his clock.  "Ugh, I hate this... especially on a Monday..." he shut his eyes and went back to sleep.    Twenty minutes later Lance's father came into the room, dressed for work in a black business suit and a tie.  "Lance," he started "It looks like I'll have to get you out of bed again." he walked over to the side of the bed and pulled back Lance's warm covers.  Lance's legs shot up to his chest the moment the cold morning air touched him; he shivered a little.  His dad then lifted the matress off on one side, sending Lance rolling over onto the floor with a thud.  "DAD! I told you not to do that anymore!" he said, shooting up.  His dad replied with a small devlish smile on his face, "maybe next time I should pour cold water on your head instead?"  Lance shouted back "NO!  Come on dad, I'm never late for school." "Only because I get you up." his dad replied.  Two minutes later they left the house, Lance was chewing on a cereal bar and trying to flatten his messy brown hair which he had no time to comb.  "Got everything?" his dad asked.  "Yeah, everything except a good night's sleep." Lance said with a small yawn.  He saw his dad get into his car and drive off to work.  Lance lived in a small community just outside of the city, so his house just across the street from school.    In Twenty minutes the first period bell rang.  Lance was practially falling asleep, he stayed up too late doing homework, only because he chatted over AIM too long.  His dad didn't get home until very late, so it's not like his dad would really care on the way home from work.  First period was Geometry, and he wondered why this class had to be first period of the day.  "Class." a blonde haired teacher addresed the class, "pull out your homework.  Problems 1-65 please." Lance's heart sank... he didn't do his homework!  "Oh, what am I going to tell hi-" he stopped mid-thought, walking across the room, her blonde hair flowing in the air behind her, was Alexa. She walked past the window which overlooked the flowers in front of the school, her glowing blue eyes flashed in Lance's direction, and for a moment, both eyes met, and the-  "Looking at the beauty of God's work, Lance?" the teacher asked. "Uh, y-y-yes, sir.  I mean, no sir, I mean-" Lance replied, wondered if the teacher saw him looking at Alexa. The teacher replied sarcastically "I know how beautiful the flowers in the garden are, but please try and pay attention.  Now, you're homework?"  The last bell rang, and Lance picked up his bag and headed for his locker. Behind him walked Alexa and some of her friends.  He wondered if he'd ever get to make a move, she was always hanging around with her friends, and it's not like he could just pull up in some nice expensive car and drive away alone with her, impressing both Alexa and her friends.  He headed outside, going home, but stopped at a tree to think.  After banging his head against the tree several times, he saw Alexa come out for tennis practice.  Several rounds went by, when all of a sudden a voice popped up from behind Lance.  "Painful, isn't it.  You're whole world standing just beyond that fence, just out of reach."  Lance seemed not to notice too much "it's only a fence..." he replied back.  The guy behind him answered that, "a very big fence, can't have stray tennis balls flying out... or flying in for that matter."  "No.. we wouldn't want tha-  HEY!" Lance jumped back.  Standing behind him was a shrimpy kid with red hair and brown eyes, he was obviously a freshman.  "What are you sneaking up on people for?"  After several minutes of talking, Lance really only found out the guys name was Mike, and he skipped all of middle school because of his intelligence, but knew how he could help Lance get Alexa.  "Um, but if you skipped all of middle school... wouldn't that mean, you know... you're a nerd?  And uh, incapeable of getting a date?"  Mike looked stunned, "well, if you don't want my help, you're doing a greeeeaaat job already with getting your date.  So I'll be out of your way."  as Mike walked away, Lance realized how good off he WASN'T in getting Alexa.    The next day after school, Lance was in his position.  Mike had reset the electronic message board in front of the school to read "ALEXA, I LOVE YOU", and then Mike would set off some fireworks or something.  Lance could care less about fireworks, he just wanted the message to be seen.  Alexa would soon come out from tennis practice, but one of the last ones to leave so all of her friends wouldn't be there.  He waited, and waited, and waited.  Until at last, after what seemed like an hour (but was really only five minutes) Lance got up the courage to go find her himself.  He walked around the corner, only to see Alexa making out with some other guy!  How could this happen?!   Lance quickly tured around and headed home.  Moments later he heard the fireworks go off, so he suspected that Mike sent them off, and also wondered if he turned on the sign.  If Mike DID turn on the sign, it was probably in the other guy's favor.  He gave a big sigh as he fell backwards onto his bead.  "Oh well, life moves on I guess." he said to himself.  "but I really did like her..."

      "Dimitri! Wake up!" yelled Drew, one of Dimitri's crew buddies.  "Huh? Aaaaaah!" screamed Dimitri, still thinking he was falling toward the deep turquoise waters of the ocean.   "Whoah buddy, calm down, you are safe inside the ship on a nice cot now, don't worry" reassured Winters.   "Ouch! Ughh...what h-happened? Where am i-I?" mumbled Dimitri as he flinched the moment he felt a shock of pain run through his battered leg.  "You were hanging on the anchor after being hit by that cannon ball. You fainted, but, you still hung on. You saved my life." said Winters. Dimitri noticed the faintest trace of sympathy within his gaze. "Thank you. And, thank God we managed to get you up. Drew here had to go down there with a rope around his waist. He carried you up to safety!"   "Heh, th-thanks Drew. But, d-did we win the battle?" said Dimitri, shivering from loss of blood.  "Yes we did. It was a close one though. They got us pretty badly. I have some of the crew working on those dents below deck. It's a good thing we built her sturdy!" chuckled Winters.  As Dimitri looked around the room from the soft cot they had lain him on, he saw Drew, Winters and a few other crew mates he sometimes talked to including Jake, Gavin, and Hector. He started to smile, knowing that all these people were here because they cared for him, just as everything started spinning and became fuzzy, he blacked out yet again.  His peaceful sleep was broken by another dream. It started just as the other one ended.   It was a trap...

         Dimitri hung from the anchor hole as best he could, the shock still held him in its numbing grip. He could see Cptn. Winters yelling, but the noise was shier void, as if audio has seized. Dimitri held fast for a time into the battle, but has only the strength of a man, and finally his grip faltered, and he plunged into the turquoise water.      The following few minutes were a total blur of blue and white foam, but by a godsend chance, he ended up on a plank, 100 or more yards out, it was all he could do to hold to the board as he drifted farther, and again, passed into darkness...     Again awaken, this time, to the lumbering shadow of a Royal Battle Ship. Then he noticed a life raft headed in his direction, with fully armored gaurdsmen ready to escourt him to the abyss. He made a feble attempt to flee, but it was only an aimless paddle outward, and he soon stood before the Admiral of the Royal Navy Fleet.     It was a trap...

      His happy thought was soon interrupted by a loud *CRACK*. Across the room, there was a large, splintered dent in the hull of the ship. He jumped, dropping Wesley to the floor. Wesley hurriedly scurried off to his same little cove in the flour, but, Dimitri had nowhere to go.  "We are surrounded!" said a crew member, shortly followed my another loud crack directly behind Dimitri. He was thrown forward by the sheer force of the blow to the hull. Dimitri decided to run up on deck to see what the heck was happening.  When he saw Winters standing there, calm and fierce, at the same time, he too was clam for a second. A very short second. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a huge steel ball flying through the air straight for the captain's back.  "CAPTAIN! WATCH OUT!" scream Dimitri as he dove to protect the captain. The ball thankfully misses Winters, but, Dimitri wasn't so lucky. The cannon ball had bashed his right leg from the knee down to no return. It's force carried Dimitri, away from the captain toward the edge of the deck. He fell down the side of the ship. The captain was sure, he would never see that young, intellegent Dimitri again.  He slowly walked to the edge of the ship to see the fate of his young hero. Everything around him seemed to go in slow motion as he peered over the edge to see young Dimitri hanging from the anchor hole.

      He walked carefully accross the slightly flour covered floor, taking special care of where he placed each foot. Upon reaching the wall he slid down onto the floor, his knees bent into his stomach. He surveyed the floor around him, looking for something. His face lit up at the sight of his partner. A large fat, grey haired rat, was laying, almost squished, between two bags of flour. Dimitri greeted his furry companion, and gave him a little scratch on the nose. "Hello there, Wesley." The rat instantly began grinding it's teeth, making the clicking noise all rats make when overjoyed.  Dimitri reached into his vest pocket, and pulled out a shimmering gold coin. The rat's eyes burst with joy at the sight of it. It began scraping away at the floor with it's paws, slowly, but surely pulling itself out of it's little cave. (How it got in there in the first place, is another mystery of the universe.) Then, like a bullet out of a rifle, Wesley the Rat came rocketing out of his hole. His head slammed into Dimitri's outstreched hand, and bounced back. Taking a second to regain his thoughts, he than grabbed the coin in his paws, gave it a snif, and than a bite. He looked up once more at Dimitri's face, to show his gratification, and scampered off, down a hole in the floor.   Wesley returned from his home in the floor, skipping greetings and immediatley searching Dimitri's hands for another shiny prize. Dimitri handed about 20 coins to the large greedy rat, untill he came back to an empty hand. Dimitri patted him on the head, and scratched him behind the ears, and said, "Don't worry Wes, I'll bring you more another day."  Dimitri had been practicing this ritual for quite awhile now. He's probably stored atleast 300 coins down there. Dimitri smiled to himself. He picked up Wesley and cradled him in his arms, tickling his white belly.   From above, a loud commotion broke out. Dimitri sat nervously, petting the rat to sooth his fear. He'd been through this many times, but it always worried him. The panic in his mind has calmed down a little since his first time in an attack, but never completely. To erase the fear completely would be to erase the human in him, it is impossible. The yelling got louder, Dimitri became more uneasy. He imagined the fight taking place above him. He saw the enemy ship, 4 times as large as his own. He saw a cannonball lodge itself in the side of the ship, and the entire room filling with water. He then saw Captian Winters, fighting to his very last breath, and suddenly, remarkably, most of his worry was soothed. He pictured him and Winters, fighting together, side by side. He smiled to himself again, and waited.

      After seeing the captain's steady gaze, he calmly went back to his room to read. He was reading a very good book. It was an action scene, much like the one he was experiencing at this very moment. The only variation was that it wasn't between two pirate vessels. It was between two small countries a ways south and east of where they were. It was a fiction book so, it never  really  happened. But, it was really interesting. So interesting, he didn't even notice the captain standing in the doorway, giving him that same, comforting, yet forceful green stare.  "We are approaching the enemy ship." explained Winters. "We are just out of firing range so I need you to take cover below deck, on the starboard side."  "Yes sir." said Dimitri as he snapped his book shut and stood up straight.  The captain then turned on his heel, and walked, almost marching, down below deck with Dimitri following. Once below the upper deck, Dimitri once again saw this familiar place. Barrels of ale, bags of curry and flower. There was a different arrangement in the corner with some flower bags. One could tell that Dimitri has been here before and these small battles are no new thing. Little did he know, this was not any ordinary 'small battle.'

      It still amazed Dimitri how organized the crew was. Drunken fools only hours before, they now worked with an ease and grace like no other. Another mystery of the universe, thought Dimitri. Perhaps though, it wasn't all that much of a mystery at all. Dimitri glanced at the captian, and they caught eachothers eyes, and for a split second, Dimitri knew exactly why the Pirates worked so well. The sharp green eyes smiled at Dimitri, and seemed to tell him, "Everything will be alright."

         "Sir! You must awaken! The pirateship Sailbeam has been spotted only half a mile out!" Fumbiling about for his trousers and coat, the news is delivered quickly. "The Captain requests your prescence on the bridge, sir!" Out of the cabin, it was utter pandamonium, men hurried for their cloths and ran to their battle stations, some half nude.    Once on the bridge, he realized that only half the officers were in uniform. "How long till were in range?" asked Captain Winters. "Twenty minuets, if the winds hold", said the navigator  "What are we up against?", the Captain asked  "Armorment unknown," said the weapons specalist," but our range isn't enough to strike first" Dimitri sighed, this was the kind of thing right out of the text book, but he still worried. Would this day end for him at the bottom of the sea?

      In the warm lamplight Dimitri fumbled dizzily around the swaying, creaking, snoring room. Dimly lit all around him were the faces and beards of stinky old men, half asleep, half unconcious. The smell of ale wafted steadily in front of Dimitri's nose, poisoning his every breath. He carefully made his way through a maze of bodies, trying hard not to step on anyone, and then halted in the corner, shining his lamp on a large chest nested next to the wall, bolted to the floor. He exhales, sending dust in swirling patterns in front of his eyes. His attention is temporarily lost in the swirling patterns of light rays through dust. Quickly he snaps back into reality, and reaches into his pocket. His hand emerges from the pocket of his sleeveless white vest, revealing a rather large, rusty key. Hey presses the key into it's rightful hole on the chest, and turns it. Quickly but carefully he opens the large metal framed lid of the chest, and the light from his lamp is reflected back at him, from thousands of golden coins. Hastily, he shuffles a couple handfuls of coins into a small bag, closes the lid, locks the chest, and creeps back through the maze of smelly old men. He climbs up a ladder, breathes a sigh of releif, and retreats to his cabin.   The creaking of the ship continues steadily as Dimitri lay on his back, staring up at the ceiling of his private room. He closes his eyes and has a short moment of peace. Sadly to be soon interupted by tomorrow's duties.

      Hi, my name is Travis and my other blog is  urlLink here.   I hope that this group story blog will turn out well and I will do my best to contribute. I am not much of a writer. But, I think it will be fun to practice writing, especially for school. I want to develop my writing skills, not because I want to be a writer, but, because they need developing. :)  -Travis-

      And with his mighty hand, Buddy created A bowl, and in this bowl, letters and tomato soup. Then with a grace like no other, Buddy called forth the soup crafters, who formed the letters into sentences, and then into paragraphs, and finally into stories.   This will hopefully be a fun group blog in which those who wish to join, and have decent writing ability, can come together to create collaborated stories. Eh, I give it a couple weeks before we give up on it.  So, we'll start a new story every month, and maybe take a break for short one member stories, weekly stories, and any other new interesting things we can think of.  I'll begin by inviting some friends to come join in on the fun. Then we'll attempt to start some sort of story out of our little brains.
