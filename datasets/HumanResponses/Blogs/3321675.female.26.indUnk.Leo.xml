       Why does the color blue mean raspberry-flavored?    what about blueberry? Blueberries aren't blue, they're more like purple. So, they should be called, purpleberries.

      Ok, my husband and I went last night to see Troy.  And after doing some research  a few days before, I noticed a few things from the legend and Hollywood.  For one, Helen's husband, Menelaus, was to live according to legend but in the movie, he dies.  In legend, Paris dies but not in the movie.  Apparently the writer's wanted to keep the "couple" together and not say with legend.  But come on, why should I be surprised?  It's not like this is the first time that Hollywood has changed events to fit what they want.  Look at Pocahontas.  The Disney movie portrayed her as a young beautiful woman, where as in truth, she was fat ugly and REALLY young...like 10.  Capt. John Smith, in the movie, young hansom...in truth, 40-ish, bald, short and so on.    But back to the movie of Troy, other than the little who dies and who doesn't I was just waiting for Hector played by Eric Bana(aka Bruce Banner..Hulk) to start turning green when he got angry.  And Odysseus played by Sean Bean (aka Boromir...Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring)well, with him, it seems like all movies I've seen him in, he dies.  But not this one, first movie where he lives.  And let's not forget Paris played by Orlando Bloom  (Legolas...LOTR trilogy) can't seem to stay away from a bow.  In his first fight scene, can we say wuss.  But it was all good.  How about a half god, Achilles played by Brad Pitt.  Too bad we couldn't see more of his fine butt.  But Brad did spin the whole half god thing a new way.  He made Achilles more human, a little sensitive.  Yeah, he was all for glory, but he also loved his women just as much.  LOL   Now off subject...for the past two days, I've been working alot.  One of the employees I work with has only been working there for 3 weeks but acts like she manages the place.  For instance, it's nonsmoking.  She thinks, hey I work alone mostly, all I have to do is use air freshener.  Which is wrong... smoking inside is prohibited no matter what.  Apparently, she wants to get me fired or something.  But I'm hip to her game.  But that's not all of it.  She gives away merchandise and takes what she wants without paying.  Can we say thief?  I've already told Kevin, the manager, that she gives away stuff.  But from what I saw yesterday, she paid for it...who's to say that she won't the next time.  She says that she pays for the stuff that she takes when she takes it, that I just don't see it...that I'm busy doing other things.  So, knowing what I know,  the first thing that I would do if I become manager is fire her for theft.  fflkda;lkdjf;alkdjf;alskdjf;alskdfja;slkdfjasl;kdfj;alskdfja;sldkfj;alkdfj;aldkfja;slkdfjasl;kdf....that's my mind thinking..LOL    Here's something else...the stores air conditioning doesn't work.  So yesterday and today, I've had to work in heat.  Let's just say, fresh air was cool and naturally felt good.  But that's beside the point.  The point, the AC needs to be fixed   soon .  That's all folks...Please walk calmly single file to the nearest exit.

       You've been invited to a fancy ball but the only thing you have to wear is an orange wooly jumper. What shoes do you wear?     Gee, that's a toughy. Shoes... If I were to wear anything orange, which by the way is NOT my color, I would finish the outfit to really stand out. Fluffy Pink slippers. Who cares that it's a fancy ball, wear what's comfortable...if you call an orange wooly jumper comfortable, more power to ya.

         Ok, just finished my first day at this new job.  Bare in mind, I haven't worked in a year, due to the fact that my husband, Chris wanted me to stay home and be a housewife.  So, after a year and his own job in danger of being nonexistent, I started applying for a job.  Now I'm one of the hundreds of people who work in convience stores.  My day:  spent the entire 8 hours cramming tons of knowledge like, Tic Tacs are 79 cents plus whatever tax....8.25%.  In the middle of the shift, my manager, Kevin tells me that in a few months he'll be leaving and that I'm the first to know... so keep on the downlow.  Then he proceeds to tell me that when he leaves that I'M going to take his place.  Gee, I work for one of their rivals for a few months last year, and now "I'm a veteran of the convience store working class".  So, imagine my shock to hear that on my first day.  Here's something else to rant about...PineSol.  The stuff that was used tonight was so strong that I came home smelling of it.  And I didn't even use it.  Imagine how much stronger it would be when I start using it, or is there a why to dilute it some.     Now the dilemma:  stay with this company full time knowing that I will advance in a few short months or go to school in a few short weeks...if I finish everything in time.  I still need to take my TASP and sign up for classes.  The only thing is, school starts on June 2.  Will I have enough time to work and go to school full time?  I really want to get a degree in English.  But I'm torn, really.  If I don't go to school this summer, the question is:  will I ever?  Will I continue coming up with excuses on not going or take the plunge and actually get my butt in gear and take classes?  The way Kevin was talking, I'll be the new manager by the end of the summer.  And if I decide to become the manager, there will be no time for school.  So, I could wait til the end of the summer find out if I truly do get the promotion then decide then what I want to do.       Confusing...and I'm also tired.  My feet hurt, the ankles the size of softballs.  I haven't stood up for eight hours straight in over a year.  I'm out of condition.  Maybe I need to train myself to sleep standing up, that way when the feet hurt I won't realize it.  LOL  If I do that, then there's a possibility that I'll fall asleep at work.       Well, I'm hitting the bed now.  Tired and falling asleep while typing.  Jen

      In the beginning there was nothing, kinda like the nothing that's between my ears.  LOL  Actually, this is the first time doing a blog so bare with me.  Today unlike most days, I start a new job....hopefully.  Just waiting to hear from the manager to make sure that I'm not some deranged lunatic by doing a background check.  LOL  Like that would really say I'm crazy.  But anyways, thanks to my best friend, Kristyn, I get to ramble about everything, anything, and nothing all at the same time.  Gee, I'm talented.  LOL  Well, not much to say at this junction.  And remember:  AND THE RABBIT HOPPED TWICE!

      Ok, this has been grating on my nerves for almost a week now.  I work in a convenience store, and people think that everyone who works there knows everything about everything in that store.  For example, on Monday, I had a problem with a customer's credit card, so while I was on the phone waiting for someone to give my an authorization code, I continued to wait on the numerous customers who were filing in.  A "man" who was patient enough to wait his turn to pay for his fuel asked him to turn on his pump when it was his turn at the register.  Now, by the time he was at the register, which was about a 5 minute wait, his very impatient friend decided to pay for the fuel with his own credit card.  By this time, the customer with the credit card issue was resolved and I had no line.  The "friend" of the "man" came storming into the store demanding a refund.  Of course, I, who had never had to perform a refund, asked if he had the receipt from outside.  "Yes, I do.  It's on my dashboard, in the truck."  He fumed.  Me being as polite as possible asked him to get his receipt.  He stomps out of the store to retrieve the said paper.  While he was gone, I called the manager and asked what do I do?  Kevin, the manager, walked me through the refund, which took a few minutes seeing as how the keys for the refund isn't marked.  By this time, the "friend" is over the deep end with anger that he can't wait for me to learn how to do a refund.  He just sees that I'm suppose to give him money and that's that.  Once I figure out the steps to take, he snatches the money from my hands before I can get it out of the register.  Instead of being nasty, which thinking back on it I should have, I let him go and smiled at the next customer in line which had formed in a matter of seconds.  Why do people feel that anger and being just plain means that they can get what they want?  I for one feel that what goes around comes around.  I firmly believe in karma.  So, I try to do unto others as I would have them do unto me.  But in some cases that gets me nowhere, except for the occasional someone walking over me.  But I think, that some day soon, they will regret it.  The only problem with that is, what if they don't believe in karma?  Would karma still effect them if they don't believe in it?  It's like believing in God.  If someone dies who doesn't believe that there is a God, will he go to Heaven?  In the work setting, I think that I need to bite my tongue towards people like the "friend" or else I could possibly be fired.  But in my line of work, it's inevitable that I'll come across some narrowminded simpletons who think that they are better than me or whomever they are ranting towards.  In those cases, I know that I must stay calm no matter what and smile.  As my mother always says, "Smile and pour burning hot coals on their heads."  Whenever she says that, it's usually right after she's just finishing her "quiet time with God".  But in a way, she's right.  The more nice you are to someone who is being a complete ass the more it pisses them off.  And all you can say is, look I was nice to the man and he treated me like this.  But I'll continue believing in karma and one day the "friend" will have someone treat him worse than the way he treated me.  So, what goes around comes around...ten fold.

        You've successfully slain the dragon! How will you toast your marshmallows?    Marshmallows? Oh no, Smores baby. Besides, by the time I was done slaining any dragon the place would be on fire. So, toasting anything wouldn't be a problem. If I truly wanted to toast marshmallows, I'd stick them on the dragon's fingers and toast away.  But since I do the whole Smores thing, tin foil wrappings of fun.

      Firstly, my life has turned back to what it once was.  Work,work,work,work.  For years, I worked constantly then one day my husband said..."I want you to stay home and be a housewife."  So, I stopped working after being a workaholic for years.  Now that I'm working again I think that I may be turning into a workaholic again.  Thursday and Friday were my days off.  Yes, I loved the days off, but the thing is, I was bored out of my mind.  And in a few months, there is talk about me getting promoted, so that means more hours.  Tons of hours.   But today was bad.  Really bad.  Besides the usual people being nasty which I've just learned to shrug off, these people don't know how to read.  On the gas pumps there are signs that reads: Pre-pay pumps only.  They need to see these signs.  I'm tired of having to deal with a##holes who walk into the store and think that they run the place because they're customers.  For once, I'd like to tell them off.  But I know that I'd get fired for doing that.  And speaking of getting fired, the girl who was stealing from the store and other things was fired last Wednesday.  Needless to say, I put the final nail in her proverbal cuffin.  The district manager called me Wednesday night to ask me what I've seen while working with her, so with what I told the manager, the girl got fired for not working.  So, that saves me from doing that if I get the job as manager of the store at the end of the summer. Now, speaking of work, now I need to say a few things about my husbands job.  Chris works for a trucking company that delivers to Houston from here in Waco.  Right now, the place where they deliver to is running slow and instead of cancelling drivers, the foreman still has all the drivers running.  So, instead of having a 10 hour shift it's more like 12 or more. Plus the other drivers have this nasty little habit of stealing things out of the other trucks.  Each driver is suppose to have their own mallet to bang on the truck (they deliver powdered limestone).  Now someone in the company has stolen four mallets out of Chris's truck.  These mallets aren't cheap, they're like 20 to 50 dollars each, depending on which mallet he gets.  So, now we're out of a mallet once again.  This one, I swear if it gets stolen again, heads will roll.  But of course, Chris says that he will beat the person who has the mallet, then I'll have his head on a platter.  Is that wrong?  But it's really getting on our nerves constantly having to pay for another mallet.   Ok, to some up, my husband and I have issues.  LOL

      For those of you who don't know...Texas alcohol Beverages Commission.  They are out in force this week.  They hit a sister store last night, and let's just say, the regional supervisor, Becky, is pissed.  Let me paint the scene...a young looking person walks into the convenience store, grabs a beer and stands in a long line of people to purchase said product.  When it's their turn, they ask for a pack of cigarettes.  The cashier too busy to look up and notice the person looks like they're 15, rings up the beer and sells the cigarettes to said customer.  A minute later, two police officers walk in and arrest cashier on the spot of selling to an underage consumer, aka- sting operation.   So, first thing this morning I get a lovely phone call from the regional supervisors girlfriend telling me about the whole thing and "to be forewarned".  My first thought was, I don't have a TABC license.  I need to get one, since day one, I've been told that I need to.  So, 5 1/2 hours later, Becky walks in and asks me if I've got my license yet..."Nope, don't have time to go down to the place and sit for 4 hours to get it."  She in turn gave me this lovely little web address to take it online.  So, after getting off work, I sat myself down in front of this contraption and proceeded to listen to a monotone voice read to me for 4 hours.  Afterwards, I had to take a test to see if I had in fact been paying attention.  After answering 25 questions, I find out that I only missed two.  Just my luck, always miss two, can't be perfect, never perfect.  But I passed all the same, and now if I sell to minors and drunks, I will go to jail and and become someone's bitch for the night or two.  I really don't know how long they keep you in jail for that sort of offense.  All I know is, that it stays on your record and then if you go get another job you have to explain why you have a class D misdemeanor.  Which I really don't want to do.  Seeing as how I had a juv'y record- couldn't keep my fingers off those lighters.  Did you know that a 3 foot Rubbermade trashcan can melt to be a foot tall in only 5 minutes?  See, you learn something new everyday.   As for me, I'm heading off to bed.  I've been up since 4:30 this morning and I'm tired.  Got to go back to work in the morning...oh joy.

         In my subtle way, I've finally decided to push back.  With a quiet voice added with a smile, customers wanting certain cigarette products will purchase what I offer.  For instance, a woman came in all, "I own this joint." attitude, asked for Doral Lights.  I put on the counter, a soft pack- she asked if we had it in a box- knowing full well that we did, I told her nope- not this week.  Then her boyfriend asked for another brand- I carded him. Or at least tried to- he didn't have his ID on him, the whole scene pissed off this woman to no end.  But did I care?  Nope!  I rather enjoyed it.    It's gotten so bad that when I came in today, Kevin had put a note above the register stating:      Our lines are like HEB or Wal-Mart.  We can and will only wait on one customer at a time!!     Which after reading this message, my co-worker Sheri, told me that people have been throwing their money onto the counter instead of waiting in line.  So, as a result, we can-politely refuse service.  Which I could have done from the get-go, but anyone who knows me, knows that I'm very patient, so I do put up with a lot.  Funny thing is, as a child I didn't put up with anything.  So,now, I can be a polite Bitch at work and not worry that I'm going to lose my job.    A woman came in talking about our sign.  She said," You're manager is rude."  Why, I asked, because we're tired of being walked on and all over.  She came up with something like, if the customers are being rude, just be rude back- that's what I would do if I was you.  After she left, a few customers who had overheard us talking, started talking about her.  LOL  Kevin wasn't being rude, he was stating fact.  And besides that woman wouldn't last five minutes in my job.  The sign was the main topic of discussion tonight.  It's making the desired effect...make people aware of what they're doing.

         Ever have one of those days that started out good until something happened and now you're wondering what's going on?  That's the type of day that I'm having.  Up until 8:30 this evening, I had a good day.  But at 8:30, I got a phone call.  Not just any phone call, but the person on the other end asked for my husband Chris...a woman.  A woman's voice that I don't recognize.  AND we have caller ID, so I know who called and after looking the number up it is here in Waco and in a part of town where a female friend of Chris's lives.  Now, Chris knows how I feel about this friend.  I had to find out through my best friend that something had happened between them years before I met Chris.  But what gets me, is the fact that she wants to continue this little fling that they had years before, knowing that he's married.  I don't like the fact that she is constantly throwing herself at him, honestly, I hate her.  Truly hate her.  And I don't take that word lightly.  I abhor the word.  But in this case, it fits.  She rubs me the wrong way.  I be nice to her for the simple fact that she is Chris's friend.  But I also know that if I say, "Don't talk to her."  That Chris will do just that, so I have to grin and bare.  But honestly, why should I?  He's my husband, not hers.  Sure, we have problems.  What marriage doesn't?  Come on, this is going too far.  He asked me a few nights ago if I was cheating on him.  Now, I'm wondering if he is on me.  Deep down I know that he isn't, at least I hope that he isn't.  Cause that would mean that he's cheating on me with HER.  Now I'm sitting here waiting for him to come home so I can ask him.  The only good thing is, he's a bad liar.  At least he is to me.  He also has a blog that he just started.  He's made one entry that he doesn't want me to read...then why tell me about it?  You know that if you tell someone not to do something that at the first chance that they're going to do it.  So, I've read it.  And he thinks that we're in a loveless marriage.  what he doesn't see that yes, there is love in the marriage, just not the kind he is hoping for.  He wants the dutiful wife that will do whatever he wants whenever he wants.  And I'm not like that.  He's trying to conform me into this wife, and wonders why I'm shying away from him.  He doesn't think about what I've said, past or present.  He picks and chooses what he wants to hear and frankly, I'm at the end of my patient 40 mile long rope.  I'm having thoughts that I shouldn't right now.  Because I do have obligations here.  I have a job that is promising, friends-true friends.  I have the kind of friends that tell me the truth no matter how much it may hurt.  And you know what, I appreciate them for it.  I'm tired of having friends that lie just to save face.  And they aren't like that.  They are true friends down to the core.  Now, I'm here thinking.  Truly thinking.  What to do next?  I'm not getting through him.  How do I?  How do I get through to someone who doesn't want to hear?  I want to make this marriage work.  For better or worse, that what we vowed.  Now, I'm just waiting for the better part.  I've compromised, let go, and then some.  I'm becoming what I vowed I wouldn't.  Dependent.  I've practically given up my independence for the sake of his happiness.  I've become miserable for the sake of his happiness.  I'm becoming depressed, for the sake of his happiness.  And you know what, he's not happy.  I've given him my all and neither of us are happy.  Sure, we have our good days.  But at the heart of it, we're miserable.  I try hard to keep us together but it seems like he's not evening trying.  It seems like he's just here for the ride and lets me do all the work. I'm tired of carrying the burden.  I'm stressing over this burden.  How much more of it will I be able to handle before I crack?  And when that day comes, how bad am I going to lose it?  I don't know if I can handle a nervous breakdown.  But that's the way I'm heading.  I need help.  I need Chris to help me out before that day comes.

         I've ranted before about customers at work.  Well, today I heard a new line.  A "regular" came in demanding that I turn on the gas pump.  Anyone who has been around Waco has seen the pumps say...Prepay only.  This one is no exemption.  So, if I don't know the person I'm not going to turn on a pump for them.  So, this guy got really upset because I refused to turn it on for him.  "I've been coming in here every morning for years and now I'm being asked to leave something in order for you to authorize my pump.  I don't think so.  I'll take my business elsewhere."  His words exactly.  Why did I remember this?  Because like most people in this town, he got an attitude with me for doing my job.  What did I do?  Well, I looked him straight in his eyes and said, "Sorry, sir, but I've never seen you in here and I work nights during the week.  So, I can't authorize a pump when our policy is, prepay."  Which I said politely and with a smile.  Which by the way pissed him off.  So, we lost a customer.  No love lost here.  LOL  If only I could say the same for all the other idiots who get all pissy because of our store policy.  It's not my fault that gas stations get: 1. robbed the most, 2. have things stolen all the time, and 3. is one of the most dangerous jobs in America.  So, here I am, trying hard to smile and be polite to these people when I truly want to lean over the counter and strangle these morons.     Secondly, I'm tired of the whole fakeness of it all.  My best friend has once told me, that I'm always smiling and cheerful.  "If they only knew."  LOL  Who wants to see a cashier who looks murderous?  Besides, I do want to keep my job.  After 9 straight days of working, I was tired.  Friday was my first day off in 9 days.  I needed a break from the fakeness, from being cheerful constantly.  I needed to be myself.  So for two blissful days, I got to relax.  Be me.  Not someone who seemed to be on Prozac, but me.  If I become a schizophrenic, this is why.  The cheerful one that customers see and berate when things don't go their way and the second one, the real one, that is sedated, subdued.  It's going to be hard if I become a manager.  I'll be fake for 52 hours a week and will probably work 7 days a week.  Now that is going to draining.  The only upside to this is the money.  Being fake for money, is that bad?

      If something could go wrong, it does.  That's what happened on Monday night.  From hitting wrong buttons on the register to stabbing fingers on a rusty metal cage full of cartons of cigarettes.  Good thing that I've already had my shots.  Tuesday was Chris's turn.  Around 2:00, he calls his dispatcher who tells him to take the night off, the plant is closed for awhile.  When he hangs up, he tells me to take the car to work.  Half an hour after I get to work, he calls me up to say that Robert, the dispatcher, just called him in to work.  Dilemma.  What to do?  Find a ride to work or tell Robert that he has no way of getting to work...he chose the second.  Granted, we do need the money, but it's stupid really.  Call him off then turn around and call him back in at the last minute.  But that's his job.  Robert needs to retire, the old forgey doesn't know what he's doing.  But that's neither here nor there.   Tuesday, I had to get my lazy butt out of bed at 8:00 in the morning after closing the night before.  I got home a little better midnight and went right to bed.  I had to be up and coherent at such an ungodly hour, just isn't me.  Health Department demanded that we all take a food handlers class, so Tuesday Sheri and I went to the class.  Needless to say, I tried so hard to stay awake.  Now, instead of going home and taking a nap before work, I stayed up.  Energy pills are my best buddy in trying to stay awake.  It's hard to work while tired.    Signs, we have more signs now at the store.  One says the hours, located on the door at eye level so everyone can see it.  The second one, an open\closed sign.  According to Kevin, he's tired of people pulling on the door while we're trying to close.  Personally, I've just ignored them.  Tuning out what I don't want to hear is something that I've learned to do when I was five.  A pure childish talent that has stayed with me.  It works though.      Thursday, Chris got a third speeding ticket.  Now, the company he works for can't keep him for insurance reasons.  So, until the insurance drops him, he can work.  But after that, he's a goner.  He needs to get another job.  The thing is, we just got a loan get a car.  Since our friends are leaving in a few weeks, we needed to get a car.  We haven't gotten it yet.  Still waiting on a friend of Chris's to get back with us.  But all in all, we're screwed.  If he doesn't get a job real soon, he's going to be unemployed and I'll be taking on the responsibility of paying for everything.  How stressful!!!  So hopefully all will take care of itself and no stress will bother me too much.    Stress...stress...go away...far away...out of sight...out of mind.

         Firstly, today has been by far the worst in my life.  I've had some bad ones, but this one seemed never to end.  Ok, here it goes.  Around 4-ish in the morning, Chris comes home and starts talking to me, what he said, I really don't remember.  Then I sleep really bad, since my back hurts constantly now.  When I finally get up, around 12:30 to do a load of laundry, it was also with a headache.  Not a good sign.  Chris gets up around 1:30 saying that he couldn't sleep.  So, we have another talk about money and bills.  Not a good combo...especially around the two of us.  Anyways, Chris exploded over a comment I made about my personal feelings then got up and left to run a few errands.  A few minutes later, I went off to work.  Work was fine, I was constantly busy, cleaning and what not.  Here's the thing- I was sweeping the parking lot right in front of the door.  After taking care of what customers was in the store, I stepped outside and continued sweeping, when all of sudden I hear hysterical laughter and the door opens.  When I turn around, two college guys were leaving the store each holding 2 12 pack cases of beer.  What do I do?  I scream for them to stop and run after them.  What about the broom I was using?  It stayed in my hand.  So, here I am chasing these two guys still holding this broom.  I swing out of miss one of them, might as well use it as a weapon.  But they get away.  I run back into the store and call Kevin.  Now, I'm getting hysterical...never having this happen to me before.  You know, you're told don't chase just let them go.  But in the heat of the moment, stopping and not chasing is the last thing on your mind.  You're thinking, or at least I was, hey they're stealing from me...go get it back.  So, I'm telling Kevin what happened.  What does he do?  He laughs when I tell him about running still holding the broom.  "I'll watch the tape just to see that!"  Granted now that it's in hindsight, I laugh.  I would like to see that myself.  Me, running across the parking lot holding a rather huge broom.  I joked with Kristyn saying that I should be called...WWT.  The Wicked Witch of Tommy's.  She laughed.  At least now I can laugh over it.  Before I was so shaken up over it, that I couldn't do anything for a few minutes.    But the good thing is,  Chris said that he was sorry for what he had said and did.  Which I love him truly for.  It's a big step on both of our ends to have any cross words.  And, I got to right off the beer, at least it's not being taken out of my check.  And since it was caught on tape, maybe we can find them and make them pay.    Lastly, when I closed tonight, I couldn't get the lock to work.  After all that today, I couldn't even get the door locked.  After playing with it for a few minutes, I got it to work, and left two messages with Kevin about the whole thing.  Which after today I won't be able to forget it.  Between telling Kevin, and he'll tell Becky and probably show her the tape.  Everyone at work will know and laugh, then there's Kristyn who will never let me live it down.  I'll be taking this one to the grave with me.  And on my tombstone will read:  Here lies Jennipher...may she and her broomstick rest in peace!!

      I bought a paper today.  Which I don't normally do, but since Chris will be losing his job soon, I figured why not.  So, here I am, reading the paper since I don't have any customers to wait on and so forth.  When I come across an article about the Presidential race.  Normally I would bypass this.  Seeing as how it was about slander and races are all about slander.  I wish they would stop doing that, and go back  (if they ever did) to the issues.  Anyways, what caught my eye was that it was saying that President Bush and his cronies are slandering John Kerry unlike I've ever read or seen before.  They have a 77 second blurp on a website using Hitler's face and talking about John Kerry and other running-mates...this is from Bush's own camp.  I mean, come on, why use Hitler?  That's really overstepping the boundaries right there.  No one wants to see that stuff.  What respect I had for Bush and his camp, I've lost.  I can't believe that they would go that far, just to win presidency.

      Well, for starters, I really don't want another day like today.  And after talking to Chris, neither does he.  Firstly, you know when you're trying to get on a road and people drive just so that they are just apart enough that you have to sit and wait for the way to clear.  That's what it was like today at work.  I couldn't get anything done (side work wise) until an hour before I closed the store.  I was so busy that for 5 hours it was rush, rush, rush.   For Chris, who just called me, told me that he was in a real bad accident.  Some stupid man who wasn't paying any attention whatsoever pulled into his lane, from the other direction.  And there was another truck behing Chris.  The man hit Chris's side step on the passenger side which sent the little truck that the man was driving spinning...into the other big-rig behind Chris.  The head-on collision, which was at 70 mph, killed the man instantly. I think that people need to re-take driver's ed like every 5 years or whenever you have to renew your license...for that reason.  Most people think that 18 wheeler trucks can stop on a dime like regular vehicles.  They don't seem to realize that it doesn't work that way.  I feel sorry for the man's family, but also, it was a needless death.  If the man had been paying attention, the whole thing would have been avoided.

      That's what it's been like for a few days now.  I work, which seems like it won't ever end, then come home.  My only release from the stress lately has been listening to an audio book.  This morning, Chris calls me at work and tells me that the computer has crashed.  A virus of some sort hit it and now it's back at the store getting worked on.  Now I can't listen to my audio book, since it was on the computer, which has a virus and the book may be erased.  Luckily me...oh well, it could be worse.  It could have caught on fire and burned everything to the ground.  Then we'd be homeless and our poor loving kitty, Sassy would be no more.  But let's not think about that shall we.  That's a little depressing, and I don't want to be depressed.    We got another vehicle two weeks ago.  I know that it's been awhile since I've posted last.  So, let me catch you up.  Two weeks ago, we were planning on picking up a beat up smashed in Firebird or something like that.  The day we were going to get it, we find out the person we were going to buy it from sold it the week before.  So, needing a vehicle quickly, we went (shakes head nervously) to a used car dealership.  There we find, in our price range a 94 Isuzu Rodeo.  Which by the way, I've always a SUV.  Now we have one...YEAH!!!!  (doing a little happy dance)  Live was good.  Now, the SUV if you sit idle too long will start to overheat, or threaten to at least while the AC is running.  So, for local driving, AC used very little.  Long distance trips no problem.  Which we found out last Friday.  We helped Mat and Kristyn move.  The drive back was boring and a killer.  All I wanted was to be in bed asleep but no, we had to drive from out in the middle of nowhere back here to Waco.  But oh well.    That's it for now from the Peanut gallery.

      Kevin put in his two week notice, two weeks ago.&nbsp; His last day was this past Friday.&nbsp; Back on the 12th, when he put in the notice mad drama erupted in the store.&nbsp; Not the fact that he was leaving, but who was going to become manager.&nbsp; Here's the thing...for the past month, I've been thinking that Sheri was going to get the much needed promotion but instead the powers that be waited on telling us who it was going to be.&nbsp; For two weeks, we heard all sorts of rumors.&nbsp; A manager from another location was going to get the position, Sheri wasn't even considered for it, the main Waco office was being transferred to my location, we may be getting fired and all new staff were to be hired to replace us.&nbsp; You know, that sort of thing.&nbsp; Well, the one about another manager is true.&nbsp; I was told Friday...officially, that Loryn was taking over and they totally overlooked Sheri.&nbsp; Everyone at the store thinks...as far I am aware, that Sheri SHOULD be manager.&nbsp; I still think that.&nbsp; I don't like change.&nbsp; And well, this is a major change.&nbsp; Loryn's coming in and changing everything.&nbsp; The new work week doesn't start til tomorrow and you know what...there's not real schedule yet.&nbsp; Loryn told me to "come in at your regular time on Monday."&nbsp; So, I'm hoping that she'll have something up to work with.   Another situation...last Sunday, we had some money go missing.&nbsp; The last one to see it was your's truly.&nbsp; So, when it came up missing to me it felt like all eyes turned on me.&nbsp; I didn't hide the fact that I was the last one to see it.&nbsp; I'm not going to lie and say "nope didn't see", for the simple fact that we have cameras watching the place.&nbsp; And besides, why would steal it anyways?&nbsp; Sure, I need money, but not that bad.&nbsp; I could go to jail for stealing, I'm not going to risk that.&nbsp; I'm not stupid.&nbsp; But the upper management took our lovely tape and watched it.&nbsp; A few days go by and they say that they couldn't see anything.&nbsp; But yet, they tell me that "you stick your hands in your pockets alot and you read the newspaper."&nbsp; Which I did both days...it was slow and I was bored.&nbsp; Anyways, if they didn't see anything about the money then how is it that they could see me with my hands in my pockets or rather, reading the newspaper.   My feeling about all this is, why put someone from another store in my store when the store already has someone who can run it just fine...if not better than Kevin.&nbsp; We'll never know I guess.

      For the past couple of days, I've come to believe why used car salesmen have such a bad rap. In a previous entry, I stated that we had just purchased a Rodeo. Well, on Tuesday, Giles Motors, the dealership, repo'ed the vehicle. When I called about it, I was informed by Nancy, the salesperson, that "my husband is a lying sack of shit and I don't have a chance on God's green earth ever getting my Rodeo back." Now, under different circumstances I would have gone off on this woman. But, I was so shocked that she took my vehicle that all I did was hand the phone to my husband and told him to call her back and handle it. Nancy told us that Chris had stolen a blazer from her company a few years back and now we won't be able to get ours back because of it. Chris has this little habit when it comes to vehicles...pay for it outright, make no payments. That was until now, I figured that hey we'll get a vehicle and start building our credit at the same time. So, with this info, we both know that it's not Chris who supposedly "stole this blazer". And besides, she "can't find the paperwork on the blazer to give us in order to fill out an identity theft report on." Which makes me wonder...is trying to build a file to say that it was him. Make up a place that said that he lived there and forge his driver's license. If that's the case, she's going down. Tomorrow, I'm going to talk to an attorney about the whole situation. Hopefully we'll be able to get something done on that end. Plus, I'm truly hoping that my bank will give us a loan so we can buy this vehicle outright from Giles Motors and take them out of the loop. Seeing as how she won't release the vehicle on grounds that the Bank she uses won't allow her to release it. So, if I can bypass Giles and hoping that the vehicle isn't "hot" I'll have my vehicle back by Monday. When this all went down, Chris had to take the night off so I could go into work. He can have someone cover his shift, there isn't enough people working at job to do that. So, we lost over a hundred dollars in just one night...plus maybe even the vehicle. So, here I'm sitting wondering what else I can do to get this vehicle back. I'm even thinking about a lawsuit for slander against Nancy for what she had said about Chris.  NO ONE TALKS ABOUT MY HUSBAND THAT WAY BUT ME!!! And especially not someone who doesn't even know him. She's going down!!
