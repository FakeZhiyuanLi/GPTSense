      As a student of the humanities, I am often posed the question: "An Arts degree - where is that going to get you?"  Now, the question - where is that going to get you? - implies that an Arts degree is not going to "get" you anywhere.  The person posing the question cannot see an Arts degree being of any help in your life - specifically, they cannot see a commercial application to the Arts and therefore they espouse the concept of Commercial Value being the central driving force behind the concept of "usefullness".  I have now formulated the correct response to this question.  If asked this question or a version of it, take a six inch hunting knife and gut the individual who asked you.  I have no doubt that as they are making what must be a very painful attempt to hold their intestines in place, they will probably ask you a second question: "Why did you do that?"  Your answer should sound a little something like this:  "Well, I have just come to realise that the study of the humanities is an exercise in pointless, useless drival.  As such, following your lead, I have thrown anything and everything to do with the humanities out along with my humanity.  Now, the study of the Arts is the study of human culture, language, history, philosophy, theology and few other things to boot.  It is these core values and ideas that inform, construct and underpin our society including the laws of humanity.  Now, it stands to reason that if it is not going to 'get' me anywhere studing the humanities, then the humanities are an unnecessary hindrance to my life and so, now, after an epiphany brought on by yours truly, I have thrown out anything to do with the humanities so I can become a Commercially Viable Individual.  Naturally, the law 'thou shalt not gut other members of the species Homo Sapiens' is not based on Commercial Viability but on an idea of human worth based in the ideas of culture, morality and ethics as studied and used in the now defunct foolishness of the humanities that you and I don't believe in.  I have gutted you because I need starting capital for my drug empire and I'm going to start with the contents of your wallet.  So you see, it is Commercially Viable and therefore legal for me to gut you."  Then, to stop their screams, I'd advise injecting them with heroin bought with the contents of their wallet.  This has the benefit of getting them hooked on drugs that they have essentially paid for and now you have the beginnings of a client base that will last you for the term of their natural life.  Should you ever end up in front of a judge, plead temporary insanity based upon a delusional understanding of society being a purely Commercially Driven Institution, brought upon you by the insinuations of the victim.  Happy hunting.

      You may, if you want, suit yourself.  Or, you could let me do so and I will never let you down.  We all know that fashion seems to go in cycles.  A la the retro inspired late nineties.  Now, cycles have their ups and their downs.  What is most important to remember is that while some pieces inevitably become stuck in one period while other forms receive little jiggles as they pass through a cycle.  Crack pants (those low cut jeans that took the hip out of hipsters and revealed inordinate amounts of female plumbers crack to the entire population - while a hint of nudity is good, a hint of arse crack is not attractive) have been and are going, forever stuck in the arse end of the nineties.  But the suit, it's a stayer.  What a man needs in a suit is longevity.  Suits cost money so what you want is something classical, something that is going to prove you are a style guru during any particular fashion period.    First of all, I would recommend cufflinks.  Cufflinks give your suit a flavour of old world know how.  Yes, buttons are more convenient but cufflinks tell people that you have an eye for detail.  Cufflinks are a way of individualizing your suit.  Buttons are impersonal and boring.  Also, you will find that a cufflinked shirt sleeve is more comfortable on the wrist.  The cufflink holds the edges of the cuff outward so that the wrist only ever encounters smooth fabric.  Of course, the button does not work in quite the same way.  Any good jeweler is going to stock a credible range of cufflinks in a range of prices.  Understated is the way to go - simple silver, or gold without a great deal of flashy gemstones.  If the gemstone design is simple and understated, then by all means purchase and wear.  You want to avoid a garish display of colour and light that is going to distract attention.  The art of the cufflink is one of a subtle rounding off.  The cufflink is not the focal point of the suit, nor should it be a major highlight.  The very best cufflinks fly under the radar, people see them and recognize that you are a man of style and substance without being slapped in the face with your obvious style acumen.  Cufflinks also make good family heirlooms.  By passing them on you ensure that another generation of men will by masters of style.  Cufflinks give a suit that retro but upmarket feel.  So, avoid the impersonal, inhuman, mass-produced button and opt instead for the personal, individual cufflink.  That wink of silver or gold from the wrist that whispers of class.  That wink of silver or gold from the wrist that whispers of comfort.  That wink of silver or gold that whispers of a man who knows about style and has an unerring eye for detail.  Remember, comfort is not everything.  Price is not everything.  Looking good is everything.

      The Goat is gunting down the Mojo Wire...Latham, Caesar in Waiting, entered the slippery cultural waters of Rove Live last night, a move Johnnie has, according to Rove, never made despite an open invitation from Rove.  Latham is really getting good at pressing metaphoric flesh and he attempted to press himself against every one of Rove's viewers through screen of lounge room televisions accross the nation.  Let's get this straight - Rove is an idiot, yes he got three logies but only fools vote for the logies, his purile humour and harmless interviewing techniques have to be admired for the aptness with which they are aimed at the average cesspit of an average Australian mind.  Occasionally he does good stuff but Corrine Grant's mouth is too big, even if you shoved Rove in there whole it wouldn't shut her up...but the Goat digresses, the interview started well with Latham making cracks about Miriam (a random mexican transsexual who has the tentative claim to fame of appearing on channel ten)and admitting liking to watch one hour of popular television a week and that he used to enjoy Temptation Island.  With pat preliminaries out of the way, Rove began to throw his Patented Interview Curveball's and boy did they really sizzle home.  Latham, though, repeated his arguement for the inclusion of Peter Garret as the candidate for Kingsford Smith - "a person like that is good for Australia if he's in politics as part of the labor partay."  He went on to define himself as a straight shooter who has taken crudity out of his vocabulary and purjured himself a few questions later when he answered - "How will your relationship be with George Bush should the both of you win your respective elections?" with his answer to "what will your attitude to America be if you're elected."  His actual answer to the second question was and I quote: "Well, Rove, as we say in Politics, I've already answered that with the previous question."  Eeeerrr, no, Mr Latham, you haven't.  What you have answered had nothing to do with your personal relationship (and you have been quoted saying some rather nasty things about him) with George Bush.  Latham's "straight shooting" lasted about four questions.  A record in politics maybe but not good enough to escape the eviscerating knife of the Goat.  Ah, yes, the Goat senses more eviscerating over the Garret affair as well but we'll follow that as it breaks.  Latham, ever the young at heart and anxious for all the support he could get promised Rove that he would reappear on the show if he was elected.  That's right, who wants to interview a defeated candidate for Prime Minister?  Latham ignored this little subtext of Rove's question.  The best part of the whole interview occured at the very end.  Rove hadn't really managed to throw a good Curveball at Latham - he'd even forgotten the end of a Latham quote he was meant to use when talking about Latham being a Loose Cannon and foul mouthed to boot.  "A conga line of something - o damn - I've forgotten the word."  Latham promptly jumped in and answered the question.  Rove, however, had remembered by the end of the interview so he thanked Latham for all his hard work on the show and then began to crow - "A conga line of suckholes, that's what you said, a conga line of suckholes."  The fear in the eyes of Latham was extraordinary...the interview had gone without a hitch and rather well the Goat imagines his witchdoctors would be saying but then in one fell swoop, as if Johnnie Howard had possessed Rove, all of Rove's viewers will now remember Latham stuck in his chair while Rove fell about laughing crowing dancing and generally laying the old steel toed boot into Latham's creaking ribs and uttering "a conga line of suckholes, a conga line of suckholes."  Little Johnnie has a really nasty JuJu man somewhere who is pulling strings and contorting complete strangers for there is the lasting image of the interview, Latham burrowing into his chair being forced to grin and bear being told that he'd called liberal politicians a conga line of suckholes without being able to defend himself on NATIONAL TELEVISION.  Ahh, the election hasn't even been called and already the JuJu men and the Witchdoctors are honing their powers for their dark masters whose hands must forever remain lily white for as they all know, Pilate's big mistake was admitting that his hands needed washing, note well that Johnnie has never done a Pilate, he makes other people do that so his hands can remain white in stark contrast to the black filthy grime of his tattered and battered soul.  Stay tuned to the Mojo Wire as more comes to light and the Goat ducks and weaves to the tune of a JuJu man.

      The Goat has digested rumours that Peter Garret is going to deny Kingsford-Smith locals the chance to represent themselves when he is shoehorned into the seat by Latham Caesar of Opposition.  The Goat found it quite hard to chew, let alone swallow.  Isn't Peter Garret the voice of the Real Left?  The part of the Left that will never give up hope of a socialist paradise here in Oz?  No, Peter Garret, should he run with Labor, will be part of the Real Politick, the Pragmatic Left that smells of Blair and Clinton.  Billy Bragg signing up to run with Blair would raise a few eyebrows no doubt.  Garret has always had at least one small toe in politics though and almost made the senate once upon a time.  The Goat muses though...what if Latham can't force Kingsford Smith Labor branch members to accept Garret?  He'll be a leader that can't even knock his own party into line let alone the country, that's what.  Why didn't Garret run with the Greens?  The Greens got a huge boost at the last Federal Election and if they're not going to be a flash in the pan but a real minor party contender surely his "star" power would be an asset?  Ahh, elections, they always bring a whiff of feverish political burning of rubber into the air, covering the land in an acrid haze that no one can escape.  The Machiavellian nature of it all...the throne up for grabs...all the permutations and strangulations...eviscerations, now there's something that belongs in politics, get caught out lying and out come your entrails on national television.  Pollies wouldn't lie anymore, that's for sure...renage on a policy promise and out come the entrails on national television.  Future lies could be predicted by the tangled spools of gut...soothsayers would be back with a vengeance...Politics would never be the same again.  With society unable to read politicians guts for arcane secrets, we have to make do with the mumbo-jumbo of journalism, the soothsayers of the 21st century, the spin doctors have replaced the witch doctors and on rolls the beast.  The question remains, how is Latham going to spin the Garret issue?  The Goat has digested and will now predict based upon the regurgitated contents of his stomach.  Latham will bend, push and if necessary whip his party into line and maybe make a reference to lights on a hill reflecting off Garret's bald head.  The party faithful will once again cop it.  The rise of Garret will continue.  Garret's got a perverse desire to actually be in politics and perverse desires will out themselves eventually.  He's going to make his deal with the lesser of two evils.  His line will be the pragmatic - the ends justify the means.  Latham will retain his title of Caesar in Waiting and Johnnie Caesar will mumble his way through hanging his own staff over tortured Iraqi prisoners to avoid the blame himself while comparing D-Day to the situation in Iraq.  If I'm not wrong, WWII was fought because Hitler's Germany started it.  Not because the Land of the Lied Too and Home of the Bush decided forcibly to remove a dictator formerly supported and supplied by the Land of the Lied Too and Home of the Bush.  [The Goat went on ranting here but really, he's strayed off the topic at hand.  Half an hour later the Goat left International Politics and returned to Domestic Affairs]  Garret isn't fan of the Bush, obviously strengthening Latham's anti Involvement in Iraq stance.  The Goat wonders what the Government will have to say about all of this...No doubt, they will highlight the shafting of the local branch members...mutterings will be made about a lack of substance in bringing in a celebrity even though the Bush has just buried Reagan...and no doubt Garret will hug a tree.  Stay tuned to the Goat on the Mojo Wire hacks...

      It's an Election Year or so the witchdoctors who oversee the political process in Australia tell me and this means that the Goat is coming out of the paddock and into the streets.  The Goat is the only political commentator who eats press releases and newspapers before digesting them and then proffereing his own opinions on to the electorate.  It is a little known fact that the Goat has studied politics once but thought better of it when given a distinction on an essay along with the comment: "Your ideas are interesting but wrong and stop trying to eat my toupee."  The Goat has asked me to write down his political bleatings for the enlightenment of the masses.  Stay tuned to the mojo wire hacks...
