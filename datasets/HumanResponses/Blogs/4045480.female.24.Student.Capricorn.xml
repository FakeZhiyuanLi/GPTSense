						   Well here I go again, another few cents into the ever-growing pile. Today the Chicago Cubs acquired Nomar from the Red Sox in a four-way trade with the Redsox, Expos, and Twins. It was a very complex trade, but in the end Nomar is now a Cub. I'm totally excited about it except for the fact that he has an Achilles problem. The Cubs are just starting to get their guys healthy again, do we really need another awesome player that can't play because he's on the injured list? I really hope Hendry knows what he's getting into, and that we aren't buying another "Casey at the Bat" aka Sosa. These guys better start playing better fundamental baseball, or we'll have to look to next year yet again. But I'm a Cubs fan, I should be used to the "next year" concept by now.  Moving on...the golf season has progressed nicely. Yes I'm a sucker for the PGA tour. I grew up with my dad watching baseball, golf, and football. I could always tell summer was around the corner when we would have golf tourneys on the TV for background noise during dinner:) This year the Masters, which I honor every year by wearing my Masters hat during the tourney, saw one of my favorite golfers, Phil Michelson, win with a fabulous putt at 18. I teared up at that moment, and also when Arnold Palmer, my favorite golfer of all time, made his last putt at the Masters. Yes I am a sap, and yes I cry at great moments in sports. Other than that it's been a lot of watching Tiger Woods fall further into his slump. I think the little woman is wearing him out, hehe. And there have been a lot of unknowns winning majors, a very sporadic year to say the least.  Lastly, there is my most beloved sport of all...football. Yes, training camp is hear folks, and already my two favorite teams are loosing players. The Dolphins lost Ricky Williams, I'm thinking it was the drug problem embarrassment that sent him packing, and if not, that was a shitty thing to do to your teammates, to run out on them, definitely not cool. Then there is Da Bears, as if it wasn't bad enough that my favorite player on the team had to lower himself by dating Paris Hilton last year, but now Brian Urlacher has been put on the injured list. Great, not even two days in and already we have issues. I'm still holding out hope that the Bears have a chance with all the new staff this year, thank god Shoop is gone, but as for the Dolphins we'll just have to wait and see, but I wouldn't want to be Dave W. right now, yikes!  Alright, I think that covers all my bases except for college football, but I've known for quite some time that Illinois is in need of talent, and really don't hold out much hope for them either, but they can always surprise me, or not. I'd love to see all my favorite teams win, but I know I have a thing for underdogs, and I'm okay with that. Until next time...

						   Alright, so from reading my bio you probably could tell that I'm a recent college grad, that I have and am going to again be involved with unionized labor (yes where I come from&nbsp;zookeeping is a union job much like teaching), that I'm going to be a science teacher (chem and bio In case I hadn't mentioned it), that I love nature and the environment (8 years of girlscouts, a major in biology, and zookeeping), and that I am a woman.&nbsp; Put that all together and if you couldn't figure it out, yes I am a democrat.&nbsp; Living in IL I'm happy to see Obama could basically run away with the election because he has no opponent at current time, not to mention he seems to me to be the best man for the job, a very good speaker, a family man, and is a moderate liberal (I'm not exactly keen on the crazy psycho tree huggers that linger too far to the left).   So that all being said, I listened to Kerry's speech today.&nbsp; I thought it was a well played move in the battle for the presidency.&nbsp; He covered all his bases, and of course I liked the part about giving teachers better pay and more respect.&nbsp; Definitely up my alley.&nbsp; I think at this point Bush has his work cut out for him, and that it seems like the election is going to be another very very close race.&nbsp; But it is extremely early to tell, however, I'm pretty certain he'll have my vote.

						   "To see a&nbsp;world in a grain of sand, and heaven in a wild flower, to hold infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour, " -William Blake   That quote is beautiful, and to me, though I don't profess to be a person who is great at analyzing poetry, it means that life is fragile and the littlest things contain some of the greatest mysteries and miracles the world can know.   Okay, okay, I've been watching Tomb Raider way too much, but I love that quote from it.&nbsp; I love those movies (should've put them on the list), and I love how much of a badass Angelina Jolie is as Lara Croft.&nbsp; Another heroine I admire is Wonder Woman, have since I was a little girl.&nbsp; Talk about strong and beautiful women.&nbsp; Though&nbsp;Lara is&nbsp;a bit waify in that movie,&nbsp;and Wonder Woman is a cartoon&nbsp;they give me a body and character image that&nbsp;I wouldn't mind working toward.&nbsp; Sexy, beautiful,&nbsp;smart, strong, observant, ingenious, etc.&nbsp; Okay maybe I just really like these characters way too much, dunno, but I'd take it.&nbsp; Though I know I posses&nbsp;a few of those qualities, I wouldn't mind striving for a body like either one.&nbsp; Although, I am fully aware that they are fiction, and have fictional proportions.   Thank goodness I'm almost back&nbsp;down to my pre-summer weight and fitness level.&nbsp; All those cheeseburgers, pizza, greasy fast food, no more thank you.&nbsp; I'm going to beef up my workout regime, pick out a few more evening classes to attend, and really watch my diet.&nbsp; I'd ideally like to get down another 10lbs.&nbsp;and tone up a bit more,&nbsp;I know I can do it.&nbsp; Right now I do yoga and step aerobics each once a week and supplement two more days of cardio and weight training for&nbsp;two hours per day.&nbsp; I just really need to get a regime I can stick to during my student teaching craziness.&nbsp; &nbsp;That will be key.   Alright enough ranting about my workout plans, I promise.&nbsp; It is just that I'm feeling so excited and ready to focus myself on me and what I want to do right now that I just can't help it.&nbsp; I'm just feeling empowered lately with my new freedom, and all the stuff happening in my life right now.&nbsp;

						   Plans, we all have them.&nbsp; Big or small dreams and goals fuel our souls.&nbsp; Ok, I really got to stop with the goofy poetry , yes/no?&nbsp; Looking ahead I'm amazed how time has flown.&nbsp; I found out the other day that I passed my third of three tests for teaching certification, yeah!&nbsp; So now I'm clear for takeoff:)&nbsp; The plan is to have fun, and to prep for student teaching in the next few weeks, maybe party it up a bit here and there, and then get into student teaching.&nbsp; I'm really excited and yet nervous at the same time.&nbsp; Hopefully it'll be as fun an experience as I think it will, and then it's on to hopefully a full time position with a good school system.   In a perfect world, maybe in about two years,&nbsp;I'd like to be out on my own, have a dog, travel, and just start really living life on my terms.&nbsp; For those of you that know me, you may recall that I had always toyed with the idea of moving to Florida to teach, ya know so I can work part time at my favorite place in the world, WDW of course (that's Walt Disney World for those who don't understand the lingo).&nbsp;&nbsp;Well that dream has definitely lost it's luster.&nbsp; I have to admit, I really am enjoying the city and the burbs much more now than ever, and I hope I can find a nice spot of my own in the mix sooner rather than later, but all in due time I guess.&nbsp; It's just amazing to me because I feel like it's finally happening, I'm finally in the process of growing up, or at least really making strides towards it.&nbsp; I don't think I'll ever fully grow up, who wants to do that, but I realize that I deserve to be selfish, picky, and shouldn't allow myself to ever settle for anything less than what I really want.&nbsp; I think from time to time my self esteem issues creep back up, and I start to settle because I think I have to.&nbsp; The fact is I DON'T HAVE TO, AND I'M NOT GOING TO AGAIN!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That feels good, empowering really.&nbsp; In reality none of us should feel we have to settle for anything, we should push to get everything we've ever wanted, and not allow for anything less.&nbsp; Okay, okay, I'm coming down off my soapbox now.   I think I need to start making my list of travel destinations, maybe get one of those maps and put pins in it showing where I've been and where I want to go.&nbsp; Boy, I'm either a great dreamer with a large imagination,&nbsp;or I just am much more goal oriented and methodical than I give myself credit for.&nbsp; Eh, maybe it's both.&nbsp; Maybe I'll even post it one day, could be fun.   By the way, to all you readers, I know my thoughts can be random at times, but I'm trying to do this more like a stream of consciousness type thing at times, so my advice is just go with it.&nbsp;

						   It's amazing to me how the sun can go down on one part of your life and yet be rising with another.&nbsp; A love is lost, but an adventure is just begining.&nbsp; I wish I could fortell the future, plan it out in a notebook and have it all come out right for once.&nbsp; Nothing is ever perfect, and again I'm left standing here facing a new focus ahead as I have always faced it, as a single, strong, steady woman.&nbsp; I think this time I'm ready, I am ready to start my life, to grow up and experiance all that I can, to see the world, and live every minute to it's fullest.&nbsp; So while the sunset is bittersweet, the sunrise is even more beautiful and exciting than ever before.&nbsp;

						   Okay, so I've been wanting to do this for a while, and I guess now is as good a time as any.&nbsp; This seems so weird, but I've never been one for a handwritten journal.&nbsp; I guess you could sorta say my new embarcation into my new career has really prompted this, either that or I've finally got enough peer pressure.&nbsp; You know the old saying, if everyone jumps off a cliff...&nbsp; Anywho, this blog will in theory be an outlet for me to keep you all updated on life changes, thoughts, aspirations, and generally any crazy or imaginative thought that comes into my head on what I hope to be a regular basis.&nbsp; I guess this is as good a time as any to let you all know that I welcome most comments, questions, complaints, etc, but remember to be gentle;)

						   I am almost offcially too pooped to pop.  I'm really feeling the kickboxing, should've gone to yoga today, but was too beat, though I could've used the stretching.  I gotta be at work a whole half hour early, so I have to make this quick.  Nothing really to report.  Jimmy Buffet is one week and counting, and I may still be able to go to the Bears game this weekend, but I offered the tix to Dubber's fam as a thank you for letting me come to three Cubs games, and feeding me.  It's the least I could do.  If there is an extra tix I'll go, but they get first dibs.  I'm kinda glad I don't have much else going on, I think partying tomorrow night would kill me, I need sleep, especially if I plan to do Step and go to a Bridal Shower on Saturday morning.  That's all for now, no real insights today, though I have many thoughts swirling in my head, not all of them are shareable tonight, still working on some things.

						   You can fill in the above blank, but yeah, I went to kickboxing class today at the gym.  Same instructor as step, and now that she knows me, yeah she pushes me just that much more, but that is good especially for my lazy ass.  I swear, another couple weeks of this plus step and yoga each twice a week and I'll be looking even better, maybe another ten pounds will drop, yeah!  I swear I have a six pack, it's just hiding right now, waiting to emerge.  Awesome workout, although I'm going to feel this the next few days.  The first offical day of school went awesome.  I know not every day is going to be this easy, but I'm even more excited now to get going on this.  Again, still have concerns about classroom management, but it'll all work out.  My CT is planning to turn the reins over in two weeks, yikes!  I'll be teaching for about 8 total, wow, me teaching young minds, look out.  It really is a nice school so far, all the faculty and students, all very nice so far.  Alright, school beckons in the AM, must take my sore body to sleep, night!

						   On a day I would've liked to have stayed in bed, I had to be at work.  I created buletin boards all day, spent most of it alone as my CT(cooperating teacher) had to be downstairs for three lunch periods to recruit baseball players out of the droves of freshmen.  After that, came home, and almost fell asleep, took two asprin, and rode into the city for dinner with a buddy of mine.  Saw his apartment, nice location, and in-house laundry is always a plus.  Got invited, then uninvited to a party friday.  I understand, and really I should be doing other things like resumes, grading papers, planning lessons, sleeping, etc.  Beer doesn't help my head of my figure, no hurt feelings whatsoever.  But who knows, plans are always changing with me.  Oh and yeah my mom was in the hospital today, outpatient surgery, women problems, she's fine and that's all I have to say about that.  However, other friends and aquaintances aren't apparently so lucky.  Leslie, still in isolation, anaphalactic shock due to attempted meds, not cool, but she's doing ok right now.  Through the grapevine I hear of another person, elderly, who's health is an issue, my heart goes out to the family, my prayers are with them all.  My stress level has tappered off a bit, very good, I was getting worried for a while, but I was assured of the normality of the situation by several parties.  I don't think anyone is using the Bears tix this weekend, damn bridal showers, I wanted to go, but alas not to be.  I'll just have to catch the second half on TV.  I think that's it for now.  The students arrive tomorrow, not worried about my content knowledge so much anymore, more so about handling classroom management, it'll be an experience.  I guess that's it for now, goodnight.

						   Well, after a very short week, and weekend I have started Student Teaching. I was so nervous I didn't know if I wanted to eat or loose my cookies this morning, yuck. But it was all pointless, the teachers in the Science department were all very welcoming, including the department chair and my cooperating teacher. Yeah me! I think I'm going to be fine, but the kids officially arrive on Wednesday and that will be the start of the true test. I get to do bulletin boards tomorrow so that will be fun, and we just have some more housekeeping to take care of before Wednesday. Oh and thank goodness for sports and music, leveling the playing field with my cooperating teacher, definitely a plus even if he's a Sox fan. Oh well, serves me right for student teaching on the South side. Goodnight all, it's late and I have another early start tomorrow, TTFN!

						   What a strange week. My one and only week of vacation and it's freezing in August in Chicago. Honestly what will Mother Nature think of next. I had dreams of lounging by the pool studying, hanging with my friends, enjoying summer. Instead I was treated to an extremely early fall. It feels like winter in Florida.  My week really didn't go as planned, but nothing ever does. I spent way too much money, shopping therapy helped me cope with the weather. I spent a bit of time with my sister, which is always good, partied, went to a Cubs game, overall a stellar week. Then what is eating me? Nerves? Yes. Exhaustion? Yes. Barometer induced coma? Most likely. I dunno, I just have felt kind of blah all week. Like I was thinking time would stand still for me or something. Like this week would just magically extend into two, or a month. In college I perfected procrastination, but this is ridiculous. Another busy day tomorrow, maybe I'll get some Chemistry time in, I better, student teaching officially begins Monday. I'm nervous, I think, about more than just starting this. I know I'll be fine, it is just that this is it. No more screwing around, biding my time. I have to actually apply for jobs this month, start teaching, begin what I hope to be a long and fulfilling career. I'm scared I guess. It just seems so finite, so set, so unchangeable, and yet I know from experience you can't assume anything. I think back to the pre-test jitters I have had over the years, the anticipation of new school years, nervousness about passing finals in college, nerves about graduating on time and target, and somehow I lived through all of it no worse for wear. This just feels different, scarier somehow, I guess because I've never experienced anything like this before. I have no real basis for comparison. It feels something like being graded on performance of how well I practice something. After all that's what this is, practice for the real thing. I guess I better get used to it, because in the real world I'll be continually graded on performance of myself and my students. I guess I figured if I avoid dealing with it, maybe I could anchor time to this spot, and prevent the inevitable. I know that is all to silly for words, "time marches on, and soon you realize it's marching across your face." -Dolly Parton, Steel Magnolias. Great flick  In all seriousness, that's really what stopped me from doing what I had been planning to do for weeks, months even. I could blame it on outside forces, lack of opportunity due to time spent doing other things, school, boys, family, friends, work, etc. But all that would be BS, it was all me, dragging my feet, trying to stop time. Now I'm going to have to really be on my toes, constantly have my nose in the book, constantly be reviewing and checking and rechecking. Not that I wouldn't, or don't do that anyway, I've always been a little obsessive compulsive when it comes to things like succeeding in school. And I do want to succeed, and I will, I know I will. Getting there, though half the fun, is never easy, and in my case never without a bit, no a barrel full of nerves.

						   "Save a horse, ride a Cowboy!" I love that song by Big n' Rich, great tune. But in all seriousness, I had one hell of a day. I got to go to the Cubs game today, they lost, but one of my best friend's brothers signed with the Chicago Cubs! And I was there to help their family celebrate, it was wonderful. Our seats were nine rows directly, and I mean directly, behind home plate. Dude I even got to see Bob Hale's '61 Yankees Ring. Talk about cool. As if that coolness wasn't enough the car was parked in the Player's lot, talk about G-rides, wow! I'm really happy for Dubber and his family, it's been a long time coming, but has finally happened.  As if that weren't enough excitement, we all had dinner and then I went out with the girls and Paulie:) It was great to have five guys dancing around us and two of them kinda vying for me. Danced on the bar with the girls, had some low carb booze, had guys all over us, and just had a blast. Definitely a great day. Oh and two possible set ups, not from the club this evening, but friends of friends, so that rocks. If anything, free dinners. Alright well I'm exhausted and I have step aerobics at 8:30AM. Goodnight!

						   Yep, mid-way through my week off. Took the parents and youngest sibs to the airport this morning. Off to Vegas without me, but it's ok because I'm enjoying my week off. No craziness, no hassle, I just wish it was warmer so I could bask in the sun and enjoy the pool. But it's August in Chicago and we're having a record breaking cold spell, I swear I wanted to go pick a pumpkin out today it was that cold.  I did get a case of the blahs today, I had to get out of the house so I got in the car and drove. I wasn't hungry, but I needed something. I found myself pulling into the local TJMaxx, and had some shopping therapy, and then went to Cheeseburger in Paradise with KJ and on to see Anchorman, funny movie, probably not his best but it worked. I dunno, maybe all this stress about school and work and sick friends was finally getting to me.  And I can breathe a sigh of happiness, MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IS BACK ON!!!! Yes, I am a huge football fan, and I love Monday Night Football, even when I don't care who wins. Pre-season Bears are just around the corner, yeah! I don't think we are going to win this year, just be better than last year. A girl can live without a man, but she can't live without her football.

						   Ok, well not really, but I'm back on the wagon. Yep, I'm starting up my diet again, and kicked off my workout regime for the season with some Express Step Aerobics, I'm ready to rock. I thankfully am back down to my original weight before Key West, but I want to get even further down, more fat loss, leaner muscle mass, etc. So I'm heading back down to South Beach, it worked once, so I'm doing it again. This time I'm shooting for more dramatic results, upping my cardio, and adding in some yoga for stretching and toning, and will probably add in some body pump to get the weight training in. I'm excited about it.  Then there is student teaching, still nervous, still really am procrastinating on the studying part. I really don't know what I'm in for I guess. I'm sure it's going to be a constant review session for me, especially when I actually have to start the teaching part. I know I'll do fine, just there is a lot to do outside of it as well, applications, seminars, and my life too. I'll be interesting to see how I weave it all together but somehow I'll manage, I always do. That's about it for now, TTFN!

						   Ok, so today I did absolutely nothing.  Well maybe that's stretching it, I don't feel like I did anything constructive.  Yeah a few mindless chores here and there, swam in the pool/sunbathed, and generally had a relaxing day.  The week ahead is going to be pretty busy, but I figured it can all wait till Monday, right?  Ok, well that's about all I have to say today.  No new updates on anything really.  It's all a waiting game for now.  TTFN - Ta Ta For Now.

						   Ok, so my night of fun was dampened. The party was ok, people were nice, and I'm glad I could be there for Pat's birthday. Around 10:30 I checked my phone and noticed a message from my friend Amanda, that another one of our friends, Leslie, was in the hospital. To back the story up Leslie has cancer, and is on I believe her fourth set of chemos in her lifetime. Well these are so strong she has been knocked for a loop. 103degree fever, isolation room, antibiotics for the next five days in the hospital. That's all of what I know right now. Again, not cool, and my prayers go out to her and her family. It just makes you think of how stupid and petty the bs of life is, how fortunate some of us are to only be dealing with the petty in our lives, and that we should be thankful for what we do have and not gripe and complain about our lack of things. You only go around once, so you better make it a life well spent.  Needless to say, the party was dampened for me, and I left after about an hour more. It just wasn't fun anymore. The drunks were also starting to get political, never fun, but when you're dealing with so many college students and grad students that's the kind of drunks you end up with after a while. Drunk intellectuals. Not the same party you had in high school or in the early college years.

						   Ok, so last night my phone goes off at like 2AM. I'm half asleep and not coherent, and I fumble for this thing in the dark with a bunch of new crap everywhere to bang into. I grab the phone to shut it up, and don't realize it is actually a phone call at this point. I open it, and read the name, it's says "ex's cell", two things run through my head, first, I thought I deleted his number, and second, this is an actual phone call, so I hit the end button. I didn't want to talk, I know it was a drunk dial, and the last thing I need is him giving me a bunch of bs over the phone, I got enough of that before the breakup, I'm moving on, don't need the drama, thanks but no thanks, really.  So I hung it up, and turned the ringer to silent, I normally don't like turning my phone ringer off for emergency purposes, but I wanted to sleep and I'll be damned if I was going to let him wake me up again, definitely not worth it. Drunk dials from my friends are fine, but not from the ex when I need sleep. I just don't want or need the drama, call me crazy, but I've moved on, and I wish he would to. Being vindictive on the phone while your drunk does not show strength. It shows how juvenile and weak you really are. I've got big things going on in my life right now and the last thing I need is him trying to drag me down. I've cried the tears, and I'm done. I don't miss him, honestly I miss the idea of someone, the support that comes with it, the tenderness that exists. When that is gone, there is nothing left to miss.  I was sifting through things yesterday, and I went through all my old pictures, bad bad bad. Went through all the exes, and I mean ALL of them. Out of all of them only one do I still call my friend, and only one do I sorta regret loosing (last college love). I wouldn't call them mistakes, because the funny thing is I don't regret or begrudge any of them. I guess one can say they were all learning experiences, life lessons if you will. Maybe that's why I don't feel the need for the drama, it's over, I'm better for having known them, and I move on. My guy pal from school said something to me Wednesday night that I've never heard a guy say to me, "I believe it'll all work out for everyone, magic, dreams, romance, it will all come to you when the time is right." I've always believed in that, in dreams, magic, romance, imagination, in short that's why I'm such a Disney fanatic. I still believe that, "someday my prince will come." That's why I'm not sad anymore, that's why I don't need the drama, I know that my somebody is out there somewhere and when the time is really right I'll find him, or he'll find me. Until then I'll just keep doing my thing, selfish, yeah, but I have to worry about me first, because nobody else is going to do it for me. Until next time.

						   Yep, still working on the room. Although I'm further along on putting stuff back in, I've got a lot to go. All my financial stuff is now in folders and filed, DVD's and CD's are put away, fish is back in the room, computer and wires are all neat and tidy (these things called cable turtles, awesome invention). Still am trying to find a home for all my pens, pencils, other odd crap. Then I can start on the piles of crap that are still in my room under my clothing, shoes, and pillows. I swear, once this is done I'll be the happiest person in the world. I just gotta remember it's little baby steps. I have to say, I've found stuff I forgot I had, pictures, mementos, etc. And I'm very embarrassed by how many DVD's and CD's I have, and those are just the ones on my desk, not to mention the CD's in my drawer, and the DVD's downstairs that are also mine. I really just want to wiggle my nose and be done with it, sorta like that old sitcom  Bewitched.      I guess there really isn't much more to say today, got a party tomorrow night, should be fun, KJ should be back in town in the next few days, and then there is all the stuff I should be doing instead of parties, etc. Alright, time to finish what I can for the evening, set alarm for step aerobics in the AM, and get ready to keep truckin'. Goodnight!

						   Ok, so my room has officially exploded. I had to take half of my room apart to construct my new desk, made from two huge file cabinets and a desktop from container store. I am now officially in the process of attempting to put everything back, and I'm finding it's not going to be easy. I really don't know how I fit everything in this room for so long, but I'm going to try my damnedest to get it all back in here. At least my DVD's and my computer are set up, although I liked sitting on my bed and talking to people on IM, I think this is better for my posture.  Last night I went out for a classmates birthday, funny thing was it was just him and I watching the Cubs game at an Irish Pub our class has frequented. I was a bit weirded out that I agreed to this at first, but quickly it became two pals chatting and watching the game, whew, thank goodness. I really don't need to be dating a 31yr. old fellow grad student, who was in the Army and has more than a few mental scars from it. Saturday is his party, I'm going to that. It'll be fun to hang with him and a few of his single pals, and some other classmates of mine. I wanted to put this in my blog yesterday, but my bro messed up the internet again, damn porn sites (just kidding, I hope).  I'm hoping to start my studying Saturday, that is if my room is done tomorrow night. It should be, but one never knows. I'm still worried, but I have a week to prep, I think I'll be ok, and of course I can continuously review as I go, but I want it all to be fresh in my mind. I'm excited, finished all of my orientation, and that was a really great way to get started. I don't feel so clueless, just a little. I've been neglecting my workout this week, shame on me, but I'm going crazy with this room thing, and I know I'm going to step aerobics for sure on Saturday so it'll be ok. I just wish I could've gone to yoga today, but I was on a roll with the room. Alright, time for some sleep, tomorrow comes awfully fast.

						   Well, had my second of three orientation days today, one more tomorrow along with my last two classes for the summer. I'm excited, and nervous again. I know I can do this, but I feel I need to prep more. I was watching the newly hired teachers demo lesson plans for us, wow, I really need to step up my game. However, with time and practice I'm sure I'll become better. I just felt so outmatched. I've just got to remember these teachers have had at least a student teaching experience which I have yet to have, and I'm sure I'm going to benefit greatly. If this new faculty is any indication of the teachers I'll be encountering I'm even more excited, they all seem like good people.  I'm already feeling like a week and a half isn't enough time. I've got so much to do, between reviewing subject matter, to going over all my information on student teaching policies, to reorganizing my room with my new file cabinets and desk space, to finding homes for new clothing, getting some maroon and white in my wardrobe, doing laundry, other errands, working out, and finding time for a little fun here and there. It is really going to go by fast. I should really thank the recent ex for giving me my time back, I'm just now realizing how precious it is. A lot of other family and friend crisis are going on around me in addition to my individual craziness, and I'm glad I can focus on them and on myself with the time I have right now. I really don't know if I can spread myself any thinner, but I guess that remains to be seen. I'm sure it's possible, but I'd rather not find out if I can help it.  I felt like complete crap today. I was fine all day until I got home around three, and then I just hit this wall, like I had been out partying' till the early AM, and I hadn't been. It really was weird, I started to feel that spinning sensation, weird when you only have one vodka/cranberry and water, and you were only out for an hour or so. Maybe I'm getting a bit of a cold too and my equilibrium is just off, I have been sneezing a lot, going in and out of freezing air conditioning and hot outside air. That usually does get me a bit sick. Alright, got to sleep, one more long ass day, then it's time for some cleaning, shopping, and studying. Voila! Merci! (had to sit through a basic French lesson today, hehe)

						   Hello again, well today was one long day for me so this is going to be nice and short.  Had my first day of orientation today, went well.  Found out there are six other student teachers in various departments, good times.  Have my second day tomorrow, looking forward to it, still have jitters though.  Had my second to last Qualitative Research class today, other class got cancelled.  Will be happy when it's over and I can focus on other things.  Went out for the twin's 21st b-day, had to take care of my sis, she was/is blitzed.  My bro was just fine, didn't really drink much.  Oh and my tolerance level, quite low, one shot, one vodka cranberry and I was on the verge of tipsy, one more and I would've been on the floor.  Damn low carb diet.  BTW, starting south beach diet again soon, really want to loose another ten to twenty pounds.  I'm really shooting for a sexier bod here,   I think I've picked out a good regime to start a bit this week and next for after school.  Very psyched.  That's all for now, TTFN!

						   From time to time I hear a song I can really relate to.  Being the closet country fan that I am I heard this song "Girls Lie Too" by Terrie Clark and it really hit home for me, and I bet most of you gals will agree.  Here are the lyrics, but you should really get a listen to really get the feel of it.  I can honestly say I've used them all at least once in some form or another.  "So she can’t go out tonight again Her sister’s sick, she’s gotta baby-sit Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good excuse  Now you didn’t hear any of this from me But things aren’t always what they seem Brace yourself, this may come as a shock to you  (Chorus) Girls lie, too We don’t care how much money you make What you drive or what you weigh Size don’t matter anyway Girls lie, too Don’t think you’re the only ones Who bend it, break it, stretch it some We learn from you Girls lie, too  We can’t wait to hear about your round of golf We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall And we like Hooter’s for their hotwings too Other guys never cross our minds We don’t wonder what it might be like How could it be any better than it is with you  (Repeat Chorus)  Yeah, girls lie, too We always forgive and forget The cards and flowers you never sent Will never be brought up again Girls lie, too Old gray sweatpants turn us on We like your friends and we love your mom And that's the truth Girls lie, too Yeah that’s the truth Girls lie, too  No, we don’t care how much hair you have Yeah, that looks good Comb it over like that...Girls lie, too" -Terrie Clark

						   Okay, I know I posted this morning, but that was just because my mind was running overtime. It is official, I have a case of the jitters. Student teaching is only two short weeks away, and I feel so unprepared. Now, I know I know the material, I've learned it over and over at school, but I guess I just want to do well and I think I'm freaking myself out. This is when the what if's start to come out. What if I don't remember stuff? What if I screw up my lesson plans? What if the kids hate me? What if the teacher hates me? What if I'm just not cut out for this? What if...the list goes on. I know I can do this, but I just have always had such high expectations for myself, and for this experience. I can't think like this, I've been looking forward to this for too long to wig out now.  I'm trying to ease the butterflies and stop the knot tying in my stomach. I really am excited, just so nervous, and I know I have a whole group of people in the same boat as me, yet I feel like I'm actually advancing in my life for the first time, and it scares me. I mean, I've graduated college, but I settled into a job with a specific end point, and then took this crazy chance at being a teacher. There is just so much I don't know right now, and I've always hated not knowing. How will I do? Will I be as good as I hope to be? Do I remember as much as I think I do? Will I get a good job? Will I have a job right out of school? Where will I have a job? I just hate having my life so out of my hands at the moment. All I can do is take one day at a time, one class period at a time, and do the best I can and hope I get where I'd like to be. I've never really failed before, and I don't expect to anytime soon. I also know that I have a lot of support from family and friends in everything I do. I just can't help these jitters.

						   Ok, I've been thinking about this for a while now. I had mentioned before that I was going to put together a list of places I want to go, well here it is. It may not be 100% complete, but it's close as I can get for a Sunday morning. I am going to get a map and mark them all down, but for now I'll put them here. Eventually I'd like to take two good sized trips a year, on in summer and one at Christmas break, and fill in with little weekend stuff here and there to get them all in in my lifetime.  Around the World:    Africa-the place I want to go most, safari in Tanzania to see the Serengeti, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Ngorogoro Crater, Masai Mara, I also want to see Zanzibar, Egypt for the pyramids and the Nile, South Africa  Seychelle Islands-apparently they are Eden on Earth according to my zoogeography teacher from college  French Polynesia-Bora Bora, Bali, Tahiti  Asia-Cambodia to see Anghor Wat, Thailand for culture, China for the Great Wall and culture and the new Hong Kong Disneyland, Japan for Tokyo and Okinawa and Tokyo Disneyland and culture  Mexico-Cancun again, Riviera Maya for Tulum and scuba diving, Cabo San Lucas, Puerta Vajerta, Manzenejo, maybe Acapulco and Mexico City  Galapagos Islands  South America-Peru for Macchu Picchu, Brazil for Rio de Janeiro and where the Rio Negro joins the Amazon River  Costa Rica  Canada-Banff National Park, Nova Scotia, Niagara Falls  Australia-Sydney, Great Barrier Reef, Ayers Rock, the Outback  Monaco  Spain-Barcelona, Segovia, the aqueducts  Italy-Florence, Rome and The Vatican City, Venice, Tuscany  France-Paris, EuroDisney, French Alps, D-day memorials  Great Britain-London, English countryside and Stonehenge, Scotland and St. Andrews Links, Ireland  Denmark-Copenhagen, Fin the birthplace of Hans Christian Anderson  Caribbean-Bermuda, Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Caymen Islands, Jamaica, any and all the islands in the area     America the Beautiful:   Hawaii-All the islands and important spots  Savannah, GA  New Orleans  Washington DC  Atlantic City  Cape Cod  New York City  Boston, Fenway park is a must  Cedar Point Amusement Park in Ohio  Nashville  Mammoth Cave  All the National Parks-Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Mirror Lake, etc.  Mt. Rushmore  Alaska  San Francisco and Napa Valley  Coronado, CA for the Hotel Del Coronado  Phoenix and Scottsdale, golfing a must  Denver  Austin, TX  Door County, WI  Out West on a train   I'm sure there are more, but I think this will suffice for now.
