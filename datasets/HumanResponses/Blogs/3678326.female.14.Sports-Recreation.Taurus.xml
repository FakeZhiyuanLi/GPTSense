           Tom Felton is one of the most hottest guys in the world! In my opinion. He is hot, smart, and can act!    He played in all 3 Harry Potter movies as Draco Malfoy. But the latest one was by far his best. Not only was he a coward and cried in the movie he was a bad-boy. And everyone that knows me knows that I love bad-boyz!    If only he was a skater....Then I deffinently would know we were meant for each other.   I am known in the fangirl society as the Tom obsessor. That name is clearly true by all means.  Are you a Tom fan? Post and tell me what you like about Tom!!!

         She’s young, pretty, and show’s no cleavage. (Which means she is not slutty like other pop stars.) Jojo is the newest pop star on the scene and she is awesome. With her fist single- leave (get out) she is makin' thousand’s of people across the United States dance in their seats (if not get up and dance!)   Thank go she is not another Britney or Christina. God knows we don’t need another one of them.  Jojo is one of the best singers of our time right now and she’s only a teen. Note: She didn’t sleep her way into the business *cough* Britney * cough* Christina * Cough*. She made it on pure talent. Keep it going Jojo!!!!

        More like Spice Girls never? Sure they were a hit in what 1997? But it's 2004 people and The Spice Girls are old news and washed up.  Not to mention they were horrible singers in the first place. There lyrics made no sense and they were giddy lil' British pop stars that thought they owned the world.  They even made two movie. Both were utterly ridiculous and lousy and had no point at all. It looked as if they woke up one morning and decided to make a video. Personally I think Posh spice directed the video. I mean who else could make a video that bad? No one.   The Spice Girls are a disgrace to American and British culture. They put Britain to shame when the released their music and Frankly Britain will always be scared by there horrible voices and there so called dancing. Both in which made me want to hurl.  I personally think we should bring back the witch trials just to burn these 5 girls and burn them at the stake. For they have dirtied this world far beyond clean up and damaged children's minds. Is this what our world is coming to? Spice girls? I think not. Not if I have anything to do with it!
