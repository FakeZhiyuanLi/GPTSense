      mr ibrahim class ends today, he's a nice guy......an eygptian. wish he could stay here but......nah, he got a phd, there is a better future in uk than here. i finally received email regarding the meeting with my supervisor. argh, i've done so many things and now they only ask me to bring along my proposal and only start to discuss it. damn, the things i've done these few weeks is wasted. and somemore, the supervisor is now mr trevor, he's good in management but coding......argh.......  i havent emailed lai fun yet......maybe tomolo or day after......dunno, lazy n have to do my project in these few days. i'm not mad to talk about it, just too sad. it's like waking up from a dream.....now i just want to be alone.......i seldom talk to anyone these days and i cant let her know. i wish to let her know how sad i am for wat she did but...it doesnt matter now as she never cares. anyway, i am happy now, no stress.....jus....moody....the things we did last time is only memories.........

      i finally know who my project supervisor is, taufik.....damn....i wish it was khor....argh.....he's a nice lect but too bad. i dunno how tat guy looks like or how he is.....if he is a pain in the a**e, i'll be dead. bless me...  smsed lai fun again, maybe i should tell her wat happened. it's always better tat someone knew something rather than knowing nothing and judging with wat they think and see without knowing the whole story. i dunno if this is really her but she talked and laugh so much tat it's hard for me to be serious to her. she can be annoying at one time and sometimes she can really touched ones heart. maybe i should find someone like her as a fren, at least i don have to stress on how she will think as she is someone who wont think much when it comes to fren.  i have heard some news of my fren, he was someone who is very ambitious person....and he is one of the first of our secondary school classmates to graduate. he's too ambitious, always wanted to have a good job and high salary. he applied for so many jobs and in the end......i knew this will happened but i do not want to hurt his feelings by telling him the facts.   for me, i would like to have a normal life.....find a job, get experience, find another good job, save money for a house and a car, getting married, having kids, buying education funds for them and then....start my own business. hopefully i can do these all..........haha......

      very 'free', i have settled all my things....now i can really start a new life with my frens. i think this might be the last time i am going to old town to find my frens. seow teng really looks mean to me, maybe i really did annoyed her but this will be my last time tat i will annoy her.  i was very touched with wat lai fun did, she really helped me with the questionaires and even scared tat she will lost some of it, she photocopied few of them and give them out to her bro and her frens. so now i have extra copies. i dunno how to repay her, she don mind but i mind....it's hard to find someone like her, especially someone this pretty and kind. and somemore, she will do the things tat she promised and help others without thinking much. she is kinda sarcastic sometimes and talk alot but after awhile, she's....er...quite ok if u can bear it.  yeah....so now i have finally finished my questionaires.....no more going out but staying home for design and codings....damn

      finally receives a reply from kuan yee....asked me to sell my ideas, the final yr project to hotels. yeah, seriously, if it is implemented in hotels, it will somehow will increase the hotel annual revenue. i'm not bragging, there are this culture in malaysia tat the ppl here are afraid of trying new things. since hotel requires interaction with the staff, most of the guest are not willing to try the services available or do not know wat is available in the hotel, has a market for this application and then the hardware and software are simple, as long as there is a server, client, and a network, it's done.   now i will try to finish the project on time, then see wat i can do about it. hope i can sell this idea to anyone who is willing to buy it. i don mind about the money though as long as it can change things. yeah, i do wish about the money, but too bad, i get this idea from  urlLink techtv .  i am so bored and i wan to learn something. i tot of music instruments but most of the thing i knew is not tat popular among the ppl here...i knew how to play drum (bass and tenor) and flute. i wish tat i could learn piano or guitar. i was very very regret tat i didnt continued my piano lesson when i was.....i forgot, but i remembered tat i learn it before i went to the kindergarten. now i forgot about it....not only piano but swimming too, i learn until the butterfly and then i had to stop....financial problem. hmm......money....it's important but.....nvm......        btw, i finally knew tat i can use html for this whole site.....nvm, i'm too lazy to do those sophiscated thing...javascript.........shit.......i hate internet, all mixed up with stupid standards. too many standards.....

      i still havent get my spec yet.....damn, they said the machine broke and so is the lens, it's their 55th branch and this matter happens? argh.....focus point? think they really have to focus on their point of opening so many branch. wat i am worried most is tat the frame will get damage.....cant they hire someone who can really do the job? i saw the opticians, its a m****, never concentrates on their jobs and this is wat they always do,lazying around waiting to be fed.   i went for class today, new lecturers from uk. he's a nice guy and i like this subject.....it's quite interesting but it is hard for some. to me it is ok.....i got a credits for diploma and distinction for higher dip for this subject. it's system development and management though...haha...none programming but need analytical skills alot to figure the problems of a systems and how to solve it. but one thing for sure is that there are no perfect system, only the best solutions for the problems.   after so many weeks after tat thing, i tot i am still will be feeling down but i wasnt. i still can chat with everyone, jus tat sometimes i am a bit quite. but wat i can say is tat i am 'free', no stress or worries on how she thinks or felt. never had this feelings for a very long time and i think i like it though. maybe i should have done tat long time ago......maybe i should start to be a positive person. wont change for someone..if they can accept me for wat i am then good, if not, i don mind and i wont change myself to suits her.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   Love can make you happy although often times it hurts.But love is only special if you give it to which it's worth. Bottomline : If you found someone who truly appreciates you, she deserves more of your love.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  maybe i look better if i smile more. hehe...seriously.......maybe i shouldnt be looking so cool to anyone which i am not familiar with. hah.....havent heard anything from my sis about her colleague. but one thing for sure is tat she sometimes did ask about me and tat day she even ask my sis to intro me to her. no kd, ok? she saw me when i was waiting at dunkin with my grandma. anyway, i wont think so much as i know my family will not allow my sis to intro her to me. hehe.......nvm....  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  and next month, we are going to celebrate yvonne birthday, we have never celebrate for her so hope this yr we can do something for her. it will be a surprise party n i think we will get her a bouquet of roses (she never receives it before). hope she will remember this birthday though....sometimes i wonder why there is no guys who are after her, she is quite pretty, tall and most importantly she is a good girl. but too bad, she older than me...haha...but then i feel really confortable with her though cos we talk nearly everything except personal things. hope we will have a great time, it's nothing more better than seeing someone smile/happy for wat u have done for them. this are the things money cant buy for anything else, we can ask yvonne to use her card......haha.    p/s if there is any good looking, caring and good guy, pls contact me.......otyew@hotmail.com. rich or not, is not important, a good future/career is enough....haha...she will kill me if she knew about this. and btw, only over 30 ok?

      i tot of getting my specs today but that idiot broke the frame. too delicate n light....haha..serious. have to get it tomorrow, hope they will replace the new one or i wont take it. i was going with my mom as she had made a new one too. she got it and my one wan 'in the process'. then we waited and she chat with the salesgirl. she look so matured but from wat i think, she is younger than i do. she studies in tar, lives in pahang n taking..something like chinese literature thing....i duno. yeah!!! i guess guys will always look younger than gals, no wonder they said tat guys life starts at 40.   continue.... i guess i have to end the 'story' here. i dunno wat we are now, fren or enemy? i dunno but one thing i know is tat we're not enemies. but i don really wan to talk or look at her, not tat i'm mad but i jus cant face someone like her. watever happens, i still care for her n i wish her to be happy always n i have never curse her like some will do.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  this 'story' is quite messed up and lots of grammatical error but i do not intend to correct it though, there are too many things tat i havent put in cos i think it is too long, it is too sad to think about it n most importantly, it's over. i really wish to be with her for the rest of my life but it's over n i wont fall for her again. it's the end of our story, it's a sad ending although there are many things in between. i hope when i start a new 'story' with someone special, we will have a happy ending. even there is so many things happen, i wont let the past haunts me, i'll try but then......i can forgive but i cant forget. i told this to my fren, a japanese gal, we knew each other for a long time.....i tot she will scold me but guess wat she said? hitomi said "i do not know wat happened to u but i know u were really hurt by someone, u should think for yourself first not others". i was touched. maybe she is rite, i should be more selfish. maybe i should get away from here, ppl here are too realistic, materialistic and selfish. i got frens from canada, japan and uk, they were very nice, at least they are sincere to me.   so i should end this 'story', she is over now although how hard i have tried to hold on to her, no matter how much i did to make her touched for wat i have done for her, in the end we still have to say goodbye. i felt sad these few weeks but i tried to make myself happy but for her, from wat i have heard, she does not felt anything. she even tear my bookmark on the book tat i have borrowed to her. it's a self motivation book, '100 ways to be a happy person'. i do not know if she did tat on purpose but from wat i knew, she will do something tat no one will expect. i wont be saying apologize to her n if i do, she will think tat wat she did is rite and will never change. i knew her........she never admit anything if something happened. goodbye........ -The End-

      i was sick cos of my neck, everytime my neck is in pain, i will get a headache, maybe all my nerve got messed up. and i got a new spec, promotion cos of the megasale. a silver and rimless spec, nice cos it can fold by itself.......hehe. but luckily it doesnt cost much as i seldom wears it.  watched the "Passion of Christ"(pirated version), i dunno how to say about tat movie but i can say it is cruel. i forgot much of it as i didnt read bibles for yrs. no one will ever think tat these thing can happen but it did. but although He knew tat He was going to die (crucified), he will pray for his enemies. one thing tat i don understand is tat y until these days, ppl blame Judas but not the Romans? it's the roman tat torture n kill Jesus....judas jus tell them where Jesus is for 30 silver coins (is money tat important to someone? there are things tat money cant buy, a true frenship and a messiah). too bad the stupid govt does not allow tat movie....maybe it's a good thing, at least there will be less ppl who will knew wat the jews did to Jesus.   continue..... she went to hk and i wish she will only be back after valentines day cos i knew she will not let me find her. i am kinda dumb, sometimes i would rather dunno anything, not tat i cant accept any bad things but i do not like the feelings of losing something. on the next tuesday, she msged me n told me tat she is already back home. i asked her when she is back and she kept avoiding tat question until she finally gave up, she came back since the last sunday. it was hard to accept tat she didnt find me even if i already asked her to msg me when she arrive home. and i wish she never went there as i know she will be a changed person if she sees new things. i cant control her but i jus wish she can remain the same.    vday is coming fast, i wish to celeb with her but i knew tat she might not want to go out with me. i smsed her to ask her out but she never replied me at all.......it was sad when she is kept avoiding me. and finally on the thursday, she smsed me, she said we were just close frens and sorry for making me misunderstood. i called her fren to ask n she didnt help much. she suggested to me to try to call her, i call her hp and home. she doesnt want to answer my call. i was so sad tat she still do this to me. finally she answer n she said 3 things to me tat really makes me really dissappointed n really sad.    - "the things i've said is all jokes, i have never imagine tat u take it so seriously"   - "these days i oso find ur fren, we even sms each other alot"   - "do u think u're the only one i go out with? i also went out with other guys"    it's like being stab rite on ur heart. watever i have believe in is all lies. i was standing high and within one day, she push me down. i have fallen and i will never knew when i can stand back and start to trust ppl again. i have don so many things for her, money, frens and etc, not bcos i wanted to have her but bcos i wanted her to be happy. maybe some might think tat it is nothing but it is everything to me  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   To the world, u might be someone but to someone u might be the world   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*    one cent doesnt mean alot to some of us but to someone who does not have anything, it means alot. they will never understand how i felt. i always thought tat if i treat her good, one day she will do the same to me but i was wrong, she kept lying to me just to get my sympathy. i really treat her with all my heart but she still treats me the same but at a different approach. i wasnt mad but dissappointed......how can she said those things to me? it's so cruel, even 'ah wong' dad said tat "r u a human for saying tat" to jessica hsuan (she said "i never ask him to do tat for me").    her fren said tat she is protecting herself, but at a cost of a frens feelings? does it worth it? i really do not know n i will never know. from the first day i knew her, i wish to make her happy n try to make our frenship last as we have been icq and emailing each other for yrs. i have tried so hard to make our frenship last...i really treated her as a fren after she first rejected me until few month ago, she gave me some hope. she even asked me "WHAT IS HOPE?". how can she said this to me? after 4 yrs, does time or frenship means anything to her?     now, i will never get angry with her and i didnt. i just don wan to see her anymore, i cant face someone like tat anymore...i cant. one might think tat i am 'small gas' but i am not, i just cant face her or even talk to her like last time. i wish i could but i cant. one thing i didnt feel regret is tat i have tried it is her who never appreciates me.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   You will never lose in loving. You only lose in holding back.  Bottomline : Don't be afraid to tell the person you love how much you  love her. Let them know, let them decide and make a decision.  The best thing in life is to tell the person you like/love how important they are to you, by doing so, you feel liberated. And you are proud of yourself because you are responsible to your own feelings. Never betray your own feelings, because you are the only one who will suffer, no one else.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*    after this incident, i found out tat there are still ppl around me who are still cared for me. i think from now on i should concentrate on wat i have missed these few month and appreciates ppl around me. K has been there for me in these past few weeks although she had a bf. some knew wat happened and they had been supportive to me as wat i have did was rite, it was her fault for making these happen.  "no man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, wont make you cry" .  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   Don't throw your back to love when it's already in front of you, don't drive it away from you because if you did, someday you'll think again why you let love fly away when it was once next to you.  Bottomline : Treasure the one who loves you, it's not easy to find a person who loves you. It's always more valuable to have a sincere heart.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*    i am over with her and i think i have to go on with my life without her ( "Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you" ). i am really happy to be with her in the past few month and i will remember it for sometime. and tat is why i have to courage to write it all down, i might forget but i will let this blog to remind me of wat happened. i wish to tell her how much i still care for her but she will never listen or care to listen. she still blame me for being 'small gas' but it wasnt about the rejection. it was about the lies she said, i sacrifice so much for her bcos i tot she was lonely n sad n i have tried so hard to make her happy but......it was all her sweet lies.     no matter how i have tried to hold on to this relationship/frenship, we still have to say goodbye again. i have tried so hard, so hard that i am so tired of anything but in the end, we have to say goodbye....   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   It's always better to have found the courage to love even if you lose it in the end rather than never found love because you were too afraid of the challenge.  Bottomline : Don't give up if you face or think that you have competitors. It's always better to try, if you succeed, the reward is more than you can expect. But if you don't try or don't summon up the courage, you might lose the one you like/love forever...   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      damn, power down......my dad turn on so many lights, fan n aircond in the house tat the main cut the power. luckily i have already post the previous blog cos i forgot to add something. hehe......    tat girl, her fren (lf) smsed me in the morning cos i went to her house to help me to get ppl for the survey. it's for my project though, guest request system (grs) sounds odd but better than gro rite? or maybe it sounds better if i rename it to guest request operation system (gro's). if i do tat i am gambling with my degree as this project will decides wat i get for my degree(1st class, 2nd class upper....etc). ok back to the main topic. lf asked me wat happened between both of us but i didnt tell though cos i don trust her yet. i wont easily trust ppl so tats y i kept changing my topic. good eh? but then when i think again, y the hell tat she wanted to know so much when tat day she doesnt want to know at all? million dollar ques, maybe tat gal ask her to ask me about wat i wan to say about her. luckily i didnt. but i will have to find her to get back my things next week, maybe she will force me to tell her but i don think i will say anything though.    actually she's looks good though, like mirriam yeung, the hk singer/actress. she does but not really though but she does looks good, fair, smooth skin (no pimples or anything) and friendly. but her bad thing is, she talk too much and quite sarcastic. some might take it as a good thing but i hate ppl who talk too much, damn annoying and troublesome. from her looks and her body shapes.......ok, i did look at it but not from the outside to the inside, ok? she is fat, not now but last time, she still got some baby fat which i can assume tat she was fat when she was small. but anyway, she is pretty, so...it covers the disadvantages though....haha. but one thing, i really wish we can be frens, a true frens, someone i can share my things but one thing is tat i need to do now is to trust her but it takes time.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart  There's always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      i saw one nice chair at carrefour, i really like it since i saw it at my aunt house, she got it from ikea but at carrefour, i can get it for $130, a lot cheaper and also they includes a leg rest. quite nice but the promotion ended yesterday, now it cost twice as much. hmm.....i should have bought it but i cant afford it, hey, i'm a student, ok? i cant afford a lot of things, after this yr, after my graduation, hopefully i can get a job n buy the things i have always wanted and a new house ;).   continue....   i am already confused and the things i wanted to say is already mess up. ok, during the last few weeks, i accompany her alot. on tat day, she ask me to accompany her to renew her passport. of course, i am happy to do so. i lied to mum tat i have classes tat morning, it was 7 am, i woke up and straight away went to dim sum restaurant and get her some char siu pau, i tot she havent had her breakfast n if i asked her, she will definitely reject me, tats y i get some without telling her first. and btw, i usually wont eat n it was strange for me to purposely get something to eat in the morning, not for myself but for her.       i arrive at her house at 8, i gave her n she does not want to eat it bcos she has already taken her breakfast. it was quite dissappointing though but nvm, as long as she's full. we went to kajang immigration office..it wasnt full at all, luckily but in the end her application was rejected as her IC was expired. in the end, we end up going to pj to renew her ic and when we arrive.....damn....lunch time again.     so we went back to the car and she cried out.....she lost her cheque, her boss cheque. she was quite frantic and nearly cried but luckily i ask her to carefully find it and drop her back at where we parked just now, luckily she found it. if u were there and u see the smile on her face......it was like...it was hard to describe...but i can tell u tat i was happy to see her smile.    after tat, after she is finish settling with the cheque at a bank nearby, we went for lunch. we didnt plan anything but in the end, we went to cold storage (pj) there. there we many restaurants but in the end, we end up at the new sushi king restaurant. i don really like it but she loves to, so in the end we had our dinner there, i didnt eat much although i didnt had anything since morning. in the end, i ate $14 worth of sushis, it was not much around 4 plates. after tat, we went back to the registration dept. and in the end, she finally did renew her ic and got a temporary ic. now she can renew her passport but this time her bro will be taking her. the next day, her bro did take her there, i was going out with my family. tat time, she smsed me, i was happy cos she was queuing up and the one tat she msged is me. but there is more tat she havent told me though, although she can tell me but she purpose do not want to do so. she got her own reasons though not for my own good but her own good.    then chinese new year came, we find each other often, very often and on the 13th, she is going to hong kong with her bro. before she went there, i ask her to get her ic, so i purposely went to pj from ampang just to take her (she lives in pj old town, 10 minutes to the registration dept) to get her ic and few pairs of disposable contacts. she even ask me wat i wanted for souvenir, i was waiting for her to say tat and she did. i was happy but i didnt expect much cos she is quite 'kedekut', too i presume, so i didnt say anything jus ask her to buy her things first and the rest, only have some left then only buy for me. am i dumb to go so far jus to take her when she can easily get a cab there but i think it's worth it cos i can see her and i am the last person to go out with her..i think. continue.....

      wat i did today? hmm.....basically nothing, just went to midvalley and had dinner at mr ho fine dine, with my grandma, mom, aunt and cousin sis. not bad but quite expensive though. yeah, i like the pig knuckle, like 'siu yoke' crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, not bad.     after tat, we wait for my sis to get back home. she worked there. and later, she told me tat her colleague wanted to know me. hehe. my mum heard tat too, i was happy and i don mind of knowing a new fren though but both of them warn me not to cos......nvm, it's not nice to said tat. not my problem though but then i do not mind knowing a fren.  continue.........   guess this is getting closer to the end. hmm....sometimes ppl think tat if u treat someone good, u are doing tat for one reason which is to get her as ur gf. but to me, it's not tat important, maybe i'm lying but it's true. i even does tat to my frens, and if they are happy for wat i did, i will be happy for them even if they do not thank me sometimes.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Don't be too good, I will miss you. Don't be too caring, I might like you. Don't be too sweet, I might fall for you. It's hard for me to love you when you won't love me after all...  Bottomline : A person who makes me loves him/her is actually a person who loves me more than I love him/her. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*    then after this new yr eve (2003), we go out often n i thought of confessing to her one day cos i cant find a good time to confess to her. we knew each other for nearly 5 yrs (1yr++ on the net n 3yr++ after we met) and i was trying hard to keep this frenship to last and after these few yrs, i really wish tat we can be together. i don mind about her family and her (looks and attitude) cos 4 yrs, it's not short n it's not long, i really wish to be with her. i even continue to my finaly yr to get a degree to earn more to support her cos i know she spend alot. i also planned on wat i will be doing after i have finished my studies, eg buy a house, car for her, open a business and after tat we can spend the rest of our lives togehter.    it is stupid to some but at least i have a goal in my life which is to make her happy and taking care of her. i never told anyone about this though, i even thought of sacrificing my chances going to UK. i was called by one of the general manager of logica synergy (i m not sure cos i forgot)to send in a resume. if i can get the job, i will be working there and earn 2000pound/month(around 13k-14k here). nvm, forget it.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you think something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only once.  Bottomline : Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you back. Give it a try else you might regret later...no one other than yourself knows what can truly make you happy. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*    ok, back to the main topic. during the last chinese new yr, we went out on the 30th, 3rd, 4th and 5th. she find me everyday though but i was with my family and i tried to find some time to go out to accompany her cos she was alone. we even watched the last samurai (i never tot tat this will also be the last movie i will be watching with her). i was bz at tat time n i even lied to accompany her. although we didnt do anything but i was happy. i told my fren, and they asked me, why the hell u didnt try to hold her hand when u have so many chances? they wont understand, i respected her and i knew she will be scared if i do so and i will only hold her hand only if she accepted me. guess ppl will said tat i am a dumb guy. maybe i am......  continue........

      i am starting to do my feasibility studies.....urgh, dunno wat to put in and somemore there is no fixed format for it. argh, talk about standards in IT......too many standards and things are getting mess up. now i'm starting to do my surveys and luckily there are frens to help out as i don have much frens. it's not easy to ask ppl for help as most are not willing to help at all. m'sian are quite realistic as they wont do things without getting something back.   continue....   from tat moment on, we find each other out quite often and she still treats me the same. find some silly excuse to avoid me. sometimes i really wish tat if i treat ppl good, they will do the same to me but they wont. the first yr, it was bad, she treats me the same as last time but everything changes on the march, 2004. she was waiting for her result and trying to get a job. she was bored at home.    during one day, she msg me and ask me for lunch. wow...she never did tat before, somemore, with my classmates. we had lunch and after tat, both of us went out. it was not planned though, cos i was getting my 1 day salary (i work in Prince Hotel Kuala Lumpur). she asked me to accompany her for the whole day, i do not want to cos i don have much money left but finally, i have used all my salary for the money and dinner. but i was happy bcos she is starting to change on the way she treated me but i wont think much cos i am treating her as a fren.     from tat day onwards, she always asked me to accompany her to places and even shopping. i was really having a good time although i have to use a lot of money as i am scared she will mind. i even drove my sis new car to take her everywhere because she have said one thing to me, "if u wan to get a gf, u have to change your car", it was hurt but i knew she will change cos i know someday, tat person will be touched for all the things i have done for them and it is true, her attitude towards me really change.    for the whole yr, although sometimes she is cool towards me, but i am still happy to have her around. we were frens. all i wish is her to be happy and i even wish she will get a bf sooner or later as there will be someone to take k of her. i have never tot of getting her with me but just wanted her to be happy and sincere to me, as a fren. but things changed, i was thinking, why should i let others guy to take k of her when i can take k of her? at first i didnt do anything but she is hinting me alot, i think. this is wat she does and said:   - "where did u go?"   - "are u going out with K? if u don tell me, i cant sleep tonite as i will think about it"   - "who is the gal who use your phone?" *my cousin sis*   - and much more....    wow, isnt tat enough? does she have feelings towards me? she said tat not only once but many times. isnt it great? after 4 yrs, i finally have made a gal touched for the things i have done. now i believe as long as u treat ppl nice, sooner or later, they will be touched. i really wish i can confess to her but i was afraid to lose her if i said tat, tats y i never said.     i treated her nice, not because i wanted to have her but try to make her happy as i know she is sad most of the time. i tried everything n i even sacrificed alot for her compared to anyone. to some it is nothing but to me, i did alot. "to the world, u might be someone but to someone, u might be the world". guess no one will understand wat i have done. i even ask her fren to ask her out on special days as i know she really wish to celeb with her close frens but i do not want them to tell her tat i am the one who said tat. but.....some told her n she ask me not to do tat again in a polite way. one might think i'm doing so to get her but i didnt, i just wan her to be happy and if she does accept me, i wan her to accept me for who i am, not because of wat i did and wat i have. but not only tat they told her but even said tat i am annoying, i admit tat i am but i don mind, as long as they did wat i ask them to. there is nothing better than seeing the one u care, smiles.  continues...........

      Uh...finally finished my economic feasibilities. doing my final year project on a hotel system. i tot it was easy but it is tough. have to do this and that.....damn, wish i just do a small applications.  continue...   and one day, we finally met, i tot she was very very pretty but when we finally met, she is not. thin and lots of acne scarring. but i dunno why i still sit there and enjoy the outing. btw, we were accompanied with one of our frens, so there is 4 of us. i even gave her a $80 musical box bcos her bday is near. she complained about this and tat but i dont mind at all. I still remembered we met on the first monday of June 2000. then from tat day, i've tried to make this frenship last and even fallen for her but she rejected me for the first time. i didnt felt a thing though cos it wasnt serious at all. then from tat day onwards, we seldom went out, getting lesser every month. i really tried to treat her good but then.....she still said those hurtful things to me tat i am......poor. i was kinda dumb cos i don easily get mad so i dont mind at all but i remember wat she said.    after one yr, i have changed to a new college as i cant cope with the stupid calculations in the engineering course. 80% of the course requires u to remember a lot of formulas...duh. the new college is same as hers but in the different side of the building and i told her about it. she called me and suggest tat during my registration, she come along and told the admin that she is the one who intro me to this college(the one who introduce a new student will get $500). yeah, they tried to see if they can get the $500 for her. i was surprised that she is willing to follow me and returned all the money to me.    weeks have passed, and one day i asked about the money. she said the admin is processing and i suggest if they gave the money, i will give 40% to her. months have passed, i ask her again,......guess wat she said? she said she have already used all the $500 and asked me whether if it possible not to return it. i was shocked, how can a gal do this? after all, i tot wat she did is helping me but nope, she was just trying to get the money tat my mum was saving it so hard. wat can i do? ask her to return it? she wont. from tat day on, i tried to forget her......such a gal tat would used someones trust and money to get wat she wanted, MONEY!!     yeah.....i didnt find her for quite a long time after tat. i was having fun in the new college, new gal fren. there is only few though and i only knew two gals. both are quite pretty, friendly and sincere. it really wish i could tell them cos they have changed my life, from a shy guy to someone who dare to talk to a gal with eye contact! they were nice and talkative.......too talkative...even on the in the icq. between both of them, i am only close with prettiest one, lets call her K. she was nice, too nice to everyone till everyone misunderstood, so tats y so many guys in the college is after her. i didnt, i even tried to avoid her cos she was quite annoying n talking too much n always asked me to accompany her for lunch but i didnt. although we met nearly everyday, we only had lunch trice.    as time went by, we are getting closer, sit with each other in every class and chat on the icq every nite for few hours. then gradually, i have fallen for her but i never really tried to court her cos it is impossible bcos all her guys fren were more better than i do but i really treat her very good compare to others and she cares alot for me too and she even scold my frens for wat they did to me. from wat i can say is tat no one has ever treated me this nice, respect me for wat i am, accept me for wat i am although i was quite cool to her and till this day, she is the only one who has ever treated me this nice and respected me for wat i am.     but..........i've never appreciate her cos i cant. i really wish i can court her like the rest but we cant be together cos......i dunno...maybe i think too much. i try to find some small reasons to scold her, hurt her and avoid her but she still cares for me. it hurts but i have to do tat, i am a really selfish a**h***. i felt so bad that even today, when we met, i don even have the courage to look or talk to her at all. and btw, she got a bf, a good one and i'm really happy for her.    then......the starting point of a bad ending....tat gal called me back.....few days before the chinese new yr ends. we talked for an hour or less and she asked me to find her. we went out with my new classmates, all guys. continue.........

      this is the first time i'm writing a blog, maybe i'm too free and boring, nothing much to do since that day. it was suppose to be the best day of the year, Valentines Day. i was scared too as the day is coming closer and closer, as i knew i will only have two possibilities, a good ending or a bad ending.....i would like to tell everyone through this blog but i have to cut it to few parts cos it all started few yrs ago.    hmm......it all started few years ago, in 1999, when i first had an internet connection on my home. it was like..having a new born, happy. during the first few month, i was trying to figure out how things work and then my life changed when i was introduced with the chat programs.....ICQ. it was like.....wow, finding frens through the internet? seems impossible but it is possible. thats the starting point of wat has ended before the Valentines day.       i knew her through the internet, i was searching around and the i saw her, we chat, it was short but nice. she was available at tat time. after tat, i didnt see her often for few month, cos.....she had her first bf(maybe first....i'm not sure) n in few month, they broke up. tats when our things started.    she was finding me to console her, and i did, i tried to talk to her(through ICQ though) and we even started emailing each other. we talk alot and she even gave me her number but i do not dare to call her as i was very shy. after talking and emailing each other for nearly a year, i finally found the courage to call her n even met. it was short conversation though as i remember she was having her lunch. continue.........

      this is my second blog......i cant sleep, so check wei hoong things at friendsters......hmm.......guess he seldom contact our ex classmates. i am at least better than him, i still contact with kuan yee. hehe...  and checked reginas too and......i could see tat she got lots of frens, gals and guys too. i guess it is a good sign, many frens esp guys, so still got chance for her to find some potential bf.........hehe.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   i still remember the first time we met, she ask me to met her at midvalley but i kept giving excuse cos i was scared n i do....but in the end, we did met with ming tsong along. hehe.......he kept asking me how she looks like, then he said, if not pretty, we ciao..........  then.....we arrive, and we met at mcd, i was so scared tat i wanted to cancel it but......in the end, we really met. i kept speaking in cantonese and she kept speaking in english. then ming tsong was looked confused and in my head, i was thinking, y she kept speaking english when i was speaking in cantonese? tat is one of the funny thing.  next, ming tsong wan to stay and have lunch together with 2 of her frens. she said one of the most funniest thing i've ever heard....."do u wan to join us? but my frens do not like guys around......". hmm...actually she is asking us to join or asking us to ciao? but i think the first one.......but ming tsong do not wan to and at the mean time, he was doing most of the talking n i kept looking at other things. then blah blah blah.......then lastly regina ask us wat we wan to do? then ming tsong said "we eat ourself lah", means do our own business or something like tat in cantonese. hehe......then, we went for a movie.......me and ming tsong minus regina and 2 of her frens.  then....as we were waiting for that movie to start, we went to pets wonderland. then at the 2nd level, i saw one gal, looking at me and 'cucuk' her other fren. then i know tat definitely not looking at me lah, so i tell ming tsong......"ming tsong, ur fren ar". then he said "where?" and i said "there!". then he said "woi, ur fren lah" and i said, "siao meh, i know my fren lah and where got this pretty one, if got oso i will recognize la". then..........tada.........there, in between, regina came out......haha. hmm...guess my eyes are getting worse......she smiled n we ciao, this time, really ciao.  it is strange how i could remember every single thing. i really hope i am not like this......as result, things i cherish, will always be a memories and not an everlasting things which i can get hold on. yeah, i do remember her fren too..........one is fair skinned and with brace (the steel thing ppl wear on their teeth, i think this is wat they called) and other one is dark skinned, tallest among them and very cool looking. and i still remember regina wore a black jeans......................hehe.........better if she didnt read this, else, she will kills me.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   is it a good thing to have a good memory? yeah and no...........katherine knew this long time ago and she is the only one who bother to know. she said it is a good thing and wish to be like me but to me, it is something like a curse. tat gal is the same as me, we remember things well as both of us are cancer, i really wish i was born 1 day earlier, then my star sign will be gemini. maybe it is not a good thing but at least it will be better than cancer. yeah, i believe in horoscope n i have stomach problems........gastric! i ate antasid since i was f4 (med for gastric) but i get lesser these days. from wat i knew, gastric can lead to stomach ulser then to stomach cancer. it is a curse? if it is, then i have suffered it for more than half of my life and i am getting weaker day by day. too many things happens in my life and i have seen so many things, death, sickness, separations and love.   i was so damn negative about myself but i tend to pretend to be damn positive to others. ppl think i am strong and cool but i am much weaker than anyone else. kuan yee, my only best fren, always asking wat i was thinking all the time, but i just smiled and said nothing but there is a lot of things. and as usual, i told to katherine but guess she forgot about it now. really wish to tell everyone about my feelings and problems but do they wan to listen? not all and even there is, they wont listen about if for a long time. yeah, i might look happy but...........i will never show my true feelings.......i think i got some traits of depressions.........now it is getting worse.................

      hmm.......sometimes when i think of her, i feel down but then seeing her name on some websites like friendster, make things worse. really hope tat i could really forget her.... but 4 yrs.....it is hard. sometimes wonder how she felt....but then i am sure she is much more happier. as from wat i heard, she is working in damansara, guess this is wat she wans. sometimes i feels like dying.....no need to think or have any problems but.....there is still a lot that i havent done yet. but one thing for sure i have already gradually forgetting her now. now i know how y ppl felt so bad when they broke up, although my case is different. when someone u love or care wants or have to leave u...........wish this never happens to me. really do..... maybe this is wat always happen to me, the one that i care or love will never stay forever.   yesterday the whole day i was thinking of finding wei hoong, and just now, i received his email to add him to friendster. sometimes it do happen, the one i was thinking at tat time, msged me, but for her......she will never do so anymore. it happens just 2 month and still it seems like a long time......and going back to old town and state, make things worse.........i accompany her to renew her ic, going to bank with her and accompany her to get the disposable contacts at state before she went to hk. i was really trying to stop her from going but i cant do anything cos i know after tat, she will be a changed person. and i was right..... does 4 yrs mean anything to her? am i stupid for doing so? i hope i knew the true answer but i will never knew............

      i got a big surprise today. i have posted a question at  urlLink expert exchange  and the reply i got from a guy called andreas shubert. i never tot i will get a detailed answers from a stranger, even my frens do not bother to answer me. from the information, i could see tat he is really good in these things, else, he wont answer me tat fast rite? really wish i knew this website long time ago.....btw, i got this site when i am doing my revision in the library but never bother to access it. hehe. guess i have to put him on my acknowledgement and reference for my report  i was suspecting something wront with my pc and i was right........there is a lot of virus, 47 of them and pc-cillin cant even detect one of them. luckily i watch techtv today n found a free antivirus program.....hehe. it is called  urlLink avg 6.0 .....DIE VIRUS DIE!!! buahahahahaha.........no wonder i cant access my tmnet acct, so many email sent out without my knowledge and etc. now everything is normal.....i guess except the diskette part. damn..........  how is regina? did i sound mad? maybe i did cos i havent met any of this problems before and is face it eventhough she is just 22, maybe she is much more mature than anyone i knew. but.....the problems is too much for her to bear it alone, wish i could help her but.........i cant. sometimes she take things as if it is her problems and responsibility but, she already did her best jus tat the result is not wat she expect. wish i could 'slap' her and wake her up.......JUS TAKE IT EASY!!! i do not know how stop her from taking more responsibilities and i hope she is reading this. God will not let down on people who have faith. u just need to wait for tat day to come. ur fate is in ur hand........n ur decision will decide how u are in the future......so u must make a good decision as it might affect ur whole life.....i have known her since....f5, she was carefree (maybe she is not, im not sure cos she only tell me her problems these few month) and now.......hmm.......she is still the regina i knew but...........more matured n thinking too much.......n i did pray for her.....hope she can solve her family problems and find a really good bf to take good care of her as she has been taking k of others for a very long time, guess it is her chance to be taken care of. okok, i'll stop, too much nonsense................. ;)

      yeah.....prepared and cooked the beef. hehe.....quite nice but the meat texture is not as good as wat i expected. maybe i should mince it by hand not machine.   my aunt came for awhile in the afternoon, father side, and told my mom tat my cousin sis likes australia and would like to permanently stay there. hmm.....still remembered how close we were when we were small and now, we barely see each other or talk at all. she was not attractive but now, she is getting taller and prettier. my first playmate is a gal, my first classmate is also a gal but still i cant get a gf? duh.........does this mean tat i will always have gals as a fren n nothing else? argh...........but nvm..........u get things when u least expected. hehe.........  argh.......should i use ms access or oracle? argh.........there is so many problems with access and my system is quite large and i am worried tat it will not support so many database. oracle has the 'industrial strength' but installations and requirements are too high for me. i need to test it at uni n i do not have the time. and somemore i do not know how to link my system to oracle.........HOW HOW?! and mr trevor expect a lot from our project. aii....uk ppl, uk requirements......this is ur degree project, show some degree quality!! duh.............and i find a good site to get informations from the net but it needs money!!! damn........  regina is mad at me...... not directly but indirectly!! i have already told her before tat i might not reply her mgs. maybe if i replied then i could help her with her prob. really wish i could help her but......... she think too much, jus let thing go and relax a bit. things do happened but she should not bear all of it and take it as her own responsibility. wish to tell her directly but......comm problem. maybe ppl in klang are jus too........sentimental? if kl ppl........ha......... don give a damn.........wat is in front of us is more important. the world will still spin n we have to move forward.......we cant stop it.........just let it go......like me....it is nice to think back but if it affect ones life, it will only be like cancer, eat up ur life until one day u die.......she is more luckier than me.......in some way..... jus tat she live her life by linking the past (the sad thing). Hope u will be happy, i am really sincere...........i really wish u could be happy always. any of her decisions, even if i do not agreed with her, i will still support her......i will scold lah but then wat can i do?! duh............................... happy always!! the world wont wait for u, u have to move on and do things u never did. hmm.........there are things i never did before, get drunk, a gf, buy a house, buy my own car, decorate my own house and garden, have my own kids.........haha..... there is so many things tat i never did......hmm...... i have wasted so much my time..............on......nvm. must get it asap!!!! :)   ps- i didnt mention any of her problem cos i have promised her.

      i'm tired........sleepy but still wan to online. mr trevor finally said something good about the reports but still i need to amend on the tor. argh....why is his requirements are totally different from others? others tor is short and mine is a very very long one. and still i am not so sure how to do it yet. but luckily he like my feasibility studies, risk analysis and benefit analysis. yeah............luckily.  kuan yee msg and ask me to yum cha, but i didnt turn on the hp, so have to make it to fri, hopefully. wan to tell him something about one of my classmates who looks like kit chan......hehe....pretty n s**y but i think unavailable. then joey msg at 12, yumcha also at kaki corner.........if earlier i will go but it is too late and i do not know how many ppl are there, esp the gals i do not know.  i have been bz these few days........assignments, project and exam is coming. regina msged me and i didnt even reply her at all. guess this is me, i told her before not to but still she never give up and the worse part is, i am negleting her. maybe it is because tat we can only be online frens and nothing else, as we're staying far apart and a bit of comm. problem. i will expect a lot from her and one day, she will be gone. i wish ppl tat i care or love will stay but it wont happen, so it is better if i do not have anyone to care of and love. maybe it is the best for me and everyone around me. i had too much experience in this and i do not like it and i do not wan it to happen to me ever again. i wish she could understand.....  suddenly feels like crying.........and at the same time, chatting with ginalynn make it worse. after celebrating yvonne's so many things to do but still i cant stop thinking. gina same like regina........is very supporting and she really did read the things i asked her to. ppl always said tat the westerns are not good but one how to see the whole picture. westerners are open minded and sometimes do things tat we cant accept here but they are sincere. the asians are the opposites and worse, we never knew who is 'wearing a mask'. sometimes i really wish i am in canada........nice, peaceful and most importantly there are many nice ppl around. i wish to meet ginalynn and hitomi...........2 of my frens in canada. ginalynn is supportive and patient and hitomi is supportive but bz and i seldom see her these days. if they were here, we will be best frens.......and as i said.......there are always something tat make it impossible to happen.   i really wish i could hold on to something tat i love but......as time goes by.....it gets far and far and in the end, i will never get hold on it. i really wish i could talk it out and in the mean time cry it out but..... i am the person who does not know how to express my feelings well. i am envy of others when they can talk and joke with their parents but my parents.......they never really talk to me before.

      yeah, finally watch super sapien aka hellboy.......not bad though, lots of 'serious jokes' though. but one thing i do not like is the ending. a good start but a very very bad ending. first, it tells the origin of hb, then the rest is history.......then.....actually, storyline is bad but the hb character is quite ok, so is abe sapien. should see his 'innocent joke'. haha......u know wat i mean. then after that movie, ming went to buy some pc games.......and we saw some 'adult games'. yvonne make a joke on ming and in the end.....we all tease her about it.....hehe..........  yesterday, something really shocked me, a girl from the internet asked me to be her bf!! argh......she add me to her list few weeks ago, somemore barely talk and now.....bf/gf? come on ler.....name oso dunno ler.....these world is getting stranger and stranger.....it was nice though but i was scarry cos i hate to disappoints gal and at tat time, i do not wan to have a gf which i do not have a feelings on. somemore i have never met her before.....i don wan to imagine her looks..............  hmm.......drove the whole day, then have dinner at a vegetarian rest., not bad but quite expensive.......as usual. been to places that 'we' have been before.......tears came out of a sudden maybe it is not easy to let things go that easily. i tot that going out will stop myself from thinking but it only make things worse. when u wish to be with that person for the rest of ur life and later something happened in between and u know that it will be impossible to get hold on to that person, it is tough to accept it.........  next week going out again!! yeah..........ming ask me to accompany him to sg buloh.....to met lai kuan and pooi man. but.......i don really know both of them and somemore, rarely talk with them, so reject. then next fri, might be going to sg long with ming, yvonne, mei and shirley aka alice. going to a pub for a drink......  and i got a good news.......my sis is getting married next year.....august. hehe.....finally...anyway, it is good for her though as she had a really caring bf.....i mean husband. he's a chef, and now working in dubai, arab. lots of experience and won lots of competitions. he make the best western cuisine but he is really bad in pastries and eastern cuisine though. is is very 'kiam siap' but he is willing to spent for my sis and although they have been together for....i think 6 yrs, they still looks like new couples. she had few bf before and her ex are all useless, either a big spender or just have looks but useless. her would-be husband is not tat good looking but he is caring, have a career (he can easily find any job at any hotel with his qualifications and exp), doesnt smoke or drink..........etc.        -  urlLink Chef Tang       -  urlLink Mr and Mrs Tang....hehe    it is easy to find someone we love but it is hard to find some good guy/girl. i heard so many things tat a guy said to the one they wan to court.......it sound so unrealistic and still the gals still believe it...duh. love is blind but.......sometimes we need to see things with our eye and at the same time with our heart.

      YEAH............i finally knew the reason y i cant put photos on my site.......hehe. solve the problem and put a link of oscar and a background music on this site. hehe. and also katherine photo too....hehe.......i think she will kills me if she knew about it. hehe.....but nvm.......she dunno about this blog.   i really wish to go to pwtc but......hmm.....i hate crowded places and most importantly, i do not like things which has link to pc cos it is not stable. like my md walkman, i bought the last of it's generations although the netmd was out cos..........every new hardware/software which is pc related, is not stable...lots of problem and luckily it doesnt give me a problem yet. hehe..........I NEVER BUY THINGS WHICH CAN BE PC PROGRAMMED........hehe  j is getting more and more annoying these days......argh.....i do not know why but.....she bothers me nearly everyday with her assignments and everything. argh..........  when clinton taught about the distributed system, none of us knew that it was quite related to the heart of the computer and we learn about supercomputer. i think we cant learn it from local lecturer.......from wat i knew is that supercomputer is just normal computers with normal microprocessor....just tat we need to group lots of processor and link them together so that they can process all the data at one go and the only thing that stops the supercomputer from growing is the network.......hehe.....we need network to send data ler. cray (it's a supercomputer) is 'round' shape because this will shortens the cables lor......hehe, cable short so data travels shorter, so processing speed increasses...okok, i;ll shut up............  finally get to taste the tom yam kfc.......not bad but.........hmm......they jus fried the chicken and then sprinkle some tom yam powder on it and.........tada...........u got tomyam KFC. tomolo is movie day...yeah......finally can go out, but only 3 of us........me, ming and yvonne, lai mei don wan........but nvm, save on petrol and toll..........and i think better treat her movie and food only lor....present....hehe..dunno ler  something happened today, oscar was mad at my mom.......y? she beat him cos he ran out and chase the cats......it was cute to see those cats ran for their life. she cane him and today, whole day he didnt follow my mom around..........does dog think like human? hehe.....tat is y i love him....he is special leh.......

      my junk mail is getting more day by day, maybe the microsoft is doing something about the spam. today, finished my assignments.......finally. yeah.........finish my assignment.....yeahhhhh.........still got project......damnnnnnn.  this saturday going for a movie......hellboy aka super sapien. hehe....then celebrate yvonne bday. i booked at 1:50 as requested by her but...who wants to watch movies at these time and somemore it is saturday? luckily talk talk talk and later change to 4:25, after tat dinner. should we get her the flower....nah.....hehe. really looking forward for this sat...hehe...didnt went out for a long time since......nvm. but the problem is finding a nice place to have dinner cos yvonne is a  vegetable  vegetarian. haha.....tot of going to svenson or some place nice but.......think have to let her and others to plan. but one thing for sure, NO FOODCOURT. yeah....never take a gal to a foodcourt esp a birthday gal, i mean lady. she is 6 yrs older than me but does not behave like one.....haha.   hmm....is it a good thing to be a vegetarian? nah.....imagine no more bbq, no more sirloin steak, no more bbq lamb, no more kfc, no more mcd........haha. they believe that eating meat is equal to killing but....what about plant? plant is a living thing too just that they do not have the priviledge to talk or maybe think but that does not mean that they cannot feel........i argued about it with yvonne till she was speechless, or maybe she does not wan to argue with me. hehe......and somemore she said that she was not suppose to eat eggs too. WAT?! i also argued with her but she do not wan to talk about it cos it involved s*x? urgh......from wat i know, the egg that we bought are......jus egg minus the 'tadpole'.....from wat i know, that the cock (the male chicken!) are separated from the female. so there is not chance that they can.......and somemore, like human they do produce egg just tat not in an 'egg' form and they produce it daily not 28 day.......i learn it from bio. conclusion, the chicken egg which we bought from the supermarket are not fertile, so it cannot be consider as a living thing. but i think fertile egg is much more exp than non-fertile one. ok....nonsense again.......medic!!!!!!!! I NEED SOME MED!!! :O

      time getting by fast everyday and still i am too lazy to do my things......haha....do not know why, sometimes thinking of sms, email or snail mail to my frens but.....in the end, i didnt do anything at all.   everyday, i read about the americans in iraq and the rice thing. does the sept 11 thing can be avoided? i dunno maybe it can. but one thing for sure, they are really good in lying. until now, no one knows who is telling the truth.   al-qaeda attack US and US attack iraq, what the hell are they doing? i mean, it's like there is someone bang u on the head from behind and u turn around, and u bang the first person u saw eventhough u know tat he might not be the one who bangs u. argh, i read it on the paper.......they have a meeting with the president, they link the attack the the al-qaeda but the president kept talking about the iraq and find some excuse to attack them.   from wat i know, he is worse in 'calculations'. one should see his blunder when he was debating with al gore. how can they choose someone like him.........a genius minus the rationality. duh.......     ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~      I am George W.

      very farn!! rushing a project and an assignment when i am not in the mood of doing anything......argh...damn. damn dmu and damn ftms.........damn. back to the happy part.....my dog.....he is the weirdest dog i have ever see, he loves chocolate, tapioca, and fruits. he looks like a shih tzu but does not behave like one although there is some traits lah. he is now behind me.....really wish he will live as long as i do but....who knows....although he's a dog but i have never treat him as one. sometimes it's hurt when i beat him bcos he bites ppl but......have to cos he's too cute and everyone cuddles him like a doll and this is wat he hates most. yeah....he is very choosy in his food........if he does not eat the things we gave him, it means the food is not nice at all....seriously. i think after i move out, i will get her a........wife....have many kids so tat his kids can accompany me n my kids till the end............OSCAR FOREVER..... :)  argh........i wan to tell a story......but.......hope u all will really read it.....it's a really nice one....trust me...   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~   once, there were a couple, the bf (O), is poor but he cares and loves his gf so much tat he is willing to sacrifice everything for her but the opposite for the gf (Y). they seems like a normal couple but the gf, were not happy bcos he could not buy her anything bcos he cant afford it compare to her frens bf, who are willing to spend a lot on them.  one day, they went out shopping and  Y  saw a ring, a diamond ring,  O  knew that she really loves to have it and her birthday was near but he cant afford it and  Y  knew tat he cant afford it. so they went away.....and on her birthday,  O  bought her a ring but it was wrapped with alluminium foil. yeah...she knew it was a ring but she knew tat it is a cheap one so she never opens the present tat  O  gave.       as time pass by, there is one guy, a rich one are trying to court  Y , she was happy as that guy gave a lot of expensive gift to her. and one day,  Y  suggested to  O  that it is the end of their relationship, so they broke up.  O  was very sad............ :,(  years has passed by,  Y  got married to tat rich guy. she has everything tat money can buy but she still, she felt tat there is still something missing in her life....... her husband have many business to look after and he was too busy for her. and one day, her husbands' business failed........losses everything and went bankrup and he left her.  one day, as  Y  was going out to buy something, she was greeted by someone......someone that she never saw for a very long time,  O  .  O  has changed and he invite her back to his house and she agreed.  ......arriving at the doorsteps of his house, a girl opens the door, it was  O  wife and she was pregnant. both of them is a loving husband and wife as what  Y  sees. then, something caught  Y  attention.........her ring, it was wrapped with alluminium foil, like the one she gets on his birthday and she ask her about it.  O  wife laughed and take the ring out and unwrap it, it was a very beautiful diamond ring. "isnt tat silly for him to do tat?" said his wife, then  Y  said "no, it is romantic".........his wife laughed "yeah, he is silly sometimes but it is really romantic". then  O  cuts in........he hug his wife and laugh about it.  Y  finally knew that the thing tat she's missing of in her life is ................ LOVE .  she went back home, and then she find back the give that present tat  O  gave to her on her birthday. she never opens it until now, she opens it..........it was a ring tat  O  has work so hard to buy it.......the beautiful diamond ring that she always wanted..........she cried and regret about it..........   THE END...........    Love can make you happy although often times it hurts.But love is only special if you give it to which it's worth.  Bottomline : If you found someone who truly appreciates you, he/she deserves more of your love.   Two tear drops were floating down the river. One teardrop said to the other, "I'm the teardrop of a girl who loved a man and lost him. Who are you?"... "I'm the teardrop of the man who regret letting a girl go..."  Bottomline : Nobody will sympathise a person who constantly let chances passes by without making any efforts to salvage. We normally don't realise how important our loved and closed ones are until they left us, we'll start reminiscences which results misery.     ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~   ps- it may not be the best essay or story tat u have ever heard of but.....it is a really nice one if u truly understands it............hey, i still got few story to tell....................haha........wait ya....

      still stuck in the report.....maybe i have stop doing the report for a long time, so no mood to do it already. wish to have someone in the family who knew about these kind of thing. but trevor demand was different from other supervisor. i do not know who is doing the right thing but hopefully trevor knows wat he is doing.  the things i found yesterday for my comparison report is all.......useless, i wan to find the advantages of vb but in the end, i found more on its disadvantages. argh......  went to kajang for the satay......it was not really tat nice but then it is better compared to the other satay. but the worst part is that they are not a honest...aii...wat to do, malays.....we ordered 60 and later when we ciao, we count (based on how much we eat lah) then we found out tat they charge us for 60 while we only have 48, tat is too much. and there is 2 site, one is next to the stadium and other is opposite. but the one which is next to the stadium, is the one who had the most customer (they had a branch at the opposite of the stadium). the one opposite the stadium is a foodcourt, there is at least 3 satay stall and the 'blue' one is the popular, while the rest, struggling to survive (one stall had no customer at all and the other one had around 10). so..........next time, don go to the hj. sam....i forgot the name.....if wan to order, don order so many at one time and count first.....!!   chat with regina just now......we are getting less topic to talk about. i do not know why but i dunno how to talk anymore.......malu liao? hmm.....no kwar, i am not facing her....ai......and yvonne is getting sarcastic to me. i do not know why but something strange.......she said my description at friendster counds 'desperate'! now i have to change back........ y lah? so sarcastic.........gals..duh

      today is her birthday, i sms and wish her although she never did so 2 days ago. i am stupid, still care for someone who does not care about me at all. every yr, i wish to celeb her bday but every yr, she wish to avoid me on my bday. i knew she do not want to celeb with me, tats y i always find someone to celeb her bday without her knowing. i really wish that she knew how much i did for her but i never told her. sometimes i do not know if the things i did and everything i did for her is.......stupid. i do not know, i wish someone could read this and gave me some answers...........i really do. guess tat i have to face the reality, no one wants to be with some poor ppl. it hurts....... but wat hurts most is when the one u care most says tat u are nothing to them. hope she is fine now........maybe after all these yrs, after yrs of trying to hold on to her, it is fate for us tat we will never be together.... guess that there will never be 2 crabs(cancer) in one frenship or more than that. from now on, i think i will never ever try to hold on to something which i do not have confidence in.......even frenship...... i am just a 'port' to them and they are the 'ships'......come and go.         urlLink Happy Birthday Irene       i tot that i could do the module selections for today but my login are having problems, but luckily i did solve it for the whole day and then around 6 something, helped yvonne with the codings, she wasted her time doing the interface and i laughed at her. and as usual, either scold me or hit me......but this time, she is getting more and more daring this time. hmm........we are close but then the limit is only frens, best fren or bro and sis.

      i still cant do the delete and update part of the application. how can i delete it? if not, i have only 3 weeks to go before handing in the project together with the reports. i am really stressed already, somemore, there is no one available to help me. wish to have some frens with it background and vb too.............. and most importantly they are willing to help me.....aii.........  &nbsp;  watched a documentary just now....about a plane malfunction and the door jus opened and the passengers thrown out. then one of the victim mom, saw his son in grey coat standing there...in her dream and when she woke up, she knew something happened to her son. it was....sad to see that their only son died. i kept thinking, what will happen to me&nbsp;in 10, 20, 30 or 40 yrs time? will i still be around? what happened if my parents were not around? sometimes i really wish i could 'go' first but it is too selfish, what will&nbsp;happen to my parents? this is y i really wish i could tell them how important they are to me. it is always hard to tell someone we really care that we do care. will i ever see 'her' again? really wish she could understand how important she is to me but the........ she will never do. 4 yrs........'taking things up is easy, letting it go is hard', it is already more than 5 month, still it is so hard to let go............... &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      i felt really really moody today. i dreamt of her yesterday night..........i think it was in a shopping mall, where i was with yu jing and her fren. then suddenly out of nowhere, she came in and put a note on the board (yeah, it was strange to have a board in a shopping mall). she didnt saw me, i really wish she could see me but she never noticed me at all. then she went out............then i went out&nbsp;hoping to see her&nbsp;again but i cant..........then i woke up. yeah........ i woke up only&nbsp;if the dreams were scarry and sad. guess this time is on the sad part. i do not know why i still dream of her.........maybe because of 'maggi mee', everytime i saw her, i don feel excited unlike other guys...........i felt sad when i see her, reminds me of 'her', both are thin and stayed in the same area too but then, 'maggi mee' is much more attractive than her. sometimes i really wish tat i could be frens with 'maggi mee' like all the ppl in the class but then, i don feel like making frens with her.......not because of her problem, it is mine. tat is y, we never really talked before. she got so many things tat reminds me of her.......... sometimes really wish i could tell someone how important they are to me but i will never have the courage to do so and in the end..............i will never had the chance. i really hope tat one day, i will find someone i really really love........ and have a good ending. but then, what i knew is, i will never love someone like how i love her again...........for now.  &nbsp; i have done 99% of my client side application, now only left the management side. hope to finish it by this week.........hopefully then i will do the reports and c&amp;e assignment. if everything is done, then i will worried about my exams and then..............results and then my degree grades and finally my work. hope to get a good degree and a good job..................hope........ &nbsp; &nbsp;

      dissappointed.........as humans are getting more and more civillized or opposite, things tend to change.  cases of murder, suicide and etc is getting worse day by day, yeah, the cost of development by sacrificing the ethical and moral values of human. i read a lot of ethical journals these days and some of it are really interesting than the story books, tells us more about 'us' in terms of behaviour and our attitude. it is sad that to satisfy our needs or......etc, we tend to sacrifice others...........is this worth it?  few days ago, a couple was killed, slit their throat and stab on the stomach and then was thrown into a lake, why? because they were at the wrong place and at the wrong time. just because of some cash and handphones, they end up like this, which they should not. they are less than 2o yrs old, and they do not deserve this. the robbers? indians or malay, i do not know but i wish that one day, they will get wat they did......... how do they feel when they put a knife into someones neck or stomach? is money really that important that the life of a human being can be sacrificed? i do not know............. does all this worth it?  and today, a dad killed their own child before hanging himself, why? because he is going to separate with his wife and as his wife earns more than him, chances of getting the right to take k of the children is very slim. the father and his 3 children are very upset about this as their family is going to break up. in the end, on his daughter birthday 3rd aug (celeb early), the father brought all his children to celebrate and then, he strangled all of them before hanging himself.  3 of his children are really good looking and pretty, should they deserve this? NO! they deserve a better one.........when i read the  urlLink Star  today, i felt really sad, not because of wat the dad did and wat happened to the family but because of the kids. the parents had the problems and now the innocent kids are the victim.  Hope that they will rest in peace........................................  bloody 24hrs........headlines for The Malay Mail................................. is there hope in humanity? i do not know...............................     Tribute for all the previous lives that have been taken away
