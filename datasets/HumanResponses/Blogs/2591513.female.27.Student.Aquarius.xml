      I actually don't know where to begin.  I don't know whether to start in tears...or to be happy that I am still here...I don't know.  Well my birthday is in a few days and I can't bring myself to be excited.  I think maybe because I am having a very hard time affording school and I am torn between staying in school or probably taking the semester off...but I can't do that, we are so depending on this financial aid...that mind you isn't that great...thanks to all those bastards that cheat the frickin' system and take all the frickin' money for students like me, who can't afford to go to college because we have KIDS!  UGH  Do NOT get me started on all of that.  I am so tired of all that BS.  That is what it is.  Money should be given to does who deserve it and will use the money towards funding their education...not for gambling...buying frivolous things...let me tell ya...  Anyway, life is okay...well that is about it...

      Okay, so I showered late and cannot go back to sleep.  I am tired though.  The puppy was crying.  Ed had to put him to sleep and then put him on his bed and then silently go upstairs.  We had to trap him in the kitchen because he is scared of the laundry room...mom put him in there while the dryer was running.  I would be scared too.  Ed spent the evening chasing him around to use the potty on his training sheet.  LOL  Yeah that was fun.  A couple of accidents,  but in the end, he did use it on the sheet.  Now how we are going to keep that up with Ed gone...that will be interesting.  I have had a lot on my mind.  A lot of things I talk about here.  A lot of things I don't.  The things I don't talk about are the things I can't deal with right now.  So I shove it behind.  The bad thing is it builds up.  My birthday is in less than 2 weeks.  Wow, already?  Where did the time go?  Too bad you can ask people to pay your bills...haha...that would be a GREAT GIFT....just kidding...well maybe not...haha  I feel like I am always trying to catch up to something I cannot catch up to.  I don't know.  i can't really explain it...oh to be in my mind, huh?

      We have a new family member...STITCH...he is so so cute, ask Leila...but according to Mica, he will turn ugly when he gets big.  We got him at a pound like 40 minutes away...he is an energetic puppy (A Black Lab mix).  He is too cute and sure does live up to his name Stitch.  Bailey had the honor of naming him.  We wanted him to hook up with Kawaii (not really like that, that would be a funny looking dog...haha) but anyway, it won't happen because Kawaii is a Gay.  I told Jess that it was okay because Stitch will probably be a gay too.  haha  i am saddened by a chain of events involving my immediate family and not so immediate family.  So much miscommunication and carrying grudges makes family unity so difficult.  There are somethings I have to change, like my attitude towards someone (you all know who I am talking about...and no she isn't related to me...thank goodness)...but that is hard when they don't make an effort to be nice.  You know?  Anyway...it will all happen when she grows up and starts showing some respect.  Well the other problem, I won't get into...but know this...money can only take you so far...once money takes you away from your family, it has taken you in the wrong direction.  I will NEVER let money become an issue in my family...not to this extent...and I will NEVER do business with family.  Too many unpredictable things can go wrong and too much to risk....  I hope you all (umm...that would be Leila and Mica...haha) have a good weekend.  I have a butt ton of homework to do.

      I haven't posted too much because I was starting to get sick and feeling the onset of depression.  Thank goodness I still have my sister to use as a sounding board.  My life in these past few weeks of 2004 has been filled with loss.  I hope to start off hte next month on better footing.  But the good thing about experiencing all this loss is that I have come to so very interesting revelations and insight.  Thank goodness.

      No dog, the lady never called...oh well...that just means to look for one closer to home and that isn't such a bad thing.  I am a little peeved at people and their priorities...but that is just me.  I am not even going to go into it.  It is life and I am trying not to harbor any ill feelings to anyone...workd for most the time, not to one person in particular, but those of you who read this know my beef with that someone...haha.  And NO that someone is not related to me.  So anyway, today everyone is feeling sick, bad timing with school just starting and all.  I don't want to have to do this semester begging my professors not to drop me.  Although I have already.  I miss my first day of class because my uncle's mother passed away.  I don't want to miss her funeral.  My uncle Mike is a great man and I would like to be there for him and his family.  It is sad.  I know he must be having a hard time.  Lately I have been full of sadness for my husband's friend's passing.  After hearing how he took his life I am brought back to my past and remembering feeling like there was no other alternative but to take your life.  Of course back then it was young adolescent stupidity...but that feeling was so real.  So thinking about how rock bottom he must have felt.  It makes me sad.  I also think heavily about the daughter who will grow up wondering why her father is gone in such a tragic way.  I can't begin to imagine how to help a child go through something as traumatic as that.

      So I changed my blog only because I thought this one to be more fitting.  I would love to be that girl in the picture...  Anyways, we are trying to adopt a black lab.  I feel the dog would be very therapeutic to this family.  I think Kawaii rubbed off on us.  LOL

      So I decided to change things because I was bored and could not sleep.  My thoughts are with our finances, like how are we going to afford college and books and stuff like that.  I am not going to stress about it anymore because I promised myself not to sweat the small stuff.  I just have to worry about getting the good grades so I can get the scholarships and then money for college won't be an issue right?  haha  So that is what the plan is anyway.  Bailey and Ed are pooped.  Bailey had the jogathon and Ed had Basketball tryouts.  I thought it was funny...They are both knocked out...Of course Ed has some liquor in his system, but it is the weekend right?  So they keep reminding me.  I feel bad, Emily is sick and I can't do anything for her because she only wants to go to my mom.

      So my son just cost me $84...but it is a good $84.  I am so proud of him, he did 14 laps for his jog-a-thon.  That is AMAZING with his heart condition and he really put his all in it, so that is what counts.  I am so very proud of that little man.  He is growing so fast.  I don't know where the time goes...even though he makes me so angry when he is in the mood to whine and cry.  I love that boy beyond anything I can ever imagine and I can't imagine my life without him.  When I am feeling down and like I want the world to pity me, I remember that he has been through so much in his young life but keeps going on and amazing every person he touches in his life...and he has two great cooky little sisters too.  I LOVE my kids and with them I am nothing.  They have taught me the important things in life and showed me what it means to love and be loved.

      So I have been contemplating not going to school this semester and just working.  The money situation in the house sucks.  I had BIG plans for my birthday, only because I wanted to get away, but I don't think that is going to happen.  Oh well.  I guess there are more important things to life, right?  Well, I have been depressed the past couple of days, hence the short blogs.  I guess you can say everything was setting in.  The loss of the baby, the physical and emotional hardness of it.  Then Ed finds out a military buddy, someone he admired killed himself.  I cannot judge him because of his previous actions that put him in jail because we don't know what private hell he was in.  I cannot imagine the experience of war, what was seen, what was heard and how it can alter a person's mind.  The man I did know loved his career and his family more than most men I know.  So it is hard to swallow that he would give them up without a fight.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife and beautiful daughter.  I also pray that his sould will rest in peace.  Then we also hear that my Uncle Mike's mother passed away.  All these deaths...just doens't seem right to be happening so early in the year.  What a sad way to start the year.  I think with the bleeding slowing down, my body is starting to adjust.  Thank goodness.  Well I hope you are all enjoying your day...the 3 of you who read this...haha

      The most physically and emotinally draining day of my life.  I think after going through a lot of things...this tops as the worst.  So I finally "pass the tissue."  It had to be the worst feeling because it was the closure of the pregnancy....the finale.  They gave me this medicine that induced me and so I have been so tired and moody.  I can't even explain my feeling...like I want to cry and to mourn, but it feels like it isn't right...but the fetus, embryo, whatever the medical terminology is for it was my child....regardless of how developed he or she may have been.  That is something I cannot deny.  Anyway, I am tired and exhausted and just want to rest.  The painkillers are great, but have taken their toll on me.

      So tomorrow I go in for my appointment.  I hate physical exams...the female type...I have had about 5 since the year started.  I just want to be well before school starts...no more of this crampy yucky stuff....I want to be able to go to the gym and be a healthier me.  I liked that last year I worked out religiously...I want to do that again.  I have to go to bed.  I am TIRED and well lightheaded...

      Letting go...I think the hardest thing to do...but sometimes letting go is the only way to see if the relationship really meant anything.  Ah life....thank goodness the marriage isn't going bad, huh?  (*knocking on wood*  don't want to jinx myself...) Ed and I are doing great...pending any further deployment...he seems to get into these gray area situations...and I love him to death and know that they are never intentionally mean or done to hurt me...  Anyway, I have BIG TIME money woes and it is starting to dampen my year...Pray that we get out of this frickin' money hole we are sinking in...  On the UP side...Emily is 11 months old today...and we are getting ready to prepare her first birthday and her Christening the following month...busy busy busy....she started to walk on the 7th, by the way...yeah my babies are growing...

      Annoyed...too much stuff changing...and I don't know if I want to embrace it or be mad.  I can't go into detail because well, it is rather long and something I would want to relive anyway.  I used to think change was good...and these days, it seems to be sad for me.  Maybe it is the fact that I hold on to my past and keep it close.  I guess it isn't always practical when you get older.  You know what I think is the the saddest phrase, "Growing apart."  I know it is something that happens a lot to many people.  I guess when it happens to you, you just aren't ready for it...especially when growing apart means letting go of a relationship.  NO I am not talking about Ed.  I don't think I would ever let things go that far...but it is with an old friend.  I understand, but also am still deeply saddened, besides no matter how much you may love and hate a person, it isn't easy admitting that the friendship only has a past and no present, and more than likely no immediate future...but that's life right?  Friends come and go?  But if they aren't just friends?  What if they were people you considered family?  Does that change the rules of growing apart?  It is funny as I say this, I am finding roads back to my friends from elementary school.  It is so nice to be able to chat with them.  I think when everything is well with me, I will set up a date to get together with them and see them.  I think it would be cool.  Although I am sure all of us have changed in so many ways.  My birthday plans may be put on hold only because there isn't a lot of money right now...unless I work with the cleaning people I know.  I just hate working with their chemicals and sticky stuff...and they give us the nastiest places sometimes...but I guess if I want to go out for my birthday right?  Also, Ed and I will celebrate nice years of being together...oh damn, has it been nine years already?  haha  Time flies when you are in love...and yes after 9 years I am STILL very much in love with Ed.  No matter how crazy he drives me.  So that is it...I would vent about my sister not wanting to hang out with me on my birthday, but what's new?  Nothing I guess.  Accept the things I cannot change...I need to learn that...Obviously a lesson I need to accept for this year...as I am now learning.

      I was reading the daily calendar thing my sister got me for Christmas and the quote for the 7th hit home..."Let the little things go." and then it goes on to say, "How much time we spend--and waste--in hassling over the little things in life.  The person who cut us off on the freeway; forgetting to make a phone call; someone not following through on a promise; the house not being just right...When we hold on, we are the ones who suffer.  Little things are little things, and we can fit almost everything into that category. Move on."  Talk about hitting home.  It is exactly what I told myself I would try and do....not sweat the small stuff and always look at the big picture...afterall, isn't that the part that matters?

      Well I stayed home today because I wasn't feeling well, so Ed had to take Bailey to school.  I have been cramping a lot lately and so I haven't been in a very good mood.  I am however planning on going to Universal for my birthday...I know it is a few weeks away, but it should be fun.  I need to get away.  I need the time to just go away.  I look around the house and am sometimes saddened.  We kept the crib up in preparation for the new baby, but since there will be no baby, we have to take it down...but I know one day that crib will be up again and we will be overjoyed...not worried the next time aorund.  So while I am having a cramp free moment, I thought I would go online and just type in my random thoughts...Leila is going to Disneyland...we won't be going anytime soon...maybe sometime around taxes when we get some money...hmmm....that would be nice.  Well I think that is it...on to more birthday planning.

      Well let's see.  I find myself seeing things in a whole and different light.  I feel bad that it has taken me this long to get here...but I guess that is what growing is all about...it happens at the right time and when you least expect it.  all my life I always thought I had to be a certain way and never let myself enjoy the things I wanted to enjoy and I was so wrong about all that.  I am enjoying the life I have and not thinking about whether I am entitled to the happiness.  I also started off this year with settling past differences with people.  I figured that I need to live a life with no regrets or ill feelings because life is too short to live with all that bad stuff.  Why carry ill feelings towards another person?  What does it enable you to do?  NOTHING  So I made my ammends with those I had problems with.  It is funny because the person I first did that with was a few years back.  I had HUGE beef with JoAnn...I mean, HUGE.  But then I grew up and apologized for my stupidity through the whole ordeal and got to know her.  When I finally got to know her, I admired her and actually found a friendship I could trust and actually enjoyed.  In fact I have shared with her a lot of the things that have happened in my life the past couple of years...and all that stupid stuff from the past seems more ridiculous with each passing day.  I wonder why high school stupidity can make things seem so big, when they aren't.  I am so sorry for the dumb things I did in high school, but am glad that after all that is said and done, I have made, what I think, will be a life long friend in JoAnn.  Reflecting on high school, I think about my two closest friends...the ones who know my innder demons and still love me...well I hope they do...Keiko and Tim...next to Ed, there are no other that know me better or longer.  I miss them, but life has gotten so busy for everyone involved...I hope we get back to being best friends and having good times together...I miss that....plus I want to meet the new loves in their lives...one day at a time, right?  I think I took them for granted...for that I am sorry.  Then there are the wonderful friends of my youth, who I long to see.  One of my best friends growing up, Toni, has been in touch with me a lot lately.  I LOVE IT.  It is so nice to communicate with people you grew up with.  It reminds you of the innocence you once had.  I would love to meet up with them and see what they all are up to.  I miss them.  It would be nice to reconnect.  Lastly I am realizing that in the end, no matter how many friends you have, family will always be first...of course most my friends I consider family...but I am realizing just how great blood really is.  The family bond can never be replaced, nor should it ever.  So these days I have been thinking of reconnecting with my past and moving onto a brighter future with more optimism...I also am truly driven to finish school and be a teacher.  I finally believe in myself enough to do it and not just talk about it.  I am also thinking of writing a book...or children's books.  I am just gearing myself to get organized first.  So that is the enlightenment I have come to.  Did I bore you guys to sleep yet?

      Well I went to the hospital today to confirm whether or not I had miscarried, and just like I had thought...I did.  They gave me the choice to have a dnc, or naturally and I thought I would try naturally.  I am still sore and overwhelmed, but I think I am coping with it okay.  I t hink having three other children in my life takes the edge off.  I think a little part of Ed and I wanted to believe that the baby was still there, just hiding...but with my hormone levels going down, it wasn't at all possible that the baby was still living.  Well it is late and I am tired and mentally drained.

      Well I think I am better now, realizing that my goals are clearer to me and my motivation greater to finish college and get on with life.  I don't know for sure if we will have another one, I will not say we won't for sure and I won't say we will for sure.  It all depends on what God has planned for the two of us.  I am just glad and blessed to have the family and friends that I have.  Especially the ones who have come to me with support with this episode of my life.  Maybe a bit more dramatic than I wanted to be, but I blame it on the fact that the pregnancy hormones are still raging through my body and taking me on an emotional rollercoaster.  I have learned that there is only one way to look at life and that is optimistically no matter how bad the situation may seem to be.  Thank you to all who read this blabbering and for those of you who have helped me through this situation.

      Well, it looks as though Ed and I have lost the baby.  I am saddened of course.  I know that I wasn't mentally prepared to be a mommy of four, but if you know me, you know how much I value each of my children's life...so this was a bit hard for me to take.  I have always believed that a life starts at conception, so the moment I found out I was pregnant was the moment I started to love my child.  The baby wasn't really developed, somewhere in December the baby stopped growing.  I know that it is for the best, it probably had some health problems, or what I hear, not meant to be...but that lost child is still loved dearly by me.  Maybe I am a little too emotionally tied to this baby, maybe that has been the reason why today I have felt so BLAH.  I go back to the hospital on Tuesday.  After the long time in the ER last night, I am not looking forward to being there again.  All things happen for a reason, I am a firm believer in that.  Someday, when we are ready and able to, Ed and I will complete our family by having another child...MAYBE...and when and if that happens, I know we will be better prepared financially, emotionally, mentally and for me anyway, physically...24hour here we come.  I have about 80 pounds I need to shed, how else should you spend the New Year, right?

      I was in the shower then I thought, I didn't even mention how my holidays went.  actually to be completely honest with you, they came and went.  Maybe it is the daddy's girl in me, but since my dad has missed so many holidays, they just don't seem the same anymore.  Although I tried to make it special for the kids.  I love watching their faces light up when they open their gifts.  I unfortunately was let go from my part time job at the Children's Place, the people there were awesome and I LOVED the customers too.  It was a pretty decent job, considering.  I miss it, oddly enough.  I guess things happen for a reason, who knows, maybe something will open up with them again.  Never believe a door is shut...life can surprise you like that.  Ah..and school...I only took 9 units.  I wanted to take it easy, we had that Make-A-Wish trip for Bailey.  So I knew I would miss a lot fo school...then there were the fires and the week the kids ALL got sick.  So i pretty much BEGGED my teachers not to drop me.  Thank goodness they didn't.  I got a B in my math (6 units) and an A in my English.  I LOVE ENGLISH!  I don't know why.  I do know that I want to teach English at the high school level, or teach at a Catholic school...the 8th grade, I am thinking.  I want to teach children that age to believe in their talents and somehow teach them how to love reading and writing as much as I do.  Writing is my passion...well after my Ed of course.  So only a few of you know this site...I figured it would be easier than having to mass e-mail or attempt to catch up with my e-mail.  I wanted you all to know what was going on with me...I am still the same insane person I have always been, maybe a little more with each child I bring into this world.  =P

      Okay so I just realized it is the 2nd, which means that my birthday and my baby Emmy's birthday is coming soon.  My birthday isn't of much significance...lol  I am turning way too old.  But a few days after that my best friend, Heidi, from NJ is coming to town.  This is a HUGE deal for me because...Well...I don't have too many friends...So when one of them actually come out here, it is a HUGE deal for me.  Plus she is bringing her family and I miss her little girls...I actually get to meet one of them for the first time.  Then not too long after they leave, my little Emmy turns one.  I can't believe she is going to be one.  I had her without Ed because he was out in Kuwait at the time.  That had to be the hardest labor...Mostly because he is my rock and when he wasn't there it was hard...I was scared and I think my fear overwhelmed me.  I love my family to death, but their reaction to being in the delivery room for the first time ( I didn't have them in there the other two times because I wasn't too comfortable with it yet.) well let's just say, it was funny after hindsight.  haha  So yeah my baby is turning one.  Time goes by so fast.  I have to plan her first birthday party, which unfortunately will fall on Valentine's day.  I may go with Sunday, so that more people are able to make it.  Also so I am able to do something with Ed.  We don't get to go out much, mostly lack of funds but sometimes just the lack of energy in me to go out.  So that might be nice.  As for the pregnancy, still spotting.  I am spotting more this time around than my first three pregnancy.  So I am a little terrified...Okay maybe a lot.  I am a worry wart, as many of you already know.  My first appointment with a real doctor is going to be on the 14th...So we will see...I will be able to give you a due date then.  Well I did my one good deed for the year.  I figure I should start the New Year right yesterday and I lent my sister some money to take her new girl out.  I know how special she wanted to make it for her, so I thought I would help her out.  I love my sisters and they love me.  I know this.  Sometimes we get into the most ridiculous fights, but in the end we are still there.  So I hope she has a lot of fun and that her Frisco trip is as romantic as she envisioned.    Okay, so I had a lot to just jot down...I hope to be a future writer, so I guess this really just helps me get things out.

      Wow, 2004 already?  Where the heck did the time go?  So my sister sends me the link, or types in the link to her blog site.  I have frequented a few people's blog and always considered doing one, but never got around to it.  So I am very NEW to all this.  I mostly started this as a sounding board for all my ups and downs...Mostly because I have been going through crazy mood swings thanks to my wonderful pregnancy.  Don't get me wrong, I am HAPPY about being pregnant, but when it is your fourth child and you were on b/c...Well let's just say it caught me off guard.  I am crazy about my kids, but they drive me crazy as well.  Plus I am struggling to finish college (I have 2 more years left...Give or take).  I am nearing a birthday and let's just say that I wanted to be done with college a long time ago...But on that same note, I don't regret the choices I made.  It brought me to a very loving husband, Ed, and three beautiful children, Bailey, Nalani and Emily.  So anyway, here I am, no due date as of yet...All day I have had cramps and a little bit of spotting.  Everyone says it is normal and that if anything happens...It happens.  Although I am ill prepared for this child, I don't want to lose it either.  One of those things I guess.  So needless to say I am EXTREMELY moody and my poor husband is getting the grunt of it.  I love him for his patience...I hope he survives this pregnancy...  So that's it for a first entry...Boring, I know...But what can I say?

      I have been out of the loop...maybe trying to figure out life, maybe contemplating the tests that I am being brought to.  I don't know.  I am however looking forward to planning my daughter's chirstening, which sadly took the back burner to the drama in our lives.  So anyway, just letting you all know I am still here, just contemplating life...I will be back on here to write what I have come to the conclusion about it.

      I am so sick....lol  THANKS ED.  Although I have been reassured my cough is not contagious....thanks, I just sound like I am about to spread germs for a living.  Another good friend contacted me the other day.  It was so nice to hear from her.  I don't talk to old friends too often, I am pretty busy trying to make sense of my life.  i should though.  I might not be so insane.  Who knows.  Anyway...I hope you are all having a great weekend. I am actually trying to finish homework so I am not cramming tomorrow night.  I hate cramming.

      My very dear friend Heidi reminded me of what is good about my life...I have good family (immediate anyway...my cousins for the most part tend to be...well better omitted..) and that I do have some very good friends out there.  She e-mailed me and reminded me that she was there, although thousands of miles away, still there.  How did I get so lucky?  Hell she even flew out to see us...I still can't believe how generous she is with her time and her love.  THANK YOU HEIDI!  Thank you for reminding me that there are people out there who know the true value of relationships...whether they be family or friends...I LOVE YA and MISS YOU TONS...more so now.

      I feel so bad...I can't help my sister out, I can't help my mom out...hell I can't even help myself out....please pray that I get thsi job...there is a lot riding on it.  UGH  I am still heated about my cousin...what should I do?  I tried numerous times to talk to him, but he ignores my calls.  Talk about immature...and this fool is nearing his 40's.  You would think that having 4 kids, he would be a little more mature.

      MAD!!!!  That is what I am feeling.  How do you get a refund and end up paying everyone and their momma...literally?  I am not big on money.  In fact I do my best to help everyone, now I am afraid that from helping people I have dug myself in a hole I cannot get out of.  I have been so depressed lately.  UGH  I hate money.  Anyway, I applied for a job at the base...hopefully Ed remembers to turn it in.  He is so moody lately.  Gosh, you think women PMS, try the male version...I guarantee it is that much worst.  Leila is in a predicament, but I think the route she is going will be the best for her.  Unless you are someone else, you can't rely on the parents.  Just isn't wise...as I am learning.  I am so annoyed, in a way bad mood.  Like I said, the money situation is horrible...and according to my mom, it is about to get worst.  Shoot me already. I am so serious.  I don't think I have felt this bad in a very long time.  It isn't mom's fault.  DAMN MY COUSIN!  I am usually a nice person...but FRICKIN' A...He screwed us BIG TIME.  SOB  Karma, that's all I gotta say on that...Karma's a BITCH.    Okay, so evidently I am in a VERY foul mood.  Sorry.

      Wow, long time no post...for those of you who know my latest drama, you know why I haven't been on here.  I don't want to go into detail because the whole thought of it depresses me to no end.  So I am going to try and get out of this blue stage and get on with life.  Live and learn.  Emmy's one.  She didn't get the birthday she deserved, but we are taking her to Disneyland this weekend in hopes to erase from all our minds the misfortune we encountered last week.    I will have to keep it there for now...I have a paper and two mid-terms tomorrow...wish me luck.

      Okay, so my birthday came and went, unfortunately so did the wonderful visit from one of my best friends, Heidi and family of course.  To say that their visit was nice would be a severe understatement.  It was so nice to see them and yes, we feel the gap again...lol    I think it is kind of funny because I think our daughters hit it off just as well as we did...and on a first meeting...must get it from us, huh?  Banani and Sidey (as they call each other) as best cousins...lol since according to the both of them that is what they strictly are...not friends...just cousins.  Even Bailey got really sad with the departure of Uncle Ian.   Why can't Auntie Heidi live in Chula Vista?    GOOD QUESTION!   Actually I understand completely why it is better for ehr and her fmaily to stay there.  They are much better off there financially, but it isn't going to stop her family out here from begging them to move here every chance they get...Heidi, if you are reading this...Just know you guys are loved and that is the only reason why we nag you guys to move back...it isn't because we don't have your best interest in  heart.  So spending time with them was amazing, I hope they enjoyed the time we spent together.  So anyway, that is as much as I have to talk about.  Oh Emily Love will be 1 year old on THursday.  OMG!  Where did the time go?  Her first birthday party will be on Valentine's Day...hope there is a good turn out.

      Before I resign to my ever tedious homework, I thought I would reflect on my last year.  I know it sounds corny...but hey, the writer in me finds it important to sum up my last year.  First of all, I cannot believe I am going to be 27 in a couple of hours.  I am only 3 years from 30.  Where the hell did the time go?  On the upside, Ed and I will be celebrating 9 years of being together...and well, that is a long time, especially since a lot of people who went out as long as we did, didn't make it...a couple did though...  This time last year my husband was taken away from me to go fight in a war.  I was scared and proud all at the same time...the first part of being 26 was filled with a lot of anxiety.  What I learned when I was 26 was the importance of God in our lives and more importantly the the importance of family.  My family really pulled together for me when Ed left.  They helped me through the last few days of my pregnancy, my labor and delivery (all of which I am sure they will not want to expereince again...maybe my mom still wants to be in the delivery room for the next one...my sisters however will rather enjoy the comforts of the waiting room), and the ups and downs of Ed being in the war.  I learned just how irreplaceable Ed is in my life.  I relaized how incomplete my life would be without him...when I heard a missile barely missed them I realized that life is way too precious to let it slip by.  I thank God every day for keeping him safe and bringing him back home to see our beautiful Emily Love.  Oh and how can I not talk about my Emily Love...she was the easiest baby to bring into this world.  She is special just like her brother and sister...she scared me when she was just born, but she got well and has not had any complications since.  She reminded me of just how blessed and fortunate I am in my life.   I am surrounded by very precious people who are worth more to me than anything else in my life, my husband, my children, my parents and my sisters....I alos learned that the few friends I do have truly have become my family and God could not have blessed me more...His blessings in my life are abundant and I learned that more being "26."  I also had my share of losses, I lost some friends, some hope, and well my little child.  The latter I am still coping with, but am sure that the angels are with him or her...and they are watching over all of us, especially the children...but with those losses came enlightenment.  So all in all despite my many hardships this year came a lot of growth, understanding and realization that are important to my development as a person, wife, mother, daughter and sister.  I learned a lot about myself, who I want to be and who I don't want to be.  I learned that having dreams doesn't mean they will be dreams forever and that getting to dreams isn't always a walk in the park, but it doesn't mean you should give up.  I learned that letting go is the key to going on.  Never hold on to something that isn't there.    But the greatest lesson of love has impacted my life the most.  My love for Ed, my children, my parents, my sisters, and some of my friends have deepened with all the events that have happened in this year.  I know they are irreplaceable in my life...and with this I end my last log being 26.  I look forward to a year of new awareness, new findings, new experiences, new memories, even new heartaches, and more importantly a year of more personal achievements.  I must acknowledge Jessica and Leila for the early burthday presents...thank you I enjoyed them.  jessica for taking me and my family out to dinner...it meant a lot to me, I was feeling down and the night out really brought my spirits up...Leila, your words mean so much more to me than anything you could ever buy.  I hope next year you paint me something.  I don't care...I have always been your number 2 (I know mom is number 1) admirer of your work...I know that now that you have finally followed your calling, you will go far...I look forward to seeing and owning some of your beautiful creations...your love and support has truly gotten me througha lot, but especially through this year...Kathleen (who I know will probably never read this because I have not given her the link)...I love you more than you know and it is my greatest hope you one day realize that.  Thank you to all of you who have impacted my life so greatly, especially Ed...you have given me a life I could only dream of, a love so real it scares me sometimes but thrills me most of the time, arms that hold me tight when I am sad and scared, a heart to remind me of what is important in life, children who fill my life with endless happiness, and the promise of more things beautiful to come...thank you for enriching my life with love and happiness.  I love you all!

      I pride myself in taking care of my family, both my own family and the one I come from...so maybe the latest antics of my so called sister PAINS me to no end.  One day I hope she realizes all I have sacrificed for her, all I gave up for her, to help her.  I hope one day she turns around and sees her friends gone and realize she gave up her family for no reason.  Thank you for the early birthday gift...thanks for reminding me just how important family is and just how sad ignorance really is.

      SO they found a small area in my brain that theya re concerned about.  But here is the optimisitic part of it, in 4 out of 10 people, this is normal.  So not to worry.  But the docotr was kind enough to explain that there is a slim chance that it may be the early stages of a neurological disorder, such as MS...but that won't be known until they see another later MRI.  So in 6-12 months we will know if it is just the way my brain is supposed to look or something else.  In the mean time they are going to be treating me for migraines.  I have yet to try my meds because frankly I was not feeling well enough yesterday to stay in the line for my prescriptions.  Ed will go get them today, so I am sure everything will be okay.    Thanks for the prayers.

      I have to say a special thank you to  Heidi  again because she has made this year so much easier having her in my corner and lifting me up when I am down.  I constantly reminded of the good she brings into my life and how invaluable she is to me.   THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART!  That card really made me think and really lifted my spirits, so thank you.  I have lost so many friends in the past few years, I hope to not lose anymore because the few I sincerely cherish.  OK that's it.

      I don't know what they found, but it was small.  My FRICKIN' doctor didn't call me back.  I AM PISSED!  I only know that they found something small because Ed was able to check it out, but he isn't a doctor and can't read some of the stuff.  But it said something about it mostly being normal with a small finding...I don't know.  So yes for all of you who know me well know I am wiggin' and well the dang headaches which were going away are coming back again in pretty serious intensity levels.  UGH  HELP ME PLEASE!  I am so tired of this, missing all kinds of school work.  I am tired guys.  Just tired.

      Well, one correction...when I said I fell for only 2 people...I needed to clarify...I was infatuated with 2 people...Ed being one and the other is the same person in the previous post....I needed to clarify that the other guy was a great infatuation, but it wasn't love...Ed has been the solitaire love of my life....in my heart no one has ever compared to him.  He is my perfect mate...SAPPY  But I have known him for almost 15 years...and been together for 9 years...and married for 7.  So it means a lot.  Maybe that is why the person is bitter...maybe the person was madly in love with her gf.  I don't know, but dang...let go...live a healthy ADULT life and maybe you will be able to move on and find your perfect match...No one said it would be easy, but this wasn't her first love and it won't be her last.  First loves are hard to forget.  Thank goodness I didn't have to forget my first love...LOL  Okay enough procrastinating for me, must do my homework now.

      I still have yet to figure out how to get rid of the funky A on my layout...but have not figured it out...so you guys will just have to deal with it...LOL  I was reading a friend's blog.  It saddens me that people carry around hate.  I know how it feels to truly dislike a person and what the person stands for, but you can't always get along with others.  I know that.  I don't want it to seem that I am not open to that, I am.  Yes I joke around about how I HATE her...but I don't.  I just don't agree with a lot of things she stands for.  But to say I hate her...no...I don't.  Our personalities just don't mesh well.  I put up with her though.  Oh well...my sister loves her, so my sister has to come first, before the dislike.  Well I understand the situation and why this certain person hates my sister...but geez...you're 27 years old now, let go of the hate and grow up.  I have had more people screw me over in bigger ways but I have had to grow and admit that there is nothing I can do to change what happened.  I am just annoyed because I didn't like this person to begin with, but was nice to her because she was my sisters' friend...and now she keeps playing this frickin' pity card and it is bugging me.  It is sad because I see people my age or older and they don't do anything with their lives.  They just stay in this party mode and act like they are still in high school.  HELLO high school was about 10 years ago...GROW UP!  I am just so tired of hearing about this drama.  It is so annoying and over petty ridiculous things.  Maybe because it didn't happen to me.  But hey, I've been played before.  The one guy I fell for in high school, the one who I clicked with at so many levels played me along...I always thought things would work out, but he had a girlfriend when he was going out with me...LMAO  Shoot, I remember being devastated.  I have only fallen for two people in my life him and Ed....maybe because he was so similar to Ed....and I liked that...we clicked at the same level...anyway he made me believe that we had something, but i was just the cool girl he could hang out with and do things with without the ties...oh well.  Lesson learned...and it is okay because I ended up with the one I wanted to be with all along and we have been happy ever since...  But my point was that I never hated the girl he was with.  Why?  She didn't do anything to me.  He just digged her more and wanted the relationship with her.  Of course I was hurt...but it was between him and I...and she didn't have anything to do with it.  So when you have a falling out in a relationship, don't blame anyone but the two involved...because it was the two of you who didn't make it work.  I guess that is what I am trying to say.  By the way, that was 10 years ago...damn...long time ago.  So yeah, I was thinking about going down to see my sister, but I can't drive, I still feel dizzy.  i don't know what it is...I hope they figure this thing out.  It was nice having her around.  I think it is healthy for her to live on her own.  I think that she is growing up now and finally doing things for herself.  That is a very important lesson for people to learn.  Oh geez...I am 27.  I don't feel it though.  I mean I do physically...but not mentally.  LOL  I am in denial, I guess.  I don't know.  Time sure does fly by.  Everything is so amazing, isn't it?  Okay, enough of my rambling.  I should get going.  I think the kids are finally done with their bath.  Nothing like hugs from clean smelling kids...LOL

      So before I go to bed...well not reallly, more like before I go to bed, take my Oceanography book and immerse myself in currents and gyres...I thought I would offer on last thought.  Life is difficult, full of twists and turns.  I know I have had my share, gosh at this point I am probably getting dizzy from all the twists and turns on the road I have chosen...but it doesn't kill you.  I think I have to remember that.  I won't die.  i can do this and get through.  The headaches aren't too bad.  But they are still there...I limit my vicodine intake.  I don't want to rely on those for the rest of my life.  UGH  So I try and ride it out and do other things.    Take care everyone and a very good nite to all.

I wish we had the "know how" to have walked away fromt he deal losing 2 grand instead of thousands more...but in your head you think...2 grand is a lot...and don't see that you will ose mor ein the long run...  Anyway, ramblings...ramblings of a tired person trying to make sense of everything while sanity and hope crumbles around.  I will be okay, I will come through this...and well all I wonder about is when...now would be a good time.

      I didn't like the MRI, it is loud, cold and kind of scary.    Anyway because my numbskull doctor is out of town, I won't get the result until Monday of next week.  Oh joy!  Anyway, we will see.  The reults should be there though.  I am optimisitic that all this will be resolved and everything will be okay.  I got an A on my first paper.  He only handed out 4 A's and I had one of them.  WOOHOO.    Anyway, that was more an ego thing.  i do want to one day pursue writing...but when I will be able to will be a whole other story.  One day, right?  Well I hope you are all doing well adn that life is treating you kindly.  I want to go o ut with Ed and see a movie...too bad we don't have any money for that.  Oh well..

      Okay, I am not scared....okay I am.  2 Vicodines aren't helping the headaches...and for those who have taken the med, you know how strong it is.  I really don't know what is wrong, but I hope it is nothing but stress induced ailment.  I just always dread tests.  I am going to hang out in the van for most the day while Ed takes Bailey on a field trip.  I am sure it will be okay.  I HOPE it will be okay.  Wish me luck.  My MRI is at 4, so I should be back on here posting...on second thought, I don't know when because Ed has class.  Anyway, we'll see.  Only one car again, teh civic is acting up...anyone have  car they can loan us?  Take care everyone.

      By the way...Curie...it's all good...I don't care...I doubt anyone will find my thoughts interesting...aside from my wonderful friends and sisters...lol  I think even they get bored every now and then.  I am kind of scared to go through this MRI thing.  I am such a baby when it comes to getting treatment for me...lol...oh but I am okay with having babies.  How funny.  I guess because I know all the pain and hardwork of labor brings about a wonderful little person.  I love children and I hope one day Ed and I can afford to have another one.  I didn't think I would want four, but after getting pregnant the fourth time and losing the baby.  I think I realized that I do want more children.  It just isn't the time for them.  I guess I also want my parents to be surrounded by their grandchildren...but my sisters are taking forever to get knocked up...LOL  just kidding...but after seeing child birth first hand they have both opted to not have children...  Ed found out he may not leave in June, but in September.  I am mad about that because that means they would have to fly him out instead of him being on a ship for two months and in Iraq for 4 months.  He would fly into Iraq and stay anywhere between 6-9 months and then fly back home.  It is just too unstable in the middle east.  i want my honey to be okay...honey...oh he wants that DVD bad...hmm...I should get it for him.  Anyway, that is the boring blog of the day.  Hope you are all having a wonderful week.

      I think I am doing a little bit better.  I am still very dizzy.  I don't know what is causing this, maybe too much stress.  I don't know, but I do know that the medication doesn't help...teh vicodine helps the headaches because it knocks me out.  We had a nice visit with Kathleen.  although, I don't approve of her calling me Lanie....call it an ego thing, I EARNED the title ATE.  So yes, I demand that it be used frequently.  Hell it is the one luxury given to me by this family.  I might as well enjoy it.  I guess I got it from my parents. I always thought it was cool that they respected my mom and dad so much they always referred to them as ate and kuya.  My mom is younger than some of my dad's siblings, but out of their respect to my dad, they call his wife ate.  I want that for me and Ed.  I think it is cool when I hear Nalani tell non-family people that her kuya this and her kuya that...it is just a great sign of respect that I want my children, grandchildren, etc. to have...I don't care if they marry into another race or what.  Okay, anyway, I better get back to my essay.  I love you guys and thanks for all the well wishes.  I am sure God will take care of me and that this will all be resolved soon.  I will keep you guys updated with my condition.

      Hello all...  I am getting ready to go to the ER.  Yesterday, when I went to my appointment, they couldn't find out what was causing my vertigo and headaches, so they scheduled me for an MRI and gave me meds.  All of which have not helped and actually I have been feeling worst.  i don't know what is wrong.  They said I may have a neurological problem.  Anyway...say a little prayer for me.  I love you all.

      ...So most of you know my dad comes around once a year.  I miss him so much.  I think for the most part I will always be a daddy's girl.  I love my papa with all my heart and with all that I am.  I know he isn't perfect and maybe my sisters are cringing as they read this, but as much as I hate what he did...I still love him.  I know they do too.  Maybe I have conditioned myself to TRY and not think about it.  I still do and I still wonder...but holding on to that anger won't do me any good.  I think that is what my mom does...maybe it is a coping method I am learning from her.  Anyway, hearing his voice and concern over my health reminded me of how much I still need and want his attention...sometimes I fell as if I am overlooked...like they know I stick around so sometimes they look past me...but talking to him today reminded me of the old papa I used to call everyday at work to talk.  When I was pregnant with Bailey I would call him every day at work.  We would talk for a few minutes everday because my papa hates talking on the phone.  I remember how comforting it was to talk to him.  That is what it gelt like...and it hasn't felt like this in a long time.  So it was nice to talk to him.  I do miss him...his chinky smile...his harsh remarks...his corny jokes...our meaningful talks...our not so meaningful talks...his rude remarks....his funny remarks...his presence.  I miss his presence in our lives....I am sad that he is missing out on my kids.  I always wanted my kids to have a relationship with their grandparents because that is the one thing I lacked in.  Thank God they have my mom.  Well I should end this now...sorry if this was a little gloomy....I just miss my dad.  I grew up with him being gone a lot...I guess I just always thought he would be around when I had my family...and he ends up missing just as much of it....good nite...I should get some rest because I have an appointment to go to.  Been experiencing bad vertigo and headaches...so we shall see what is wrong with me this time...UGH  I love you all for taking some time to read my boring thoughts and ramblings...

      Bailey had a nice day at school, he got invited to have lunch with Father Pat.  It was amazing to hear the nice things that the other parents had to say about Bailey.  They were amazed because the top fuundraisers were al male and Bailey was the only one kind enough to include one female.  I am so proud of him.  He is such a treasure, the greatest gift from God.  That is all I have to say tonight.  I have so much homework to do that I haven't done yet.  UGH.  Procrastination is a bad bad habit I wish I didn't fall victim to.

      It has been along time since I have been happy.  But I am. I had the good news yesterday about getting a job.  My relationship with my sister is great.  It is a give and take relationship and it is nice to know that if things fail in life, we have each other.    Then I am reminded constantly of the wonderful friends I have...of course, Heidi who has pretty much gotten me through this rough year...I mean not very many friends fly out thousands of miles with family to come and see you...there aren't very many friends willing to do that.  I am so blessed with her.  Then another good friend who has always been there, but I sometimes neglect with my busy life...but still remains friends with me...Curie.  When I was dealing with Bailey's condition she is the one who helped me through it and kept reminding me just how strong I really was...well she has some happy news for herself that I won't share with everyone.  Just know girl, that I love you and am so happy for you.  I have wonderful kids...very intelligent and beautiful children who I adore more than anything.  I have a husband who loves me completely and will move heaven and earth to see me happy.  I have a mother who drives me nutty, but loves me and more importantly my children more than life.  I have an uncle who is more like a father to me since my father is never around anymore.  He provides all the love and support I lack in life.    I am just so happy to have such wonderful people in my life and for the first time in a long time I know completely how extremely blessed and undeserving I am to have all this love surrounding me.

      I must recommend to all of you to buy Schindler's List.  I think it was the first movie that made me cry and to really think about what I am fortunate to have.  I am going to wacth it in a few minutes, but I thought I would remind you about this movie.  I remember watching it in high school and being completely moved by it.  Oh high school, so long ago....  Damn...10 year union around the frickin' corner...and here I thought I would be done with college...LMAO  Well I got the family down...college is almost there.  NITE!

      I was having trouble sleeping and I think I ended up crying myself to sleep.  The financial hardships are starting to get the better of us.  UGH  I love going to school, but am wondering if I am going to be able to afford it.  I hate having to resort to student loans, but I honestly want to finish school and unfortunately I cannot fund my school on my own.  I am trying to find some sort of job though.  So I am not just lounging around wanting money to fall into my lap...sometimes I do....but not all.  I have more respect for those who went through college on their own.  More power to you guys.  I will be paying for my college forever and a day, but hey, if I get it done right?  Thankfully when I do enroll for my 4-year, my dad's VA thing will kick in and then I won't have to worry so much.  Well I better get going.  I have a ton of stuff to do around the house, like find FOOD.  It has to get better right?  It will.  Oh, I got distracted...I wanted to say that last night I prayed to God to come into my heart and that I surrendered my problems to Him.  I told Him that I needed help and that I knew that He would help me in my time of need, as He always has in my life.  I just had to let go and let Him come into my life.  I felt better after that.  I don't know why I let myself go far from the Church.  I need to go back and not worry about what the pious think of me.  I know my sins and acknowledge my wrongs and have confessed them to God.  I know He has forgiven me and will not dispose of me.  Sorry, I didn't mean to go on and on about this spiritual note.

      I wanted to start off by saying that I wish I had never bought this house.  I LOVE THE HOUSE.  I love where we live...I never thought I would say this, but at what cost?  My mom has been having bad relapses since us buying this house....looks like the doctors are a little concerned about her.  They are doing another MRI on her.  I can tell she is nervous about it.  I HATE my cousin for doing this to us, for risking my mom's health fo rhis financial benefit.  I hope he gets back all he has given us and then some.

       THANK GOD FOR SPRING BREAKS!   Okay well I think I am doing better now.  I went to school yesterday and had the worst coughing attack.  UGH  I think a week of rest is in order...so thank goodness it is Spring break.  So anyway, I have been a little annoyed with Ed.  Only because he is such an intelligent person, but he has little or no faith in himself.  Therefore just settling on the idea that he isn't a great student.  Mind you, this guys has a 3.6 average.  He is so brilliant, I wish there were something I could do to make him realize that.  Maybe I am just going on and on because I know his potential and that he isn't making the most of the gifts he is blessed with.  I wish school came easy to me.  It used to.  I remember in high school, things just seemed to fall into place, but in college I have to bust my butt.  I currently have a C in Math, but am confident that I can finish that class with a B.  My English class I should be able to pull a B...and Oceanography I MAY be able to pull a C.  That class is a lot harder than you think, it has the chemistry, physics, geology, biology all tied into it.  So it is like taking all those classes at once.   Here I thought it would be easier.  I think I understood the Chemistry at UCSC more than I understand this stuff here.  Maybe I don't read enough.  I love school.  I think with all the stresses in my life, I just can't concentrate.  I wish more than anything someone would pay for my college and then I wouldn't have to worry about the financial aspect.  I know, wishful dreaming.  It is just so hard when you have to worry about the financial aspect.  I realized I am not so much a dreamer, but a realist.  I know my limits and it is sad because maybe I could achieve greater things if I didn't have the burden of financial woes.   Anyhow, I have a job interview to take pictures of people at Legoland.  Is it the job I had hoped for?  HELL NO!  But it is a job, I did get a call back and will have an interview, so at this point I cannot be choosy.  Life must go on and I must make ends meet here before we lose our home.  Well Emmy needs changing really bad...so maybe later today or next time...    Sidenote:    Thank you Heidi for the card.  It is special friends like you who remind people that life isn't that bad.  No matter what I may lose in life, I am confident that I will not lose my friendship with you.  Oh and by the way, Nalani still hasn't made the perfect picture to send to Cousin Sydney, although she thinks her Kuya's pictures look rather nice to send.  LOL  We miss you all.

      Well, despite my current health issues, I am attempting to do my homework.  Let me just say this.  I think that if you are sick from pneumonia, it must be pretty serious, so you should cut your student some slack.  UGH  I have a rough draft of an essay due and there is no way I can even attempt to turn anything in because I wasn't in class when they went to the library to do the research.  UGH  I hate being sick and being sick around the time papers are due are the worst.  Anyway, I needed to vent.  I have to try to finish what I can.  Not to mention, my aunt's cousin died and we are going to the wake and the funeral.  =(

      I forgot to post this...  So I was thinking, Ed is gone today..he is helping his friend tile a house.  That is okay...I guess that's cool.  We NEED the extra money...but I guess what is really getting to me is that I want to be pampered when I am sick.  I swear, when I am sick, I have to do everything.  I know, the job of mommy.  Well and then I was thinking, he is leaving again soon.  By June, he will be returning to Iraq.  Am I ready for him to go?  No.  With Americans dying there everyday, how can you prepare yourself for something like that?  I mean, yeah...DRAMATIC....I am just saying, he is such  a HUGE part of my life, HUGE part of me.  I can't imagine him not being with me...I can't imagine raising our children without him.  These are the things no woman likes to think of, but a military wife always has in the back of her mind.  I know that God will forever keep us under His care.  Okay, well goodnight everyone...that was the last thought roaming around my medicated mind.

      Oh goodness...  I read my sister's post every now and then...funny sometimes...  Anyway, I hope she gets a place of her own soon, so she can live her life and deal with her own responsibilities and not have to worry about the pressures of being around kids.  I love having her around, but it is time for her to live her own life too.  So I hope she gets into the 4 year college of her dreams and is able to get a place of her own...WHEN SHE IS READY...no pushing here...  I am not feeling well at all.  I have SO MUCH HOMEWORK to do too.  I am so stressed out.  I need to gte better so I can kind of concentrate on homework.  I have to take Stitch to get his stitches out.  Him and his girlfriend are trouble.  They are getting into everything and Kawaii is the ring leader teaching him how to tear up them boxes in the garage.  I hope they don't get to the kids' books...if they do, well I don't know what else to do with them.  Having a dog is tough, I mostly wanted it for the kids and Ed.  It will be fun when Ed is gone and I have to clean up after Stitch...YUCK  Well have a good one guys...

       Pneumonia?   Oh no!  Yeah, you read that right, I am in the beginning stages of pneumonia.  I am not feeling so well, so this won'tbe very long.  I hope you are all doing well.  I was happy yesterday, my other best friend, one of my oldest friends next to Ed and Tim...Keiko e-mailed me.  Unfortunately her car got broken into.  She has been having one helluva time as well.  I am glad to hear that she has found some happiness again.  I hope this time it works out for her.   I miss my friends.  I wish I lived closer to all of them, some days I feel so isolated, especially these past few weeks....when life seems to be so complicated.  It would be nice to be able to go out for one hour with a friend and forget about the problems that plague me.  Good night to the 3 of you who read this, I hope you all enjoyed the beautiful day.

      I am so  SICK  today.  I had a very nice conversation with my very good friend Heidi.  I thank God she is in my life, especially the past few months.  It is a sad thing to think you have to go through things alone....but she always makes sure I don't walk through these problems alone.  She is always standing by me and reassuring me that I will get through all this and for some reason, when she says I can get through it, I start believing that I can.  I am so blessed with such wonderful people in my life.  I have to just remember that.  So the dookie is about to hit the fan...my cousin is about to receive word that my mom has filed official charges against him.  I am sad it has come to this, but we are in a very bad way and he won't communicate with us like adults.  I only hope that his family understands and sees where we are coming from....but that may be wishful thinking on my part.  Thanks to my personal cheerleader Heidi, I am in good spirits...a good friend can do that for you.   THANK YOU GOD FOR HEIDI!   Thanks to the many others who have kept me in their thoughts and in their prayers...I love you all.

      I was very disheartened this morning with the news of more drama.  I don't need anymore.  I must say I was very very upset, but have ironed things out with my sister.  I HOPE she understands and has absorbed our conversation and knows where my true feelings are in the matter.  I hope she gives me the same respect as I am giving her and to not judge each other anymore because in the end we are not in each other's shoes.  I must say I was let down by a friend.  A firend that could have shed light onto the situation.  Will I revoke a friend's certain status?  Hell no, I am am not like that.  But I considered her a part of the family...when she heard of my sister's feelings, there was a clear opportunity to shed light on the subject, but she didn't.  Yes it isn't her job, but she could have bettered the situation if she would have just clarify that her family does not hold ill feelings toward her.  She knew that better than anyone....so that friend, your failure to act has made me question whether your intentions to be my friend are true.  I love my family and have shared my loss of friends, some closer to me than most people and some just mere acquaintances, but all losses in my heart.  I would hate to lose more over trivial things.  I hope that in life we all understand that sometimes silence is more poisonous than speaking out.

      So anyway, life as we know it, goes on....  Ed may not have to leave as soon as we thought.  Thank goodness.  I am struggling to get my work done so that I can finish my only class (online) and just be done.  I love spending time with my kids, I miss them when I am not around them.    Anyway,  I will write more about the Christening and stuff...later....

      Here I am thinking again...I think it is because Ed is sleeping and I am caught watching him again.  There are going to be three weddings this year, the first is for Mary and Stuart...CONGRATS TO THEM!  Then a couple of Ed's friends...or a few of Ed's high school friends...how exciting.  I love weddings.  I was thinking, I won't even be in a wedding...well I don't think my sisters will have traditional weddings, so...lol  i am SOL on them.  Oh well.  Anyway, I hope everyone is well.

      I am supposed to be cleaning my very messy house.  I mean, hello, we are having a party here on Sunday...but I can't bring myself to cleaning.  I am in some weird funk that I can't seem to bring myself out of.  The past few nights I haven't been sleeping well.  My thoughts are on Ed and my family...where are we headed from here?  What is going to happen?  UGH  I fall asleep watching Ed sleep, in his arms, listening to his heart beat.  The rhythm soothes my worried soul and everything is okay.  I keep telling myself everything will be okay, he has a job to do and he will be back and I will look back at all this and wonder why I made such a big fuss.  Scared...hell yeah I am scared.  Who wouldn't be in my shoes?  I keep thinking stay positive...but it has greatly affected my mood and me.  Not sleeping is making me sleep late...I am so tired and moody and tired...lol  TIRED  that is the perfect way to describe me.  AHHHH!  My father in law will be here in less than 24 hours and I have so much to do...so DO IT!!!  Someone kick me in the butt already...  Okay, I needed to vent.  I am tired of being scared and just when I thought I was over it, night time comes and I watch him sleep and all the fear comes gushing back to me.   Well I better get going...thanks.

      I needed to vent because I don't know if it is because I am cycling or what, but I have a lot of pent up frustrations with everything but most of all me.  I know this is going to come off as me whining and I don't mean it to be, but I AM TIRED.  No, I take that back.  I am exhausted.  There is only one thing I regret in my life and that is finishing my education because now it has to take a back burner to my life.  But I love my children and my family and wouldn't trade them for anything but I feel more and more that they deserve more than what I can give them.  In a couple of weeks I will be interviewed for a scholarship.  I am so flattered and so excited, but know that I will have to tell them that I have taken a medical withdrawal from school.  I am glad I took it because there are a lot of things I need to face that I haven't been facing and on top of that list are my kids.  My mom is raising them and it isn't right.  So I am taking mor eonline classes to be home more and moving to a different school.  I love the school I have been in, but my family has to come first.  The awful thing about moving out here.  I love the house, hate the commute...and well miss being so close to everything.  I see and hear about my friends and they are long done with college and working in their careers and here I am still struggling to get the first half done...what is wrong with me?  Why can't I just be done with it...why can't I just finish a damn semester without having any medical problems?  UGH  I HATE THIS FEELING.  Anyway, I better get back down to schooling Bailey.  Just pray that God shows me the path I need to take.  I feel like I am losing my way.

      Well Ed and I fought today.  I hate fighting with him and lately when we do fight it is over very trivial things that I hate fighting about even more.  The thing is, I am on my period and well things here aren't that great...well financially speaking and we try not to make a big deal out of it, but it sucks when you can't even really go out without wondering if you are making some kind of mistake by going out....like damn, should we be using this money?  Trust me, we HARDLY go out.  That is why I am so happy when people give us gift certificates for any occasion, it is the one chance we get to go out and do something for ourselves.  How sad is that?  Anyway, I had so much fun with my in-laws.  Things weren't always that great, in fact things were pretty bad.  But thing are great now and that is what counts.  IT was a very long and rocky road.  I haven't been sleeping all that well because I know Ed is going back to that hell hole they call Iraq where our soldiers are dying left and right and now that the marines are taking over and taking care of business, that means Ed is there too.  I am scared because this time he won't be posted on some base (headquarters) like he was last year during the war.  He is going to be in Iraq with the crazy people.  I am so overwhelmed that I am beginning to cry when I think of that place.  I am so sad for those people, the way they have lived their lives, the fear they felt and now the uncertainty that surrounds them.  Yes, we are westerners.  I see why they are skeptical, we could bring more harm to them than Saddam (in their eyes) but I honestly don't think that is what being a REAL American is really about.  The heart of Americans isn't beating to dictate the world.  I think they really don't even want to have to regulate the world...unfortunately our politicians do.  Unfortunately for us family members of these military personnel, wait and wonder what will be next.  No one sees our loved ones, they see what they stand for.  They don't see the fathers, mothers, sons and daughters that they are....the family that they sacrifice for not only our freedom, but for the freedom of others.  But is it worth it when these people do not want to be freed.  So are we freeing them?  I don't know.  A bunch of rambling of a tired mind.  Sorry.

      I must admit I am thoroughly enjoying the visit from my in-laws.  Our past wasn't that great, but I am so happy that it is has grown into a wonderful and very beautiful relationship.  Of course for myself and my sanity, but more importantly for my children and their well being.  I think it is very important for them to know their family.  I am working on my father in law, but he is a little more distant that the other grandparents.  He wasn't really hands on with Ed to begin with.  When I see my children interact with their auntie and uncle and grandparents I see the love they have for each other and it warms my heart.  I guess for the most part because I didn't grow up with a lot of that.  I think that is why I long for that type of relationship for my children...it is one of the things I lacked in my life and I think it is important to hold special memories with your grandparents.  I know the few that I do have with my grandmothers, I hold very near and dear to my heart.  So anyway, just to update and let you know how wonderful my visit with my in-laws is going.  I know the kids are going to miss them so much when they leave again.  It is too bad we live so far from them now.   I hope you all had a wonderful Easter.

      I wanted to take the time to pay my respect to all the families who have recently lost a loved one, especially those in the military.  I have just read that fifteen men died from Camp Pendleton and I am sure that many of those men have wives and children they are leaving behind.  I think that this hits me hard because the men whohave died come from the group that Ed will be joining this June.  Yes, I am scared.  I am terrified.  This is the worst reality a military spouse must face.  The reality that their loved one may not come bacl  All the feelings I felt when he was gone last year are gushing back and maybe that is why I am unable to sleep.  I find myself watching him sleep and thinking,"God I can't live without you in my life."  That is how much I love Ed.  Yes he drives me crazy and yes some days I want to strangle him.  But I cannot honestly see myself without him.  He is such a huge part of me, a huge part of my life.  Then I see and hear about these families who do lose their loved ones and I think to myself, how do they do it?  I hope and pray I never have to expereince what they experienced because I honestly do not know if I would have the strength and the will to move on.  I am sorry this was so sad.  I just read the news and imagined that that could easily be us and that is scary.  Gives new meaning to live for today and enjoy because tomorrow is not guaranteed.

      Yet another night I am unable to sleep.  I took a medical withdrawal from my classes.  I am so bummed because I thoroughly enjoyed my professors this semester an even though they were a challenge for me, I loved my classes.  I ADORE my English professor.  I think that any professor who is able to widen your horizon and broaden your understand and cultivate your thoughts is an AWESOME teacher. I want to be just like him.  I am truly sad that I won't have him next semester.  Although, I may just take one class at Palomar just to have him as a professor.  I loved his class.  Anyhow...nothing new, bad headache episodes and so they think I may have severe complex migraines and may need to give myself injections if they aren't remedied.  GREAT!  With my fear of needles too.  Oh well, let's hope the meds work for now.

      I read somewhere that accentuating the positives in your life would dim the negatives.  So in my inability to sleep because of the constant thought my my head problems, I am going to generate a list of the positives of the past year or so.    Positives    *Emily Love was born. *Ed came back home to us safely. *Bailey is continuing to do well healthwise. *We have a beautiful home. *God has reminded us of the valuable friends and family we have. *Our continued health. *Ed getting his AA. *I am back at school.  I am sure there are many more things I have forgotten.  The top few are enough.  I have been blessed with an amazing family and that alone is enough.  By the birth of my children and by the saving of Ed during that war He has shown me that I am not forgotten.  I think in the hustle and bustle of life we get consumed by our fear.  Maybe that is what has paralyzed me.  Maybe my fear has made it hard for me to function as I should.    As I write this, I realize that I have to put my faith in God's will for me and my future.  I have to have faith in His love for me and my family.  I have to have faith in God.  If I lose faith in God I lose everything.  So in this journey before me, I will have faith in God and what He has planned for me.  I pray for strength and courage.  I didn't mean to get so spiritual, but something is renewed in me.  There is a peace that is settling within me and calming my tortured soul.  With that, I pray that you all never lose faith in God and always relaize His presence in our lives.  I am embarrassed to say that through all this I almost lost sight of that.   Have a great week.  I am sure mine will be better.

      You know how you have those friends that you can just randomly reconnect with and everything is all good?  I have a few of those.  One of them is Mrs. Trisha.  I met her during my brief stint at UC santa Cruz.  I must admit I left that school because I didn't feel like I belonged...lol  The sorority I wanted to pledge for didn't show very much interest in me.  lol  So I just took it as a sign that I didn't belong.    Leaving UCSC was a good and bad thing...good because it was the start of the life I have now, bad because I think I missed out a lot on the growing up stuff everyone should experience.  I have been to a club maybe 10 times and I think that might be stretching it.  I have yet to get drunk, but I don't think that will happen since I don't like to drink, really.  Oh and forget smoking anything.  YUCK!  (sorry for all the smokers out there).  So I am just a plain Jane.  Anyway, I am going to her daughter's first birthday and I am so excited about it.  i finally get to meet her baby.  Our daughters are like us, just a month apart.  I look forward to our daughters becoming friends.  When I first met her I thought she was a snob...lol  Let me back track....lol When I first saw her I was happy because there was another filipino there.  lol  I thought my roomie was chinese, but she was filipino too.  haha  Anyway she ended upbeing the sweetest, cookiest drama queen ever.  I love her for her spunkiness.  lol  Life, however short lived it was, at UCSC was definitely tolerable and FUN with her.  You ahve to ask erh about her freshman roomie...lol  Now she was a TRIP!    I have nothing but smiles right now Trish...that post was for you.  I know you remember some of our kookie moments there...too many memories too precious for me to forget.  I love you and thanks for everything. :D

      I have decided my problem is that I don't make friends too easily...I am too caught up with not making the right ones, not wanting to lose friends again.  I need to snap out of it and make new friends and hopefully going to this new junior college will help me with that.  It is right down the street so i will meet more people around this area.  I just need to meet people I can go out with and stuff.  So I was thinking, my problem with going to the gym is I know I am overweight and I am super self conscious about my weight.  I have a wedding to go to in a little over amonth and everyone will be staring at me and telling how FAT I still am.  So I want to try and lose a few pounds before that wedding.  I also want to be healthy.  I don't eat a lot but I don't do a lot either.  So after I do a hour or so of homework, I am going to do some major cleaning.  I have taken my meds and it is kind of working.  We will see.  Take care    HAPPY BIRTHDAY MICA!    Join the 27 club!  Damn we are getting old...we all need to do something BIG the year we turn 30!

      I am sad today...  Money...but when is it not money?  I have been so consumed on the money problems I am just degenerating before my eyes...I HATE BEING OVERWEIGHT!  But I don't know how to get out of this slump.  I know what I need to do to lose the weight, but I come up with excuse after excuse...well lately, they have been real excuses, I haven't been feeling well with the vertigo and headaches...  I don't know how I got here...I want to get out though.  I hate being heavy.  Anyway, I am done.

      Okay, so this is my second post for the evening. I thought I would post since I got the kiddos to bed.  No easy task.  Let me tell ya, they will fight until their eyes are all red and practically closed.  Anyway, I am watching the Iron Chef.  Ed and I love watching this show.  I would love for ne day to be able to cook like these people.  You know, to just be able to whip something up together without having some recipe to consult.  Oh that would be wonderful.  Although most of the things I do cook now wasn't through some recipe book, but from just throwing things together and well they aren't as bad as I make them out to be...MOST OF THE TIME!  I was a little sad today.  Depressed, more like it.  The baby would have been close to being here...if not here by now.  =*(  I know that everything happens for a reason.  I would like to have one more child.  People are going to read this and laugh, but I think that when I have a stable job I wouldn't mind having more children.  I don't want to sound like that si all I want in life, it isn't.  I just love children and I love watching them grow.  I also knwo that my parents love children adn have loved being grandparents.  I think my kids have kept my mom fighting and allowed her not to give up on life.  I am happy to be able to give her that.  Plus my children are the reasons why I am who I am today.  They have each taught me a strength that I don't know if anyone else could have taught me.  I love those kids.  I was thinking today how lucky I am to have Ed.  I love Ed.  He is such a wonderfula dn loving husband...so he isn't as romantic as when we were dating, but he loves comepletely and with his whole heart, not only to me, but to my entire family.  WE are so fortunate to ahve him in our lives.  My dad evens sees him as a son and not a son-in-law.  I am starting to feel that with my mother-in-law.  We will be up in the Bay area next weekend for Ed's brother's graduation.  I am excited to go up there, it has been a couple of years since we last went up there.  It should be nice.  Ed was telling me the other day about his brother's prom.  It is funny how things change.  We also learned of his college plans to stay up in northern California.  I feel bad for Ed, he was really looking forward to his brother moving down.  He really misses his siblings.  I feel for him.  I know that I would be lost without my sisters, no matter how batty they may drive me.  I love them and they complete my life.  Well anyway, I think that this is where I should end things.  LOL  I am so sorry to go on and on...I just had some time to write and well, I took it and ran with it.

      Well my mom decided to go out tonight and I thought it would be good for her to do so.  I think that she needs to go out every now and then and I am happy when she is able to.  She went to go see a filipino concert.  I know she was estatic to get the invite. I was happy for her too.  I mean, hello, how often does that happen?  Her godfather from her wedding invited her.  I know that she needed it too.  Anyway, everything has been okay here.  I mean there hasn't been too much drama over here...haha that is always a good thing.  We have had our fair share of drama, you all are probably already bored with that.  So I won't even go there.  I will say that I think things are starting to look up for us.  Oh so let me tell you about my job.  I totally forgot to tell you guys about it.  First, it is killing me.  Since I have been ill with constant migraines and the ongoing battle with my frickin' allergies, well, it has been tough to do things, let alone wake up early in the morning.  Anyway, this job isn't early by regular people's means...lol but early for me.  I come in about nine in the morning and I stay for a couple of hours.  I prepare the children's activities (better known as cutting out projects and labeling them with each child's name) and after that, I help facilitate the children in their ongoing project (also known as pasting, and helping them draw things).    I like this job for many reasons, it is preparing me to have interaction with children, although this is far from the age I would like to teach, it is teaching me the patience to help each child and work with each child.  I think it is also interesting to see children in a school atmosphere.  I see my children on a very daily basis.  LOL  Don't get me wrong, I love them to death, but it is nice to get a break from them and the constant crying and fighting.  Oh Nalani is driving me nutty today.  Anyway, I like it because the children I am working with are fabulous, they are a good mix and well, for the most part, they are well behaved, of course, there are the few who you make you not want to be a teacher, but overall, they are great kids.  I also like the lady who runs the home daycare and can see that her program has a lot of potential.  It takes a special someone to be able to give up their home like that.  I don't like this job because let's be honest, the pay sucks.  LOL  But I guess I get paid every week, so every week I have at least $24...which pays for half of the gas Ed uses to commute.  This job is also a few blocks away, so maybe if I gather enough courage, I will actually bring myself to walk to work...I doubt that, with the Sacramento-like heat we have here.   So we are going to ahve a BBQ, was supposed to be a surprise thing for Kathleen, but that didn't pan out like I wanted it to.  Oh well, life goes on.  She will have fun though.  I think that Magic Mountain is what she has wanted to do for awhile, so that will be fun for her.  Only a handful of people are coming, which is cool by me.  I love it when it is just close intimate friends around.  They truly make the time more enjoyable.  I was reading Leila's blog the other day and read the one about legacy.  I thought about it and thought about it.  There are a lot of things I did in my life with the best of intentions, but am not proud of and am hoping that things will change in me for the better.  I think I have.  I am not as judgemental and not so much a control freak.  I have learned that I cannot control other's lives, no matter how much I think I know of the situation.  I have to just let people live their lives as they let me live my life.  Everyone has to fall and get up on their own.  I have learned that my role is as a friend and not a mother.  I truly miss Keiko and Tim.  Tim drove me nuts, but he loved with his whole heart and completely and he is the most loyal friend out there.  There isnothing he wouldn't do for his friends and I am going to be grateful to him forever.  Keiko is the best listener and the best person to remind me of what is important.  I miss that aspect..now that we aren't so close anymore, I miss that ability to pick up the phone and just call her and talk for hours.  She is a busy career woman now and has so many wonderful things going for her.  I am so very proud of her.  Anyway, I have to put my rugrats to bed, I think the sugar has FINALLY wore off.  Thank goodness for small miracles.  Have a great weekend.

      I went grocery shopping yesterday and let's just say we have a ton of fruits of veggies.  I thought instead of buying pointless snacks, we might as well spend money towards soemthing healthy and good.  Thank goodness for that.  I think I feel a lot better just knowing we have a better diet.  Now we are going to make french toast for the kids with fruits and milk on the side for them.  It is sad, I got so caught up with everything going on in my life, I neglected our eating habits.  I hope you are all doing well.  Oh and I just wanted to congratulate my sister on her 4.0.  I knew you could do it.  I just keep telling you to believe in yourself, if I were half as gifted and as intelligent as you, this college stuff would be a walk in the park.  Also, congrats to Mica for doing well in her classes.  I had no doubts in your ability to do well.  You too just needed to believe in  yourself.  I guess that is the secret to life, the secret to unlocking the dorrs to your potential, is to first believe in yourself...then everything falls into place.  Have a HAPPY Friday everyone.

      *.*  Well the wedding went great.  It was so nice to see so many people.  Although depressing to see others.  Yes my weight again.  I was looking at the pictures and was a little disgusted to see how much I let myself go.  I think for the most part it is all the stress I have been dealing with.  I just am too tired to do anything.  I need to change that.  It is a hard thing to change though, but I want and need to do something before it gets to the point where I can't do anything about it.  Anyway, our "cousin" Leslie looked absolutely beautiful.  She married into a very nice family.  I think they will be happy for a long time.  I hope God continues to bless them and that they have a baby to welcome soon.  I think that would be a great blessing.  Life here is all the same, Ed has leave, he is in btween commands, so it is nice to be around him.  I can't get enough of his presence.  You would think I would go crazy...because truthfully, he presses my buttons like no other, but I love him completely.  He and the kids are everything to me.  I haven't heard from my friends in northern Cal, but I guess they are busy.  It sucks, I wanted to see them.  I guess that won't happen.  Oh well.  I hope they are both doing well.  I miss them.  It is so weird not being able to talk to talk to them.  But I know that is how life goes, people go their separate ways.  i just didn't think it would happen to us.  My Auntie Pistang died.  I was sad.  She was a cousin of my dad's.  He respected her and loved her.  I think he is saddened and hopes for nothing but happiness in heaven.  She took care of her family and I know that God has a special place for her.  My papa is coming home soon!  I can't wait.  I miss him.  Of course he drives me crazy, but he loves me and he worries about me.  I know this much.  Well I hope you are all having a great week.

      Okay, so I had this plan to surprise my sister (who has been feeling pretty left out) SO I thought this would be the perfect way to make herfeel like family again.  but oh no, she has made plans and of course, we weren't included.  SHOCK!  Oh well.  We already invited people and no use in univiting them, right?  I am bummed because even though I know she won't want to go to things, I invite her.  It is just a gesture, you know?  How do you celebrate without family?  UGH  I am not going to stress over it.  It is what it is.  Sucky part is we hear about the plans from someone other than her.  Oh well.  I am kicking myself for even getting all worked up.  It is life, right?  Anyway, I guess it is just me...I have always been glued to my family.  Even when I moved out, I still called my parents almost everyday.  Hell, I even chose to live with my family.  I love being with my family, I feel complete.  Sometimes crazy, but complete.  Seriously.  I hope Ed feels the same, I think he does.  I know he loves my family like his own.  I know that for the most part my family loves him just as much.  Anyway, this turned into a rant and I didn't mean it to.  i just am frustrated because no matter what, I just can't connect with my own sister.  No matter how hard or how little I try.  Goodnite guys.  Oh and I won't be posting for a few days because I am attending my "cousin's" wedding.  WOOHOO!  It's about time.

      I had a great time and having my family there was the icing on the cake.  I was so happy and fortunate to have them there.   I do owe Jessica a HUGE thank you for treating the entire family out to dinner.  She didn't have to.  Thank you so much.  It was fun.  Are you allergic to seafood?  haha  We are very fortunate to maintain friendships with most of Leila's gfs.  They have all been great to have around.  Like I consider Mica, Mary and Amber my friends too, like in some ways my little sisters.  I am so proud of all of them.    Anyway, it was so worth every hardship I had to get to that point.  Walking on the stage adn hearing them talk about me was nice, but the best part was seeing Nalani as I walked back to the chairs and seeing her big smile and saying. "Mommy!"  I think that made the whole situation because it is those three little people who are my driving force.  They inspire me.  Anyway, that is it...I hope you are all having a fantastic week.  I know I am...well minus the money woes, we are having a good week.

      Oh what awonderfully beautiful day.  I just wish that my allergies aren't acting up.  I think that our financial problems with the house may work out.  I won't go into it until everything is final. Life is looking up and slowly I am letting go of the hate I carried in my heart towards my cousin.  Life is too short to hate.  We have to live in the present and enjoy what we have now, not what we lost or what we look forward to having.

      I would like to call this my day.  Today is my award ceremony and i am so happy to have the love and the support of my family.  It will be such an honor to have them there because to be honest with you guys I feel like I am lacking in the "to be proud of" department.  I guess because I am hard on myself for letting everyone down and not being done with college.  I know why I didn't...but still...I have a friend who did it on her own her BS and her Masters...as a single mom without her parents living close to her or without a husband.  She did it and now she is so successful.  Here I am not only having a husband, living with my mom and my sister...HELLO!  So I am so glad to be on the right track and I am glad Leila and I can somewhat motivate each other.  I must admit I don't talk to Kata a lot but it isn't because I don't want to, she works and goes to school.  But she seems to be handling her business well.  I am proud of her.  I still think she could have done big things at a CSU or UC, but that's just me.  Anyway, I will relish this time I have to enjoy my hard work and strive to do better in the following semester...wish me luck everyone.

      Well, I got a job...it isn't the most prestigious, but it pays and more importantly gives me hands on expereince with kids.  That is the main reason why I am taking it.  What is hurting my chances of getting decent jobs is that I don't have hands on expereince with children.  So this is something I am looking forward to.  Like I said, the pay isn't great, hell I think it is under the minimum wage, but it is all under the table and just a few days a week for a couple of hours.  I think it will work out in the long run.  The lady who interviewed me is very nice and the children she has in the program are really well mannered and fun.  I think it is a great opportunity for me to get a great deal of expereince with them.  She has also offered for me to try out some of the lesson plans I have.  So I think that will be cool too.  I just got back, my first real day of work is on Friday, and I am so very excited.  I sound funny...but hey, this will help with Ed's gas money to and from work...that is going to help out.  Things are so tight, it isn't even funny.  Well anyhow, I better get going...I hope you all have a wonderful week.

      Okay so I can't stay ont his so long because we are going to go to a Padres game.  Of course Bailey is super excited.  I am excited too, but I don't know about being in the sun for that long.  Forgive me for not proofing this because I can't see.  I have no glasses for a week and I have to depend on my frickin' contacts.  I haven't put them on yet because they were buggin last night.  So wish me luck today.  Anyway, Ed adn Jess are recovering.  Since Leila and I are both relatively sick, they had to drink while we played Mario Party 5.  haha  Poor Ed, I lost a lot of times.  Leila made me make her drink and I made her a messed up drink that she didn't like so very much.  haha  But she drank it.  I did feel bad, so I put more ice and Sweet and Sour a little later.  Okay, so have a great Sunday everyone.

      I am feeling lazy today.  I think because it is hot and I don't want to turn the a/c on.  I don't know what it is exactly, but I will have to clean up soon.  So why not blog first?   Anyway, the picnic was fun, the people that Ed works with are all wonderful people and I am glad Ed had the opportunity to work with such wonderful people.  I must admit however that the change will be good.  I think one more tour with the Marines and I would like Ed to spend the latter half of his Navy career on the "blue" side.  The "green" side has been kind to us, but I think Ed will further his career on the "blue" side of things.  "Blue" is with the ships and all that stuff, and "Green" is with the Marines.  Anyway my cousin't wedding is next week and I did not lose any weight.  Oh well.  Another time,s o I have to be prepared to field the ever so kind, "Lanie, YOU'RE SO FAT!"  Oh really?  I didn't notice.  lol  Thanks for stating the obvious, can I go now?  Gotta love family.  IT is nice and hot and I should get to work.  I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, all 4 of you who read this.  haha

      This is my second time to write this, I had a very long blog about old friends, but blogger didn't publish it.  UGH  Go figure.  Well, I wanted to blog old friends that have come and gone, but never left my heart.  I guess what sparks this blog is the e-mail I got from a very dear old friend.  As many of you know, I don't have very many friends that I talk with.  I guess when you have three kids and in the military life, you don't have too much to talk about other than your kids and the military life.  I have been thinking about my old friends from high school.  I don't think there have been a group of people that have come to mean so much to me than these people...of course there are exceptions to the rule...lol  But seriously, these people hold a very special place in my heart, that is why they are all godparents to my children.  First there is Keiko.  She was my other half.  I don't think I have shared that type of closeness with anyone else.  I think of her as more my sister than my friend.  I miss her, life had gotten so busy we haven't been able to talk too much, but she is definitely one person I will always have a lot of love and respect for. I am so proud of the woman she has become.  Then there is Megan, who I don't get to talk to too much.  She is a teacher...she is what I want to be when I grow up.  She was always the one to not BS to you, she always told it as it was.  There's Josh, who always inspired me to be my best and who always reminded me that not only was I loved, but that I was stronger than what I thought. He is finishing up with Medicine...how awesome is that?  Then there is Kristian, whom always lent an ear and gave the best hugs (actually I think my circle of friends all gave great hugs now that I think about it).  He was getting into radio, I am not sure how that went.  Of course, there's Tim.  I met him in the 7th grade though, and he as well as Ed have been my friends for so long.  I can't imagine my life without them.  Anyway, I miss these people.  I don't talk to them very often anymore, but I do think about them oftena dn miss them a lot.  I have nothing but love and respect for these people and hope that one day our paths will all cross again.

      I had a really disturbing dream last night and well I think maybe that is why I have been kind of quiet today...well relatively speaking.  Anyway, I dreamt my dad died.  I remember feeling the grief and being just completely overcome.  I haven't heard from my dad since Mother's Day and maybe that is why it has weighed down on me.  My dad by no means is a perfect man, buthe does love us in his own way and life isn't so black and white.  I don't know.  I know he has his faults and his shortcomings, but it does not take away from the love he has always had for each of us.  I think that sometimesdwelling on the hurt blinds us to the love...but don't get me wrong I know why we hurt.  Anyway, I can't imagine my dad being gone.  I think because for most my life he has always been a very important figure in my life.  I can't imagine him gone from it, even though I see him maybe once a year the past few years.  Oh well.  I guess it is just one of those mysteries in life that I was not meant to understand.  I dont' know.  It dawned on me though that my Bailey is will 7 this year.  OMG!  Where the hell did the time go?  Nalani will be 4...what 4?  That can't be right.  lol  If you see her, you will know what I mean.  I am so old and my children are growing.  Oh do I love those monsters of mine.  I was reading a friend's blog and she reminded me of the first times I saw Bailey, Nalani and Emily.  The first peek in my tummy.  Those are etched in my mind, heart and soul.  I ahve poems on  urlLink    Search for Lanie Dikitanan and you can read them.  My favorite is the one about Bailey.  You can be the judge though.  Check them out.  Anyway, I should rest, my body is not feeling well again.

      I am still sick, and yes I am still taking my anti-biotics.  Go me, huh?  haha  Oh well, life will go on and eventually I will get better.  I hope.  I just don't know what else to do.  I do feel bad that Leila is pretty sick mostly because she doesn't have health insurance.  That really bites for her.  Healthwise my family isn't doing so well.  My sister continues to have lessions.  They are thinking of doing surgery on her.  Then my mom has new lessions in her brain and I am not happy about that one.  I don't know what that entails, but they have decided to give her a new medication.  I hope that things go well and that she gets better.  I hope that the stress of the past year hasn't taken its toll on her, although I am pretty sure it is just that.  That is maybe why I harbor ill feelings towards my cousin.  He knew my mom was sicka nd subjected her to all this.  It could have been avoided.  Thank goodness we are working with a great person.  Okay, well I have some stuff I need to clean up on my desk.  Have a great day everyone.  Maybe I will post later.  Oh and by the way, CURIE...THANKS SO MUCH for your undying support.  You are truly a friend I would hate to ever lose.  HEIDI...hang in there honey, if I can manage it, I will come and see you in Virginia.  MICA...the flowers were awesome.  I am blessed to be surrounded by some very wonderful people.

      Okay so for some reason I cannot go back to sleep, so I thought I would come on here and maybe try to put into words my frustration with my family...no not with Ed and the kids...they are the one saving factor in the whole equation.  Anyway, I won't go into people's business because that is their business.  I do however have some feelings towards the entire situation.  First of all, I know a few people with a lot of hate in their hearts.  I know a lot of people hate others because of heresy.  That to me is sad.  If you are going to dislike someone, dislike them for what you know they stand for...meaning hate someone after you have met them with no preconceptions...don't hate because others hate.  That is so high school and I have been on the receiving side of that hate and it is not a pleasant feeling.  I guess that is why I empathize.  Second of all, people make mistakes.  Don't get mad because someone you confided with confided with someone they love.  If I tell something to my friend, I won't be surprised if it is told to someone else...I mean that is the risk you take when you speak about someone.  It is just a lesson you learn.  So if you really don't want something to get back to another person, keep it to yourself or know that there is always a chance it can bite you in the butt, but most importantly know that in the end you can't shoot the messenger.  Hell, if I say something to someone, I know I should only say something I can tell that person to their face.  Lastly, carrying hate is a sad trait.  You become a very acrimonious person and well you end up pushing away the people who care about you.  I think about the distance and gaps in relationship and well it is because people are unable to accept their wrongs and move on.  Life is all about moving on and not carrying baggage with you.  It is about forgiving those who fault you, not just some people.  You cannot say you can forgive if there are people you cannot forgive.  You cannot be a whole person if you cannot accept that no one is perfect, everyone faults another person, and that hate shows ignorance, lack of compassion, and selfishness.  I am not some perfect person preaching here...these are all lessons I am learning...but I am a mother now and it is my great hope they do not live with hate.  I hope that the things I talked about above carries through to them and that they don't' learn the lessons I have learned the hard way.  It is hard to be judged on a couple of situations in your life because it is only a small fraction of who you truly are.  I have been judged so many times and many times the depth of my character is forgotten.  That is sad because people don't see how hard I strive, the amount of love I carry...WHO I AM...and it is all because people don't move forward.  Anyway, sorry for the ramble.

      Okay well I can't sleep.  I am feeling better, but still am coughing and I can't hear very well out of both ears and my throat still hurts, but hey at least my body is not producing mass amounts of yucky stuff.  I would use the correct  term, but would rather not gross anyone out too much.  THANKS MICA for the beautiful flowers.  You didn't have to, but it was a great pick me up.  Emily loves them too.   Okay better got to sleep and get this asthma test done.

      I think that the worst thing about being the eldest sister is knowing something...no wait, learning something in life and not being able to teach it to your younger siblings...you know how there are things that are better learned than taught.  Well I am experiencing that and well it sucks.  I suppose that I should just let things run its course, but our family seems to be growing distant, well one branch anyway.  I don't know how to bridge the gap without buidling another bridge.  I do know that the best thing I can teach my children is that carrying hate in their hearts will eat up at them and cause them grief.  I know this from my own experience.  I carried a lot of hate in my heart for many years and it brought me no joy and made me a resentful person.  There are people I do not like all that much, but I let go of it if someone I care about cares about them.  That is just the easiest way to go about things like that.  Being acrimonious and hateful serves no resolution to anything.  whether we want to admit it or not both stem from hurt.  After all why not hate those who hurt us?  But hating not only makes you less of the person you truly are, it blocks you from the power of forgiveness and the abilty to move forward in life...that is the lesson I at least have learned...anyway, more ramblings of a tortured soul later.

      Well to be completely honest with you, I was truly annoyed with that funky A that was always on my post.  I didn't know how to fix it.  It also made me sad too.  That layout, although very beautiful reminded me a lot about the baby we lost.  I don't know why or how to explain it, so I thought this would make me feel better.  It actually reminds me of my youth, when we used to have parties at shoreline park in Long Beach.  Remember that?  Those were the days.  Let's see, Mother's Day was simple, but I must say the gifts I got yesterday meant more to me than any material thing.  Bailey gave me a pin and project he made at school.  I loved it.  IT was so sweet.  Then he served me heart shaped waffles and scrambled eggs that he and his daddy made.  Ed was so kind and sweet to do that for me.  The days are going by quickly and I am thinking more and more about Ed having to go to Iraq....and then that around this time we should have been preparing for our baby...the ladies pregnant along with me are preparing for their children and I guess a large part of me is still mourning that.  I am sad with the weight.  I have seen pictures and I can't believe I am this BIG.  I just keep telling myself I need to do something about it and stop saying I will and not do anything...but I don't know what it is.  I think it is discouragement that after these many years I haven't been able to do anything about it...why will it change now...or maybe I just don't believe in myself.  I don't know.  I am very very discouraged by my weight...  Anyway,forgive my pessimism.  I am sick...I forgot to say that.  I have two ear infections, a sinus infection and strep.  Just thank God I am alive right?  I need to learn that change in my health and in my body image will be slow but well worth the effort.  Just pray for me that I have the courage to move forward and make a change because not only is my body not healthy at this point, my mental well being as well.  I know feeling this unhappy about me isn't good.   I don't know if I will be taking summer classes.  I don't have the money for books and things of that sort.  Oh well.  We will see.

      I am so happy and proud of myself.  I just got a phone call today saying that the scholarship that I had interviewed for has decided that I was the best candidate for the scholarship and that they were going to give me a $1,000 scholarship.  I was so elated to hear the news.  I swear I wanted to cry.  This is a big deal for me because I juggle a lot and most of my most recent accomplishments have more to do with my family than myself.  This is the most encouraging news for me.  I think it is more of a reassurance that I have really found my calling and that I truly know what I want and how to get there.  I want to thank you all for sharing in my joys.  So I did it...I got $1300 in scholarships for next semester...go me.

      So anyway, I haven't blogged in a long time.  i just thought I would let you guys know what has been going on...first off...  I got a scholarship...YAY me!  Well the one I am getting for sure is just $300, but hey, it is $300 I didn't have before.  So the school is giving the scholarship recipients a nice award ceremony and of course I want my family to be there.  I think it would mean a lot to me for them to see me get this award...maybe because it is something I did on my own...and well, I don't have a lot to brag about in my life that doesn't include my kids or my husband...so it is nice to have my own bragging rights.  Plus they are the reason I keep going along in school.  Anyway, yesterday I had an interview for another scholarship.  I don't know for how much, but it was a complete honor to just be considered for the scholarship.  I cannot tell you guys enough how good it felt.  I was actually able to tell about my dreams and my goals and why.  I have wanted to be a teacher for so long, I could almost taste it.  I fell like I am so close and so far at the same time.  I know I can be a teacher and I know it is going to be the most rewarding career Ic ould ever choose for myself.  I just need to get to that finish line.  I don't know what 4 year college to go to because I have my children to worry about and I have to do what is best for them schoolwise, so until this coming school year is over, I won't know what school best suits them.  Another thing worth bragging about is that Bailey is getting student of the month again.  I am so proud of that young man.  He is such a trooper and does a million things I don't expect him to do.  Everyday I am realizing more and more how very special this child is and can already imagine the great things he will accomplish in his life.  He has already succeeded in accomplishing more than any other person his age...but that is mommy bias talking, I suppose.  Then there is my beautiful Nalani.  The more time I spend with her, the more I realize how wonderfully challenging this little girl will be when she grows up.  She has a freedom in spirit that I wish I still had and a beautiful smile that melts away all the problems that seem to take over my life. All is right in the world when I hold her in my arms and when she runs up to me to give her special kisses to me.  Aww...and how could I forget my beautiful Emily Love.  She is a ray of sunshine.  She is getting bigger and more adorable with each passing day.  Her smile as well melts my heart.  I cannot imagine my life without my kids.  I used to want to be a teacher because I just lived kids, but I don't think I appreciated kids as much as I do now.  I now know the value of a child's presence and how each one can touch your life like no other can.  I can't wait to be surrounded by children and to be able to make a small impact in their lives.  On a sad note, my cousin Madona is moving away...just whne we started to see a lot more of each other.  I don't think that it is a bad thing.  i think it is the best for her.  She is going to be so happy with her new love and that is the best thing.  I can't imagine the incredible life that is before her and i am glad she has found someone who can love her completely and respect her equally.  I know she doesn't read this, but I wishher and Ben the best life has to offer.  I won't say anything about how messed up Leila got at Madona's going away party...I will say though that Mickey might think twice about inviting her again...haha...you gotta love Leila...just because I am not an alcoholic, doesn't mean I don't understand the "rules."  SO THERE!  Next time, listen to me when I am schooling you on alcohol.  I didn't succumb to the peer pressure...I was never one to succumb...just ask all my friends in high school and from college...I am as straight as they come.  Hey, I will drink every now and then, but why do you need alcohol to have fun?  I don't....and that's how I have always been...or maybe I am just boring, who knows...maybe both.  So anyway, that is what is going on here...Ed still doesn't know when he is shipping off...I am hoping it isnt' anytime soon.  I would love for nothing more than to have him here for Bailey's graduation.  Of course I want him here with me also.  *on a side note*  I haven't been myself lately because of worrying about Ed and well thoughts of my baby loss have plagued me lately...maybe because it is close to my previous due date...June 27th.  Aww...but the baby is in heaven with all the love of family and friends gone before.  SO yes, I do believe a baby is a person upon conception.  The baby was real and was ours.  Anyway, enough gloom, life is good and I am blessed.

      Okay, so whenever someone brings up the "extras" that the military families get, I am going to scream my head off.  Okay, take for example tonight.  Any regular job my husband wouldn't be working 15 f*%$in' hours and not get paid for the hours after 8 hours.  Not to mention the other 5 frickin' hours he will probably work when he gets home.  An what other frickin' job will send you on a frickin' business trip for 7-9 months in the frickin' desert with crazy people trying to kill you.  So when these people who think we get off by getting all ther "extras" none of those "extras" amount to the hours of dedication and loyalty that our spouses or family members devote to their job.  Shamefully there are people there who don't appreciate the hardships that WE military families face.  I am annoyed and heated with stupid comments on how cool it is that my husband gets housing allowance and cans hop tax free at the commissary and exchange...(by the way, the commissary may not tax, but there is some service charge of some sort at the end of my bill and then the tips for baggers...so how much am I really saving...probably still some, but not the outrageous amounts others may think.  Yes readers, I am PISSED OFF because our lives aren't easy.  I hate that my husband works awful hours.  I hate that he will be going to a land where there are more than a handful of people wanting to kill him and his comrades, I hate that my children will have to go without their father for 7-9 months, I hate that I will have to be the only parent for that amount of time....but I LOVE my husband and I AM VERY PROUD of his career in the Navy.  I just wish people would stop making stupid comments.  Okay, I will end at this.  Thank goodness for our trip to Legoland tomorrow...maybe my blood will stop boiling.  Oh hey, I have a new reader...Riss (a friend of an old friend from college).  WElcome to my madness Riss and thanks for the uplifting comments.  =)

      I am taking the kiddos to Legoland, it should be fun.  =)  I don't have much to blog, but "Cold Mountain" was a good movie.  I must admit that I truly enjoyed it.  It was long, but I think the story was sweet.  Okay everyone, have a good rest of the week.  I am going to enjoy Ed's time off.  He has a lot of training coming up before he deploys back to Iraq in Spetmeber.  I am going to miss him.

      Amazingly enough, we came across Ed's Senior Year yearbook...it was fun going through it.  I was reading what I wrote to him in it and it was kind of fun.  Corny, like any other teenage thing written...haha But a lot of the things we planned came true...not exactly in the order or the way we would have wanted, but maybe in a way it was better.  Take for example we planned to take many trips, such as one to Hawaii (I was supposed to go with him and some of my friends, but my parents ended up punking out on me.), then a trip to Catalina Island (have not taken that one yet either), a trip to the PI (haven't done that one either) and well the ever so corny, trip down the aisle (HA!  Did that one twice, once in Lake Tahoe, the other in an actual Church).    Okay so there's that...oh and a side note, we have yet to take a honeymoon....maybe when our children are older and we have more money to dedicate to it and splurge with.    Then according to my little dedication to him we are going to have four children...well that almost came true this year.  As you all know I have three...our fourth would have been born this month, actually around this time was my due date...well things happen for a reason and I am sure that when we are ready a beautiful little one will come along.  Sad news, I didn't get the job.  I guess that is sad news, but gives me the opportunity to still search for another job.  I am sure something will come along.  I have every faith in it.    So how is every one doing?  Here are more of my high school memories:  (As you can see, I like the memories, they make me laugh...when you are around sreaming kids all day, you tend to stick to things that humor you.)  * Driving back and forth to Vallejo and San Leandro to see Ed.  * Going out with a guy just because I didn't have a bf in high school (ended being a BIG mistake...I mean come on...when you start as a Senior you are itchin to have a bf)  * Taboo- Keiko and I had the best team...all I have to say is giraffe!  * Driving with Sheryll and my sisters to and from Great America...never danced so much while driving.  * Who could forget the big conversion van I drove to school...Can we say BIG BERTA?  Don't ask where the name came from.  * Ballejo and Nachos...gotta love Aunts..."Lan you want some nachos?"  * Sneaking out of the house...sneaking Ed into the house.  * MY PERM (when you have hair as think as mine and down to your ass...DON'T GET A PERM...well don't get one anyway!)  * Going on numerous dates does not equal dating...especially when the guy sees you as his best girl-slash-friend...oh my bad!  * Swim meets...band "geeks" a Florin High tradition.  * Stresses of yearbook...  * Going to a dance and mom forgetting to pick me up...alone in the parking lot for 2 hours is not fun.  Those are all I can remember for now...sorry if this not amusing to you guys, it is very amusing to me...LOL

      I am glad I came across old photots because now I can move forward with happiness.  It is one thing to talk about moving forward with happiness, but it is another thing to do it and actually mean it.  This time I mean it.  I was looking through the old photos and saw that I have some old school photos of John, Michelle, Airra, Patty, JoAnn, Noreen...and this is before me and JoAnn and Noreen all became friends...so I thought that was cool.  I feel good today.  I think all those flooding memories just uplifted my spirits.  Oh here was my quote for my Baccalaureate (sorry if the messed up the spelling) "You learn the hard way who your true friends are.  Don't lose them the same way.  Learn to love yourself then loving everyone will come naturally."  (Something along those lines...)  I lost my friends the hard way, but a part of me is still convinced that they arne't so much lost....and I am relearning to love myself.  It is amazing to see some of the stupidity you possessed during high school and yet the somehow there are a very eerie insightfulness to us as well.  My life is nothing like I imagined in high school...but it is sure as hell better than anything I had ever hoped for.  I guess life has a funny way of working things out.

      I don't know why I came across my old yearbooks, but I did and I came across my Freshman and Sophomore yearbooks.  Thank goodness I didn't come across the Junior and Senior year ones because then I think I may have just lost it...those were the ones I hold dear to my heart and those are the ones that made me feel closer to my friends.  So I am glad that I am not finding those yearbooks.  I realize that even though I didn't believe I had a lot of friends, I did.  I guess I didn't think of them too often because they weren't in the circle of friends that most my memories were with.  It is interesting though.  Not a lot of them were close friends, but friends nonethless.  I have noticed that my friends (not including the ones I gained as friends through my sisters) live at least 7 hours away.  My very close one is clear across the country.  The other ones are in northern Ca.  The ones in northern CA have remained in touch through the years.  We will lose touch and then by some miracle get a hold of each other again and take up where we left off.  I like that.  There is a familiarity and things aren't different with the friendship even though we are different.  Okay so here are some of my favorite memories:  * History Day...we would make it to state finals after all the drama, we came up with some good work.  * Cooking fried rice for Keiko and having too much garlic...she still ate it and said it was okay...now that's friendship.  * My parents went to IL for a week and my mom forgot to leave money adn we ran out of food.  LOL  I had to pay in quarters and nickels and dimes.  (Had to get into that sparkletts bottle)  * Driving to summer school in my dad's truck, the seats would burn our butts.  * SWIMMING LESSONS were awful because my instructors happened to be the swimmers for the high school, which I happened to manage.  * Walking in school during zero period thinking I was all cute because I had on my emerald babydoll dress only to find out later that I had walk about 20 minutes with my dress up past my ass.  * My first kiss...GROSS!  You know how everyone has the story about the guy just sticking their tongue down your throat...yeah, I have one of those.  * Junior prom...being so infatuated with my date who was so infatuated with my best friend...OUCH!  * Junior prom...first time getting really dolled out...I hated my hair!  * Junior Prom...BOWLING!  Can we say HELLA TROUBLE from my parents?!  * Senior Year (Winter homecoming) Falling in love all over again with Ed.  * Senior Ball...Being in love...  * Senior Ball...15 people in one suite...what the hell were we thinking?  * Grad Nite...beating the damn Marvel Comics game with Keiko.  High school...almost 10 years ago.  THere were some good times...I don't think we will have a ten year reunion, but it sure has been nice looking back.  I will post more if I remember more memories.

      I am saddened by the news of another captured person, especially that it is a US Marine.  I guess with Ed deploying soon, it is starting to sink in and hitting close to home.  I love Ed and again, can't imagine my life without him.  I wish he didn't have to to go Iraq, but know he has a very noble job to do.  So when I hear all these people knocking what is being done out in Iraq I am angered.  I am angered because as much as I don't want them there, they are there because they are US soldiers and doing what they are told.  We don't have to like what is going on there to support the men and women out there.  They aare the ones risking their lives, leaving their families and putting their lives in God's hands.  So all bickering aside, let's show these men and women the respect they deserve.

      I was going through some old photos recently with Nalani.  Of course it brought some tears to my eyes because there were lots of memories.  I guess you can say I am having a hard time with the latest transition in my life, leaving behond a past I held onto so dearly...but in life we have to learn to let go of things...the hate we carry with us, the love we thought was forever, the friendships that no longer remain the same...but we can hold onto the memories and the wonderful times that we have.  Those wonderful memories were all captured in those pictures.  All the love flooded back and I couldn't help but smile at the memories that bombarded me with each passing picture.  High school wasn't as bad.  I guess I carried me the last year...all the bad things that happened that I somehoe pushed back the great memories that I experienced.  For example...I had a lot of pictures of Senior Prom.  I remember the drama of getting a group of 13 people together for dinner... the nightmare of the tabs...UGH  Why is it so difficult to divide a tab?  But I saw the joy in our faces...I miss those people.  I miss the people that at one point in my life, I depended on for my own survival.  Now I look back on those pictures and realize that most of them have been out of my life for years now.  We have every intention of keeping friendships, but get so caught up in our lives.  I know that I had a difficult time fitting into my role as a wife and mommy, so I focused on that rather than my friendships.  Then before I knew it my friends and I slowly drifted into strangers and now the people who were the closest to me became the most distant.  But I hold in my heart everything each of those people meant to me, did for me, and endured for me.  As far as high school friends go, they were the cream of the crop, the most loyal and devoted friends...but as life would have it, people change and people drift and people follow different paths...maybe one day we will remeet and forge new different friendships.  I love looking at old photos because it brings back happy memories and becuase I am not FAT in them.  haha  No, but really, I love seeing the times when high school drama seemed like the world was going to end.  Boy were we dumb!  Soon after high school I got married and a had a medical crisies with my first born.  No drama came close to any of the ordeals I went through with my son.  But like with everything it is fun to visit, but to to live.  So I will close the album and take with me my fond memories and look forward to the new memoires I will make with my new friends, my family, my husband, and my children.

      I wonder why when things are over we sometimes forget the bad parts...for example...  For each childbirth and labor, I can remember feeling alot of pain, but I don't remember what the pain felt like.  I can remember thinking that I didn't want to have another child, each of the three times, but that was at the time.   I think that is what it is though.  We have some human quality that prevents us from remembering pain...whether it be child birth or perhaps relationship woes...I mean relationship in general, not just love/couple things, but every relationship.  I think that for most of us, that is how we continue to go on and live life.  Random thoughts, I know.  Oh, but on the upside...I have a wonderful family.  Thank God for that because at this age I realized that they are the ones that I can count on forever.

I am so glad my friends didn't let my stupidity throw this away.  i am glad we are still together.  The kids are good, they ahve been getting into a lot of trouble.  I feel bad for them because they ahve so many adults to answer to, as if having one set of parents aren't enough...haha  Have a nice rest of the week...Ed has Friday off...YAY!

      There is still no word on the whole new job thing.  I know that they said that it would take a couple of weeks...but geez...lol  I was hoping I did so well that I would get hired on the spot...oh well, huh?  So life goes on.  I am sitting here trying to remain calm and not be moody...although sometime that is hard for me because I am bored.  LOL  Summer, I should be in school.  I took this summer off to be back to 100% for the Fall.  I want to finish school already.  i am glad though that Leila is well on her way of getting done.  I am glad Kata is well on her way to finish as well.  We will all get there pretty close together...how funny.

      Ed came home around 1 or was it 2?  I don't know.  I know I was super tired and just wanted to sleep straight through...but of course he is my husband, so I got up and stayed with him downstairs while he ate.  We talked a little bit and I heard a little bit about what he did there.  I really do love that man and miss him when he is gone.  I guess I don't realize it until he is gone and when he gets back.  I can tellw e have grown so much and matured in our thinking because we don't fight as much...gosh hardly...when we do fight it is because I am moody and that doesn't happen too often these days.  I just don't see the point in it anymore.  Being moody just messes up the day.  I have to deal with it.  Anyway...I was upset before I went to bed, but now I am better.  I will have to concentrate on what I have now....and what I have now is awesome.  I need to remember to never look back with regret but look back and remember the good times and remember that the bad times mad you stronger.  OH OH OH  We are going to go bowling today...WOOHOO!

      I am staying up in hopes to see my honey, but I am tired and I think the battle against fatigue is losing.  I swam a mere 4 laps and AI am tired, time to build the stamina.  I am going to try and swim an extra lap a day with the hopes of building up my cardio.  I know that losing weight will be a long time battle for me, but it feel sgood to be on the road to doing something about it.  Thanks to my sister Leila, I think I can do this.  She keeps me motivated and helps when I am feeling down.  I have been depressed altely, keeping it to myself.  I feel empty, but not.  I feel broken.  I feel lost in a world full of confusion.  Show me the path to happiness, I will follow you closely...then reality sets in and I realize my own happiness depneds on me and not where others lead me to.  It is where I lead myself.  Change starts on the inside and works its way out.

      I am very concerned about the beheadings of these people in Iraq. What kind of world do we live in when this kind of action is accepted?  Despite the rationalization that these actions are done to scare countries into listening to them...but why do such barbaric acts?  Why anger the global community, why make your people look like savage beasts with no compassion...maybe that's why.  The world lacks in compassion.  I am not saying that America has a lot of it, maybe it has very little compared to other countries, but from the actions of the "terrorists" in the Middle East lately, it shows just how uncompassionate people can be, it doesn't matter what race.  Any one person that performs such horrendous acts do nothing but show their weakness in character and their lack of human compassion.  For it takes a dark soul and a person void of human decency to kill another person without regard...in a very ugly way too, through beheading.  I pray to God all this stops, but fear that the enraged "terrorists" will not stop even if foreign militaries leave the country.

      I think it is cool when old friends resurface...  Anyway, I got these cool little notes from an old friend who reminded me that focusing on what was lost leaves little or no time for you to appreciate what you have.  Yes, I am a weird person.  I admit that wholeheartedly, but there is one thing about me...I love completely, so although I may be harsh to those I love, I love them and would do anything for them.    Anyway, I am thinking of planting more things...any suggestions...I hear green beans are good...haha  I need to get some of those.  Oh and fried green tomatoes, I have to try that, a good friend tells me they are good.    Take care everyone and have a good day...I hope Ed does come home today and that things have not changed...but with the military, you never really know.

      Time to accept when there is nothing left for you to do.  I hope that with time my friendships will resurface, if not, well it was great while it lasted.  I wouldn't trade any of those memories for anything...good and even bad.  These people were such a huge factor in me and who I am today, I will not go and pretend they weren't.  A lot of what I know about being a friend was taught to me by them and a lot of the things I learned about what a friend should not be was learned through my relationship with them.  For whatever shortcomings, I am sorry.  No excuse but the fact of plain ignorance.  Health scares certainly put things in perspective, but maybe it was too late anyhow, maybe it has been too late for so many years now and I just didn't want to admit it.  But I will not regret holding on to something so precious to me, I am sorry only that it was taken for granted.  In life you win some and lose some, I was glad to ahve won the time I had with them and sad that I have lost a future with them.  Who knows with time, maybe it will heal wounds.  I hope so because they are important to my first born.  Sorry for all this.  I guess I blog this because one, I can't really let them know my intentions because they don't return calls or e-mails....and I wanted to make myself clear that I am changing my ways and that I admit how superficial and controlling I have been in the past and I regret the hurt it has caused.  Maybe it is also in hopes that one day they come across my blog and realize how much I miss them.  Either way, it is an easy to get thigns off my chest.  Onto other things...  Abigail (my cousin via Uncle Tunying) is spending 1-2 weeks with us.  It is nice to have her come over.  I remmeber wanting to be around my relatives growing up, so I am glad she has this opportunity to be around family.  Sometimes it is funny, sometimes stressful and many times hard, but well worth it.  Ed will be home in less than a day.  I can't wait.  I miss him when he is gone.  He hasn't been gone like this since Kuwait.  A HUGE part of me is going to be sad when he leaves and scared, but I have faith in his abilities and that God has a plan.  I believe that Ed will do great things in life and show everyone who ever doubted him that he is capable of being a good person and do big things.  I can see it.  I better go to bed.  I have to take my dad to his physical...well I don't HAVE to, but I want to so I can make it down to IKEA to buy the shelves Ed has wanted for awhile.  Have a good week everyone!

      Damn is it really Monday?  Anyway, it was fun going bowling.  Oh my goodness...I think that is the most fun we had as a family in a very long time.  We have to do it again with Ed.  I got to meet Tanya, Jose's sister.  She is such a sweetheart.  I am so bummed that Ed missed her.  I think he would have liked her too.  She was so sweet...Jose and her come from a reaaly good family, I can tell by them two.  So anyway, I have been trying to clean up because Ed is coming back home.  I miss him.  I worry about him too.  So Kata and I had poopie duty.  YUCK!  Gosh I don't know how many times I came close to throwing up...now I know why I don't want a dog.  haha  I will post more later....I have to get back to cleaning.  We are going to SD later (tomorrow)....so I better get some cleaning done.

Anyway...a very  HAPPY FATHER'S DAY  to all the daddies out there and the soon to be daddies as well.  Oh and again... HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESSICA!   Now let's all go and have fun!

      I am tired, but the silence is comforting and different.  With three kids  you don't get that much silence, so it is kind of nice.  I am also a scaredy cat, so of course I keep thinking I hear something when it probably is nothing.  I am kind of hungry, but won't eat because it is too dang late and I shouldn't be eating this late. I am just going to think about what to do today...hmm..bowling...it should be a lot of fun.   HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!   ALthough I don't know if any fathers are reading this, so please tell your respective fathers that I say HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!  I am glad my dad is home. I miss him.  I would work full time to just have him come home more often.  In fact that is why I got the job so we can afford for him to come home.  His pay gets docked a lot when he comes home for visits...so he doesn't come home much.  I am so going to enjoy the time he is here.

      How can I forget to say something about this.  Leila won.  AYYY!!!  Can we say  REMATCH ?!  Hell yeah, I want a rematch.  haha  That was fun.  It was cool to be playing with Kata, she isn't around as much as we would like so when she is here, it is nice.  We but heads like rams, but I have nothing but love for her.  I am glad she decided to stay up here and hang out.  It has been far too long.  I am waiting here wanting Bailey to go to bed, but he isn't going to bed.  I hope he falls asleep soon.  We will see.  I wanna play again.  I am addicted to MP5.  HAHA  Anyone with me?

      I feel semi-productive.  I can't say that I did as much as I would have liked to, but I did do more than what I usually do.  I am looking around and thinking that I should maybe clean my desk and for those of you who have seen it you will know why.  LOL  Okay so maybe I am not the most organized or neatest person.  I will admit to that.  I am however working on it...I think that the best way to describe me is that I am a work in progress.  I seem to be a really big project.  LOL  Sometimes in life all you can do is just laugh.  I am watching "Cheaters."  I haven't watch that show in a long time.  I think that it is a pretty messed up show.  I mean I wouldn't want to have the public know that my husband is cheating me.  I would like to find out on my own and probably tell a selected few.  I was once very scared of Ed cheating on me, more along the lines of paranoid.  I have learned that I have to trust him and that I cannot take everything as him cheating.  He comes home to me and he loves me.  It was a very hard thing for me to learn mostly because I was young and yes STUPID, but through it all we are here and stronger.  I think back to how damn STUPID I was and wonder why it took so long to really GROW UP.  I really am changing and the change that is happening is making me feel a lot better about myself.  I can't explain it.  Oh so anyway, my kids were great today.  Bailey drove me a little batty when he didn't do what I asked him to do.  He is also whining a lot...hell it is him and Nalani.  I guess it is just the thing for them to do.  I don't know.  Oh well.  Well I also wanted to say a Happy Birthday to Jessica.  I hope you have a great year.  I can't wait until Ed comes home.  I am actually bummed that he is missing out on Father's Day.  It is sad because the kids were looking forward to it, well mostly Bailey.  I guess we can celebrate it when he gets back home.  As long as we are together that is what counts, right?  Well for now that is all that I have left in my mind...for now.

      I popped off my nails and although it is nice when I am typing I don't hear it tapping other letters, it hurt like a witch to take them off.  UGH  The funny thing is that I took it off for bowling purposes, mainly and also because the upkeep of nails is very expensive for a broke soul like me.  I have been blogging a lot, are you guys getting bored yet?  haha  You know I was thinking the other day that my mind is like a sonstant ramble.  I have a bunch of thoughts just popping up like those annoying pop-ups, maybe that is why my blog jumps around a lot.  I don't know.  Anyway, that is all I wanted to blog about, popping off my frickin nails.  I better do well in bowling tomorrow...what do you guys think?

I wish I took a summer school class.  I lagged this year.  Oh well...maybe another year.  Wish me luck that I get the job at the Stuart Mesa day care.  I want it.

      Today is a nice chill day, the parents went to a filipino concert, my allergies are starting to act up, I can feel it in my throat and my eyes are starting to get watery.  We really need a fence because our dog Stitch is a menace to the yard, all he does is tear it up.  We finally got new pretty flowers and he is digging it all up.  DANG YOU STITCH!  Oh yeah and that is another thing,w be had to clean the garage because he tore up the garage.  That destructive puppy.    You guys wanna hear something funny...haha You guys are going to love this one.  Okay, so I got into planting things (from seeds) but my lazy butt didnt' like labeling the pots.  I just went by what I remembered.  Anyway, so I took the first two pots that grew something and planted them outside (in the front).  Well they are really starting to grow...but I couldn't figure out why the flowers weren't blossoming.   Anyway papa comes home and says, "Who's the dork who planted tomatoes in the front entry way?"  LMAO  Yup, I planted my tomatoes in front and since the tomatoes are growing from it now, papa said not to take em out.  So we are the only block with frickin' tomatoes growing in the front.  Oh and then he was also able to tell us what the other mystery plant was...eggplants....luckily those were still in the pot.  Oh but the peppers I am growing have started yielding peppers...so I am excited about that.  I don't plant much, so it is kinda neat to see my stuff growing.  haha  Too bad I can't tell what the hell I am growing though.  Okay, that's all I have for now.

      Ed has been gone.  I forgot to mention him in the other post.  He has been gone since Wednesday, not long, but long enough.  I am so used to having him home all the time, that when he is gone it feels like there is a part of me gone.  I was thinking about him, wondering how he is doing and what he is doing.  I worry about him, but I know that God would not want me to worry.  Everything is in God's hands.  I was thought that life wasn't worth living, but then with my life now I realize there is so much to live for.  I have a man whom I have loved for half my lifetime (yes there where times I didn't love him very much, but those were in moments of miscommunications and immaturity.), I have three very intelligent and beautiful children, I have a family closer to me then I could ever imagine and I have a handful of friends who love me inspite of my flaws and shortcomings.  I am so thankful to God for my blessings.  Oh and I think that I did well on my interview, so please just keep your fingers crossed for me.  I really want this job and I really think I could make this work for me.  I better get to bed, my mind seems to be going a million miles a minute...

      I cannot go to sleep.  I am too disturbed by the news lately.  I am a firm supporter of the troops there.  My prayers go out to them.  With the increased violence to Americans who are singled out and used as a means to teach Americans a lesson has really lit a fire in my soul.  I cannot begin to explain the amount of anger and resentment building in me.  I HATE these individuals.  I HATE people who fall back on their "religion" to wage war and are uncaring for the innocent people involved.  There is no country who is innocent when it comes to things of this matter...but now that this is an issue that we face I am very concerned.  I do not want my children to grow up with the knowledge of such brutality and carry this fear in their hearts.  I remember when my dad would deploy I didn't fear for his life.  I hate that in this day and age, with everything that has gone on since 9/11, we are carrying a fear, sometimes pushed behind in our minds, but nevertheless, still there.  There are much more WHAT IFS in this day and age.  what is learned by such brutality?  Maybe that humans are capable of such unspeakable evils in the name of religion.  This is a scary thought for me.  I would hate for my children to hate another person based on their religion.  I pray my children never have to witness such ugliness, even though I know it is inevitable.  GOD BLESS US ALL!

      I am thoroughly disgusted by the recent news of yet another beheading of another American.  I am so sickened to know that there are actually barbaric people there that would be willing to do such horrendous and cowardly acts.  I am so sad for the families that have to endure with the pain and the knowledge that their loved one was beheaded in a lame attempt to prove something to the world.  You sick stupid bastards...it only shows how coward and how barbaric you are.  I am so sorry if this is a rather gloomy post, but I can't help but feel so much anger towards people who think that violence is the answer.  This was a senseless killing of a man.  I ache.  I can't help but think of my husband and the danger he faces by going back to the land of chaos, aka Iraq.  People there are willing to take his life and would even go as far as making him an example for the whole world...this scares me.  This really terrifies me.  This type of news is every family's worst nightmare.    My prayers go out to these poor families.  May God be with each and every one of them as He was with those poor victims during their ordeal.

        "There is not a child or adolescent within us.  There is a child or adolescent who hs grown into us."   * We are who we are because of our life experiences intermingled with all the gifts we have been given--not in spite of them. *   I thought this was a good quote especially since I have been doing a lot of soul searching.  I don't know exactly how to explain it so I just made sure to include the quote.  It is something I will be thinking about that's for sure.  Here's another good one:    "To try to ignore or erase our past is to rob ourselves of our own hard-earned wisdom."    I thought that that quote was a pretty thought provoking quote.  I have always been the type of person to live with no regrets, but of course there were parts of my past that I would not like to remember...but as this quote reminds me, it is EVERYTHING in our past that makes us who we are today.    I like this one too!    "Sharing my tears and tenderness is a risky and courageous act of love."    I never thought of it this way.  That is why when I read it, it touched me.  LOL  (Am I in a sappy mood or what?!)  Here is a good one for me to remember...(hey I AM learning)    "We are never really asked to live anyone else's life.  All we have to do is live our own.  That is, after all, quite enough."    I honestly don't think I could have summed it up better.  Why should I meddle in other people's lives, mine is enough as it is.  Great lesson to learn.  Now we come to today's quote:    "Alone-time may frighten us.  It may seem empty, as if no one is there.  With practice we can discover that we are."     * There is no way to know ourselves unless we have alone-time. *   I wholeheartedly agree with this.  I don't get much alone-time, but is sure is comforting when I do have it.  Okay well I am done here, thought I would post some good quotes.  I figured you guys would be tired of my blogs by now.  LOL   HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!   P.S.  Yeah I know the Lakers got their butts kicked.  Pistons wanted it more.  GO PISTONS!  Job well done!

      Oh I forgot...  We went to home depot and saw a lot of the things we are going to need for the house, of course my dad was like he was in a toy store.  My dad is such a dork and if you knew him you would understand it...haha  We are going to get a gate so that Stich does not tear up the frickin' back yard.  Kawaii will be leaving us soon.  She is a great dog, very cute, but the two together is just too destructive.  Stitch happens to be Ed's dog though.  LOL  Oh well.  Then we saw the stones we need for the backyard.  I don't know if we are going to get them because it might be expensive,  but we will see.  I am not so sure.  We will see.  Oh and by the way I am watching the Iron Chef and the guy in the red definitely resembles my dad.  HOW FUNNY!  I think I am going to try and get some sleep.  Wish me luck.

      The first interview went very well.  I think I may get the job.  I should have gotten that job a long time ago....like when I still lived in Stuart Mesa.  I am an idiot sometimes.  I may put Bailey back at St. Mary's.  I just don't feel comfortable.  I don't know I and I can't explain it.  Anyway I found a very interesting quote from my sister's calendar gift to me...    "The human Heart does not stay away from that which hurt it the most. There is a return journey to anguish that few of us are released from making."  --Lilian Smith   Then it says:  * When I am ready, I will have the opportunity to make these return journeys to old hurts with the knowledge that I can heal them and move on. *  I thought this was very interesting and a very good quote for a dear friend of mine.  I hope she is reading this and taking it in.   Well what else...the parents are going out on a date.  I thought that was cool.  Ed isn't going to be home until Tuesday...so unfortunately he is going to miss Father's Day...  =*(  Poor kids, their daddy is away on training.  Anyway, I better get going.  I have to go to work and then have a final interview tomorrow at the Stuart Mesa daycare...wish me luck guys!!!

      If you had the chance to go back and change something in your life would you?  My answer would have to be no...all expereinces good and bad have built my character and torn me down, but the rebuilding of myself has made me that much stronger...  ...besides me attempting to change something would probably end up backfiring anyway with my luck.  I have not been very lucky lately...  Ed will be gone for a few days.  I will miss him.  I like having him around, it will be weird when he isn't.  I am proud of him though and know he will do wonderful things in life.  I hate work-ups....work-ups can bite me.

      I didn't write the e-mail because I figured to give it some time and to try and collect my thoughts.  I also wanted to make sure I came off right and that my true intentions are clear.  This is not something insignificant.  This actually is the biggest e-mail of my life and I want to make sure it is worded right.  I got to talk to papa about a lot of stuff, mostly military ramblings and I guess a lot of thoughts run paralell to his...but I am more open minded I think.  I met wonderful people today, people that will be embedded in my memory for years to come.  Here is a quote from the callendar my sister gave me:   "Timing is the key to life.  We cannot correct and edit a report until it is written.  When someone is having a bad day, it may not be a good time to "clear up" and issue that has been hanging around."    I don't know what is going on in the lives of my friends but I think that this quote is true and that timing is truly everything.  It is with my greatest hope that things are going well for them and that life has been kind to them.  How do you find a lost friend that does not want to be found?

      I m about to write an e-mail to two of my friends with the intentions of saving a friendship that may or may not even be there.  It is the hardest task I have had to do in a long time.    I truly want to save this frienship because they have saved me from making some very wrong decisions and I feel that I have taken them for granted.  As I am turning this new leaf in my life I first had to start with the people I care about and they are definitely up there.  I hope and pray I am able to salvage our friendship and if I am not bring it to some kind of closure.  I love them both and it is scary to think I could face a future without either one of them in my life, but maybe it is a reality that must be accepted.  I'll post more after I do the e-mail and see how it turns out.

      I was so happy and so very nervous at the luncheon mostly because I was surrounded by such well established women.  I felt like I was out of my element.  I hope to one day be associated with such a prestigious group.  I definitely thought they were all very knowledgeable and very commendable women.  I felt so honored and inspired to be in their presence.  I will post more about it because I am just so speechless right now.  I know they probably will never come across this, but I would like to acknowledge those kind and generous ladies for their scholarship.  Getting this has made a world of difference in my path to my goals and dreams.

      It FINALLY feels like home.  There is a comforting feeling when my dad is home.  I can't really explain it.  Yes he drives people crazy and yes he does say some of the dorkiest things, but he is papa.  I was thinking of how our lives would be if he weren't in it and I think a huge part of us would be missing.  It is so nice to have him back home.  I am a bit tired and have to get ready for my scholarship luncheon.  I am excited but tired.  Plus I think knowing that it is in a nice country club makes me nervous because I am just so opposite of all of that.  Call me Plain Jane.  I better get going, I am stalling and then the next thing I know I will be running late.

      YAY!  Papa is coming home!  He has been gone for a little over a year.  I am so excited because it has been far too long and the kids are going to love having him home.  Of course I will be subjected to relentless criticsm about my weight, but I know it is all in concern of my health.  I just have to keep reminding myself that, sometimes it is just too much.  Anyway, it will be so nice to be able to see him and be able to spend some time with him and to watch him with the kids.  I love when he is home, our family is complete....but there is the feeling of awkwardness too.  So anyway, if I don't blog as often it is because I am enjoying whatever time I have with my dad and hoping that this visit doesn't just fly by like most everything does.  You guys have a good weekend...I know ours will be super...  OH AND YES I AM A VERY DEVOTED LAKERS FAN!    GO LAKERS!     Let's kick some Piston butt!

      I must commend my son's teacher Miss Holeva for a wonderful job with her kindergarten class.  I am so amazed at how wonderful these children are due in a large part to her wonderful spirit and teaching.  I seriously doubt that these kids could have a more perfect teacher.  Mrs. Noonan is a godsend as well.  I am so blessed to have found that school.  I am going to miss it...if any gets rich please remember me...lol  I want to buy a house in Oceanside so that I can raise my kids there and keep them in that school.  I am seriously sad about Bailey not going to the first grade there.  I really am going to miss everyone there, it is going to be such a change.  A very dramatic change for us...for us St. Mary's was like family.  It is hard to leave family and it is equally hard to find a school that feels like family.  God bless the wonderful people there.  I hope they all continue to prosper and do wonderful things for these children.  The ceremony was so cute.  I cannot tell you all how wonderful the ceremony was and how well practiced the children were.  I was however upset by the comments made by their music teacher.  I hope that after seeing the graduation and after watching the children's faces light up that she feels differently about kindergarten graduations.  If she doesn't, I feel very sorry for her.  Afterwards we went to Denny's, Bailey's choice of course...then it was swimming and sleeping for me...  Greg and Joy came over, but I was knocked out because I had a case of food poisoning and well I had to be upstairs in the room the whole time.  Then we woke up, played games, they went swimming and then we bowled.  I want a rematch when these darn nails are off.  I seriously hurt myself.  UGH  Oh well, it was fun.  I am thinking of taking the kids to the Dr. Seuss thing in San Diego, but am unsure of the date.  Wanted everyone to go, but it doesn't look like it will happen.  Anyway, hope you guys have a nice weekend.

      Wow, a whole year done.  My son is going to be a first grader...I remember being terrified of him going to Kindergarten...okay the truth comes out, I have been afraid of him going to school period.  I guess because he would no longer be under my watchful eye, what if's scared me...but alas we found a perfect school that has showered my son with nothing but love.  I will miss St. Mary's.  I wish more than anything for my son to continue on there, but alas, the distance is too far and until Ed and I can afford to live out there again, we will be unable to go there for awhile.  I say this now, but if Bailey is the least bit unappy with his new school, you know I will pull him out and put him back into St. Mary's.  I regret pulling him out of there only because I love that school...oh well, let's get through first grade.  Well I should catch some shut eye before the big day.  I hope I don't make a fool of myself and embarrass Bailey by crying...but I am so very proud of my son and the accomplishments he has done.  It is with great pride and love that I watch him graduate from kindergarten.    GO BAILEY!!

      I am so saddened by the passing of President Ronald Reagan.  I think because of all the presidents, I respected him the most.  I am also saddened because of the love story behind it.  Seeing the images of Nancy Reagan and her children saddens me.  I guess you can say I can feel their pain because I have lost a loved one to Alzheimer's and it isn't a pleasant journey.  I also think of how I would handle being left behind by Ed.  I don't know if I could stand it.  The time he is away is already difficult, but if he were to be permanently gone, I don't know how I would go on.  I know I would because of the children, but I don't think it will go as smoothly.  I love him with all my heart and with all I am, it took a lot of battles and lot of tears, a lot of hurt feelings, a lot of joys, a lot of happiness and a lot of love and patience to get us here, but we are here.  I am so glad we never gave up.  There were many times I wante dot take the cowards way out and walk away, but Ed reminded me that we had so much to fight for and he was so very right.  Okay enough of my rambling...

      Why is it that when someone dies we are left to examine our life?  Hmm...I find myself doing that a lot when I hear of someone passing...like what if it was me who died?  So it has me thinking that I need to change a lot of things.  SOmethings I am already in the process of changing...some I have acknowledged I NEED to change and yet there are some things I am just now realizing I need to change...  NO MORE MEDDLING for me.  If someone comes to me, I will listen, but not try to fix their problems.  Problems can't be fixed by others, that is what I have learned.  (It is about gosh dang time too.)  NO MORE JUDGING, people are people, they are human and everyone has feelings and everyone has their faults and shortcomings...but it doesn't make other people better.  (This is one of those ongoing projects.)  I AM NOT PERFECT (now this is something I knew...but my actions spoke differently)...I am not better than anyone on this earth, I am me and that is all that counts.  Okay, so that was pretty darn honest.  I am making a great attempt to fix the "bad" things in my life and I feel good about the changes that are happening, you must change the ugliness inside in order to change the ugliness outside.

      I was just thinking...  Okay, so we hear from Ed's new command that they plan on shipping him out around September...and something along the lines of being gone for like a year...WHY?!  I mean seriously...a year?!    I am so mad, but it does not make sense for me to get mad or to be bitter, I know this is what my husband and I signed up for and I have to support him in the best way I know possible.  I will miss him and I will worry about him, but I know that it is all in God's hands.  Oh to be a wife...all the struggles, the sacrifices...oh what can I do...being a wife isn't hard, it is being a wife of a Navy Corpsman that is my struggle now...I know why we do it, I just wish it weren't so dangerous.  That is what Iraq is...dangerous...I know Ed is a great man and he knows his job and I am so very proud of him.  I just hope that he will be okay.  I am also thinking about Bailey, he had such a hard time with his dad being away for 4 months, but now he will be gone for a year...how do you explain that to the children?  UGH  I am just sitting here thinking of ways to break this to the kids...hopefully they change their minds and say that he will only be gone for 6 months...I can keep hoping, right?    Well I pray and hope that they don't send these guys out for a year...it isn't good for their morale and for the the well-neing of the families involved, but don't get me wrong, these families are the strongest families you will ever meet...they will not compalin, they will vent, but they will stand by their spouses and keep on going...they will hold the house together and the family together until they come back home.  Well this was just my vent...

      Well our dog Stitch got me.  I was watering my tree when he ambushed me from behond and yes, I fell hard and have some scratches and bruises to prove it.  haha  Oh that was funny.  Good thing no one saw me.  haha  Let's see...I am going to buy the new Jennifer Aniston movie, except the title has just slipped my mind. haha what is new with me?  I swear I am going senile already.  Emily is sleeping, oh thank goodness...she is so cute, so adorable, but so much trouble...she is entering her twos....haha  Nalani is doing okay today.  So what is going on with everyone?  I missed blogging when I was gone.  It is sad, but I figured this was a perfect way to keep track of what is going on everywhere....  Oh my gosh, I forgot to say something about the passing of former President Ronald Reagan.  It was sad to me because I truly respected him and he is one of the reasons I chose to be Republican.  Other than Clinton, I don't think I have listened to a better speaker in politics.  Yes, he wasn't perfect, no president ever has been, but he did so much for the global community.  I think that his passing was also a reminder to me of my grandmother's passing.  My grandmother died from complications due to Alzheimer's...she too lived a long life, but the last decade was when we lost her slowly.  I think Alzheimers is a very painful disease, it is a like dying a slow death.  You litereally watch your love one drift away into a place you no longer exist.  Memories are so very important to me and knowing that my grandmother no longer remembered the times I cherished hurt me.  I love my grandmother and know that she lives on in my heart.  I know she is watching over me and her great grandchildren.  So I will end this post with prayers for our 40th President, Ronald Reagan who passed away on June 5, 2004, for my grandmother who passed away in June of 1999...may they rest in peace.  I also pray for those afflicted with Alzheimers and their family that they are able to get through this disease with love, hope and dignity.

      Hallo everyone...  Well today I found out that my little man is going to be speaking at his graduation.  I am so very proud of him.  He has grown into this incredible human being and I am so sure he will do great things in his lifetime, he has already done so many, it is hard to see him stopping.  Then here is my oober goober husband complaining about stuff...haha I love my Edward.  I have decided in the next life I will be a psychologist...haha  I don't know why, but that is what I have decided...random thoughts...  Nalani is sleeping in her bed in our room, my dream is to have a nice job so we can buy a bigger house where my kids can each have their own room.  ED HURRY UP AND BE AN OFFICER!  haha    Well that is all this kookie girl has to say tonight.  Have a great evening.

      I must say that our trip up north was definitely a very nice trip.  I am a little bummed we didn't get to see as many of our friends as we wanted to, but seeing family is much better.  We got to see Ed's old pals from high school...Noreen and Frank...whom we haven't seen in ages...and then the next day we saw Svetlana and her husband Sydney...we also saw an old acquaintance (friend for Ed, acquaintance for me) from St. Barnabas, Shannon and her cute daughter...we saw his friend Joyce from a distance...we saw Tim from a distance too...that's a long story...all in all it was nice to run into people.  It is amazing to see Aaron all graduated, it is too bad he couldn't come down with us, Alanna too.  I realized that life up there is so different from what we left and as much as I would like to come back since everything is better, it is a place I don't want to return to to live.  I want to raise my children here and hopefully have them retain strong ties to the life we have in the bay area.  I am just glad to be around a very different environment for my kids.  Don't get me wrong, I love the bay area but first of all we couldn't afford to live out there and second of all we couldn't really raise children there...but the family we have left there all adore the children and I know they would be surronded b y a lot of great people who love them above anything.  We were also glad to be up at that time because Ed's uncle was in the ER on Saturday...when we left him, we thought he was okay...only to find out the following day that he had a minor stroke.  We saw him beofre we left to be sure he was okay...thank God we did because he ended up having to have a stent put in one of his arteries...I am sure it reassured his mom and aunties to have Ed there.    We drove back and Ed got lost, go figure, I knock out and he gets us lost...haha...then we backtrack and go to Patterson to see his cousin Rob.  He and his wife are great people...we had our differences a long time ago, but things are better and it is always nice to see our kids play together.  So we drive back home...I took the last 3.5 hours.  It was a nice and quiet drive.  I was getting tired towards the end.  After further discussion Ed and I have agreed to leave the children to Leila should anything happen to us and we aren't survived by my parents of course...initially they were to go to Keiko, but after thinking about it I knew that they would probably feel better being left to family and Leila has seen them through a lot of their growing an I know she would make the perfect "second" mommy to the kids...plus she knows me better than anyone.  I know her and kata would raise the children well.  Keiko loves the kids with all her heart, but it is such a great burden to leave to her.  I want her to enjoy her own children...and well I don't see my sisters having children...well anytime soon...I don't know.  Keiko was very kind to accept the responsibility, but it is such a great favor to ask of a friend...plus I know my kids would be more comfortable with their cooky aunties (am I?  haha yes I am)  Anyhow, I miss my two oldest friends Keiko and Tim, but it looks as though our paths have diverged...I hope that our paths one day cross again and I look forward to having a stronger and deeper friendship when the time does come.  Friendships never end, I am a great believer of that.

      Before you get upset over something someone has told you, make sure it is true,ask the person who has supposedly said it.  I have learned and am still learning just how effective this really is.  More chances than none you will see that whatever it is can somehow be resolved.  It is too sad in life when we carry disdain in our lives because if we were to die tomorrow wouldn't you like to leave with things resolved.  I know that when I die that all my past conflicts are resolved and that I am able to leave memories of love and happiness and not the ugliness that may have clouded my past.  This is a lesson still being learned and I can tell you now, it is a hard one, but it is a very rewarding task.  I have a few bridges to mend witha few people and I hope it goes well.

      Well Ed's leave is over and it is obvious because he is in bed now snoring.  I have to say I enjoyed having him home the past couple of weeks...although it zipped by so quickly.  Then my papa is coming home soon.  How cool is that?  You know what I was thinking about today?  It would have been cool id Ed took my last name...I mean, come on now, I get pregnant, gain the weight, go through hours of labor, go through breastfeeding and all the recovery of childbirth, and retain all the weight...why the hell can't we have my last name?  haha  oh well, not like i can do much at this point, but just something i thought about today.  random, i know.  oh well.

      haha  well excuse my typing it is guaranteed to be far worst than usual since I have my nails done.  Wow, I haven't had my nails done since Ed and I got married in the church...this was a nice treat.  I was watching the eighth grade families play together.  They had a parents against students game.  It was nice to see, I hope Bailey's new school is as wonderful as St. Mary's.  I am so sad to leave this school because we have been with them for so long.  =(  It is all about new beginnings though and we are just grateful to have found a new school.  Bailey is an exceptional person and I know he will adapt well and do great...it is just mommy we have to worry about...haha  Well that is all I can think of for now..no random rambling for today.  I have far too much packing and getting ready to do.  Bay Area, here we come...should be exciting because Ed's family hasn't really met Emily Love.  They are just going to love her...she is just too darn cute.  She would give people great reason to want to clone...haha  I will talk to you all later...I know you are going to miss me the 3 days I am gone...nothing to read online to put you to sleep.  haha

      So I was thinking...10 year reunion is around the corner.  I didn't think it would come around so quickly, but here it is, next year already.  Damn, where the hell did the time go?  Well so I am thinking, hmmm...will I go?  I think I will.  That is if our class has one because we all know how flakey our class was.  Hello...can we say messed up grad nite trip to Disneyland?  I can't believe I missed out on it because it was last minute.  UGH!  I was so looking forward to that too.  Oh gosh and senior ball?  Hello, dinky little nite clubs were not meant to hold senior balls.  I don't care how cheap it was.  Ed's brother had his prom at a hotel.  What is the world coming to?  Mind you, he goes to a Catholic High School...and my public school was against having it at a hotel because of the "SEX" issue.  Hello, people were going to have sex whether you have it at a hotel or not.  LOL  You don't agree?  Anyway, I want to lose some weight before going....only because high school was a hard thing for me...especially in the end when rumors of everything were floating around and people are already critical of me...well maybe well deserved because in the past few years I have been highly critical of others...but hey, I am changing...anyway, so I don't want to give people anymore ammunition to rag on me.  Ah, who the hell cares anyway, I have a great marriage (although wasn't always easy to get to its greatness, just ask Keiko)...and well I have three beautiful kids.  My likfe is pretty great...just working away at that degree.  Okay, so those were my random thoughts for the hour.  I have been blogging a lot...I must miss writing.  Oh, I can't wait until next semester, really...I can't wait.

      Well I must say that the children were acting very well today.  I also think that they are progressing well, although I think that the children still need a little more freedom in their projects.  I think that they are far more restricted than any other preschool group I have seen.  I think that for the most part the reason is because it is a home daycare and maybe Nicole just doesn't want her house messed up or too messy.  I don't know exactly what it is.  I guess it is just one of those things you just take in stride.  My sister lost her job, which kind of sucks because no one is in the position to help her out.  I hope that her temp agency is able to find her a decent job.  I know she has all that stuff she needs to pay for.  Losing a job sucks, especially when you really need it.  You know what I mean?  Oh well.  Bailey's appointment went okay, they say that it is just eczema and that it will take awhile for the color of his skin to be uniform again.  I feel bad for him, but I am pretty sure things will work out.  I have faith in most of the military docs we have had to see.  Anyway, I still have to schedule his routine cardiology appointment.  I hope things go well for him.  I have every confidence that everything will turn out okay.  Nalani is still being Nalani, trying to get into everything and touching everything she isn't supposed to.  Emily is okay, kind of moody because she didn't get to nap as much as she wanted to.  I had to ring the doorbell because I don't have a key to the house.  So she woke up and now is cranky and tired.  My mom is stressed because of the finances, but I think after we get everything settled and refinance the house, everything should be better here.  Leila made a comment...I wanted to add that I completely understand that they need their own lives, hello Leila is 24 (even though secretly she thinks she is 23) and Kathleen is 22.  It is just weird when they are not around.  HAHA  You would think I would feel more relieved...but I do miss their company, maybe I miss having random conversations.  I don't know...who really knows.  I am happy though when they are having a good time and taking a break.  Leila has worked her butt of in school and boy is she in need of a break.  Kathleen handles her stuff good with a job and school.  Then there is little ol' me...a semi-job, maybe full time...okay who am I kidding, I HAVE to be full time to keep my scholarships.  Oh the joy.  I hope to be finished soon.  We will see.  Well anyway, I have to try and organize my desk.  It is so messy and it is really starting to affect my mood...lol  Have a nice day, for those of you in CA, enjoy the sun...just don't get too much.

      Well I have to go and give Ed a massage in a little bit because his back hurts.  Poor guy tomorrow he has to change the oil in three cars, our van, our civic and then my sister's eclipse...she has been kind enought o let us us while she is on break.  Thanks Leila...we are so saving in gas and both Ed and Bailey are comfortable during their drive back home.  It is weird when both my sisters aren't home.  I am so used to having at least one of them here...adn by extension their significant others.  So when they aren't here, it seems odd...but it is also nice too.  The kids can be kids without me feeling like they are annoying people...at least they annoy me and Ed and well, we are their parents.  Anwyay so I was thinking today how horrible it feels when people don't return your phone calls.  I am going to try and return my phone calls.  I am so bad at that, but when you are on the other end, it sure as heck doesn't feel good.  So if I have ever forgotten to return a call.  I am so very sorry.  Bailey FINALLY has an appointment with the dermatologist tomorrow.  I am so glad, it has taken forever.  I hope they are going to be able to do something for him because I would hate for him to have a skin problem on top of his heart problem.  I don't want him growing up with a complex...but then again Bailey is a pretty level-headed kid.  Nalani was super cute today.  She went with me and Ed to get Bailey.  She loves when she can spend time with us, just her.  I don't blame her, it is hard to share parental attention.  Anyway, she so wants to go to Disneyland and I know it is going to take me forever to save the money I earn from my job, but I will try and save it to take the kids over to Disneyland.  Nalani has been dying to see the Snow White show there...since February...aww...poor Nalani.  Emily was funny today.  She is funny every day, but today we got to really watch it.  It was fun.  First I don't know what the hell she was doing to Ed's back, but it was funny....let's just say she was pulling a  Stitch or more recently, a Kawaii.  It was hilarious.  You had to be there.  Oh and then she kept making Nalani cry.  Funny how little children can press their older siblings buttons.  I know this because my sisters still to this day do that to me.  Well I will end my day's post.  A few thoughts...LAKERS vs PISTONS...it will be a very interesting in the Sticky Good Trip home.  We are trying to get back home before the game, so we have to elave the bay area around 8 or 9 in the morning.  All I have to say is All-Star team.  LOL  I love you Ed...but it is all about the LAKERS!

      Oh I was thinking...Ed is going to have to go back to work.  I am a little bummed because I love having him home.  I guess it is a luxury us military families don't get much of.  I hope they give him time off for Bailey's graduation.  I know it would mean the world to Bailey.  My dad unfortunately will not be able to make it to Bailey's graduation...he flies into LAX on the 14th.  I am sad because I know how excited he would have been to have papa there.  Wow, pa is going to be home soon.  We haven't seen papa in a year now.  It has been far too long.  I miss papa.  I mean he is the most critical person in my life, but I know it is for my benefit and he doesn't do it for the mere pleasure...okay, well maybe a little..papa likes to piss me off...he loves pissing all of us off...except maybe my mom because my mom is just the type of person you don't want to piss off...as most of you already know from first hand experience.  I am so blessed with my family.  I am seriously very very lucky to have them in my life.  No matter what choices I have made in my life, whether they fully comprehended them or supported them, they always stuck by me and made it clear to me their thoughts, but supported me even though I didn't take their advice.  I am a stronger person because of them.  I cannot imagine my life without them.  My parents have always believed in me and defended me to my harshest critics.  They also remind me of the things that may slip my mind.  My sisters are always there to support me and my family.  They love the kids as their own...I knwo that the kids drive them nutty a lot of the times, but I know that if anything happened to me and Ed, they would take good care of them.  I know that this all sounds so sappy, but I was th inking that in a few days is my parent's 28th anniversary.  28 years.  I can't imagine.  The best part is they built this beautiful family that despite our fair share of hardships and obstacles has remained stronger and more loving.  I can only hope that one day my family will be as strong as the one my parents made.  I hope I am able to instill in my children what they instilled in me, the importance of family, love and support.  If I can instill this in my children, then I know my children will be better people.  Well I have been pretty chatty today.  So I will end this here.  Take care everyone and until tomorrow...or maybe later.  I am going to go play with Ed and the kids outside.

      I must say that this long weekend was very nice.  On Saturday we had a nice lunch with my sister Kata and her friends.  It was nice to see everyone.  We then went to 32nd Street and bought her tickets for Magic Mountain since Mica's car can't get on base....hello, Mica, have your parents put a sticker on it...DUH!  (just kidding Mica).  We then went to mica's pad and it was so nice seeingher parents.  They LOVED the kids.  I like going there because they treat us like family. Then we had a very nice time just hanging out at her place.  She has a very nice place.  I liked the carpet.  I want carpet like that, I have already decided.  Ed helped her with her car.  She has bad luck, I know this because it isnt' anything new with us.  When cars have problems, they usualy coem in pairs, triplets, so on and so forth...haha  So anyway, he changed her oil and told her she has a screw in her tire.  Oh, we love getting bolts in ours...don't ask.  So after all that, we went to Goonie Central.  It was so nice to see everyone again.  Mica has a great set of base friends.  I mean these are the friends you grew up with.  It is always cool seeing them together.  I can't imagine being that close with your childhood friends continuously.  We have close family friends...aka our Carson cousins, but there was a BIG gap in the interaction department...but we are fixing that and trying to see each other more.  I am glad because they have always treated us as family, even though our last names weren't FONTELA.  LOL  I remember having such a complex when I realized I wasn't a Fontela.  Anyway, back to the luau at Goonie Central.  They had a nice turn out and everyone was so laid back and it felt like we were part of the group.  That was nice especially since Leila and Mica aren't together anymore...it was nice that everyone was still cool about everything...you know?  So I saw Cece and said hi when I saw her.  Bur I figured to make an example of myself...I am always telling Kata not to carry hate in her heart, so I said bye and hugged Cece before we left...because you know what, what's done is done and I didn't have any hate towards her.  Oh and Laura hugged us and said hello...that was new.  I am glad though.  She is a good person and has to have a big heart to put up with my sister.  haha  Anyway, on Sunday we were supposed to have Kathleen's surprise birthday, but ended up just having a few friends over.  It was nice. I got to meet Ed's friend from when he was in Kuwait.  He was so nice and so was his wife.  I liked them.  They are the type of people you feel great knowing.  They were so nice and outwardly and genuinely so.  Then Uncle Mike came.  It is always nice to have him there.  He is such a special person in our family.  It would not be right if he wasn't here.  Then Ed's dad surprised us with a visit.  It was very nice to have him out here too.  Mary and Stuart came too.  That was fun, we played the DVD trivial pursuit.  That was fun adn Mary finally took Ed down.  HAHA  (We had to let Mary win, she might throw a fit...haha  Mary, if you are reading this, I was just kidding.)    My mom and I want to give Mary a bridal shower here...a fun one where she will get some fun stuff...how much fun stuff will a bunch of mormon ladies give her?  (okay that was an inside joke).  I think it would be fun too...and Mary is truly a part of our family, just like any of our close friends.  I a happy for her and wish her nothing but the best.  Stuart is also a nice guy and has been great to everyone in our family.  Monday was a day of relaxing and recovering for us.  We napped and napped.  LOL  My allergies have been acting up again.  Go figure.  I just hope to not have this problem forever.  I mean seriously, this is really driving me nuts.  I am looking forward to our trip up to the bay.  I am hoping to cross paths with some old friends.  That would be nice.  We will see what happens.  I am also amazed that Ed's brother Aaron will be graduating from high school.  Where did the time go?  I remember when he was in kinder...lol  Aww...time goes by so quickly.  This time of his life is exactly when Ed and I renewed our love for each other. It was an exciting time for us.  I just hope that he and his love take things slowly and enjoy everything youth has to offer.   Don't get me wrong, I don't regret my life. I love it, but it isn't easy and well, take a lot of energy, patience and growing together.  But everything has turned out for the best.  School is a struggle and financially it is tough, but we have a lot more love and joy than any monetary problem or school headache can deter.  You guys have a great week.

      Well I am sure my sisters are drunk off their butts.  Today was PRIDE in San Diego.  I know my sisters and when it is drinking time, it is drinking time.  It is the one thing I didn't get from the Buenviajes, the want to drink.  There are few times I don't mind drinking but let's just say they are very rare times.  So we have a month left before Ed leaves.  I think it is starting to sink in with Ed and with all of us.  I think it sunk in with me a long time ago.  I just hope that Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery.  WE have been keeping an eye on his swelling and there definitely is quite a bit of swelling.  I know that God will keep his safe.  I just hate that he has to go through some kind of surgery, especially with the risks involved with his condition.  I guess a parent will never stop worrying.  Well I better get going.  I like to spend time with Ed before he falls asleep.  We see very little of each other during the week and when we do we are both trying to balance our sanity with three yelling kids and fatigue.  I hope you guys are having a great weekend.

      Well we just got home from the doctor's and the news isn't that great.  What was supposed to be a routine check up turned out to be something different.  Bailey's doctor noticed that he had some swelling in the scrotum area and says that it is highly probable that he will need surgery.  My head is punding from the latest news.  You all know how worried I get when Bailey has to go under.  I just hope everything will be okay.  Please keep him in your prayers.  I will be letting you guys know anything else as soon as the doctors tell me what the plan is.  Monday I have to contact Dr. Fleenor, his cardiologist, to let him know about what they found and if it is safe for Bailey to have the procedure done.  Just what the poor guy needs right before going to a new school.

      Have you ever thought about karma?  I think karma's a bitch.  So everyone be careful of what you say or do.   An example of this is the whole shady transaction made when we bought this house.  The person is now having to pay for his shadiness (for lack a non-vulgar word).  That is why I TRY to think before I spew my mouth off or do drastic things.  Is it wrong to believe in karma?  LOL  So anyway after further thought I feel sorry for people who go through bad karma.  Life is not pleasant for them.  My poor (quite literally by the way...you know I love ya Leila) sister got news from the school.  It seems she has reached the limit on units attempted.  I still think she should appeal because dammit, 30 units in Chinese...that isn't her fault.  LOL  I think she might be bale to pull it off especially since she only really needs one more semester.   I on the other hand may need a year to finish everything at the GE level.  All because my other school said I was ready when I wans't.  So I have all these other courses to take care of.  THANKS!  Thus is my life, school and school.  I have to go to bed now.  Gotta wake up early to take the kiddos to a WIC appointment (the milk, eggs and cheese help a lot) and then to a doctor's appointment so they are ready to go for school.  WISH US LUCK!  UGH

      I have been feeling like crap.  A few months ago I had a problem that lasted a couple of months.  I had severe migraines that caused me to experience vertigo.  OH I HATE IT!  Well so anyway, that has been my problem today.  I can't even begin to tell you guys how worried I am.  I hope they don't make me do another MRI because that thing SUCKS!  Seriously, I hope this gets resolved before school starts because I can't afford another set back.  Oh and then there's my books.  I looked them up and it is going to cost me between $460 and $600 for my books.  There's a range because I don't know how many used books they will have.  UGH  Shoot me already.    Maybe all this is happening because I have been really stressed with Ed leaving and haven't been sleeping well.  I use whatever time I have to do heart walk stuff because it takes me away from thinking about Ed leaving soon and well it does good for my son.  Bailey is so excited and I am excited that he is so determined and helping me a lot more this year.  It is amazing.  Maybe I should get back into scrapbooking, but then again, I don't have a lot of money to do that, but I do have quite a few things to use.  I don't know.  I have to do something though.  So yeah I warn you, you guys may not want to read for the next year or so because you might be reading my thoughts of Ed, redundant as they may be.  I think it is going to be the only way I will be able to cope with his 7-9 month absence.

      I haven't been in the mood to post lately because it has been so damn hot and my temper hasn't been very good lately and well I have been battling migraines.  I stopped taking my meds because I thought I was too young to be taking so many medications, so as soon as I stopped having frequent migraines, I stopped, cold turkey.  Now I am getting these horrible migraines and I have just been so irritable.  So anyway, we went to the American Heart Walk Team Captain dinner.  It was fun and so nice to meet everyone there.  I thought eveyone was very kind and well they have become like extended family. I haven't met a group of people more dedicated to the cause.  They have asked that Bailey and I participate in a rally at Zimmer Dental.  We are supposed to be a mission moment speaker, so basically I would have to do another speech to try and get more people involved with the cause.  I would have to talk about Bailey's condition and why we do the walk.  I really do not mind.  I hate public speaking, but this is for a very worthy cause.  I would do everything for my son, even solicit help from strangers.  I see what this money can do for the families affected by heart disease.  I feel their pain and their joy.  So if you guys don't mind sharing the link and asking a few of your own friends and family, that would be great.  It would mean the world to me.  I hope all of you are having a great week.  Hey we are almost half way done.  WOOHOO!

      Well we didn't do much this weekend, but plan for a fence.  We want to make sure to get one up before Ed leaves.  That wasn't fun, we stood around Home Depot for a few hours.  UGH  I swear we never find anyone who works in "that department."  LMAO  Never fails.  Well I better get to bed.  We have to wake up early and take care of the kids' birth certificates.  OH FUN!  I hope you all had a great weekend.

      My poor Ed.  He was so tired when he got home, he literally just passed out.  I felt so bad for him.  He didn't get off of work until 10:45, he was planning on sleeping over at a friend's house.  He called to say goodnite to the kids and Nalani asked him to come home.  So he rested a little and then took off and came home around 12:45A.  Only to have to wake up at 7 and drive back to work.  These are the days I wish the military would pay over time.  Poor guy.   When things are like this I feel bad for him.  I really do.  I can see him getting worn out.  That is when his temper flares.  He is just a tired man.  I know that he is also feeling the anxiety of leaving.  I feel ad for him for having to leave the kids at such a young age.  Emily is the age Bailey was when he left for his first deployment, so he misses this stage with Emily...and well he missed Emily's birth.  You can bitch all you want but the bottom line is this is his career and well we are almost half way done.  It would be stupid to throw it all away after sacrificing this much already, you know?  Well I have been hit with anxiety lately.  I know because I haven't been able to sleep until 3 or 4 in the morning.  I need to get more sleep because the school year is almost starting for me.  I don't know....maybe when school does start things will go back to being semi-normal.  I got an e-mail from and old high school friend, Josh.  It was so nice to hear from him.  I think that there is always going to be a part of me that will remember how much my friends got me through.  I didn't have the greatest childhood and it wasn't in no way because of something my parents did, maybe more along the lines of what they didn't do, but they loved us.  Sometimes bad things happen to good people.  Anyway, I don't want to relive that part of my life.  I don't want to be a bitter person again.  I left that behind and it should stay there.  I am just grateful to the wonderful people who got me through the darkness.  I might not be here today.

      That is actually a title of one of my poems.  So what are you guys doing?  A Belated Happy Birthday to Angelina and Faith, the twins of a recently new found friend, Riss.  I gotta hand it to her, she is doing wonderfully with her twins...well from the looks of it, they look like very happy little girls.  That is usually a good indication of good parenting.  =)  Oh I have a dilemna.  We don't know where to keep Stitch.  Like which part of the yard because he is pooping everywhere.  UGH  Well his playmate will be leaving us soon, but he is just into everything.  It is so annoying, but Ed and the kids love him so we can't exactly get rid of him.  Anyway, I should get to bed, I have so many things to take care of tomorrow and I don't want to lag as usual.  Goodnite!

      You ever think about you relief and then think back about 10 years ago.  I have a few times and it amazes me how different my life ended up being.  Here's what I had planned around this time 10 years ago:  -  I was going to UC Davis and graduate there after of course rooming with my best   friend Keiko...Obviously that didn't pan out...I ended up at UC Santa Cruz...And Keiko and I never ended living together...But she slept in the same bed with Ed and I on our wedding day, does that count?  (LMAO  Long story, that is what happens when you marry at 19 and everyone and their momma sleeps in your room...Was funny though)  -  I was going to be a BIO major.  LMAO  Yeah right, I should have added being the future President on that list...I might have had more chances with being a President than a BIO Major...I am Education major now.  -  I was going to travel before settling down.  My ass hasn't even been to Hawaii yet.  -  I would have a big wedding and magical honeymoon.  (Well big wedding came five years later and no honeymoon yet...But we have forever, right?)...oh and I also told myself I w*wouldn't get married until I was done with college...So I was aiming for 23, 24...So I jumped the gun a bit.  -  I would have 3 kids by the time I was 30...(okay I think this is the only thing I accomplished...I had 3 kids by 25...haha  five years ahead on that one.)  All in all I figure my life is just as it should be.  I can't do anything to make it any better.  I am so blessed to have this family and to know this amount of love at such a young age.  I can only hope and pray it lasts forever.  Okay, enough procrastinating.  I have some cleaning to do.

      I cannot sleep.  Well I was thinking  about my first time at UC Santa Cruz.  Okay I was thinking about my entire time there.  Don't worry, I wasn't there for very long.  I did however enjoy the little time I spent there.  What came to mind was my roommate Rahnel.  I remember when I first met her I thought she Looked" like a snob, but she was such a nice roommate.  I made a life long friend and even though we rarely talk, when we do it isn't awkward.  I have a lot of kooky memories, like our first time clubbing.  HAHA  I remember getting ready.  Oh gosh.  So here are some college memories:  - Trisha and Kelly's room smelling funky all the time and it was Kelly's fault.  - Rahnel and her beef sticks.  _ Convincing Rahnel and Trisha to join a sorority and then not getting invited to one (but hey they did).  - The hike up the damn stairs everyday, several times a day...not only in the college where my dorm was but through the entire school.  - Mountain Lion Habitat, WTH?  - Oh the food...HORRIBLE!  - The multi-colored hairstyles.  - Beautiful views and campus.  - Our frickin' room was so damn hot!  - The bathrooms that weren't supposed to be co-ed, but ended up being that.  Oh that was so long ago.  My time there was nice, I wish I had fit in better so then maybe I would have finished college.  I do miss the campus, maybe one day we will go and visit it and I can show the kids the college I first went to.  Okay, getting tired now.  Goodnite.

      Well I have to go to the dentist.  I HATE GOING TO THE DENTIST!  Only because I have the same speech, "You know you need braces." and then they hit me with a PHAT bill.  UGH  But I want to be a better example to my kids and just this over and done with.  LOL  I figure if they see that I am not scared then maybe they won't be so scared.  So how are you all doing? (all three of you)  haha  Well I hope everyone is having a good summer.  I know ours has been nice.  I have a lot of stuff to do before I go back to school...and I think I have a WIC appointment tomorrow...oh crap, what time is that?  UGH  Organization, organization, organization...you would think if I said it enough times it would work, right?

      Okay my lazy ass needs to utilize the spell check button because my ass has a hard time typing....Obviously.  It doesn't help that I am constantly being tapped on the arm by my son.  AAHHH!!!  Okay so I am on here because it is gosh dang hot up here I decided to give the AC a break because I don't want it to hurt our wallets in the end, but damn when it gets hot here, it gets hot here and let me tell yah, my frickin' migraine comes with avengence.  can you tell the heat is getting to me?  So we went to the Gap and bought some things.  I bought a couple of shirts because the 4 shirts that I have been routinely rotated are getting worn out and with good reason, I seem to only buy clothes when they are no longer appropriate to wear due to stains or holes. (Well out in public anyway) or if I outgrow them.  So life is good.  I need to do some yard work that I am putting off because it is too dang hot when I wake up.  Yeah, I know I am lazy.  I have to enjoy the little sleep in time I have left.  You know.  So you guys have a pleasant night.  I am going to jump into the shower and stay under the cold water for a good hour or two, until I am frozen...I figure it will take about 10 minutes flat to defrost me in my room...It is that hot.

      I had a good converstaion with my sister.  We won't agree on some things, but at least we can talk about things as adults.  I do however see her point.    I am tired and trying to get my bills and things of that sort straightened out.  Gosh, it is starting to get more tedious than anything else.  I don't know.  Well anyhow, I better get going for now.  I have to finish a few things around here before I am free to go about my business.  Take care and hope your week is going well.  Oh Curie just got back from NYC.  I am so jealous.  I want to make a trip up that way when I can.  I want to go and visit Heidi and her family.  I think it would be a good way to get away froma ll the stress that will come as soon as Ed leaves.  Ed will be leaving in about a month.  I don't know if I am ready for this.

      Well the migraine is gone for now.  I am getting ready to go to bed.  I hope to be able to fall asleep quickly.  Ed is already knocked out.  I hope everyone had a nice weekend.  It was nice being around the fmaily.  I think it was restful in between Nalani and Bailey's fights.  I am pretty sure my sisters had a great time at the wedding.  I am sure theya re going to have some cool stories.  I am glad that they still have friends up there...it is nice to see that most of their circle have either kept in touch or are still pretty close even if they don't talk as much.  They are lucky.  My friends and I are far too different these days and it is sad, but I think the healthiest.  Never hold onto something that isn't there.  One day we will fall back on our roots and I am sure that we will pick things up.  Sometimes friendships are like that...or so I am told.  Goodnite loyal readers.

      Well ater further thought we didn't go to Bestbuy.  I guess we are trying to save money.  It is hard on a single income...especially when the pay isn't that great...but we make ends meet.  I hope to get a job after everything settles down with school.  I actually cooked today.  It wasn't anything great, just sinigang and adobo ribs.  I figured to have some kind of variety especially since the sisters are going to be coming home tonight.  Last night we went to see a concert....it was Dolphy and his wife Zsa-Zsa.  (Filipino comedian and singer)  Anyway, I didn't think I would enjoy it, but I did.  It was fun.  Dolphy still got it, even though he is like 75 years old...I haven't laughed that much in a long time.  But let me complain for a little bit.  Okay tell me why these people were dressed for a ball...not all mind you, but most.  Hello, concert in the middle of the ghetto does not require gowns.  LOL  I am sorry, just ridiculous to me.  Oh and then let me complain about the frickin' heat in the place.  Oh it was awful, no kind of air conditioning...it was so damn hot in there.  I did like Zsa-Zsa's voice.  The girl has lost a lot of weight, she is beautiful.  I wasn't diggin' her opening outfit...too hoochified for her age.  That's just my opinion though...I could be wrong...but the lady can sing.  Okay, I think that is it...well until maybe later tonight or maybe tomorrow morning.  Hope you all had a good weekend.  I know I did.

      My migraines have been coming back lately.  I think that with the heat and the constant yammering and yelling of my kids have gotten me.  I don't know what it is with my two older ones, but they insist on fighting 24/7.  I am so serious.  My head is killing me today.  UGH.  Anyway, enough of me complaining.  For those of you who read this, I am quite sure you got e-mails for the heart walk.  Again, I understand better than anyone if things are tight and you can't make a donation, but if you could pass the word along, that would be wonderful.  I better get going, Ed has to go to Best Buy.  Should be interesting...if nothing else.

      I thought it was very important that I take the time to direct you to not my heartwalk page because I really wanted to focus on Bailey.&nbsp; This year I am making Bailey my co-team captain so that he get more involved with the cause.&nbsp; He has been very involved in the past in making some suggestions and also writing the letters that we send out, but he is older now and knows a great deal about his condition and I want him to be able to voice out with pride why we do this as a family.  &nbsp;  I would appreciate very much if you share this link with friends and family and that you all get involved with us because it certainly means a lot especially after finding out that he may soon need a pacemaker.&nbsp; I want to be more active because this is my son I am talking about and he means a great dela to me, so if I have to go out there and tell everyone I know and then some, I don't care.&nbsp; People can get annoyed all they want, but if they have seen their child through the amount of hardships I watched Bailey go through, they would be doing the same.&nbsp; I firmly believe that each one of us can make a difference by not only donating money, but donating our time and efforts to such worthy causes.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am just happy to know that I am teaching the value of this to my son while he is young.&nbsp; I am proud to have gotten him involved so early and at a young age because he will grow up being more active in his health, not only through education, but through participation.  &nbsp;   urlLink Bailey's Heartwalk Page   &nbsp;  For those of you able to donate, THANK YOU!&nbsp; For those of you just able to pass it along.&nbsp; THANK YOU!&nbsp; For those who have always been behind us, praying with us...THANK YOU!&nbsp; I am so blessed with such a wonderful support group.   &nbsp;

       Well I woke up and am feeling good.&nbsp; I know,&nbsp;I wake up pretty late, but in my defense I go to bed pretty late and well, I am not a morning person, but that is all going to change when I have to take the kids to school.&nbsp; Nalani will be going to school soon.&nbsp; FULL DAYS!&nbsp; Only a couple of days, Tuesday and Thursdays, but hey, it is something.    &nbsp;  I have been addicted to this whole blogging thing the past few days.&nbsp; I think it is because I can actually get my feelings out for the most part.&nbsp; There are still things I can't get into here only because it would feel weird putting it on here.    &nbsp;  Ed and I are looking forward to his brother and sister coming out here.&nbsp; I can't wait.&nbsp; I love those two.&nbsp; I am not as close to them as Ed is to my sisters, but not by choice.&nbsp; They are just a lot younger and well I don't get to see them all that often.&nbsp; I do hope though that I get to know them better and that we become closer.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  So anyway, I have been thinking of what to do with my room. I am thinking of painting it another clolor.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; We have dark blue carpet right now, what do you think will go with it?&nbsp; Hmm...Decisions, decisions...    &nbsp;  My dad called to let us know he is stranded in Brisbane.&nbsp; The bad weather in New Zealand caused a delay and he was alte to catch his second flight into Darwin.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; He said, "Tell Nalani and Bailey I said thanks for making me stranded."&nbsp; Bailey and Nalani were chanting, "Let's make papa late."&nbsp; Of course this was after asking me what would happen if papa were late for his plane....of course they only asked that because my dad was stressing out big time about missing his plane...anyway, as I was saying, after they asked me the consequence of being late I told them that he would have to stay here.&nbsp; So they thought it was a good idea to just let papa miss his plane.&nbsp; They were a little off, wrong plane, but hey, same sentiment.&nbsp; HAHA&nbsp; I can't wait to talk to my dad about it.    &nbsp;  Have to go back to Camp Pendleton today and finish my mom's shopping.&nbsp; I am pretty much done.&nbsp; I want to pay some things off before spending again.&nbsp; Should be fun.&nbsp; I am pretty excited...grocery!&nbsp; Yippee, Ed is baking a chocolate cake tonight.&nbsp; YUMMY!    &nbsp;  Have a great Friday and weekend.  &nbsp; &nbsp;

       It is because of stupid news flashes like this that I cannot sleep.&nbsp; I know you guys are so tired of my whining about things, but I am seriously just scared about Ed going out there, especially where he is going to be.&nbsp; That truly scares me.&nbsp; Sleeper cells, huh?&nbsp; I just hope that Ed stays out of harms way.&nbsp; Damn, and I thought that by marrying a sailor he would just be on a boat....I guess being a corpsman changes everything.&nbsp; I wish so much he were on a boat instead of going out with the Marines...but I have so much more respect for corpsmans attached with the marines because by all means they are just as much marines...they have to train and work as hard as any other marine.   &nbsp;   urlLink Sleeper cells   &nbsp;  Anyway, I should slow down on reading any news on Iraq.&nbsp; I know that it is just going to bring up my anxiety level.&nbsp; We all know that only the bad things get covered out there and I really need to stay away from all the bad stuff.&nbsp; A lot of Ed's close friends are getting shipped out there.&nbsp; I am just glad I will have other people to talk to who are in the same boat.&nbsp; I thought last year would be the end of all this worrying.&nbsp; I guess I was wrong.&nbsp; Oh well.

      Yes I am.  I can't sleep and my eyes have decided that they wanted to be a waterfall today.  My mind is racing.  This is one of those days you wish you had a girlfriend to call up and just bawl on the phone. AH!!  I guess I was thinking of the child who died.  He was born around the same time as Bailey, had his surgeries around the same time and we saw them every now and then during certain hospital visits.  He had a very similar condition as Bailey.  He passed away in school before his mom could get there.  MY WORST NIGHTMARE!  So of course in typical mommy fashion, I imagined my life without Bailey and now I am just crying and crying and then missing my dad.  OH THE HORROR!  I cannot imagine my life without Bailey...everything I am and everything I know is because he came into my life and blessed me with a love I cannot explain.  The mere thought scares the shit out of me.  Gosh you w*ould think I was psycho right now.  Loss...I hate thinking about loss...because the baby came to mind.  The baby number four that this bllog was initially dedicated to.    Snap out of it...God brought Bailey here for a reason, there is a reason why he has constantly defied the odds.  Sorry guys, a short loss of composure on my part.  I feel better.  I guess I just had to write it out since I don't have someone to call.  Thanks everyone for the kind comments lately.  They have been such an uplifting addition to my days.

      It is so weird.  You would think we would be used to him being gone....afterall he is gone for a year and then comes home for a month.  That is how often we see our dad...but we aren't used to it, not really...because if we were then it wouldn't hurt so much when he leaves.  I love my dad and miss him terribly.  I think this was hard because I saw him with the kids and he was the papa we grew up with and love, not the one from a couple years back.  He was focused on us and did things with us.  It is a really long story and quite too personal to go into...yes, there are some things I will not rant about.  I just had a very good time with my dad and I remember now why he is such an integral part of our family.  No one can piss us off or make us laugh quite like he can and he sure does bring new meaning to generosity.  The papa I love came back home and stayed for a month, the stranger and it was good.  I have to go to bed now because my butt is going to drive an hour away to catch a big tent sale on base (Ha, you know it is one of my perks in the military life.)

      My dad left today and I am feeling down, it felt like he just got here.  It is nice having him around and our family feeling complete...we aren't complete very often.   I will post later when I am not so blue.

      Well we went to Bailey's annual cardiac appointment.  I was very impressed with his new doctor.  I was a little bit skeptical about him having a new doctor only because he has only seen two cardiologists in his lifetime.  So this is his third and from the sound of it, he won't be around too long.  =(  Go figure.  Bailey is doing well, he is a whopping 4'4" and 70.5 pounds.  DAMN!  Not bad for a six year old.  Yes you guys read that right he is still six, won't be seven until November.  He is a GIANT!  Now I was a little concerned because I was told that it looks as though he may need a pacemaker and of course we are unsure of when exactly, it is all going to have to be based on his heart and how everything goes.  That is the bottom line.  I guess I see Bailey and just assume that everything is all well...but he still has some problems and some serious issues.   It sucks, but there are still some serious things that need to be considered...like his ventricle is is doing some serious work, since he only has one.  Well it seems as though with him being as big as he is, the chances of it failing are higher...buthe could just prove them wrong again.  He has so many times in the past.  Well I better go, have to run and get some chicken.

      I must admit that everytime I get done talking to Heidi my spirits are uplifted.  I don't know how she does it, but she is able to take my mind off of the petty things I carry and reminds me exactly of what a good friend does and that is bring laughter back.  We have so many hilarious memories together.  She is one true friend and I am so blessed to have found her.  Seriously, who waits in the waiting room all day to see their friend's daughter born (the wee hours of her birthday mind you) and then leaves briefly so that her husband could get ready for work...only to find out that the baby was born soon after.  LOL  There is a reason why Nalani was born on her birthday.  I am super convinced of that.  Ironically our daughters, though the 9 month difference (although you would think her daughter was 9 months older than mine) get along extremely well.  They only got to hang out for a few days, but it seems that the "cousins" will be great friends for a very long time.  Heidi and I were talking about our daughters and the trouble they would cause together.  I told her that they would run up some mighty big phone bills.  I don't think it would bother me too much though because Heidi and her family are our family.  They are extremely genuine people who have always embraced us as family.  Anyway, Heidi and I were talking about the future trips to Florida that we are planning.  Ed and I invested in the Disney timeshare.  Yes Ed and I are Disney fanatics.  I will fully admit to that.  So after our nice trip to Florida next Christmas we plan on going on a nice DISNEY cruise....because if my calculations are correct, that is when they are due for another DISNEY cruise...2006, right?  Okay, well I think I am just about done.  I was just excited about the converstaion.  THANKS HEIDI, I would be lost without you!  Damn, too bad you live all the way in NJ!

      I have my senior project.  You know from high school when they decided that in order for you to graduate you had to complete a Senior project.  Anyway, I still have mine and wanted to get it published.  Does anyone know how to go about doing that?  LOL  Maybe it isn't that great, but it holds great sentimental value.  So who knows.  I am extremely bored today.  Can you tell?  Is the three blogs any indication of this boredom?  I am trying not to turn the A/C on....but I am not sure how much longer I can hold off.  It is extremely hot.  I don't want to go into the pool because I refuse to get sun burn.  I got bad sunburn a couple of years ago that took a couple of years to go away (the tan portion).  So anyhow, I am here contemplating life, dreading the next semester and thinking about life after graduation (albeit three years or so from now).  I will be so happy when I get to graduate and see my babies cheering me on...Oh I can't wait.  But baby steps.  I have to remember that each small steps I take are bringing me closer to the goal...I just need to remember that getting closer is better than getting no where.  Well I better get going again...I am going to have to try and stay off this computer and reverting to blogging to procrastinate from cleaning or doing something more productive.

      Damn Menifee is hot as hell!  I am so hot!  You know when it is so hot you just feel like doing nothingbecause it is so damn hot?  LMAO  That is exactly how I feel but I know i have to get some things done because my house is in desparate need of some attention.    I want to pain the house.  Seriously, I want something other than just white walls...they look so BLAH!  I want my room to be some sort of tan color and make it like a beach theme....that way my bathroom would kinda match...what do you think?  I don't know.  I love the beach, I just hate being under the sun and well the ocean, being in it.  haha  The one thing I LOVED doing was going to the beach in Santa Cruz and watching the sunset.  I loved how peaceful it made me feel.  I always wanted a house near the ocean.  I think that is why I miss Oceanside so much.  Our housing was relatively near the ocean.  One day I will be able to buy a house out there and live a happy life...a happier life.

      I got to go to sleep relatively early last night.  I must admit that it is the first time in a long time I have been able to sleep that "early."  Pa is packing right now.  I can't believe he is leaving.  I know that he has to go to work, but when it hits you it still sucks, you know?  I like that our family is relatively close knit.  We have our ups and downs and some of us get on each others nerves more than others...but there is a lot of love there.  So anyway, tomorrow we fight the traffic.  God help us.  LOL  I HATE LAX.  My sisters won't be able to see him off because of their school.  I don't like saying goodbye to people...especially when I know I won't be seeing them for a very long time.  You know?  Ah, sorry for the ramble.  I guess with Pa leaving and then Ed leaving the following month, it is just hitting me hard.  It is hard when they leave.  It is one thing if one just left, but having to see both of them leave...that is a whole other thing.  This is our life I guess.  So how is the week going?  I think pa is taking the kids to Chuck E. Cheese.  The kids are going to love that.  I know Nalani is going to miss papa a lot.  I hope for everyone's sake she doesn't end up crying.

      I can't believe my dad is leaving soon.  It kind of feels like he just got here, but the reality is he has been here for almost a month now.  It sucks that we only get to see him a month out of the year but I know he has to work to finish paying off the bills and all that fun stuff...I just wish he had a regular job.  Who knows.  One day.  I am tired.  I finally cleaned up my desk like I have been promissing to do in the past month.  I FINALLY got to it because my dad was on my ass about it.  Don't get me wrong, I just don't ahve the energy thses days.  I don't sleep all that well at night worrying about Ed leaving.  So during the day I just feel so fatigued. Maybe it would be better if I had someone to hang out with and distract me, you know?  But I don't have that.  All my friends live far away.  Oh well.  Anyway, you guys have a good week.  Thanks for those who read this from time to time and sorry if I ramble along and vent about stupid stuff.  I better get going, have to go and vacuum the downstairs since apparently I am the only one who does.

      Oh what to do, what to do...  I took Tagalog for my foreign language.  I should have been okay because I was supposed to take 9 units and I have 10 units, right?  But no, they are saying that I am going to need 3 semesters.  So I may have to take Spanish.    I guess in all reality that Spanish is actually going to help me especially since I live here in CA.  Not to be stereotypical, but souther California has a large population of hispanics.  So I think that it would be good for me to relearn Spanish.  I guess for the most part I am venting because I am scared that I will fail miserably this semester.  I am taking so many units.  But the reality is that in order for Ed and I to get out from under this debt hole and stop getting parental support...I am going to have to have a career of my own.  The Navy just doens't pay nearly as much as they should.  Ed was telling me stories of some of the guys he is working with.  I must say that for the first time in a long time I am afraid.  He is going into Iraq, a fairly unstable part of it.  The guys he is currently serving with have seen so many unbelievable things.  There is so much going on there.  I worry about his well being.  I worry about our son's well being.  I am scared shitless and well I haven't been able to really talk about it.  See if I cry then I know Ed will feel bad.  I don't want him to have to worry any more than he already does.  Last year he stayed in Kuwait, so even though I was afraid, I knew he would be relatively safe.  Now he is actually going to be in Iraq and I am TERRIFIED.  I just know how unstable things are there.  Then at home I just have to pretend all is well and try and not focus on my fears.  Then night comes and I can't sleep and my mind wanders and I take the time to cry alone.  I am painfully worried.  I feel alone at times, no friends nearby.  The few friends I do have I keep at arms length for fear that I may destroy whatever friendship we have...without knowing it, like with my other friends.  I feel alone in that sense.  I need to get out more.  Maybe I will meet some good people while taking these classes...one can only hope that there will be some mature adults I can make friends with.  Today is one of those "Calgon take me away!" days.

      You gotta love where we live.  It was so HOT!  I thought I was going to cook my brains...maybe I already have.  HAHA  Anyway, this was a  nice chill day,just gambled my coins away during a very nice and friendly match of mahjong.  Gotta love family.  Anyway, this is short and boring, I know.  I am going to get some rest.  I have to take Leila to school since Pa isn't done fixing Ed's piece of junk, oh I meant Civic.  haha  I can't believe Pa is leaving again.  I must admit we are going to really miss the guy, no matter how dorky or how corny he can be, we love him and miss him a lot when he is gone.  Have a great week everyone.  If I am not on here for awhile it is because we are trying to make the most of the time my dad has here.

      I thought this was some good food for thought.  I won't get all political here.  But this is a good way to show that sometimes things can be biased one way or another.  Like my sister said, it is always good to keep an open mind and to read from different sources.  When I get a chance I think I am going to read more into all this.  I just thought I would share the link...only if you are interested.   urlLink Moore   Went bowling yesterday and had a lot of fun.  I left the sisters at the bowling hour for almost 5 hours...SORRY!  I seriously didn't mean to, just had to run around Oceanside yesterday to pick up Ed.  So for Jessica, Leila and Kata, so sorry.  Hey I did pay for the bowling and a pitcher of beer.  Sorry again...and yes I would have been pissed...but if you had a good excuse, I would have understood, after a day...haha  Okay everyone enjoy what is left of the day.

      Okay so after two games I finally got the hang of my new ball...lol  How lame is that?  But it was nice spending time with the family.  Pa is going to go back on his ship soon so we won't be seeing him for maybe another year.  I hope that isn't the case, it would be nice to have him here sooner, but we have to play things by ear.  I can't believe his visit is almost over, this month went by quickly.  Later on today I have to take Bailey to his best friend's birthday party.  He has been waiting for this for weeks now.  I am so excited for him, he hasn't seen his school friends in over a month now.  He msut miss them.  I feel bad about him mot being able to go to school with them this year, but I think it might be for the best.  I am sure things will work out.  I hope they will.  Keep your fingers crossed for me.  Well i shoudl go to bed now.  I don't knwo when Ed will call me to come and get him.  You all have a great weekend...our weekend has started out great.  I hope it stays that way.

      As many of you may already knowmy youngest one has taken a great liking to my mom...okay, let's just say she is more the daughter of my mom than mine.  It is sad sometimes, but I know that she loves her grandmother and that they will have a good relationship, kind of like the one I had with my own grandma before they hauled her off to NJ.  No offense to those who live in Jesrsey...but I hate NJ...okay, I hate Piscataway.  After 10 years with my grandmother, she was taken and I only got to see her once after that.  Then another time to be at her funeral.  I was never closer to any one of my other grandparents, so losing her was a blow.  I think of Alzheimers and think of all the memories and time it had robbed my family.  It really does leave the family with a great whole in their hearts and in their lives because they go to see their loved ones and see that the soul has gone dim and that the person they love and know are now reduced to an empty shell.  I hope my kids never have to experience Alzheimers.  I am sorry for the gloomy bog today.  I had a rough night with the baby.  She cried all night long looking for my mom who happened to be gambling at Pechanga.  Oh there was nothing I could do to comfort her, so she cried herself to sleep.  It didn't help that I took my migraine medicine and so I wasn't feeling all that great.  The other night I thought about my friends and how different our lives have become.  It is interesting, but I am happy with my life.  I do sometimes envy their success, but I have brought some beautifully intelligent little people into this world and know that when they will do great things in life.  My life has been blessed and will continue to be great as long as I stay focused on the things I have and not the things I want.  I was looking at old pictures...life was so simple back then...maybe not, there were still some issues, some serious issues, but at a whole, it was a little more carefree.  I better get going, have to take mom to Camp Pendleton to get her bowling ball.  Have a Happy Friday and great weekend if I don't get to post on here again.

      I tried to blog last night but my frickin' internet was all messed up.  THANKS BLOG  I am offically addicted.  I think because on here I can vent and vent and vent.  LOL  Not very many people read this, thank GOD, but the few that do know me pretty well...for the most part.  I got some good news, Ed will be home tomorrow.  I am excited becaue I don't like when he is gone, it just feels so weird.  I have been productive though, taking care of my college stuff.  I wish I would have just finished my degree at UCSC, but my ass didn't feel comfortable there...my friends were into their own thing (sorority) and getting a place of their own leaving me with no future roommate and hardly ever there...so the only friends I made there were my roomie and the crazy pinay chick on the first floor...aka Trisha.  So here I am, almost 10 years later still trying to finish college.  In my defense, I have been trying to raise three kids and go to school full time while battling health issues, so I know I am doing what I can...it is just frustrating.  I thought I would be done with the JC by the end of SPring, only to find out the requirements for my major have changed, so I have a BUTT TON of classes to take.  Long story short, in this past week I lost my two scholarships because apparently my college put me up for scholarships that require you to be at a four year...dumbasses...I don't even have enough to transfer...DUH!   So there goes $1300...I was told, "Honey, at least you know you could get scholarships."  Thanks, but I needed the money.  So anyway, I have decided to continue my JC education at another school closer to home to save on gas (school was about 50 miles away) and well to be closer to home.  So that makes it my decision to pull Bailey out of St. Mary's (okay so I don't really have a choice in that, he is on a waiting list) and Bailey and Nalani will be at the same school.  Nalani will be going full day on Tuesday and Thursday.  I think it will be good for them.  If I don't like the schools, I will have to option of putting them in another one when I transfer to CSUSM.  Please pray I stay healthy this year so that I can finish at the JC level and move on to the Cal State level.  I really am itchin' to get that degree.  It is more the fact that I want to contribute to the family finances that doesn't require me to work retail, odd hours and well not that well paying.  I need something secure and that will prevent us from living from paycheck to paycheck.  You know what I mean?  Anyway, that was my week in a nutshell...uneventful, huh?  Well I don't know what else to say at this point, maybe I will blog later.  I am going to look through my schedule.  Yes I am taking 19 frickin' units.  God Bless me.  Please just let me get through this.

      Ed called yesterday...well I suppose that you can say a couple of days ago now...and it was nice to hear from him.  I do miss him.  I guess absence makes the heart grow fonder is true.  I can't sleep because my dad sabotaged us with bad shrimps...I can't imagine it being anything else.  But who knows, I am no expert, but my stomach hurts like a SOB.  UGH  I can't go to bed it hurts so much...so what do I do...I go on here nad blog...pathetic, I know.  I know I should be sleeping.  I was mad because I had a blog and then it didn't go through.  I hate my computer right now because we are being plagued with the frickin' pop ups and we lose our internet connection every now and then...I HATE LIVING in BFE.  Our cable connection sucks...not to mention our frickin' cell phones...don't get me started on that.  We have been playing MAHJONG.  Fun stuff.  I ahve been playing video games with Bailey too.  I really need to get out, I am gaining weight again.  I haven't tried the SBD that my friend has been raving about (with good reason too, she looks great...not like she didn't look great before...).  Well first of all, I don't think I will do well on this SBD, but also because my dad is here for a few more days and well it would be hard to give up filipino food while he is here.  Anyway, my tummy calls again.  So I think I will lay down for a bit.

      Well here we go, I dropped off Ed this morning.  I don't like the route he takes to work.  I don't think it is safe, so I am going to talk to him about that when he gets back.  I didn't take that route back because seriously it was like Tahoe and well I have a tendency to get car sick and well that wouldn't be a good idea.  WE hung out for awhile and just talked, me him and pa.  It was funny because we all decided that as much as we love my cousin Alisson, she was a holy terror and a half.  I mean hello.  My aunt and uncle do not know how to keep their kids in line.    Okay for example, they let their daughter wander around the house with no diaper so Ed catches her peeing all ove rour carpet...GROSS  And of course, they laugh and say, "Alisson, that's not good."  Everytme she does something that is all she gets, that sentence and then a laugh...it is no wonder she doesn't listen.  Then she had a bowl of watermelon and just threw it on the floor and splattered the juice everywhere...and yes my aunt and uncle giggled and gave her that sentence...UGH  I love kids, but come on, you want them to listen to them, let them know that they do something wrong by showing a little bit more authority and not laughing at everything.  I feel bad because she is my god-daughter...well Ed's, but mine by marriage of course...but she is so bad.  She just turned two this weekend.  I feel so awful as I type this, but damn...the girl really gets away with a lot.  Anyhow that was our weekend.  Here goes 20+ days of me rambling about missing Ed.  I am sorry if I end up whining but I really do feel incomplete when he is gone...not in a bad way, just that my other half is missing.  I know this training is needed though in order for him to be "safe" in Iraq.  Have a very good week everyone.  I hope that you all will have a productive week.  We are going to TRY to make it to Disneyland.

      I hope that everyoen had a nice 4th of July.  It was a nice day to just relax with the family, played Mahjong...who doesn't like playing Mahjong?  Anyhow, I haven't heard from Tim and Keiko and figure that this is they way it will be.  Just let go.  So I am growing increasingly anxious with Ed leaving in a few hours.  I know that it is just for training, but for him being gone that long after being home for a year...it just doesn't feel normal.  I have to get used to it though because he will be gone for over 7 months and that is the reality of it all.  Why do things like this have to happen?  You know, why do men and women have to go away from their family for so long?  Why aren't people more grateful for the things that they do, the sacrifices they make so that we can enjoy fireworks and celebrate our independence...I guess I just answered my own question.  Well I should head off because I have to take him to work tomorrow.  I am going to miss Ed.

      Okay, well obviously my views do not "mesh" well with other people's views in politics.  I try to be open-minded and actually don't really tell what I stance I take on several things.  Mostly because I know that there are people I love dearly who are completely opposite of me.  Anyway, there was a alady on one of my so called groups that was completely bashing everything going on in Iraq.  Yes, I hate the fact that all this is going on.  I hate that Ed has to go out there...but....never mind.    I don't want to go any further without offending anyone.  Yes I am a Republican, but I liek to think that I am an educated one and that I do not just vote strictly Republican.  I vote for the best candidate even if he/she is a democrat.  Anyway, enough politics.  Despite what people think, we can all throw this on Bush's feet and hang him.  In America we have a democracy and a President, however powerful they maybe, does not have the power to make decisions on his own...at least that is what I learned...but hey I am not saying I am completely knowledgeable on this either.  So if you "school" me, the point well be well taken.  I bet I have less friends now that I have divulged that I am a Republican...lol

      Well it should quite an interesting day...they don't even know who is coming...OH GREAT!  It seems kind of gloomy today...which is too bad, it would have been nice to have a sunny party, but maybe this is better...  I am still tired, I want to go to bed.  I am kind of sleepy.  Sorry for all the rambling.  I am just trying to stay up here for as long as IO can.  I don't know how long that will be.  I have decided I want to be an Iron Chef...damn...too bad I don't know how to cook like that.  LOL  Oh well, one can dream.  Enough rambling, I will go down and finish cleaning...BLEH!

      Have you ever had one of those days where you just feel so tired and completely irritable?  I am having one of those days.  My dad was kind enough to volunteer our house for my cousins' birthday party and well let's just say this...they are a terror and I am not even in the mood to clean because I know that it would be pointless because those darn kids are going to wreck the house in under an hour flat.  I am so serious.  I LOVE KIDS but I think that being around them for as long as I have with no real vacation or down time...I think I am going insane and the sad part is, I want to be a teacher.  LOL  No but really.  I am the most responsible parent there is...well one of the most, I have my faults...but I think I am more responsible than other moms out there.  My children are my life and you can ask anyone who knows me.  I think that is why my life has been so stressful.  I don't take the time out for me.  I think that maybe that is what I need...a mini break...not to mention a mini break from my family.  LOL  (Except for Ed...I want to spend as much time as I can with him.)  Unfortunately Iraq ia so many miles away and unlike Inman (Cold Mountain), he cannot walk back home to me.  LOL  But after watching that movie, I can't help but think how strong love can be, even though it is a "hollywood" version of romance...it touched me...I will admit it.  Sad note...Ed had to get rid of Sparky the snake...We still have Stitch...however annoying he can be at times...

      We had a lot of fun and I think the kids really enjoyed themselves...we got season passes because honestly who can pass up $9.95 a month or $7.95 for children?  We couldn't....hell season passes are the best way to keep kids busy during the summer...just have to be smart about packing a lunch.  I hope you guys all have a very HAPPY 4th of July.  Ed is going to be home until the 4th and won't be home until the 25th.  Geez...I hardly get to see him these days.  I pray that God give me the strength to get through the time he is gone and that God keeps him safe from harm.  I know all I can do is pray.  I am starting to have a hard tims sleeping at night due to anxiety.  ...and the cycle starts...

      Hello everyone, did ya miss me? I know, I know, one good day of not reading Lanie vent about pointless stuff. haha  Before I go on..please check this website out.   urlLink Bailey's AHA Webpage   He is doing so well with the help of people with HUGE hearts. In the past we have had so many good friends go out of their way to help us raise money by spreading the word to their own family, friends and co-workers. This is even more true today.  I know I have mentioned Riss before. She is a friend of a friend, but slowly via internet we have started a friendship. I enjoy her candid and insightful thoughts. She has two beautiful twin daughters and still manages to look amazing! But aside from that she has a HUGE heart and spread the word to her friends and now her very generous friends have made contributions. Sometimes we take things for granted in life, I know I have quite a few times, but I want to change that.  So Riss and all your wonderful friends...THANK YOU! (Please pass the thanks to your friends, Riss). And THANK YOU to all my friends who make donations year after year, Curie, Keiko, JoAnn, and of course Heidi... gosh if I missed you. THANK YOU!  I am so amazed by how wonderful people can be. I only wish that everyone else is as blessed as my family and I are when it comes to friends and family.  You guys have a good weekend. I don't know how much I will be on because today I have to clean for the in-laws. I look forward to seeing them and I know that Ed and the kids are overjoyed. =) You ALL ROCK! Thanks for being such great friends. I know I am in a funk a lot of times but thanks for staying patient with me.

      Okay, Mica is kicking butt!  She is really doing her part to help raise money for the AHA.  I am so proud of her.  It takes a lot to have to ask your friends and family to help out, but in the end it is for a great cause.  I am so happy to have her on our team.  THANKS MICA!  I can't blog too long tonight.  I have to get up early to make the drive down to Carlsbad.  Bailey and I will be speaking at a rally.  I am actually pretty excited.  Wish us luck!  Hope you are all having a great week...no word on Bailey yet.  He has an ultrasound scheduled for next week.  He is still swollen but it doesn't seem to affect him.  BLAH!

      It is so hot in Menifee.  I swear.  I am sure it isn't hot like in other places.  I should be grateful that it isn't hot AND humid, but still it is hot.  I think we should start making use of the pool again.  No one has used it since Pa left...maybe that is why.  I miss the guy, no matter how insane he can drive me, I miss him.  I wish more than anything that he were home with us, but again, I know why he has to be gone.  Another stressful day and a seemingly endless battle with migraines.  Save me.  I have called my doctor and he can't see me until the 20th...well I am not waiting that long.  So I scheduled an appointment for sometime on Wednesday. I know I am bad with times...so hopefully I will remember by then.  I think it is at ten.  I hate going to the doctor, but hey, what can you do?  So today I went to my financial aide information class.  I got a lot of information that I needed....THANK GOD!  But also found out that I am going to be screwed next year if I don't get out of the community college level.  I run the risk of losing my financial aid.  OH NO!  I really want to get this college thing done, but I can't control the health issues that have come up with me and my son.  I guess I can try and appeal.  We will see.  I was so bummed though.  I think that added onto my stress.  Oh and the lady I spoke with at financial aid gave me the wrong disbursement date.  She said that we would get our grants a week before school so we could get our books, but it seems as though they aren't coming in until a couple of weeks after school starts...hmmm...how am I going to buy my books?  Anyhow, I hope you all had a great weekend.  I know I plan on doing a lot of cleaning because my in-laws are coming this Friday.  It should be fun.

      Okay I HATE migraines.  I hate the worry I am going through this past month and well I am just plain angry.  I feel trapped, like I don't have anyone to talk to, but I know I have a few good friends who have told me countless times to call them when I need.  I am too embarrassed or maybe too afraid of losing my friends.  It is the one tough thing about losing two good friends at one time, you become afraid.   like Heidi, my NJ friend, she has stuck by me through some of the toughest times in my married life and she has asked countless times to lean on her.  But I guess all these feelings of anxiety come around this time, at night and I know she has two little girls and it would not be right to call this late.  UGH  Then these miserable migraines have kept me from doing the things I need to do.  I am so  FRUSTRATED !  Anyway, that is it.  I have to talk to a bunch of doctors tomorrow.  Wish me luck!
