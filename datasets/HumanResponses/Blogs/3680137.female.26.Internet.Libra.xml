      Bought the wedding present at Bed Bath & Beyond, where the wedding couple has a registry. They called for two wood breakfast-in-bed trays, and that's what I got them. As my small perverted way of encouraging them to spend lots of time in bed. Because they're such a wholesome, squeaky-clean Christian couple, so their sex appeal as a couple isn't exactly in-your-face, which is a good thing - I like that. And so the idea of their bedding one another is cute to me. If they were like the vast majority of couples, I wouldn't give a flying frig about their sexual habits - I'd get them dinner plates or something.  Bed Bath & Beyond, what a wonderland. I absolutely love the place and places like it. So much that it hurts to be there because I can't afford the merchandise I want to have, and I can't afford a place of my own for which to buy merchandise. I love the place, the way it smells, and its expansiveness, and all the colors. They do free gift-wrapping when you buy from a gift registry with them, and they wrapped my gift very beautifully.

      So, am I doing this blog thing right so far? I guess I'm not so tongue-tied after all. Not when it comes to the written word. Stilted, maybe. I don't know who I'm writing to, so I don't quite know how to tailor my posts, and that makes me feel a little weird. Since this is publicly accessible, I'm far less gritty and graphic and profane as I otherwise would be. In other words, I'm just as uninteresting and off-putting everywhere else if not more. I'm also tremendously much dumber than I let on here. Anyway, I doubt that anyone besides myself has been to this blog. And I don't exactly expect to be attracting a "readership" anytime soon. This is for my entertainment purposes only.  I'm of Catholic heritage, but before I attended CB Church for the first time last Sunday, I'd been to a couple non-denominational, traditional Christian churches with the friend of mine whose twin sister's wedding I'm attending this weekend. And those were appealing experiences. But out of respect for Christianity - I'm referring to the traditional sense of the institution, whatever that means, not any new-agey, wishy-washy, anything-goes offshoots - I would not go so far as to say that I'm a Christian, because I can't truthfully say that I understand and follow and believe in what Christianity is. Again, I'm referring to the traditional sense of the institution, whatever that means, because if I weren't, then it wouldn't matter whether I call myself a Christian or not.   I simply like the concept of being among people in my peer group who are Christians, namely the devout traditional sort. I just feel that Christians are among the least likely to be judgemental or snub me for my unhip moral convictions. Not that Christians necessarily share my unhip moral convictions, because statistically the majority of self-proclaimed Christians do not. If I'm being cryptic right now, then either it's deliberate, or it's because I don't know what I'm talking about. Anyhow, CB Church sponsors a singles Bible study group at somebody's house Friday nights, and I plan on joining. Like a singles bar, except not a singles bar but a Bible study.  I'm of Filipino-Catholic heritage. My definition of that is Spanish-Catholic with scintillas of paganism that surface once in a while. Like when my mom offers a bowl of fruit to a big Buddha statue for luck because she's seen it done and thinks it's cute and thinks it might actually accomplish something. I guess that's to be expected of a country where so many different peoples have staked claims.  I want a non-denominational, traditional Christian church (i.e., CB Church) because there seems to be a lot of emphasis in the Catholic Church on rituals and statues and objects that I find distracting and not pertinent to my life. I find Catholicism and Catholic things fiercely beautiful, and I appreciate and revere that part of my heritage, but all the grandeur and shiny things and whatnot obscure the point for me, whatever the point is. It's my fault that I have attention deficit disorder in the Catholic Church, but be that as it may, my experiences in non-denominational Christian churches have struck more of a chord in me. There's been more of a didactic quality, like a college course lecture, in the non-denominational Christian church services I've attended, and that speaks to me better, and I respond to that better.   I went to CB Church by myself. I have no one to attend with. As I was making my way through the CB Church campus to the worship center, where services are held, I found I was surrounded by whites, and that intimidated me, and then I felt somewhat relieved when I saw a girl who looked like she could be ethnic, and then my fears were put to rest when I saw blacks. I'm sure that says something about me, but I don't feel like attempting to articulate it at the moment.  I don't think everybody needs a Christian God. People can be perfectly good and perfectly happy without a Christian God. In certain circles of Christianity, I'm a huge sinner for proclaiming that, and I accept that. If anybody needs a Christian God, it's a sinner, and I'm a sinner.

      Today I dropped off two blouses and two pairs of pants at the dry cleaner's so that they're nice and fresh for me to wear this upcoming weekend. They're clothes I bought within the last couple weeks. I love new clothes.  I love how couture nowadays includes styles inspired by the 1920s and the 1950s, even mixing the 1920s and 1950s together. I just love that. Those decades particularly intrigue me, the 1920s because of the whole flapper girl, Charleston dance thing, and the 1950s because of the whole "I Love Lucy" thing and whatnot. Weren't the 1950s a backlash against the 1920s, interestingly enough? I also like the late 1800s, early 1900s Gibson girl thing; I wonder what the chances are of styles from that period being voguishly reincarnated.   I'm driving about three hours north to San Luis Obispo Friday evening to attend a friend's twin sister's wedding on Saturday. I'm staying at my friend's place along with a friend of hers until Sunday. After church and lunch with my friend and her friend on Sunday, I'm driving two and a half or so hours further north to the Monterey Peninsula to meet my ex-boyfriend at a restaurant for dessert, and then I'm driving back to LA. I don't know how long I'll be hanging out with my ex - probably not long, because chances are he doesn't like me much - I called him up and asked him to go out for dessert with me, because I really miss him and still love him, and he said yes probably just to be nice. If I were to never call him and never drive up to see him, I would never hear from him or see him. We broke up at the beginning of last December, and I'm still not over him. I still throw fits over him. I didn't want to break up. I'm still having a difficult time dealing with it.  I find that I really like going on road trips and driving long distances by myself as long as it's a leisurely drive (i.e., not for the purpose of meeting a dreaded or important appointment), I know where I'm going (i.e., I don't get lost), and I have music that I'm really into. If I couldn't have music in the car, then a road trip would be painful and pointless. It's all about the music. I like road trips much, much better during the day than at night because the day is so much more scenic. On a road trip at night, the world is a black mass.  Today I bought three domain names, of course with money I don't have. Three just to have like pretty trinkets and baubles, because I like pretty trinkets and baubles. I think I'll use them in the creation of different Web design concepts for my portfolio. A design concept certainly doesn't require a domain name, but the domain name contributes to the look and feel of a site in the way that the title of a poem or song helps set the mood for the poem or song. I love the canned template of this blog - it's an inspiration to me. I'm really digging this color scheme - if it were clothing, I would really rejoice in wearing it. I will definitely steal this color scheme. I wanted to buy a fourth domain name - Shepherdess.com, but that's taken. I registered the domain names with DynoNames.com, but I think I want HostGator.com to host them, and I want reseller Web hosting - I just need to figure out which reseller package I want.  Watched the movie  Along Came Polly  on DVD with my sister. It's cute - I enjoyed it. I usually shun romantic comedies.

      Just got back from the Japanese restaurant Momotaro in Burbank. It was a belated birthday dinner for my mom. I ordered a big sashimi platter and an Asahi beer. That's a great beer for a beer that's not black. Guinness is my favorite beer. Guinness is black. Negra Modelo is another beer that I like. Sushi is my absolute favorite food. And there's never enough wasabi to go with it. Just like there's never enough tabasco sauce on anything. I like my wasabi with a side of sushi. One of the greatest things in life is that wasabi headrush.  My sister, my brother, and my brother's wife, stepson, sister-in-law and baby daughter were at the restaurant too. I shared the beer with my brother because he wanted to - otherwise I would have finished it all myself; it came in a big bottle. My dad didn't go, probably because he had chemo a few days ago and so wasn't feeling up to it. He's undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer. He's always had a tendency to opt to stay home when the rest of us go out, though. He's doing really well. He goes to work. He went back to work a few weeks ago, after a 6-week-or-so hiatus after undergoing surgery to remove tumors from his lungs. He doesn't look sick. He has chemo every three weeks. He's 67 but looks younger than a lot of 67-year-olds. He's bald, but it becomes him. He had his head shaved before the chemo could make his hair fall out.  My brother's a Marine corporal, and he says he might have to go back to Iraq as early as next month. He went there when the war began and came back home in May 2003, and now he's supposed to go back again. Hopefully something happens so that he doesn't have to go back.

      Last Friday evening, I went to Charlotte Russe in the Glendale Galleria and bought a new outfit consisting of a rose-printed, semi-transparent, long-sleeved white blouse, which I like to wear with the sleeves rolled up a little, and long white slacks. I love wearing white. Not that I often wear white. My three favorite colors are white, red, and black. I had wanted to buy from Rampage but opted for Rampage's much, much less pricey sister company Charlotte Russe instead because I'm broke. Besides, I had already purchased almost $200 worth of stuff at Rampage the previous weekend, to wear to my baby niece's baptism and baptism party and my cousin's 8th grade graduation that weekend. (My cousin was valedictorian. He's a great, great kid.) Then I went to The Scream Shoe Shop, also in the Glendale Galleria, and bought a pair of Playboy-brand heels to go with the outfit. I hadn't been planning to buy shoes, but the pant legs of those slacks are really long and called for heels - otherwise they'd be dragging on the ground when I wore them - and I didn't have heels that would match. The heels I bought are backless and seamless and synthetic, made of a white, plastic or quasi-plastic man-made material, with a clear plastic or quasi-plastic open toe tacked on. The toes are punched with chic little holes and embossed with the Playboy Bunny.   Somehow I very much fancy things that are marked with the Playboy Bunny, except for the magazine. (And I also really like Bettie Page memorabilia, though I don't have a single such thing. Once I move out of my parents' house, whenever the time comes that I can afford to, one of the first things I'm going to want to have is a set of Bettie Page coasters. I also love "I Love Lucy" memorabilia and ladybug stuff.) Once again, I spent lots of money that I didn't have (used credit card).   I bought the white outfit and heels to wear to another cousin's graduation ceremony Saturday morning, the next day. (She's not my cousin by blood but by "culture"; I'm Filipino, and she's Filipino, and in Filipino culture, no blood relation is required for people to refer to each other as cousins - people call each other cousins arbitrarily. Namely when they are in the same peer group, and they are very familiar with one another, and their families are very familiar with one another.) She graduated with a B.S. from the UCLA School of Nursing. She gets her Master's from the UCLA School of Nursing next year. She's got a really bright future ahead of her.   I hate graduation ceremonies, and weddings and the like, but I really should attend these things when I'm invited because I really should at the very least go through the motions of reveling in other people's joys and successes, because I don't want to be overwhelmingly, self-defeatingly self-centered anymore, and then maybe one day I'll actually be a reveler in other people's joys and successes. In other words, I really should pretend to be nice, and then maybe one day the niceness will become mine and I'll actually be nice. I should make people *want* to invite me to their graduations and their weddings. I'm actually going to a wedding this upcoming weekend. A wedding I asked to be invited to, in my effort to be less self-centered and more nice. A friend's twin sister's wedding in San Luis Obispo. I'm driving up to San Luis on Friday evening to attend the wedding on Saturday.   The heels make my feet hurt and give me blisters, and when I walk in them, the spikes of the shoes very slightly bend underneath me, I guess because that's the nature of the synthetic material they're made of, and the bending causes the very points of the spikes to sort of gnash against the ground, which causes a squeaking noise. And that's annoying. But I like the way they look.   Sunday, Father's Day, yesterday, I attended service at a certain church - let's call it CB Church. It was my first time there. I liked it. It's not just a church - it's a collection of venues - it's like a small campus. In fact, it's referred to as a campus on their website. Then I had lunch with my parents and my uncle at the Manila Buffet in Glendale. The restaurant is under new management, and the owner is from the same province that my parents are from - Oas, Albay, Philippines. It was my mom's birthday. Then I went home and washed my car and watched the movie  Monster  on DVD with my sister and her friend and cleaned my budgies' cage and cleaned my hamster's cage and did laundry.   I'm at work right now, apparently busy with foolishness unrelated to my hourly-wage-slavery job. Tonight I have a ballet class, and it'll be the last class in the session. I don't think I'll be signing up for anymore such frivolous night classes for a while because I'm looking for a night-shift job.

      I've been wanting a blog for years. Now that I have one, I hardly know what to do with it. I am nervous and self-conscious about it. It'll be a long time before I feel relatively at ease writing here, if ever. Until then, I am tongue-tied and stilted.

      A friend expressed to me in an email that he associates Christians - serious Christians, the sort against whom bigotry is chic - with being avoidant of knowledge, avoidant of learning, "weak-minded."   But out of my increasing interest in my church, I am getting so much more to learn, more to think about, more to struggle with. Not less. My church does not dismiss me from learning and thinking. Au contraire. The Christian thing turns out to be just another struggle for me. I came to my church seeking refuge, and I got that, but much more than that, I got another struggle.  I am learning lessons on how to be a decent person. I'm not saying that only the lessons my church teaches on how to be a decent person are worthwhile. I'm just saying that I am responding to lessons in my church.  But I still cannot truthfully say that I am a Christian. Especially out of respect to Christianity. I revere Christianity too much to call myself a Christian - it would be blasphemy.

      A sentence from  Atonement  that strikes a chord:    There was desperation in all she said, an emptiness at its core, or something excluded or unnamed that made her talk faster, and exaggerate with less conviction.    It strikes a chord, of course, because it reminds me of myself. When something in art - literature, music, movies, photography, whatever - reminds me of myself, then and only then do I love it. Any interest I have in art proceeds from my search for myself - my love-hate, attraction-repulsion infatuation with my own reflection. (Hence this one-way mirror of a blog.) Actually, it's not so much art I'm referring to but anything esthetic, such as a finely built house or a well-designed kitchen appliance. Not that a house or a kitchen appliance isn't art. In esthetics, I look for myself first and foremost. And only in esthetics do I condone such narcissism on my part. Everywhere else, that narcissism is something I regret and hate.  My love affair with Ivory soap has ended amicably. We're friends. We still hook up. I've started seeing Dove.  I am considering "Jinjer" as a porn star name for myself. That's "Jinjer" with two j's. As for a surname, that's still up in the air - let me get back to you.  Potential digital art concept: "Helena Handbasket." Or "To Helena Handbasket." I don't know what that means, yet. But it's a potential digital art concept in a vein similar to "Ground Apple." By "Ground Apple," I'm not referring to this blog - I'm referring to the term "ground apple" and what it could connote and inspire. Some other time, I'll explain why the term "ground apple" preoccupies me.  Hmmm, "Jinjer Handbasket"... Maybe. Come to think of it, "Helena Handbasket" is worth consideration as a porn star name too.

      Recently I spent several hours researching anti-spyware/adware tools and downloaded some. I find the following most helpful:  urlLink Ad-aware ,  urlLink Spybot - Search & Destroy ,  urlLink Spy Sweeper , and  urlLink Sygate Personal Firewall . The first three do a search of your computer and snoop out spyware/adware so that you can then delete it. Sygate Personal Firewall alerts you when something in your computer tries to have unauthorized access to a network - tries to "gossip" with a network about goings-on in your computer, as I understand it - or when a network tries to have unauthorized access to your computer.  Ad-aware and Spybot, both freeware, are the two most renown anti-spyware/adware tools. But Spy Sweeper got rid of "Second Thought" spyware/adware on my computer that stubbornly evaded Ad-aware and Spybot. One tool will often compensate for another's limitation, so it helps to have an assortment. The free download of Spy Sweeper is a version that will function for a limited time, and then you're supposed to purchase it. I'm thinking it might be worth purchasing, though the general consensus is that it's hardly ever necessary to  purchase  an anti-spyware/adware tool.  I also have  urlLink HijackThis ,  urlLink SpywareBlaster , and  urlLink IE-SPYAD , but I'm not sure how much of a difference those make in light of the others I mentioned.  The aforementioned tools don't put a once-and-for-all end to spyware/adware on my computer - junk always gets into my computer somehow. I guess that goes with the territory of having an Internet cable connection. I have to run Ad-aware, Spybot, and Spy Sweeper about every couple days to stay on top of the junk, and every time I do, new items of spyware/adware to be rid of are found. But at least there's a big dent in the hold that spyware/adware has over my computer, I'm pretty sure.  There are forms of spyware/adware out there that actually pretend to be anti-spyware/adware tools. They get into your computer and make it go haywire with spyware/adware and then pop a message at you that says, "Your computer going haywire with spyware/adware? Buy me, and I'll fix that!" So be careful.  urlLink Rogue/Suspect Anti-Spyware Products & Websites  outlines known forms of spyware/adware that pretend to be anti-spyware/adware tools.

      I'm working on a personal logo in Adobe Illustrator 8.0, and when I tried opening the file last night, the following message popped up for no apparent reason:   Can't open the illustration. The illustration contains an incomplete or garbled object description.  Offending operator: "XP"  Context: [serial number-like gibberish]   I clicked  OK , and the file opened, but it was a horrifying mutant version of what it was supposed to look like. Repeatedly closing and opening the file and restarting my computer didn't fix the problem.  I started having a panic attack because I'd been working painstakingly on this logo for a little more than a week.  I did some Google research, and I got the idea somewhere to make a copy of the file (in case tinkering with the original file would corrupt the file even more), open the copy in WordPad (it was too big for Notepad), and remove all instances of "XP" - the said "offending operator." There were very many instances of "XP" - I chose "Replace" from the Edit menu, entered "XP" in the "Find what:" slot in the ensuing box, left the "Replace with:" slot blank, checkmarked the "Match case" box, and clicked the "Replace All" button. I saved the changes, and the (copy of the) file opened in Illustrator just fine, looking right as rain.   My logo is a depiction of a woman in a ballroom dress on her hands and knees, apparently having tripped and fallen, her head cracked open like an egg, her brain in a puddle of blood in front of her like an egg yolk in egg white. Don't worry - she's alive and well, perhaps a tad dazed. The intention is for this depiction to be elegant and stylish. We'll see how it goes.  The logo is based on "Scatterbrained Haste," which comes from a poem that I wrote, a poem that apparently I think I am pretty clever for having written.

      There's a new, sweet, nice fruity smell in the house, and I figured out why it's giving me vague visions and feelings of college living from a bygone age and thus distressing me: It's coming from a Glade plug-in, or some other brand of plug-in air freshener, and I smelled it before in a college dorm. Either I used it in my own dorm room, or it wafted from somebody else's, in an era long ended by which I remain traumatized, although it was the happiest and most productive era of my life thus far, as lonely and anxiety-ridden as it was.   Happiest in large part because Kevin was my boy for almost two out of those three and a half years. Kevin was mah dawg, yo. Most productive in large part because I had made a decent name for myself as an actor of campus-wide scope. That is, of the scope of a very small, insular, obscure little state university campus where application for admission does not require an essay. Overall, I was odd girl out, and still am.  College living. The illicit yet widely tolerated burning of candles and incense. Blacklight-responsive decorative objects (they glow in the radiance of a blacklight). Lava lamps, year-round Christmas lights, colorful gauzy fabrics hung against a ceiling to diffuse a fluorescent ceiling lamp, and other de rigueur forms of college-student decor. Inflatable furniture and fuzzy picture frames. Pink and glitter and feather boas and animal prints and faux fur and pleather. The obligatory bean bag, mini fridge, hot pot, and stash of instant noodle soup packages. Pictures and mementos that college students post on their dorm doors and dorm walls to show what individuals they are, what differences they make, that they're part of some revolution.  Pot. Wanton dorm sex. Hot and humid, dank and sticky, steaming, stinking, wanton dorm sex. Perhaps while third parties (e.g. roommates) bear witness. (I didn't have a roommate - I always opted for a single at the cost of an extra few hundred bucks, hermit that I was. In case I wanted to have  discreet  wanton dorm sex - yeah, sure.) In the common areas, free condoms of assorted colors, flavors, and textures (your student activities fees at work), served among lollipops in candy jars, or in baskets decorated with ribbon, when otherwise your RA (resident advisor) is at your door and flamboyantly throwing the condoms at you like it's Mardi Gras. (Drop by your campus health center for a sweetmeat of birth control that's more potent and perhaps after-the-fact.)   Pot. Dorm sex stank galore. Indignant whitegirls aplenty, beating their breasts and rending their garments and railing and wailing against The Patriarchy. However, to be fair, the indignant whitegirls do their beating and rending and railing and wailing alongside very many male comrades and comrades of color, and to that extent, it's irrelevant that the indignant whitegirls are either white or female. An energetic ambience, sparkling with hip, youthful vigor, where to take repose from teach-ins, rallies, protests, marches, and candlelight vigils. Yeah, dude. Kewl. Fight the power. Sweet.  Riiiiiight.  A rectangular glass bottle of Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue perfume fell on my right foot today - a corner of it punctured a tiny wound into my foot. The wound started out as a black dot in a dim bedroom and immediately welled up and spilled over. I put a bandaid on it. I don't remember the last time I had an injury that called for a bandaid.

      I think I caught a cold from my niece. She's only 8 and a half months old, though, so if I caught a cold from her, then it's a baby-strength cold.  My parents bought a bag of dehydrated mango from Costco this past weekend per my request, but my brother - the baby's daddy - took off with it, to his house on Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base. I love Costco.

      On the way to work today, I remembered something very mundane that happened when I was a kid: When I was a kid, I was riding shotgun in the car, and either we were stopped in traffic, or traffic was very slow; and there was a flower delivery van on the road to the right of us and slightly ahead of us. I was looking at the driver of the van in his side view mirror; he looked like John Denver - he had John Denver hair, and he wore glasses. And he caught me looking at him in his side view mirror, and he smiled at me via his side view mirror. That's how I remember it; the details may not all be correct, but I'm pretty sure something at least very close to that happened. I don't remember whether I smiled back. Not sure why I remembered this very trivial occurrence - I didn't see a flower delivery van today, and it happened almost two decades ago.

      Thursday night, I had dinner at a chain chicken fast food restaurant called Koo Koo Roo's in Studio City with my friend/co-worker. It was my first Koo Koo Roo's experience. I had a caesar salad with a side of some kind of orange squash mashed, and a lemonade. It was all right. It would have been great for a homemade meal, but it was mediocre for a restaurant. We went to my friend's apartment with the vague intention of working on his resume, but we ended up watching TV instead. I was very smitten with his roommate's pet bearded dragon. I found the scaly little beast very bird-like, like a lot of lizards are - the way he would look at me, an avian sort of intelligence in his eyes, and how he would move his head. His poop was like a bird's too. I found him very cute - I almost wanted to kiss his pointy lizard lips.  Saturday night, I saw the movie  Dodgeball  with my brother, sister, and my brother's wife and stepson. I wasn't all that impressed with it, but I was surrounded by people who were laughing uproariously. Then we went bowling, at which I suck. My brother bought me a Corona at the bowling alley. I had asked for a Guinness, but they didn't have that.  Lately, out of the blue, I'm having a love affair with Ivory soap, craving the bitter generic scent of it, and marveling at the history of it - Ivory.com says the first bar of Ivory soap was sold in 1879. I look forward to washing my hands with Ivory soap, and showering with Ivory soap. It makes me sting a little in sensitive places, but somehow I like that - somehow the stinging feels healthy. Not just healthy (here's my chance to use a million-dollar word, and also an opportunity to use italics) -  salubrious .  I've started reading the book  Atonement  by Ian McEwan. Here's a quote from it: "And she liked the fact that he was so tall. It was an interesting combination in a man, intelligence and sheer bulk." My sentiments exactly, although every guy whom there were the slightest grounds for calling my boyfriend was short. There haven't been many guys whom I could remotely call my boyfriend - I'd say there have been three such guys, but I'm of average height for a woman, and they were all either my height or no more than an inch taller, meaning they were short. I think I'm 5 feet, 5.5 inches. It would be so nice to have a boyfriend and be able to stand in high, high heels and put my face in his neck without having to crouch or stoop.

      I bought a journal at Barnes & Noble last night. A journal handmade in India. I bought it to take notes in when I'm attending church service or Bible study or any sort of class or lecture or seminar sponsored by the church. It's very thick on account of its very thick, cardboard-like pages, although it really doesn't have all that many pages in it. The tag that was attached to it gives this testimonial:  "Its uneven, deckle-edge pages give this handcrafted journal a distinctive appearance.   "The pages, produced from wood-free cotton refuse, are processed and cut by hand.   "The finished product is a unique and ecologically sound place to record your thoughts."   Deckle-edge, eh. So, that's the term to describe a bundle of bulky pages with uneven, unruly edges. Like clothing haphazardly folded and packed into a suitcase. I like it. I like its unrefined, primitive look. It looks kind of like an ancient, worn book. Like an old, vigorously used Bible, actually. People are going to think it's a Bible, and that all I do with my time is thumb through my Bible and that I'm some kind of Bible wizard. It also looks like a book that's been through a washer and dryer. Writing in it gives me some kind of primal, animal pleasure, like how clenching my jaws with my retainers on until there's pain or picking off a scab does. What's annoying, though, is that the pages have this rough, bumpy surface, but I think the annoyance is a necessary factor in the primal, animal pleasure. The nuzzling of my penpoint into the craquelure of the paper is like my teeth sinking into a piece of firm yet yielding pastry or fudge.  There's something magical about a bound bundle of pages that are either all blank or all written in. When, say, half of the pages are blank, and half written in, it's not so magical.   I just want to mention that I notice that Oscar winner Adrien Brody is featured lately in a Diet Coke commercial in which he doesn't say a single word but nonetheless is being very cute. I don't know much about Adrien Brody, as I don't know much about any celebrity, but I do know that he is capable of being very cute - case in point, this Diet Coke commercial. Anyway, I don't do diet sodas.

       Are not five sparrows sold for two cents? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.  Luke 12:6  It's the only one I know, really.

      I was at that Bible study from about 7:30 pm to about 1 in the morning. I hadn't expected to be there that long, but it just turned out that I stayed that long. This Bible study group is geared towards singles. There were a few hours of lecture and discussion, followed by a couple hours of "fellowship," which was basically conversation and refreshments. During the lecture part (calling it a lecture makes it sound more formal than it was, but I don't know what other term to use), one of the group members gave testimony about how he became a Christian and what Christianity has done for him. When it came time for the discussion part, the women formed one group, and the men broke off into another group and went to another room. After the discussion, everyone came together again, and some people left, and the rest remained until around 1.   I was very shy. I was too shy to even leave before everyone else did. I spent most of the time during the fellowship just watching and listening to people. They were talking a lot about a camping trip they had gone on the previous weekend, and how the guys had scared the girls by making bear noises. Subsequent times, I won't be staying very long after the discussion part; officially the meeting is supposed to end at 11 - that's when the church website says it ends.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming, good and decent. It's just a righteous, kind and caring atmosphere. There's something somewhat jarring about being among people who want to talk about God and Christianity, and want to talk openly about God and Christianity in a positive light - I'm very unaccustomed to that. It's a good kind of jarringness.  During the lecture, I had a view out into the backyard, where there was a dog, probably some kind of hound with short legs. I was very interested in and distracted by this dog the whole night, wanting to get my hands on him. He was hanging out on the stoop, wanting in, frequently looking into the house through the glass door and staring plaintively at all of us, and occasionally whining.  I'm told that my brother is scheduled to be shipped back to Iraq sometime in August. I hope somehow it turns out that he won't be going.

      The wedding was simple and quite lovely. The bride was beautiful and radiant in her flowing white dress, tears in her eyes as she walked down the aisle. The groom was handsome and beaming. For the majority of the ceremony, the preacher had his back to the audience, and the bride and groom were elevated on stairs and facing the preacher and facing the audience, so that the audience could see their faces; I liked that - that's something I want for my own wedding (someday hopefully). Also, the bride and groom wrote their own vows to each other - I want that too. It was overall a traditional church wedding, with a smattering of informality and unconventionality (e.g., without being disruptive, the jolly and playful and effusive groom liked to hoot and holler and make remarks during the ceremony, which would evoke a response from the audience, etc.).  Very devout Christians that they are, the bride and groom had saved their FIRST KISS for their wedding day. Meaning, they had never kissed each other on the mouth previous to the preacher saying, "You may now kiss the bride." Amazing.  The reception was very simple and short. It was just cake, punch, and sparkling apple cider for the toasts, at an old, drab, musty little hall. (I'm partial to the grandiose sort of wedding reception, with the posh venue, overabundance of food, loud music, etc.; that's what I want for my own wedding.) The bride and groom changed into jeans and left for Big Sur right afterwards (the bride didn't know that the groom was taking her to Big Sur - it was a surprise).  It was kind of a girls' weekend out for me, with the company of my friend (the bride's sister) and her friend, whom I like to think I can now call my friend too because we got along so famously. On the evening of the wedding, we went to a chain steakhouse that I'd never been to before called Tahoe Joe's, with relatives of my friend's. Great place, romantically dark inside, with a cowboy theme, lampshades made out of rawhide and painted with Native American-style prints. Like AJ Spurs, which I've been to once, in Marina, CA. I love fancy dim restaurants. I ordered a wonderful 6-oz. steak platter that had horseradish dip on the side. We went to church the next day and had lunch at a Thai restaurant, where I ordered a baked eggplant salad, which was delicious but smaller than I had expected.  When there are 3 girls alone together, the subject of menstruation will inevitably come up in conversation - the subject of menstruation is inevitably apropos. Just like those stupid commercials. I am proud to say that it's never I who initiates it.  Reached my ex's house in Monterey nearly 6 o'clock Sunday night. He introduced me to his cat Spike. She's a fat cat and a mean cat. She was beating him up and drawing blood from him. She was pummeling him and cutting him open as he kissed and caressed and embraced her - the story of my ex's life. He treated me to dinner at Chevy's in Salinas. I ordered shrimp-and-crab enchiladas and a lemonade. Fabulously good stuff. Chevy's has on display a flour tortilla-making machine, like a tortilla-making robot, that churns out the best tortillas, tortillas like no other, and you can serve them to yourself, and you can have as many as you want. After dinner, we went back to his house, and he made coffee. I left for Glendale after 9 o'clock, with four boxes of Girl Scout cookies that my ex gave me (I personally boycott Girl Scout cookies for certain reasons, but I wasn't the one who  bought them, so...), and arrived around 3 in the morning. I guess my ex and I are friends. I mean, I guess he doesn't dislike me so much after all. We seemed to enjoy each other. He indicated that he would like us to spend time together again. I would like to spend more time with him soon.  Over dinner, he asked me, "So, what do you do for fun?" I just found that very charming because it's something that complete strangers ask one another, and I do want us to get to know each other all over again. There's damage that can't be undone, but as much as possible, I want us to start all over again. He had bought himself tons of boxes of Girl Scout cookies over eBay - that's how much of a nerd he is. He buys such an extreme amount of Girl Scout cookies over friggen eBay that he can't take three steps in his house without tripping and falling over a box of Girl Scout cookies, so he has to give me four boxes to help relieve himself of the excess. And his nerdiness is a considerable part of what attracted me to him in the first place. I got free stuff out of his nerdiness, besides, like cookies, and computer troubleshooting and repair.  I told my co-worker and friend that I'm going to a Bible study tonight, and he cringed and said, "Are you serious??" He had the most disappointed look on his face. I told him not to worry, that I'll still be the same.

      Saw  The Village  with my friend/co-worker recently. I enjoyed it. It spoke to this fascination I used to have with the Amish. After the movie, we went to a deli in Studio City called Du-Par's. I love delis. I ordered eggs benedict florentine, which is basically eggs benedict but with spinach instead of ham. I don't have anything against ham (except for the dead pig thing) - I ordered florentine this time just for a change. Eggs benedict is one of my favorite dishes - if a place serves it, that's what I'm ordering.  Saw  The Human Stain  on DVD tonight (Sunday night), and I liked it. I liked it a lot. Hot guy, the guy who plays the young version of the main character. Or rather - hot guy, the young version of the main character. The name of the actor who plays him is Wentworth Miller. Looking forward to seeing him in movies more often. There's this scene where his character and a girl are about to fornicate, and his lips are approximately 1 millimeter away from hers, yet they're still not kissing, and they just hold that pose for a while before allowing their mouths to meet. I've seen that a lot in movies. Very sexy. I like it.  Rabid PC-ness is denounced in  The Human Stain , *and* the audience is supposed to sympathize with that denouncement, and that's refreshing. That denouncement isn't the focus of the movie, but it's refreshing nonetheless. I don't think I'd ever seen a movie in which rabid PC-ness is denounced, *and* the audience is supposed to sympathize with that denouncement. It's racial rabid PC-ness that's denounced in the movie, though, so there probably hasn't been a lot of fashionably hysterical outcry against the movie. Here's why: Most liberals are white. Corollarily, racial rabid PC-ness doesn't sit right with even most liberals. White liberals who agree with all other kinds of rabid PC-ness tend to sort of cry "Time out!" when it comes to racial rabid PC-ness. So, when some TV variety show puts on some Whitey caricature, even the most leftist white students at some leftist college are slightly discomfitted by it and probably gripe about it on some anything-goes message board on their campus intranet. I'm nominally a tad more moderate than conservative on the issue of race just because I enjoy it when racial rabid PC-ness gives white liberals a taste of their own medicine.  Saw  High Fidelity  on DVD last night, since I've been told several times that it's a must-see. I concede that the movie is good, because goodness is determined by popularity, as is morality, and the movie is popularly referred to as good; but I couldn't relate to or sympathize with any of the characters, so I didn't like it. I didn't like them. Their trials and tribulations were just too hip for me. I was agitated throughout much of the movie. I kind of liked Dick, the puny guy who worked at the record store, but then he fell for a character played by Sara Gilbert, and then I didn't like him so much. Barry, the other guy who worked at the record store, was somewhat amusing.  Went to my cousin's engagement celebration barbecue Saturday. Made me ponder what it's like to be loved by someone who's in love with me enough to want to marry me, and to be in love with him enough to want to marry him back.  Someone to be kind to, in between the dark and the light...  Nothing like The Eagles' "One of These Nights" as background music for my lusty and love-hungry pensiveness. Except for "You Look So Fine" by Garbage:   You look so fine, I want to break your heart and give you mine...  I'm not like all of the other girls, I can't take it like the other girls, I won't share it like the other girls...    And many other songs. In fact, I'm going to dedicate a post exclusively to a listing of songs that are suitable as background music for Vespera's lusty and love-hungry pensiveness, and I'll be adding entries as I come up with them.  At any rate, I'm not ready yet to either love or be loved again, if I ever was ready before, but I'm entitled to my ponderings and imaginings and fantasies and oglings in the interim.  My ex. One way or another, my unsolicited phone calls to him will eventually stop. The unsolicited greeting cards I mail him will eventually stop. His rare, knee-jerk courtesy return phone calls will eventually stop. One way or another. Until then, however...  My brother's leaving for Iraq on Saturday. On Friday, we're going to his house on the Camp Pendleton base, which is near San Diego, and sleeping over to spend time with him and see him off.

      From the song "One of These Nights" by The Eagles, 1975:  I've been searching for the daughter of the Devil himself. I've been searching for an angel in white. I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both, and I can feel her, but she's nowhere in sight.   Polo.

      Last Friday, my friend/co-worker asked me why I decided to start attending Bible study Friday nights - I guess it still bewilders and disappoints him. Part of my answer was that I like being around Christians, that I find them nice. He asked me, As opposed to Jews, Hindus, etc.? (He may not have said Hindus, but he cited various religious groups, and Jews were the first he mentioned.) I said, No - as opposed to the bad rap that Christians get in the media, etc. How come finding Christians nice has to be opposed to finding Jews, etc. nice? My friend is cool, though - a marvelous person by myriad accounts, and an equal-opportunity bigot.  Not too long ago, there was a series of public service announcements on TV in which a man, woman, or child was presented and portrayed as good and decent and every-day, and the man, woman, or child would then assert, "I am a Muslim." Apparently the point of the commercial, in light of recent terrorist events, was that the few don't define the many. Somehow I don't believe that Christians would receive such sympathy if the Christian Coalition were to fly planes into skyscrapers.  I've called off the search for a night-shift job, and I'm contemplating taking French classes at Pasadena City College. Ages ago, I took 4 semesters of French at Glendale Community College, one class per semester. I've always dreamt of becoming fluent. I watched  The Bourne Identity , starring Matt Damon, on DVD this past weekend, and I really liked how an assortment of different languages were spoken in that movie. I really like it when an assortment of different languages are spoken in a movie -  Kill Bill  is another example of such a movie. I also want to learn Tagalog - national language of the Philippines - but I haven't been able to find a place where classes are offered.  I really like the looks of Matt Damon, but I tend to be uninterested in seeing movies he's in. And when I'm uninterested in seeing a movie, I tend to be really, really uninterested.
