       This poem was written in 15 frantic minutes one night.&nbsp; I woke up upset and restless and the words just came.&nbsp; I remember writing it...with a pen light in one hand and a bic in the other...on the back of sermon notes from church that Sunday.     &nbsp;   Tears on the Pillowcase   Loneliness creeps into my heart  Like a whispered voice from within the dark.  The superficial smiles have faded away:  The wounds of my heart are open to poetic decay.  Tears should arrive in haste  Laying my fragile heart to waste.  Lying in the sullen quiet  The world around becomes dull and silent.  Missed laughter escapes in choked out breaths-  The rhythmic sobs resound like memories long repressed.  After the storm settles inside my soul,  The torrent of fear is impossible to control.  The darkness prevents all rays of light  But in my heart, love continues to fight.    Emily Renee Burson, 2000

       I wrote this poem during my Soph. year of college.&nbsp; I had been keeping a lot of myself (my struggles, my fears, my pain) inside.&nbsp; One night my friend Mike just basically forced me to tell him everything.&nbsp; It was the single most painful and impactful moment of that year and forever changed how I look at my life.     &nbsp;  Waiting...  In the darkness before the light I feel a warmth I'm too tired to fight. Between all the tears and smiles,  He has walked with me for many miles. The trials of life have taken hold Of the hidden passions of my soul. In the dreariness of the autumn's cold I still fight for ultimate control My God, I just don't understand; Why must life be so out of hand? Is the pain a path to happiness? Is my brokenness part of your plan? And I try my best to comprehend A love so much larger than my outstretched hands With patience I know he'll lead me to victory And show me my home in his glorious city. Until that time I'll continue to fight and lean on my Savior with all of my might. I don't want to make it all on my own; I will wait--my Father will lead me home.  Emily Renee Burson, 1999

       This was the beginning of a story. I wrote it sitting with my feet splashing in the 'mighty' Jordan after a photo-journalism lab one Friday morning. Not sure where I was going with it, or if any of it will change, but thought it was worth putting here for anyone who happens upon this site to read...      Children of the Light and Dark  Sometimes it's the light that truly frightens. It's a lot easier to hide when you're in the dark. No one knows where you are. No one knows how to find you. You are left alone. That is what it means to be in the dark. But, when you come into the light, suddenly everyone can see you. You are no longer just a shadow of yourself, you are real and tangible. People know when you hurt and when you're healthy. They know when the pain is too much to take and when your joy in unstoppable. You are no longer a cry in the dark, or the echo of laughter. Now you have a name. You have a face. You have responsibilities to other people, and to yourself.      Being a child of the dark allows you to learn things from your own perspective. The world only operates how you believe it to operate. Because it is so much harder to see in the dark, you rely on your heart and soul to guide you. When the light comes in, you realize how easy it is for your opinion and beliefs to be changed, based only on what you see. You do not have control over your eyes in the light. There is no such thing as selective vision. The world operates within its own specifically constructed paradigms.      Perhaps, as a child of the dark, this is when you are tested the most and when you are in the most pain. You have a culture you have created all on your own. The world's culture is shaped, well, by the world. There is a collective consciousness that dictates how things should be run for the "betterment of the world as a whole." Individuality is lost on the world stage. When you are in the dark, you are an individual. It is very likely that you are indeed the only person in the world, so there is no reason to hide your true self. Your every dream can come true, if you only believe in yourself. And, because you are in the dark, there is no reason not to believe.

       I wrote this poem as an 'assignment' for a small group I was in while in college. We were talking about the Psalms, and we were supposed to go home and write our own Psalm following the example of...psalm 71, I think. It was like 5 years ago, so that may not be quite right...      My Psalm   I’m anxious Lord! The days go by in quiet confusion. There’s turmoil in my spirit, Lord. Everything is fighting for my attention.  I want to be content, This is what You have for me. I want to be peaceful Let Your passion come and fill me.  Breathing deep, Your love engulfs me. I feel Your hand in all I do.  Hold me tight, Lord. Embrace me when I’m lonely. Take my hand, Lord. Lead me on the path that’s holy.  I want to live for You. I want to be Your child. I’m here and waiting, Restless though I am.  Take my life, take my fears; Take me, Lord, and make me Your.  Emily Renee Burson 1999

      Well, here we are. I'm not sure that letting my mind have free reign on the internet is   that   good of an idea, but here we go!  Not a lot to say at the moment.  I'm feeling a lot of peace, which is good, all things considered-can we say it's been a crazy, hectic week?  Well, it has...but, a thought to leave you with-- "If we lose this, we lose all." C.S. Lewis

      My church is reading through the entire Old Testament between August 17th and December 31st.  It seems like a huge goal, but I am plugging along at a reasonable pace...there is the option to purchase the OT on CD or casette and listen to it, but that is both expensive and I don't know that I would pay as much attention as I should listening in my car.  So, I am reading.  As of right now I'm mostly through Genesis.  I had a friend in college who called my attention to the very beginning..."Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters."    So many times in my life I have found myself in a place where I feel formless and empty; where life makes little or no sense and there is an opressive darkness over the deep dreams and desires of my life (the number one desire being to see Him, to follow Him, and to experience everything He has given me in this life). And then I am reminded, through song, through friends, through this verse, that even in that moment of darkness before creation exploded all around, God was there, hovering over the waters, promising that He is about to do something amazing.  And so I like to think, in my moments of darkness, God is hovering there, about to do something amazing.  And He has never failed me.    Right now, I am in a creation moment.  For awhile there had been this darkness, and then life exploded around me.  I see beauty and passion in my friends; I feel love and joy at the simple things; I watched the sun rise over the ocean and felt God painting a masterpiece just for me to see.  I stood at the edge of the Atlantic, the waves washing over my feet, and wondered aloud how people could not see God and how the world could so easily believe everything was left up to chance.  I heard a baby's laughter and saw the innocent love of a three year old who just became a big sister.  A friend got out of a job she hated and already found something else.  I have the honor of holding the hand of a man who has quickly come to mean something special to me.  I sat on a boat, talked about books, and realized that life is made up of moment after moment of grace.  And today I feel amazingly lucky and blessed!  "When I come to the edge of all the light I know and am about to step out into the darkness, faith is knowing that one of two things will happen; there will be something firm to stand on, or I will be taught how to fly."

      wow, it's been a long time since I've written anything here.  I think it probably has something to do with the suddenly frantic pace my life has been taking.  So much has been happening that I'm not even sure where to begin and where to put the words that make the most sense...and if what i'm thinking and feeling can ever really be portrayed by something as simple and archaic as language.  Words are amazing.  Words are my life.  And yet, right here, right now, I'm suddenly finding myself unable to find the perfect phrases to tell you, dear reader, what I feel.  There is a Leonard Sweet quote, though lengthy, that has haunted my waking thoughts these past few days.  Here it is:  “I am part of the Church of the Out-Of-Control; I’ve give up my control to God. I’ve jumped off the fence; I’ve stepped over the line. I’ve pulled out all the stops; I’m holding nothing back. There’s no turning back, looking around, slowing down, backing away, or shutting up. It’s a life against the odds, outside the box, over the wall, “Thy Will Be done…” I’m done playing by the rules, whether it’s Roberts Rules of Order or Miss Manner’s Rules of Etiquette or Martha Stewart’s Rules of Living or Merrill Lynch’s Money Minding/Botton-lining/Ladder climbing Rules of America’s Most Wanted.       “I am not here to please the dominant culture. I live to please my Lord and Savior. My spiritual taste buds have graduated from fizz and froth to Fire and Ice. Don’t give me that old-time religion. Don’t give me that new-time religion. Give me that all-time religion that is as hard as rock and as soft as snow.  “I’ve stopped trying to make life work, and started trying to make life sing. I’m finished with secondhand sensations; third-rate dreams; I can’t be bought by any personalities or perks, positions or prizes.  “I won’t give up, though I will give in…to openness of mind, humbleness of heart, and generosity of spirit. When shorthanded and hard-pressed, I will never again simply hang in there.  “I will stand in there; I will run in there; I will pray in there; I will sacrifice in there; I will endure in there-I will do everything in there but hang. I am organized religion’s best friend and worst nightmare.  “I won’t back down slow down, shut down, or let down until I’m preached out, teached out, healed out, hauled out of God’s mission in the world entrusted to member of the out-of-control. To unbind the confined, whether they’re downtrodden or the upscale the overlooked or the under-represented.  “My fundamental identity is a disciple of Jesus. And I won’t walk through history simply “in His steps” but will seek to travel more deeply in God’s Spirit.  “Until God comes again or calls me home, you can find me filling…not killing time so that one day God will pick me out in the line-up of the ages as one of God’s own. And then…it will be worth it all….to hear these words, the most precious words I can ever hear; “well done, thou good and faithful…Out-of-control disciple.”      ~Excerpted from Leonard Sweet, A Cup of Coffee at the Soul Café.  (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1998).  Pp 168-170.~   Isn't that amazing?  It's exactly what I've been trying to do, and the results have already started pouring in.  I am happy and have suddenly found myself in a relationship I was beginning to doubt would ever appear.  I feel God, I am blessed, I am loved, I am cherished.  I am real and I am His.  And, for the first time ever, I'm learning that that is enough...

      Thoughts for Friday Afternoon... (From Relevant) "Who are you?  What is it that you consistently love, dream of, and perhaps even pursue on some level or another withouth even maybe realizing that it might be the definitive calling on your life?  Life is too short, so do what you love--and, more importantly, do it for God, who you should love even more...Begin right where you are.  Don't wait for life to get better, more convenient, ideal or anything else of the sort.  That wouldn't require faith.  That would require   change   and change won't come without even the most basic of faith being put into action."  If this is so true, then why is it so hard?  People talk all the time about finding their passion, and I've struggled with it for so long!  what is it that's I'm passionate about?  What makes me pulse quicken and my heart beat?  What makes me ready to change the world and willing to do just that?  What makes me believe when it would be easier to doubt? What makes me fired up?  My writing?  My job? My friendships?  My faith?  I don't know, but I'm asking for the answer and I know it will be out there...and then I will know passion and I will know faith and I will know action.

      Can you believe it's Friday already? This week has been crazy.  Last night I had the honor of going up to Indianapolis and being at the airport when a friend of a close friend brought home her adopted baby from Bulgaria.  It was a truly magical moment for everyone involved.  I don't know Paige and Brett all that well, but the joy on their faces was obvious from half way across the airport!  Samuel's arrival has truly been a miracle.  It's funny how seeing other people joyful just has to rub off on you.  I cried and i don't even know them.  I'm not family.  I'm not really a friend.  But there I was, tears streaming down my face, lost in the wonder of the moment.  It was a truly beautiful thing, that's for sure.  But, it is a moment and a memory that I will cherish always.

      this says it all:  "You should see the stars tonight How they shimmer, shine so bright Against the black they look so white Coming down from such a height  You should see the moon in flight Cutting 'cross the misty night Softly dancing in sunshine Reflections of its light Reach me now You reach me now  And how could such a thing Shine its light on me and make everything  Beautiful again  And you should feel the sun in spring Coming out after a rain suddenly all is green sunshine on everything I can feel it now I feel you now  And you should hear the angels sing All gathered 'round their King More beautiful than you could dream I've been quietly listening You can hear 'em now I hear them now  And how could such a King Shine His light on me And make everything beautiful  And I want to shine i want to be light I want to tell you it'll be alright Yeah, I want to shine I want to fly Just to tell you now It'll be alright It'll be alright, yeah It'll be alright  'Cause I've got nothing of my own to give to you but this light that shines on me Shines on you And makes everything beautiful Beautiful again"  David Crowder, Stars (from Illuminate)

      Emmaus.    Amazing.  The weekend was splendidly amazing.  There just aren't enough words to make it make sense.  everyone needs to experience it-to feel the closest to God you will EVER feel this side of heaven.  To understand, without a doubt, the beauty and majesty and forever grace of God.  To really love and be loved.  To have total strangers pay 85 bucks a piece just to wash toliets and bleach shower curtains for you for three days.  To see people selflessly cook 3 meals a day for you, with nothing but smiles and love.  To meet 6 people that you are instantly closer than you have let yourself be to anyone.  To hear what it means to follow Christ and understand that His commands-to love and to let yourself be loved, will change the face of time.  To cry out in joy...to cry the joyful tears of your entire life that are without selfish ambition.  To have someone remind you that Christ is counting on you to share his message; and all you have to do in return is count on Christ.  To truly understand, you have to be there.  You have to experience it. Love it, cry, and be healed.  And you get to see God.  It's amazing.  You MUST do it.

      Tonight I leave for my Emmaus weekend.  I'll admit, I have NO idea what to expect.  It makes me really nervous, quite frankly, but I think it's a good kind of nervous-a what is going to happen, I know I'm going to be blown away, and I can't believe how big God is type of nervous. :)  We'll see.  I'm sure I will write about it when I get back.    In other news, I've started meeting with a group of people from church as part of a creativity team for our "postmodern" service,  urlLink  .  I think it's going to be a wonderful creative outlet and a chance for us to do some really great things to impact the 20-30 something generation that lives, learns, and works in Bloomington.  We have a lot of people right here at our doorstep that are just crying out for something to believe in, and we have exactly what they need.  This service is a great chance to reach those people in a way that is honest, open, and, more than anything else, God-oriented.  There's a great quote in the book "the Emerging Church" that sums up what I feel 629 can, should, and is about--  "We should be returning to a no-holds-barred approach to worship and teaching so that when we gather, there is no doubt we are in the presence of a Holy God.  I believe both believers and nonbelievers in this emerging culture are hungry for this.  It isn't about clever apologetics or careful exegetical and expository preaching or great worship bands.  It is about believers in Jesus falling to their knees in worship, truly taking their faith seriously, and even repenting publicly in prayer.  It is about the Spirit of God as an evident participant in our midst as the Holy Scriptures are read.  This is what people in this emerging culture are drawn to.  We no longer have to apologize for what we do. Explain ourselves and teach clearly, yes.  But apologize?  No longer.  Emerging generations are hungering to experience God in worship."

      Random emails to myself.  I wrote this to myself about a year ago, just to have it...now I share it with you :)   I don't know that this is an email that anyone will read, but it somehow  feels better to write it all out and just listen to the beautiful music  playing in my ears.  It's amazing to me how simply beautiful life can be  sometimes--how, amid the craziness and the busyness, there is a quiet  simplicity that reminds us how fragile life is, how short our time here is,  and just how much we should try and accomplish before the sun sets on an  another amazing moment in the history of God.  Dark and dreary as the world  sometimes is, there is an eerie silence that comes with understanding just  how gloriously insignificant and meaningful we all are.  There is a moment,  however fleeting, when we realize that all we have is this time and all we  can do is embrace the beauty of the world around us with the understanding  that when we close our eyes, all that is left is the memory.  i don't know that we ever really understand the significance of memories  until the immediate action is gone--when we are alone, we realize how much  we need people.  when we are scared, we realize how important a hug, a  touch, or a kiss really is.  When we feel like we have nothing left to give,  we realize we have everything at our fingertips, we just can't see it and  don't really believe it.  It is at this moment when we find the strength and courage to face the  world.  It is at this moment when the secret desires of our heart become the  very reasons we try and make life work.  It is when we realize how much love  there is in the world that we want nothing more than to give that love to  someone else.  It is when we realize we can do anything that we want to do  everything and nothing all at once.  It is when we're standing still that we  long to move.  It is when we are running crazy that we seek solitude.  It is  when we are scared that we find out just how much bravery is locked inside  our bones.  It is when we realize that love is all we need that we realize it's all  we've ever really known.  I don't seek to be profound; I don't long to immortalize the legacy of my  words for all time; it is only that at some moment I realized that the  million things going on in my heart were not being addressed and that the  truth was being stifled by my fear...

      thought this was appropriate for today.  "America- Chris Tomlin   Let your glory fly If my people will humbly pray Turn from sin and their wicked ways I will hear them and heal their land And show my glory and power again Lift your eyes up Look to the sky The Lord is coming, coming to America Can you feel the fire Can you see the wind Blowing through Coming to America again Go and tell them the blind will see The lame will walk and the slave is free Shout the news that the lost are saved In the name of Jesus the dead are raised"

      I wrote this last year, but thought I would post it today.  I was asked what I thought and what I remembered about 9/11 and what i felt:  “I had just returned from NYC a few days before.  I had stood in the very spot where the Towers were on fire.  I had taken pictures of the buildings and marveled at their magnificence.  Three days later, I was humbled and confused as our innocence and naiveté were crushed with a single act of hatred and violence.  I thought of all the statistics I had heard when I was there, I thought of the people I had met and the pride I had seen on the face of every New Yorker.  Part of me didn’t want to believe that it had really happened, but the proof was there.  I was at work, and we didn’t have access to a television, so a friend of mine in Texas was emailing me up-to-the-minute blurbs.  I remember the email where he said the 1st Tower had fallen.  I cried for all those lives that had been lost, I sat in silence for all those dreams that would never be fulfilled.  I wanted to be with my family, but they were far away.  I wanted to hug my mom and know that everyone I loved was okay.  When the plane crashed in Pennsylvania, my first thought was that the attacks were moving west.  Who would be next?  The magnitude of what had happened slowly began to sink in as my boss brought televisions into work and told us we were all free to go home if we wanted to be with our families.  I was part of a generation whose single concern was technology and making millions fast.  Now I was part of a generation that would always remember where they were on September 11, 2001.  I didn’t want to take my eyes away from the television or turn off the radio out of fear at what would happen while my back was turned.  I wanted to be surrounded by those I loved and make the tragedy make sense. ..”  This morning, for some reason, the events of two years ago were really bothering me.  I think last year I was still in shock; still a little unbelieving and scared and waiting for something to happen.  My roommate and I were talking last night.  I think one of the reasons that it is affecting me so much is that in some ways, it seems like people have started to forget.  I know I'm guilty of it.  We've quickly gone back to the self-centered, american-dream, me-only mentality that has so permeated our culture for so long.  When did we change from caring about others to caring only about ourselves?

      Okay, the insane amount of time between Blogs just has to stop.  My life is busy, sure, but it's not THAT busy.  I'm just a little lazy and a little less-than-motivated at the moment.  But, things in my life have been happening, one on top of the other. First, I want to post the partial entry from a blog i wrote a couple weeks ago, from AUGUST 24th, to be exact:  "My father died 7 years ago today.  To me, that's almost unbelievable.  Not only that he is dead, but that it has been that long.  It was the summer before my senior year of high school, and oh what a summer it was...i became a Christian, met my very first boyfriend, and lost my father.  all in about 2 1/2 weeks.  And i think every single one of those events still echoes in my daily life to varying degrees...."  and then I stopped writing that entry.  Life picked up and got busy again, and the thoughts and the moment and the feelings were quickly lost.  Plus, service was about to start and I needed to get down to the nursery.  So, that was that moment.  Since then life has kept happening!  To bring you up to date: last night we had a women's ministry event, FACE2FACE, at church.  It was awesome.  Claudia Mitchell, our women's ministry leader, spoke about Hannah's life, her story, and her makeover.  Hannah's prayer is pretty powerful.  Here's just the beginning:  "My heart rejoices in the Lord; in the Lord my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance.  There is no one holy like the Lord; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.  Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the Lord is a God who knows, and by him deed are weighed."  It's good to know that He knows, because I've just realized it's completely possible to be joyful and bewildered at the same time.  I just never knew until now how those two emotions could combine and manifest themselves.  It's a strange feeling.  My life is going really well.  I'm really happy, but at the same time, i can't shake this feeling that God is saying 'You just wait.  You think it's good now, wait until you see what I'm going to do..."  and I'm waiting.  There is a feeling at church.  We all feel it.  We know it's about to happen.  We just don't know what 'it' is really.  Strange, huh?

      Okay, so everyone in my office is sick.  I really don't want to get it, so I feel obligated to go purchase myself a germ-mask :)  Okay, I won't but I'm really tempted to do it.  I hate being sick and don't want to get this bug, even though I really don't know if there is a way I can avoid it...so, here's to the Vitamin C and hopes that it'll keep the icky bug away!!    election day is next week.  I finally found a breakdown of the candidates in the paper today, so now i can be an educated voter.  i believe in voting, but i also believe in being an educated voter, so i'm feeling a little better about that whole thing.  I guess I don't have a lot to say today.  Tim and I's three month anniversary is tomorrow.  Wow!  I can't believe it's been three months already-time is a strange thing.  In some ways it feels like we've been together for so much longer, but in other ways it seems like we just got together.  Neither one of them are bad feelings; it's just funny how I can feel both of those at one time!!

      Sometimes I forget how rare it is to actually be appreciated for what I do at work.  I think, because I work at a church, it's easy to forget that I work with people, who, by their very nature, are caring and like to let you know when you're doing a good job.  But, I remember what it was like to work at 1stBooks and I remember that that isn't always the case.  Today one of my bosses took me to lunch, just to let me know that he appreciates what I do here and that he enjoys working with me.  It is a very simple gesture, but one that, today, touched my heart.  So, Jeremy, thanks :)    This is week 2 of going to the Y.  i'm still excited and hope I see some changes soon.  Granted, the cheeseburger during the aforementioned lunch probably didn't help anything.  Ah well, what can you do? :)  Happy Monday, world!  The sun is shining on another day, even if it is getting colder and colder outside.  At least it's not snowing. Yet. :)

      It's Friday again.  I heard rumor that there were flurries in the forecast at one point for the next few days and I was angry.  However, there doesn't seem to be a mention of it this morning, so hopefully it was just a bad dream during the news last night.  Because let me tell you what I'm not ready for-snow.  Sure, i know it's coming, but let's face it--it's OCTOBER.  Cold, sure; bitter, okay...snow, NO.  As I've said before one of my favorite things about living in Southern Indiana is getting to really experience all the seasons, but that is only fun when the seasons come when they're supposed to come.  Like winter.  It's not officially winter until December 22 this year, so it would be nice if it wouldn't snow before then.  I know, the chances of that happening are pretty much nill, but still, it would be a nice change of pace, you know?  Granted, I really don't want it to snow well until March, though, so....take some lose some I guess.  I tired in vain today to get tickets to "the Blue Man Group" in Indy tonight.  I didn't know they were coming until this morning, but they're a trip. If you've never seen them, you really should check it out at some point.  I saw them when I went to visit my friend Annie when she was living in Boston 2 summers ago.  It was a strange, great, amazing experience.  They're political and they're funny and they do some crazy stuff, but it's totally worth it.  Kind of one of those out of body experiences, if you know what I mean. :)  But, there are no tickets, so I will have to find something more exciting down in Bloomington tonight.  Good luck with that one, Emmy. :)

      For those of you who didn't think it existed, and wondered if I was just crazy, I give you the lyrics to "Brush Your Teeth"  When you wake up in the morning at a quarter to one and you want to have a little fun You brush your teeth (cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha)  When you wake up in the morning at a quarter to two and you want to find something to do You brush your teeth (cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha)  When you wake up in the morning at a quarter to three Your mind starts humming "Tweedle-E-Dee" You brush your teeth (cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha)  When you wake up in the morning at a quarter to four and you think you hear a knock at the door You brush your teeth (cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha)  When you wake up in the morning at a quarter to five And you just can't wait to come alive You brush your teeth (cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha)  You brush your teeth (cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha)

      Happy Sunday!  It's about 10:30 and I am getting ready to call it a night and head to bed, but thought I would write a little here first and expound upon my weekend.  Saturday was a great day.  Tim and I went on a long drive all day--we were going to go to Brown County, but it is peak leaf season and that means there would be about a million people milling around the park, so we decided to just drive.  We ended up driving through a lot of Hoosier National Forest.  Let's see, we went from Bloomington to Bedford to Logottee (however it's spelled) to the dairy queen.  From there we went to West Baden Springs.  Have you been?  If not, you simply MUST go.  We toured the West Baden Springs Resort and Spa.  It's an amazing old building (I'll look for a URL and put it in here tomorrow) and grounds that were built on natural mineral springs (yeah, the stuff that smells like sulfer).  The hotel hasn't been active since 1929, and it is now part of the National Historial Society, which means that it's getting some money to make the necessary repairs, but still.  There is talk in Orange County of opening a Casino, which would mean money and jobs, but at what cost?  The good people of Orange county will vote on November 4th about the casino and the land-locked West Baden Springs Hotel may soon become part of living history.  I think it would be really amazing to see it in working order again, but am sure it would cost a fortune to stay there.  There is enough majesty and beauty there to make it a success.  The best part?  It's for sale.  It's true, for only 33 million dollars, YOU can own this piece of property!!    After touring the hotel, we went to Lake Patoka and then began the drive home.  We stopped again in Bedford for dinner and Tim saw something he considered rare-a man with a mullet.  Silly Tim, he hasn't spend a lot of time in Bedford, now has he? :)  Then it was home, a movie, and then I came back to my apartment and went to bed.  It seems so simple to describe it here, but it was another beautiful day in the brief history of Emily and Tim.  It's true, it's been 11 weeks already.  Such a short amount of time, yet so beautiful and amazing and so much has happened...so amazing.  A total change of subject:  I'll be in Costa Rica in about 6 weeks.  I'm excited and nervous--got a crazy email from my aunt about monkeys, the jungle and pickpockets...wow, this is going to be an adventure unlike any other. I hope I can find a computer down there to post blogs throughout the week.  I think I'll need it.  :)  In an effort to be a little more comfortable in a bathing suit, Rene and I joined the Y today.  Tomorrow is our first workout.  Should be an adventure. :)  Goodnight...

      I've been trying to write something for this site for a couple days now and just haven't really had anything to say...so, pardon me if this is nothing but rambling nothings... :)  Do you remember the old saying that children are meant to be seen and not heard?  I've always had a problem with that statement, but lately it's really bothered me.  I don't' know, maybe it's because I work in children's ministry and because I've always loved kids and loved being around kids, but who really thought that thought up????  and why did it catch on like it did?  So, on that note, here's a great quote...from a 7 year old...  "I believe in God, but I still wonder about a lot of things.  Like I wonder how He made eyeballs."  Joseph Langer  How true is that?  I know that I believe in God, but I still wonder about a lot of things, myself.  I wonder why friends hurt, I wonder why life is hard, I wonder why everything can't go right at once.  I wonder if I love Him enough, I wonder how I got so blessed, I wonder what people see when they look at me.  I hope the person they see is the person I am. I hope I am as genuine as I can be. I find it funny that the deeper my faith becomes, the more questions there are to ask. But, that is part of seeking him; that is part of experiencing life and experiencing this journey we are on, instead of just being here.  And that's one of the greatest things about being a kid, whether your a little one in 'reality' like Joseph or whether you're a kid like we all are; God's kids.  Kids aren't afraid to ask questions, they are naturally inquisitive, and they want to know what is going on in the world; what's more, they want to know WHY...the questions get a little harder, the older we get, but the longing to ask them stays.  Instead of why is the sky blue? we wonder...why do bad things happen to good people?  Instead of why does a dog bark? we wonder why do we say such hurtful things when in our hearts we are not hurtful beings?  Instead of why is that boy sad? we ask why am I sad, why am I lonely, why do I hurt?    And, just like we don't always have the answers for everything a seven-year-old asks, God doesn't always let us in on the plan.  The secret is to take comfort in the plan anyway....and know that He's already answered the hardest question of all...Why did you send Jesus to die for me?  Because I love you, that's why.  So, wonder away, dear children.  Ask God the hard questions and then relax knowing that He's got the details already worked out.  Why?  Because God is God and we are man...we only know one little piece in the puzzle of the universe.

      Okay, some days I feel like there are a million and a half reasons why I would rather live anywhere than Southern Indiana.  Take, for example, the 120% humidity in the summer.  Or the ice, ice, ice, snow, ice, mix in the winter; the fact that I live in a college town, yet do not attend college anymore.  The 45 minutes it sometimes takes me to drive the less than 10 miles to work in the morning.  The list could go on and on...but then, something happens and I realize exactly why I love this part of the world so much  --FALL happens.    Right now, the leaves are about every shade of red, orange, and brown you can imagine.  Not dying brown, but living brown--it's amazing.  Just glancing out the windows here at work and seeing the little I can see paints such a beautiful image in my head.  It's as if God, for just a few weeks every year, looks down on Southern Indiana and says "look what I can do!  It's amazing, it's beautiful, it's so much more than you ever thought possible.  To you, they're just leaves for 11 months a year, but then in just a few brief moments everything changes and it's a masterpiece of epic proportions."  It is moments like this that I am completely humbled to know that just like He paints each leaf on each tree, He is painting my life and making it a brilliant masterpiece.  Little ol' me!  And sometimes it's the bottom layers of the masterpiece that he works on - you know the ones, the ones where it's the foundation, but when the work is done, you can't really see them.  And I think that's when we feel God the most.  My friend Liz just got back from a worship conference and said some really amazing things about being in place and in peace with God.  Check it out  urlLink  Liz .

      It's funny how just a few hours can change your outlook.  I know it's a cop-out sometimes, but I know when my hormones are out of control and what that does to my body-it makes me really emotional...and then you throw in an extreme lack of sleep the last few days, and here we are.  But, luckily, I am dating a really understanding man who knows that when i'm really tired and really out of the loop, I sometimes say things that I don't mean, or have a hard time making sense of what I'm feeling.  So, now, I feel much better, but am to the stage of just missing the boy a lot, even though he just works upstairs (literally) from me.  I think this blog will become quite a bit of short blogs that are my current thoughts and ideas and feelings and not so much really deep, really difficult ideas that I'm wrestling with, if that makes sense. And since I have internet access most of the day, it's helpful.  I can log on and say what I'm feeling and log back off in just a matter of minutes.  Now, the really funny thing is that i think all of three people read this thing :)

      Open Mouth. Insert Foot.  This should be the theme of my life.  I think it deserves a place on honor on a T-shirt I wear, a bumper sticker on Ginny, and a mug from which I drink my coffee.  I have a sick tendency to not think things quite all the way through before I say them--and that can sometimes cause a whole slew of problems in my life, you know.  Maybe not huge, life-changing problems, but it makes me feel bad about myself and worry about what I say and do.  Last night was one of those times.  The only thing worse than the open mouth, insert foot mentality I have is the I don't know how to accept forgiveness mentality :)  Neither are healthy, I do believe :)

      Have you ever had one of those days where you have so much to say you're not sure where to begin?  i'm having one of those days today.  I feel kind of lost, but not in a bad way--in an "I like being lost because then I have to search to find the things to bring me out" kind of way.  I guess for awhile now I've been walking around with this assumption that I wasn't allowed to feel anything but happy.  And, don't get me wrong, I am happy--but that doesn't mean I can't have a bad day or that things can't bother me or that things can't make me want to cry- those are natural responses to life, right?  Life is hard and it isn't always perfect and there is always a quest for something more.  I think in the bliss of falling in love and finding someone who is basically PERFECT for me, I've forgotten that I'm still allowed to feel and hurt and dream and wonder and wander....that he is an amazingly important part of my life and a beautiful thing that brings me so much happiness, peace, and joy, but that there are other things in life, as well.  it's all so strange.  I feel like my life has been a ball of play-doh being squeezed out of that spaghetti contraption and now God is quietly molding all the pieces back together to make me whole.  I didn't know I was allowed to feel whole again.  it's a nice feeling.

      Today I got a fish.  A wonderful lady here at the church used it for a talk and then decided that she didn't want it anymore, so now it's sitting in it's little home on my desk.  Tonight I will take him home, get a 'real' tank for him, and let the water sit for a day before putting him in his new home.  He's a dark red beta.  very cute, actually.  i'm excited.  i love fish.  I would love to have a fish tank, but I really don't think we need one more thing in our apartment at the moment.  :)  Anyway, that's the new and exciting thing for today. It's been a very fishy week.  This weekend Tim and I went to the aquarium in Newport, KY.  It's really neat and one of those things that is actually worth the money :)  I had a great time!!!    it's monday morning and I have a feeling it's going to be a great week :)

      There is something about Friday.  It's so hard for me to get motivated, but at the same time I am so happy that the weekend is here...it's a strange feeling, that's for sure. Fridays at my job are always one of two things-either they are completely easy and i don't have a lot to do or they are so jam-packed I don't know how I will ever get everything done that needs to be done.  It's only 9:15, so i'm not sure how this one is going to turn out yet.  So far things have been pretty slow...so that could be a good sign :)   I am fighting my first cold of the season.  I do not like being sick at all, but I guess that's just what happens when you're up too late and you spend an entire weekend in the woods, even if you are inside.  The weekend was worth it, though, just as being up late at night to spend time with Tim is worth it.  Someone told me to take an insane amount of Vitamin C so I tried that this morning--we'll see what that much Vitamin C does to the stomach lining of a person. :)  Should be interesting...  Can you tell I'm having a hard time forming complete sentences?  we'll see what the combo of cold medicine and vitamin C do to a person...

      "I love you."    He whispered those words to me a week ago and sent my heart racing.  I never knew I could feel like this after such a short amount of time--I never knew that my heart would skip a beat when I caught a fleeting glimpse of him walking down the hall, on the way to one office or another.  I never knew that hearing him say my name would cause my breath to catch in my throat and a smile to dance across my face.  I never knew that an embrace could make every dark moment disappear into nothingness as we sit together, doing nothing, just enjoying being with each other.    I thought I had known love; I thought that I had understood the little things that make a relationship work, but I was wrong.  Relationships require work, they have all told me.  And, i'm sure they're right.  But work and being hard are too different things.  This relationship is not hard, it's amazingly easy, amazingly peaceful, amazing blessed.  I'm beginning to understand now.  I'm beginning to feel love in a way I never thought possible.  I'm beginning to believe in the unbelievable.  "I love you."    As of today, it has been 2 months.  A short amount of time, but at the same time, a telling journey.  We have spent a lot of time together and we have both felt the same kind of love.  Last night he said those three little words as he dropped me off at my apartment.  He looked right into my eyes, and I could see nothing but love, passion, and beauty.  I'm amazed and humbled and loved by a true treasure on earth.

      Today I am struck by authenticity.  Or maybe I should say I am struck by the desire to live an authentic life; to be authentic to those I love and to have their authentic selves become a part of who I am.  We spend so much of our lives in hiding.  We spend so much time pretending everything is fine and that we are survivors.  When was the last time you asked someone how they were doing and then really listened to their answer? My guess is it was longer ago than you thought.  Sometimes I'll admit, I ask the question, expecting the same simple "Fine, you?" answer...And when I actually find someone who wants to tell me how their day really is, I get annoyed, frustrated, confused...All of the above.  Don't these people realize I have things to do?  I have people to see and places to go and a list of things that need to get checked off?  And then it hits me...  ...These people, these people are the authentic ones.  They are the ones who are not afraid to love a little deeper, to trust a little more, to be a little more concerned with other people than they are with themselves.  And then I am humbled and I feel bad for trying to stifle their uniqueness and their ability and desire to seek out the world and truly live it.    I know so many times in my life I am inauthentic-I am fake.  I show people just enough of myself to make sure they like me, but not enough to let them understand me...And then, for reasons beyond my own comprehension, people slowly find their way in to my life.  Someone refuses to let 'fine' be a good enough answer and I suddenly have to tell them the truth; that sometimes I'm sad, that I get frustrated with my job and the way it taints my image of my Church, that I wonder if I am doing enough, that I have dreams and desires that are bigger and brighter and more far out there than even I believe is possible some days...that I am a bundle of paradoxes and that I am someone who loves deeply and believes in something bigger than myself.  My authentic self is nothing short of a bundle of paradoxes and riddles, nothing short of something straight out of a mystery novel.    To those that really know me, you know who you are.  Thank you for not settling for 'fine.'  To those who want to know me better, don't settle.   I promise to do the same for you.    Who are you really?  Please don't be afraid of yourself.  You are amazing and special and created for a reason.  You are loved and you are love.  There is no one else in the world who can do what you are here to do.  Be brave, dear friends.  Be brave.  Authenticity is scary, but being inauthentic should be even more terrifying!

      Well, elections are over.  It took all of four seconds to place my votes yesterday, but whatever.  I guess that's what happens when you have like 3 catagories to vote for...you just can't stare at 10 names for that long! :)    I realized something much more important yesterday.  I went to Hannah House/Crisis Pregnancy Center yesterday to deliver some stuff from our nursery at work, my house, and stuff that my small group purchased.  It wasn't much: some diapers, an old stroller, some blankets and pacifiers, and baby quilt, a travel 'health kit' for babies, some books for the moms and some stuffed animals--altogether, just some random stuff thrown together.  I walked into the house and was met by a little older lady who was knitting.  I said I had some stuff to donate and her eyes lit up.  And then she said two little words that completely floored me. "Bless you."  She and the other lady who came to help get the stuff out of my car were so excited to be receiving all this little stuff; stuff that was 'leftovers' in the nursery, stuff that was just little and simple and...completely unspecial.  But, for some reason, it made their day.  And, because it made them so happy, it made me so happy.  Maybe for the first time in my life, during a moment that wasn't Christmas or a birthday, I realized the importance of 'it's more blessed to give than receive.'    I leave for Costa Rica in 18 days. I have a lot to get done and pack and buy before then, but it should be fun.  I'm excited...a little nervous, but excited.    Okay, off to work...

       The Most Wonderful Time of the Year   It's almost Christmas and has taken me the better part of the month to really get into the Christmas spirit, but now it is here and I am ready and rarin' to go.  Yesterday will go down in history as one of my favorite days ever.  Can I tell you exactly how in love I am with a boy named Tim?  Can I tell you how his gift of perhaps the most beautiful necklace I have ever seen made my heart jump and made me feel like the most beautiful and special girl in the universe yesterday?  Can I tell you how much fun I had hanging out with him, even though the Colts lost the game and it was really late last night when we got home?  Can I tell you how his heart forever changed mine?  Can I tell you how happy I am?  Are there even words to make sense of the overflow of emotion in my heart?  So here is my promise to everyone seeking love--it  will  happen.  I am proof.  I never thought it would and the Christmas season especially reminded me of my lonliness and singleness, but here I am.  I get to spend this beautiful season with a man I am becoming more and more convinced everyday was meant for me. :)  So, if you are searching, be patient my loving friends.  God's best is so much better than anything you could dream up for yourself (even marry a famous Christian singer :) ).    So Merry Christmas to all...may your days be wonderful and bright, and may you find the love that you thought was just a dream.  May the beauty of the season shine on the people you love.

       gracious           marked by kindness and courtesy, marked by tact and delicacy, characterized by charm, good taste, generosity of spirit   I do not understand why people seem to lack a gracious heart.  Sure, we all have our moments where we are not kind and courteous, moments where our spirits are angry and frustrated and we seem to see only the bad things in life, but in our hearts, we are still gracious.  However, I believe there are some people that are only able to find their worth and their happiness by making the rest of the world seem inferior to their own 'perfection.'  These people hurt me, make me angry, and make me want to tell them just how frustrated I get with their better than everything attitude.  However, I know that it would do no good and I would become just another complaint for them to voice loudly to the entire world.  The louder it gets, the more I long for silence.  I long for quiet moments when the only thing I need to do is watch the snow fall and curl up under a blanket with a cup of hot cocoa.  Instead there is noise everywhere.  Loud people talking down the hall, the phones ringing, the sound of a woman talking to herself constantly...the sound of the humidifier and the copy machine and so much noise everywhere...  There is a part of me that just wants to scream, because I know the scream would drown out the rest of the noise.  And when I stopped screaming, for a moment, I would hear only silence.  But it would only take a moment and then the noise would return, and my complaint would be lost in the hum-drum of the everyday.

      Yes, it's cold outside.  Yes at least three people in my office are fighting the flu.  Yes I would rather be in my house sound asleep right now than watching to phones for the receptionist. As it is, though, there is nothing I can do about any of the above.  I can down the vitamin C and wear extra clothes, and try to get to bed at a reasonable time.  That's about it.  And those are the things I am doing.  Not a lot has happened since Monday at 8:41 a.m.  Tomorrow I am taking my car in because apparently there's an open recall on it-which means there is a 99% chance that the recall is why my lights are blinking like they are.  Whiche also means that it gets repaired for free.  YAY! :) That's a Merry Christmas present if there ever was one.  Since there is really nothing to do while watching the phones, I think I will play computer games now.  Good times!

      No Mistake About It  Winter has come to Southern Indiana.  The "light dusting to an inch" we were  supposed  to get Saturday turned into a solid 3+ by Sunday morning.  It's beautiful, I don't doubt that a bit...however, it's also cold and make the roads less that fun to drive on, which in turn makes me nervous and cranky.  I'm not really sure why or when my fear of snow kicked in full force.  I think it was after not driving in it for awhile; I simply just stopped trusting myself as much as I should, which is just silly.  I've only ever been driving in one accident, and that was not so much preventable.  When you're driving a glorified box of tin, crest a hill and see a deer on the road, what are you supposed to do?  So yeah, I made a pledge to myself this year to get over my fear of driving in the snow...and did...until it snowed. :)  I didn't drive in it this weekend, not so much because I was 'scared' to but because I just didn't have the need.  I was with Tim when it started, he took me home, and then we both had to be at the church at 6:45 a.m. on Sunday, so he just came and picked me up.  That was when the roads were the worst, that's for sure.  By the time we left church, the roads weren't nearly as bad, but then this morning...okay, so the roads were fine.  My apartment complex, however, was a sheet of ice.  a SCARY sheet of ice, to be exact. :)  AH well, what can you do?  In other news, my friend Annie is moving to Cape Cod one week from today. I cannot begin to tell you how sad this makes me.  She is an amazing girl and one of my dearest friends and I am going to miss her terribly.  Last night we got to spend some time together, which was really nice.  I know we're going to be friends for a long time, but the idea that she's not going to be just down the road from me.  I hoe she knows what she means to me and I hope she knows just how important her friendship is to me...she is one of a kind and I am blessed and honored to have her in my life.  Here's to you, Annie :)  Anytime you want to play Ptarmigan Ping Pong, I'm there!

      I think winter has finally come to Indiana. Too bad it's not really winter yet.  That isn't until what, December 21st or something like that?  But it is C-O-L-D outside today.  REALLY cold.  my feet are still frozen and I've been inside for quite awhile now.  Oh well, it's fine.  It's winter.  I've lived here my whole life, you think I would just be resigned to it, right?  Right, but I'm not. Every year I actually get a little more bitter and a little more dedicated to leaving it all behind.  Somehow I doubt I ever will, though.  My family is here, my friends are here, and the other three seasons are things I simply couldn't live without, so this one is just part of the deal, I guess.  I haven't mentioned anything about the adult Christmas musical that we had here at SOCC last weekend...and there's a reason for that.  I really don't know how to describe it.  I've seen a lot of 'church' presentations in my day, and I've seen a lot of musicals...but this one, wow.  It was so simple, so profound, and so moving.  It was called "Who Is This King of Glory?" There is a song by the group Third Day of almost the same title.  The first verse and Chorus are below:   Who is this King of Glory that persues me with his love And haunts me with each hearing of His softly spoken words My conscience, a reminder of forgiveness that I need Who is this King of Glory who offers it to me  His name is Jesus, precious Jesus The Lord Almighty, the King of my heart The King of glory   It was the story of a little girl and her grandfather and the true meaning of Christmas.  The musical was beautiful, hopeful, and holy.  There were goosebumps all over my body the whole way through it...and the real message--that two huge moments, the birth of Jesus in a manger and the death of Jesus on the cross were the bookends of the single greatest act of love in the history of history.  The finale of the show was a song called "Midnight Cry."  I cannot begin to explain in words how well it was done and how amazing the man who sang it was.  His name is Tim Birt and he's a vocal music major at IU. I think he's getting his master's at this point.  That's not what is so amazing, though.  What is amazing is that he is simply amazingly talented...and completely humble.  When the sanctuary erupted in applause at the end, he simply walked off stage.  Later we were talking and he said "my only hope and prayer was that they were cheering about the message, about the story, and about how amazing God is.  That is the only thing that matters."  It was amazing.  I only wish I could somehow put the WAV file of the song on my blog so you could understand just how amazing it was.  Here are the lyrics to the song:    I hear the sound of a mighty rushing wind And it’s closer now than it’s ever been I can almost hear the trumpet As Gabriel sounds the call At the midnight cry we’ll be going home  When Jesus steps out of the clouds to call His children The dead in Christ shall rise and meet Him in the air Then those that remain, will be quickly changed At the midnight cry, when Jesus comes again  I look around me I see prophecies fulfilled everyday And signs of the times they're appearing everywhere I can almost hear the Father as He says, "Son, go get my children" At the midnight cry the dead in Christ shall rise  When Jesus steps out of the clouds to call His children The dead in Christ shall rise and meet Him in the air Then those that remain, will be quickly changed At the midnight cry, when Jesus comes again  Then those that remain, will be quickly changed At the midnight cry, when Jesus comes again At the midnight cry, when Jesus comes again When Jesus comes again   Amen!

      Last night I did something I haven't done in a very long time.  I went to sleep at 11:00 and slept until 6:10 this morning-without waking up.  That NEVER happens to me.   After a long day yesterday, I was able to relax and just be quiet and still for awhile, which made it so much easier to go to sleep.  There is something about being in the arms of one you love, just talking, laughing, and joking about nothing and everything that makes life seem so much more complete.  I lost sight of something for a couple moments yesterday, and I think that's why I was so sad.  This quote sums it up:   The best things in life are nearest: Breath in your nostrils, light in your eyes, flowers at your feet, duties at your hand, the path of right just before you. Then do not grasp at the stars, but do life's plain, common work as it comes, certain that daily duties and daily bread are the sweetest things in life.  --Robert Louis Stevenson    It's so true, though.  The best things in life are the nearest, the closest to you-family, friends, the ones you love, the ones you cherish, the ones who cherish you.  My outlook this morning is much better; mostly because I have found a great peace in a simple fact.  God is real.  He is love.  And, most importantly, He is here. Right now.  In this place and in this little heart.  Even the cold blustery weather cannot change the fact that love is real and that warms my heart.  I changed the title of my blog.  It's one of my favorite quotes from a song in "Sleeping Beauty" and so true.  Our dreams are our wishes, they are both from God.   I love you all.

      Today the dark weather outside is clouding my mood. Why? I don't know.  It's like the littlest things are making me cry; the littlest things are making me angry and sad and frustrated and hurt and all of that at once.  i don' tknow how to make sense of all of that and how to actually make myself happy.  There is not a lot in my life for me to be unhappy about; not a lot for me to be sad or disappointed about.    I just got a promotion, I'm in love, I have a great family, great friends, and a great church.  I know God is there and that He is loving on me.  I know that I am unbelievably lucky, but yet, today...the tears just won't stop falling.  I just don't get it.   Life is a strange thing.

      Books You Must Read  Here's my reading list from Costa Rica   The Five People You Meet In Heaven  It's by Mitch Albom, who wrote  Tuesdays with Morrie , which is one of my favorite books.  This isn't a religious book at all, but instead about a man who dies and the five people he meets in heaven.  Turns out in this version of the afterlife, everyone has five people they meet in heaven that share how their lives and the life of the person that died intersected.  It's a great study on how we touch lives and brings home the realization that we never really realize who we are going to touch and how we are going to affect the life of another person.  It will make you think about your friends...and about the people you've never met who, through random circumstances, are different because of your life.   The Tale of Despereaux  It's a children's book, but a great one.  It's about a little mouse with huge ears who makes a huge mistake--he actually talks to and falls in love with the princess who lives in his castle!  For this he is banished to the dungeon, where the rats live, to be put to death.  The story of a mouse, a rat, a princess, a spool of thread, and a homely girl with dreams of being something more all combined together.  It's a quick read, but hilarious.  It often reminded me of  The Neverending Story  since the writer often addresses the reader directly and encourages them to keep thinking.   Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister  I cannot begin to tell you how much I adored this book.  I literally devoured it.  I had heard about it for quite awhile, but hadn't gotten around to reading it.  It was at the beach house, though, so I picked it up. It's the Cinderella story...kind of.   It's the story of a 'perfect' little girl named Clara who is kept in the house all the time and of two sisters and their mother who had to escape England for Holland after their father is killed.  The two girls would be the 'ugly stepsisters' in a traditional telling of the Cinderella story.  I was, quite frankly, amazed at this book.  The central theme is beauty--what is beauty, what is love, what is compassion?  What is real and what is just an illusion?  It is AMAZING. Stop reading this now.  Go to the bookstore or Library and pick it up.  Devour it.  Then let me know what you think.  I can't wait to read more from the author, Gregory Maguire!

      Bienvenidos a Costa Rica!    That is what the large mural on the other side of the customs and immigration office said in the airport last week.  We were finally in Costa Rica.  I've been waiting for this trip to occur for a long time, so finally being there was amazing.  The night before I had been a little sad.  Saying goodbye to Tim and knowing that I wouldn't get to see or talk to him on a daily basis for a week was a strange thing...at the same time, though, a wonderful adventure was awaiting me.  So here we were--my mom, grandmother, stepdad, little brother and I--all waiting in line to get stamps in our passports and venture into a country we had read and heard a lot about, but still did not know a lot...  The first night we stayed at a bed and breakfast called the Posada Mimosa.  It was right outside of San Jose and beautiful.  The people that owned the B&B had moved there from Canada and were enjoying their retirement.  There was a pool that overlooked the valley, cabins, flowers, dogs, a gated entry.  it was great.  We went to a little town called Grecia for dinner and ate arroz con pollo (chicken with rice) for dinner.  It was very good.  The way home, however, was a little tense.  It's pretty easy to get lost on the roads in Costa  Rica.  They're not really labeled, there are no signs for towns, etc.  We thought we were heading the right direction, but soon it became very apparent that we were lost.  In the dark.  On the side of a mountain.  In Costa Rica.  My mom finally made my uncle stop (he and my aunt had rented a 15 passenger diesel van for the trip) and she went into a little Soda (drink and snack shop) to ask directions.  We saw the gestures the lady, who didn't speak any english was making.  yeah, we were lost. :)  When mom got back into the car and got us turned around, we finally found our way home...then we could laugh.  Mom had asked the girl in the Soda where we were on the little hand-drawn map we had.  Her response?  No.  Not on the map. :)  But, we made it back. :)  Monday morning we got up and had breakfast...and then Cameron and I went swimming at 8 in the morning.  The sun was already hot and the water felt great.  Then it was back in the car to head to our final destination--Tamarindo Beach, Costa Rica.  5 hours later, we were there.  We found the house we had rented, Casa Rosa, and made ourselves comfortable.  Out the back door was the beach--sun, sand, and ocean water.  At night, the tide is almost in your backyard.  During the a.m. hours, it's up to 200 yards farther out to sea...very cool.  Cameron and I got up the next morning and went exploring on the exposed beach...we found a baby octupus, more crabs (big ones!) than you can imagine, and all sorts of sea life.  this is where you go if you want to find whole, beautiful shells (instead of the broken 1/2 ones you find in places like Florida!).  The best part, though, was that you would pick up the shells and there would still be a crab, snail, or something else living inside.  It was REALLY neat.  We spent the rest of the day walking to town (only 3/4 mile down the beach) and playing in the ocean.  Cameron and I got out the boogie boards and had a great time.  The sun would go down about 6:30 and we would be mostly in for the night.  I was in bed a little after 8-830 every night.  Howler monkeys lived in the trees outside of our house, so we got to see them, too!  The next day we took horses to the top of one of the mountains to look at Costa Rica.  Yeah, let me tell you--I am not a big fan of horses...and because of that, they're not big fans of me.  It is just the end of the rainy season in CR, which means the path we took to the top of the mountain was really wet and REALLY muddy in some spots.  There was one spot that my horse simply didn't want to go through--so instead she tried to make her own path through the woods and ran me into a tree.  i have bruises all up and down my left leg.  Big ones.  It hurt like crazy, but getting to the top and being able to see so much of the countryside was totally worth it!  The way back down, my horse got spooked at the same exact place, but we survived and made it through :)  What else?  Cameron and I learned to surf!  I'll admit he's much better than I, but it was still a lot of fun!!  The guy that taught us was the husband of the woman from who we were renting the house...very, very neat.  Cameron had the surf board turning and all of that--I managed to not fall off. :)  it's the little things, right?  It was a very relaxing trip.  Lots of walks to town, playing in the ocean, and enjoying ourselves and family time.  Thanksgiving dinner, however, was another story.   Now, you have to give the guy credit-Costa Rican people trying to make a traditional american dinner...but it was still questionable, at best....my favorite?  The cranberry sauce was part of the gravy.  And we can't forget the pumpkin Flan :)  Bless their hearts, though...they tried :)  Friday was a day in the car, complete with a horrible headache (diesel fumes and having to drive a standard transmission up and down the mountains) and a car accident that had traffic backed up for quite awhile up the side of one of the many mountains. We made it to San Jose, stayed in the Courtyard Marriott and made it home on time on Saturday.   All in all it was an excellent trip.  Good family time, relaxing.  Unfortunately I had to come back to the cold indiana winter. YUCK:)

       It's Cold.   I know there is nothing deep about that statement, but I would just like to point out the obvious for a moment.  You know it's cold when you get excited because the weatherbug in your toolbar now says that it's ZERO outside.  And that's up from -4 when I woke up.  I'll be honest, that's cold. :)  I'm trying really hard to not be so negative...we'll see what happens.  So far this morning, so good.  I've been thinking a lot about my Big Dream this week.  And it has inspired me to write more again.  So, I am going to write.  A lot.  I don't know how much of it I'll put on this blog and how much of it will be too personal to share, but I am willing to do my part in my Big Dream so that God can do His.    It's funny how much motivation has to do with your dreams.  I guess part of me has always just assumed that since I want to write, then I'll do it.  The reality is that it takes work and effort on my part to make the dream come true.  There is a quote from somewhere that says, "Sometimes it takes a little work to make a dream come true."  I don't remember who said it or even where I heard it, but I need to find it and put it on my computer, in my room, in my journal--everywhere.  Because it does take a little work to make dreams come true.  It is not just going to magically happen one day.  I know this.  You know this.  I think everyone knows this.  It's just the actual doing that is the hard part sometimes.  I was going to try and be all profound this morning, but there's just not a lot to be profound about at the moment.  I'm still 1/2 asleep and cold anyway :)  So, Happy Friday.  It's been a long, snowy, COLD week.  Let's hope the worst is over for now.

       The Dream Giver   During our staff devotion yesterday we talked about the book "The Dream Giver" by the Bruce Wilkinson.  Then we were given two quotes to ponder as we thought about what the Big Dream that God-The Dream Giver-has given each of us is and how we are pursuing it.  Here are the quotes:   "The Place where God calls you is the place where your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet."  -Frederick Buechner    "Don't ask yourself what the world needs.  Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive."  -Gil Bailie   So of course, the question now is where is my Big Dream?  Where does my deep gladness pour from?  What makes me come alive and feel, just feel all of the emotions and thoughts and senses possible?   What scares me the most is that I'm not sure anymore.  I don't know that I've ever really let myself explore the possibilities of my dreams.  I mean, sure, there were those things from my childhood--the First Woman President of the Moon, a paleontologist, a doctor, a teacher--but as I've grown, I am no longer sure what I long for and what really makes me come alive.  Is it writing?  I love to write.  Or at least I love to say that I love to write, but it is not often I actually sit down and put the proverbial pen to paper.  Why is that?  Part of it is fear.  I'm afraid of failing at my dream to write, but I am more afraid of succeeding in some ways.  Isn't that pathetic?  Why is it that success scares us?    There are a few people in my life that I absolutely adore.  Today I want to talk about Liz.  She is one of my best friends and probably the best friendship that came out of my college years.  She is intelligent, beautiful, and so many things that make me realize just how lucky I am to have her for a friend.  The thing that impresses me most day after day with Liz though is her passion.  I hope to live my life with that kind of passion, but know I fail everyday.  She knows what her Big Dream is.  She knows what she wants to do with her life and even though she is not doing it right now, she knows that it is there.  It almost consumes her thoughts and her life, but in a good way.  God never lets it stray far from her daily routine, as if He is saying "Don't forget this.  Don't give up on this.  I created you for THIS."  She wants to work in worship somehow...singing, working with worship together, writing a song/devotional...doing something to let the world know that her God is the most amazing thing in her life.  When I think of worship, I see her face.  She has held on to her Big Dream even though she doesn't know when she will actually realize it.  That is dedication to the Dream Giver and his Dream.  I know her well and know that her fear of failure and fear of success run along the same path as mine.  I know together, we will realize our Dream and live the life that the Dream Giver has planned for us.  In closing, I leave you with these song lyrics.  May they inspire you to live the Dream every moment...  "Hard as it seems Standing in  dreams   Where is the dreamer now   Wonder if I Wanted to try Would I remember how  I don't know the way to go from here But I know that I have made my choice  And this is where I stand Until He moves me on And I will listen to His voice  This the faith Patience to wait When there is nothing clear Nothing to see  Still we believe Jesus is very near I can not imagine what will come But I've already made my choice  And this is where I stand Until He moves me on And I will listen to His voice    Could it be that He is only waiting there to see If I will learn to love the dreams that He has dreamed for me    Can't imagine what the future holds But I've already made my choice And this is where I stand Until He moves me on  And I will listen to His voice" ~Twila Paris~

       Allow Me To Vent For A Moment...  I hate the snow.  I really do.   That is nothing new for those of you who know me, but I just thought I would take a moment and make it very clear.  Now, I guess I don't  HATE the snow as much as I hate driving in it, that's for sure.  But, do you know what I hate more than driving in the snow?  When people behind me in their stupid big SUV's and CEMENT MIXERS decide to get so close to my back bumper that I can't see their headlights.  That's close in perfect driving weather; it's STUPID on the sheet of ice that was the roads this morning.  Please hear me now, all SUV drivers...   Your stupid big car does NOT make you invincible!!!!   I know that may come as a shocker, but being in a big vehicle that may or may not have 4 wheel drive does not mean you can drive 50 through town on icy roads.  Maybe my 20-25 was a little slow, but it was about all I felt comfortable doing!  You are going to be the reason someone gets in an accident.  And you Mr. Cement Truck on South Walnut this morning...You're carrying like 10 tons of cement in the back of your truck.  If you hit my little Focus Wagon, you will crush it; you will probably kill me.  How do you feel about that?!?!  That's what I thought.  So yeah, just slow down and back your butt off my car.  Being less than a foot from me doesn't make me drive faster.  It makes me slow down, just to spite you.  I don't know about you, but I kind of enjoy arriving at my destination in one piece.  Call me old fashioned...    Anyway, sorry.  I've been in a bit of a less that super mood this morning with the stupid drivers I had to be on the road with during my snowy and icy trek across Bloomington.  You know you have to be at work too early when the plows haven't really been out yet...or they've been out only enough to scrape the snow and leave you driving on a nice ice rink.  Ah well, what can you do??!?!    However, you all should be proud of me because I actually drove myself to work the last two days.  Even if there is like 6-8 inches of snow out there right now and it's only 20 degrees outside.  Last winter I took the easy way out and let someone pick me up.  This winter I've sucked it up and did it myself.    yay!  Maybe I am growing up after all...but that is another blog entirely :)

       Entry 2   Okay, so Tuesday got away from me before I could write this entry, so here it is, just a little late.  The subject?     BIG FISH.  If you have not seen this movie, I highly suggest you stop what you're doing (including reading this blog) and go see it.  Find the first showing you can get into and see it.  You won't need popcorn or a drink, but I would suggest a box of kleenex.  No, it's not that sappy, I guess.  It's just powerful.  And when I see something like that, it makes me cry.  I don't know how long it has been since I've seen a movie that I am completely at a loss of words to try and describe.  It's the story of a father and son.  The son is trying to figure out his 'real' father since he has told nothing but stories his whole life.  Which stories are real?  Which are fake?  Where did his father really go when he went on his trips?  What really happened the day he was born?  It is a movie about love, family, dreams, and knowing that sometimes the truth is just a little bit stranger than fiction.  Maybe it's not all perfect, but it's all real to the father...it's just amazing.  I would see it again, just for the experience.  Tim Burton thinks just far enough outside of the norm to make it interesting and believable.  It isn't until the end that you realize just how important the stories are to father and son.    We should all live our lives with the passion the father displays in this film...with the imagination and the belief that the world is bigger, better, and more magical than we can dream...that even the tallest tales have some truth to them...

      There will be two blogs today, most likely.  I have two things I would like to talk about/reveal to you, dear reader.  Here is the first...  When I was home for Christmas, my mom and I were driving to Ft. Wayne to go to my grandmother's house.  She put this CD in the player:   Carol King, Tapestry.   It was produced the year I was born (1979) and I'll admit, I immediately thought "oh great."  But then she put it in.  EVERY song is amazing.  EVERY song.  The title song makes me want to cry and rejoice at the same time, and that is a strange and beautiful feeling.  Here are the lyrics:  "My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold A tapestry to feel and seem impossible to hold  Once amid the soft silver sadness in the sky There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide And a coat of many colors, yellow green on either side  He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go Once he reached for something golden hanging from a tree And his hand came down empty  Soon within my tapestry along the rutted road He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well  As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared A figure gray and ghostly beneath a flowing beard In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black Now my tapestry's unravelling; he's come to take me back He's come to take me back"  Can you feel the sadness and the joy when you read those lyrics?  Can you hear the beauty, can you see the story?  Why don't more people write songs like this anymore?  Why is it mostly rap and junk and all about the material world?  This song is, for lack of a better word, deep and moving.  Powerful.

      Okay, so it's been like a month since I've written anything on here.  Why you ask?  I don't have the foggiest idea.  It's been a fast month, what with Christmas (which was wonderful--you should see the necklace Tim got me!) and New Years (in Evansville with Tim and his family) and the beginning of the new year...I guess time has just gotten away from me.    Have you ever had one of those days (months, weeks, whatever) where you feel like you have a million things to say, but don't know how to make the words appear on paper?  That is where I'm at right now.  I know a lot of things have happened and I want to write about them all, but it somehow seems almost too personal to post here, which just doesn't make any sense at all, now does it?    I  could just write about fluff, right about something just so that there is something on here so I don't look like such a slacker...but what is the point in writing something just to write?  I've never been that way, which is probably why my novel will never get written! :)  So here we go: here is my attempt to write something meaningful and deep at 9:40 a.m. on a Sunday.  The world is a crazy, funny thing.  It seems like I spend so much time trying to just keep up with the minutes of my life as they tick by.  Have you ever really stopped to think and wonder--what do I have to show for my life?  What do I have to show for myself in the midst of everything else that is going on?  Have I really made a difference to anyone?  Have I really made an impact in anyone's life?  These are the questions that haunt me as I write.  My deepest desire in life is to make my love for others and my passion for my God known--but I feel that I fail so many times.  Has anyone really come to know my Christ better because of me?  Has anyone been really touched by who I am?  Has my life really made a difference?

       Let Me Be Honest  I am more than a little apprehensive about going to see  urlLink The Passion of the Christ  on Sunday.  I am going with my church, which will be good, but I am also very nervous about it.  Everyone I have talked to or had any sort of communication with about the movie has had such a...powerful...reaction, I just don't know how I am going to handle it.  These are people I look to, people I love, people I trust...and they are people that understand the depth of emotion I feel on a fairly regular basis.  I think  urlLink this  says it all.  My prayer as I go into this movie is that I am changed, that I am never the same again, that there is something so real and so powerful about what happens that it cannot be denied.  I find it very interesting that the ENTIRE country is talking about this movie.  People are passionate about the "Passion" one way or another.  I think it's great.  I think we shy away from honest discourse on Christianity quite often.  For some reason it reminds me of the West Wing...there was an episode about being willing to raise the level of public discourse in the country, no matter what the results...this is the quote:   "Listen up. Our ground game isn't working. We're going to put the ball in the air. If we're going to walk into walls, I want us running into 'em full speed. We're going to lose some of these battles. We might even lose the White House. But we're not going to be threatened by issues. We're going to put them front and center. We're going to raise the level of public debate in this country. And let that be our legacy."    I think it should be the legacy of every Christian to be willing to stand up and put the real issue--the deity of Christ and the promise of eternity--front and center.  That way, when we meet Him face to face, we will hear the words our very souls long to hear--"Well done, my good and faithful servant..."

       Unchallenged Faith Remains Unchanged.  This was the main point I took away from my Bible Study this afternoon.  We are currently doing the Beth Moore study  urlLink  Believing God .  The point of the study is that we believe  in  God, but we don't really believe Him.  We've done two of the video lessons and week of regular lessons.  And, to be honest, I already feel myself changing.  I feel like I'm very vulnerable this week, and now that I think about it, I think this study is part of the reason why.  There are so many verses swimming through my head right now and she is just passionate about her God and her love for Him.  I want to live my life with that kind of passion, but it is sometimes soo hard to do.  How does she do it everyday?....anyway...back to my first thought....  Part of me has always thought that if my faith were strong enough, if I was strong enough, then I would be fine.  My faith would grow without me having to walk through the fire.  I would be content with my faith and my God.  And, sure enough all of that has happened.  I have been "fine."  I have avoided the fire by avoiding some of the things I  thought  were pitfalls.  I was content with where I was and thought I knew a lot about God.  Then, with one statement, I realized just how flawed that thinking and that logic really is...sure, my faith has been "safe" but has it been authentic?  I don't think it has.  And the reality of that makes my heart break and my every fiber cry out to God.  If bending and breaking and shaking my faith is what it takes to make it grow, I'm willing....I'm not ready, but I'm willing.   I need to be around people that don't believe the same thing I believe, who have different standards and opinions...I want those people to help me grow.  The other side of the 'faith growing' coin is this:  I have been very blessed in my life.  I have a great family-a wonderful mother, an amazing step-father, a great younger brother-, I have a good, stable job where I can do things I care about and make what I feel like is a difference for the community and for the Kingdom, I have great friends and a beautiful, amazing, and absolutely breathtaking boyfriend.  I do not take these blessings for granted at all.  I know just how rare and special it is to be truly blessed in life.  For these things and a million more, I am forever grateful.  They have all helped grow and strengthen my faith.  When challenges and frustrations have arose, these blessings have been the glue to hold my meager faith-heart together.  Funny, now that I think about it, maybe the truer statement is this...   Unchallenged and "blind" faith remains unchanged.   If you are blind to the blessings and refuse the challenges, you can never grow.  Your faith will be stale and you will be lukewarm...

       The List   I wrote The List last night.  I wrote it before I left work so I would know what exactly I had to do when I got to work this morning.  I wrote it knowing I had a full day yesterday and the rest of the week promises to be the same.  I wrote it so I could be focused when I got to my desk this morning.  I wrote it.  Now I want to throw it away.  I honestly don't care about the list.  I don't care about the trivialize of my job to a check-off list.  I don't like that all of what I do can be put onto a yellow legal pad and then all the sudden, the list is scratched off and I'm supposed to feel some sort of sense of accomplishment...  ...but what have I accomplished?  My little brother, Cameron, gets his black belt in Karate on April 30th.  That's right.  4 days after he turns 13, he will be an official 1st degree black belt.  He's about my height  (5'5"ish), weighs about 80 pounds, probably...if that... and could kick your butt if he had to.  I'm impressed, I'll admit it.  I look back at what I had really accomplished by 13...uh, I had a pretty serious obsession with New Kids on the Block, I had a poem published in one of those silly anthologies...I made the cheerleading squad for basketball with 2 broken fingers and my hand in a cast...I learned that I hated cheerleading...I survived most of 7th grade, the year that will officially go down in history as being the worst year ever...I played the flute okay...I had a one-year-old little brother who was the coolest kid in the world already...yeah, I think Cameron is way ahead of me already.  Karate, he's musically gifted, he's so much smarter than I ever was...he's awesome and I love him...  ...and a completely different thought.  I feel so connected and disconnected to Him at the same time.  I feel like everyone else in the world has so much more faith than I...I feel like I fail God so many times and I don't understand why He looks at me with such love.   I don't understand His love and I don't understand His plan for me.  I don't know what He wants me to accomplish in my life, but I have a feeling it's something much bigger than could ever be written down on a yellow legal pad and then summarily checked off...I just pray that the feelings I have right now, as raw and emotional as they are, never leave.  I never want to hear excerpts from an interview on the radio and realize that the man they're interviewing has so much more faith and is so much more willing to do anything for it than I do...I want to be changed and remain changed...and then maybe my life will be an accomplishment.

       Wild Geese   by:  Mary Oliver   You do not have to be good. You do not have to walk on your knees For a hundred miles through the desert, repenting. You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves. Tell me about your despair, yours, and I will tell you mine. Meanwhile the world goes on. Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain are moving across the landscapes, over the prairies and the deep trees, the mountains and the rivers. Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clear blue air, are heading home again.   Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, the world offers itself to your imagination, calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting-- over and over announcing your place in the family of things.  ** Annie put this poem on my fridge one day and I found it again yesterday and read it.  It moved me.   How often do we really let the world offer its imagination to us?  How often do we embrace the beauty and diversity and the million little things in the world that make it our own?  How often do we focus on being good and our failures instead of embracing the fact that we are loved  in spite  of ourselves?  We belong.  We have a place here.  We have a Dream to live and a mission to embrace.  If our purpose was over, we would be home, not still on this earth.  So listen to the whisper of the Creator on the wind and be willing to truly live the life He has given you...with all of the pain and hurt, it is still a beautiful thing.

       Laughter  I am once again reminded just how important laughter is in life.  It is almost as important as air, as food, as the zillion gallons of water I drink in a week.  Laughter calms anger, changes grumpiness to joy, and just in general makes the world seem like such a better place.  I am so blessed in my life to be surrounded by people who make me laugh--and who understand my sense of humor and what I really find funny.  I spend so many of my days and nights with the people that are important to me--Tim, Rene, Liz, Annie--sometimes it's in person, sometimes it's the phone, a card, or an email...but no matter what, these people get me.  They laugh heartily at my jokes (and my stupidity and speaking errors).  They find the same movies, situations, and ideas humorous.  They know that sarcasm is a gift that just not everyone has and they know that some people are never, never, never-EVER going to get it.    It is when I am with these people that I am reminded of the simplicity and beauty of laughter.  from the gut or simply a chuckle, it makes a huge difference.  Most of the time, we laugh at inside jokes.  There is only one other person in the world who finds "MAPS!" hilarious-and that is Phil Coleman.  No one really understands "Hello, Mr. Futon" or "PILAF!" if you weren't there.  I laugh at Ptarmigans and I laugh at the humor only two middle school girls can find in "Roadapples."  "ATT" and "Vag Anti-Fun" are only funny to a couple people.  There is something wonderful about inside jokes and things that make people look at you laughing and say I want to know what's so funny...you tell them and they look at you like you're insane.  Sometimes that is the best feeling in the world.  So thank you, my dear friends, for getting it.  For getting me.  For laughter, love, and knowing that the tears I cry with you are often out of joy and not sadness.  You make my life so amazing.

       This Road   Alone, cold, and frightened I wandered in the night; Looking everywhere and anywhere  for a little of Your light.  Yet this life I live is not my own, it is only Yours And this path You have me on- Well I'm sure I've been here before.  I've walked this road a million times before It's never changing, never moving. The same old sidewalk and that same old crack, They're never mended, always broken. I'm restless and lonely; I'm wandering aimlessly And seeking Your love.  You said to love with all my heart With all my soul, with all my mind. You said to give everything to You and to let You have all control.  But I'm tired of walking all alone In the footsteps of my solitary soul. I'm trying to let it go; To let You love have all control.  But I've walked this road a million times before It's never changing, never moving.   The same old sidewalk and the same old cracks, They're never mended, always broken. I'm restless and lonely; I'm wandering aimslessly and seeking Your love.  I'm trying to run to Your outstretched arms When the fear is too much to fight, But I've relied on myself for so very long I've learned to find solace in the night.  And in my separate silence That's when I hear your calming voice. And when I want to run to You My lonely heart is justified  And each day is a new tomorrow It's always changing, always moving. And one day I'll know no more sorrow; I'll be mended, no longer broken. My restless heart and lonely life WIll be at a wonderful perfect peace When I'm constantly seeking Your love.   ~Emily R. Burson, Fall 1999

       Humbled   Today I am humbled by how much I am loved and cared for and taken care of in this world.  Sometimes I get so caught up in the moment that I forget the one basic truth in life:  GOD will take care of me.  He will provide.  He  always  has and he  always  will.  Why is that so easy to forget sometimes?  I think it's because people try so hard to keep us in that state of near-panic.  We want, we need, we survive on barely making it from one moment to the next.  We choose to live this way instead of in the calm and powerful presence of the One who has promised to take care of us and love us and cherish us and always provide for us.     "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord.  "Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.  Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.  You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.  I will be found by you, " declares the LORD.   Jeremiah 29:11-14a  This verse needs to become the first thing I think of every morning and the last thing I think of every evening.  It needs to be the calm in the center of the storm of life.  It needs to be a powerful reminder of my Savior and His love.    I must remember.  I must take a break.  I must calm down.  I must breathe in deep.

       Back Again   Well, there is a good reason that I haven’t blogged for awhile—I’ve been in Honduras.  That’s right.  Central America.  On a mission trip.  It was amazing.  The hardest thing about coming back from a trip like that is the “How was the trip?” question.  It’s the best question, and one that deserves a real answer, but it’s still sooo hard.  The easy answer?  It was great.  Amazing.  Unbelievable.  Brilliant.  Eye-Opening.  I haven’t really ever been surrounded by that kind of poverty.  I also have never really felt the things I felt on the trip.  There I was, sitting in a country that just a few years ago was devastated by Hurricane Mitch.  We’re talking devastated.  And now you wouldn’t know unless you were told.  These are people that have next to nothing materially, but have everything you could ever want in their hearts.  They are happy people.  They don’t need all of the things we THINK we need~the stuff.  So many people live in houses made of nothing more than sticks and cardboard that aren’t even the size of the room I am in right now as I am writing this.  Big families or small, it doesn’t matter.  And yet, they are happy and they were excited to see us and wanted to share their lives with us.    It was so beautiful.  We did a little of everything.  I think the thing that impacted me most was the eye clinics.  Before I left my friend Karen sent me an email talking about the deep truth of giving people sight so that they can really See.  It was amazing how many people wanted glasses so that they could read their Bibles.  They wanted to read the Bible, and they couldn’t.  They wanted to see His words and hear His truth, and we could help with that.  There was a woman in a wheelchair.  I hadn’t really talked to her the whole day she was there.  Then I was walking into the room where we were giving out the glasses and she reached out and grabbed my hand.  Now, I didn’t understand much of what she had said to me, but I understood enough to know how grateful she was.  She told me we (the team) were all gifts from God and we were treasures to her.  I leaned down and gave her a hug and I could feel the warmth and strength in her frail arms.    She was beautiful.  The team I went with was amazing.  We were all very different and there were a lot of personalities in the room.  But, at the end of the day, we all worked together and made sense of our lives together for the eleven days we were together.  Paige, Renee, Kim, Kara, Whitney, Megan, Nikki, Gail, Stephanie, Laura, Tim, Joel, Brad, Kevin, Doug, and Al…  You are beautiful.  The whole time I was in Honduras, I could feel the prayers of the people back home.  I could hear my prayers as they went up to Him.  I prayed a lot and found a lot of peace.  And in return,  I could hear God whispering in my heart.  I could hear Him saying “I am so proud of you.  I love you.”  To hear that and to really believe it was amazing.  He is beautiful.

       Surely this man was the Son of God!  After Tim and I talked about the movie a little more last night, we both agreed on one thing.  One of the most powerful 'lines' was omitted.  As Jesus dies on the cross, the Bible says this...   And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, 'Surely this man was the Son of God.' (Mark 15:39 NIV)   Of the many people Christ encountered on the road to Calvary, of those at the crucifixion, of those that are a part of this story, this man stands out in my mind (as does the criminal on the cross).  This soldier had beaten Christ's body, had spit on him, leered at him, and hated him.  He watched as he was crucified.  He probably drove the nails and forced the crown of thorns on his head.  And then there he was, standing on the brink of eternity.  The ground shook, the curtain was torn, the Holy of Holies was opened, and everything changed.  He looked at the lifeless body of Christ and realized the Truth...  ...It wasn't until after the movie that I realized the omission.  It wasn't until I was able to process and talk about it a little more that the realization came.  Why was this left out?  Sure it's just one verse, but how powerful.  To be the tormenter...to be the villain, and to realize that you just crucified the Christ...wow.  I can't imagine what was going through that man's head.  He is there.  He knows.  Did he repent?  Did he believe?  Will we see him in heaven?  So many questions...   urlLink Go here  to learn more about the imagery, symbolism, and more from "The Passion of the Christ."

       I Will Never Be the Same Again  Well, I did it.  I saw the  urlLink Movie  and I don't think I will ever be the same again.  This will probably be the shortest blog about the most significant thing because I just don't think words can do it justice.  I really don't.  I don't think there is anything that will make this make sense to me.  I will never understand the anger, the frustration, the brutality.  I will never forget the sounds of an angry crowd crying "Crucify Him!"  I will never forget the continual, seemingly never-ending walk to the hill.  I will never forget the look of someone who knows what they are seeing.  I will never forget His impassioned plea "Father Forgive them, for they don't know what they are doing."    I could feel my life ripping into his flesh.  I could feel my anger, my sin, my lust, my pride...all of it...tearing through living flesh and exposing bone.  I could see in His eyes the love he has for me.  The way He was willing to do it; the pain He was willing to endure.  I would have refused.  I would have listened to the Temptress as she said it wasn't worth it.  His resolve, His love, His compassion.  There He was, hanging, bruised, and beaten on a cross, and He listened to the cry of a convict hanging beside Him and offered a powerful promise.  "I tell you this day you will be with me in paradise."    I saw this movie with two of the most important people in the whole world, my roommate and my boyfriend.  I sat in the middle of them, tears streaming down my face, as the Truth unfolded in front of my very eyes.  Rene didn't pass out, she watched with her hoodie covering her mouth, hiding her tears.  She sat silent and watched with open eyes.  Tim sat still at first, then slowly began sinking into his chair, tears streaming down his face, as well.  I could feel the haggard breath of a person muffling their tears as he watched.  I could feel his grip tighten on my hand.  I will be forever grateful that I experienced this film (for it is something you experience, not something you just watch) with him.  It is no secret that I love him.  That his very presence in my life is one of the biggest blessings I ever have been given...it is no secret that I dream of spending my life wrapped in the safety of his arms, and it is no secret that I truly believe it will happen.  And somehow, during this movie, I grew even closer to him.  No words were said, no words were needed.  He is the love of my earthly heart, second only to the One who blessed us with this relationship from the beginning.  I will never be the same again.  I will never forget.  Communion will never be just part of my Sunday morning ritual.    I do believe, I do believe In the promise of His love I do believe, I do believe in His kingdom come  I do believe, I do believe He promises me more I do believe, I do believe than this world has in store  I do believe, I do believe that love will overcome I do believe, I do believe In the One sent from above  I do believe, I do believe I am forever changed I do believe, I do believe My heart is no longer in chains

      Let's see...what has happened since last time I wrote?  I turned 25.  Scary.  Okay, so it's not scary, but it's pretty dang grown up all of the sudden.  It seems like just days ago I was graduating high school and starting college; now my little brother is a teenager!  It's hard to believe.  I think back at my childhood and where I thought I would be when I turned 25...and I've realized it's possible to feel very young and very old at the same time.  Old because I'm a quarter of a century old.  Young because 25 just isn't that old at all.  Nevertheless it's a strange thing.    Cameron is getting his black belt in Karate tomorrow.  It's exciting.  He's going to get a sword and break some boards.  I'm excited for him.  I'm also taking tim home to hang out with my family.  it's very exciting, but somewhat surreal at the same time. :)    AH well.  I'm suddenly completely unable to write and form coherent sentences...so off to bed I go!!

      This is the first song Tim and I danced to.  We were having a conversation about how we didn't have a "song."     Sway, by Bic Runga    Don't stray, don't ever go away I should be much too smart for this You know it gets the better of me Sometimes, when you and I collide I fall into an ocean of you, pull me out in time Don't let me drown, let me down I say it's all because of you  And here I go, losing my control I'm practising your name so I can say it to your face It doesn't seem right, to look you in the eye Let all the things you mean to me Come tumbling out my mouth Indeed it's time to tell you why I say it's infintely true   CHORUS: Say you'll stay, don't come and go Like you do Sway my way, yeah I need to know All about you   And there's no cure, and no way to be sure Why everything's turned inside out Instilling so much doubt It makes me so tired - I feel so uninspired My head is battling with my heart My logic has been torn apart And now it all turns sour Come sweeten every afternoon   CHORUS TWICE   It's all because of you It's all because of you   Now it all turns sour, come sweeten every afternoon It's time to tell you why, I say it's infinitely true   CHORUS TWICE   It's all because of you It's all because of you It's all because of you

      I heard this song on the radio and it made me think of my friend Mike Dodd.  We haven't talked in quite awhile, but this song still rings true.  Thanks, mike, for all you've done.  You changed me more than you'll ever know!   More Than You'll Ever Know  from "All Things New" Watermark written by Nathan & Christy Nockels    Somethin' brought you to my mind today I thought about the funny ways you make me laugh And yet I feel like it's okay to cry with you Somethin' about just being with you When I leave I feel like I've been near God And that's the way it ought to be  'Cause you been more than a friend to me You fight off my enemies 'Cause you've spoken truth over my life And you'll never know what it means to me Just to know you've been on your knees for me Oh, you have blessed my life  More than you'll ever know More than you'll ever know  You had faith, when I had none You prayed God would bring me a brand new song When I didn't think I could find the strength to sing And all the while I'm hoping that I'll Do the kind of praying for you that you've done for me And that's the way it ought to be  'Cause you been more than a friend to me You fight off my enemies 'Cause you've spoken truth over my life And you'll never know what it means to me Just to know you've been on your knees for me Oh, you have blessed my life  More than you'll ever know More than you'll ever know  You've carried me You've taken upon a burden that wasn't your own And may the blessing return to you... A hundredfold, oh yeah... A hundredfold, oh yeah...

       here for You  This is the new  urlLink CD  that the worship ministry (aka-my friends) at my church has put together.  I absolutely LOVE this CD.  The title song,  here for You  is one of the many recent anthems of my life.  Here are the lyrics:  “I’ve come to serve, not to be served,  give not to get All for the One who makes me sing  I want to place Him before my selfish ambition To become an offering  So I’ll worship Him not because I seek His blessing Who am I to be this way?  And I will sacrifice not to gain or hold His favor Just because I want to say  I’m here to love and adore Him Lay my life before Him  All for Jesus Christ my King”  It was written by Phil Coleman, a good friend, and I just adore it.  I am working on a CD of songs about my trip to Honduras...guess which one is at the top of the list?  This is what I have written about the song:  I’ve come to serve, not to be served…  Why do we go into mission trips thinking they are even remotely about us?  It’s so easy to pray about what we’ll get out of the trip, how it will change US…but the reality is that it doesn’t have a single thing to do with what we think we should get out of it…and all it took was the very first line of this song to remind me of that.  I am on this trip, I am in this country, I am stepping out of my comfort zone simply because I have been set apart by Him and he has told me to go.  If God Himself can come to serve people instead of being served by them, then who am I to think that I am better than God?    Our world and our culture are so consumed by what we WANT and what we think is best for us.  Everything around us says that ‘more’ is the answer, not less.  How can we get more out of our lives, what can other people do for us?   It really is all about ‘us’ if we listen to the world.  It’s that look out for number one mentality…and then I listen to this song and I think deep and hard about the scriptures from which it comes…and I realize, I’ve come (I’ve been brought into this world, into this place, for a time such as this) to serve, not to be served...  ...give not to get…  Oh that my life could be such a deep offering to Him and to those He loves!  I have never been surrounded by this kind of poverty, by this kind of need, and this kind of…love.  In serving these beautiful souls, in giving everything I can to them, we have been lucky enough to get something, although we don’t deserve.  Standing on this mountaintop, looking out over the city, there is nothing but beauty and tears in my heart.  What I thought I could give has turned out to be just a fraction of what He knows I can give…Father, help me to live these words!!!  Help me to give to You and Yours every piece of me.  Take away my need to receive something out of this trip and fill me with the dream to give it all up for you!  …I want to place You before my selfish ambition to become an offering…  This song is on repeat in my heart.  I wake up singing it; it is the last thought on my mind before I fall asleep, exhausted from another day.  Every time I start to think about myself and my needs, it pops back into my head…it’s as if God is using this little song, written by a friend, to remind me of His plans for my life.  If the message of Christ can be boiled down to something as simple as “love one another and love God” this song is a powerful way of making that a reality.  By loving Him, we serve, we give, and we place Him before ourselves and our dreams for our lives.  We place Him before our need to be the best, the smartest, the prettiest, and the most famous.  We place His world before our little one and we give everything, even our lives, for Him.  This song is the simple way of saying “this is what God says—Love Me, love those I love, deny yourself and I will lift you up.”    …So I’ll worship You, not because I seek Your blessing…who am I to be this way?...  Who am I but one person living one day in one place.  Father, rid me of the worldly need to get something out of my relationship with You.  My very reason for life and for worshiping You is not so that I walk away feeling fulfilled and good about me…it is completely about You and that You are worthy.  Help my world to revolve around You, not myself.  Perhaps the most poignant line in this entire song for me is the simple question—“Who am I to be this way?”  You were willing to bleed and die on a cross for me.  You endured everything, and I sit around whining because I didn’t sleep well or because I don’t like what I’m eating or because my muscles hurt.  WHO AM I TO BE THIS WAY?  You deserve so much more than what I give you, but you still accept my meager moments of complete surrender---and you remember those moments.  You forget the pain and tears I put you through and you hold on to that moment, maybe only one in my whole life, when I give you everything.  Why do I not live my entire life like that?  Why am I afraid of surrendering everything to You?  Why am I afraid to live a life worthy of Your love?  …I’m here to Love and Adore You, lay my life before You…  Let this song echo in my heart.  Let not another day pass when this song, which has touched me and moved me like no other, is forgotten.  Father, I may not know about tomorrow, I may not know what will happen when I close this journal and go back to my ‘normal’ life, but this I do know:  “I am here to love you and adore you.  Lay my life before you.  All for Jesus Christ, my King!”

      Has it really been that long since I've written anything here?  I guess it has...so here you go, dear readers!  Post mission trip life has been nothing if not chaotic.  I have lived the last month as a bundle of raw nerves, ready to explode or breakdown at any given moment.  The first worship service back from the trip was an emotional rollercoaster for me.  I cried my way through the hour of service, and then wanted to do nothing more than withdraw into my own little shell.  But, that was impossible.    See, I work at a  urlLink church.   And last sunday was Easter.  There are few things in the world like experiencing Easter from the other side at a church with over 3,000 people.  For two weeks straight the people I am closest to here built a Bridge, worked on graphics and music, decorated, planned, and made sure that the real meaning of the Resurrection was not lost in the shuffle.  It was amazing to watch, but hard at the same time.    As much as I hate it, I think I am going through a needy stage in my life.  I want nothing more than to be close to the people I love the most.  I want to touch them, to laugh with them, to be held by them.  I want to cry for no reason at all and I want to laugh because it feels good to do so.  I want someone to play with my hair until I fall asleep.  I want to breathe the same air of the people I love.  I want to feel them near me.  I want their energy to be my energy.    The last two weeks have made that almost impossible.  The people I love at work were consumed by the events leading up to Easter.  Tim worked until midnight or 1 every night.  My roommate has enough on her plate without having to worry about me.   Liz is in Indy.  I don't know why I feel this way right now, but I know I don't like it at all.  It's a strange feeling.  I want to be with them, but I don't really want to have to talk.  I want to feel their love near me, but I do not want to have to explain myself.   I want them to just understand.

      Sometimes something happens and you don't know how to put into words the experience.  Sometimes it's good...and sometimes it's bad.  this time, it was of the bad variety.    On wednesday evening, Tim and I were going to KFC for dinner.  We were stopped at a stoplight, sitting behind the stop-line and minding our own business. Suddenly there is an accident in the intersection in front of us.  A 2000 Chevy Tracker tries to turn left in front of an 83 cadillac.  The cadillac hits the Tracker and sends it spinning...right into tim and I.  Yeah, instead of it just colliding with Tim's Grand Prix and bouncing away, the tracker somehow gets airborne enough to end up on the top of Tim's hood and goes crashing into his windshield.  Crack.  Crack.  Crack.  Here comes a tracker through the windshield.  Then it stopped it's momentum and fell on it's side.  I'll be honest with you, dear reader...I was terrified to look over at Tim, the man I love.  I was afraid of what I would see.  I was afraid he would be there, bloody and unconscious.  Instead, he looked over at me wild eyed and made sure I was okay.  We crawled out the door and made sure everyone was okay.  Amazingly, there were no real injuries.  Tim had a couple scratches on his hands from the glass everywhere, but other than that, everyone seemed fine.  It's a strange thing to be in an accident and not know at all what happened or really what to do next.  We were just sitting there.  IF there was ever a person not responsible for an accident, it would be Tim in this accident.  So right now we're playing the waiting game.  His car is either at the tow place (Extreme towing in bloomington) or at Wilson's body shop.  Either way, we're not sure yet whether or not it's going to be totaled out.  I hope not.  I know Tim hopes not.  He loves his car, and he treats it great, so he didn't 'deserve' this to happen to him.  And if he somehow ends up having to pay for another car or do something of the sort, even though he did NOTHING wrong, it will be really hard to swallow.  You know?  Not a lot else.  It's been a rough week for Tim.  And, because I love him, it has been a rough week for me.

       HE GOT THE JOB!!  HE GOT THE JOB!!  HE GOT THE JOB!!  Okay, for those of you who don't know what the heck i'm talking about, i'll elaborate.  Tim, my boyfriend, and I met while we were both working at the church.  He has been the media intern.  In the last ten months since we started dating, there has always been this thing hanging over us...what happens in June/July when his internship is up and he has to leave...and now we know.  About 3 months ago Jason (his boss) approached him about staying on staff here.  However, they have already hired one person in the media ministry in the last year, so he said to not get his hopes up...  ...but last night, after jumping through all the hoops and saying A LOT of prayer, the elders said Yes.  Tim is staying.  He's permanent.  And it's like this huge relief for us.  I don't know how else to describe it.  It's AMAZING.  I am so happy.  He is so happy.  And, more importantly...  GOD IS SO GOOD!

       The Typewriter  There is a typewriter in my office.  Yes, a real one.  It works and everything.  Actually, it's one of the later models of typewriters--electric. (but not the kind with the screen where you could type like four lines of text before it actually went to the paper) Sometimes I have to use it and recently I have really enjoyed it.  I have become familiar with the sound of the keyboard on my computer and even more familiar with the sound of my laptop at home.  And then, I turn on the typewriter, slip in a piece of paper, and I'm...writing.  The click of the keys, the need for correction tape, watching all the mistakes I make when I type pile up...it's almost magical!  I don't know what it is about the keys, the sound, the DING at the end of a line.  More thought goes in to what I type there.  I'm slower and more deliberate, because making a mistake takes so much longer to correct.  In fact, I'm not even sure we have the means to correct any mistakes made on that machine here.  At least, none that I have come across during the great office move.  Because it is harder, you have to take your time and really enjoy the moment.  And even though the things I use it for (making offering envelopes, labels, the random form) are not that exciting, I get excited to use it.  I LIKE IT, OKAY!  :)  I am a dork, and I am okay with that.  If the typewriter in the corner of my office can inspire me, then so be it.  I am inspired.

       The Diet  In a word, The Diet sucks.  I hate it.  I've jumped on the band wagon and am trying to do the South Beach Diet.  The first two weeks are supposed to be the hardest--no carbs (no bread, no pasta, no fruit, no sweets) and it's rough.  I am, quite frankly, going crazy.  I would pretty much kill for an apple right now.  Or some pasta or a piece of pizza...or whatever the heck I can find...I started a week ago.  Or, more exactly, a week and 2 days.  And I am ready to be done with this part of it.  I hate it.  I'm so hungry.  I've been so hungry for a week.  I thought I could do it.  I think I can do it, but my will power is quickly fading.  Even more quickly than I thought.    I just feel bad.  Like sick, bad, if that makes sense.  I know that a diet changes what you eat and i know it takes awhile for your body to acclimate to that, but still.  I don't think a person should feel this sick to their stomach and this out of sorts, all because of a diet.  However, as someone who has struggled with her weight her whole life, I'm willing to try anything at least once, I guess.  I did weight watchers for quite awhile.  Did really well the first time, but then lost my motivation.  I guess I want to be thin, but I also want to be happy.  And, sometimes I wonder if losing the weight will make me happy or give me an eating disorder...or another eating disorder. :)  I think there are disorders other than anorexia and bulemia.  I am obsessed with food.  I don't think I've had a meal in a year and a half where I haven't felt guilty for something I ate.  And, THAT can't be healthy, can it?

      If you've ever felt like you're not loved enough or you think God has forgotten you, this song is a great reminder of the truth...  "More" by Matthew West  "Take a look at the mountain  Stretching a mile high  Take a look at the ocean  Far as your eye can see  And think of Me   Take a look at the desert  Do you feel like a grain of sand?  I am with you wherever  Where you go is where I am   And I'm always thinking of you  Take a look around you  I'm spelling it out one by one   (Chorus)  I love you more than the sun  And the stars that I taught how to shine  You are mine, and you shine for me too  I love you yesterday and today  And tomorrow, I'll say it again and again  I love you more   Just a face in the city  Just a tear on a crowded street  But you are one in a million  And you belong to Me   And I want you to know  That I'm not letting go  Even when you come undone   (Chorus)  I love you more than the sun  And the stars that I taught how to shine  You are mine, and you shine for me too  I love you yesterday and today  And tomorrow, I'll say it again and again  I love you more   Shine for Me  Shine for Me  Shine on, shine on  Shine for Me   (Chorus)  I love you more than the sun  And the stars that I taught how to shine  You are mine, and you shine for me too  I love you yesterday and today  And tomorrow, I'll say it again and again  I love you more"

       Many Random Thoughts...   I haven't blogged in awhile, although I have been meaning to do so; time has just been not on my side, I guess.  So here are a bunch of random thoughts in no particular order :)  Enjoy   Random Thought #1  I miss talking to Liz already.  We both worked at jobs where we could be in contact during the day...maybe one of the benefits of email.  Well, she got a new job, and she just started yesterday, and I'm not sure that I'll hear from her as often.  I didn't really realize until Tuesday how much I enjoy getting her "good morning :)" emails.  It's just nice to know that someone is thinking about you first thing in the morning-at least someone that you don't see every day.  So Liz, I know you'll read this eventually and I just want to say thanks for always making my mornings a little brighter.  I am so excited about your new job!!  You're going to do great.   Random Thought #2  Cicadas.  Yuck.  I hate bugs, I'll be honest.  I know they're an important part of the circle of life and that everything plays an important role...BLAH BLAH BLAH.  I don't care how important they are, a million bugs an acre is about a million too many.   According to the Indianapolis Star, they have begun appearing in Southern Indiana already and should be in the Central part of the state by this weekend.  Let me say again....YUCK :) Not looking forward to it at all...but I guess the sooner they get here, the sooner they can just GO AWAY, right :)   Random Thought #3   urlLink American Idol.   Up to this point, I have not allowed the pop culture, closet interest in American Idol out.  But honestly, they (and I mean they because I didn't vote...so maybe I don't really care THAT much) voted off my favorite person last night.  Interesting.  If I wanted to try really hard, I could liken the voting on American Idol to so many things; the idle (no pun intended) way we look at our lives, etc...but let's be honest here.  It is a TV show and I think finding the deeper meaning would only make me sound a little more like a freak than I already am...but if you want to know, that's cool.  Leave me a comment and I'll elaborate more :)   Random Thought #4  If I actually sat down and wrote as much as I think about how much I'd like to be a professional writer, I'd be there already.  Why do we sit on our dreams instead of acting on them?   Random thought #5  It's really annoying when you find the PERFECT font for your blog, but no one else can appreciate it because they don't have it.  Go  urlLink here  to download the "CARE BEAR FAMILY" font.  Then you can see the page the way I do! YAY!

      Another Monday Morning...  I'm sitting at my desk eating some Strawberry Burst Cheerios and pondering the weekend.  I went home.  It was wonderful.  My little brother received his Black Belt in Karate, not a poor achievement for a 13 year old!  So, Friday night we went home.  I took Tim with me.  I was a little nervous--that whole actually spending TIME with my family thing--but, not surprisingly, it was a wonderful weekend.  He fit right in with parents and Cameron.   It was nothing amazing; a little thing, in fact, but it meant the world to me that he was there.  And once again, I feel even MORE affirmed that I am one lucky girl in one great relationship.   If you know Tim at all, you know just how special he is and just how special he makes me feel.  This weekend was just one great expression of that after another.  I think the more amazing thing is just how well we know each other and how well we compliment each other in the little things.  We can laugh and be silly, but we can also have some really powerful and meaningful talks.  We can just sit in silence, or we can sing along to the radio.    And, after 9 months, I'm learning that there are many more ways to say "I love you" and "you are important to me" than just with words.  They are things said in tender touches, in big bear hugs, in the wiping away of random tears.  They are said with soft kisses on moist cheeks and with the willingness to deal with your allergies just because it's important to your girlfriend that you go home with her.  It's in laughter.  It's in the way you rest your hand on my back and the way you cuddle close to me.  It's the sparkle in your eyes when you see me and the way you say hello.   It's the security I feel when I think of our relationship.  It's the way you've banished the insecure version of me.  It's the way I look at you and just KNOW that everything is going to be fine.  It's knowing that you care.  It's simply being near you.    As I was saying, it was a great weekend.  I love my family, I love being with my family, and I love that Tim got to go home with me to be around them, as well!

       Sometimes You Feel Like a Nut   Sometimes you don't.  I don't know which I am today, which probably makes me a nut, right?  Sorry it's been so long since I've written anything.  I spent most of last week organizing my office and files (getting rid of the stuff from the lady that had this job before me and getting her computer files, etc, organized), and generally being a lazy slob.  Not an excuse, but still :)  Tim made it back from Mexico in one piece, even though his luggage arrived safely several hours  after  he did...ah well.  It was so great to see him again.  Sometimes the amount of love I feel for him is overwhelming, but always in a good way.   So, I've made a decision-and a hard one at that.  This year, for the first time ever, I am not going on vacation with my family.  It sucks.  It's just one of those things--family vacations have  always  been a big deal for my family.  It's one of those things; they're always a little crazy and a little nuts, always an adventure and always insane, but always good.  However, due to timing and the fact that my July is already very busy, I just can't do it this year.  I don't know how I feel about it.  I'm sad and it's going to be really strange to see pictures of them at places I've never been, but I guess I'm growing up.  The weekends they're going to be gone are the weekends of the wedding of two good friends here at the church and the other weekend is Tim and I's one year anniversary.  I just don't like this growing up thing at all.  However, cameron is going to come down and hang out with me for a couple days this summer.  He's awesome and I love him, so that will be great.  I'm actually really looking forward to it; then I will go home for a long weekend sometime, too.  It's just so strange to be an adult.  I guess I need to stop saying that and just get over it, but (imagine whiney voice here) I DON'T WANT TO!  That's not true, I guess...I want to grow up and 'get over it' but it's a very strange thing for me.  However, I am so thankful for the fact that I have gotten to go on some GREAT family vacations in the past.  Last year alone I went to the 100th Anniversary of Flight Air Show, Florida, and Costa Rica.  All were awesome trips.  The year before that...was that Washington DC?  I think it was.  There have been so many great trips.  It will be strange for them to go see Old Faithful and Mt. Rushmore without me, but there is simply no way I could spend that many days cooped up in the back of a car.  If it wasn't the weekend of the wedding, I would probably have flown out to Seattle for a long break, but it's just not going to work out.  How strange is that...reminds me of the Billy Joel song, "Souvenir"  "...and every year's a souvenir that slowly fades away."

      This is what I spent three hours of my life watching last night.  Funny thing is, I knew what number 1 would be from the start :)  Then again, it's pretty much a no-brainer.  Watching it made me realize how much I miss the movie musical though.  I love them and they just don't exist anymore.  I mean, there are a couple, but the feel-good Gene Kelly era is gone...ah well...   urlLink CNN.com - List of 100 best movie songs - Jun 23, 2004

      Okay, I'll admit it...I'm going a little crazy without him.  Tim left on Saturday morning to go to Mexico for a week and I haven't spoken to him since he touched down in San Diego around 1:00 that afternoon.  I know it's silly and I know I should be able to function completely normally without him for a week, but the fact of the matter is...I don't WANT to.  I want him to be here.  I want to miss him.  I want to whisper that I love him and hold him close.  I know that it is so selfish of me, and I'm working on that.  I do want him to have a great time.  I hope it is a fruitful and growing experience.  I hope and pray that he's safe and healthy and feeling close to God.  I hope he's getting all the video that he needs to make a great piece.  I pray that he feels my love and knows that I am praying so hard for him.  He'll be home around 4:30 on Saturday and we're going to head to Mt. Pleasant to go to church and then back home.  I'm counting down the days, but my heart is anxious.  I don't think anything will change while he's gone, but of course I had dreams that said just the opposite last night.  I think as long as I live, I will never understand dreams.  There's a Chris Rice song that says something about when he gets to heaven, he'll have a million questions for God and one of them will be why we dream and what they mean.  I'm with him on that one.  Cinderella says "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes" but I'm not buying that one at all.  I'm thinking that a dream is something completely different.  Thoughts?

      It has been a productive week, thank goodness.  I am not looking forward to everyone leaving next week.  In fact, the mass exodus has begun.  Slowly and surely there are people leaving.  The church is getting more and more empty, that's for sure.  Anyway, I recently made some changes on the ol' blog.  I like the picture and I like how it makes me feel a bit more peaceful...unfortunately, I haven't been able to figure out how to get my font back...ah well, what can I do.  I ran across the quote at the top again recently when I was talking to Liz about the song "Windmills."  The quote is so much my life.  To be too sane is madness...how about that??!!??  I think I often lead a life that is almost too safe and secure.  I want to know that there is something more out there, but I too often do not let things challenge or change me.  Maybe next week will be a good way to start that...no one will be around; I will have way too much free time on my hands, so I can start evaluating things and getting things figured out.  My goal is to write more, and this is a great week to start this.  In fact, why should I wait for tomorrow, when I can start right now.  Every life is a story--and I know mine is in there somewhere.  I'll just have to find it.  And I will find it, dear reader, I promise I will find it.  And you will all know it someday!

      Well, i haven't really had TIME to blog and really don't now, but here I go anyway. :)  The verdict is in on Tim's car.  It has been totaled with something like $4100 worth of damage.  He's getting a little more than that from the insurance company, so it's making a nice down payment on his new car--a 2005 Corolla.  It's nice.  Okay, so we haven't seen it yet; but it's been ordered and should arrive while he is in Mexico on the mission trip.  He's getting anxious to see it and actually handling all of this stuff a lot better than i would, i am sure of that.    What else?  It's an absolutely crazy couple of weeks at work.  Between our newsletter, the directory, graduation Sunday and my regular job duties, i'm swamped and barely keeping my head up this week.  Ah well, it's good stress, though.  I love my job and I love being busy, I just wish  everything  wasn't due at the same time. :)  Life is so good, though.  We went to the zoo (Indianapolis) on Saturday last week.  I love the zoo. It's just so much fun to me to see all the animals and to spend the day outside enjoying the weather.  I'll post a couple pictures in a bit.  A lot of my friends are going to be gone the week of the 19-26.  Tim, Diane, Karen, and Kelly will be in Mexico.  Liz and Jenny will be in California.  Rene is house-sitting.  It's going to be a very relaxing week--or a very boring week.  But, I am sure it will be good for me.  The plan is to take at least one day off and enjoy the not being busy, but I'm not sure that will work out either.  I'm going through that I don't want to just sit and do nothing phase lately.  I'm in a drama this weekend at church...and I'm yet to memorize my lines :) WHOOPS :)

      Well, the verdict will be in on Tim's car tomorrow.  The semi-exact quote from the insurance people is that it 'may not be repairable.'  This is not the news we were hoping for at all.  You look at the pictures below and judge for yourself. I mean, I'm not an expert at all, but it seems like if 3 of the four sides of your car are fine, then it shouldn't be worthless.  So yeah, say a prayer that the insurance people decide to fix it, because that will make Tim's life a whole lot easier and happier.  thanks!

       Thoughts on Passion  In the spirit of my post from earlier this morning (below), here are some thoughts on passion that I found while working on a devo for Sunday a.m. a few months ago...   No matter what your calling might be, part of the trick of staying passionate is to remember what it was like at the beginning,when something inside you said, “This is it.” ~Kevin Spacey&nbsp; &nbsp;   Passion:&nbsp; intense, driving, or overmastering feeling or conviction &nbsp;  “Seize the day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. Why does the writer use these lines?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we are food for worms lads. Because, believe it or not, each and every one of us in this room is one day going to stop breathing, turn cold, and die…Invincible, just like you feel. The world is their oyster. They believe they're destined for great things, just like many of you. Their eyes are full of hope, just like you. Did they wait until it was too late to make from their lives even one iota of what they were capable? Because you see gentlemen, these boys are now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen real close, you can hear them whisper their legacy to you. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,  Make your lives extraordinary.” Dead Poets Society  &nbsp; &nbsp;“We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. Medicine, law, business, engineering, these are all noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman: "O me, o life of the questions of these recurring, of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities filled with the foolish. What good amid these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are here. That life exists, and identity. &nbsp;That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.  What will your verse be?” Dead Poets Society  &nbsp; "One person with passion is better than forty people merely interested." —&nbsp;&nbsp; E. M. Forster   Excerpts from “Dreaming in Motivation”   "But back in your mind and deep in your heart, a dream still lies unfulfilled.&nbsp; A dream to start your own business, to be a missionary, to design a clothing line or be an engineer for NASA.&nbsp; These desires define you; you’re consumed with thoughts of them night and day.&nbsp; Coincidence? Annoying obsession? Hardly. Most people figure this out sooner or later, that God has given us each an innate purpose, complemented by our talents, skills, and desires.&nbsp; Some misuse their gifts (or lack thereof), some bury them away, some dabble, and others tap them for everything they’re worth.&nbsp; My guess would be that the average human being uses his gifts enough just to get by, if at all.&nbsp; All of us have dreams, but most of the time we settle for what is more “attainable” or “realistic…”   Who are you? &nbsp; What is it that you consistently love, dream of, and perhaps even pursue on some level or another without even maybe realizing that it might be a fundamental part of the definitive calling on your life?   Life is too short , so do what you love, and more importantly, do it for God, who you should love even more.&nbsp; Begin right where you are.&nbsp; Don’t wait for things to get better, more convenient, ideal, or anything else of the sort.&nbsp; That wouldn’t require faith.&nbsp; That would require change, and change won’t come without even the most basic of faith being put into action.&nbsp;    God didn’t design you to fail. &nbsp; He didn’t mess up.&nbsp; It is no mistake, the person that you are.&nbsp; The passions of your heart, the visions of your mind, the skills of your hands were all uniquely assigned to you as His child.&nbsp;    God has no insignificant plans for you , whether rich or poor, black or white, atheist or Christian.&nbsp; He knew you before you were even formed in your mother’s womb.&nbsp; That’s pretty intimate.&nbsp; Somehow I doubt that your dreams are all that foreign to Him either.&nbsp; In fact, I would bet that He personally authored them, and is only waiting for you to believe plainly enough in that higher reality to live it out."

       "Open the gates, and seize the day"   I've been singing songs from "Newsies" since yesterday.&nbsp; It's a great show, so that's fine with me.&nbsp; I'm well aware that it's a Disney movie, but this song has always been an anthem of sorts for me  ..."don't be afraid and don't delay."  &nbsp; That is the new song of my life.&nbsp; My fears (of failure, of being outcast, of people not liking what I do or not liking my style) have kept me from following the passions of my heart for long enough.&nbsp; I am going to change that.&nbsp; More writing.&nbsp; Look for acting opportunities outside of the SOCC Drama Ministry.&nbsp; Do something positive in the world.&nbsp; Put myself out there and embrace my God-given abilities and gifts.&nbsp;   I like what  The Message  says about it (Romans 12:6)&nbsp; "Let's just go ahead and be what we were made to be, without enviously or pridefully comparing ourselves with each other, or trying to be something we aren't."   Just go ahead and be what we were made to be...I bet it's harder than it sounds...   In an attempt to do just that, I have started another blog.&nbsp; This one is for my writing.&nbsp; Skits, Poems, short stories...fiction, nonfiction...it will all be  urlLink  here   now.

       The Miracle of Friendship  I was reminded of something last night that I have often taken for granted--true friendships are real and rare.&nbsp; I have just a handful of people in my life that I know I can count on when the world comes crashing down; I won't name them here...they know who they are.&nbsp; They are the men and women in my life that have experienced impossible joys and tragic lows and were still able to bring a smile to my face as they wipe away my tears.&nbsp; These are the people that are so genuine, so completely real in who they are that I do not question them.&nbsp; I know that their obsessions with shoes and music and the 80's and books and games and everything else is 100% their identity.&nbsp; I know their faith is real and I know they believe in the power of love and friendship in ways that the world does not understand.&nbsp; These are the people that do nothing but hold my hand and cry with me as I tell a room full of Venezuelan people my testimony.&nbsp; These are the people that make me laugh until my sides hurt and who look at me and see the person I am working to become instead of the person I am currently.&nbsp; They are the people that love the fact that sometimes I talk a million miles a minute and sometimes I have nothing more to say.&nbsp; They are the people that will rub my feet until I fall asleep and then sneak out of the room.&nbsp; They are the people who embrace me and love me and cherish every moment we get to spend together.&nbsp; They are the people that know I hate making decisions but know the exact right thing to say to make me realize I've already made it; just not acknowledged it.&nbsp;   I have people in my life who have come and gone; some have lingered maybe too long, some were a part all too fleetingly...but there is the tried and true, the ones I will still be laughing with when we get to go Home.&nbsp; And that is the miracle of friendship.

       It's Alarm/Smoke Detector Testing Day  I just found out that today is the day our sprinklers, alarms, etc get tested.&nbsp; I understand the need for these tests, trust me.&nbsp; We're sitting in a huge facility worth a lot of money and the church has already suffered one fire (in the old building...almost gutted it), but I'll be honest.&nbsp; This is NOT my favorite day of the year.&nbsp; Why, you say?&nbsp; Because to test them, they have to clean out the sprinkler system, which makes it smell like sulfer, rotten eggs, and vomit in here.&nbsp; Then they turn the alarms--the really loud obnoxious alarms--on and off all day testing different systems.&nbsp; So, today is going to be interesting. :)  Not a lot else going on in my world.&nbsp; My family left at the crack of dawn this morning for vacation.&nbsp; It's very strange to know they're on a plane flying to Seattle and I'm still just sitting here.&nbsp; I guess this means I am really a grown up now.&nbsp; I'm excited about New York in October and excited about hearing about their trip, but it will still be kind of strange.&nbsp; Mom did get a cell-hone, though.&nbsp; That's a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two years ago we went to Washington DC for family vacation.&nbsp; We're on the really under construction Pennsylvania Turnpike (in the left lane) when yeah, the transmission dies in the van.&nbsp; We get it to the other side of the road and lo and behold, there we are.&nbsp; I had my cell, so we were able to call for help, which is a good thing.&nbsp; Otherwise, we would have been screwed.&nbsp; As it was, we sat there in the August heat listening to the semis speed by and inhaling all of those lovely fumes for like 3 hours.&nbsp; I can only imagine what it would have been like had we not been able to find a towing company open on a Sunday and get a rental car.&nbsp; It was nuts.&nbsp; SO yeah, with them driving this car back from Seattle, I feel much better knowing they have some way of communication in the event something rough happens.  Tessa and Korry are getting married in a little more than 48 hours.&nbsp; 3:30 on Saturday to be exact.&nbsp; I'm very excited for them.&nbsp; I adore them both and know they're 'made for each other' as it were.&nbsp; They are going to have a great life and a great support system and I am so glad I will be there to witness it all.&nbsp;    urlLink gathering 6:29  begins again in a couple weeks.&nbsp; I'm not sure how I feel about that.&nbsp; Part of me is excited, but part of me isn't.&nbsp; I got so burned out with it last year, I'm not sure I'm ready for it to start up again.&nbsp; I need to figure out how involved I want to be, I guess.&nbsp; That will make a difference.&nbsp; It's a service geared for the post-modern generation, but became a lot like youth group.&nbsp; I know they want to remedy that and make some changes, but I just don't know how possible that is.&nbsp; I guess we'll just have to wait and see, right?  Not a lot else.&nbsp; Just hanging out and trying to stay awake.&nbsp; For some reason I'm exhausted.&nbsp; I think I'm fighting a cold or something.&nbsp; As nuts as the weather has been (inside and out--my office could double for the SOCC morgue somedays), it wouldn't surprise me in the least.&nbsp; And my stomach is making some FREAKY noises :)  &nbsp;

       I love this man...   There are a million little things a person can do to tell you that they love you.&nbsp; For me, Tim did something very special that he may not even realize (at least not until he reads this).&nbsp; My good good friend Annie is getting married in October.&nbsp; October 2, to be exact.&nbsp; In Yarmouth Port/West Dennis Massachusetts.&nbsp; I want nothing more than to be there for her wedding.&nbsp; I haven't seen her in forever, but I love her dearly.&nbsp; Now, going to Cape Cod for the weekend isn't exactly something that is cheap to do.&nbsp; My mom has offered to help out with some money, but it will still cost us a little to get there, and do our thing.&nbsp; He had agreed to go, which already made me really excited.&nbsp; Then, after church 2 Sundays ago, he finds me in the Worship Center and says he has something he wants to show me at his desk...    &nbsp;   He'd been doing some research....  and had found plane tickets into New York City for under 120 bucks each.&nbsp; So, he had then planned not just the wedding trip, but a great weekend getaway for the 2 of us.&nbsp; New York on Friday, train to Connecticut, pick up the rental car, drive to the Cape.&nbsp; Saturday is driving around the cape (New England in the fall!!) and the wedding.&nbsp; Sunday we'll drive around New England some more.&nbsp; Monday we'll drop the car off and head back into New York.&nbsp; Our plane home leaves that night.&nbsp; I am SOOOO excited and I am so blown away that he cares for me.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  The moral of the story:&nbsp; He knew going to annie's wedding was important to me.&nbsp; He knew that I really wanted to have him there...and so he made it happen.&nbsp; He is amazing.&nbsp; July 31 is our 1 year anniversary.&nbsp; It's been the best year of my life.    &nbsp;  Tim, if you're reading this, I love you more every moment.

       The Strangest Day Ever  Today is already shaping up to be one of the strangest days I've been through in a long time.  It seemed to start out normal enough.  I woke up late and didn't want to get ready.  Anyway, it's approx. 8:49 a.m.  and here is what has happened thus far:  ~in the shower, I put my face wash in my hair...and yeah...tried to wash my face with my shampoo first.    ~the news...two men were arrested in Martinsville yesterday for holding up a convenience store...next to the SHERRIF'S office.  ~leaving the apartment this morning was like leaving an episode of "The Truman Show."  That's right.  First there was the character "Little Old Lady with 'Roids."  She was all hunched over and walking so slowly it was almost backwards...with this kind of scary, kind of funny, kind of REALLY disturbing smile on her face.  She was followed, at the same speed, by "Middle Eastern Man in really REALLY short Shorts and a big farmer hat."  He was, let's see...SCARY :)  I know this makes me sound a bit racist, but I assure you that is not the case.  Confused, yes.  Racist, no. :)  ~on Country Club Lane...there was a man with a beard riding a motorcycle...and wearing a black lace bra on the outside of his clothes.  ~at the roundabout...a Dodge RAM driving REALLY slow with what appeared to be a 12 year old behind the wheel...and a 2 year old bouncing all over the seats....  ~Audrey, the 50 something woman who is our business manager, just karate-chopped a bug on her desk.  So that's been my morning.  I feel like I'm in the middle of the children's book "Wacky Wednesday" only it's Tuesday....Thoughts?

       I Hit A Bird...and Laughed  Okay, I'll admit it...I'm a bit of a bad person.  This morning on my way to work I hit a bird.  With my car (instead of my hands, if that is what you were thinking).  And, did I cry?  No.  I laughed.  And then I called Rene, who also laughed.  I know it's bad, but C'MON!  The thing has wings.  It can  FLY .  Why did it not get out of the way of my car?  I don't know, but there was a thump, then there was a bird tumbling through the air in my rearview mirror.  Then there were feathers this morning when I got to work.  All in all, it's been an interesting morning.  Does it make my cynical that I killed an innocent bird and just laughed?  Or would you in the same situation?

       A Gripe  Why in the world is it that I can read like 90% of the Indianapolis Star online, but it's like 6 bucks a month to read the local Bloomington paper?  It's the only real source of news in bloomington that is more localized, but honestly...I am NOT going to pay that for the once in awhile that I want to read the paper.  I'll just settle for Indy news.  It's slightly less biased, anyway.     ANYWAY :)  My little brother, Cameron, is coming down to spend a few days with me next week.  Should be fun.  I'm excited, just have to figure out what the heck we should do...bowling, miniature golf, games, swimming...who knows.  it'll be fun, though.  We'll figure it out, i'm sure :)  Not a lot else.  Slow week here, I guess. :)

       The Greatest Woman in the World   I would like to take this blog and dedicate it to the greatest woman I have ever met in my life--my mother.  She is so many things that I cannot even begin to put them into words, but I would like to try.   She has dreamed my biggest (and silliest) dreams.  No matter what my dreams have been, from wanting to be the first woman president of the moon to an actress, to a writer, to a teacher...no matter what, she has been my strongest supporter.  None of my dreams have ever been silly or pointless or unbelievable.  She has always believed in me and in them.    She is my strongest supporter.  The world could be stacked against me and she still believes in me.  She always, 'has my back' as it were.  She trusts me and loves me in those ways that just don't make sense to me.  She was at every theater performance, band contest, marching band show, awards night...you name it and she was there.  In marching band, I knew she was there by the sound of her whistle.  In theatre, she once told me my eyes sparkled on stage, and it stayed with me forever.   She has always been exactly who she is.  I have to look no farther than my mom to see what a person with strong convictions and strong self-image is like.  My mother does not hide who she is, and she makes no attempt to change herself to 'fit in' with other people.  She's bold and she's funny.  She's smart and she's beautiful.  She's strong in so many ways, and yet will hold you tenderly if you need it.  She will say exactly what she feels and she will give you the best advice in the world.  She also knows when to not say anything at all and just let you learn on your own.   She's one of my best friends.  No child could love a mother more.  I love to talk to her; to share my struggles and my successes with her.  I value her advice and her thoughts about every aspect of my life.  I know that she's never farther away than a phone call, and always there when I need her.  She loves me enough to let me be a 'grown up' but I will never forget that I will always be her little girl.  We can stay up all night laughing or sit and play cards forever.  Whatever we do together, whether it's building puzzles, shopping and trying on clothes, or simply going for a walk, it is awesome.   She's my aspiration.  I've said it once and I'll say it again.  My mother is the woman I want to be.  Hopefully every day I'm turning into her a little more.  Her confidence, her poise, her conviction, her love, her beauty...these are the things that I have learned from her.  Mom, I love you.    ~ Your Little Girl, Emmy

       The 100th Post...  I'm not sure if it makes me crazy or that I just have a lot to say, but this, according to Blogger, is the 100th Post I have put on this website.  Insane.  Anyway...  Because of where ther Bloomington office for my insurance company is located, I ended up at my former employer this morning.  It used to be 1stBooks Library, and is now Authorhouse.  It was a print-on-demand publishing company where if you could afford it, you could have anything printed you wrote.  Now, I won't go into all the many many reasons why I left that job and how happy I am that I did so, but even this morning, there was a bit of nostalgia that creeped in.  There were some good people that worked there, and every once in awhile we actually published a really good book.  It's just strange to walk into a group of people that used to be so familiar and now they're in a new building with new management and practically an entire new staff.  strange.  Anyway, a GRIPE for this morning...Part of my job (as I see it and it has been explained to me) is to make our database work for the ministries it supports...so I spend a lot of my time working in the database and trying to brainstorm ways for it to be used more efficiently.  I do this because it's important to me and because I enjoy it.  For example, we actually track attendance at SOCC.  It's only as good as the information we get, so I'm well aware that it is not perfect.  After posting attendance, we do an absentee report to catch the people that are no longer attending, have missed a few weeks, etc.  Now granted in the summer it's much more difficult to do.  Anyway...people that end up on this list often end up there even though they are at church--they do not sign in because they are volunteering for a ministry.  So, I tried to make a way to get a list of the people that are serving so that we can give them attendance and they don't get calls that say "we've noticed you haven't been at church in awhile" when really they were just there singing or whatever...and for some reason, some people do not think this is a good idea.  for me, if i was actively involved in a ministry and someone called and said we've noticed that you haven't been here, i would be a little offended/hurt because i was just volunteering!! I guess, I can't make everyone happy, but sometimes I just don't understand why people choose the battles they choose.

       As If I Don't Have Enough Issues...  I think I've probably mentioned a time or two that my office could double for the SOCC morgue. yeah, it really is that cold in here. I hate it. Anyway, I'm slowly learning to at least remember to bring a jacket to wear while I'm in my office, regardless of the temperature outside. So today I have on my black dress pants and dress shoes and a pink tank-top (and look kinda cute). I brought with me this new black jacket with white piping that I got for 3 whole cash dollars at the Sam's Club a couple weeks ago. So, after doing my Monday morning counting, I went ahead and put it on...like an hour ago.  Dear reader, I've been walking around with a sticker that says "large" on my breast for the last hour. You know, one of those size stickers....Now, I have issues with my chest size anyway (my whole family has been well blessed), and then I'm walking around my place of employment, my CHURCH with a sticker that says large right there. I noticed it a few seconds ago when I went to the restroom. Hopefully no one else noticed...how embarrassing!

       Uh...  So I had to run some errands on my way to work this morning; drop off my rent and run to the dr.'s office to pick up a letter...and decided what I really wanted was a nice big glass of O.J. and a hashbrown from McDonald's for breakfast.  There wasn't really a line, so I swung through the drive thru, placed my order, gave the nice man at the first window 2.24, and proceeded up to the second window.  I got my hashbrown and my OJ in rapid order...and then I sat there for like 10 minutes.  Why, you ask?  Because the McDonald's people put the trash can and the newspaper boxes right beside the drive thru.  The van in front of me decided to sit there and READ the stupid front pages of both of the newspapers through the glass, while a line was forming behind them.  The girl in the window looked out and shook her head and made a motion like I should honk.  Now, I don't like to honk my horn; I think it can be rude...but it didn't really matter because the guy in the car behind me got to it first.  The woman passenger in the van turned around and gave  me  a dirty look, to which I smiled.  Then, they went back to reading for a few more seconds before inching EVER SO SLOWLY forward enough for me to get around them...  ...in response I say...uh, right.  Who put the newspaper boxes right there in the first place?  If a pedestrian wanted to get one, they'd probably get ran over while standing there fishing change out of their pocket.  But still, who sits in their car eating and reading the front page of the paper (at least what is above the fold, which is usually a pretty big picture and not a lot of text) knowing that there are people behind you?  I just don't get it sometimes, I'll be honest :)

       Updated  Several months ago  urlLink Liz  and I started a blog dedicated to books.  Why, you ask? Because we read ALL THE TIME!  But, for some reason, neither of us had really been updating it.  I took care of that this morning, adding  urlLink 3 new entries .  Now we just have to keep on top of it.  I'll be excited to read what she has to say aobut WICKED once she reads it. :)   Anyway, check it out and keep on us to keep it updated.    Moving  My roommate, Rene, is moving at the end of the month.  I haven't really talked about it here because it happened so fast, but it's coming soon.  She's one of my absolute best friends, and I am going to miss living with her.  We are not going our own ways because we are tired of each other or because we are angry with each other...we just both need our space.  She'll start school at the end of the month and we're both feeling cramped in our townhouse.  It's a nice place, and cheap, but we both have lots of stuff shoved into our bedrooms, which doesn't make for the most comfortable living arrangement.  And, there are things I won't miss...dirty dishes and having to schedule our times to be downstairs almost (since we're both in relationships) but I will miss her laughter and knowing that she's there.  I'll miss our grumbly exchanged glances at 7 in the morning when we're both getting ready for work.  I'll miss the way we can curl up on the couches under our fleece blankets and sleep or watch hours of Friends.  I'll miss the way we know each other well enough to know when to speak and when to just let it go and I love that we know each other better than we know ourselves.  I'll miss her music and her watching TV and the way she knows exactly when I just need a hug.  I'll miss the little notes and the way neither of us bothered to take down a "Happy Birthday" sign for over a year.  I love her and I hope that we stay just as close later as we do now.

       No Drama  I think I got enough drama in college. For some reason, my ability to be sympathetic and understanding to people has been drastically reduced by the fact that they bring so many of their problems on themselves. I know I can be a nut, but I hope that I live a pretty non-dramatic life. Sure, I cry sometimes (or a lot, depending on who you ask) but I'm not given to angry speeches and I don't yell...and I certainly don't think the world revolves around me. I know that there are things about my life that I would like to change and things that are not exactly as I would like them to be, but at the same time, I have a nice calmness about my life. I don't know if it's exactly a Bible verse, but an idea keeps coming back to me...whatever you do, do it for God. Even if it's not your 'dream job' or the perfect situation. If you do everything in your life like you're doing it exclusively for God, then how can you be unhappy? God wants you to be His, even if that means doing things that you think are 'beneath' you. Does that mean God wants you stuck in a job you don't like? Not at all; maybe your discontent comes from the fact that you're actually not doing what He wants you to do right now. Or maybe you are discontent because you're not embracing what He wants you to do; instead you are sitting in a pool of self pity. No wonder you're not happy.  My friend Liz is exactly the opposite of my frustrations. Was she in a job she was very tired of? You bet she was! Was she ready for a change? Without a doubt. But, did she still do her job every day until God opened up the most incredible job-door in the world for her? You better believe it. She did it for God, and He blessed her with a great opportunity.  If everyone who was 'so unhappy' in their situation did what she did--do it for God and constantly seek other opportunities--then I don't think people would be as miserable as they are now.  Anyway, that's my gripe today. Instead of complaining about how your job isn't what you think it should be, do the job you're supposed to do. The rewards will come when you make the job you've been given, no matter how little it is, and do it as if it were the most important thing in the world.

       Wonderful Together  Okay, I'll admit it...I had a wonderful time this weekend.  Tim and I celebrated our 1-year anniversary.  That's right, now we're one of those couples who has been together for more than a year.  Completely cheesy to get excited about, I know, but whatever.  I'm young and I'm in love so there! :)  Yes, Tim and I had a great weekend.  We both took Friday off and went to Dayton to the  urlLink United States Air Force Museum .  If you've never been and you enjoy airplanes and the history of how man got off the ground, then you should check it out.  Open seven days a week, that's right...and it's free!  There should be more free things like this in the world.  :)  Anyway, we spent all of Friday at the museum and then headed to Donato's for dinner.  That was special because we ate at Donato's the week before we started dating...as friends. :)  Then all of Saturday we spent back at the museum, seeing the stuff we had missed the day before.  We  thought  we were going to have to go through 1 hanger, but it turned out there was another one that wasn't on the map...so yeah, more than we thought, which is great!  Saturday was the official day and we exchanged gifts and cards, which is always fun.  I think we really know what the other one enjoys, so gift buying is always fun (although can be stressful, I will admit) and exchanging is always exciting.  In fact, I am the proud new owner of a Serta Sheep!  Okay, so it's a long story that probably won't be as exciting to anyone but Tim and I, but trust me, I LOVE IT!   After a year, I can say that I love Tim B. Bedwell more than I ever thought I could love another person.  What I feel for him makes anything I had felt in the past seem pale in comparison.  I love his smile, his laugh...the way he makes 'fun' of me and the way he holds me tight.  He's the most amazing person I have ever met in my life, and I can't wait to see what the next year together holds!!  Happy Monday everyone!
