      apart from the previous, today is in fact a great day.. life is no longer boring.. haha.. needless to mention, the daily routine still goes on but schooling is much more interesting now with optimisim.. take it that i'm a bad boy, i've been skipping classes as easy and as convenient as i like.. but dun be mistaken.. i know my priority right.. taking into account the disastrous teachers(not all) whom may take away my precious time, i might as well relax myself at home or go for a swim(which i just had one).. 20laps, not alot but still good for a start.. months since i last swam and cool enough, i managed to keep it under 40mins for 20 laps.. tt means 2min/lap.. wahhaha.. tml's AMKSS silver jubilee le.. kindna hectic but i needa go back.. not due to any specific reasons, but juz to pay my tribute to my school... its AMKSS tt has brought to me thus far.. (for u guys whom do not know bout' my past, forget it den! haha) let's cheers and AMKsians, enjoy yourself tml ! Cheers !

      for no special reason, it has been a tiring day for me.. day was as per normal without much progress nor any interesting thing stuff happening.. its all about waking up at 6.30am, going to sch to attend lessons and den get back home after school.. wat's much better rather than attending schools? ... desperately needing a guiding star which can truly motivate me to study ;).....

      a short yet long day.. irony is e word to describe.. nothing beats having a seat in the cinema, enjoying ya time.. life's just too boring man.. school ends at 1215pm when we celebrated my classmate's b'day.. yeah, 1215pm! a short day.. but yet its boring.. stupid timetable having 3straight lectures followed by a tutorial and den, home sweet home :) in any case, my destination was not to head home whilst to enjoy a show as mentioned at PS with joshua.. we caught e show 'spiderman 2' and i felt it wasn't really appealing.. wateva it is.. another boring day has gone by.. let's look forward to the next day!

      haha.. another day has passed.. that also means that it brings also another day to our A levels.. recalling what happened during our Sec 4 year when everyone was chionging like mad for the Os.. i dunnoe whether my class will be similar of that of in Sec 4.. frankly, they(2A05) may not be as hardworking as my former sec class, but they possess the liguistic ability to channel teir thinking, their thoughts and watsoever, easily onto the paper just in front of them.. maybe, that's e reason why we are in Arts Stream.. Art Stream students supposedly to possess better linguistic ability? l0lx.. in any case, my language has seriously improved by leaps and bounds.. thinking that i was previously from the last class of the english streaming in my secondary school days.. haha.. l0lx   anyway, i did not go to school again today.. take it as i play truancy bahz.. haiz, hopefully no teachers or watsoeva crap will read my blog.. haha, frankly, i was really tired today.. wanted to make use of the day to study for my econs Q&amp;A but in e end, fell aside on my bed... surprising, i woke up at 2pm... given the fact tt i slept relatively early last night.. wateva it is, time has past.. haha..   heard tt the teachers have given us back all our mid-yrs and it's not really well done.. haha, nvm.. i going sch early tml to collect my scripts den.. for all, good ntiez to all! byE~

      bleahz.. really really tired today.. once again, ironically speaking, its not a long day yet its a long day for me.. life's not getting any interesting as the days pass especially e fact that As are coming.. l0lx.. anyway, i've just got back my GP paper today.. very happy! got a B4.. wahhaa.. heard tt i alot of ppl fail in other classes lehz.. hehe.. at least i won marcus.. he got C5.. :p hehe.. (just kidding marc, no offence taken) actually, marcus is my classmate in SRJC and he's very pro in english.. he's a very good debater from my school debates and even clinched the 4th best speak during the inter-sch tournament.. e reason tt he didnt score well this time round could be that he's unlucky bahz.. coz selected questions for compo was really really badly done as according to wat our teacher mentioned as looks can be decieving.. the questions were demanding.. langage bias and meritoracy aside(u'll understand if ya marcus or ivan, l0lx.. yeah? =P) we've gotta jiayou for our As lehz.. Since Keynes started with the 'Paradox of Thrift', i shall start with my own 'Paradox of As'..   the theory goes like that.. khim believes that revision is important to get good greats for ya As.. on the other hand, with increased revision, it leads to a fall in the quantity demanded and supplied of leisure time.. consequently, standard of living will fall.. eventually, u'll be too stressed and cause yaself unneccessary frantic.. in the end, revision may even drag u down.. -.-` haha   the practicallity of this theory has yet to be proven but is strongly applicable in our day life.. in any o how u like to view ya own like.. rememer the paradox of revision :)
