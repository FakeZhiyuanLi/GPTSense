         I added a  urlLink  CafePress.com store  today.  Just a way to give gifts to people, and allow everyone who reads this a chance to support the transition back to school life (and the dramatic drop in income that usually accompanies such a transition.)     I take the GMAT on October 3, and the GRE in November.  Math class is currently quite difficult for me.  Quel suprise.  But it is a prereq for the accounting class in the spring.  Microeconomics is relatively easy.  I wonder though, do economists really stand around the water cooler at work and wonder, "What's the opportunity cost on that?"  I start volleyball in 2 weeks.  I think the exercise will do me good.  Since I don't do any now.  Anyway, go buy something.  The prices are reasonable, and the quality is good.  And if you see other products you would like to buy from my store, let me know and I'll add it.

      At work, I use 2 different computer applications to record the time I spend on different projects each week.  So why, in this information (electronic) age, do I still have to fill out a paper 'time sheet' in order to get paid?  Said time card to then sit on my boss's desk and not get turned in...

      Some of you may know I am going back to school next fall (2003) for a double Masters (MBA/MS Environmental Studies).  I am starting on the essay questions for the MBA program today:      1.  How do your background and goals, strengths and weaknesses, match up with the characteristics and offerings of the Oregon MBA Program or the Master of Accounting Program?      2.  Consider the changes wrought by the revolution in information technology; are technological advances identical with progress?      3.  A number of universities have attracted considerable notoriety for seeking to monitor and regulate the working conditions in factories owned by, or supplying university vendors.  As a future business leader, how do you view such actions?  Not sure what I'll say, but it has to be brilliant in each 500 words or less.  I've been thinking I should document this process of 'going back to school.'  I am thinking it will be a combination of this blog, video, pictures, and such.  So with this, I suppose, it begins.

      I know, I know.  We are wacky.  My mom likes to send me envelopes filled with clippings from papers and magazines.  Usually with no note to explain why the clippings are relevant.  One of the clippings this time was an add for the Master of Science (MS) program in Library and Information Science (LIS) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).  Love those acrymonious acronyms.    urlLink http://www.lis.uiuc.edu/   Apparently UIUC has a distance learning option for the LIS program.  And their LIS program was rated #1 in 1999 by US News.  (They haven't done a review since of LIS programs).  So I looked into it.  It does require some on-campus time, but since campus is only 40 minutes away from here, that isn't a big deal.  I'd get in-state tuition.  I wouldn't have to quit my job (and work may (emphasis on may) pay for some of it).  Claire could still go to school.  And in 5 years Claire and I would both have advanced a level in the school degree sitch.  The LIS program maps somewhat with what I do now.  My friend Dawn who works here has an LIS degree from Indiana University, and it is part of the reson she got the job.  And strangely it will be the same degree that my mom has.  I am not so much interested in working in a Library, per se, but the information science part is interesting.    I began the application process.  I just need to gather a few things.  Essay and whatnot.  I got the University of Oregon to send my letters of recommendation to the LIS program.  On the house side of things... not so good.  The only interest rate we've been able to get so far is 10.25%.  Outrageous!  Mostly because we have a bad credit history.  The last 2 years have been very good, but banks are looking for more like 3-4 years.  There are so many hoops to jump through.  In a way, I don't understand.  We have always made our rent payments on time.  They want you to be living in a single place for 2 years, too.  Strange.  Why would they care, since I am renting?  We keep moving because we find better places to live.  Although, looking back over the last 4 years, we have moved once each year.  Once from AK to OR, then to IL.  And twice since in IL.  Crazy.  That should bring things up to date at this point.  I guess I can still use this blog to track my upcoming education after all.  About which I am quite happy.

      Okay.  It's not being wishy-washy.  Forget the MBA.  Forget the MS.  For now.  For a couple of years now Claire has been talking about going back to school.  Recently, her interest gelled in Physics.  And really, it does make more sense for her to go back to school, rather than me.  The bad part is that we won't be leaving Illinois anytime soon.  It's just a lot cheaper to go to school here.  And I have a job that I won't lose anytime soon.  Unless that was just prophetic irony.  So, now we start down the path of getting Sagan in Day Care for next fall.  She'll be at a good age: 2.66.  Claire will work on getting all the crappy administrative stuff together for school.  Physics with a minor in Philosophy.  I will continue to plug away at my job.  Maybe start to look for something else within the company.  And we should probably buy a house.  The debt-to-income ratio is very good for us.  But the bankruptcy, and our general credit doesn't help.  We found a good house that suits us well.  Just enough fix-up stuff to make it worthwhile, but it's also pretty big.  And needs a paint job on the outside next year.  The MLS# is 2022096.  So, while we seemed to have made this decision quickly, it's actually been coming for a while.  Claire has been "following" me around doing my stuff for a while.  Now it's time for her to do something for herself.  Plus if she can get a mondo-good job, I can stay home and be a house-husband.  Ah, bliss.

      I am going to take the GMAT again.  I did the online full-length practice test (just focusing on the math) and got a 320.  If I had gotten a 320 on the real test, I'd have an unofficial 670.  So Claire bought me an Algebra refresher book.  Should help with my regular math class, too.  It boasts tricks and tools for those who get the jitters just thinking about math!  Woo.  I also got my 3 letters of recommendation.  Thank you Kim, John, and Dawn.  I have 1 of the 3 essays written for the MBA application.  (I'll be posting my responses to the essay questions when I finish them.)  And I am going to send off my Grad school application this week.  Still have to finish the MBA and MS applications.    The whole applying process needs a retooling of the user experience.  Too many different places to go to get the right information on what to send.  And often the information (even within a department) contradicts itself.

      A friend thinks I should just go for the MS in Environmental Studies.  She said (something to the effect of), "If you had to list off the reasons, off-the-cuff, as to why you want to do the MBA and why you want to do the MS, I think you would easily be able to come up with good reasons for the MS, but you might have trouble coming up with concrete and believeable reasons for the MBA."  It's not that she thinks I can't do both, or wouldn't like both.  It's that she doesn't want to see me invest all the effort and half-way through realize I don't like it.  I am not sure.  I feel like she has more to say, but then again she is usually straight-forward with her thoughts.  I am not so much questioning the idea of doing both, but I am thinking about what she said.

      I tried to add a Comments feature to allow readers (or probably reader) to post comments on what I write.  Turns out that Verizon (from whom I receive me service) only allows their canned CGI scripts on 'home' accounts.  I'll have to get a 'business' account if I want to use custom CGI.  So, no comments for now.  Though I want to add it in the future.  I believe that what you have to say about what I write can be an interesting addition to the artifact.  I'll look into what it would take to switch to a business account.

      Took the GMAT yesterday.  Not so good.  My unofficial score was 460.  170 in math (17 out of 39 questions correct), and 350 in verbal (35 out of 41 questions correct).  The 2 essays have not been scored yet, so I assume my score will go up some.  Not sure how much though.  I expect that the combined score from the 2 essays should put me over 500.  The highest I can get on the essays combined is (if I understand their scoring correctly) 120, which would give me 580.  600 is the minimum requirement for the University of Oregon (UO), so I would still be off the mark.  Should I take the GMAT again?  I think my score will go up some based on less test anxiety.  But I have never been good at math.  I really do try, but my brain just doesn't get it.  I completely get it when someone shows me how to do it, (yes I even get calculus which I always found easier than geometry) but when I go to do it myself (even mere seconds later) it doesn't gel.  The UO recently cut the amount of admitted students from around 100 to 65 in order to increase their standings for average admitted GAMT score.  I don't think my score will be helpful to them.  Is the GMAT the end-all, or will having the other parts of my app help?  My total GPA in undergrad was only 3.0 (but it was near 3.7 in my last 2.5 years, with 3 semester's honors).  The 3.0 is thanks to a 1.8 (which strangely is still a D) from Southern Oregon State College during my stint there from 1992-1993.  I feel bad for not doing well on the test.  I don't feel my score defines me, or my ability to succeed.  However, it does define me in the eyes of the admissions committee.

      The inspection and radon test were on the 11th of November.  Everything went pretty well.  For the radon test he left the detectors in for 48 hours, taking a reading each hour.  We got 1.9 picoCuries.  4 picoCuries is the upper limit, and is like smoking 20 cigarettes per day.  I think it must be an exponetial progression because even though 1.9 is half of 4 it isn't the same as smoking 10 cigarettes a day.  The big things that need to be fixed are a new water heater, water pressure when the toilet flushes (which takes about 15 minutes to refill) is next to nothing.  The seller has agreed to fix this.  The roof will need to be replace within 3 years, 5 years if we vent the attic which needs to happen regardless.  Hand rails need to be installed on all stairs, which the seller is installing.  The furnace is past it's prime, but still works very well.  The inspector turns on the heat high and in 5 minutes it was uncomfortably hot.  And it was about 40 degrees (f) outside.  The gutters need cleaning, and gutter guards attached.  Painting needs to happen.  Which brings me to the appraisal.  The appraisal is different than the inspection.  It covers similar things, but not as in deapth.  One thing they look for is lead-based paint.  The appraiser said there is no need for a  required  repainting as the facing paint is not lead-based.  However there could be lead-based paint under the facing paint, so since the paint is peeling we will need to repaint this coming spring/summer.  And we will have to bear the cost.  In our original deal, the seller was to pay 6000$ to repaint, but only if required.  So now we foot the bill.  The upside is that we also met the bank guy.  He mentioned a new financing option that gives us money back at closing, and gets the seller to replace the plumbing and install handrails.  Cool.  This thing called  urlLink Ameridream  is a charity that the seller gives 3.75% of the purchase price to.  They in turn keep the .75% and give us the 3%.  Crazy.  I think it should be tax-deductible for the seller, too.  So that 3% is what we would be paying in closing costs, and since we already gave 500$ in earnest money, we get that back plus a bit extra.  And we locked in at 6% fixed rate.  The rate will actually be 6.5% because of the private mortgage insurance (PMI).  But this is doable for us.  And the big thing is that we don't have to have cosigners, which is something we thought we would have to do when we started all this (only a little over a month ago).  December 6th is the closing date, and a house-warming on January 18th.  If we know you, you are invited.  Email  urlLink me  if you want to come.  When I get all the reports, I will scan them, PDF them, and post them here.  The inspector's (not appraiser) report is about 45 pages long.  When I asked him, while signing his 450$ check!, if the place was 'salvageable' he said, "Oh definitely."  So even though there will be some work on the place I think we are getting a good deal.  He said a lot of the things that are wrong wouldn't be wrong if the current homeowners were into fixing things up.   I get the impression they just don't have the time.  Otherwise not much is happening.  Sagan turns 2 in 19 days.  And we get to celebrate in a new house.  Tres cool.

      Well, if we go with this  urlLink FHA loan , a decorating allowance is not an option.  FHA rules are very strict apparently.  So we offered 95.  She countered with 97,5 which was the initial asking price when we first looked at the house.  That's okay.  In our purchase agreement, the seller will be responsible for up to 6000$ in costs for painting.  And we get the portable storage unit that is on the driveway under the carport.  A real win there!  So the inspections for house and radon are on the 11th.  The FHA appraiser (separate from the home inspector, and not at our cost) will look for lead and the seller will have a termite inspection.  If all goes well we should be closing on or before Dec 15th.  Painting probably won't happen until the spring, depending on the weather.  Right now the purchase agreement is with the lawyer (another 200$ from us) to be drawn into a real contract.  We won't have to pay our first mortgage payment until February 1st.  So that will help with the month of January.  I'll give notice on our apartment for move our by the end of December.  So we should have at least 2 weeks to move.  Which is good because it means we can do it ourselves, easily.  I'll be off the last week of December.  Crazy.

      So we made an offer last night.  The seller is asking 97,5 and is adding a 1000$ decorating allowance.  Essentially cash at closing.  Instead of offering a little lower than asking price, we offered 97,5 and asked that the decorating allowance be increased to 2000$.    Another wrinkle (sort of) is that this is an FHA loan.  First Time Home Buyer.  A govt program than has certain restrictions.  One of which is that there will be no lead paint.  Any lead paint must be removed by the seller or the loan won't happen.  Trouble is that this home probably has lead exterior paint (an inspection is forthcoming).  The seller had a repaint job priced at 6000$.  So that's out of her pocket.  She counter-offered with 99,5 (the original asking price when she put it on the market) and agreed then to the 2000$ allowance.  99,5 would increase our monthly payment by 30$.  But 2000$ would mean redoing parts of the kitchen, or all of the bathroom, plus getting a real bed for Sagan.  So our counter-offer is going to be 99,5, plus 3000$ allowance, and the seller only has to pay for the stripping, removal and cleanup of paint, plus priming.  We will take care of painting it.  This is because we have specific colors already picked out for the place, and would save money by painting it ourselves.  So I will call the agent this morning and offer that.  If the seller goes for it, she will probably be saving 500-1000$ off her first counter-offer, even with a 1000$ increase in allowance.  3000$ would mean we could completely redo the bathroom (except tub and tile), get Sagan's bed and some accessories for her room, redo the kitchen including cabinets, sink, and possibly fridge or stove.  We want the bathroom and kitchen to be more on the modern side, and leave the rest of the house (with the exception of paining) untouched.  You might say, "With 3000$?  But how?"  To wit, I would respond: IKEA.  I don't remember if I put a link to  urlLink pictures  of the house.  These were taken by the agent.

      The last post was on Thursday, October 31. I mentioned something about house things being not-so-good. Offers of 10.25% interest rates and all.   Well, on Friday the real estate agent called. Said he knew a guy. It's not what you think.   The guy works at a bank here in town and is working on the loan for the person who owns the home we want. The agent mentioned that this guy has been able to work miracles in the past. And he did for us. We got approved to get a loan for the house we want, and the interest rate is only 5%. (And closing costs with the down payment are only 3% of the purchase price. Crazy) Actually we have a choice. 5% until April 2004, at which point it will change to the market rate (but cannot change more than 1%). It will change every year there after. We can also get a fixed, 30 year 6.5% mortgage.   While there are advantages to a fixed rate, we will be going with the 5%. It means about 100$ less per month, and we will need that because right now we pay for just electric. I've heard we will have to pay for all utilities when we own a home. (Outrageous!) Then, once we get another year or two of good credit, we can refinance to a better fixed rate. Assuming that rates do not sky-rocket over the next two years. We are only 1 to 1.5 years from being 'on track' according to the first bank we talked with. I know that lending places look at different things when looking to underwrite (argh! insurance invades my life!) someone, but if the first bank was conservative, then hopefully by the summer of 2004 we should look good to almost any money place.   So we meet with the agent today to set up the purchase agreement. After that we will set up the inspections: house, radon, and lead. If that all looks good we might be able to close by the end of November. So if anyone (that we know) wants to spend Christmas week (Dec 25-Jan 1) with us, stripping wall paper and painting...   Also, Claire is meeting with the chair of the physics department today.

      Movin' in.  Still have stuff at the old place.  Clothing.  Kitchen stuff.  VCR.  New place is coming together somewhat.  It needs so much cleaning.  It was so dirty when we started moving in!  The first day was nothing but cleaning and moving over the furniture and appliances.  So dirty!  But the good thing is that dirt can be cleaned.    The moving of furniture was interesting.  Easy out, but not easy in.  Mostly because of the appliances.  I asked the previous owners if they had a problem getting their washer/dryer into the basement.  Not a problem they assured me.  I looked at the size of theirs and they were the same as ours.  But apparently what constitutes 'no problem' is taking the molding off the doorway to the basement, taking off the door to the outside, and lifting the appliance over a piece of tile that sticks out just enough to not allow an appliance dolly to go safely down the basement stairs.  And I can tell they did it because on the back of each piece of wood was written the location of which part of the doorway the wood came from.  We started painting Sagan's room yesterday.  Cleaned the walls, put on the primer.  But we will leave it for a few days and focus on finishing the move.  Neither of us like living in two places.  This weekend I hope to finish painting the room and install a new water heater.    The furnace guy is coming today.  I found a service sticker on the furnace that was dated October  1986 .  Hopefully it will just need servicing.  Though I would like to install something more modern, and smaller.  The damn thing is huge!    Claire bought a wallpaper steamer.  Since there is wallpaper in every room (except Sagan's) the cost of buying it and using it whenever we want is nothing compared to the cost/hassle of renting.  And it was only 50$.    Sagan has been pretty moody lately.  I understand.  A lot of changes.  Plus we really don't follow a routine in our house.  We are going to try to do this because it will be important to have one when Claire goes back to  urlLink school  next fall.  Plus it will help us.  Sagan's bday is in 3 days.  Woo!  My daughter (who I have thought of as a 2-year-old for about 4 months) is going to be 2.

      Spent 5 hours at work today.  Good thing I still get paid OT.  Got a lot done actually.  Good thing too, since I have to design and usability something this week!  One week!  And I haven't really looked at the requirements yet.  I think it is only a coupe of screens, but still.  Hope they aren't expecting something wonderful.  Probably just have to do paper prototype too.  Sigh.  That's cool.  Not every project can be full UCD.  Sometimes it just has to be built.  Claire and Sagan went swimming while I worked.  They had fun.  Sagan likes swimming.  Oh, I put new pics up on her site.  Link to the right.  Other than that I am really looking forward to ripping this 70s-style fake wood panneling from the walls of the office.  The room will feel so much bigger!  tres tired.  bed now.

       Too much information running through my brain.   UI specs suck.  I am realizing more and more that I hate doing documentation.  Actually the initial creation of specs is not a problem, it's just keeping up with the changes that seem to happen all the way through testing.  Bleh.  Quote from Steve Fadden (funny guy! (said in the tone Raul Julia used in  Moon Over Parador )), in response to my saying that I design UI because I can't get paid to write poetry:  "Maybe they just don't understand that what you do is poetry."  Aw, shucks, ma'am.  Took the car in.  The new battery will cost 111$!.  This is what I get for getting a pre-2000 VW.  I heard that they did a lot of enginerring so that you needed to service your car with VW parts and fluids.  Could be a lie, but honestly with only one car I can't take the chance.  Sad, but true.

      House warming is on the 25th now.  Sorry to those who bought plane tickets, but wanted to surprise us by showing up. :P  We did get our deposit back.  A little more than we needed to buy Sagan's bed.  Which, according to the warraty, should last until she is 14.  Let's just hope the company doesn't go out of business.  I just realized after looking back over a number of posts that I have a lot of typos.  My apologies.  But I won't fix them.  Two days until the 6th wedding anniversary.  We have Auntie Dawn babysitting so Cliare and I can go on a date to a movie. LOTR, since we haven't seen it.  Oh, and  urlLink Ron Zeno  has similar views on usability.  Seems like a nice guy, too.  And finally, I haven't been so busy at work as I am now in ages.  Good thing I still get paid for OT.  The amount of OT I get on the next pay check should take care of our mortgage payment.  Crazy busy.  Baby.  Oh, and I love Sagan.  When her bed is delivered tomorrow, her room will be complete!  Anybody need any writing done?  Creative or otherwise?

      Oy.  01Jan2003.  We are finally out of the apartment.  It is very clean now.  It is nice to have it over and done with (except for Claire's planters).  Hopefully we can get our deposit back.  It will buy us a new fridge.  Nice also to only live, physically and mentally, in one place.  We spent most of the day futzing around.  Claire and I took turns painting Sagan's room.  Sagan is really a pian lately.  Though that may be because she has some unknown virus (maybe) that has evidenced itself through a skin rash.  The doctor says, "It's probably something mild.  This happens in winter."  Whatever.  Now all we have to do is find places for everything.  We do have more room now, but it is all scrunched becuase there's nothing in Sagan's room or the attic.  So it's just a bunch of crap everywhere.    Guess that's all for now.  I just have to finish my application to grad school.  Now that we are moved I can concentrate on that.  Oh yeah, and work.

      Woo!  Let's tap the permanent fund instead of living within our means!  An ADN  urlLink article  on how G-Murkowski wants to take hundreds of millions per year from the fund to pay for the things the State of Alaska should be able to pay for anyway.  It's called a budget.  You live within your means.  Why is it that when people don't pay their bills, collection agencies get on your ass?  But when the government doesn't pay it's bills, it gets to keep running anyway.  I wish I could do that.  Just keep spending even though I don't have any money.

      Got my tshirt today.  Many thanks to  urlLink cockeyed.com .  I chose the Victimless Pranks shirt, which I will wear when I play volleyball.  I know you needed to know that.  I am on this earth to illuminate.  In fact, I coulda been a bohdisattva but they wanted someone taller.

      A friend forwarded this via email today.� Relating to usability, I'd file this under schema.  ~~~~~~~~~  (Adapted from a Jan/Feb 2003 Utne article by Lawrence LeShan, which in turn was adapted from his book "The Psychology of War: Comprehending Its Mystique and Its Madness")  There are startling differences in the ways we perceive reality during wartime compared to peacetime.  (1) PEACETIME: Good and Evil have many shades of gray.� Many groups with different ideas and opinions are legitimate. WARTIME: Good and Evil are reduced to Us and Them.� There are no innocent bystanders; there are only those for or those against us.� Crucial issues are divided into black and white, and opinions about them are either right or wrong.  (2) PEACETIME: Now is pretty much like other times. WARTIME: Now is different from all other times.� Everything hangs in the balance; whoever wins now wins forever.� It is the time of the final battle between good and evil.  (3) PEACETIME: The great forces of nature, such as God or human evolution, are not often evoked in our disputes. WARTIME: "God is on Our Side," "History will absolve us," and other such slogans indicate our belief that the great cosmic forces are with us.  (4) PEACETIME: When this present period is over, things will go on much as they have in the past. WARTIME: Everything will be vastly different after the war.� Things will be better if we win and terribly worse if we lose.� Winning or losing will change the meaning of the past and the shape of the future.  (5) PEACETIME: There are many problems to be solved and their relative importance varies from day to day.� Life is complex. WARTIME: There is only one major problem to be solved.� All others are secondary.� Life has one major focus.  (6) PEACETIME: All people act from pretty much the same motives. WARTIME: THEY act from a wish for power.� WE act from self-defense, benevolence, and reasons of common decency and morality.  (7) PEACETIME: Problems start on different levels--economic, political, or personal--and must be dealt with on those levels.  WARTIME: The real problem started with an act of will by the enemy and can only be solved by breaking his will or by making him helpless to act on it.  (8) PEACETIME: We are concerned with what causes the problems we're trying to solve. WARTIME: We are not concerned with causes, only with outcomes.  (9) PEACETIME: We can talk to those who disagree with us. WARTIME: Since the enemy is evil, he naturally lies.� Communication is not possible.� Only force can settle the issue.� WE tell the truth (news, education).� THEY lie (propaganda).  (10) PEACETIME: All people are fundamentally the same. WARTIME: The same actions are "good" when we do them and "evil" when the enemy does them.� There is doubt that "we" and "they" really belong to the same species.

      Without going too deep into why D&D has affected my life so much, let me just say I hope I roll a 30 in the next 2 weeks.  Some how I keep ending up in these situations where I have 2 weeks to design something.  It wouldn't be so bad if I was only working on one thing at a time, but I am usually on at least 3 projects at a time.  The positive side is that this time I was actually involved in the requirements analysis.  The down side is that I think there is more to the application than I can design in 2 weeks.  I know I can come up with the designs for the new functionality, but since I talked the PM into redesigning the whole application on top of doing the new functionality, it would be good to have that done too.  Bleh.  Too much to do.  Have to finish my performance review documentation.  Talk about all the accomplishments I had based on the goals I set this time last year.  Have to figure out what a new project is doing.  Have to follow up with the project I got a couple of weeks ago which was another "you have 2 weeks" project.  That project I didn't have the familiarity with the requirements that I have on the current one.  So perhaps that bodes well.  Of course I could get caught up in thinking about it too much, where I didn't have that option on the last project.  That's right!  I also have to work on my homework for the class I am in at work.  Huzzah.  I think I am finally being pushed into an area that is making me realize I am just not as smart as I thought I was.  Meh.  Guess I'll just have to get smarter.  Quickly.  Hey, look at  urlLink this  today and smile.

       urlLink Amazon Light 2.0b  is up and running.  Produced by  urlLink Kokogiak .  It is a version of  urlLink Amazon.com  that focuses (I think) more on usability, and less on selling.  But it actually uses XML from Amazon, so the searches you do on Amazon Light are against Amazon's actual db of products.

      I was talking with Steve Fadden recently.  I remarked to him that blogs (especially community blogs, which I wish I could make this one open for everyone to post) are a bit like MUSHing, MUDing and the like.  Confined (usually) to a topic.  A sense of belonging.  Text-driven (I realize there are photo blogs out there).  So I got to thinking about my MUSHing days (10 years ago!) on PernMUSH, Belior Rising, the toocool, yet doomed  urlLink Desert Wings MUSH  (hey it was 1996!).  I still have some TinyMUSH code on my computer.  Don't have my random poetry generator though.  Tres sad.  Anyway.  No point really.  I am just starting to get reaquainted with the Internet on a social level.  And surprise, surprise...  everything is different, yet the same.  So welcome to the world of multi-user shared hallucinations!  Or what Oscar Wilde might have termed, Bunburying.  Cause while this is me typing, the online me is a little bit different than the RL me.  @set me=@whee!

      Hey.  Love usability?  Hate usability?  Capable of writing?  Enjoy butternut squash?  One of the many things I do do is edit for a mag called  urlLink User Experience .  I am always looking for articles from the masses.  You.  Specifically.  Topics range from issue to issue, but as you might suspect it revolves around usability.  Let  urlLink me  know if you are interested in writing about any studies, work, success stories, horror stories, etc.  Oh, and !happy v-day.

      I cannot resist any longer.  Donny Rumsfeld ("let the record show that the witness made the 'drinky-drinky' motion") is one of this country's leaders.  As such, he needs as much "sending up" as Bush.  I appropriated the photo a couple of years ago (maybe even in 2000) and added the text.  I am not an actual Merry Prankster, but I do what I can with what I have.  The  urlLink picture  is 70k.  Sorry, but it just looked better at 256 colors.  Uh-tee, ah say, uh-tee-hee.

      Alaska's current Governor is beginning his run for president in 2008.  This prognostication would be welcome to be proved wrong, but is based on the following Anchorage Daily News  urlLink article  on G-Murkowski's ideas for opening ANWR.  If he can open it for Bush, perhaps he can be a shoe-in for the GOP nomination.  It would certainly put Alaska's erstwhile (though can you be totally erstwhile when your daughter has your previous job?) Representative's name out in front of the  urlLink Outside  public.  Which is why he is starting now by suggesting that the  urlLink Permanent Fund  be used to pressure companies that the fund invests in to lobby Congress on behalf of the good people of AK (well, 50.1% of them anyway).

      Originally posted on  urlLink SVN .  I feel strange.  I didn't find out about it until about 1pm EST.  We don't have TV.  Turned on the radio to NPR to get some info.  Went online to try and see something.  But the major online sources want to charge for viewing streams.  Got an MSNBC stream, but it was very low quality.  The strange part is that, while I do think it is bad news, I don't really feel much about it.  I don't think it has anything to do with the over stimulation of September 11th.  Before the Challenger accident happened, every shuttle launch seemed to capture people's imagination.  I remember we used to watch each launch in school.  And we watch the Challenger.  And we watched the first launch after the Challenger.  But for a long time now I would hear something like, "The shuttle docked with the space station today," and think, "The shuttle went up?"  I just haven't paid attention to it for a long time.  Maybe it is because there is just to much to try to pay attention to these days.  I don't know.  I am not being callous.  I do feel bad for the families left behind.  After reading some of the bios, I do think that these were exceptional people.  But I just don't feel all that bad.  Maybe I will in a few days.  Dunno.  But I do not think we should stop going up.  Perhaps we should try launching something a little less fragile, but we need to explore what we can see.  As high as the stars, as deep as the ocean.  Rightly, they should pause the program and investigate, but they shouldn't stop altogether.  Take this sad opportunity to redesign.  Speaking of redesign... I listened to an interview with Alex Roland on NPR this morning.  He's long been critical of NASA (supportive of space exploration).  An interesting  urlLink interview .

      When you work in a corporation that develops software, everything seems to be about how the system works.  The user is second.  If the app works "on my machine" it should work for everyone.  And it does.  You double-click to open the app and it appears on your screen.  You may or may not know what to do next depending on how much the development team looked at user needs.  I watch the way people talk in meetings during the product lifecycle.  System, system, system.  I am there to remind them that if the  people  for whom they are developing this product cannot use said product, then they have created a piece of crap.  I tend not to use the word crap, unless the project is an overhaul of an existing product.  So there I am, the User Interface Designer.  I am not entirely happy with that title though.  I practice User-Centered Design.  Not happy with that title either.  Nothing I do fits neatly within the methodology of software development.  And that is sad.  But like I said, I watch the way people talk in meetings.  And the other day, as I was watching, I realized what part of the problems was.  I don't do "devspeak," and the developers don't speak UCD.  And neither of us should have to.  But the one thing everyone talks about (or the way they talk about things) is, "Suppose something like this happens...  I want to find a file, so I go to the homepage, click the file attachments link, look at the list, find the one I want, click on it and there it is."  And I nod, saying, "That's how we intend the interaction to work."  So I think, I shouldn't be a User Interface Designer, I should be an Interaction Designer.  And there are plenty of people in the "industry" who have Interaction Designer as a title.  But, I still think that is too industry-centric.  So I think again, "What did he just describe?"  A scenario.  Scenario-based Design.  But I don't want to be a Scenario-based Designer.  I think I still like Interaction Designer as a job title, but I am liking Scenario-based Design as a substitute for User-Centered Design more and more.  Too much software has been developed as a collection of functionality.  And over the years, if that piece of software has survived the many trials and tribulations that software often goes through, that functionality turns into a collection of things to do.  I think that software development needs to focus more on solving problems, rather than provide functionality.  The people who build this stuff talk in the mode of scenarios in order to explain to each other what they expect the system to be able to do.  I talk in scenarios about what the user should be able to accomplish.  So, Scenario-based Design.  In my happy place, no business requirements are allowed to be gathered until the scenarios of use are defined.  These would invariably produce business requirements.  But the scenarios would be built by a team that included an Interaction Designer, a Business Analyst, and a Developer.  This small team would look at feedback from the current product; conduct user interviews; look at click-streams, onpage times et al.  Then they would sit down and come up with a list of things than need solutions.  The users are having problems with A.  The users want to be able to do B.  The list would essentially be a bunch of narratives on what should be provided by the functionality in scenario form.  It would have a bit of high level goals of the users.  It would have a bit of the business information.  It would have some suggestions as to the functionality.  But it would be something that everyone on the project team could get their mind around.  This group could relatively quickly figure out whether anything actually needs to be done.  If they couldn't come up with any scenarios, or the scenarios they did come up with didn't fit the direction of the business needs, no project would be initiated.  Today we have Charters, and Scope Descriptors, and Plans that are all separate documents and are usually put together by someone who won't actually be on the project, or that doesn't have any experience with user, business, or system issues.  And too much time is spent trying to fit functionality (separate from purpose) into the scope, which may or may not be what actually gets done on the project.  I have been on too many projects that spend 600 hours at (conservatively) 80$ per hour to find out that another project was scoped to do the same work.  Or that the cost of doing the work would be too high so the project is stopped.  A scenario-based process would also help with the badly needed fragmenting of software development.  Instead of a project building a tool for a user group, you look at the scenarios of use and see how they apply across the enterprise.  Then you design a solution to that usage scenario that all of a sudden many user groups can have access to.  Yikes, I am writing a lot.  I should get back to my non-scenario, non-solution world of work.  This idea still needs so work, but I think I am getting close to a good idea.  But will I change the world with it?  Dunno.  Is this taking place elsewhere?  Let  urlLink me  know.

      I realize that survey's, polls and the like often mean next to nothing.  However, this  urlLink one  amuses me.  The Murkowski Two are not doing well in this recent poll.   urlLink G-Murkowski  (the former S-Murkowski) and  urlLink S-Murkowski  (the former little s-murkowski) are sliding in the opinion polls.  This doesn't surprise me.  G-Murkowski went back to AK, waltzed in, and expected to have the same influence that he had in the Senate.  Well Alaskans, as I assume most people, do not like being told what to do.  And that seems to be G's modus."This is how it's gonna be, if you don't like it, think of something better or we're going with my plan.  You have five minutes."

      I have been reading quite a few blogs and commercial news sites over the last few days.  On the blogs, everyone seems depressed.  Now, I realize that I initially linked to a somewhat (okay  very ) liberal blog, which then led me to other liberal blogs.  Generally speaking I would say that liberals oppose war.  Generally speaking.  I would like to see some conservative blogs; see how they are "taking" the war.  Maybe the Pope has a blog.  I'd consider him a conservative.  Oh wait.  He opposes the war.  So what's up with all those Catholics?  There's a lot of them.  Why do many support the war?  I was reading  urlLink skimble  tonight.  He(?) has a link to a site that shows some graphic photos from the victims of the war.  Military and civilian.  One of the kids looks kinda like Sagan.  Not realy, but she has those little teeth with big gaps between each tooth.  I don't want to link directly to the photos, because they are disgusting.  And that's not the only thing that disgusts me.  Mr. Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld...  your revenge-lust is not just.  Sadly, none of these warmongers will ever face any sort of punishment for their crimes.  The commercial news outlets do not want to cover news.  They regurgitate what the government lets them.  In a lot of ways this country is a constitutional monarchy.  The only difference is that the national leaders aren't (usually) related to previous leaders.  They just all went to the same schools.  Their families summer together.  Most Americans look the other way when it comes to our government.  That would be me, too.  I have mentioned before how difficult it was to get involved in  local  politics.  I think the system is set up so that only those with connections or a great amount of ambition to get connections can be "in" the system.  I feel out-of-control when it comes to my involvement in this country.  I think "they" want it that way.  Actually, I just looked through my archives.  I never posted how difficult it was to get into local politics.  I really thought I did.  So, the following is the back and forth I had with the editorial page editor:   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Apparently, not only do the requirements vary, but no office seems to know all of the open positions.  Whether it is by city, county, or state.  I think this is strange.  Your editorial said, "consider getting involved in this important public service," but the process is so cumbersome (and seemingly still set up in the "it's who you know" manner) that I am not surprised at the small amount of involvement.   I don't think I'll make the deadline on Tuesday, because I cannot find out what is available for me in which to participate.  Someone at the Bloomington library took my name and address (but not phone number or email address) to "pass along to the mayor and tell her of your interest."   Maybe it's a good thing.  Allowing the general populace to demonstrate civil responsibility might muck things up for those currently in charge.   Thanks, though, for your initial follow up.   -----Original Message----- From: bwills@pantagraph.com [mailto:bwills@pantagraph.com] Sent: Friday, 17 January, 2003 11:31 AM To: Matthew Oliphant Subject: Re: "Don't overlook chance to serve on special boards" Editorial   The requirements for the boards vary so much that the best thing to do is call the entity in which you are interested.  For example, if you are interested in the Normal Library Board, please call the library.  We didn't put petiton specifics in our editorial because the requirements vary so much throughout our Central Illinois reading area.  I hope this helps.

Thanks.   _________________________________  Matthew Oliphant  interface designer et al.                                      From the online editorial  :   "Pantagraph Editorial  Friday, January 17, 2003  Don't overlook chance to serve on special boards  In a democracy, the importance of voting is frequently emphasized -- as it should be. But, voters also need someone for whom to vote. There's still time to get on the ballot for the April 1 election.   The filing deadline has passed for the city councils in Normal and Bloomington. However, the deadline for many other boards in the April 1 consolidated election is Tuesday.   These include boards overseeing schools, community colleges, libraries, parks and fire protection districts.  Many of these boards do not have as high a profile as city councils, but they are no less important. Indeed, it could be argued that such board members play an even more crucial role because, with the public not watching as intently, board members must be particularly vigilant to protect constituents' interests.   The process is not difficult. For example, candidates for the Normal library board need only 50 signatures on a nominating petition. School board candidates also need only 50 signatures.   Consider getting involved in this important public service."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Bleh, at work on a Sunday.  And the weather is so nice out.  Claire and Sagan are at home working on the garden.  Well, Claire is working, Sagan is "helping."  There is a house across the street that is for sale.  It has been changed from a house to 2 apartments and an efficiency.  The seller only wants 65k$ for it.  It looks like it needs a ton of work, but for only 40k$, you could turn it into a nice rentable place.  And you would still have only spent 100k$, in a neighborhood that is nice.  Granted, we are on the edge of the neighborhood, but it is still nice.  So maybe Claire's mom will buy in and fix it up.  Ugh, back to documentation.  My favourite part of the job.

      I have quite a few posts below on a class that I just took.  If your company has interface designers, usability people, human factors researchers (or whatever the title du jour is), I highly recommend you contact  urlLink Dr. Bob Bailey  to take his  urlLink User Interface Update  class.  It is a 3-day course that looks at the HCI research of the past year with a critical eye.  Some of it is good, a lot of it is bad.  The class also teaches you how to interpret these studies, as well as give you some tools for your own work.  The class is given every year, and Dr. Bailey is a great speaker.

      A paper ( urlLink abstract ) on remote testing versus in-lab testing by Tom Tullis, et al. from Fidelity Investments in Boston.  One of the interesting things on this is that the subjective ratings (preference questions) were scored lower in the remote testing.  In other words, people were more critical when they didn't take time out of their day to come to a nice lab, meet nice people, and be nice all day.  Another thing was that between the two tests only 11 of the same usability issues were found.  26 were found in-lab, and 16 were found in the remote.  So if 11 were the same and the preference data was more critical, is remote testing better?  They did a second test that only found 7 similar usability issues.

      Marilyn Hughes Blackmon, Peter G. Polson, Clayton Lewis, and Muneo Kitajima:   urlLink Cognitive Walkthrough for the Web (CWW) .  Dr. Bailey said, [paraphased] "This paper was dificult to summarize, and then I realized these people are way ahead of what you and I are doing today."  CWW simulates users performing navigation tasks on a Web site by assuming that users perform goal-driven exploration.  It uses contextually rich desription of user goals (usually 100-200 words), which is different from saying, "The user will find the checkout information."  Assumes that generating an action is a two-step process.  1) Parsing a new page into sub-regions and attenting to the correct sub-region, and 2) Selecting a widget from the attended sub-region and acting on it.  This is an interesting study.  They use Comprehension-based Linked model of Deliberate Search (CoLiDes) (how's that for an acronym), which assumes that problem solving processes drive users' information seeking behaviors when exploring a new Web site, or carrying out a novel task on a familiar site.  Users perceive similarity between their goals and the descriptions within alternative regions or actions.  The similarities can be calculated by  urlLink Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).   You can go to the LSA site to use some of their  urlLink tools .

The study looked at Heuristic Evaluations, Cognitive Walkthroughs, and Think-aloud Evaluations.  Guess what!  All three methods do a lousy job at finding usability problems.  Even when a team of evaluators uses two or more of the methods for the same system.  Doesn't seem to matter if you are a novice or expert evaluator, whether you're looking for cosmetic or severe porblems, or simple or complex system.  The gist of it (as usual) is that it is difficult for usability evaluators to agree on what is a problem.

      Talking about reading speeds on paper and monitors.  With studies that date back all the way to 1881 on Tinker and Paterson.  Now talking about  urlLink ClearType .  Apparently there is not much of a reliable difference between user reading performance.  Ya know what?  There's just too much in this class to document.

      I'll just post as the class goes to each break.  Easier that way.  Talking now about usability's Return on Investment (ROI).  One study from Stephanie Rosenbaum presented at UPA 2002.  and a link to a  urlLink site  that tracks ROI postings on the Web.  Now on to the  urlLink IUSR  project from  urlLink NIST .  Also talking about the use of the Common INdustry Format for usability reporting.  Much of this is based on  urlLink ISO  standards (specifically ISO 9241).  Here's a  urlLink site  that is very descriptive about ergonomic standards.  Now talking about Card Sorting for the  urlLink usability.gov , of which Dr. Bailey is a contributor.  They created a program to randomize 20 decks of cards (each deck has 187 cards).  The participants put those cards in order and category which they thought was logical.  Pretty typical card sorting, but I would like to see the tool they created as the one  urlLink IBM  offers for free is not exactly user friendly (even though it helps with computing the data you gather from the card sort).  But then Bailey says that they used the IBM tool to create a cluster analysis.

      In  urlLink Dr. Bailey's  class today.  User Interface Update looks at many of the papers that were published in the last year relating to human factors, usability, and such.  The first paper is from  urlLink UCLA .  The next one came up in the  urlLink CHI 2002  proceedings.  A paper from Karel Vrendenburg, Paul W. Smith, Ji-Ye Mao, and Tom Carey, "A Survey of User-Centered Design."  The study relied on survey results given to attendees of CHI 2002, and all the members of  urlLink UPA .  Not usre how good of a study it was with only a 3% response rate.  This would be of (my estimate) about 1200 people.  Then we did something about the Golden Ratio (which I think has something to do with  urlLink Fibonacci .  Now it's time for a break.

      Updated/added some links to the right.  At work on a Saturday.  Again.  Working on a prototype for usability on Monday and Tuesday.  The scenarios are all set, we (one of the developers is here too, go Annie!) just need to plug in some realistic fake data, and make sure all the links work.  Not a big deal.  But I also need to work on some UI specs for another project.  Again, not a big deal, but it is a lot of typing.  Thankfully I don't have to do as much as I thought because I am just making sure the screens are compliant with the latest style guide.  So I can grab the documentation from the previous project (that happened about 2 years ago), do a copy & paste, then make the updates.  Thanks to Sharon Witter for some decent spec'ing the first time around.  Steve Fadden comes in for an interview on Monday.  I hope he gets the job/takes the job.  It would be nice to have someone out here that I know.  Even though we've never met in person. :)  Haven't heard from Frank lately.  Frank?  You out there?

      A  urlLink CNN online article  (actually an AP article) wrties about how the US Senate is one vote away from passing legislation to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil drilling.  Please speak out (or type out), and do it today!  I sent the following to quite a few Senators.  Focus on Sens. BLanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Gordon Smith of Oregon, and Norm Coleman of Minnesota.  Also send to your state's Senators.  Feel free to use it, or something similar, if you oppose drilling in ANWR.  ~~~ Please do not vote to open ANWR to oil drilling.  I lived in Alaska for 21 years, and while I know there are Alaskans that feel it should be opened, I know there are many that do not believe it should be opened.  Now I am a resident of Illinois, and my feelings haven't changed.  I believe the risks of being wrong about the potential dangers of drilling outweigh the benefits of the oil that we may find.  I do not feel that there is actual overwhelming support for opening ANWR.  And even if there was overwhelming support I believe that the desires of the population as they stand today do not warrant always being satisfied.  People just have to change sometimes, and it is up to the elected leaders to help manage that change.  I hope you will vote against this issue, and encourage your colleagues to vote against it as well. ~~~

      Why America's government cracks me up.  This is an article from the Associated Press:  ~~~ THE ASSOCIATED PRESS       WASHINGTON -- Show the flag and pass the ketchup was the order of the day in House cafeterias Tuesday. Lawmakers struck a lunchtime blow against the French and put "freedom fries" on the menu.      And for breakfast they will now have "freedom toast."      The name changes follow similar actions by restaurants around the country protesting French opposition to the administration's Iraq war plans.      "Update. Now Serving in All House Office Buildings, 'Freedom Fries,' " read a sign that Republican Reps. Bob Ney of Ohio and Walter Jones of North Carolina placed at the register in the Longworth Office Building food court.      Jones said he was inspired by Cubbie's restaurant in Beaufort, N.C., in his district, one of the first to put "freedom fries" on the menu instead of french fries.      Ney, whose panel oversees House operations, ordered the menu changes.      Officials at the French Embassy pointed out that french fries actually come from Belgium.      "We are at a very serious moment dealing with very serious issues and we are not focusing on the name you give to potatoes," said Nathalie Loisau, an embassy spokeswoman.  ~~~  The people who do this kind of stuff are stupid, whinney babies.  "I'll show you, I'll rename something that you made.  Even if you didn't make it."  Go "Freedon Dressing."  Can we get a law passed that schools have to teach the "Freedom" language?  Oh, wait.  That might backfire.  Because if you replace "Freedom" for "French" and everyone knows you did that, then they might associate the French with the idea of Freedom.  And doesn't America have the trademark on freedom?  Well, maybe "freedumb."

      Sent in the last bits of my application for grad school in the University of Illinois Library and Information Science program.  Nice to have it done with.  Now I just wait to hear from them.  I did miss the deadline though.  For some reason when I read the deadline I saw March 15, not March 1.  So I put that on my calendar.  Then I was on the UI site on Feb 28 and saw my mistake.  Yeah, not so good on the reading comprehension!   Anyway, here is what I wrote for my essays:   Visit a library, community network, corporate information center, or other setting that employs information professionals (except your current place of employment).  Interview a staff member to identify the three most significant issues related to information services in this setting.  In your essay, discuss what you learned, including:  1.	What questions did you ask? 2.	Did you learn anything unexpected?  Anything that changed you review of the library and information science profession? 3.	How do you think your educational experience at GSLIS might prepare you to address the issues you identified?    My mother retired in 1993 as head librarian for the Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska.  When I took up this assignment, I compared the answers I received from my interviewee to the things I remember from the �goings-on� of the library administration in Anchorage; the politicking, private meetings, budget woes, and lack of staff.  In pursuit of my query to finish this essay, I went out into the cold, cruel world to a nice coffee shop to interview Matthew Kubiak, director of the Bloomington, Illinois public Library.  From the interview, I realized not much has changed even with the information technology boom that happened after my mother retired.  Not much has changed because public libraries can�t afford to be a part of the boom at the same level as a corporate, or university library, and politics will never go away.  The following is the result of the interview, plus a follow-up questionnaire via email.  MO:  What has been/continues to be the most difficult process/part/issue related to providing information services?   MK:  Resources and funding are most often at the base of it.  There are many ways that this manifests itself.  Such shortcomings have consequences and have many ramifications.  Politics, funding, censorship, the Internet, and MLS salaries continue to be issues that we deal with on a daily basis.  MO:  What are some successes with which you have been involved?  What made it successful?  What challenges were overcome?  MK:  We have been able to establish an excellent management team.  One hires the best people available.  This may surprise you.  I�ve seen safe-choices being hired; folks selected who may be perceived as docile or not smarter, not more knowledgeable, and non-threatening with the knowledge they possess.  However, one needs different points of view and strong personalities in the mix.  When one is in place 15 years, the opportunities come to select the best from the applicant pool.   I�ve been fortunate in this respect.  In addition, the staff in place has been encouraged to develop and most have.  I feel that this is the base for success.  They chose this (LIS) profession, and they don�t want to stagnate.  That�s the key.  We can make a difference.  We can drive the organization and the process.  We initiate.  We create our future.  Things don�t just happen to the library.    Probably the greatest challenge was to take a library that was perceived as successful and redirect just a little bit some of the workplace culture.  The challenge now is move forward as an institution after the resignation of the board president and after a new building plan (three, intense years in the creation) has been put on hold.    There have been many successes.  We have a partnership with the Boys and Girls Club.  Adult programming has become a major bragging point.  We recently received an Illinois First Grant to build a computer lab.  BPL staff developed the Tale for Two Cities program, in coordination with the Normal Public Library.  Our Project Next Generation (PNG), a state funded computer initiative for at-risk-youth, is recognized as the best in the state.  The spin-offs and partnerships that have come from PNG are great.    A number of departments have been streamlined and overhauled from the inside; from the bottom up.  Our reference questions continue to grow, annually, and of late, we have been able to increase of circulation numbers.  We�ve placed special emphasis on good customer service.    I cannot remember when the last time was that BPL didn�t have a staff member attending library school.  Twelve or so years ago, we initiated a program with citizens in the five other townships to form a public library district which contracts with BPL for library services: all the service without the overhead.     Overall, this was an interesting exercise.  I appreciate the opportunity to �get out� and come to a better understanding of the LIS field.  This essay requirement is a nice change from the normal, �tell us why you will choose us� essay.  I plan to follow the Management and Consulting for Information Systems and Services concentration.  I believe this will help me to understand and work within the constraints, specifically politics and funding, mentioned above.  I already have some informal background in change management, leadership, and information design.  Pursuing this degree will allow me to take my skills and competencies to the next level.  I don�t mean that in a corporate-manager-speak way either.  I feel ready for a challenge that will allow me to test what I know, learn more, and create more professional opportunities than I currently have.    In addition, please submit a one-page essay concerning your pervious academic work in your proposed or allied fields of study, including course work, other educational experiences, teaching or relevant employment, publications, and your plans for graduate study and a professional career.   My mother sent me an envelope filled with newspaper clippings, as she is often wont to do.  There is never a note as to why I would find anything she sends relevant of course, but that is part of the fun of discovery.  Last fall she sent a clipped ad from a magazine promoting the LEEP program.  I had just recently stopped pursuing the idea of going back to school because I would have to quit my job to do it.  Library and Information Science was, quite honestly, not even in my mind as a possibility.  However, when I read the ad, something just clicked.    My Bachelor�s degree was in Liberal Studies with an emphasis in writing.  The only thing from the degree that prepares me for graduate study is that, �with a liberal studies degree, you can do anything,� as one of my professors was apt to say.  This is the gift and curse for the liberal studies degree-wielding graduate.  I can do anything, so what do I choose?  After graduating five years ago, I find myself ensconced in corporate culture, designing user interfaces for Web applications.  I started out in State Farm as a technical writer (mostly developing Help), and then quickly moved into interface design.  I have taken many company-sponsored classes in human-computer interaction:  �	Web and Interface Design from Dr. Susan Weinschenk   �	User Interface Specialist Training and annual user interface updates from Dr. Robert Bailey   �	Cognitive Walkthrough from Dr. Andrew Dillon   �	Interviewing Techniques from Ginny Redish   �	Advanced Usability Evaluation Techniques from Jeff Rubin    I am also a member of ACM/SIGCHI  , UPA  , and STC  .  I helped start the local STC chapter, and I am currently an editorial board member for UPA�s magazine User Experience.  I know that I can bring many of the learning opportunities from the LIS program back into my current job.  However, as I go through the LIS program I will be looking for ways to grow professionally.  I would like to move into information management, focusing on human factor issues.  Not just figuring out ways to organize information, but focus on how people (both groups and individuals) access and more importantly understand the information.  I am also quite interested (perhaps more interested) in teaching/researching at the university level.

      GAH!  I have to write my goals for the coming year of work.  What do I want to be when I am one year older?  And it can't be anything I already do.  They must be stretch goals!  And each time I sit down to write something, I cannot think of anything.  "List your result goal.  What will be measured.  How will it be measured.  What are the competencies needed to acheive the result."  I have to do three and I cannot even think of one.  Any  urlLink suggestions ?

      Writing about G-Mur, I thought I would look up what  urlLink S-Mur  is doing these days.  Following is an excerpt from a press release from her office:   "Wild salmon from the  pristine  waters of Alaska are as close to 'natural' or 'organic' as any product of any type anywhere. Alaska salmon is as wholesome, if not more, than any other organic product on the market. It is hard to believe that some in the government don�t believe wild-caught natural salmon from Alaska are �organic,� but are supportive of organic labeling for farm-raised salmon �- which  could  contain contaminants not present in wild fish. This amendment will help consumers gain balanced and complete information on the food they buy," Murkowski said.   How will it help?  Let's go find the amendment...    Okay, very hard to find anything on senate.gov.

Why, you might be inclined to ask?  Thar's oil in them thar... um... grounds?  Anyway, I suppose if the roads are there they'll just have to drill for oil.  And if that  urlLink goes through , well golly... lucky for G-Mur there aint any trees for the liberals to chain themselves to.

      Well, not so groovy news.  I didn't get into  urlLink UIUC's   urlLink LIS Program .  I don't have the denial letter with me right now (I am at work on the weekend again!) but I will post it tonight or tomorrow.  I don't think I realized how much I wanted to go back to school until Claire put the envelope in my hands.  It was too thin for a acceptance letter.  I said, "Well, crap."  Crap.  Now I am looking to go to  urlLink ISU  as a  urlLink Student-at-Large  to begin with and work toward a Masters there.  I might reapply at UIUC next year.  Not sure.  It's too late to officially aply to ISU as a Masters student.  So Student-at-Large it is.  My friend Dawn did that last year.  She works a few cubes down from me.  She even got permission from our boss to take a day class.  She still did the 40-50 week, but every Tuesday and Thursday from 11:30-2:30 she was in class.  I will see if I can do that too.  Here are the majors that are of varying interest to me (in alpha order).  I opened it up to general interests as I am not sure I want to stay with Information Science/HCI stuff.  I may still but I want to start with many options.              urlLink Accounting       urlLink Art, School of       urlLink Arts Technology       urlLink Economics       urlLink English            urlLink Philosophy     urlLink Politics and Government     urlLink Psychology     urlLink Technology     urlLink Theatre, School of

      Woo.  32 years and 1 day.  Someone at work asked if I was hitting the big 2-5.  Um, I don't think I look that young.  They were very suprised when I said 32.  "I guess it's because I act like a child."  Ah, and a new foible with my Web site.  I cannot FTP files.  So the only updates that are being made are this blog.  For som reason the app I use for FTP (RBrowserLite) can connect to Verizon, but not display any files.  I tried fetch too.  I know the files are still there, but I have no access.  And I have long forgotten how to access through a command line processor.  I am able to log in through Apple's Terminal app, and do a dir command, but I can't remember how to do the ftp.  Ugh.  And Verizon says that the Web site is a free feature through my DSL, so they don't offer support for any of it.  Only that their engineers are aware of the problem and are working to fix it.  @whee.

I'll save for it, but my bonus will go to debt reduction, paying for Claire's school, and maybe a mobile phone/service for her, since she'll be on campus quite a bit.  Let  urlLink me  know if you know of a good service.  Not Sprint.  I already know they suck.  I will allow myself 100$.  Of which I will probably actually spend 75$ on me.  That is more reasonable.  Just need to make more money.  Maybe the  urlLink Steak 'n' Shake  is hiring...

      Jakob Nielsen says  urlLink something  I agree with.� Though he has to use analogies to do it.� Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Thing is, for me, there's no question that usability will be done (at least once) on a project.� So I guess I live in an ivory tower on this, and many design/usability-related points.

      As usual, synchronicity is playing a major hand in my life.� I used to be able to see patterns in actions and events, then make cognitive leaps as to the eventual outcome.� (Yeah, I just got lucky.:P)  But now I only seem to be able to notice things when I am sick.� And, oh baby, am I sick now.� I hate colds.� But that's not the point of this post.� I read four unrelated posts on usability blogs this morning.  1) A post on self-reliance at  urlLink The Elegant Hack  2) A post on relationships and compromise at  urlLink Peterme.com  3) A post on Usability no longer Differentiates at  urlLink Diary of a Superfluous Man   4) A comment on the above by  urlLink Ron Zeno  which states the following:� "From my understanding of usability, no one is able to demonstrate they are able to consistently produce usable products. So, discussing going beyond this is just idle speculation at best, and statements like 'Everybody agrees that the products we design should be usable.' are meaningless when people don't know how to make them usable."  This is why I (and many others) think that usability does work, probably.� I think usability (testing) and user/human-centered design work part way.� If we ignore the past because we either hate/fear consistency, or understand that consistency for the sake of consistency can take you only so far, then we ignore opportunities to understand why those past choices were made.� Around here it is called a "Lessons Learned" document which is meant to be passed along to the next project (which of course no one ever reads).  If we follow too much down the path of self-reliance, forgoing all else because it is not in the nature of what is being designed, we again miss an opportunity to better the design based on what worked and what didn't on a previous iteration, or similar product/service.  So then I get to relationships and compromise.� The post on peterme is more about love, but I apply it to design and usability as well.� I think 95% (made up percentage) of what we do as designers/usability testers is relationships and compromise.� I may make a perfect design that fashions itself both after what the user expects to do, and what the business expects them to do, but the technology cannot support it.� So do you wait until technology catches up with what the user needs to do, or do you implement a partial solution?� Business says partial solution.� Designers/usability testers who wish to remain employed agree.  This is why it is so difficult to produce a usable product (based on the objectives for usability of course).� We can design products/services that lift the user to a higher state of well-being, but if it can't be built what is really the point?  The point is what Jonathan at superfluous states:� Usability no longer differentiates.� Users are getting smarter in the mediums designers/usability testers are drawn to.� Technology doesn't keep the same pace.� So we are left with compromise that affects the user in an often unfortunate way.� If it is not effective, efficient, and satisfactory we have (by our own definition) failed.� But I say we only failed that moment.� We immediately start figuring out how not to fail the next time.�  How can we leverage technology to meet the user's needs?� We are the Threshold Guardians.� One foot in the past, one foot in the future, one hand building the relationship between business needs and technology constraints, and one hand lifting up the user.  We cannot do it all at the same time and do it well.� At least I cannot.� So we strive for the best balance possible given the situation.� We aren't able to consistently produce usable products because of this balance.� Business is starting to care more about making usable products/services, but technology still bases success on "it works on my machine."� Users are becoming better users.� Partly because we are gaining ground in helping them, partly because they are gaining more experience with the mediums. (Yes I made a generality statement.)  It always comes down to us, and always will.� My lack of energy because of being sick is clouding my point even more than usual.� I guess I want you to keep trying to build on the success of the past, but be willing to throw it al away for a better design.� Don't agree with, "They did it like this so we have to do it like that for consistency."� Concentrate on building "soft skills" like relationship building, conflict management, change management, and team building.� And do it all with an eye on where you want to be in the future.� Design knowing that this is yet another iteration over a long (hopefully) period of time.� This is the craft part of what we do.� And it is the part we should put most of our energy into getting right.  Screw design techniques.� Screw a better way to presentation through CSS.� Get good at defining the need for change, understanding the desires of the business, technologists, and users, and build the best deliverable you can.  Woo, cold medicine is kicking in.� I'll stop now.

      Three days of UI spec walkthroughs.  Well, not three full days, but enough screens that it was best to split the meetings over three days.  Very draining.  Made it through the first 2/3 of the app with good results.  Only a few changes, and all are steps in the right direction.  The last 1/3 was atrocious.  Turns out there is functionality missing.  Why, this never happens on any other project...  Oh wait, it does.    This is what cracks me up about designing software.  Companies have methodologies comming out of their ass, and yet for all the rigor, business requirements still get "discovered" late in the design phase.  This is the down side of not knowing the domain for which I design.  (I think there are more upsides, but the few downsides are big.)  I can look at the requirements, probe on issues for which I have questions, but I am still limited to what the business analyst defines.  In this case, the issues are confusing to everyone, including the subject matter experts.    Increasingly, I am becoming part business analyst (BA), part developer.  I many ways I have to know more than the BA so I can come to an understanding of what the users will and will not know.  This will drive much of my design decisions.  I also have to be part developer because when I hear, "We can't do that," I need to understand if it is  can't ,  won't , or   don't know how .  I just seems that companies focus so much time, money, and effort (I guess I could have just said money) on development and testing.  But everything leads back to definable, testable business requirements.  BAs may know the job, but they don't seem to know the business.  And most do not know how to write.  I usually get on a project after the scope has been defined, and often after use cases (another poorly implemented exercise) and some business requirements are defined.  But that is usually too late.  And when I get on that project, the first thing out of the project managers mouth is, "I need hours and timelines from you."  How do you figure this out when scope is so shapeless, and requirements are not defined?  Blanket statement: 500 hours.  When  urlLink Alan Cooper  spoke at  urlLink UPA  in 2001 he said, "Good software takes two years to develop."  I agreed with him then (though on most of his other nuggets I said either "Duh," or "Um, no?") and I agree more with him now.  I know there are a couple of issues in this post.   urlLink What do you do in situations like these?

      Two weeks til my birthday!  Two weeks til my birthday!  And nicely it happens two days before I get paid.  A paycheck which has my salary increase, my bonus, and will have quite a bit of OT.  The  urlLink GOV  will eat up a bunch of it, but it should still be enough to warrant the purchase of a new  urlLink iPod  and Canon  urlLink A70 , or  urlLink S30 .  I'd like the S30 because of the L-Ion battery, but the A70 is more in my immediate price range.  But really I should pay off my credit card.  Maybe just the iPod...  So if you want to drop by on my birthday, just let  urlLink me  know.

      Straight from the mouth of  urlLink Alaska's Representative for Life :   "I think the Patriot Act was not really thought out," Young said Friday while meeting with reporters. "I'm very concerned that, in our desire for security and our enthusiasm for pursuing supposedly terrorists, that sometimes we might be on the verge of giving up the freedoms which we're trying to protect."   [ urlLink Source ]  Hm, ya think?  I thought the people we elected were supposed to think about more than just today.  Like how decisions made today will effect "tomorrow."  Silly me.

       urlLink 37Signals  is hiring.  On many levels I wish I could apply for the position.  But, herein lies the problem.  They want to see examples of current work.  And who wouldn't.  But I can't show anything I have designed as it is all proprietary.  This is one thing that sucks about working here.  I am getting great project experience.  Great design experience.  Great usability experience.  I get to research (some, not as much as I would like).  I get constant updates to my training.  Okay, why do I want to leave here?  Mostly because creative solutions are balked at too often here.  Even when I show how things might work it's, "Well, the other area did this so we want to do it that way too."  I am all about consistency, but consistently bad?  No thanks.  Anyway.  I'll just try to make the best of the sitch.  On a related note.  A small (yet talented) design/usability company is hiring.  Perhaps the economic storm is passing?

      While Sagan and I were waiting for Claire to finish an appointment, we walked a bit.  Played in the grass.  "Daddy! Run!"  We were in downtown Normal, along the bike trail.  But, then we walked up the sidewalk and into the parking lot behind the Coffeehouse.  "Go in dere?  Mommy go in dere last night."  Really?  Claire hadn't gone into the Coffeehouse the night before, but Sagan seemed convinced she had.    I have avoided the Coffeehouse ever since I told Simon (the owner) that I coldn't take it anymore.  The place was sucking our lives away.  Claire and I, with the help of Lyndsey and Nella were running the place.  We were being the owners without being the owners.  I'd roast in the morning when I dropped Claire off to bake.  Then the cook wouldn't show up, so I would cook.  And the counter help wouldn't show up so Claire would work the counter.  We soon came to hate the place.  Which was unfortunate since it is the only place in town with a full vegetarian menu and it's own coffee roaster.  So, I begrudingly went along with Sagan.  We went in and I felt nostalgia.  The place was packed and my roaster was sitting there, a little more worse for the wear.  It doesn't look well cared for.  I found myself really missing it, and also dreading running into Simon.  Not that he is there much.  When we left, I was thinking that maybe I am doing the wrong thing with my life.  I really miss being in a cafe.  I miss working with coffee.  Kind of had a, "What the fuck am I doing with my life" moment.    At times like these it is good to remember the words of  urlLink Ian Shoales :  Nostalgia is to memeory what aspirin is to penicillin.

      Going to Susan's graduation in June.   I'll be in Seattle on June 12-13, then to Eugene/Corvallis June 13-15, then back home at 12:55 am on June 16 (really the night of the 15th).  Quick trip, but worth it.  Susan's been working on this PharmD. for a long time now and will soon be able to dole out drugs to anyone who manages to forge a perscription.  Did I say forge? :P  I think I will go to a ball game the night of the 12th.  Seattle vs. Montreal.  Hopefully I will be able to see Megan and Kirstie.  On another note, I think I will not be going back to school until Claire is done with her school.  That will be 5-7 years.  She has waited a long time, both because I was going first and then because she didn't know what she wanted to do.  Now she knows:  urlLink Physics/Engineering .  I think I will still take a few classes here and there.  One in particular that Dawn took last year in the  urlLink Arts Technology  department.  So yeah, a lot of changes over the past year.  Heck!  A lot of changes over the past 5 years.  In May of 1998 we were living in Alaska, I had just finished my degree, and weren't sure what we were going to do next.  Definitely didn't have a baby, nor any desire to have one.  I was working at L'aroma, and Claire was working at a greenhouse.  We had multiple roommates in a house that we couldn't afford to rent on our own.  Never even thought about Illinois, other than to watch the Cubs on TV.  Crazy man.  Now that school is somewhat out of the picture I suppose I should start posting on one of the other topics listed in the meta tag of this site.   urlLink Coffee!   And how are  urlLink you ?

      Yikes.  usabilityworks.org runs out in 12 days.  I'd better renew.  I'll do it tomorrow.  Gotta have money first.  Speaking of money, I think I will be buying some  urlLink music  from Apple this weekend.  Excellent conversation on the pros and cons of the interface and the service at  urlLink Signal vs Noise .  I bought one song the day iTunes 4 premiered.  Bob Dylan.  Very cool.  I also see that they have some Cibo Matto, which I am listening to as I type.  I only have the Stereo Type A album, but iTunes Store has songs from another album, too.  Not all of then, but I think I may get most of what is available.  I also want to get one of  urlLink these  and  urlLink this  to replace my "boom" box I bought in Ahsland, Oregon in September of 1992.  Back when I would have said, "MP3 what?"  Wow, back when there was no Web.  Anyhoo.  If for some strange reason you feel like  urlLink donating  to the cause of iPod...

      Brief explanation.  I have (possibly) overused the "Patent pending. Patent pending. Patent pending," gag in recent posts.    This line actually comes from Simpsons epsiode  urlLink CABF05  in which Homer "invents" the Spine-O-Cylinder.  (Homer: "Not trash can, son -- Dr. Homer's Miracle Spine-O-Cylinder!  [protectively] Patent pending.")  I have no idea how to navigate the elliptical process of trademarking, registering, patenting, or otherwise stating the right for use of something I create, let alone the energy to do it.  So, simply put:  Patent pending.  I guess it is copyrighted here, but that's about as good as mailing yourself something so you can prove it existed on a certain date.  Which is actually a pretty cheap way to copyright something.  Don't know if it would really "stand up in court," but it could be used as evidence that you are too lazy and poor to afford a lawyer in the first place.  Yup.  It's Friday, and a nice day out, and I am at work.  Really must finish designing the search results screens.

      Mmmm...  Great tag line for a business:  "We're not focused on making money, we're focused on making customers."  Thankyouthankyou.  A focus on customers is a good thing from a customer point-of-view, and the tag line is just vague enough to sound good without really saying anything.  That said, I wish more companies would adopt this tag line and be focused on customers.  Focusing on money won't build a business.  Focusing on customers (who then willingly bring money) allows a business to really grow.  Now, I just need to trademark that phrase...  (Patent pending. Patent pending. Patent pending. ;)

      Egads!  I did a search on  urlLink All the Web  for "fajalar."  Most of the hits are on  urlLink SvN , but a couple of blasts-from-the-past came up.  The log of the High Reaches Weyr  urlLink hatching  that took place on March 23, 1994.  This was back when I was completely addicted to MUSHing, which I started on  urlLink PernMUSH .  What a crazy thing that was.    Real-time, collaborative blogging of sorts.

      This may have been said before, but I have been thinking that usability needs a tag line (like Usability II:  This time it's personal).  I have been toying with clever ways to say something about usability or UCD.  But it finally hit me today.  "It's not about us-ability, it's about you-sability."  Clever!  Consice!  And it becomes trite the more you say it!  Perfect!  So when I finally create Designers Without Borders, and initiate the full power of my dot-org status, I will denounce the current tag line of "Usability does work.  Probably."  It's not about us-ability, it's about you-sability.  (Patent pending.  Patent pending.  Patent pending.)

      Here's one for ya.  Do you sell on ebay?  Do you browse the Web using  urlLink Safari ?  When using Safari, do you set it to block pop up windows?  Me too.  (Yes, I know very few people actually use Safari.)    So I was trying to list my Mariners ticket on ebay and I was using Safari.  I made it all the way through to the 3rd step (pictures and details) when I tell ebay to go ahead an upload my image.    And then I am navigated to the ebay homepage.  Huh?  I tried again.  Same problem.  And again.  And again.  And, yes, again.  Then I opened IE and did it all again.  What fun!  When I told ebay to upload my image, I realized the problem.  Ebay uses a pop up window to give you feedback that the image is uploading (though I have user expectation issues with the text on that page as well).  So when ebay tried to pop it up, Safari said, no.  An ebay couldn't figure out what to do so it took me to it's homepage.  Not being the average user, I should have realized what was happening.  However, I shouldn't have to realize what was happening.  The feedback from ebay should be in the primary page.  If there is a problem, tell me and return me to the Pictures and Details page.  The end result of a successful upload is that I am navigated to step four anyway.  But even worse when I am sent packing to the homepage with no reason why.    More browsers will come with blocking pop up windows built in.  Software is already out that does this.  Ebay, please make this change.   urlLink Questions ?

      Here's an  urlLink article  on the Common Industry Format (CIF) for usability reporting.  (via  urlLink webword.com )  I posted the following as a comment on the webword post:   I think there is actually a lot of commonality in the usability industry as far as  methodology  goes.  Practitioners agree (granted at a high level) on exploratory, assessment, comparative, and validation testing.  They agree on many of the inspection methods used, such as heuristic evaluations and cognitive walkthroughs.  What no one seems to be able to agree on is: what is a usability issue?  What is an error?    They way to go about finding usability issues seems to be settling down, but still up in the air is how we define what we observe during testing or inspection.  The CIF is a good start.  At least some commonality in what is reported might help smooth out some of the differences in reports on the same system by different usability groups.  Many of the groups (some IIRC in the Molich research) still do not define well enough (if at all) measurable, and relevant usability objectives.

      Tony Knowles (aka The Tone) begins ( urlLink most likely ) the arduous process of becoming a US Senator.  This is a very good thing.  But, as the article states, and as we all know, he is going to need a lot of help from Outside.  Alaska is a very conservative state.  But Knowles was mayor of the largest city in the state, and a two-term governor.  He is well known in both urban and (importantly) rural Alaska.  It will be a tough battle for the seat, but with a lot of help in money and time he can win it.   urlLink S. Murkowski  is a talking head of sorts.  She's never held a statewide office, and  urlLink G. Murkowski  (her father) gave her the job.  She's already got a lot of money for Alaska industries, but most of it has been with the hand-holding of "Senator-for-life"  urlLink Ted Stevens .  And Stevens and  urlLink Don Young  are rather powerful.  They may be able to get S. Murkowski to hold the seat.  But she won't be able to do it without them.  So, Tony, get your Web site going.  Get your  urlLink Meetup  on.  Here is some  urlLink info  on The Tone, via issues2000.org.  The info is slightly outdated, but I  assume  most of it is still valid.  Also, here's a brief  urlLink bio .

      I tired to go to carnegiemellon.com today.  I wanted to get to their  urlLink HCII  site to see what research was currently happening.  I didn't know the URL for the HCII site at first so I typed carnegiemellon.com in the address field.  But what I got was this:     Domain Not Supported   We're sorry, this web server no longer supports the carnegiemellon.edu domain. We ask you to please use the preferred domain name, www.cmu.edu, instead.  We invite you to send any questions or concerns to  urlLink webmaster@andrew.cmu.edu .     Notice the Web Master's email addy is a link, but the "new and supported" URL for Carnegie-Mellon is not.  I just love it when a site adopts a new Domain Name and doesn't support the old one.

      The fine line between and excuse and an explanation.  I was in a meeting this morning to start planning for a project.  One of the people there said to the planner, "I would have brought my list of typical tasks to give you, but my printer went all funky right before the meeting.  I'll send them to you via email."  Okay, not a direct quote, but close.  As he finished speaking I thought, "Who cares?"  So he didn't bring it, so what.  It sounded like an excuse, but to him it was probably just an explanation as to why he didn't have it.  Does it depend on if you were  supposed  to do something?  I didn't get the impression that anyone was counting on him to get this done.  It was just a nice to have for the first meeting.  I see people at work all the time riding that line between excuse and explanation.  As with all verbal communication, it takes one to speak and one to listen.  So it is both the intent and the interpretation that get applied to the words used.  But I tells ya, there sure are a lot of people of whom I interpret making excuses.    I didn't get that deliverable done on time because Tim was out of the office last week.  We don't have time to do that because you keep changing requirements.  I'm sorry I set you on fire, but the lighter was just sitting there.   Excuses or explanations?  How about getting your work done when you say it will be done, or making sure people know you are going to be late and when you expect to be done.

      Trying out the  urlLink SparkPod  blogging software.  Tres exciting.  My  urlLink sparkpod .  Although I find it ironic that I am posting here about my posting at another blog.  I just wanted to try it out because it was  urlLink developed  with a Mac.  I am still interested in seeing what  urlLink BloggerPro  has to offer (if it comes back online), and  urlLink TypePad  (whenever it becomes available).  I know  urlLink Phark  is using Typepad.

      Okay.  Time to be a little sensational.  And no I am not being sensational for the sake of limelight, lemonlight, or any other flavoured light.  The tag line of this blog has been "Usability does work.  Probably."  And I still believe it.  Well, the "does work" part is what I believe.  What I am trying to understand is, does usability even matter?  I speak here within the realm of Web design.  Although I think my comments can cross domains, my world of late has been Web apps.  In my guest posting duties on  urlLink SVN , I've tried to focus solely on topics that relate to design and usability.  But I get very little feedback in the comments section.  Wondering why, has led me down the path of, do what I do really matter?  I don't mean in the self-indulging way of, "If no one notices me, I'll just die!" :)  I mean, why can't it be enough to just be a good designer?  I vaguely remember a study on the usability of products that were produced by a designer without usability and one with usability and there wasn't much better about the one that went through usability.  I need to find that study.  Do try to understand for whom you are designing.  Do adhere to the general design rules that have been distilled in other, related fields.  But the just drawn the damn pictures, build it and put it out there.  I am feeling that all usability does is make the designer feel good about his (since I am a "he") choices.  No one really knows how usable the product is until people actually use it.  Many people I have talked with over the years have said similar things.  "You never really know how well it's going to perform until it's out there."  So what's up with these incredibly long product development life cycles?  I think the way I work is backwards.  By the time the product is being piloted (which I think is a good thing), I am long gone from the project.  I think I need to stick around.  But then we don't function on a "product" development structure, but a "project" one.  The distinction is this:  Full product focus vs. feature focus.  This has good points and bad points.  But this usability thing during design just seems to be getting in the way.  I am thinking about full-on lab tests.  I don't see a problem with showing initial design ideas to some people to get some general feedback.  That's quick, and you get to see the large, glaring problems (probably).    Bleh.   urlLink Does usability matter?

      I admit to being a little surprised by the lack of interest in my first topic on  urlLink SVN .  My ideas as to why, so far, are:  1) The people who read the topics and respond on SVN work primarily on small Web sites (information-based, not so much on the Application side of things). 2) They work for small companies, and therefore they have a more flexible working environment. 3) They are primarily contract workers and the companies with which they work do not require any documentation other than (perhaps) UI Specs. 4) My company is just so damn huge that the level of documentation and all the review processes are necessary.  All, some, or parts of the above may be true.  It just seems strange to me that a couple of people said, "huh," to the idea of Future Task Analysis.  Here it is a given that it will be done on a project.  Well, a project that is introducing enough new functionality to warrant it.    Does it only take a good understanding of user and business requirements, coupled with a decent designer who has a good, working understanding of usability?    When people from my company go to conferences, it seems so clear that we are about 5 years ahead of the curve with the way we work.  Most companies struggle to get UCD as part of the project/product methodology.  From my experience, even Microsoft and IBM have difficulty with this.  But, perhaps we have made the process too complex.  Where does that line get drawn?  Build the right product the first time, and add functionality as you go, or build a good enough product at first, then fix it and add functionality as you go.  I was talking with someone who works at Intuit as few weeks ago.  She said that the company brought someone in (I forget who, but he is at the C x O level) whose first statement to the company was, "We will ship products with zero defects."  My first thought was that they will never ship anything, or at least their product life cycle will elongate.  But would it really be that bad to ship without defects?  I guess I need to think more about this issue.  Where does the line get drawn?

      I forwarded Tog's article to the people at work (who care about such things) and got this response back from someone:    [J]ust to be sure... before TOG starts laying claim to "Interaction Architect" as part of the NN/g sales pitch.   Domain Owners:  InteractionArchitect.com - a small consulting group in Belgium by the same name InteractionArchitect.org - digitalmoron Interactionarchitect.net - digitalmoron    In the day-and-age of "better have a Web site, too"-ness (okay I made that up), you'd think that would be one of the things you'd check before saying, "let's be this!"

      Via  urlLink WebWord .   urlLink Girlwonder  also responds to the article.  And now  urlLink Lyle , too.  Tog (Bruce Tognazzini, principal of NN/g) steps up to bat with his  urlLink article  this month.  The only problem is that no one's pitching.  As I first voiced in my comment on WebWord, what gives?  How many times must we have a call to arms in order to be taken more seriously?  Yes, I do prefer "interaction" to "interface," but I don't get bent out of shape over it.  And guess what... neither do my customers.  (The term client is dead, btw, please stop using it and use "customer" instead.)  I just spoke with the guy who sits next to me about starting movements for the sake of starting movements.  Unfortunately, I cannot think of any at the moment.  Let  urlLink me  know if you can think of any.  I blame it on Monday and lack of coffee, but don't misconstrue that as an excuse (see post below).    What I found funny about my conversation with the guy next to me (besides his initial question, "What's a Tog?") was that he thinks of architects as those who design things.  Wonderful things.  But then they take that design to an engineer, and get told why it won't work.  As an (insert "I" word here) designer, I work with many levels of customer.  In no particular order: Project manager, end user, developer (engineer), tester (not usability), other projects, my boss...  All are important, and all must have an understanding of what I do and how to work with me.  A title give the introduction, but it is working successfully with designers that makes people understand when and how to use them.  And if it is successful they are happy to do it.  Titles are only good for business cards, resumes, and placeholders on Gantt charts.  It's the people who do the work, and educate the customer along the way, that continue to make designers and usability professionals successful and sought after.  Bitching about how no one takes us seriously means (to me) that no one takes  you  seriously.  Boo hoo.  And do we really need one more "society" which produces material, and conferences that few can afford to attend?  Don't get me wrong, I love going to CHI and UPA conferences.  I love  urlLink User Experience Magazine .  I actually think that the real problem is that we are too splintered.  Tog's idea runs on the premise that information architects, interaction and interface designers, usability professionals, tech writers, blahblahblahs, seem to think that they are different.  We have the same purpose:  make "it" easy, efficient and satisfactory to all levels of customer.  Tog's idea would do well to focus on more  interaction  between the societies, and less on the rank-and-file.  We know what we do.  We communicate that.  Get the societies together, and then there is power to educate within and without.  With society-level interaction we can be better at communicating to the level of customer that many of us never interact with:  C x O.  That's where many of us probably need the most help.  How does a CIO know it's important to have an information architect on board and not just some developers (no offense devs, I love you!)?  I want to start a movement too.  Well, other than my Designers Without Borders idea.  I am still working on that.  No, the movement aujourd'hui is simple:  Don't listen to Tog.    DLT.  It's just that simple.

      As of tomorrow I get charged (the month of August was a free trial) for my  urlLink TypePad version of usabilityworks.org .    So, I will be moving there permanently (until the next big thing comes along:).  The URL usabilityworks.org is pointing there already.  I'll leave these up for archival purposes.  Hopefully you will join me there!

       urlLink      I am the middle one.  I wish I were there right now.  If I had a "I'd rather be kayaking" bumper-sticker, I'd wear it on my forehead.  That's all.

      I shut down this version of usabilityworks last summer when I made the move to  urlLink Typepad .  I made that move because I wanted to open comments, and Blogger didn't have it at the time.  Yes, I could have moved to BloggerPro, but at the time I felt like opening comments BloggerPro wasn't available.  Then the Google purchase of Pyra happened.  Now we are here.  In part to play around with the new interface, I decided to open this blog back up, but I am repurposing the site.  If you want to discuss usability, design, and business from a practitioner's point-of-view, I will still be publishing at  urlLink usabilityworks.org . I made a conscious decision when I moved to Typepad to only write about usability, et al., and have stuck to that for the most part.  I will use this site to publish about all the things that interest me   not   related to usability, design, and business from a practitioners point-of-view.  I'll get an easier to type domain name in the next couple of days.  On the chosen design:  I chose one of the templates that Zeldman designed because I like the typography and the contrast, as well as the use of white space.  I shied away from the other designs because of contrast issues (readability) and much of the white space was disturbed by using dashed lines and odd background colors.  Some of them are still cool, but that whole usability thing still creeps into every decision I make.  I am a usability geek.  So, without further ado, adieu for now.  Minor update: I did change Zeldman's template in one part; I upped the contrast of the links for the default and visited classes. The color of the original just didn't stand out enough in the sea of plain text.  Apologies to Zeldman, just a preference thing for me.  Like everytime I visit  urlLink zeldman.com  I make my first stop the "contrast-o-meter" so I can read the damnable site.
