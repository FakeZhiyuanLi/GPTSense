      Today  officially  marks my last true day in Tucson.  The past few days have included my show closing, disorganized cleaning/packing, and spending time with some very good friends.  The later of which I will miss very much.  "It's a new beginning full of possibilities and only good things can be in store for you because you deserve it more than anyone."           -- Jose  They are the most humble, generous, accepting, amazing, ambitious, classy people I have ever met.  They make me feel special.  What more can I say?  Thank you all.  I love you.  I  WILL  see you very soon.  Love, hugs, and kisses, B

      I just got back from a short trip to Phoenix with Erik.  We saw the preview of the show he was lighting and we went out afterwards.  I had a nice time and I think he was glad I came up to visit.  Tonight I start the last weekend of my show and then I am off to Colorado.  I am really behind on everything I need to do up there.  I supposed I should be working instead of blogging.  There is a lot of pressure on me to accomplish this and do it well!  I am a little nervous...  The thought of moving to NY is really getting me excited now.  I found a 2 bedroom/2 bath apartment with a den in Manhattan for $1400/month!  It looked really nice in the pictures.  I hope that Trisha and I will be able to find something like that in 3 months or so.

      StageType will serve as my personal account of my trek to fame following the recent completion of my degree in Musical Theatre.  As an actor I can be considered a "stage type" and the blog will be the "stage" for my "type."  StageType will also be my pseudo name for this author.  Look for posts about all things entertainment like movies, theatre, television (and TiVo), music, and amusement parks, as well as my move and experiences in New York City which will be happening very soon.  Till then...Be good!  ST

      I wish I was more adept at blogging.  I just can't seem to find interesting things to discuss.  I am a very opinionated person!  Why can't I express myself in words.  I noticed that today...  I was training our new employee today.  I put in a looooooong 13 hour day to put her into the show before tomorrow!  She was so exhausted, poor girl.  Anyway, I found my self speaking nonsense language to her.  Me:  Blah blah blah, rumble, mmmnuba. Her: Okay. Me:  Then he goes here and then bling blah boom rumble. Her: How big do you want the 'bling'?  LOL!  She was amazing and knew exactly what I was saying, but still, I have a problem expressing myself in words.  :: Here is where I reread my post and began censoring what I originally wrote. ::  In my limited experience, I have found I can be very expressive in a non-verbal way.  When I am affectionate, I can say so much without saying a word.  Now I just need someone to read my non-verbal blog.  I am lonely...where are you?

      The stress is getting to me a little bit.  But we fired the source of a lot of our problems, hopefully in the next week or so I will have more time for myself.  I am also thrown the new curve of getting a roommate.  Not that it's is a bad thing, but I was really enjoying being able to run around naked as I please.  Oh well, I suppose I can survive.  I'm surviving dial-up internet.  LOL.  Oh well,  Six Feet Under  is calling my name.

      Well, it's been awhile since I have had a chance to post.  The show is finally open, but things are still stressful and will be for awhile.  Sonn though, I will be able to take some time off and relax!  I've discovered a lot about myself in the process...especially about my leadership skills and my strength and weaknesses in those areas.  I am so tired right now.  I think the pillows are calling.  More soon...  Be good.

      I am actually reading a book!&nbsp; Yes, that's right folks!&nbsp; I actually plan to read a book for FUN!&nbsp; I haven't read for fun since middle school!&nbsp; I used to read all the time, but I guess I just read too much when I was younger and got bored with reading.&nbsp; Then when it came time to read for school, I just wasn't motivated.&nbsp; I honestly, don't think I read an entire book in my entire college carreer!&nbsp; Funny, I have a 3.5 grade point average.  I'm tired.&nbsp; I am tired of being in limbo.&nbsp; Maybe that's why I am seeking to escape into a book!&nbsp; I am stuck between Tucson and New York City.&nbsp; I just feel trapped in the middle.&nbsp; Lonely, bored, stressed, tired.  Things will get better soon!&nbsp; I am sure of it.&nbsp; Till then, I will be reading...

       urlLink Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera   The trailer for the Christmas 2004 release of the musical Phantom of the Opera was released today.  I find the trailer to be very choppy and not a great piece of advertising.  The choppy editing in the trailer could mean a bad movie musical - which by is unacceptable.  The editing is perhaps the more important in a movie musical than in any other type of film.  Here's why:  In the MTV age where music videos are edited with abrupt jumps and cuts, this is a noticeably common problem in the recent outcrops of new movie musicals.  Filmmakers feel audiences are kept on their toes when watching such editing.  But musicals tell much more of a story through the music and dance than a pop video.  The STORY must come first, cuts and edits should be made at shifts in emotion, thought, verse, sequence, NOT "as fast and as often as possible."  Choreographer and Hollywood director,  urlLink Busby Berkley , was one of the first that pioneered cinematic techniques that highlighted choreography.  Rob Marshall was HIGHLY successful with  urlLink  Chicago  , utilizing cinematic editing to effectively tell the story.  Unfortunately, the awful made-for-television tragedy (as a result of poor editing),  urlLink Meridith Wilson's The Music Man  will be airing this Sunday, July 4th.  Let's keep our fingers crossed for the Cole Porter biopic  urlLink  De-Lovely  , which opens this weekend, and the movie version of the popular stage musical  urlLink  The Producers  , in theaters Christmas 2005.  However, the latter will feature Will Ferrel as Franz Liebkind, which is bound to ruin that...

      Last Sunday, I attended a show at a dinner theatre outside of Denver. An actress I had worked with before was playing a small role in the show so I was looking forward to seeing it.  Well, apparently she had talked about me with her producer because after the show concluded, I found myself in a whirlwind of attention.   "Would you mind singing for us?" "Well...I...don't have my music with me?" "Just sing a little something for us."  Next thing I know I was belting out my best 16 bars and I thought they were going to tackle me.  All of a sudden out of the blue comes a choreographer with his silver tap shoes - all mid-life crisis choreographers have silver tap shoes - and he was pounding out a combination.   "I didn't bring my tap shoes...I didn't know I was going to be auditioning." "That's alright just do it in your tennies."  I was wearing my  urlLink Converse All-Stars .  Mind you, I am currently contracted and plan to move to NYC in about a month, so I really wasn't looking for a job.  So after about 20 minutes of tapping, I found myself explaining to the producer that I was unable to accept a contract because of my current obligation.  He understood and offer me a position with the company at another time, should I want it.  Wow!  ***  Trish and I booked our flight to NYC. We will be leaving one-way to the Big Apple on September 21st. I am so excited! I can't wait!  ***  Trish and I went out for a nice dinner the other night at  urlLink Outback Steakhouse . Throughout the whole dinner the waitstaff kept staring at me. Finally, our waitress brings the check and tells me that all the waiters and waitresses agree that I look like  urlLink Jude Law . I thought it was a very nice compliment. What do you think?  StageType  urlLink    Jude Law  urlLink
