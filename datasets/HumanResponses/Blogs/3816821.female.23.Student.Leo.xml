      Today as I was walking around the town centre I noticed a traffic warden trying to calmly explain to a rather irate &nbsp;gentleman that he would have to move his car as where he was parked was a no waiting area. The situation made me think, especially as recently there has been talk of having to pay to park on the Wellingborough Rd. I signed the petition against the measure, and only hope that the council listens to the businesses that are along the Wellingborough Rd so that they don't lose custom. But I digress, the main reason for this post was that I wanted to rant about parking and traffic wardens. Maybe my rant will be somewhat different to other peoples opinions though... I'll admit that there seems to be mant traffic wardens about now, and that it is an easy way to increase revenue by ticketing people's cars, but I admire their bravery in some situations where people can get extremely hostile, and I certainly wouldn't want to do their job. I can understand people getting annoyed when they receive a ticket, especially if the area is not clearly marked out, but most places in Northampton are sign posted as pay and display. Can we really complain if we just sneak off in the hope that a traffic warden won't catch us? I worked as a van driver for a while, and one of my biggest annoyances out on the road was (other than people who drive at 45-50mph on a 60 limit) finding a car parked in a loading bay. I really wish that people would have more consideration when it comes to parking in a loading bay. A loading bayis designed to make delivering easier for drivers, who will probably still have to carry or cart parcels up to a block away. The worst time I remeber was a delivery and collection in Ely, requiring myself and a friend to move approximately 40 parcels 200 yards up the road ( and then up and down stairs in the shop!! ). The car that was parked in the loading bay in question moved not long after we finished, and was promptly replaced by another person who thought it was ok just to stop there for a moment. And I see the same thing occur in Northampton every day. Have some courtesy for drivers trying to do a job, and leave loading bays clear for them. If you don't and you then receive a ticket - please don't try and complain. The same situation as above follows for disabled parking bays. How many times do you see someone just pull in for a minute? Disabled spaces are limited, and are designed to make it easier for disabled to use the facilities in Northampton as easily as the rest of us. So let's try to leave disabled spaces for the truely disabled!! There are probably some of you saying to yourselves that you have never done either of those two things. But I bet you've gone over your time limit on your parking. It happens all the time... you look at your watch and realise that your time is nearly up, you rush back and reach your car 5 minutes late, but fortunately no one has ticketed it yet. If they had, many people would immediately be complaining, moaning at the traffic warden in question that they were only 5 minutes late. You were late though - you knew how long you had and you over ran. You had two options, which were to make sure that you payed for enough time before you left your car ( I always pay for more time than I need ), or return in time. If you don't return in time, don't complain. How many minutes and hours over parking limits do we go as a town every week. All that extra time adds up to is .... yes you've got it .... more cars that could have parked there in the same amount of time. So, basically the gist of my rant is, if we all act decently and treat the parking laws with respect, then far more cars would be able to park in town making it easier and fairer for everyone. Including the traffic wardens who wouldn't be needed if people didn't break the rules. Think about it.

      As a student at UCN I feel that it is important to cover stories that involve the future of education within Northampton. It would be a huge boost to the town if UCN did get full University status, and would certainly attract even more students to study in Northampton. In my experience, University College Northampton is an outstanding institution. I have studied at two universities ( I left in my first year of study previously ), and in my opinion of UCN,&nbsp;the teaching standards are excellent, and the atmosphere and support given to students is superb. The only thing that UCN lacks is the ability to award research degrees. This is currently being addressed, and it has been an important aspect during this year. The student reps and many tutors have been involved in the application process&nbsp;for University status. Hopefully, if all goes well, then UCN should be awarded its University status by the end of this year. There is also talk of backdating some awards so that degrees will state University of Northampton. There was news announced this week that the guidelines for becoming a university will change, and therefore if UCN did not achieve university status this year then it would reapply under the new rules. Unfortunately although the new rules would mean that UCN would become a university, they would be unable to award research degrees, and the general concensus is that the ability to award research degrees is vital. A university in name alone would not be enough for many tutors and students.  So, for the mean time, we wait for the decision to see whether we become a university or not.  I'd love to hear from current students, ex students, tutors and ex tutors as well as anyone else who has an opinion on the issue. &nbsp;

      The schools in Northamptonshire are almost all closed for summer now, and some of them are now closed for good. Northampton is moving from a three tier education system ( lower, middle and upper schools )&nbsp; to a two tier system ( primary and secondary ).  I left school about 5 years ago now - I stayed on at my upper school for my A-Levels. But even though it has been&nbsp;quite a&nbsp;while, I still feel a bit sad to hear of the closing of many of the local schools. My old upper school - Thomas Becket - is now to become a secondary, and therefore is taking on approximately 400 extra pupils. My old middle school - St Mary's - is closing for good, and there will be development on the site to turn it into a primary school. I can't say I am confident that this change will do any good for the standard of education within Northampton. I remember teachers already stretched to their limits, and doing their best with the few resources that were made available to them. I cannot see how crowding hundreds more pupils in to a school will improve their education.  I hope that this change will work out for the best, but I really don't see how forcing teachers to try to teach both fairly young children - 11/12 year olds&nbsp;at the start of secondary school -&nbsp;all the way to young adults taking A-Levels, will improve teaching standards. At least before these changes&nbsp;teachers were focused on a particular age group, and therefore able to prepare those pupils better for exams and such like, and teach them in a consistantly good manner. I might not have shown it at the time but I did appreciate my education and all the teachers ever did for me. It was a great atmosphere between pupils and teachers, many of the teachers still have a fond place in many of our hearts. I hope that by adding 400 plus pupils to the school does not remove this aspect of Thomas Becket for future generations. It&nbsp;seems clear to me that this is just a way for Northampton Council to save money on the costs of schools, whilst not really bothering about what the children will learn, how they will be affected, or how the teachers within the schools will take the changes either. Even so, I wonder how much money that could be better spent on improving facilities will be instead used to rapidly upgrade the capacity of the schools. It feels like a waste to me. Maybe I'm just going to miss the fact that I won't be able to drive past St Mary's Middle and think back to all the good times there ( or the bad times ). I think I'm just getting sentimental that things are changing.  So, I will finish this post by saying goodbye to St Mary's Middle School, and good luck to Thomas Becket in it's new role as a secondary. If anyone else has any opinions on this, or stories to share, then please feel free. I'd love to hear what current teachers and pupils think of all the changes. Just add a comment and let me know.

      It seems as if the future of the old Express Lifts' Tower is beginning to look a little more safe. Recent development on the site surrounding the lift tower, and reports that houses may be built close to the base of the tower itself, seem to show that the tower may be safe from demolition. The lift tower has a grade II listed status, due to the fact that there are no other buildings like it in the UK. It closed in 1997, and has stood unused ever since. In 2001 began a fight for survival, when the owners at the time applied to demolish the tower. It has also been reported that the tower suffers from "concrete cancer" and requires extensive repairs to stop it from eventually collapsing.    There are conflicting opinions about the tower. Many local people see it as a symbol of Northampton. I know that when I've been away, I know I'm home when the lift tower appears over the horizon! It is certainly a recognisable aspect of Northampton, and a longstnding part of the skyline. Unfortunately, the tower is disused, and does not really have any other viable business uses. Surely Northampton has more to offer than a derelict lift tower?!! My own opinion is that something needs to be done, either to incorporate it in someway with the current developments around the site, or otherwise we need to pull it down. Otherwise it will loom over us as a sign of the end of an era of British manufacturing. It will become an eyesore if something is not done soon. I'd like to know what other people think, so please feel free to post your comments. What do you think should be done? Can you think of any viable uses for the tower? Also please take the time to vote on the issue!! Thank you

      Well, this is my first post for you all. I'll give anyone who comes along some time to settle in first, before getting down to business. Welcome everyone. I'm Marianna Worthy, a 22 year old student at University College Northampton. I'm studying BA Electronic Business, and I must admit that I hadn't really heard of "Blogs" until my course introduced me to them.  I have lived in Northampton for nearly all my life (ok, so I lived in Birmingham for a bit...) and now that I'm staying here for the next few years, until I finish my course at UCN, I thought I'd try to get some discussion about the town. There are always issues in the news that affect Northmapton, and this will give me the chance to ramble on about them, maybe even offer up solutions to some of the problems. I also look forward to the insight offered by other residents of Northampton, and also from people from all over the world. Maybe someone else knows the solution to Northampton's problems!!? I also look forward to adding photographs to this Blog, of Northampton as I see it today. Maybe other people will be inspired to take photographs and submit them to me for addition to the Blog. The point is that I want this Blog to represent all the issues that Northampton has, all the good and all the bad points about Northampton, all the successes and all the failures. I want the best for Northampton while I'm living here, and I hope others do too.

      So the football season has kicked off again, and without doing anything the Cobblers are already in League 2 - How often do we have to rename our football leagues??!!!! Anyway, things have been looking good for the Cobblers. A strong finish to last season, coupled with some good purchases over the summer look set to lead us to a top three finish, and most bookies are tipping us for the top spot. Having followed Northampton Town FC for a good few years, it has sometimes been difficult to keep the faith. It looked good when we moved up to Division Two ( League One!!) but the success was short lived. Now we need to get promotion and stay up!! The good news is we started the season in the way we needed to. An away fixture to Swansea was never going to be the easiest of games, but we came out 2-0 winners. Lets keep it up for the rest of the season!!!!
