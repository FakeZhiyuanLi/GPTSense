      (I wrote this on June 27 and just not got it on here....sry for someone who has no life I sure am behind...)  well today was so boring...Yea great way to start off the first entry but who's reading anyways! Well my 3 best friends ever( Alana, Kindall, and Sarah) went camping Thursday night and I was suppose to go BUT of course I had to work..I called in Friday told a tinny tiny lie and got at the camp ground around noon....it was great..they had met these 2 guys One was all shaggy hair skater, the other was like im black( he was so white). Anyways they were really awesome.   Well it couldnt stay great too long. My Aunt(Alanas mom...shes my cousin...really). Came to get her around 5 that afternoon...They were going on a "family vacation" for one day...yeah its gay i know believe me. My aunt didnt even plan it till after we planned the camping trip.   That night(without Alana) we went snipe huntin'. If ya dont know what that is you need to get out more. Its great. We took Kindall's little brother and his friend. They had no idea what it was...so it was Me, Kindall, Sarah, Travis, Josh(2 guys we met) , Paul, and A.J.(bro and friend) in the woods pitch black with 2 small flashlights and 2 plactic bags. Well Kindall, Josh, and Sarah left me and Travis with the new guys. They were gonna meet us at our special place while we waited for Paul and A.J. to find us. Travis and I explained to them what they were suppose to do and they were so excited...i told them i needed the flashlights so they wouldnt scare off the snipes and of course they were like oh you're right here ya go Al...im just like this is too easy. Well they started "huntin the snipes" and I grabbed Travis and started running and aparently he wasnt paying attention and just stood there. I forgot to take my flip-flops off so i could barely fun. it was horrible. There I was running in the woods, pitch black, with flip-flops on, and there was a lake around where i was running and i had to make sure i didnt trip and call off the narrow bridges and fall in.  I got back to the special place and waited and waited and it took forever for the other  guys to get there. They found Travis, A.J. and Paul on their way. They were laughing so hard they could barely stand. When Paul finally realized what was going on he started running after me and fell and scratched his whole stomach and leg up. I felt kinda bad but hes the one who wanted to go. Travis was sore that i supposedly left him but he just stood there so hes his fault he was left in the dark. After we all recovered from snipe huntin' we walked around forawhile to get the bags Paul and A.J. left of the trees. Then we went back to the camper and listened to music. The Travis and Josh left and we talked forever and finally went to sleep.  Then i had to get up at 8 the next morning which was today and drive all the way home and be at work at 12. IT SUCKED MAJOR BUTT!!!  I was having the most awesome dream about Brandon Boyd(lead singer of incubus). We were at my house about to go swimming. Then off of a sudden I hear Kindall and Sarah screaming AL GET UP!! AL AL AL AL AL ITS TIME TO GET UP!! I am definitely not a morning person. When i finally decided to get up it was okay because Melinda(Kindalls mom has breakfast cooked....it was good!  Then i went home....went to work from 12-7 and did nothing....practically stood around all day...and ya think well thats a pretty good job...getting paid $7 an hr for nothing. but it sucks. I'd rather be working non-stop then just stand around for  hrs. then i came home and went to sleep till like 9 or 10. and played my awesome guitar who i missed so much while i was gone. His name is Kurt Don Armstrong for my 3 favorite guitar players. and now its almost 2 in the morning and im so tired i cant sleep. just sittin here listening to Chris Carrabba sing his heart out while i rant on and on about the life i dont have..lol. how awesome am i...well if you read all this im sorry you have no like. but thanks.lol later
