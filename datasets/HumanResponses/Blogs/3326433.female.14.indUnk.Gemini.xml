      So after the Niagara started, and the actual intakes of air, it just wouldn't stop. And the tears kept pilin' too! So glad I had an awesome night of dancing before that...(Girls Just Wanna Have Fun! That was aweeeesome :D)  And now, the second part, which comes second  (  Shreeky, aka Infringed Papaya, is moving. To Guelph's suburbs. That's not all...Guelph IS a suburb. So it's pretty much a waste of farmland/dump. And not to be racist, even though I am, it's all white (or so she says). No fobs. Wahh. I know. This is my reply to her email:   Howdy there, cowgirl! How's y'all been?  Yes. I am the south. I know how to talk. I know how it goes. And we actually never say "Howdy"...it's always "Hey girrrl" and "Hey BHOI!". Not exactly normal language. Black ppl langauge, always. Wait..hmm...maybe its cuz everyone there was black. Which means ur language will be "Oh, like, hey!" *ditzy hair twirl*  Becuz that is the white.  Anyway. I was pretty much laffin instead of crying, but oh, the tears'll come. I actually knew be4 u told me cuz my dad said that your dad had gotten a job...in guelph, of course. So it wasn't official, I didn't jump to conclusions, but now it appears I don't have to   K. First. WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN!??!!?!? Dear god, it's before school, isn't it? omfg u suck. so bad. Why? Well, obviously its tres tres bad for me, but tres tres worse for you! You had a NAME here. There, you're just...new girl. Your'e freaking NEW GIRL! Omg you're New Girl. Eww...new girl!   Sigh. Sighy sigh sigh. Here's my sis, just about to attempt to fix my bike so she can go bike riding with her friend...and to think we're NEVER GUCKIN (hehe) GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT EVER GUCKIN AGAIN. YOU GUCKING DUCK. omg. Wahhhhhhh.......wahhhh .....wahhhhhhhhh.  Sigh again. Ok. Mus find out details first. When, where, GUCKIN why...all that SHRIT. So save the wailing for later. Freakin try convincing. That won't work. But..but...it's your LIFE!! its...its...RUINED! omg ur life is ruined!!! OK so try the convincing thing, DEFINITEly include some crying (just think of me, the specialness) but this is no easy job, cuz its not convincing ur mum to go outside, or for 5 bucks...its for GUCKIN life. omg. fu..gone forever...omg....WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! u DUCK!  Sigh last time. Wanna see? http://azyne.blogspot.com/ Unfortunately is GUCKIN called Almost Famous, but I guess that's never gonna GUCKIN happen again, thanks to the DUCK. Sigh. Wahh. Ta ta.   Sigh. For the real last time. Sigh. This really, really, really sucks. I mean, DUCKS.

      Two things.  Howdy. Aww...*weep weep* That reminds me of my second thing. But first, the first thing  (  Grad. Oh dear god. Literally danced the night away. *Is Lord(ette) of the dance!!! Whooo!* Twas amazing. And I always figured I would cry a bit, right, but the day before, the day of our play, everyone was bawling and I had no tears. Was very afraid that the robot in me would take over on grad night as well. Which is almost what happened...I didn't feel a sad emotion through my veins all night.   Until the end.  I saw Lizi, who had tears in her eyes, who was hugging AQ or somebody and she just said "Bye Mim, I love you, I'm gonna miss you so much!" And I just freakin lost it. Somehow. The tears came, didn't stop...but oh, it wasn't pretty crying...it most DEFINITELY wasn't pretty crying. Had the whole nostrils-flared, puffy, squinty eyes, tomato face thing going on...am I cool or WHAT?   Ok, wait. To be continued...
