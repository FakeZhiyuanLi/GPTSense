      yesterday i went to this future leaders forum thingy.....and man was it boring and interesting.......... mildly interesting when the theatre arts director dude and the Rhodes scholar dude went up there and talked about themselves, cracked af ew jokes.....managed to make a few laughs..... it was slightly a yawn when you were high on caffeine and couldnt sit still AND couldnt here a word what the lady was talking about.......we then had two lawyers talk......one said.....errrr..the coporate lawyer dude...u're allowed to make mistakes.......he even encouraged making mistakes....and the other.....environmental lawyer...was a female....n i cant remmeber much of what she said........it was interesting but i mustve kept fading in and out.....but shes travelled Australia moved jobs a lot......yea,.............but the most interesting part of the day was the very last 15 minutes of the forum......NOW that was pure entertainment...... they gave us the opportunity to voice what our thgouhts were........n there were a lot of opinion on the 25% raise in the HECS fees.......this debate ended in quite a bit of a lets say controversy.....with a guy replying to another guy with some very very well choiced words which i will not utter here......hehe.....it was quite interesting......cause the guy from trinity went on about how hes been working his arse off since yr 5 on a scholarship..joined the choir to maintain the scholarship......only to find out that he had to work extra hard now to be able to pay the HECs fees......and this guy...can remember who....but he tells him off....by telling him to stop whinging and get off his arse and carry on.....or seomfign like that......it was rather interesting.....but he was kind of a bit offensive.......lol....but yea........quite a way to finish of a mildly inteeresting or boring, which ever you look at it.....forum/conference......

      hahha i was just watching 60 minutes about 2 hrs ago....they had an article about tornados, more like the thrill that people get out of chasing wild thunderstorms in the hope of catching a glimpse of the creation of tornadoes and then fleeeing for their lives when a tornado has formed. Its actually rather funny how someone has actually built up a successful business in tornado thrill seeking! lol that is like so ingenius. That is what a businessman should be about, how to turn his obsession into something that has some cash coming in at the same time.   like any business, tornado seeking has its ups and downs. The downs are being the enormous risks in taking people on tours across the middle of America to find twisters has some risks, like the risk of disappointing clients and of course the risk of lives being lost (which could result in a major Law suite in which Lawyers get a hell of a lot of money!). The ups of course is to see the look of joy and amazement in people's faces and know that their money has been well worth it. And also the thrill of experiencing the same kind of obsession that other people in the tour group has. Anywayz, the question im trying to pose here is,  Should people really set up a tornado touring business? Is it worth it or not?

      you know what is so stupid? People who call you friend but seriously dont care a rats arse about you. I hate people who says they are your 'friend' but their real motive in befriending you is actually to gain something for themselves. Its like when they need you, they'll come to you. Yet when you need them, they're not there. Not only are they not there but they have disappeared off the face of the earth. I really hate that. The world is so superficial nowadays. Its everyone for themselves. grrrrr
