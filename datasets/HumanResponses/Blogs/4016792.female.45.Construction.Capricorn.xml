       My friend Cathie came back from Aruba looking tan and gorgeous. Decided to go to the movies with Gina and Cara to see Fahrenheit 9/11. My second time. Oh, and it was her treat. Sweet.  The thing that blows my mind the most is the information about the Bush and bin Laden families' financial entanglements, culminating with their involvement with the Carlyle Group. I had heard of Carlyle, but knew very little about it. I googled it up when I got home and came up with   urlLink  this video   , originally broadcast on VPRO Netherlands TV. This stuff is enough to keep you up at night.  Anyway we agreed, I think, that you can only use so much money. Why do so many people put so much energy and extraodinary effort into making more than they could ever spend? I cannot imagine becoming so dehumanized that I could feel comfortable with the knowledge that I was exploiting or manipulating anyone, never mind everyone.  Of course, I have my own plans for world domination. The manifesto isn't quite complete, but it has something to do with casting spells with chocolate. I think.  Michael Moore documents the research for his claims   urlLink  here   . He definitely has his point of view, and he's passionate about it, but his research seems impeccable.

        So I just got my car back yesterday, and I'm so happy because I have wheels again, and it's no longer making these indescribable loud noises, and I'm a free woman once again........but now there seems to be a fuel problem of one kind or another, one kind being minor, and the other kind requiring a major overhaul. Either way, it's blowing so much smoke that the people behind me can't see where they're going, and I am doing irreparable harm to the quality of the air.   Should make tomorrow morning's commute excruciatingly embarrassing .

        I spend the afternoon watching the Mets give away the game to Arizona. I love those guys, but they can frustrate the hell out of me. Then Susan and I decide to go to Ralph’s fishing station on the dock and have a beer. Or two.

        Went to the movies with my daughter, Lisa. She’s a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan, so we’ve been looking forward to seeing The Village. Stopped at Starbucks for coffee on this rare Saturday with her at home. She’s working toward her master’s while working 2 full time jobs, so usually she has classes on the weekends. She has a few weeks now between the end of summer session and the beginning of the fall, so we’ve been able to spend some time together.

       This happened a couple of weeks ago.  I go to Burger King for dinner. Hey, I'm not proud of it -- everyone has their dark side. I don't eat red meat, so I order the crappy chicken sandwich. I ask for a tender crisp sandwich with no mayonnaise and a diet coke. The female voice behind the microphone gets this real strange tone as she tells me to drive around to window #1.  I drive around the building toward my food, and I see the girl who took my order hanging out - all the way out - of the window. She's outside from about mid-thigh up. She's waving her arms at me very excitedly- hurry up. hurry up. This particular Burger King has situated this window pretty high up. I guess to accommodate SUVs and trucks. She's hanging out like the munchkin at the gate to the Emerald City.  She waves me over and points at the car in front of me, driven by a blond kid about 20, "see him? see him? he just ordered the tender crisp sandwich with   extra   mayonnaise, then you come along next and order the tender crisp sandwich with   no   mayonnaise." This chick is  astonished  by this nearly  inconceivable  sequence of events.  It seems rude to not to acknowledge the high point of her day. "Well," I say, "that's why we're divorced now." It kills. Where was this woman when I was thinking of doing stand-up? She loses it. She's laughing so hard that she feels compelled to go get everyone else on the shift and bring them in on the joke. Pulls people off the grill. Within a minute, 5 or 6 Indian women are crowding the drive-thru laughing about condiments and broken marraiges. And the poor guy, my ex, in the car ahead has to wait for his food while wondering why he's being pointed at.  Eventually they send me on my way. "No mayonnaise, no mayonnaise," in chorus. I swear.  Never enjoyed one of those lousy sandwiches more in my life.

       Is it possible for a '98 Hyundai to spontaneously heal itself? I'm here to testify, brothers and sisters, that mine has. The check engine light is gone, it has all the power and performance of any 6 year old, 4 cylinder, Korean muscle machine, and I can even use the air conditioning.  Of course, about 2 hours after this divine intervention, I found myself on my knees praying that the goddess of kitchen appliances would raise my dishwasher from the dead. The torment! I'll take the bus, but I won't do dishes. I won't.  I finally found the exact spot to kick (harder to find than the G- spot) to turn the damn thing on, but it wouldn't fill with water.  Despair. Water is the whole point.  So I used my big soup pot to fill the thing, soaking the floor in the process, kicked the D- spot, and ta da! clean dishes.  I don't want to have to do that again any time soon, so I'll just have to stop shopping and cooking, and eat out all the time. Problem solved. Coming soon to a blog near you -  Adventures in Dining Out .

       Drove out to Montauk (risky - since the check engine light is still flashing at me and the inspection is 2 months overdue. I continue to live my life on the edge.) and slept on the beach. Found this really cool little crab shack and had some dinner with jazz in the background.  Now must take the d-o-g for a w-a-l-k. If she even hears me typing it she will go botz. Then I'm thinking bubble bath, red wine and John Coltrane.

       OK, so I should stop playing with the html and actually post something, right? So much self-discipline required, I'm not sure I'm up to whole blog thing. Friday night, thank god. A weekend stretches before me filled with fabulous possibilities....must climb out of the work clothes and go find something fun to do. Scheduled all my days off for the rest of the year. Lots of long weekends and a week in December. A little traumatic for me, and for Chris, who made me promise to available by cell phone, but I feel so freeee now, and can't wait the two weeks until my first couple of days of down time. In the middle of the week!

       Happy anniversary, Kitty and Mike.    urlLink        You are probably finding the baby day counter obnoxious, but eventually you may find it adorable. Or tolerable. Or not. My blog. Get used to it.  Enjoy the sun in Santa Del Whatever. I am planning a few long weekends myself, as difficult as it is for me to take off from work. You never know what might happen in my absence. They may find that they can get along without me. So I have 15 days still to take before the end of the year or I lose them. Haven't taken a day off yet this year. I am either the best employee EVER, or out of my mind. Very certain that both are true. So I am forcing myself to schedule 10 days off during August, September, October, and then the week before Christmas. I heard American Airlines has $199 fares between New York and LA if booked this week. Must look into.  Anyway, I'm thinking a spa day is in order. I desperately need a massage. A loooooong massage. I feel like the stress of the last 45 years is knotted into my neck.  By the way, in case anyone is wondering, Kathleen is the best friend in the world. Talking sense when I needed it. Thanks.  Oh, and I never did find anyone to go to the movies with Sunday night, because (rant) everyone I know is lazy and boring. It's the movies, for chrissakes, not like a huge commitment, you sit in the dark for 2 hours, how can you not "be up" for that??  So I went myself and saw I Robot. Perfectly acceptable sci-fi stuff, but I would have liked to have seen the robot's character more fully developed. I seem to remember more depth in the novel. Must reread. Come with me next time, or miss once again my insightful and witty commentary.

       What a week. Survived the preparation of our new branch location for a visit by the Vice President of North American operations, car trouble part 3, and I don't know what else. Now I have to do my laundry so I can do it all over again starting tomorrow morning, and find someone to go to the movies with because goddammit I am going to have a little fun this weekend. Time is running out.
