      You always told me that I wanted things to be too simple Why does I love you have to be complex to be beautiful   i love you is the most elaborate way to express my emotions in those three little words I reveal that the smooth ease of your smile is enough to shake the very core of the earth that crumbles underneath my barefeet as I walk across our tiny yard to bring you a frosty glass of lemonade on a steamy Juneday U standing there leaning against our rusty old shovel covered in potting soils surrounded by freshly pulled weeds is no greater than i love you.    i love u is enough to declare to you that on the sticky October day when you met me at the El stop with our tattered golf umbrella because the forecaster said that there 70% chance of rain and you didnt want me to get wet, I was soaking in the lovedrops that you had been raining on me for years deep sea diving in the ocean that is our love so large and expansive that I may never ever see all the beautiful creatures that breathe within its still waters i love u says all that and more.   i love u is the only way to tell you that. because you arose at the suns awakening every snow blanketed day of December to clean powder flakes from the windshield of our rusty Jalopy to warm it so that my gloved hands would not be cold resting on the steering wheel  on my daily journey through bitter Windy City traffic jams, Ill never be cold again I could walk barefoot and bare bottomed through the frozen tundra of the arctic and still be heated by warmth of those frigid frostbitten mornings i love u are the only words I have   i love u is the lifeline that breathes for me as I stand in this misty April day while the tears rolling down my cheeks baptize the ground of your freshly dug catacomb here at the final resting place for your body I realize that in i love u there is no final resting place for your soul, your spirit, or our love    In i love u I can still feel the delight of your pretty skin   In i love u there is the sound your gleeful laughter   In i love u I can see the children we intended to have   In i love u I can taste the undeniable tang of strawberries on your tongue   in i love u I can smell your lasting aroma of cocoa butter, baby powder, and mint   in i love u there will always be me   in i love you there will forever be you   in i love you there is everything   in i love you there is Complex Simplicity and Simple Complexity  in i love u there is my i love you  and in my i love u there are no words    Written By: Senam Amegashie @ 11:01pm 10/04/02 @4844

      Eye/Word/Read Finger/ Page/ turn Daddy/ Fist/ ME Reading Raindbows make me forget...   Butterfly in the sky I can go twice  as high Take a look  It's in a book A reading rainbow   I am the colored girl who read rainbow when suicide was not enough Paule marshall built me into a strong brown girl with brown stones of words toni taught me that even the Bluest eye were no better that my beloved browns I read ramona and realized that not every daddy would be like mine and that i should be brave. I spent childhood with eyes wrapped around words words wrapped around soul and soul just barely making it Maya applauded me when mama couldn’t I picked up the color purple cause bruises look purple on brown skin who knew that book would heal The Babysitters lead lives I always wished for. I wished my Mom and dad would divorce so I could Have rich stepdad like Kristy. I wished Everyday after school on my daily trek to the library my home from 3:30 to 9:00 Fed by the librarians Comfortable among the stacks Where my mother and father Zora and Richard Would sing me sweet stories of strength To fortify my soul As I prepared for the battle To make it till the next 3:30   I can go anywhere  Friends to know  And ways to grow A reading Rainbow   Soon I didn’t need to be at the library to Get lost in the word. They started coming to me on my own Writing words filled my head And I swam in them when pain tried to drown my happy words like life preserving rafts came to my rescue I learned to breathe through pens scream on paper and to love in notebooks on days when neighbors used to touch me in dirty places I washed myself clean in those pages My daddy used to take me to bookstores and buy me books Any book I wanted My daddy used to beat me with wooden sticks Any time he wanted My mommy would let me stay up late reading words written by women who were strong enough to leave Cuz she knew she wasn’t And she wanted me to be I Am   I can be anything  Take a look  It's in a book  A Reading Rainbow  A Reading Rainbow    ~ Senam 12:18pm 10.20.2003 (c) senam amegashie 2003 Song lyrics From theme of PBS's Reading Rainbow

           I'm new here And i just haven't had enough time to write on here but tommorrow I will be back to begin my Journeys in Blogville. I'll be back tommorrow. To tell you all about the fabulous day off I spent on the couch beating my boyfriends ass at Super Mario Bros. (the original version). The pure comedy of the whole day was watching him hold the remote. He just can't get his big ole hand around the remote properly. I am going to take a picture of him holding it. Comedy!!     But here is a quick rundown....     I'm not sure but I think I got removed from my new residence. I moved in with my boyfriend last week and was feeling real good about it. I have finally gottten to a good place with our relationship, the ups and downs and all the good and bad that makes me like being his girlfirend. I had figured out where all my stuff was supposed to go, how exactly to display all 22 diferent pairs of black shoes, what do with all 17,000 pieces of clothing, and even figured out where to put all the "fruity shit" he doesn't want in our shared space.      All is well,  right , but then.... his cousin breaks up with his wife and moves all of his shit in. It went like this... we were at the laundry washing all of our clothes. Pablo calls says," hey Mike she's trippin. can i stay with you dog?" Mike says his favorite word,"Cool!" And twenty mintes later we walk into the house and all of Pablo's earthly belongings are in our dining room. I mean everything T.V., Speakers, Furniture, Clothes, everything. And at that moment I felt displaced once again. I guess i'll talk about why later but the big thing is never ever in my life have i ever felt completely comfortable at the place where i lay my head. And I think that first week of living here I felt what home feels like. Noisy, a little messy, a little disorganized, a little bit of him, a little bit of me, a lot of his kids and a lot of laughing. I felt good. I felt peaceful. That's the big word PEACEFUL!!! I don't feel that often. It escapes me to quickly and last night I felt like I lost it once again. Damn! Damn! Damn!

      No, I am not talking about my ex boyfriend. I'm talking about real ones. Why is it that people who own dogs are convinced that you want there mutt to jump all over your ass. I mean aren't there leash laws. I'm on my walk today and I encounter the same leachless woman and dog twice. I am allergic to dogs and really all animals for that matter. I can't have them touching me or anything. If they do all hell will break loose. For me. NOt for you. So don't tell me,"Oh he won't do anything to you" or "he wouldn't hurt a fly." Its not flies I am worried about its me and he will do something to me. Something like give me a asthma attack or a nasty rash or just the aggraviation of having your motherfucking dog jumping on me. SO KEEP HIM OFF ME!!!! She had the audacity to look pissed when I asked her politely to please remove him from the middle of the sidewalk and hold him so I could just walk by. I understand you love your dog. I don't love him and i don't have to but you have to respect the fact that I would like to walk by him without having to wonder which hospital I will have to go to if he makes a lunge for my ass. Ok so thats enough. I feel like i should say something warm and fuzzy like " I like babies" to make myself not sound so grumpy.  I am not grumpy. Just sweaty and covered in dog hair...

      Yesterday I didn't go to work again. They wouldn't put me on the schedule because I wouldn't work the shit shifts they have been trying to give me. I work on straight commission. So I feel that since I'm not making money just to sit around that motherfucker why should I go and sit around there pay for parking and waste my time. I got poems to write. Songs to sing, programs to plan. I am not going to spend 6 hours helping some indecisive ass person find a 500 dollar studio for October only to have them tell me oh well I'm just kind of looking at my options I just want to look around. Well if you want to look around do that. Don't waste my time and gas money for your tour around Chicago. Ok so I've got just a little bit of animosity!! But I am going to pop in there later on today take a sheet and see if I can rent an apartment. I have no time for BS. I like the job when I am there and doing it but getting the gumption to go is a B*tch. Hhhmm that was awfully cranky of me.  I am having trouble forcing myself out the door for my daily walk today. Its only day three for christsake I should be raring to go. What is it though? It takes like 21 days to form a habit. I am trying my damned to make exercise a habit. I declare that as soon as I finish typing this I am walking my ass outside and taking my 20 min walk. A 20 min walk is nothing. I should think of it as twenty minute of peace with Senam. Yesterday I brought my cell phone with me. I can't tell if that is a mistake or a way to keep me going and motivated. I was so busy talking to my friend I barely realized that my twenty minutes was up. But I do enjoy the quiet solitude of just me and city sounds for twenty minutes in the morning. I realize that I need to do this walking everyday for it to stick. That means that this weekend when we go to south haven I must move my ass. I will play baseball and basketball with Tony and Alanis. I will take walks on the beach one for sure two ideally I just don't know if there is enough time. So since I started walking, all I want to do is eat like before I ate like on meal a day and would be fine now I am at three whole meals a day and possibly a snack. Scientifically, I understand that my metabolism is just kicking in but I feel like a pig stuffing myself that much but hey fuck it I gotta eat. What are good breakfast food to munch before my walk???  I am off to take my walk RIGHT NOW!!!

      I went on a walk today. First thing in the morning, I got up put one my little workout outfit and hightailed my little ( I should say my soon to be little) butt around my neighborhood. I felt good. This is the second time this week. And I think the time is just invaluable. First of all I like the feeling of moving my body and being active. Its something that I have always loved anyway big or not. Racing Michael in the park, running bases with Tony chasing, Alanis around the house. I want to do those thing with no effort at all. I don't want to be out of breath walking up and down stairs I don't want to feel all stressed out when any kind of physical exertion comes up. Two weeks ago, I went to the doctor and and when they weighed me, my jaw dropped. I am officially 221 lbs. Get the F*ck out of here. I almost jumped off the scale when I saw it I couldn't believe it. I have never been weight crazy, or a size junkie. I mean it I need a bigger or smaller size who cares I just get it and move along. But 221 lbs is ridiculous. I could tell that thing were getting out of hand with me too. I just haven't felt right. My eating has definitely been out of control and the activity has slowed quite a bit since I'm not a waitress anymore. I don't spend 14 hour days on my feet busting wings all across a huge restaurant. I am the victim of the hated sedentary lifestyle... But a whole lot of things in the game bout to change. I am walking everyday. EVERYDAY!! I will get some kind of activity. I mean I enjoy it. Even if it is just for the time alone and thinking quietly that gives me such energy and such a good attitude for the rest of the day. That alone is priceless. I will be responsible for what I place in my mouth everyday. Just eating to be eating will no longer be my standard operating procedure. I will eat fruits and vegetables and lean meats. I will stop eating so much damn fast food. Every taco counts. I will not deprive myself of the foods that I enjoy that will only push me to give up too quickly. AND Lastly but not least,cause honestly it is the most important thing for me to learn in all aspects of my life. I WILL NOT JUST TALK ABOUT IT, I WILL BE ABOUT IT!!! In the immortal words of Michael, Don't tell me what you are going to do tell me what you did. So no more talk baby its all action from here on out. I am dedicated and prepared and I will be encouraged to complete the task ahead of me.  ~Senam

      Hi tony, i am sitting here writing my journal with tony watching. He just said" I Love Senamie" I also love tony!! He is a very good little boy. Yesterday, he played baseball and did great he hit the first ball that came to him. The grownup's caught it right away but tony still rean really fast to first base. If it had bee the orioles or the diamondbacks i bet he would have mad it to first safely. After the game Michael challenged me to a race and I almost beat him but i slipped on the gravel. Totally unfair fight.....  It's about 8 hours since i wrote that last post and both Tony and Alanis are about to go to sleep thankfully they are wonderful but they sure know how to wear a sister out. I really love those two. They are really sweet and make me feel like a little kid again everytime I'm with them. They are hilarious. We had areally positive day and a good time together. I have more to say.. I want to tell you about listening to lean back and asking myself since when did it become ok for fat joe to say the N word I find it inappropiate. And how come there is some chick with an album named the same thing as my signature poem. Ain't that a B*tch!! Ok I will write more later. I am exhausted falling asleep and rambling....

      So I am still sick!!!!!!!! So sick, in fact, that even though I was miserably angry at Michael yesterday I was forced to wake him up at 1 am with crying and whining of can we go to the hospital baby please? He recognizing that if he had chosen any other option would have gotten an A+ asswhupping, he choose to promptly get out of bed and say don't worry baby it's going to be okay!!! Shiittt he knows what's up. I'm not a killa but don't test me. The big deal last night was that I had chest pains. Like unbearable,poke my eye out, why is the thing from the aliens movie trying to come out of my heart chest pains. So we went. We had a serious conversation about giving them the wrong name and social so we wouldn't get the bill. Having no health insurance sucks. It was the saddest thing but still somehow Michael and I found the humor in everything. That's why I love him we can make the worst situations funny. Even when we argue we laugh. I am going to miss him when I have to drop his punk ass. Ok ok enough of the empty threats. So when we got there u would be amazed at how many times people asked him to leave the room and gave him nasty looks of "Who are you,sir", "How are you related to her" and even asking me " Do you want him to leave" how rude? No i don't want him to leave he is the only reason why i am not bawling and crying like a fucking baby!! He has to stay!! Please leave us alone!! I don't think you all know this but Michael is white. Looks puertorican but is just plain old Jewish white. I am brown if you can't tell from the title of my blog. Straight from the west side of Ghana,West Africa. WESTSIDE!!!! I never thought of love with a white boy but I am in it and its been good so far. We have our ups and down but they have nothing to do with black and white they have everything to do with Michael and Senam Jut like any other couple. I genuinely love that man. He's good to me and calls me baby, and gives me kisses and great sex, helps me work on my organizational skills, edits all my poems, bought me my laptop, and bought me gatorade and didn't go off once even though I know he wanted to when those ladies where being all mean to him at the hospital. I mean damn just cause he's white don't mean it ain't right..

      I am so sick ya'll. I got food poisioning. I haven't been able to keep anything down for more than 30 mins. Other than that I am rocking the toliet like no other. It's like I have nocontrol over mybody!!! I'm shaking and cramping and just overall fucked up. Michael who is usually no good in these situations is not doing too bad. he bought me sprite and ginger ale and gatorade. And he's been giving me kisses and hugs all day. He's going to take me too the hospital when he gets back from work. Today I think i'll keep him. His daughter is a litte freaked out at "her senamie" throwing up every 5 minutes so everytime i come out of the bathroom she is standing there waiting to give me a hug. she takes her little hands and rubs my back. I love that little baby. She knows the trick if all else fails just give hugs. Ok I'm off to throw up my left lung. I implore you never ever ever eat Buffalo Joes chicken wings. They are the reason I can barely lift my head. oh no i've gotta go my right lung wants to go too. uuhhh....

      A month and a half ago I won the Gwendolyn Brooks Open Mic Poetry Award. I got up there and straight em up rocked it... I mean I am a rock it type chick. I rock stages for no wages for this is how poets wage war Don't ask me why I wrote that it just came to me and i wrote it but the big thing is I am not doing anything with these gifts I have been given I have a chance. I have a gift. I can sing. I can write and most importantly I love these things.  No moments make me happier than when on stage. Then why is it that I'm not doing it. Why am I not running to poetry venues. standing in line at workshops taking advantage of my chance. I am like spending whole entire weeks not working , not writing, not growing, not meditating, not praying,not reading, not sharing, not talking, just fucking around bullshit-ing.  I spend my life waiting for the next thing to do to make Michael or My mama or somebody else smile at me. WHY AREN'T I TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF SMILE!!!! Lately I've been feeling like one day I will wake up and realize that I threw my life away to be something that i never really wanted because i was too scared to get what I really wanted.  I feel like I am throwing away my chances.  I really want to sing. I want a very serious music and writing career. I want to have my own concert tours. I want to write sing and play instruments on my own and others albums. I want to write books.  I want to do what GOD has put in my heart for me to do. I will not waste time.  I don't have enough of that to spare. I got plenty of fear, I'll waste that.  Right now I muster all strength,soul, spirit I have to propel me toward steady movement toward my true goals. True happiness, true peace, true love, true sucess, true true Senam. I am God's gift and I will use the gifts that God has given me to UPLIFT. I will use my gift to uplift!!!!!
