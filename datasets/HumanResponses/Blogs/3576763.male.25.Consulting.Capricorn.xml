          by: BETO RP's online correspondent.  Summer has finally hit Chi town and its gotten really hot in this city.  In the past couple of days heat index has been well above the "hace pinche calor" factor.  This summer may have many people having the blues because of the way the economy is going.  Little mocosos (kids) may not be going on vacation because of lack of money, and some vatos may not be working as before. Plus all the beaches are closed due to bacteria and other crap that keeps the man down.  As a financial person here are some tips to make some money and to keep your self busy through out the summer.   Paletero Mechanic      For all you engineers, mechanics and auto shop that may want to make some change over the summer. Paleta (popsicles) sales skyrocket during the summer sales. All paletero carts need some massive upgrades and some repairs.  Just imagine the possibilities.  From changing paletero tires to hooking it up with some hydraulics and chrome- great ways to boost up their sales.   Independent Raspados Distributor      Raspados not just be for the kids anymore! Member those raspados you used to have when you were a chavito? Yea you member. You were always stuck with the same flavor, sherry, coco, blue, limon, chicle (bubble gum) and all flavors mixed into a raspado.  Well maybe its time to kick up raspados up a notch and get some real flavors.  How many of you ever wanted a beer raspado?  Imagine a Tecate raspado with limon and sal or even a tequila and squirt raspado.  Ideas are endless.  Hey even the kids can have them.  Prices would vary depending on the type of beer and liquor.   Carne Asada Consultant        Everyone and their momma knows that carne asadas can take a lot of work.  Nothing is worse than chilling with lighter fluid outside trying to turn on the charcoal for your carne asada. Getting beers and not having them cold enough is another problem.  Other hardships include going out to your local grocery store and waiting the lines until the carnecero (butcher) sees you and takes your order or calls your number.  Then the two dreaded question comes up "Que le doy?" (what can I get you?) - usually you ask for x lbs de aracherra, but you think "ching is 3 lbs enough?  Then the second question " La paso por la maquina?" (should I pass it through the machine?).  You quickly stall and member your mom smacking you on the head saying "Menso ju forgot to PASAR LA CARNE POR LA MAQUINA!!".  Then see other carnecero putting meat through the machine and you make the right choice.   Chihuahua! The choices you have to make.   As a carne asada consultant you can buy the needed items in bulk (cheaper and better quality). Such items may include the meat, beer, charcoal, ice and sason.  Then you can charge a nice price for delivery and material and keep a nice profit.  Just think about it and you might even end up eating great carne asada for free and having beers on the tab of your customers.    Junior Recreational Coordinator      For all you little vatos that are stuck at home playing PS2 and tired of getting yelled at for using your garden hose as a super soaker will hereÕs something for you.  For you little vatos that are trying to make a couple of bucks for your stash listen up too.  And finally for those little vatos that donÕt get to be taken to Cermak Pool this one is for you too.  No matter how old you are you can always start up your own business.  No more kool aid stands nor lemonade stands leave that to burbs.  In every block thereÕs a fire hydrant or usually called a "pump" (for you oldskool cats).  Ask around for a key usually one of your boys dad can hook up via a lil father and son project of customizing a pipe to fit over the pump valve.  Then you get all the kids from the block and charge each of them for opening up the pump.  After opening the pump make sure you take all the loot you made and the key back to a safe place.  So when the 5-0 comes by you can blame one of the gang bangers for opening up the pump. Also note that you can even try to charge cars for a quick rinse for a cheap fare.  All you have to do is "pick up the pump" (as seen in the picture above).  Well I hope this may have given you some ideas to cure them Summer time blues.  Stay tuned for more Random Pendejadas.
