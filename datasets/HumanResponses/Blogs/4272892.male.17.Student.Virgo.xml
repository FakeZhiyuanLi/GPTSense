      Well, its that time of night when I think to myself, I think "geez Rob, it's about time you actually go and do something productive with yourself" - so I might go do some homework or play the air guitar (which is awaiting sale) or something - maybe I should stare at the wall and see what patterns appear, or go on a caffeine high (hey, this blog was created while on a caffeine high!) so I'll be back...anyhows, running outta ideas to post!

      I really wanna know though:  Could Jesus cook a burger so big that even he couldn't eat it?

       Yep, I think I have chronic weirdness syndrome. However, onto the next act of the night - Quote of the Day!      This segment is basically to be dedicated to a random quote, thought, etc, that I had or heard - if you hear any others, please let me know!     Todays random statement of the day (I said it at a party on Saturday, when a mate was looking for something sharp to open a can of beer)  "That's a kindergarten next door...there's gotta be razor wire there!"  And another:  "You're the one-man cool patrol" (used as an effective insult, not a compliment, by the way)

       Another new idea - the challenge of the week!     Each week (or whatever) I'll post some sorta weird idea to try out!  This one came to me in a dream - or maybe I saw it on TV. Perhaps both. Anyhows...time for challenge of the week!  See how far you can walk backwards, before you trip over your own feet!  Geez I'm a genius! (Not really, that's just a disclaimer for no real reason)

      Following Agar's example, I decided to write a biography of your average dole bludger...  10:04 am - Wake up to smell of burning - realise I left last night's pizza in the oven. bugger.  10:17 am - Decide to fall out of bed. Find flanno under bed...hey, how long's that been here?  To be continued...  Continuing on:  10:32 am - Breakfast man! Stumble into kitchen, trip over boots in the door - since when's there been a door there?  10:33 am - Scrabblin' round desperately in the cupboard - hey, whatta ya know...Coco Pops! And they're only a few days out of date! Maaaaaad.  10:34 am - tip remains of stale Coco Pops (and some kid's trading card) into the bowl. Throw in a beer to give texture. No spoon - no problem! All I gotta do is tie my mullet back from my face and pour down throat. Done. Buuuurp. Mmmm...  10:39 am - add bowl to pile. I think I have a girlfriend hidden somewhere 'round - or did she nick off? Ah well. If all else fails, just like the bowls clean and it'll be fine for dinner.  10:46 am - Centrelink time...whoo-hoo! Trip over old TV on porch - hey, I keep it there to trip burglars up ever since the door was stolen - it'll at least slow 'em down before they get in the house and (horrified thought)...steal my frozen pizza! No wait...it's not frozen any more, it's burnt. Mmmm....  11:27 am - searchin' for car in the backyard. Where'd I leave it? Oh, yeah, that's right, it's over there - with the tarp coverin' the hole in the roof. Ain't a tarpaulin an amazing thing? And she's still got petrol! Or maybe that's kerosene. Or water. I dunno. Could be paint in the tank. Smells kinda like that party last week.  To be continued...

Caffeine Consumed....can't remember...been awake for too many weeks      Random thought of the day: "they can't break you if you don't have a spine"
