      Acordarse del Paulo es acordarse del Ardi y viceversa. Querer acordarse nadamas de uno sería como querer recordar a Batman sin Robin, al gordo sin el flaco, a un solo Polivoz, a Jose Ramón sin Ponchito, o ya de plano a Lalo sin "Lagrimita". Una de las "virtudes" que recuerdo del Paulo era la de ponerle apodos a medio mundo, cosa que hacía con tal facilidad y creatividad que nadie podría sentirse ofendido. Paulo me apodó "Flanders" una vez que me callaba estilo Homero Simpson: "cállate Flanders!", no porque le gustara callarme, sino porque le gustaba imitar voces, otra "virtud" que todos le recordamos. El Ardi por su parte tuvo la "ocurrencia" de jugarme una broma con una "ouija" de PC (todavía me la debes eh cabrón), a mi, pobre e inocente campirano de formación cristiana que prefiere creer en sus amigos antes que pensar que son capaces de hacerle una gachada. El Ardi -mitad rollero, mitad creativo, mitad mitómano- era además conocido por tener buenas viejas (o novias para que no se ofendan las feministas). Yo los recuerdo siempre haciendo reir a la banda con sus ocurrencias.

      A Mario nadamás le faltaba una túnica para parecer profeta. Su larga cabellera y su barba tupida y cerrada, su postura medio encorvada en esos casi 1.80 de estatura y una complexión delgada nada amenazante le conferían un aspecto confiable. Lo unico que lo delataba era su panza chelera, digna de un pequeño Budha (hásta en eso parece "iluminado"!). Mario es el amigo que recuerdo con más afecto y con el que, sin embargo, mantengo muy poco contacto, debe ser porque sé que está en muy buenas manos, tuve la fortuna de verlo casarse con una gran mujer (grandeza que nada tiene que ver con su estatura). Escuchar a Mario en las pláticas era como escuchar la radio, su voz por si sola ya tenía personalidad. Tal vez por eso me agradaba platicar con el. O tal vez era el hecho de que también sabe escuchar. Pobre Mario! La de veces que, como psicoanalista, tuvo que soportarme. Así recuerdo a mi amigo Mario, algo así como mi "personal  yisus ", sano, prudente, coherente, buen amigo.  Sniff!  Te extraño brother.

      Ledón es un amigo que hice en la universidad cuando estudiaba en Guadalajara, allá por mediados de los 90. Chilango de  poca madre , tuvo la fortuna de encontrarse un depa  ídem , en una esquina estilo art deco con una vista que epitomizaba nuestro tiempo, momento y lugar ( ah que mamila me escuché! ): la Minerva en el centro de López Mateos con su vecino el Fiesta Americana y sus veintytantos pisos por un lado, los Arcos de Vallarta por el otro, y una ciudad que nos rodeaba en medio de sus sueños a altas horas de la noche. Así pues, me tomo la libertad de recordar ese lugar que de noches de fiesta nos gustaba a la banda: la azotea del depa del Ledón. Cosas buenas sucedían en ese lugar (arriba y adentro en el depa) y puras buenas vibras, al menos así lo recuerdo yo, como así espero que sea este lugar, dando espacio también a las rabietas y mentadas que la cotidianedad de este país nos puedan generar. Desde aquí un nostalgico saludo al Alex y al Mario (amigos inolvidables) y un deseo porque las memorias de nuestro paso juntos por esta vida no se olviden.  Salút!

      I'm a Gemini. i'm never alone, i'm always with me. There will always be two opinons from me and most of the time they would oppose each other. I talk to myself (i don't hear voices) i just give me company and, when sad, comfort myself. Both of me share my body and mind although both have feelings, needs, and desires of their own. But i get along very well with myself.

      In jazz there is a constant dialogue between bass and drums. I remember watching the bass player and the drum player looking at each other's instruments, and sometimes just feeling them, eyes closed and an expression of almost extasis. Guitar and trumpet would follow, exchanging impressions.  Eventually an old dilemma like "what was first? The chicken or the egg?" would come to my mind, the question would be "what was first? The music coming out of the instrument or the&nbsp;inspiration of the musician?". Who inspired who?  I just sit there, listening with both ears and eyes. Jazz should also be seen to be fully appreciated.

      Lorenzo De Médicis was a great man.  Not because he was rich, but because he was humble. He was a people's man, not in the politic sense that we know now, no. He was honest, respectful, always lending a hand to help (a help not out of pity) recognizing the work of man.  Yes, he was rich, very rich, but that didn't keep him from being a humble man.  It was him who helped create the Florence of the renaissance, dealing with greater politic powers, even the Pope himself. All in order to achieve the greatness of the man, a greatness beyond riches.  Is there any man out there today willing to give something out of personal interest? Any of those so called "richest men in the world"?. After all the progress in genome medicine and the study of the human genome, Have we developed anything really significant to the cure of Cancer, Aids or Alzheimer?. No. Instead, every "pharmaceutical" corporation worldwide is fighting for the patent and company's right on everything discovered, just to later be exploited. Damn&nbsp;you corporations. Hopefully, one day, man will raise up to a new revolution, a revolution against corporations, a new renaissance.&nbsp;

      Nothing like a good cup of coffee to cheer up your day.  The sunset, a good cd, a nice blogspot to read. What else do i need right now?. Later i'll be going out for a couple of beers with some friends, and who knows? maybe i'll meet this summer's love of mine (like i have a love for every season of the year, duh!).  This morning&nbsp;i read a little, swam a little, had a little sun on my face, a little nap and woke up to a beautiful afternoon. The best things come in little portions.  It's like weekend for me from now on! So cheer up everybody and enjoy your days!

      Reading Michelangelo's biography i couldn't help thinking how wonderful those times of creativity were. Artist would gather at determined places to work and share their discoveries about new techniques of illustration and painting, there was a lot of talent gathered creating what we now know as the great art of the renaissance.   Just imagining Florence at the end of the XIII century while it was a growing city brings a feeling of greatness to my soul, a feeling hardly inspired these days, days of war, politics, lies, massive consumption, advertising, violence, corruption... you name it.   Could there be a place in this world where good things are happening? Writers discussing the current human condition and plotting the great next novel compared to Dante or Machiavello. Painters and sculptors uncovering the reality of our vanity and total indifference to human misery. Philosophers fighting behind pen and paper to discuss ethics of the world consuming corporations lusting for power no matter what. Please, i want to know.

      "What now?". Every morning i make myself that question and every day i have to work the answer out.  Yesterday's dreams and plans seem so far now and sometimes they even feel strange. How i change everyday, how different the world is everyday (yet is all the same).&nbsp;Twentyfour hours are not enough to understand this life day by day altough sometimes 24 minutes&nbsp;feel like&nbsp;an eternity.  "What now?". Tomorrow isn't even on my mind, I have to work out thru this day.

      They are both my souls incarnated, i can play with them like i needed someone to play with me when i was a kid. Maybe that's why i'm such a loner, i didn't have friends when i was their age. They are both my faces to this world, they don't hide anything, they are pure and inoccent. They love like we all should. They love me and that's all that matters to me, I love them just as much. One hugs me, the other challenges me to fight, it's all a game, a game of hugs and closeness. It's saying i love you, like a child, without words, without fear.

      Is that time of the day when the sun is so hard on you all your senses seem to fall into sleep. Makes you really want to go to sleep. An hour ago I was walking down the street with my mind going through several layers of thoughts: Drawing pictures... ranting... remembering... hiding images... projecting... planning... falling... falling... falling... Then it hit me, hot in my face, exhilarating life in form of steam and I ran. Didn't look backwards to what was after me, I only sensed it, reaching towards me. I finally woke up only to discover I was buried alive, dust was falling on my face, hands close to me, I couldn't move. And waited for death, trying to see her face in the middle of a darkness so black I couldn't hear my own heartbeat nor my thoughts. She didn't even kissed me, gave me the worst of deaths and ignored me. Three hundred years later and i'm still lying in my tomb, decomposed, dust to dust. Only I remember me and my cry for help.

      Where are you?  I waited for you in my dreams last night.  I was the actor of an unintended monologue  I fought a dragon for no reason  I woke up this morning holding only pillows (they smell like me, time to throw them in the wash machine)  New Order sounds "old statement" to me today  Coffee as a drug  Friends to remember  Lot of things behind my mind's door  Let's get started...
