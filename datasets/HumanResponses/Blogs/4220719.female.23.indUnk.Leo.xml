       Being in  urlLink Friendster  is the ‘in’ thing nowadays. No doubt, it is a great site that allows you to connect with your friends, find old ones, or meet new people with similar interests. Someone introduced me to  urlLink Friendster  last year, and much to my surprise, I’ve found nearly all my long lost friends from there. Now, I am totally hooked.  Then again, as with any online friend finder services, sometimes you’ll bump into people who are really a pain in the a** -- people who keep asking you to add them to your list of friends despite the many thousand times you rejected their requests -- sounds familiar? Of course, you can always choose to hide your profile from the world, but what if you don’t want to do that? Rather than wasting your time hitting the cancel button all the time, why not send the offending party to  urlLink Fiendster.com  -- new online community for friendster reject, a community where people can meet new people to hate or help their fiends find new enemies. It’s a pain to be sent there, really! Served them right!  So there you go --   urlLink Fiendster , the new way to hate people .  urlLink http://www.fiendster.com/

       E-mails offer many computer users online connection with friends and family.  But when it comes to right-now-and-right-here, Instant Messaging (IM) delivers the good.  Still, it can be an Instant Annoyance without the proper etiquette.  Most of the people on my IM lists decide that if I am online, then it is their duty to talk to me so much I can’t do any other thing.  And you never know when the conversation begins or ends -- you jump in and jump out with zero pleasantries.  Dos and Don’ts in the IM world   Knock before entering.  You should always establish contact with your friend first before sending them lots of messages.  Typing in all lowercase is perfectly acceptable, since it is largely used as the standard.  So, don’t be a star -- be like everyone else!  Avoid typing in all caps, unless you want the person on the other end to think you’re screaming at them.  Using caps once in a while to stress something is fine, provided you don’t go overboard.  People who don’t respond can piss you off.  So, if you are busy or need to step away from the computer, by all means, let the world know by putting up ‘customize’ status messages provided by your IM.  That’s what it’s there for.  Respect other users’ status messages.  If they say they are busy, think twice about messaging them.  If you message them anyway and they don’t respond, you don’t have the right to be angry.  Openly ignoring or avoiding someone in IM is very rude.  So, block people you don’t like.  This will prevent the offending party from seeing you online and sending you messages.    Instant Messaging shouldn’t be the main form of communication, but use it for what works.

       I am your constant companion. I am your greatest helper or heaviest burden. I will push you onward or drag you down to failure. I am completely at your command. Half of the things you do, you might just as well turn over to me, and I will able to do them quickly and correctly. I am easily managed -- you must merely be firm with me. Show me exactly how you want something done and after a few lessons, I will do it automatically.  I am the servant of all great men; and alas, of all failures as well. Those who are great, I have made great. Those who are failures, I have made failures. I am not a machine, though I work with all the precision of a machine plus the intelligence of a man. You may run me for profit or run me for ruin -- it makes no difference to me. Take me, train me, be firm with me, and I will place the world at your feet. Be easy with me and I will destroy you.  Who am I? I am habit!

       In an ideal world, we would all be able to afford first class. We'd have reclining seats, ample leg room and steak dinners. We'd have hot towels and champagne. But alas, just being able to pay for a dream trip in coach is often stretching the proverbial purse strings and the extravagance of first class is merely a pipe dream. Or is it?  Airlines often overbook their planes to ensure that they are filled to capacity on every flight. Thus substantially reducing losses incurred due to empty seats. Usually, this technique works, but sometimes, it backfires, leaving travellers stranded and unhappy. On occasion, these same airlines will offer to upgrade passengers to first class in order to free up more coach seats. You could be one of these passengers, if you plan in advance.  Dress the part of a business or first class traveller. Leave the jeans in the suitcase and wear a nice shirt and a tie. If you're a woman, try travelling in a sports jacket and dress pants. You'll be more likely to get up-graded if you look like you belong there. Always get to the ticket window early. Have everything ready, tagged and within the weight restrictions. It's okay to ask the ticketing agent if the plane is over-booked and ask if there are any free up-grades available. As long as you are polite and there's room, you could be arriving in style.  So, the plane isn't over booked and you remain in coach. Don't despair, there are a few things you can do to make your journey a little more comfortable. The absolute best seats in the house are in the emergency exit row. There is ample leg room to stretch right out and get comfortable. If these seats are all taken, try to get an aisle seat. It will make things a whole lot easier for you. On my recent long haul flight, I requested for a window seat - huge mistake.  Use an inflatable pillow to support your head and neck when you snooze to avoid waking with a stiff neck and use an airplane pillow to make a support for your lower back. Keep adequate space under the seat in front of you for the sake of your feet. Put larger bag in the overhead storage bin. Keep your feet in front of you at all times, and keep it moving. This will aid circulation and reduce fatigue, as well as decreasing your chances of suffering a potentially fatal blood clot. Stand up and move around the airplane as often as possible. On a long-haul flight, walk the aisle at least every 30 minutes.  There's nothing more exciting than seeing an air hostess wheel the food trolley your way when you've been stuck in the same seat for several hours. At least, that's how I feel. Okay, so I normally wouldn't touch a reheated frozen curry but caught in a long haul boredom and I've already paid for it, why not?  Sat in a pressurised air cabin at 30,000ft, your body is under considerable stress, with changing time zones and enforced immobility adding to the tension. As a result, it has to work harder just to function normally. The whole body expands, including your internal organs, vitamins and minerals are depleted faster than normal. If you then start shovelling down salty snacks and tucking into fat-laden fare, you'll only magnify the effects.  When you fly up, you put your body under great stress. To avoid jet lag and dehydration, the right mile-high menu is the answer. Airline food is generally not nutritious. In fact, a recent study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found 950 calories and a whopping 52 percent fat in a typical airline lunch. Not great if you are watching your weight, especially when you are unable to burn them off for hours.  The good news is that getting a more nutritious meal is easy on most long haul flights. All you need to do is ask. From dairy-free, calorie-controlled to low-carb -- if you ask when you book, you can pretty much get what you want.  Sleeping as much as possible will help you deal with jet lag. Although I personally find that hard to do when you are bound to a small little chair. Avoid alcohol and spicy foods, as well as coffee, tea and chocolate. These stimulants make the digestive system work harder and will also keep you awake.  Because of the very low humidity levels in the pressurized cabin, dehydration is another side effect of flying. It is thought to be one of the principal causes of jet lag. You may have heard it before but it is vital to drink lots of water to replace lost fluids. Make sure you avoid fizzy drinks since it may lead to bloating. Avoid alcohol too, it has a natural diuretic effect and will dehydrate you even faster.

       More than 40 years since it was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1960, "the pill" continues to be the most popular and one of the most effective forms of reversible birth control ever invented. But what happens to your body when you stop taking it?  Unlike the original oral contraceptives that women took decades ago, there are new low-dose forms that have few health risks and many health benefits. 'The pill reduces the risk of cancer of the ovaries and the womb,' says  Anne Weyman, chief executive of the Family Planning Association in the United Kingdom . 'Maintaining levels of estrogen in the body combats osteoporosis.' Despite the fact that it is safe for most women, the pills do carry some health risk. For example, if you are over 35 and smoke or have certain medical conditions (a history of blood clots or breast or endometrial cancer), you may be advised against taking them.  The pill, a synthetic form of estrogen and progesterone, the body’s own hormones works by suppressing ovulation – the monthly release of an egg from one of the ovaries. When you come off the pill, it takes the body a while to think of itself again. This doesn't mean the pill reduced your fertility. According to  Dr Anne Szarewski, clinical medical officer at the Margaret Pyke Center , the pill enable women to put off having children until their late thirties. But at this age, fertility is significantly reduced anyway. Women often forget this and then blame the pill for difficulties in becoming pregnant.  Some studies indicate taking the pill for a long period may actually improve women's subsequent fertility. Researchers at Bristol and Brunel universities found women who took the pill for more than five years had a greater chance of becoming pregnant, possibly because of protective mechanism the pill may provide. But it does take a long time for the body to re-regulate itself -- 18 months is not uncommon.  Many women report their sex drive increases when they came off the pill. This may be because the pills lower your levels of testosterone, the hormone responsible for sex drive.   The three most common types of birth control pills are:   Progestin-only Pills (POP): Also known as the mini pill. It contains no estrogen at all. Ideal for breast-feeding women because estrogen reduces milk production. However, the mini pill are not as effective at preventing pregnancy as the combination pill (pill that contains both estrogen and progestin).  Combination Pills: When you hear the term 'birth control pill,' it most often refers to those containing two hormones. Each pill in the pack is a combination of estrogen and progestin.  Emergency Contraceptive Pill (ECP): Also known as the morning after pill. ECP are not intended for conventional birth control use, but rather they can help prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. It is taken in 2 doses. The first must be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. The second dose 12 hours later.   As with any medication, there are benefits and risks to using the pill. But, many women know more about the health risks -- or the health myths -- and don’t know about the benefits. Here’s the scoop…  Health benefits of birth control pills:   Pregnancy Prevention. Birth control pills are one of the most effective forms of reversible birth control. It is also important to realize that birth control pills prevent not only normal pregnancies, but also those that begin outside the uterus.  Menstrual benefits. Birth control pills provide at least four benefits related to a woman's period. Generally, pill users find improvement in their menstrual patterns because the timing is controlled by the pills. The pill also reduces menstrual flow and it's effective at relieving pelvic pain during menstruation.  Protection from cancer. Many fear that using the pill will cause cancer. Truth is, birth control pills have been shown to protect women from ovarian and endometrial cancer, and possibly from colorectal cancer.  Prevention of bone density loss. A study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in 1991 found that, of nearly 2,300 women, those with high bone density were more likely to have been pill users.  Protection from ovarian cysts. The Oxford University/Family Planning Association found that pill users have less risk of developing ovarian cysts than women who used non hormonal methods of contraception.   Health risks of birth control pills:   Heart Attack. While some studies find no association between heart attack and use of the pill, one U.S. study, published in the  American Journal Obstetrics and Gynecology  in 1996, found a small correlation: less than three additional heart attacks per million American women in one year are birth control pill users.  Migraines and stroke. Combined oral contraceptive users with a history of migraine are faced with greater risk of stroke than non users.  Worsening of severe diabetes. The estrogen in birth control pills may increase glucose levels while decreasing the body’s insulin response and the progestin in the pills may encourage overproduction of insulin. Women with normal blood sugar levels won’t develop diabetes but diabetic women who should avoid the pill include those who have experienced vascular damage or have had the disease for longer than 20 years.  Possible acceleration of gallbladder disease. Estrogen may cause bile to become over-saturated with cholesterol, which can lead to gallstone development. However, an analysis of 25 studies on the subject found that the increased risk for gallbladder disease among birth control pill users was not statistically significant.  Drug interactions with birth control pills. Do you know of a woman who claimed to use birth control pills correctly but got pregnant anyway? Oftentimes the blame is placed on a short stint of antibiotic use. Reports abound regarding the reduction in pill effectiveness caused by antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline. It is clear that some drugs can reduce pill effectiveness. If you are taking any drugs on a short-term basis, you can use a backup method (such as condoms).  Nausea, vomiting, headaches and/or spotting, which will go away after the first few cycles.   To determine if birth control pills are right for you, it’s important to understand the advantages, disadvantages and the side effects. As with any medication, it’s also important to consider your existing health and any other medications you’re taking before starting a new one. It is important to consult with a health care professional about the pros and cons of any form of birth control you are considering.

       Whatever happened to civilization? Whatever happened to polite, courteous and friendly Malaysians? You are not imagining it, bad behavior is all around us these days. Rudeness seems to be taking a bit of a breather. A man light a cigarette in a non smoking area, a woman swoops in front of you at the check out counter, salesperson who follows you around looking as if you are going to steal something or salesperson who looks you up and down before deciding to ignore you altogether because she thinks you are only a waste of time – sounds familiar? Not forgetting bad manners drivers and nosy people who like to ask rude questions, such as, “Why aren’t you married?”  Internet poll was conducted recently asking if people are ruder to one another now than they were 10 years ago. A whopping 79 percent said yes. And comparing to most western countries, Malaysians are getting much worst by the day.  I’ve recently traveled to the United Kingdom and it’s interesting to see how different their cultures are with Malaysia. I’ve expected to meet proud and egoistical people – people who look highly on themselves, but no, most of them are in fact, very friendly and helpful. I had a few pleasant experiences myself. Like the time when I was looking at buses timetable, an old man approached and asked whether I needed any help. Getting on the bus, I told the driver where I was going, he looked at me and asked, “do you know where to stop?” and when I said no, he told me he’d let me know and he did. It’s interesting to see that they took the initiative to help before I even ask for one. Should I be in Malaysia, almost guaranteed I would have to find my own way. Shopping was another great experience. They make you feel welcomed and not intimidated. The salesperson will go to great length helping customer choosing the right outfit, and even when you didn’t buy anything, they still thank you with a smile – a gesture which not many Malaysians will do nowadays.  Yet, Malaysians claimed that sincerity and politeness are part of their culture. Question is, really? Oh yeah… but when they did, take a look around and you’ll probably spot a ‘white’. De JA vu! So why can’t we, fellow Asians, get the same treatment? I am not sure I’ll ever find a satisfying answer to that question.  What do you do when you are faced with rude people? Do you snap back or stay silent? Personally, I think neither response would be helpful. Staying silent often encourages more unacceptable behaviors and snapping back could result into an even nastier exchange. But then again, sometimes it’s best just to let it go.

       1. People who point at their wrist while asking for the time. I know where my watch is pal, where the heck is yours?? Do I point at my crotch when I ask where the toilet is??  2. People who are willing to get off their butts to search the entire room for the tv remote because they refuse to walk to the tv and change the channel manually... Really, its not that hard.  3. People who taste/smell something horrible, nearly puke, then turn to the person beside him/her and say "OMG this is awful!!! Here, taste/smell it!" Geez people, if it's that bad, spare me.  4. When people ask, "Are you sleeping??" and continue to talk to you until you answer them. Its the most pointless question ever in my opinion.  5. When people say while watching a film, "Did you see that?" No idiot!, I just paid $9 to come to the cinema and stare at the floor.  6. People who ask, "Can I ask you a question?" Didn't really give me a choice there, did you sunshine?  7. When something is "new and improved!" Which is it? If it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it. Doh!   8. When people say, "Life is short." What the.....!! Life is the longest darn thing anyone ever does!! What can you do that's longer?   9. When someone wacks you in the shin or something like that and you keel over in pain and all they can say is, "OMG are you okay??" Well thanx for the concern... I might be okay in a couple hours when the throbbing pain that's quickly making its way up my leg fades away... What the hell do they think?!
