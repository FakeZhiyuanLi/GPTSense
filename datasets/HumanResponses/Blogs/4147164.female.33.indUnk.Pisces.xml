        Subtitle:  My Alien Abduction    About a week ago, I coerced a stranger into giving me his Super Diamond concert tickets. Super Diamond, for the unenlightened, is a Neil Diamond cover band. Yes, you read that correctly—there is a real live band out there that covers Neil Diamond! Amazing.  I sent out a mass mailing offering up a ticket to the first person to respond and was deluged with responses. No, I’m fibbing—only ONE person e-mailed me saying they’d like to go. What’s wrong with the rest of you?!!!  At any rate, last night was the big night, and I was sooo excited! Or at least, I was—until I returned home from rowing and discovered that my ‘date’ had to cancel. I made several emergency phone calls trying to track down a friend. As luck would have it, I reached Andy, Mr. Spontaneity himself, and found someone eager to experience this cultural phenomenon.  The band was playing at Scene Pavilion, and when we arrived, it was standing room only. Again, I’m lying—it was the smallest concert I’ve ever attended. This turned out to be a good thing. We charged up front to the area I’m usually barred from, because I always purchase the cheapest tickets. We were within 10 feet of the band.  The sparkly Vegas-style outfits, the lyrics of Neil, the energy of the crowd, and the agreeable weather all made for a great time. Although I had expected to be one of the youngest people there, that was not the case at all. We found that except for a few bluehairs, we were in the same age group as the vast majority of attendees. Go figure.  Although the entire experience was fun, I think that the highlight for me was when Super Diamond walked off stage at the end of the concert. This is typically the point where the audience screams for 5 minutes to get the band back for an encore. Super Diamond was having none of it—they waited about 10 seconds, fearful that the audience would disappear—and came back for a rousing finish that ended with the classic, "Coming to America". What a blast!  Not ready for such a promising night to be over, we decided to head on over to Hoopple’s to see the Schwartz Brothers play. The band was—as always—fantastic, and the frontman was—per usual—his inflammatory self. At one uncomfortable juncture in the evening, he yelled at Andy for pointing at him and then made a comment about ‘the airhead sitting next to you’. ME. Harrumph. Thankfully, the spotlight didn’t last on us too long. We stayed another hour or so and then headed from home.  And here, my friends, is where things got very strange. I dropped Andy off, made a late-night run to Taco Bell, sat in bed eating nachos and watching a TV movie about Michael Jackson, and then went to sleep.  When I woke up, my upper body was wracked with pain. My toe was purple, swollen, and I believe, broken. These injuries appear to defy explanation. I can only conclude that yet again, the aliens abducted me to conduct experiments on my body. They then obviously gave me some type of memory-altering substance so I would not recall how I was injured.  To explain—about 2 weeks ago I was suffering from inexplicable ass pain. It persisted for a few days, and I could never determine the cause. I know what you’re probably thinking, but no foreign object had come remotely close to my ass. Why then, was sitting painful? I remembered a non-fiction book that I had read back in college about someone who was periodically abducted by aliens so they could probe his body. Upon recalling this tale, I knew that what I was experiencing was the awful aftermath of an alien anal probe.  It actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it. The mysterious injuries, the purple bruises that I frequently wake up with it. Refer to the list, specifically items 34 &amp; 35:  urlLink http://anw.com/aliens/52questions.htm   If anyone else has had a similar encounter, please share it with me. You are not alone out there.

      I decide to return to the Psychic Workshop for Day 2, primarily because I am not hungover. Since I am reasonably functioning, there seems to be no reason to skip it.  We begin Day 2 discussing some of the experiences people had the day before. Then, we’re ready to move on to the Walk-In & Wanderer probe. Basically, a wanderer is a soul who has incarnated from a more advanced civilization but who came to Earth for whatever reason. Dicks suggests perhaps they got demoted which gets a big laugh. A walk-in occurs when your soul gets totally fed up and has another soul take over for the duration of your life.  We probe our inner conscious to determine whether we fit into any of these categories. Again, I don’t feel much of anything. My impression is that I am a wanderer, based on the characteristics of wanderers that Dick shared with us prior to the hypnosis. But, I don’t really know if this is some type of psychic knowledge or a guess. I suspect it’s the latter, and I go outside for a cigarette break.  By this time, I am very frustrated and very depressed. Although I am not having any enlightening psychic experiences, people are literally having amazing visions all around me. As everyone else’s psychic ability seems to be growing, my miniscule ability has atrophied. I trust less and less in the process and feel more and more that I am too neurotic to  ever  relax enough to reach Theta. Worse is that every break, people all around me are asking me what psychic experience I had—they give me these sympathetic little smiles when I recount that yet again, nothing happened, I spent most of the hypnotic session thinking about how much my ass hurt.  When I’m not thinking about my ass (like how can it be so well-padded yet so sore at the same time?), I have ample time to reflect on the state of my life, and this brings me down even more. I’ve put on weight, my finances are the worst they’ve been in the past year, my house is a mess, I’m drinking too much, not spending enough time with Sierra, I hate my job, etc. I consider leaving the workshop, but then my codependency kicks in and I worry that Dick &amp; Tara will feel like they are doing a bad job if someone takes off mid-session. So, I stay.  While smoking, I begin telling another participant, Susan, why I came to the workshop in the first place. I mention that when I saw a psychic in June, he told me that he could see me making one bad man choice after another and having a miserable life until my death as a result; Bill, the psychic, also mentioned that my past-life experiences are part of the reason I’m choosing these inappropriate men in this life. I was hoping that I could gain some insight on that issue which is why I decided to attend the workshop, even though I was cynical that I would have any psychic experiences.  No lying—what Bill said to me shook me to the core. Since I feel like I’ve wallowed in a great deal of misery already, I was very upset to hear that there was a possibility I'd experience ongoing misery until my death. I mean, yuck, who wants to hear that?!!! I’d even started going to Codependents Anonymous meetings, trying to fix myself, and hating the very idea of them. Sitting around discussing my inner child with a bunch of stangers somewhat surprisingly, has no appeal. Go figure. But, I digress.  When Susan and I return from the cigarette break, I find that our group is scheduled to do psychometry next. Psychometry is a matter of reading the emanations of an object an individual possesses, such as a piece of jewelery. I’m totally depressed anyways, and I’m freaked when I realize we have to select a partner, and once again, my absolute embarrassing lack of psychic skills will be exposed to another person.  Dick doesn’t relieve my discomfort at all when he mentions a psychic who touched a bracelet at a pawn shop and literally jumped back because the bracelet contained so many negative vibrations. I wonder if my partner will recoil at what she perceives from my jewelery.  I select the woman sitting next to me, Donna, as my partner. I haven’t spoken to her at all, because she did not attend the first day of the workshop. It turns out that I’ve made a good selection, because Donna is a  real  psychic. And, a plug for her, she hosts her own radio show, Psychic Sushi, on 1300AM from 7-8 on Mondays. I handle her ring, and she takes one of my earrings. I’m relieved when she doesn’t flinch when her fingers touch it.  We go into a trance-like state, and again, I perceive almost nothing. Donna, on the other hand, has picked up a lot about me. As soon as we can open our eyes again, the first thing she says is, "Your grandma wants me to tell you that you WILL have a good relationship." I almost burst into tears. I’m so touched that my grandma has been looking out for me. It makes me feel so much better to think that somebody on the other side is actually paying attention to me down here. Plus, I am just so happy that she addressed the whole relationship thing, because it had been weighing so heavily on my mind. It was, after all, the primary reason I came to the workshop in the first place.  Then, Donna tells me that she sees an engagement ring and a wedding to Dave (someone with brown hair, brown eyes, name starts with a ‘D’ in a couple years). I was really surprised because although that’s certainly been discussed, nothing conclusive has ever been determined. I asked her if the wedding is just one possibility or if it’s a definite. Donna responds that it’s a definite. Smile :-)  She then tells me that she sees me returning to school for another degree (which I’ve been wanting to do but wondering how I’ll pay for it) and possibly working with kids. She could tell that I’m unhappy at my current job and she sees a new job for me in about 2 years that I’ll like much better (hey, just what the other psychic said!). She also—and this came as a shock—sees Dave and I moving. She didn’t say where, although she did ask if I have any connection to Pennsylvania. I was actually born in PA, so I’m not sure if she was picking up that or if she thought that’s where she saw us moving.  Donna also said (just as the last psychic did) that she foresees my father in the hospital for some type of upper body problem. But, she assured me that ‘they’ (whoever ‘they’ are) wanted me to know not to worry, my dad will be fine.  The rest of what she had to say was about Dave, and it made me think that he must have some really noisy spirit guides feeding these psychics information! This is the second psychic reading I’ve had and I swear, they focus more on him than on me. She asked me if he had been in past trouble for drinking, and she said, "They’re showing me a lot of glasses being lifted up, a lot of martini glasses." I find this soooooo funny, because yes, that man can DRINK. Certainly, he’s on a par with me, if not in a class all on his own.  She then asks if he is manic-depressive, and I tell her that yes, I believe so. She said that ‘they’ (again, ‘they’) want me to know that Dave is going to be fine, but he should get some drugs/counseling for the manic depression thing once he’s released from prison. She also suggested that a change in diet might not hurt either, because food allergies can exacerbate problems like that.  All in all, it gave my day a much-needed boost. I’m getting married, I’m leaving Ohio, I’m going back to school, and I’m going to have a job that I like much better. It just sounded so perfect. I have to say that it made me wonder if the spirits were blowing smoke up my ass to lift me out of my   blue   mood, but I’m hoping my gram didn’t lie :-)  Of course, this is all very curious, because the last psychic saw Dave being in &amp; out of prison for the rest of his life. What to think? I feel that both of these people I saw were legitimately psychic so how to reconcile the differences? I have 2 theories. The first is that all psychics do is present possible futures. We all have free will and those futures can be altered. Maybe within the past few months, Dave and I have unknowingly done something to alter our futures. Alternatively, I think maybe one of our spirit guides petitioned the council for some changes in our life chart (for those not following, go buy a Sylvia Browne book), because both of us deserve some happiness. Regardless, the reading was very uplifting, and I felt much better afterward.  I didn’t feel quite so awful when I had to tell Donna what I ‘saw’ in her—uh, basically, I could picture her cat and I saw a trip. I did describe her cat accurately, and she was planning a trip in 2 weeks, but I got not one iota more than that. Hopefully, she wasn’t too disappointed, because I felt really happy with the information she gave me!  We concluded the session with a future progression hypnosis. Basically, you step outside of time and perceive what is to come. Dick progressed the room to look at the state of the nation 4 months ahead, 8 months ahead, 12 months ahead, and finally, ahead to the year 2012 (the year the Mayan calendar ends). For those of you who don’t like spoilers, I suggest you stop here.  For the rest of you, I thought this was  really  cool stuff! People said they saw the price of gas going up a lot (like beyond $3!) and some type of issue with China—unfortunately, although a lot of people mentioned China, nobody said what the issue was. Donna said that she sees some type of problem with the election—like, it’s not going to take place on the date it’s supposed to, a year later people are still going to be angry about it, basically, something weird with the election. She did mention that she thinks Kerry will be President in the end (good news, fellow Dems!).  What was really interesting though was the progression to 2012. A couple people had the same insight about Niagara Falls—that something is going to happen that will cause the Falls to cease to exist. The indication seemed to be that it would be an environmental problem, rather than an act of terrorism.  By far though, the most common vision that people had were problems with the planets in 2012. Solar flares that are larger than have ever been seen before, extensive problems that will be shown on the news. Donna saw a flashing marquis that said, ‘DON’T GO TO MARS!’. Someone else jotted down a sentence while she was in an altered state, and when she awoke, it said something to the effect of, "Beware. The planets are dangerous." Dick expressed that a lot of people were having this vision and frankly, he seemed to imply, ‘hey folks, that’s probably the end’, but Tara took a more optimistic view. Or maybe she didn’t want to scare the hell out of everyone and so ended the workshop on a lighter note.  At any rate, although I wish I had some amazing psychic experience of my own to share, it was not to be. However, in a very roundabout way, I did get what I was seeking out of the workshop—affirmation from my grandma that I will not have a lifetime of miserable relationships to look forward to.  Thanks, Gram—I love you :-)

      Interested in exploring my psychic potential, I signed up for a 2-day psychic workshop that took place this past weekend. The workshop, taught by Dick and Tara Sutphen, offered hypnosis to put the participants in an altered (Theta) state of consciousness before trying various psychic techniques, including telepathy, clairvoyance, past-life regression, etc.  I arrived at the Beachwood Marriott on Saturday morning, eager for the day to begin. Dick started out the session by asking the participants how many felt that they already had some psychic ability and just wanted to develop it further? My hand was one of the few that remained down. Uh oh. I felt like a total lame right off the bat. As the weekend went on, I realized that most of the people who signed up were  already  gifted psychics who just wanted to hone their skills.   I am out of my league here.  Dick then explains to us that people frequently experience psychic flashes of intuition, but they discount them, not believing in their accuracy. He emphasizes that the key to developing your psychic ability is trust. Don’t disregard your intuition, trust in what you visualize. OK, trust.  I decided to try it, even though I’ve come to believe that like George Costanza, virtually every instinct I have is wrong; my life might be managed better if I did the opposite of what my gut told me to do in any given situation. I try to suspend this type of thinking for the duration of the workshop.  It only takes the first telepathic session for me to realize that yes, much of my instinct is wrong. As I sit with a partner and we try to articulate what we’ve telepathically learned about each other, it is a comedy of errors.  "Do you live in a split-level house?"  "No, I don’t. Are you married?"  "No, I’m single. Do you work in an office?"  "No, I’m unemployed. Do you take care of an elderly person?"  "Uh-uh."  It would have been mortifying, save for the fact that she was just as unskilled as I was at telepathic reading.  From there, we moved on to another telepathic game. Dick would draw a symbol from an envelope, and then he and Tara would telepathically try to send us a picture of the image. Apparently, being ‘close’ but not exact can be considered a hit. I had 2/3 hits. I perceived one symbol so closely that I actually gasped when I saw Dick display it to the room.  As it turns out, this is the first and last time I displayed any psychic ability throughout the entire workshop. I suppose this makes sense, as Dick explains that telepathy is the easiest psychic talent to develop. When the telepathy session concludes, we adjourn for lunch and then return to more sophisticated psychic games.  In the afternoon, we try automatic writing and past-life regression. I decide that part of the reason my psychic powers are failing me is because I am too uncomfortable to completely relax in the chair I’m sitting in. Several of us move to the floor for the automatic writing session. This turns out to be a mistake. Sitting on the floor for 45 minutes is about as comfortable as resting on a slab of concrete. The automatic writing session seems endless, and I am not hypnotized. I keep opening my eyes and peeking around to see what everyone else is doing. I seem to be the only slacker.  I write copiously in my notebook like all of the others sitting near me. However, as they are channeling spirits, I am channeling my inner discontent. My notebook consists of 2 pages of variations of the same phrase, "My ass hurts. How much longer will this last?"  Once this is complete, people begin sharing their experiences. I keep mum, but I glare at a few people’s backs when they begin to recount their far more exciting channeling experiences. One person channeled John Denver and John wrote a song through him which he proceeded to read to the class. I smile when he finishes recounting this experience, although inwardly, I murmurred an ‘overachieving asshole’. I am green.  From there, we move on to past-life regressions. I begin to realize that my body adamantly  refuses  to enter the Theta state. I am far too neurotic and too anxious to ever relax to that point without the aid of drugs. I regret not realizing this $150 sooner.  As with the other sessions, past-life regression is a wash for me. Other people tell great stories about their past lives.   For instance, one gentleman had suffered pain for years in the middle of his back. As he was being regressed, he recalled a life where he was shot with an arrow in that same location. The pain never returned for the rest of the workshop. Intriguing.  As Day 1 ends, I wonder whether I should bother returning for the next session. I leave undecided and figure I’d play it by ear.

      Had plans on Friday evening but I decided to take a nap before I went out.  Unfortunately, I am one of those people who _cannot_ set a timer for nap-taking.  If I do, I toss and turn, stressing out, wondering if I'll be able to actually fall asleep before the alarm goes off.  So, I optimistically got into bed at 6:15, thinking that I'd wake up in time to still enjoy my Friday.  But noooooooooooo....woke up at 2AM, my entire Friday GONE.  Now, I'm just killing time until the rest of the world wakes up.  This sucks :P

      I have so many thoughts running through my head that I’d like to write about, yet so little time to actually commit any of these ideas to my blog! Unfortunately, it’s too difficult to type while holding a Bud Light and a lit cigarette…  But, here’s a thought that keeps returning over and over again…Outback Jack. Is he the quintessential male or what? Sensitive (he cries!) and yet rugged at the same time. I actually saw him snack on an ant’s ass a few shows ago. Now that’s a REAL man.  If Natalie and he ever split, I’ll happily make my home in the Outback. I could probably go on for many paragraphs about my attraction to Jack, but I'll refrain because I know not everyone is as enamored with him as I am...  Moving on... Last night after rowing with my crew, I went to Hoopple’s, one of my new favorite bars. They have a blues band every Thursday that is  amazing , and if you can ignore the singer’s tendency to preach from the stage, it’s really a great time. While I was there, I met the bass player, Gene.  Gene impressed me, because he strikes me as one of those few people who is actually living out his dream. He plays music and races cars for a living. What a life! He truly enjoys what he does, and really, how many of us can say that?  It got me thinking about how fulfilling life has the potential to be, if you find work that inflames your passion. Like, what would life be like if I actually woke up and felt enthused about coming to my job? If I couldn’t wait, because I really found meaning in what I did? Is sacrificing the almighty dollar worth it for workplace joy?  It’s a lot to think about. It’s kind of a moot issue at this point, as I have a kid and a mortgage right now. But, 15 years from now, I may have to seriously consider ‘dropping out’, living a very simple (i.e. poor) life that inspires me. Kudos to those of you who have already taken that big step. I’m still working on finding the courage to make that leap…
