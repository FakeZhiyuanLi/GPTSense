      I am going to find a way to get audience input about the games that are discussed. I, Aequinoctialis, will sumbit any inquerys that I cannot answer myself to a good friend to be known as immortalis. I am equality and he is the deathless one, we shall reign sumpreme in the gaming world... Muhahaha, muhaha, muha....

      An Introduction to an Experiment on the Role of the Unique Seed Coats of Plants in the Genus Passiflora  Passiflora are a unique and diverse group of flowering plants. Passiflora are in fact so unique that these plants are the only group of plants that play host to the feeding larvae of some rare butterflies known as Heliconia butterflies. This amazing relationship that these plants share with the butterflies has warranted research in institutions world wide. This is one reason that Passiflora plants must be preserved. The Heliconia butterflies make up a substantial population of some of the most exotic butterflies that would be lost forever without the existence of Passiflora and without the existence of the heliconia butterflies the same would be true of the Passiflora. Many biologists specializing in butterfly research, called a Lepidopterist, have been researching what they believe is an ancient ancestry of co-evolution. The rarity of the occurrences of suspected Long term co-evolution has raised questions that scientists are hard at work to answer. But what does this have to do with the seeds of Passiflora? Passiflora seeds are sporadic in their germination time and are highly prone to becoming unviable. And as many know the rainforests are being burned, cut, and plowed down at an amazing rate; doe to this rapid loss of land some of the species of Passiflora are becoming rarer, and rarer. A few species of Passiflora subgenus Astrophea grow as medium trees, expressing no tendrils at any point. And all of these arboreal Passiflora are endangered of extinction. Two of these tree species have leaves that exceed one meter in length, one is named Passiflora tica. These tree passiflora are near impossible to grow in captivity, and are semi woody stemmed making vegetative propagation nearly impossible as well. And since these plants are endangered it is very difficult to acquire seeds that can be safely replanted in the forest and be expected to survive.  Passiflora were originally discovered by Spanish catholic missionaries in southern America. The first Passiflora discovered in 1569 was discovered by a Spanish doctor in Peru named Monardes These plants, only later known as passiflora, were interpreted in 1609 by by Jacomo Bosio in Rome, as representing various elements of the Crucifixion. They thought that the ten petals represented the apostles, minus Judas and Peter, and the corona (or crown) represented the crown of thorns. They went further making analysis to the 5 stigmas representing the five wounds Christ received, and the 3 stamens represented the nails.  Other religions however did not see the correlation, as consequence the Asiatic countries tended to refer to the plant as the clock plant, believing it somehow resembled a clock and its hands.  Since then passiflora have been discovered on many different continents and on various different islands. The geographic diversity of the genus passiflora ranges from sea level Bahamian shores to Andean mountain peaks thousands of feet high. Due to the great variance in location there is also a great degree of the range of temperature at which these plants can grow.  They range from and ability to handle 30 degree Fahrenheit minimums to only being able to survive above temperatures of 50 degrees Fahrenheit. This has made a great deal of problems in growing a wide variety of passiflora in one location. In most cases people who grow passiflora need several, around three, different areas with substantially different microclimates to be able to be successful with a great diversity of these plants.   Passiflora are commonly raised by butterfly farmers, commercial juice makers, and hobbyist growers. So understanding how the seeds of this genus work is an important step in knowing how to save the lesser known and more in danger species. What currently is know is that Passiflora are generally herbaceous, occasionally tending to form woody tissue and possibly a corky bark. Stipules can be present but are not always. Most passiflora  are considered lianas but a small number are arboreal. Leaves can be lanceolate or palmate between 2 and 11 times, sometimes only twice lobed leaves are considered ‘bat-winged’.  Stems are tri-lacunar and the axial buds, along with the leaves are alternate. It has been observed that the seeds of plants within the genus Passiflora have a very odd dimpling across the entire outer coat of their seeds. This has raised the question: what is the function of the seed coat? And from that question it has been proposed that the seed coat has some ability to allow only certain chemicals to enter or leave the seed as the large surface area must facilitate some larger amount of chemical processes. This experiment is meant to compare the amounts of water in its liquid and gaseous states enter the seed. The Hypothesis is then boiled down to this: the structure of the seed coats of the plants within the genus Passifloraceae is meant to only allow gaseous water to imbibe into the seed as the dimpling must increase the surface area to allow for the sparse amounts of air locked H2O to quickly enter the seed. This hypothesis has been derived due to the fact that passiflora seeds can be very difficult to germinate. The reason they are hard to germinate is because they become unviable when left in low humidity as they ‘dry out’. Also a passiflora seed that is submerged in soil is far less likely to germinate that a seed that is placed on top of the soil or just barely below it. If a passiflora seed has a damaged seed coat and is soaked in water the seed will burst and die. All of these evidences have led me to believe that the seed coat prevents imbibing of liquid water so the plant can’t get washed away and/or killed during a rainy season and allows only the imbibing of gaseous water so the seed will germinate shortly after the rain when the humidity is sufficient to keep the seedling alive.  The proposed experiment deals with ten jars and ten samples of seeds. Four of the jars will be each partially filled with water (distilled). One jar will have submerged coated seeds; one jar will have submerged coatless seeds. One jar will have suspended coated seeds; one jar will have suspended coatless seeds. This pattern will be repeated except with mineral water. Then 2 of the jars will be used for controls, having no water and containing (in one jar) coated seeds and (in the other jar) coatless seeds. The jars will all be sealed and kept in a heated area. The heat will be high enough to raise the absolute humidity up to 100%. 100% Absolute humidity is reached when there is so much water in the air that the water begins to condensate due to over concentration. The seeds will then be observed over time to determine whether it is the seed coat or the humidity or both that effect germination the most.

      Section A Give a calendar countdown to the end of your high school year preceding college, including test dates, college application dates etcetera…   Section B What are your short term Future goals? (5 years from now)  My short term goals are as follows. I want to leave high school with my diploma and immediately get a job and work for a year or two. After I have some Job experience and some financial stability I will attend a community college for my associates and re-enter the work force to pay my college fee’s and start building a foundation for my future business plans.  Section C  Whitman College, Walla Walla Washington Reed College, Portland Oregon Clark community, Vancouver Washington Four-year private $19,710 Four-year public $4,694 Two-year public $1,905  Clark appeals to me because I know that I don’t have good enough grades to get scholarships but I know I can afford my way through a community school. And also I only really want my associates so I can start a business some time. I want to take Plant/nursery operations c, Small business operation c, Horticultural services a, or something of the like. There is no travel and my normal pre-established living costs (I will be able to get an idea of these costs while working) will be applied.  Section D    Section F    Section g

      Nolan Hayes Junior English, pd. 4 April 30, 2004  Junior Research Outline  Hypothesis: Passiflora seeds have developed a hard, high surface area, & water impermeable coating that should disallow the movement of water into the seeds to germinate, the high surface area and resistance to liquid movement suggests that passiflora seeds are not activated to germination by the presence of liquid, but by the presence of humidity.  I.	Introduction: Precursor to my experiment, what is passiflora and why should I care about their seeds? a.	Historical documentation i.	Where were passiflora First discovered – Peru. ii.	Who first discovered passiflora – The first Passiflora discovered in 1569 by a Spanish doctor in Peru named Monardes. He took plants back to the old world where it became a popular tea. Passiflora was first described by the missionaries of New Spain. They were referred to as the passion plant or ‘passion of Christ’ due to the numerical relation the plant had with certain biblical events. These were interpreted in 1609, by Jacomo Bosio in Rome, as representing various elements of the Crucifixion, five petals and five sepals (the ten disciples, minus Judas & Peter); outer fringe (the crown of thorns); five stamens (number of wounds Christ received) & knob-like stigmas of the pistil (the nails). b.	Classification i.	How many were first classified – There were only 22 species that were recognized by Linnnaeus, the father of binomial nomenclature, in the 1745. Now there is thought to be about 600 species, whereas only 488 have been recognized by John Vanderplank; the leading expert on passiflora classification. c.	Distribution i.	Where do Passiflora grow? - The distribution of Passiflora ranges from the arid deserts California and Texas west to North Carolina and south to the very tip of Chile. They are native to Africa, turkey, to India and Asia. For every tropical region there is either a native species or an invasive one. d.	Cultivation i.	Who currently cultivates Passiflora? - Now-a-days Passiflora are cultivated by a large number of lepidopterists grow Passiflora to feed a very specific, rare, and valuable butterfly; the heliconious. A wide array of other people grow Passiflora specifically for their exquisite flowers and intrigue.  ii.	How long have passiflora been cultivated? – Passiflora have been cultivated in England since the late 1700’s to the early 1800’s and the first Passiflora hybrid was made in 1820 between P. caerulea and P. violaceae it was named P x kewensis after the royal botanical gardens of kew. iii.	How are passiflora cultivated and why? – Passiflora are generally classified into three groups: house plants, conservatory plants, hot house or heated conservatory plants.  House plants are excellent when grown at or around room temperature. Conservatory plants need slightly warmer temperatures ranging from 55˚f to 70˚f, and hot house plants need an excess of 65˚ all the time. Passiflora need moist but not damp soil all of the time and some are temperamental of light where as others thrive in dim conditions. Passiflora can be grown outdoors in most southern states of the US and are often cultivated for their fruits and fruit juices. Occasionally Passiflora are cultivated for their alkaline leaves that are used in herbal medicine. e.	Conservation i.	Why should we conserve passiflora? – Passiflora are suppliers of certain types of holistic healing and are used as food plant and supply a large quantity of the juices that Americans consume. However by understanding these plants better the production of commercial fruits can be increased and the market may be able to afford supplying fresh fruit to local markets. ii.	What is the current danger to native passiflora species? – Currently passiflora are most endangered by deforestation and climate changes, plants that are most at risk are the two incredibly hard to cultivate arboreal varieties which to this day are incredibly threatened. f.	Germination i.	Why should I care about how it is that a passiflora seed readies itself to germinate? – By knowing how the seed works scientists, horticulturists, and conservationists may have better luck growing and reestablishing the population of the rare and endangered species of this genera.  II.	Procedure a.	The experiment will begin with two test groups of seeds obtained freshly from the same plant. The two test groups will be equal in volume and in overall weight. The seed numbers will be determined by the availability of the seeds, and each seed will constitute one trial. They will each be put into separate jars of the same make and having the same volume. The jars will then be filled about half way with the same volume of water. One of the seed groups will be placed into jar 1 (J1) and be submerged under the water. The second group of seeds will be placed in jar 2 (J2) and will be suspended above the water. The containers (J1 and J2) will both be sealed and then placed on a heat mat that will heat the containers to a temperature which is considered ideal for passiflora germination. (Now each jar contains the same volume of water and air, the same volume and density of seeds, and each having the same over all temperature and light applied to each) The jars will be observed for a period of days which will be determined by the rate of passiflora seed germination in each jar.

      Ahhh... Finaly things have settled down enough I can start posting. Just this previous tuesday (may 25) I was on a field trip to Mt. ST. Helens (lamens: mount saint helens) it went from 7:30 am to about 6:00 pm. It was way too long but still kinda thought it was worth it because I thought I had some great pictures, appearantly thats what I get for thinking. Alas, all of the pictures turned out looking exactaly like all the other ones. Lol. I took a picture of a sediment dam, which (if you don't know) is meant to stop future mud flows from getting too close to the neighboring cities; 'Bout an Hour after that I took a picture of the mountian a couple miles up the road... I SWEAR those pictures look like they were just different parts of the same field. I am still a little peeved about that. Well anyhow   Uhggg. so yeah. I am kinda nervous about whether or not I wil be allowed to continue w/ my research. oh well  >>>> I am  writing this message durring class, I hope I don't get in trouble  signing off Sayonora suckers!!! aequinoctialis

      K, i have been inviting people to my blog now, however, I have never made a blog before this one so I really don't know how this will work once they have recieved their invitations I expect they will be able to post but how? will they be given a password to my site or do i have to provide that? Its too much thinking... I am going to stop now...  *crickets chirping* Okay, nevermind. Not thinking was a bad idea...  well I am going to have an ulcer... No joke. I am Freaking out. I need a job, need better grades and I need a dash of sanity... I am going to try ang get my friend to take me out to lunch but he probably wont because he comes to school half way through lunch so we wouldn't be able to get back in time unless I can convince him that missing part of english would be acceptable. AN YOU KNOW WHAT, I DARESAY THAT MISSING PART OF ENGLISH WOULD BE WORTH IT FOR A COUPLE OF HOT PIZZA STICKS!!!! so there. uhgg. I am Soo hungry. I can't do anything this week. I have to go strait home and work..... this sucks, my school gets out later than any other school in the area... over and out.,;'[]/.,'[['

      I am a AP level biology student. and in my ap Bio class my teacher has given me a bogus grade... god I hate that word, 'bogus', is that really a word? anywho... I have a 60.3%, now most people would sure say, "60%, well thats a 'D', at least your not failing" well however optimistic that may be it is totaly wrong... But how it is wrong I do not know. I have been given the letter grade of 'F'. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE??? well at least I have my final exam grade to fall back on... I hope. and if I do well on the AP examintaions then I could get an automatic 'A' in my class. so I am gonna remake some of the work and pray like a friggin monk for the next week...  I am currently being bombarded by a conversation about which hand you should wear your watch on and about how people tie their shoes differently. oh god, this is another conversational low....

      Soon I am going to make another blog for my pathetic obsession. Video Games. Particularly Morrowind (all of the expansions), Halo (I am getting better @ it), and unreal championship and various varieties and sub categories of these same games. so that is meant to lead up to what I have been itching to share. I finaly started and finished the 'blood moon' portion of morrowind: elder scrolls 3 and i got to a point where I had to make a decision right? "you are infected with the dark curse sanies lupines and in three days time the transformation will be complete, you must heal in that time or you can no longer be considered the friend of the Skaal", that was paraphrasing. so I saved there on two different file slots. I healed my self on one and I let the infection take over on the over. thus I am now amoungst the ranks of the terrible and formidable werewolves. AND ITS SO COOL. The first night I just had to kill another human player to sustain 'the beast within for another night' so of course I thought it proper to kill the man who shunned me from the village... and it was sweet! you can run really fast and jump even faster and farther too. the only weapon you have is your bare, however clawed, hands. the problem is tho that even though my health (normaly somewhere around 200 points) was 570 points and my fatigue was 450 points I got hurt quickly by their weapons. which is probably due to the Nordish custom of weilding silver weapons.well after the first night I had to find a place to safely transform back into a human... well, a elf anyhow. Then, having liked my rampaged I opted to wait till the night to try out my next rampage. well I was used to the mini movie that follows transforming but his time it was different. the dark daedra lord hircine spoke to me and gave me missions and for completeing the I gained sharper claws, and the ability to summon a day time hunting partner, a bone wolf. heh heh heh. I had to stop the skaal from retrieving a ritual amulet. then stop a ritual hunt. when you are playing as the good guy you have to go get the amulet and and perform the hunt, so it is very wierd. but as a good guy you get magical amulets that increase your attack and the ability to summon a hunting partner, a regular wolf summoning spell. which is cool. I havent continued on the good side past that but if you continue the werewolf side you get a special ability that will heal 1000 health points. Blood moon is awesome!! you gotta get it and play it. gotta go bye... sleepy... *yawn*

      You would be failing... So it not possible with out the help of some one who actualy knows what they are doing... oh well I tried. Uh back on the subject of what I did all this week while I was away from posting. Hmmm. and back to the subject and being a failure in long term memory. and for that matter, short term memory too. Don't ask me to remember something I  Will  forget it, else I will write it down... then I will loose and/or forget where I wrote it down at. In short I'd loose my own head if it wasn't attached To my shoulders. oh, and speaking of not remembering I just realized that these wierd thoughts I was thinking just now were in fact something I meant to remember. So I'm not completely hopeless. well I remembered that I was going to start Posing some of my research soom in a sister site, so I can access my info anywhere and also post new info so I can go home and down load my not that I was taking while I was out. I felt very intelligent in the way that I actualy thought out a good organizational process. which for me is rare. I can spew biology, physics, chenistry info like a person with food poisoning... Heh, that was mean, and kinda gross (oh well)... But when it comes to anything sensible or usefull I am at an utter loss. If Its Meaningless, Mundane, Unimportant, Boring, or plain stupid I will probably remember it... so I guess that I'm just kinda... useless at remembering... Everything that matters... Hmmm. INTRUIGING! I MUST REMEMBER THAT!!!   So uhmmm I frustrated with my Dad and Bro... Code named uh... Dad and Bro.... So uh  *whispers*  agent Bro has really bad hay fever and... lol Just kidding (for further references just kidding will be shortened to J/K) Yeah tho... my dad has really bad hayfever and he has been putting off taking allergy medicine because he has felt fine up till like 2 weeks ago when his allergies hit him like a right handed upercut to the jaw....*fade to a boxing analogy*  BAM! ... and he is on the couch... 1-2-3... he's not moving...3-4... wait is he?... Nooo he was just wiping tears out of his swelling eyes...5-6-7... all thats left for us to do audience is to watch on and hope he conquers those sniffles...8-9... is he gonna make it?...10!!! And Dad is Out of the match due to a knock-Out!!!  K.O.!!!!!!!!!!  and the contestant hailing from Pretty Pink Pansey fight school takes the victory!!!!! *fade back* yeah. It was like watching a badly paired boxing match where one guy is obviously going to win. In this case mister Pretty Pink Pansey won... BUt really peeves me is not the fact that my dad knew allergy season has hit like a month ago and he just waited around saying i dont need it but its the fact that now that he is finaly feeling the effectf of the allergens he is blaming his newly rediscovered achilles heel on some sort of a flu bug or something like that... "Uhmm" He drawlys had dazedly "well when I was at my cousins hous his baby was kinda sickey so i must have gotten it there" and here is when my biology mode kicks in.   IT TAKES LIKE 3 DAYS FOR A FLU TO DEVELOP IN YOU'RE BODY THEN IT TAKES ANOTHER 3 DAYS TO HAVE BUILD UP AN IMMUNITY AND CEASE BEING CONTAIGOUS AND ANOTHER 12 DAYS TO BE FULLY IMMUNIZED FROM THAT PARTICULAR DISEASE!!!"   and he was there 1... count em... 1 day. 24 friggen hours is not enought time to feel sick... and to be shor my brother is basicaly complaing about the same thing  saying " but i don't have allergys" lets see, Your head is swollen to the size of a seedless watermelon, your eyes water, and you have uncontrolable sniffles that are not being cured with cold medicine... duh... you have allergies... oh well. I know better.. I carry my medicine with me, just in case I need em. Not like those retards... well this post is long enough. bye. AND YOU MUST COME BACK OR A GIANT RAVENOUS SLUG WILL BORE A HOLE IN YOUR SKULL AND SUCK OUT YOUR BRAINS. bye

      I Know what my future has in store for me. Yuppers. I do. Tonight My mom will get home and be all angry and stuff cause I need new dress slacks and she'll be all "can't you just survive one night in em?" and I'll be like "you said that last time they were too small.". Then l8r I am going to actualy go and get them. also I am going to look for a green tie to mach my hair color, cause a bright color on black slacks and a black shirt looks cool. then l8r sum more I am going to try to slink outta my summer concert for orchestra, but sadly... I will fail. then I will go home and sleep, yup. sleep. exciting huh? I know its a far cry from any of my earlier posts. BUT I MUST TELL THE TRUTH!!!!! ahh... if u want a lie just talk to my pet rock, he can tell some tall tales...  :-)   @->--      And children, remember. Paintings don't talk but if they talk to YOU then drilling a hole in your head might help.  PEaCe, or NOT  out

      So um, remember how I said that my hair wouldn't be all 'smurfy' well I was later informed that smurfs are blue... my bad. In my AP biology class we are designing a murder mystery for the lower grade level bio students to solve. -aequinoc rubs his hands together menecingly- You see... I am an expert at this, being that I am a science nerd~ wait a moment... did I say nerd... I meant... uhmm science... uh.. hottie? yeah thats it. You ladies out there reading this be assured that I am not a nerdy not to mention pasty over weight kid who rarely sees the light of day...... so anywho~ being that I am a science 'hottie'. ; ) . I have plenty of practice making up mock murders but appearantly so is my teacher. Mr. Fleckenstein. aka. Mr. fleck. aka. fleck. aka. huggybear   yep acid does burn, AND IT HURTS TOO. so kids remember. unless you are using acid to completely digest the remnants of a week long killing spree, it is not a good idea to play with it.  PEACE OUT HOMMIES

      ahhhh, I had a nice and relaxing weekend. I sat around drank iced tea in the sun... oh wait....  nevermind. IT WAS CLOUDY AND MUGGY ALL WEEKEND. uhgg. It was horrible except for the fact that I got my hair dyed. yuppers. And you, the devoted readers might ask, "what color did you get your hair dyed?" at which point I would be Obliged to answer you with a hearty GREEN!!! Yipeeee. Green just so happens to be my most favorite color. yup, it is cool; and no, its not all "punky" or "rainbow-ish" or anything like that. Geeze I thought you would be more open to the idea. how closed-minded. Fine then, it looks like I'll have to explain to you. I only got my hair highlighted green so it really isn't like a smurf or anything. It is bold but still minimalistic. Punk, but conservative. the happy medium. and my parents didn't kill me so that is like icing on the cake. Yeah. and I am a swEEt cake... lol, J/K. The dye washes out in like 40 washes, so like a month. and I will be normal in no time. *sigh*. lol. who wants to be normal anyhow. besides it is kinda interesting to see some little todler pointing saying "mommy look'it" and then seeing the mom's reaction: "honey don't stare, its not nice." lol. I kinda am enjoying the attention.   But remember kids, staring isn't kind. & may cause semi-psychotic people to loose their grip on reality and kill you. So remember, when u see a freeky guy dont stare, he might kill you, just glance and look away.  I know what I am doing today. TODAY I am finaly going to get that glass of iced tea and relaxing afternoon nap. ahhhh.... but of course now that I said that I have probably jinxed it... oh well... C YA NEXT TIME
