      Thief 3 - Downloading the demo... It's huge, almost 500MB... should be fun... more later...  ... and since I haven't really played any games for the last 4 weeks and been too busy to check out game news...  STEAM NEWS LATEST STEAM NEWS CS:CZ v1.2 Coming Next Week May 27, 2004, 2:17 pm Â· cliffe    Version 1.2 of CS:CZ will be released next week via Steam. The update includes high-definition hostage models with all-new AI, 2 new player models, brand new maps, and other enhancements.

      So, during the first three weeks of class we've covered the beginning history of video games from Spacewar to the video game crash of the early 1980's.  We've seen that after Atari foolishly did not copyright their intellectual property (the games) tons of third party software makers used Atari's games for their own consoles, Intellivision, Colecovision, and ADAM.  The Colecovision had an add-on that allowed users to play Atari 2600 games, ADAM had an expansion pack that allowed the user to play games from the Colecovision, and Atari's 5200 Supersystem wasn't even compatible with the Atari 2600 or VCS games.  So, now it's interesting to see this  urlLink article  pop up.    It looks like Microsoft is testing the waters to see what gamers want out of their next generation consoles.  In all reality this isn't a thought from way out in left field.  The Xbox is basically a scaled down PC that plays console games only.  Personally, there's is no way in hell I would pay $599 for a system like this when I can build my own PC that would blow the specs of the next-gen Xbox out of the water for cheaper.  The only real incentive that I see in buying something like this is that there are tons of games that are only offered on one of the two mediums.  Halo for Xbox is a good example of this, although within the last year Halo was finally released for PC.  And Counter-Strike for PC has only been available for Xbox within the last year.... Vice City is another and i'm sure there are many more...  Theoretically, after spending $600 on this system, I assume that I'd have to shell out a monthly subscription service for Xbox Live as well?  I prefer buying my games once and not continually having to pay just to play.  How about all the console makers just do their console thing and let the PCs do their thing?  It kind of reminds me of the  urlLink Phantom .  But I'll save that for another blog...

      Service Engine Soon lights and missfiring really screw up your schedule....  So I was trying to come up with something for this entry...  scanning the news for some new "finding" which proves that video games are the cancer of the entertainment industry.  Alas... I didn't find anything new.  Oh well, but I did run across  urlLink this .  After some more scanning I found the  urlLink On-line Gamers Anonymous forums (OLGAnon) , it's like an AA group for addicted video game players.  Most of those addicted are Everquest players.  Personally, I've never played EQ or Diablo or any of the MMORPGs...  they just don't appeal to me.  But apparently a lot of people blame these games for everything from losing cars to houses to spouses, etc...    After reading through several posts there are some things posted that I've seen in myself... I guess you could say I was addicted to counter-strike at one time.  I'd go to work and classes just so I could go home and play CS all night.  There were days when I'd play CS from the time I got up until I went to bed...  Don't get me wrong, I've never lost a house or car or anything for that matter to playing video games, but I know there have been MANY times when I put off doing everything in order to play some cs.  But I also don't think being addicted to video games is the correct answer or excuse... I mean come on.  There are things called priorities and a lot of times I think a lot of people get those screwed up completely.  If a person chooses to spend all their playing video games then they choose to neglect everything else... it wasn't the video game that made them do it.  As of now, I haven't played enev played a video game in almost 3 weeks... just don't have the desire right now or the time.  I',m sure that will change, I've just been too busy.

      It's rather amazing, if you think about, how Atari was able to squeeze all the information needed for their VCS/2600 games into their cartridges, which were 4K in size.  In today's technology, 4K would be enough to store a small text file, which is basically what their code equated to.  It's even harder to believe that the VCS/2600 only had 128 bytes of RAM and a 1Mhz processor!  At that time those specs were innovative and pushed technology to the extreme.  Compare the specs of the VCS or Intellivision to that of current video game like Unreal tournament 2004 for example.  UT2K4's minimum requirements are:  Pentium III or AMD Athlon 1.0GHz (1.5 GHz or better highly recommended) - That's 1000x more processing power needed compared to the VCS 128 MB RAM (256 MB or higher highly recommended) - That's like 1,000,000x the RAM required 5.5 GB hard disk space - That's about 5,000,000x the storage the game requires  In the evolution of video games, pushing technology to the max is the norm.  The above example demonmstrates that. And those requirements are just the basics.  A system must have a high-end video card capable of handling the graphics,etc... There's always something faster or more innovative on the horizon and game developers are usually the first to put it to use.  Of course when more resource-hogging games coming out that means players have to continually upgrade their systems to handle the new batch of games (except for consoles, kind of).  Console games are designed to run fine with the console's normal specs, with the addition of buying memory cards.  Console owners only have to worry about "upgrading" their systems when the next generation of consoles come to the market, usually every 3-4 years or so.  But for PC gamers as games get more demanding it can lead to an expensive hobby...   urlLink Here's an article demonstrating this.

      So, one good reason to play video games is because of their ability to take you out of reality and escape for a while... have fun, sort of like a mini vacation filled with adrenaline, right?  What about bars incorporating  urlLink plasma screens and PS2s ?  With the average age of gamers being 29, that could make for a sweet LAN party or tournament, don't ya think?     Personally, I think putting consoles in bars may be too much.  Arcade and pinball games, sure... but maybe that's because I'm getting old.  When I go to a bar, I'm thinking about watching sports on big screens and hangin' with some friends.  I can throw a few back and play some games with friends at home.  When I go out to public places I'm more interested in living in reality, and not virtual reality.  Plus it's safer.

      Anyone who has spent at least a year in college or a year living in the dorms knows what a large roll video games play in a student's everyday life.  When I was a freshman there was either a computer, N64, PS1, or a combination of the three in everyone's room.  Doors were always left open.  Inside, kids crowded around the TV or monitor collecting coins or shooting bad guys.  "I just owned you." "You got so lucky." "I'll get you next time."  Too many unneeded distractions for us young scholars.  In no way am I complaining.  Although I haven't been back in the dorms for several years I'm sure that things haven't changed much, except for newer technology and more options.    Then I find out that IU offers a course based on video games, the social history in fact.  With this being my final semester, I jump all over it.  So far, so good.  But I'm thinking, 'why couldn't they have offered classes like this a few years ago?'  I bet the classes would fill faster than the History of Rock n' Roll classes or the Human Sexuality classes.    I always knew, or assumed, that there were "tech" schools like DigiPen in Redmond, WA that teach nothing but game design, but now it seems that the idea of video games as a college major is spreading.  This  urlLink article  brings it all out.  Apparently more and more universities are incorporating video games into their curriculum.  This qoute from the article explains it nicely, "Games are an important part of culture and are here to stay."

      So I thought I grew up a little closer to the beginning of video games.  I can vivdly remember playing on the  urlLink TI-99/4A  that my parents bought for my brother, sister and I.  It was sometime around 1982 or shortly after.  It hooked right up to the TV and had a slot for cartridges, joystick inputs, and a tape/data (cassette) recorder could be hooked up to it to save/download/upload/run files and programs.  At the time, that seemed pretty damn cool to me.  Of course my parents had some educational games and learning tools for it, but I loved playing Moon Patrol, Tombstone, Parsec, and Nerm of Bemer.  I'd play until my eyes watered.  Sometime around 1986 we got a NES system.  Mario Brothers rocked...     Turns out, I was introduced to video games about 30 years after Higinbotham's oscilloscope game and Russel's Spacewar.  After reading the first few chapters of The Ultimate History of Video Games, by Steven Kent, it's amazing to see how far video games have come, even looking at the TI-99 back in the early 80s.  Pong was fun on the TI, but Parsec and Moon Patrol were far superior in terms of graphics and gameplay.    I don't really remember much hype or controvesy about videogames back in the day, but I was young...  It has certainly changed.

      Since I've never really had time to keep a blog, this is my first attempt.  The reason behind this comes from a college class I'm taking, The Social History of Video Games.  It should definately be fun.  There should be bi-weekly posts to follow. l8z

      This entry will cover several items that have been in the news recently that tie into what we have been discussing in class.   urlLink Nintendo is developing a new console .  This doesn't come as surprise to me  as all the current consoles, PS2, GC, and Xbox are all 2 years old or so.  It's time for the console to be talking about their next generation consoles.  But, according to the article, Nintendo's new console will not just be a next generation console, but an entirely new concept codenamed "Revolution."  Nintendo is not releasing any information about the new and I don't blame them giving the history of how the competition works in the video game industry.  Siting a slump in the industry, Nintendo is tryign to come up with a new way to play games.  It will be interesting to this develop as well as seeing what Sony and Microsoft havei n store for their future consoles as well.    More Nintendo news... urlLink Nintendo going back to their roots   Nintendo is jumping on the bandwagon with the whole idea of retro, 80s, etc and rereleasing some of the most popular gaems from the days of the NES.  They are also releasing a version of the Gameboy Advance that looks like the original Gameboy.  This sounds like a good idea to me.  The games they are planning on releasing are games that never get old.  I think this will be a decent seller for the older gaming crowd who fell in love with the origianl NES games back in the day...   We've spoken alot about movie-to-game and games-to-movie this semester.  It is becoming more and more common.  And will continue this way while technology continues to improve.  Two more movies being made into  urlLink games .  Shrek and Van Helsing games have been released.  This just shows that no matter what the movie, a game can be created from it.  I think it's great as long as the games are fun and resemble the movie.  Although I haven't played much of the Atari's Matrix recently, I was somewhat disappointed with it when it was released.  I believe Atari has released some patches for it.  I'll pick it up again someday...  It will definately be interesting to watch what the industry does in the coming years.  It's exciting to look back and see how far games have come.  With the speed of technological improvements, it is definately exciting to think about what will come next.  I have a feeling games will be EVERYWHERE.  Additional interesting article, although nothing shocking.   urlLink Exrteme PCs aiming for gaming niche

      If anyone would have asked me 10 years ago, "Should there be some sort of regulation on video games?" I would have answer with a "hell no!"  And before actually thinking about the question I would now almost surely say now "hell no," as well.  But when I actually recently thought about the big picture, violence, sex, impressionable children, etc.  I've come to realize that some sort of regulation is needed, atleast to help calm the battle regarding violence and sex exposure in video games and their effects on children.   As much as I hate regulations (I have the "only the strong survive," freedom, and Darwin mentality)that limit what adults choose to do, the way that the ESRB handles their rating system is a step in the right direction.  It doesn't really apply to adults who want to play a certain games, but it does limit those who are under 17 years old to buying games that carry a rating for adults.  This seems like the thing to do since it is how other forms of entertainment handle the situation of sex and violence in their media.  An additional measure to prevent adult rated games from getting into the hands of children would be to hold retailers responsible for what they sell to whom.  Giving retailers the power to refuse sales of adult rated games to children would be a good way of doing it.  And holding retailers responsible for 'illegal' sales with fines and other penalties would be a way of holding retailers to apply the regulation.   As much as I don't like it, the government may have to get involved in order to quiet the debate on the effects of violent games on children.  If it doesn't quiet the debate, maybe atleast it will 'save' the lives of all the impressionable children whom are negatively affected, (when that is proven right or wrong).

      In honor of anxiously awaiting the arrival of LSL: Magna Cum Laude, let's talk about sex in video games.  In my previous blogs I've touched on violence, a little nudity, and parents' responsibility for what their kids do at home...  I'm all for some good violence in games.  What about nudity?  I have no problem with that either.  A  urlLink commentary  published in the Washington Post over the weekend touches on the growing amount of adult eye candy in new/upcoming releases.  It was only a matter of time before Playboy would release interactive media or a video game.  It appears that the time is drawing near.  "Playboy: The Mansion" is set to hit the shelves before summer's end leaving the author of the commentary pondering how many kids will be exposed to this evil pit of scum that is nudity in video games.  I like this quote from the article:   "We've been working really closely with the ESRB from day one," says the marketing director at Cyberlore, makers of the Playboy game. "Everyone knows what the limits are for violence because everyone has pushed that envelope. But no one knows where the limits are for sex and nudity."   Â Â Â Â Doesn't that sum up the manufacturer mentality perfectly? We don't know where the limits are, and we won't assume any responsibility for locating them. We're going as far off the deep end as they'll let us. Right and wrong are irrelevant.  It seems like the author is placing all of the blame on developers.  This is wrong.  Freedoms in the U.S. cover a wide spectrum.  People can choose to do what they want to do and parents can choose how they want to handle the situation with their kids.  Being a parent doesn't mean that when one's child is not under their direct supervision it is someone else's responsibility to tell a child what they can and cannot do.  There is only so much that can be done.  The ESRB rates games, M ratings are for 17+.  Having laws/ordinances for proof of ID when purchasing an M rated game at retailers is one way to regulate sales of M games to minors.  And that is as far as the regulation should go.  Compare the most sexually explicit video game to some hardcore porn.  The similarities a uncanny! (/sarcasm)  It seems that there are people out there who seem to think sexually explicit video games are worse than hardcore porn and need heavier restrictions than hardcore porn as well.  Christ people.... wake up, be a parent, do your job and let others do theirs.

      In an  urlLink article  published today by CNN Money's Chris Morris he writes about the impact gamers have on the future of games to be released.    I wouldn't call myself a hardcore gamer, although there was a time not too long ago that I'd spend 10 hours a day playing Counter-Strike; that has recently changed.  I think I have logged about an hour of play time in the last month.  And even when I was playing CS nonstop I still wouldn't call myself a hardcore gamer, but rather a hardcore CS player.  I have GTA3:VC, The Matrix, Call of Duty, UT2K4, Halo, and a few other PC games that I haven't even really played because I was always too busy playing CS... I'll get to those games sometime.  Anyways, according to the article above, hardcore gamers are the ones with the greatest impact on games.  They're the ones who get the buzz going and they're the ones who are most critical of games.  In respect to those 2 facts, they help out developers greatly.    I've witnessed both the buzz and the criticalness first hand.  I bought GTA3:VC for PC the day it was released because of all the great things I heard about it from PS2 players.  I played Doom and Wolfenstien 3D back in the day because they were ground-breaking and the buzz that was going around about them, they lived up to it.  We've touched on the early beginnings of MMORPGs in class, but they're not really my cup of tea.  Now, Half-Life 2 on the other hand, is a different story.  There is such a huge following for Valve's newest upcoming release, and the angst, joy, and critiques of hardcore fans that Morris writes about in his column provides a perfect example.  I along with hundreds of thousands of PC gamers are anxiously awaiting it's release this year.    Another thing we are going to be discussing in the coming week in class is violence in video games.  Like I've said in my previous posts, I have no problem with the blood and gore and gratuitous sex.  There are more and more games being released with M ratings.  Many publishers/developers are changing their ways and targeting this hardcore gaming audience.  For example, EA and THQ, who have not released many games with an M rating are planning on releasing several in the near future.  They have heard what the hardcore gamers want... and it looks like that's what the hardcore gamers will get!

      Death Race 2000 was deemed the first controversial violent video game back in the early days of video games.  The arcade cabinet featured gruesome artwork and the object of the game was to run over people, or zombies depending on who you talked to.  There are two articles that influenced this blog.  One about  urlLink video game ratings  and the other about Rockstar Games' new game on the PC market,  urlLink Manhunt .  First off, the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) is in control of handing every video game a rating.  The games of concern are the games that receive an M for mature rating.  That means that these games are not to be sold to anyone under 17.  This is all fine and dandy and I think video games should have ratings just as movies have ratings.  An 18 year old has the right to vote for their president, they should have the right to play whatever video game they want.  What I don't think is fine and dandy is the government trying to control the content of video games.  Do we see any governmental control of content in motion pictures?  No.  I enjoy playing Counter-Strike and Vice City.  Both games contain a lot of blood and violence, but does it make me want to go out on a violent crime spree?  Not at all.  When I'm playing a game, I want it to be realistic.  And things portrayed in video games do happen in the real world.  There are plenty of murders and other violent crimes that happen every day and then coverage is shown on the news daily.  Does that make people want to go out and commit those same acts?  Not necessarily.  In the end, it is and always has been the responsibility of the parents to monitor what their kids are buying and playing in their house.  This is a "free" country and we should have the opportunity to expose ourselves to whatever we want.  The government is getting bigger and bigger all the time and trying to regulate everything they deem has a negative impact on the citizens of this country.  It's time for the government to worry running the country instead of being a big brother and monitoring what the people value as art and entertainment.
