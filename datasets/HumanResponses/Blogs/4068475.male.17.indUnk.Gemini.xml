      Okay. Didn't do much today. Stayed home, played some WC3.   And god, I should stop playing that on Battle.net, actually, just the custom games. People are morons. It's like walking into the cesspool of idiocy. Seriously, if you ever get the chance to check it out, I don't know whether to advise you to stay away, or to at to prove I'm not bullshitting you. That place is awful.  Games are bad too, tower defenses, defense of the ancients, I mean, some games aren't bad, but try some variety, ya? It gets boring playing the same thing over and over with the handfull of idiots who spout shit like, "yo lik wtfl ol god dude noob"

       urlLink    Picture of my taru character from Final Fantasy XI. I used to use this to kick it with my friend, Christian in-game. But now I just use it to play on whenever I'm extremely bored. Which doesn't happen often now. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink     It's Lil' John.. or is it?&nbsp; urlLink      It's a picture I edited, of Animal from the muppets, what more do you want?   Oh, why I did it? It's hillarious. Plus I think Lil' John is animal. Look at that picture, then try arguing with me. Yeah, that's right.    YOU CAN'T  .  Can't argue with facts my friend.

       urlLink    Alright. This is another recent comic that I made. I guess you won't get much unless I do the "commentary."&nbsp; urlLink     Okay. The story behind this is that there was this one idiot on Battle.net. What a surprise, right? Yeah, right. Anyways. This guy, goes on and on about how he hates niggers, and how he's going to burn us, even though me and my friend aren't black. Then this idiot keeps rambling about how he makes 70 thousand a year, and he's 20 years old.  Frankly? I think this guy must be 12, I hope. Or else this leaves little hope for planet Earth if morons like these will inhabit it. Jesus. Just imagine this guy making 70 thousand dollars a year, talking about that stupid shit.  I barely noticed I didn't actually describe what's going on with the comics.     Well  ... I been watching the Surreal Life recently, that's been on Vh1 and has all these old school celebrities and stuff. Mix that in with the above story, and you got yourself a stupid story. There.

      Aggh... I accidentally deleted this post, and now I have to rewrite it. So let me rewrite it.  Me and my friend Hunter, had this sprite comic thing going on last summer, and we made some funny comics and all, but then we stopped. Recently though... it has started up again! That's right. So check it out, and I'll post whatever we come up with, whether it's stupid, stupid-funny, not-stupid-funny, or just plain not funny.  If you're here, you might as well read the crap I got to say? Right? No. . . Then. . . :(

       urlLink    I hope this works. Using a new blog.&nbsp; urlLink     Alright. This comic is about my favorite movie (Pulp Fiction), and my friend (Not favorite). jk jk  Anyways, yeah. It's an "homage," "parody," whatever you want to call it, about one of the scenes in the movies. I thought it was funny. It's stupid, but yeah. Funny?

      Alright, first post. Not really, I just recreated from the old one, because well, the title didn't really fit. Anyways...  I'll be moving the stuff over, and my friend will also add stuff, and post stuff, whatever.

      No one reads this shit, but if someone did, Luis got mouth surgery or some shit and probably won't make a comic for a while.  I made the last comic, so until he's made another, I've reached my quota, bitches.
