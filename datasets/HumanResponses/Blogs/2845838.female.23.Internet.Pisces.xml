       (HU)WHAAAATTTTTT????!!!!!!!  New account again.  Which is Good.  Nothing much really.  Back to training again.   Every morning before 7 am. Have to rush to our office, almost running. When I arrive, right after the entrance~  I would: Pause, turn around, face this computer. Type in my ID number, read "Login".  Type in my password.  Tap, tap, tap my foot. Wait for the system to register.  As if I'm in a REAL hurry.  Pretending to be late.  Then I would: Pause, turn around, head to the CR. As if almost running again.  My hair flapping behind me.  Look around for somebody I know.  Smile, smile, and yes, another smile. As if I'm in a REAL hurry.  Pretending to be late.  Then I would: Pause, turn around, face the mirror. Comb my hair.  Dub on some lip gloss.  As if I'm in a REAL hurry.  Pretending to be late.  Then for the last time, I would: Pause, turn around, head back to the lobby. Pretending to be late, I'm honestly truly really not. I just walk fast as if I'm always in a rush. Because I just love pretending to be late.

      Main Entry:  insomnia  Function: noun Etymology: Latin, from insomnis sleepless, from in- + somnus sleep -- more at SOMNOLENT : prolonged and usually abnormal inability to obtain adequate sleep  Yes, I don't know why. For the last few days it's so hard for me to get some sleep. I'm just super tired. I guess. I have been drained~ Emotionally. Intellectually. Physically. Socially. Spiritually.  This morning I went to take up EPT. The English Proficiency Test. It went out well. I hope. Then had a little chitchat with a not-so-close officemate. Nothing much really. Let's just say~ Damn. I can't keep my mouth shut. I was able to share things to him things that I shouldn't have.  Yeah. Stupid me. Really. When will I ever learn. Not to just trust anybody. Unless I got to KNOW them. I can't keep doing that you know? I just can't. That's my weakness. I easily trust people.  Oh well. I hope he's somebody that can be trusted. Let's just cross our fingers. Cross our toes. Do the yoga. Haha. Call a shrink.  Anyway~ Tonight, they will be having a night out at Camp Zitro. In celebration of? Our last day of work today? The End Of Life? Super super sad. I don't feel like going. Really. So I'd rather watch some movie. With Kristine. I don't care if it's just "Milan". Hehe~ I'll sleep. For all I care. Let me just do that. Or watch a horror movie. Scare the hellshit out of me. Yeah. For all I care. Let me just do that too.  ~That's all for now.

      Yesterday I was so depressed and so so down. I had my third interview with the company's client the other day. And I was so so stupid because I asked a senseless question and I was like- blabbing and blabbing around... No thought at all! Some of us received their Job Orders from the company. And I don't have mine yet. Which is why I feel so discouraged. Maybe I don't deserve to be here. I'm not worthy- somebody just helped me that's why I got in... you know, all those self-defeating thoughts, the paraphernalias of anti-self... bad, bad BAD. And so my day was sooo dull, super dull, plus I was turned down by another company later that day telling me- right on my face- that the result came out negative, which means- I didn't pass the exam. They really didn't check it. For sure. It was too quick. Unfair. Maybe because my present company is their competitor. They asked me where tahell i came from before they slapped me. *Sigh* Oh well. Wutevah. And so there was I, really really weak. Drained. Discouraged. Depressed... When I arrived at work... my friends greeted me like they hadn't seen me for a vewy long time... They were trying to get in touch with me that morning... damn my cel was broken... so they said I have another interview. I thought I failed. Well, good. For me. Then I received a recommedation email from the HR by our Account Manager. Wow. It made up my day!  ~So now, I'm up and alive again... which is why- I need a shrink, shrink, SHRINK... haha.

       I need a SHRINK! :(   Now, I'm confused. I don't know where to write. In my Blogger? Or in my OpenDiary? My OpenDiary account is sort of... too revealing because I made mentions there of several people. Those I hate, I like, I love, I'm angry at... you name it... I probably have it. You can sense my feelings there. Some mushy, corny stuffs. Ugh. You can't blame me. I'm an emotional being! So to make it short, it's never safe to publicize it to just anyone. You'll probably realize that I do change a lot... in terms of my my emotional wavelength... what I like right now, what I like 4 hours from now... I call that - dynamicism. Or is it? Whatever...  So anyway, right now I'm so angry, so pissed off, so annoyed! Grrr...  I hate hearing her voice.  (I learned something from rhye - he said "If they hate you , it only means they really wanted be like you.")  Yes, I hate her but it doesn't mean I wanted to be like her. NEVER. She's a biatch. She is hurting me and she doesn't know that. And I hate her because of that. Her voice annoys me.  Argh!  ~Oh well. That's just it. I'm not the type who gives out scandals... I know I'm not that bad. I'll learn to like her. So I keep on praying and praying... God, let me like her. To accept reality. To realize that everything won't come out the way I wanted it to be. I just have to deal with that. To LIVE with that. To get hurt. Because SHIT happens. That's why I need an outlet. I need to get this out. It just seems I can't find that comfort. Nobody wants to take that burden, or is it? I don't think it's 'that' hard... :( I just wanted to have a friend. That's all. No more. No less. Let me talk... Listen to me... at least for once... Be my shrink... :)  ~I got to pee. ~Bye for now.

       Lessons I've Re-Learned   "One can simply never know how the tides turn or what the future may hold. A strong positive impression is a great personal investment in everyone’s future".  "Please remember that sometimes although we give our best, we don't get the prize we thought we would. This scenario happens in life a lot, but we do learn valuable lessons from the experience and we are usually better people for having gone through it".   "Sometimes we lose the battles we are currently fighting, the end result isn't what we expect. But, HOW we lose the battles is often more important than winning the battle anyway".   "I've been interviewed for a lot of positions in various companies. I don't always get the positions. But I have learned that if I handle the situation with grace and continue to do the best job that I know how, I am often rewarded with praise down the line. So many people, when they get news that disheartens them, simply gives up. YOU CANNOT DO THIS. People are watching you to see how you take the news. Your reaction to news such as this often paves the path for your future. Fight by continuing to do your best".  "Your own future is in each of your own hands. Often it is not what happens that effects us the most but it is our reaction to it that matters most".   "I am not giving up. I am not going to give less. I am still here at 100%, please be with me".

      My mushy side:   Have You Ever? - S Club 7   Sometimes. It's wrong to walk away. Though you think it's over. Knowing there's. So much more to say. Suddenly the moment's gone. And all your dreams. Are upside down. And you just. Want to change the way. The world goes round. Tell me. Have you ever loved. And lost somebody. Wished there was a chance. To say I'm sorry. Can't you see. That's the way. I feel about you and me. Have you ever. Felt your heart. Was breaking? Looking down the road. You should be taking. I should know. 'Cause I loved and. Lost the day. I let you go.   Can't help but think. That this is wrong. We should be together. Back in your arms. Where I belong. Now I finally realise. It was forever. That I found. I'd give it all to. Change the way. The world goes round.   Tell me. Have you ever loved. And lost somebody. Wished there was. A chance to say. I'm sorry. Can't you see.That's the way. I feel about. You and me, baby. Have you ever. Felt your heart. Was breaking? Looking down the road. You should be taking. I should know. (I should know).  'Cause I loved and. Lost the day. I let you go  I really want to. Hear you say. That you know. Just how it feels. To have it all and. Let it slip away. Can't you see. I know the moment's gone. I'm still holding on somehow. Wishing I could. Change the way. The world goes round  Tell me. Have you ever loved. And lost somebody. Wished there was. A chance to say. I'm sorry. Can't you see. (Oh). That's the way. I feel about. You and me, baby. Have you ever. Felt your heart. Was breaking? Looking down the road. You should be taking. I should know. (I should know). 'Cause I loved and. Lost the day I let. Yes I loved and. Lost the day I let. Yes I loved and. Lost the day. I let you go

       You gotta read my favorite Open Diary author:    urlLink The Wasteland of a mind   His name is Joel, I have read everything about his life yet he doesn't know me at all. I know his thoughts. I know his pains. I know his grief. Happiness... I know the girls of his life... almost everything... He's just so REAL. I can see through his soul. What AMAZES me is that I know this guy, yet I haven't met him. He's got a very nice/real/simple life story... just read on, you'll found out about it. Check his favorite authors too... I say, "magnifico!"~ They're also one of a kind. :) Ciao!  PS. Happy Love/Hearts Day! Time Check: 14 February 2004, 1:21 AM

       T'isis punnnn!  Personality Test taken at:  urlLink http://users.rcn.com/zang.interport/personality.html   My Result:  Introspective  Sensitive  Reflective   You come to grips more frequently and thoroughly with yourself and your environment than do most people. You detest superficiality; you'd rather be alone than have to suffer through small talk. But your relationships with your friends are very strong, which gives you the inner tranquility and harmony that you require. You do not mind being alone for extended periods of time; you rarely become bored.

      I have to remove my webpage. In remembrance of Asylum - my webpage. Which somehow provided me strength, in some way. Thank you for being there.  Here are the remnants:   ... Aku scrapbuk: ...  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- December 06, 2003 I'm here at work... :) As usual, I started with a great, wonderful day! And I hope it will end up that way too. Anyway, I've been thinking about the question I asked my brother last night - How are you going to tell someone you don't like them? (It's necessary because he's asking you out and you just don't have the heart to tell them... ugh. yeah... it sux!) - I don't understand why it works that way, I guess it's life's perfection. I have said it before, and I will say it again, life's perfection is the imperfection of life... It's no longer "life" if everything is perfect (no pains, tears)... know what I'm sayin'? *J-Lo's song is played on the background... Like it~!* SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- December 03, 2003 I'm back- again- to reality. It's nice being home for three days (at the same time- sad)... I have to face the real "me" again, and it's quite hard knowing that I can't keep denying truth. *Sigh* Yes, he's still "there". It still hurt knowing that I can't do anything to make "us" work. To think, there are still so many obtacles that he'd have to go through... We can't tell time. We can't keep our feelings constant. We are changing, and we don't know what's in store for us. This is life. I get hurt too. He could get hurt too. I tell you, the worst thing would be knowing that YOU are the reason of that pain...:( For NOW, I know he's (again) still "there" but I don't know if he'll still be 365 days from now... Know what I'm sayin'? And it's NOT AT ALL GOOD for me 'cause I, Sashi, was the cause of "our" pain...*Sigh* Then (let's skip to the part when I was on the ship)- Met a new guy. Typical guy. Asks me out to the ship-bar. Couple of drinks. Chitchat. I got to know him. He got my number. He's just too good to be true. But nah! Guys! I don't mean to generalize- but there are really few decent guys around... Though- at a certain instant. I do hope that this guy is one of them...:) SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- November 20, 2003 Here on my desk, done with my work, nothing to do but wait, wait and wait... *sigh*. Well, I Can say that this is the best time for me to "talk" and be true (yay!). So what's in my mind right now? No biggie really. I just have to make a decision today which I think is pretty hard for me to do... It's sort of a let-go of something I cherish... and it could become my biggest regret... BUT, BUT, BUT! as far as I'm concerned, I still think it's the best decision - let's just say there's a Sashi in me that says, "Hmph! who cares?! My golly! I still have a life to live... and I have no intention of wasting it with regrets! Just not me, nuh-uh! I don't think so!" --So to sum it all up... maybe I'm weak, but I know how to live life the WAY I WANT TO LIVE IT. :) T'at's all! Bow. SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- November 19, 2003 What's in November? Why is November sooo striking? November 6, 16, 19... I agree, November 6 somehow, in someway, is special to me... but 16? 11? 12? 19? Birthdays? I don't know?! It just seems to me that in November - I SHOULD REMEMBER something special that happened to me before... *sigh*... I just forgot what! Anyway, here I am again, talking alone... on the four corners of my asylum, dead-tired but still hangin' there! Just to buy time, making the most of everything :) HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY! Despite, the not-so-nice, ugly things that passed me by - I STILL have a reason to THANK GOD for everything! -because everything that comes is molding me into a person that I am now and most definitely preparing me of something that I might be hurdling in the near future... I LOVE YOU LORD JESUS! Without YOU I am NOTHING! SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- November 14, 2003 Another day... tired from work, but it seems like I'm not AT ALL tired, though I am sleepy... Bed's been calling me time and time again... -later, later, later! Oh well! Being sleepy aside, I CANNOT believe what I wrote last time. Ugh. Reading what I wrote with me at the tip of emotional extremeness (-sometimes I use words I don't understand -pfft! wattapity!) can be very very... er, risky? (Switching mode: emotionality?) Staring blankly at the screen, I am completely aware of every breath I take, breathing in and out, in and out... I can feel the air touching my ear, caressing my nape... In a quick flash of instance, I'm taken back to a time where everything I see seemed colorless, yet clear... Old, yet fresh - fresh as a blood dripping on a new slashed skin... I am taken back to - another quick flash of second - THIS SEAT, where I am sitting lazily typing words without a tinge of "thought"... Mao ra ning writing na wala kai makuha na lesson... Basta, I got knocked down laughing my ass out when I had a typo error - "Okay lang so fart!". Pffft! I realized it now - kagamay ra nakog kalipay... *SIGH* SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- November 12, 2003 BIG PROBLEM... I don't think it's nice to run away from it... But you know, I really don't have a choice specially if you'll be stepped on and everything seems to be - just not fair... So to cut it in half... I'm running away from it. =) No biggie - I hope! Anyway, here I am now. Online. With nothing to do but blah blah blah... So what's in my mind right now? Honestly? Well, it just occurred to me that, somehow, everything that happened in my life has a purpose... and that I can never get what I always wanted. God knows what I want but he knows what's BEST. And I don't know that. Sometimes, we have to make mistakes to realize the right things and when we do, we grow, we learn, and that's the beauty there is in life... high degree of ACCEPTANCE and lesser for EXPECTATIONS - or even none at all... I don't understand why some people "SEES" you with who you are, yet some don't. And those that don't are those people you wish they would do... Does that make sense? I hope so... Aw. Shucks. That's me, my mellow side. SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- November 7, 2003 My POINT is, I don't have a point. Ugh. I'm hungry. SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- November 7, 2003 Today is a wonderful day! =) I am HAPPY because (I'm on the brink of insanity - teehee!) I learned a lot of things lately... I learned that I can be strong when I thought I couldn't be, that no people can EVER COMPARE to my family, they are basically just - er - NOTHING? And THAT, (No I'm not mad!) - just 1 meter radial distance of this somebody here - ssshhh - smells REALLY BAD! That's why I have to leave! Now, now, NOW!  SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- October 31, 2003 I wonder how my X is doing right now... hmmm... Can I just do my blah-blahs here? (asylum: No!) Oh shut up! I don't talk much about my love life except with Joey (hi Joanah! Missing you my friend!) There's this guy A (I call him imma, as in immature!) here, sometimes he's really annoying cuz- well, basically? I don't like him, cuz possessive kaau... and then there's another friend B (I call him 'sister!') here, he's good to be with, but I really really really can't see the "us" with him... and another friend C (I call him "low visibility guy") here, been a friend for soooooo loooooong, and I'd rather keep it that way... then guy D, he's just too good to be true (I call him... er...???), then last friend E (i call him "feeling close mi!"), assuming enday! (asylum: Ho-hum!) Sleepy momoy na pud si Sashi! *yawn* *yawn* Buh-bye! -> Samok Myk (cgeg Ctrl-G)! Dunggabon taka ron! --> That's me talking, being psychopath! SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- October 31, 2003 Hello again! My no-reader-asylum! It's quite some time now... I'm glad I'm back again, babbling and babbling... about me, myself, i and Sashi... Everything's really really really crazy lately! Ugh. The agony of... of... of... whatchacallthat? - I really don't know what term to use! Let me just picture it out for you in colored 3D Multimedia mambo-jumbo (with Dolby Digital Sounds) - Ever wonder what it's like to pass by -let's say PIZZA HUT, and you really really really really like to have one juicy bite on their pizza specialty, and you can't just do that because... your pocket's EMPTY?! - THAT! That's the AGONY I'm talking about! Or is it? Well- kind of, somewhat, in some minute way, a little? Ugh! Look at me yada-yadaying nonsense just because... shit happens yeknaw?! Do you think I should bite off my toe now? How about point a gun on my head?! Bear with me! These are the ramblings of a deranged woman experiencing the chills of HOLLOWEEN. Ugh! Hopeless... SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 23, 2003 SOME PEOPLE just don't understand!!! Grrrr... All they do is take OTHER people forgranted... and that's exactly how i feel right now! I mean... I'm not even asking for more... they don't have to say ANNOYING things if i ask questions - GOOD QUESTIONS at THAT... and i expect at least a decent reply... yeknaw?! cuz things like that pisses me off!!! They can just say NO if they want to... rather than prolong text messages... wasting my load... I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT! Grrrr... Sigh. Oh well... That's it... I'm just mad... (My ears are smokin'!)... SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 21, 2003 Big big sigh... I just saw a P15/hr sign outside this cafe... and i forgot I WAS HUNGRY... so here i am, again, online... missing my family REAL BAD, when I was in Cagayan, right after church... it would then be EAT-OUT time wit' 'em!!! Big big sigh! Yesterday, I went to SM... alone. Hoping i could buy me new shoes... TOO BAD, dili ko fashion conscious-sakto akong spelling? (I'm used to my Mama do the pili2x thingie)... so mao to, wa koi napalit, gutom pa jud, plus galagot ko cuz i felt so helpless NOT EVEN KNOWING HOW TO CHOOSE MY OWN DAMN SHOES!!! Grrrrr... So i went to Greenwich na lang, ate my supper, alone... Went online sa Raintree Mall... sent SMS to friends online... then nanawag akong little bro Madsky (pakpakpak!)... he made me feel better (thanks Mads- gimme 5! pak!) And oh, guess what?!!! Naka night out na jud koooo! Honest! First time ever (with Hegi!) ni KANTA PA JUD KO! sa Karaoke!!! Honest! Sing kog "Friend of Mine" by Lea Salonga... ok... what else... la na... got to go na... Thank God for my asylum! SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 15, 2003 Heylow! I'm in Cloud 7 right now, cuz I WAS (Underlined/Highlighted/in BOLD FONT) -- WASSSS in Cloud 9!!! Hehehe... and YOU, you, YOU, you READING, you beside me, yesss YOU... don't know the reazzzzn why... and I ain't gonna tell you... Nuh-uh. No way!

Na miss lang siguro nako akong family... specially Phrbs (my big bro), nagsend lagi ug email pero "Subject : Pangit ka..hehe". Pffft!.. Muguapa lang ko di taka pansinon... hmph! SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 12, 2003 Very Proud of Mama's Mail... I hope you could all learn from the things she's telling me... Read on... "helo Sash, got your mail and am happy with your thoughts, abi nako discourage na sab ka. You know what? that is what I worry most when you get down, kay we worry. Nevermind, if Papa can't e-mail to you anyway, I always share to him what you are writing to me. How are you Anak, I hope everytime you feel so down, there is always one being who is always there to support you aside from us, and HE is the SUPREME BEING OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. Lahi man jud na SIYA Sash, kay HE understands our needs, and He is always there when you need HIM MOST. JUST FEEL HIS PRESENCE WITHIN YOU AND YOU WILL FEEL SECURE, NO MATTER WHAT TRIALS YOU MAY ENCOUNTER. Usahay, we ask HIM something di niya ihatag dayon, HE has reasons, hulat lang ta and the beauty there is, is the realization later on nga 'ay kaya pala'... because... it will always be for our own favor. You will realize it. Seek first God's kingdom and everything else will fall in place for you. I do have trust that you are in the right track, but sometimes, you are so impulsive, you want to get out, i think you have to work on your patience, sa akong tan-aw God is preparing you for greater tasks ahead, kay tsada man jud imong experiences, it will really hone you in becoming a better, disciplined and humble person. Just take all the lessons, ikaw ra man japon and beneficiary niana, way lain. I can just remember my own experiences before when I was trying to build myself a future, I encountered all sorts of pagsulay, but i tried to face them all and with God's help it made me a better person, or am i? Ay, ad2 nako Sash, naa na Papa, regards ta lang ka. Bye, I love you".  SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 9, 2003 Here again, in the four corners of my asylum. sniff. sniff. (Just read my mama's email) To mama, it's not my pride that makes me want to stay here (in Cebu) rather than in Cagayan... I can't explain it... but in here, though i'm alone... there's satisfaction of taking care of myself and being independent... I miss you Papa,Mama and Ryan and I love you... and i'm always thinking of you and dreaming of being there with you everyday, specially EVERY SUNDAY... I just came from work... and i'm unwinding here... now i have to park... l8r allig8r! muwaaaaaaaaahhhh!!! SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 8, 2003 Happy Birthday Mama Mary!!! I can't believe i was able to compose something that goes like this: "I realized that it's much easier to expose feelings without meaning it to anybody you don't really care about, than showing REAL ones to someone you really care for, to someone special, to someone close, but not too close... YOU". Naks... mushy mushy mushy. Just came from work... vewy vewy tired... just unwinding online... chatting with madsky... as usual... hi lil bro! much love! peace out! SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 6, 2003 Wow. For almost a year... and then now... haven't been here for a long time... waz frustrated over my asylum version 2, cuz i can't find any site that hosts free php webspace... grrrr... so anyway, right now, i'm in MIX Ramos... im using the Php20/hr internet here... chatting with madzky... nothing much happened really... quick updates: had a break up. laughed. laughed. laughed. cried (ssh!). new life. new job. new friends. new people around me... still alive and kickin'... 9 more months to go... i'll be single for ONE whole year!!!! hell yeah!!! celebrate good times, come on!!! Austin: "Yeah baby!" SASHI --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  November 13, 2002 I'm back. But I am not as happy as I used to be... In fact, I am sad... I'm sad because I lost a special person... and right now, I just think I should let things out a little bit... I mean, what's the use of this? I made this an asylum because this would serve as a place where I could be MYSELF. you know? And I have to struggle in my day to day life... I have my GOD, I have a good job, I have wonderful parents, and my brother is the best brother... and I have really good friends... and I am so blessed to have them all... but somehow, I feel a certain sadness... without him... And i have questions only time can answer. Will I ever find another special person who could make me special in sooo many ways like he does? Then another question, then another question... sigh... I don't know... Lighten me up... bblangz@yahoo.com... Well, I have to get going... I still have a lot of things to do... God bless you all! SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 25, 2002 I'm chatting with ronak_love_love right now... i hope he's reading this... he's a very good friend of mine and he taught me a lot of things specially the hidden icons in yahoo! Just want to say regards to him and to all the people in his place. Big hug and big muwah!!! SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 25, 2002 Right now, I am penniless, during lunch time, I ate with Wilma on a nearby eatery and thanks to her she she agreed that she'd pay for it... but I'm still gonna pay her later this evening, actually, I'll let Joel pay for that! Hehehehe! Then I'll pay him when I get home... So thank you Wilma for having a big heart! I'm so glad I have you to count on, not only during financial instabilities but also as a company. God bless you always! Big hug. Big muwaaah! SASHI -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 23, 2002 Joanah, Thanks for taking time to sign my guestbook...

      I got this test from mungkey's blogspot. Taken at:  urlLink http://www.mindmedia.com/brainworks/first-paragraph.jsp    Your Brain Usage Profile   Auditory : 60% Visual : 40% Left : 87% Right : 12%  Sashi, your results indicate a strong left-hemisphere dominance with a mild preference for auditory processing. This blend would suggest that you are an extremely efficient person, logical perhaps to an extreme. You tend to structure your life and learning in very precise ways.   You benefit from experience, seek the rational in situations and feel most comfortable with routine.   You are a detail person. You see each piece of a puzzle or situation with equal clarity and value, and thrive on your ability to fit each piece into a unifying structure.   Your learning style tends toward the auditory, which suggests that you process inputs sequentially and classify each before moving on to the next. You do, however, possess sufficient visualization skills and interest to supplement the auditory tendency and render you more active than a person who is purely auditory.   In all likelihood you will be somewhat reserved in appreciating your own talents and understate your abilities even to yourself. You will organize your time and set schedules for yourself and, in that sense, lose sight of spontaneity and other needs - both of yourself and others. Your enviable organization, structure, and efficiency make you a valuable asset to a team effort.

       Fresh from my two days off.  Teehee! :) So here's my story:  Day 1 (Monday): Slept whole day. I woke up around 6pm. Went online. Gave surveys to my officemates. Pat. Pat. Pat. Cuz I'm good. (I forgot if I ate dinner). Challenged my bro to play some billiards wit' me. Played at Kiosk. He won. I lose. Heck. He taught me some techniques. And I'm one happy sister. Went back BH. Exhausted. Ate 4 slices of bread with Cheez Whiz. Slept.  Day 2 (Tuesday): Slept whole day. I woke up around 6pm. Ate dinner wit' my bro. Went online. Posted on my OpenDiary. Chatted wit' some officemates. Damn I can't give 'em surveys. Ugh. I'm bad. Went back BH. Read Erich Segal's book. Until 6am? And I'm one happy employee. Enjoying the 2 days off. :)  The end.

      people tend to see the things i lack. they said i lack someone who's this and that, who can make me this and that, who can help me this and that... and the list goes on... and they want to be that person in my life who can fill out that space. no. actually, they "pretend" to be that someone. they "assume" they can fill out what they said i lack. they want to be that person in my life. and shit. I DON'T LIKE THAT. don't define me because you don't know me. at all. sure i lack some things in my life but that's something i SHOULD know and NOT you.  i don't know anybody. i don't know him nor her. nobody. yes i know my papa, my mama, my brother but that would only measure a fraction of the "real" them... put this in your mind... I DON'T KNOW YOU AT ALL. Say that again and again and again. Say that in your mind when you sleep, when you eat, when you write, when you drink, when you sit... run it through your brain until it's part of you and in your freaking blood. because you can say a lot of things now. by all means, say it. then take a hike.  there are also people who think too much of themselves that they don't even realize it... they're just sooo close-minded that when you say good things about them, they don't even know how to say thank you. when you say you appreciate what they've done, they throw it back on your face. because they're such miserable, miserable people. they don't care at all. because they don't give a damn. because doing that makes them feel good. that makes them feel better. that makes them look happy and completely miserable inside. pathetic.   why would it be so hard to say "i accept you for who you are". she's so OA, i can see she's that way so i accept her. she's too noisy, but she's like that so i don't mind. she spends too much time in the CR but that's what she really loves and i don't care. be flexible. be accepting. be open. be positive-minded. everybody is unique. you are unique. AND I KNOW YOU ARE UNIQUE. you have a distinct you that i do or do not know. you are your perfect you and I KNOW THAT. what scares you if you give something out of yourself? bear in mind that no people are alike. if you've been hurt, if you've been rejected, if you've been pressed down between two thumbnails by whoever wacko did that to you... you can't go on thinking that it's the only thing people will and can do to you... you're wrong. people have intentions. you can't always assume you know that. it would be a loss of your "great you" if you think that way.  i'm human. i make mistakes. i'm imperfect. but you can't put me or pull me down on that basis. you just can't. i know that the perfection of my life is my imperfection. i have said it, and i will say it again and again if i need to. if i have to. if i say i don't judge people, i don't. but sometimes i do. if i say this thing today, that could change tomorrow, because i sometimes say based on what i feel, other times based on what i think of... i'm never constant. i change a lot. if i say i don't like that, sometimes, i really do, because damn. i can never be perfect. and that's okay. that's my imperfection. that's you. that's me. that's all of us. and you got to admit that.  it takes effort to know somebody. knowing somebody doesn't mean you want something out from that. you can never assume. if i like somebody, i tell them. it's a risk. and it scares me. my intentions? comfort. new friends. more friends. ears who could listen because they don't have a choice, professional shrink wannabees... and honestly? because i feel miserable sometimes and i need somebody to brighten up my day. no more no less. although sometimes a little more and sometimes a little less.  i'm sorry i said things i should or shouldn't have. i guess i have my own reasons why.  i respect your opinion Uther-Pendragon, and i do hope you're reading this. Peace out! BTW, I****ne likes you. so go for it. Haha. Buking. :)   A Little About Me.  Mar 01 to Mar 10  --  Weeping Willow Tree Weeping Willow (the Melancholy)   likes to be stress free, loves family life,  full of hopes and dreams, attractive, very  empathetic, loves anything beautiful, musically  inclined, loves to travel to exotic places,  restless, capricious, honest, can be influenced  but is not easy to live with when pressured,  sometimes demanding, good intuition, suffers in  love until they find that one loyal, steadfast  partner; loves to make others laugh   Artist: Maroon 5 Lyrics  Song: This Love Lyrics    (I'm no guy, but i lauvvv t'is song!)  I was so high I did not recognize The fire burning in her eyes The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane Never to return again But always in my heart  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I tried my best to feed her appetite Keep her coming every night So hard to keep her satisfied Kept playing love like it was just a game Pretending to feel the same Then turn around and leave again  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I'll fix these broken things Repair your broken wings And make sure everything's alright My pressure on your hips Sinking my fingertips Into every inch of you Cause I know that's what you want me to do

      it was night time... and everything else around me was very quiet... i could only hear the crickets chirping, the clocks ticking- both the wall clock and my wrist watch on the table... just like all the other nights i had... i never knew that last night would be different, somewhat peculiar that nobody else could ever imagine...  so i was laying there on my bed... i was staring at the ceiling, making friends with shadows on my wall. all night, i'm hearing voices telling me that i should get some sleep because tomorrow might be good for something... i went on thinking and thinking and thinking for about 30 minutes at most when suddenly i felt an earthquake shaking me off my bed... of course i panicked and stood up... and believe me i was really really scared it almost came to a shock when i saw a gaping hole emerging from my bedroom floor! i repeat, there's a hole in my bedroom floor! just to be sure i'm awake... i opened my bedroom door, peered outside, looked left, and then right... weird... there's only this same deafening silence outside... so i closed back the door and tried to investigate the hole on the floor... when i looked down... i can see a very very bright light that my fear, my shock turned into amazement... i was so amazed, so mesmerized at the site that i saw that something unnatural pushed me to jump right in... and so i did... then i saw an empty, very dark void... i'm lost...  when i woke up... everything was really really really bright... when i regained consciousness, i realized that i'm in this room... in an old medieval room and when i looked outside the huge window, i could see a beautiful and breathtaking beauty of the rugged coastline... where am i? i asked myself... just as i probed my mind for the answers, the heavy wooden door creaked open... then a man my age came through the door glad to know that i'm awake... he's wearing this swaddling clothes as if he worked as a houseboy in that place... he was talking to me like that of Shakespeare's novels... Old English. I wasn't able to catch up all that he said, what I understood from his gestures and some words from his mouth were... I'm in the inner walls of the Tintagel Castle. The Tintagel Castle? Where the hell is the Tintagel Castle?! Oh my gosh! I don't believe it. I never believe anything like this to happen on earth, only in dreams, or maybe nightmares. I kept pinching myself real hard to wake up... Wake up! Wake up! I could be dreaming... This is not real. This is not real. This is not real! Then the man... looked at me as if I'm a deranged crazy woman hurting herself. He came to me and stopped me... Shook me real hard and hugged me tight. He kept telling me, something that sounded like "It's okay! Everything will be alright..." Then it dawned on me, I'm really really really really scared. Too afraid that all I could do was cry... i kept thinking about how I could go back to the "real" world, my parents will be looking for me, my brother, i have to go back to training, to work, to earn money, shit! i can't stay here! and it made me cry even more... :( i cried myself to sleep, with that guy stroking the hair on my head... i didn't even know his name...  when i woke up... guess what? yes, i got puffed eyes that morning... but other than that, when i opened my eyes... the guy was there sitting on the bedside with his hands on his face looking down on the floor, he looked agitated... when i rose up, he stood up... then i told him to just sit down and he did... i was about to scrutinize him about where i am and how i got there... he started blabbing and blabbing... and to sum up his story, it went out like this...  he was on his way to clean the stables when he passed by the arena where a battle was held and his brother he called Sir Kay was involved. He lost his sword during his previous fight... he was speaking real fast that i have to ask him over and over again to speak slow... and now... His brother asked him to get him another sword for him, which he did... and he got it from the huge marble stone before their cathedral door. This is where the sword was thrusted deep unto the stone... At the mention of the sword thrusted on the stone... this all seemed sooooo familiar, so i asked him who he was...   i felt goosebumps all over when he told me what his name was... arthur.   OH MY GOSH! King Arthur, in my dream?! is this real? and i screamed out loud "Sashi, wake up! Wake up! Wake up!" almost tearing out my hair, then he came near me, held both my shoulders, looked me straight in my eyes and told me that it's alright, it's not a dream and that i came to his place with a purpose... but what??? so he told me he wanted to show me something... he wanted to show me why he was so bothered... he led me past big doors down the stairs, to the dining hall then to cathedral where the great stone stood... and right below the stone... it read: "Whoso Pulleth Out this Sword from the Anvil That same is Rightwise King- Born of England." So then, i was beginning to think that i'm already crazy... i'm in the past... and i'm awake. i brought out a piece of paper from my pocket, it's actually a copy of my clearance from my previous account... i wrote down the line above with a folded leaf then placed it back in my pocket... this should serve as a proof. whatever happens... when i turned back to look at arthur... he was gone... and i'm standing right behind my bedroom door where bags, belts, and used pants were hanging... i hurriedly searched through my pocket for my clearance. it is there. then i had goosebumps again... when i wiped off the sweat from my forehead... the clock striked 12 midnight. i don't know why i counted the chimes but yeah i did, 1, 2... 12... (silence, then) dong! 13 dingdongs... yes, i heard 13 dingdongs... and i was shit scared...  so that's what happened...  scary bah?

       Are You In Love with a girl like me? A Piscean? Feb 18 - Mar 19    (Haha!)  If you are in love with a Pisces man or woman, give him or her attention and sympathy. You have met here an individual who will quietly listen to the tales of your days -- good and bad - and desires only the same consideration in return. Gentle and caring, he (she) provides a safe haven in any kind of weather and can be counted upon to get you back on track. Make sure that you do the same. Little gifts are greatly appreciated here and they need not be expensive. The idea of the token of your affection keeps this individual smiling and returning the favor with surprises of his (her) own. Snuggle-bunnies (hugs) or other displays of tenderness are also essential for true happiness with this mate. You may need to make a conscientious effort to keep him or her talking about his (her) feelings. Though deeply emotional inside, this particular sign -- more than others -- is prone to suffer in silence rather than speak out about personal irritations or letdowns. Disaster lurks down that road as unexpressed emotions carry a punch far greater than expressed ones. Make sure that the lines of communication stay open and you can avoid this pitfall. Don't be alarmed when this honey desires to spend time alone; it is essential for his (her) mental health. Pisces doesn't have as strong an aura as many of the other signs do and needs to re-charge the batteries without anyone else around from time to time. Kindness also pays off in this match. Often polite, he (she) generally is not fond of harsh words or rude phrases. You have found here a person who prizes serenity above all else and one who will appreciate your efforts to keep the waters calm. Once acquired, this bond will be long-lived and true blue.

       Want to understand men? Read on...   1. The nice men are not handsome. 2. The handsome men are not nice. 3. The handsome and nice men are gay. 4. The handsome, nice and heterosexual men are married. 5. The men who are not so handsome, but are nice men, have no money. 6. The men who are not so handsome, but are nice men with money think we are only after their money. 7. The handsome men without money are after our money. 8. The handsome men, who are not so nice and somewhat heterosexual, don't think we are beautiful enough. 9. The men who think we are beautiful, that are heterosexual, somewhat nice and have money, are cowards. 10. The men who are somewhat handsome, somewhat nice and have some money and  thank God are heterosexual, are shy and NEVER MAKE THE FIRST MOVE!!!! 11. The men who never make the first move, automatically lose interest in us when we take the initiative. NOW ....WHO IN THE HELL UNDERSTANDS MEN?  Men are like a fine wine. They all start out like grapes,  and it's a woman's job to stomp on them and keep them in the dark until they mature into something you'd like to have dinner with.  THIS IS SENT TO A SMART WOMAN (that's me!!!) WHO NEED A LAUGH AND CAN BE SENT TO ANY GUYS THAT CAN HANDLE IT!

       My Perception of Men   You can't trust them. Liars. Pretentious. They can make you believe that:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dead can come back to life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dove can turn to black. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that bats can sleep downside up.  And so I got this text message:  "I just hope your perception of men don't become you. Sayang."	.  Ouch. Striking. But he's got a point.  Sigh.  Maybe that comment came out because... (NO lightbulb moment) uh... I don't know.  One thing I know... I don't want to BECOME what I perceive men to be.  :)

      i love blogger! hehehe. something i read in my bulk mails...   The Cookies  At an airport one night With several long hours Before her flight. She hunted for a book In an airport shop, Bought a bag of cookies And found a place to drop.  She was engrossed in her book But happened to see, That the man sitting beside her, As bold as could be, Grabbed a cookie or two From the bag in between, Which she tried to ignore To avoid a scene.  So she munched the cookies And watched the clock, As the gutsy cookie thief Diminished her stock. She was getting more irritated As the minutes ticked by, Thinking, "If I wasn't so nice, I would blacken his eye."  With each cookie she took, He took one too, When only one was left, She wondered what he would do. With a smile on his face, And a nervous laugh, He took the last cookie And broke it in half.  He offered her half, As he ate the other, She snatched it from him And thought.... ooh, brother! This guy had some nerve And he's also rude, Why he didn't even show Any gratitude!  She had never known When she been so galled, And sighed with relief When her flight was called. She gathered her belongings And headed to the gate, Refusing to look back At the thieving ingrate.  She boarded the plane, And sank in her seat, Then she sought her book, Which was almost complete. As she reached in her baggage, She gasped with surprise, There was her bag of cookies, In front of her eyes.  If mine are here, She moaned in despair, The others were his, And he tried to share. Too late to apologize, She realized with grief, That she was the rude one, The ingrate, the thief!  How many times have we absolutely known that something was a certain  way, only to discover later that what we believed to be true... was not?  "Always Keep An Open Mind And An Open Heart,  Because You Just Never Know.... "You might be eating someone else's cookies."  Forwarded to me by: Hegi Thank you hegi! Muah muah!

       ~Something cute that I stole somewhere.  When you need someone  To talk to I hope you will Talk to me  When you need someone To laugh with I hope you will Laugh with me  When you need someone To advise you I hope you will Turn to me  When you need someone To help you I hope you will Let me help you  I cherish and love Everything about you- My beautiful friend And I will always support you As a sister, as a person and as a friend.   KEEPING A RELATIONSHIP  It's best to wait for the one you want than settle for the one available. Best to wait for the one you love than one who's around. Best to wait for the right one because life's too short to be wasted on just someone.   An African proverb states, "Before you get married, keep both eyes open and after you marry, close one eye."   Before you get involved and make a commitment to someone, don't let lust, desperation, immaturity, ignorance, pressure from others or a low self - esteem make you blind to warning signs.   Keep your eyes open, and don't fool yourself that you can change someone or that what you see as faults isn't really that important.   Once you decide to commit to someone, over time, their flaws, vulnerabilities, pet peeves and differences will become more obvious.   If you love your mate and want the relationship to grow and evolve, you've got to learn how to close one eye and not let every little thing bother you.   You and your mate have many expectations, emotional needs, values, dreams, weaknesses and strengths.   Neither one of you is perfect, but are you perfect for each other? Do you bring out the best in each other? Do you compliment and compromise with each other, or do you compete, compare and control? What do you bring to the relationship? Do you bring past relationships, past hurts, past mistrust, past pain?   You can't take somone to the altar because you want to alter him or her. You can't make someone love you, or make someone stay.   If you develop self-esteem, spiritual discernment, and "a life" you won't find yourslef making someone else responsible for your happiness or responsible for your pain.   Manipulation, control, jealousy, neediness, and selfishness are not the ingredients of a thriving, healthy, loving and lasting relationship.   Seeking status, sex and security are the wrong reasons to be in a relationship.   Love is when you take away the feeling,  the passion and the romance in a relationship and  find out that you still care for that person.   Love is being able to walk arm in arm... even when you don't see eye to eye.   Never say goodbye when you still want to try.   Never give up when you still feel you can take it. Never say you no longer love a person when you can't let go.   Love!  It's the nicest feeling in the world!

       Want a Donut?   There was a certain Professor of Religion named Dr. Christianson, a studious man who taught at a small college in the Western United States. Dr. Christianson taught the required survey course in Christianity at this particular institution. Every student was required to take this course his or her freshman year regardless of his or her major. Although Dr. Christianson tried hard to communicate the essence of the gospel in his class, he found that most of his students looked upon the course as nothing but required drudgery. Despite his best efforts, most students refused to take Christianity seriously.     This year, Dr. Christianson had a special student named Steve. Steve was only a freshman, but was studying with the intent of going onto seminary for the ministry. Steve was popular, he was well liked, and he was an imposing physical specimen. He was now the starting center on the school football team, and was the best student in the professor's class.   One day, Dr. Christianson asked Steve to stay after class so he could talk with him. "How many push-ups can you do?" Steve said, "I do about 200 every night." "200? That's pretty good, Steve," Dr. Christianson said. "Do you think you could do 300?" Steve replied, "I don't know... I've never done 300 at a time." "Do you think you could?" again asked Dr. Christianson. "Well, I can try," said Steve. "Can you do 300 in sets of 10? I have a class project in mind and I need you to do about 300 push-ups in sets of ten for this to work. Can you do it? I need you to tell me you can do it," said the professor. Steve said, "Well... I think I can...yeah, I can do it." Dr. Christianson said, "Good! I need you to do this on Friday. Let me explain what I have in mind."   Friday came and Steve got to class early and sat in the front of the room. When class started, the professor pulled out a big box of donuts. No these weren't the normal kinds of donuts, they were the extra fancy BIG kind, with cream centers and frosting swirls. Everyone was pretty excited: it was Friday, the last class of the day, and they were going to get an early start on the weekend with a party in Dr. Christianson's class.   Dr. Christianson went to the first girl in the first row and asked, "Cynthia, do you want to have one of these donuts?" Cynthia said, "Yes." Dr. Christianson then turned to Steve and sked, "Steve, would you do ten push-ups so that Cynthia can have a donut?" "Sure." Steve jumped down from his desk to do a quick ten. Then Steve again sat in his desk. Dr. Christianson put a donut on Cynthia's desk.     Dr. Christianson then went to Joe, the next person, and asked, "Joe, do you want a donut?" Joe said, "Yes." Dr. Christianson sked, "Steve would you do ten push-ups so Joe can have a donut?" Steve did ten push-ups, Joe got a donut. And so it went, down the first aisle, Steve did ten pushups for every person before they got their donut. And down the second aisle, till Dr. Christianson came to Scott. Scott was on the basketball team, and in as good condition as Steve. He was very popular and never lacking for female companionship. When the professor asked, "Scott do you want a donut?" Scott's reply was, "Well, can I do my own pushups?" Dr. Christianson said, "No, Steve has to do them." Then Scott said, "Well, I don't want one then." Dr. Christianson shrugged and then turned to Steve and asked, "Steve, would you do ten pushups so Scott can have a donut he doesn't want?" With perfect obedience Steve started to do ten pushups. Scott said, "HEY! I said I didn't want one!" Dr. Christianson said, "Look, this is my classroom, my class, my desks, and these are my donuts. Just leave it on the desk if you don't want it." And he put a donut on Scott's desk.     Now by this time, Steve had begun to slow down a little. He just stayed on the floor between sets because it took too much effort to be getting up and down. You could start to see a little perspiration coming out around his brow. Dr. Christianson started down the third row. Now the students were beginning to get a little angry. Dr. Christianson asked Jenny, "Jenny, do you want a donut?" Sternly, Jenny said, "No." Then Dr. Christianson asked Steve, "Steve, would you do ten more Push-ups so Jenny can have a donut that she doesn't want?" Steve did ten....Jenny got a donut.     By now, a growing sense of uneasiness filled the room. The students were beginning to say "No" and there were all these uneaten donuts on the desks. Steve also had to really put forth a lot of extra effort to get these pushups done for each donut. There began to be a small pool of sweat on the floor beneath his face, his arms and brow were beginning to get red because of the physical effort involved.   Dr. Christianson asked Robert, who was the most vocal unbeliever in the class, to watch Steve do each push up to make sure he did the full ten pushups in a set because he couldn't bear to watch all of Steve's work for all of those uneaten donuts. He sent Robert over to where Steve was so Robert could count the set and watch Steve closely. Dr. Christianson started down the fourth row.     During his class, however, some students from other classes had wandered in and sat down on the steps along the radiators that ran down the sides of the room. When the professor realized this, he did a quick count and saw that now there were 34 students in the room. He started to worry if Steve would be able to make it. Dr. Christianson went on to the next person and the next and the next. Near the end of that row, Steve was really having a rough time. He was taking a lot more time to complete each set.     Steve asked Dr. Christianson, "Do I have to make my nose touch on each one?" Dr. Christianson thought for a moment, "Well, they're your pushups. You are in charge now. You can do them any way that you want." And Dr. Christianson went on.     A few moments later, Jason, a recent transfer student, came to the room and was about to come in when all the students yelled in one voice, "NO! Don't come in! Stay out!" Jason didn't know what was going on. Steve picked up his head and said, "No, let him come." Professor Christianson said, "You realize that if Jason comes in you will have to do ten pushups for him?" Steve said, "Yes, let him come in. Give him a donut."     Dr. Christianson said, "Okay, Steve, I'll let you get Jason's out of the way right now. Jason, do you want a donut?" Jason, new to the room hardly knew what was going on. "Yes," he said, "give me a donut." "Steve, will you do ten push-ups so that Jason can have a donut?" Steve did ten pushups  very slowly and with great effort. Jason, bewildered, was handed a donut and sat down.     Dr. Christianson finished the fourth row, then started on those visitors seated by the heaters. Steve's arms were now shaking with each push-up in a struggle to lift himself against the force of gravity. Sweat was profusely dropping off of his face and, by this time, there was no sound except his heavy breathing, there was not a dry eye in the room.     The very last two students in the room were two young women, both cheerleaders, and very popular. Dr. Christianson went to Linda, the second to last, and asked, "Linda, do you want a doughnut?" Linda said, very sadly, "No, thank you." Professor Christianson quietly asked, "Steve, would you do ten push-ups so that Linda can have a donut she doesn't want?" Grunting from the effort, Steve did ten very slow pushups for Linda. Then Dr. Christianson turned to the last girl, Susan. "Susan, do you want a donut?" Susan, with tears flowing down her face, began to cry. "Dr. Christianson, why can't I help him?"     Dr. Christianson, with tears of his own, said, "No, Steve has to do it alone, I have given him this task and he is in charge of seeing that everyone has an opportunity for a donut whether they want it or not. When I decided to have a party this last day of class, I looked at my grade book. Steve, here is the only student with a perfect grade. Everyone else has failed a test, skipped class, or offered me inferior work. Steve told me that in football practice, when a player messes up he must do push-ups. I told Steve that none of you could come to my party unless he paid the price by doing your push ups. He and I made a deal for your sakes. Steve, would you do ten push-ups so Susan can have a donut?" As Steve very slowly finished his last pushup, with the understanding that he had accomplished all that was required of him, having done 350 pushups, his arms buckled beneath him and he fell to the floor.     Dr. Christianson turned to the room and said. "And so it was, that our Savior, Jesus Christ, on the cross, plead to the Father, 'into thy hands commend my spirit.' With the understanding that He had done everything that was required of Him, he yielded up His life. And like some of those in this room, many of us leave the gift on the desk, uneaten." Two students helped Steve up off the floor and to a seat, physically exhausted, but wearing a thin smile. "Well done, good and faithful servant," said the professor, adding "Not all sermons are preached in words." Turning to his class the professor said, "My wish is that you might  understand and fully comprehend all the riches of grace and mercy that have been given to you through the sacrifice of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He spared not only His Begotten Son, but gave Him up for us all for the whole Church, now and forever. Whether or not we choose to accept His gift to us, the price has been paid. Wouldn't you be foolish and ungrateful to leave it laying on the desk?"

      yesterday i was in ayala again... cuz i worked 7am-3pm, and if i stay in my BH after work, it would be super boring... so imagine you have this card and once you buy one shake you can get to watch a movie for free... what are you going to do with it? yes, i bought one shake and watched the movie 'Love Actually'. it was okay. i like that part about the guy who's heart was wasted because he love the wife of his bestfriend, the part where he went to the girl's house and just showed her some placards just to tell her she's perfect and will always be beautiful... it's just... wow. so then i went to the grocery and buy me one big junkfood so i can store it in my canister...   though i don't have enough money, i ate in jollibee... and the jollibee mascot was there... later i realized there was a children's party... so my point is... i'm really amazed seeing the eyes of those kids so happy, as if they saw their superhero with them... then i reminisce the days when i was a little kid myself... i saw me in our auditorium in Lourdes GS, an all girls school... and there was Sucy and Geno onstage... and we would get so excited that we all wanted to touch Sucy's hair. i'd start imagining things like... what if they'd see me, be with me and all the girls in school would envy me. wow. so again my point is... it's beautiful seeing little happy kids! period...  so then i remember myself when i was in high school and i always, always believe that high school kids have very creative imaginations... so i used this to a hilt that i was able to write a short story about santa clause... i let my friends read it and they really liked it... because it was a love story of bernard, the elf... and well another character, female, darn i forgot the name. santa saw her as he came down the chimney, the girl was bruised and hurt and was unconscious so santa had to take her to the north pole so his elves can take care of her... well then, she met elf bernard... and bernard started to like her... yada yada... it was really a nice story... sad to say i lost it because i just wrote it on a grade 3 pad paper... (yes, i was in high school but i used to keep pad papers like this in case i wanted to write something, you know)... well that's about it. got to go. bye.   songs i like:    urlLink All My Life  - K-C & Jojo  urlLink Don't Go Away  - Oasis  urlLink I'm With You  - Avril Lavigne  urlLink Maybe  - Side A  urlLink Stick Around  - Azure  urlLink Rainbow  - South Border  urlLink This Love  - Maroon 5  urlLink Under The Bridge  - Red Hot Chilli Peppers  Lyrics source:  urlLink http://www.letssingit.com  ...and etchetera...  "Find out what makes you happy and follow what your heart tells you... They may call you fool, but at least you are a happy fool, not a lonely, empty wise person."

      waz in ayala the whole afternoon today. brought with me a good book and read two chapters of it while i waz there... then i went window-shopping and i kinda like spending time with myself alone... actually, it's an understatement. so let me resentence that - i ENJOY spending time with sashi alone... with this book (that is)...   °it amazes me cuz seems like the band 'dice and canine' was there... and i really do appreciate their talents.  a lot of things can amaze me...  °it makes me happy seeing group of friends chitchatting at a nearby table, and one of them trying to look at what i was reading...  °i love riding the jeepney and passing by street alleys where i used to walk before.  °i like asking favor to the person next to me to pass my fare for me... then say thank you.  °it gives a smile on my face seeing a cute little baby girl asleep on her stroller.  °i enjoy seeing people sitting nearby shoes stalls and looking around... observing other people too, like i usually do.  °it's nice to know how people can tolerate standing in front of a for-sale TV with the movie "Finding Nemo"  showing on it. I was one of them, though i barely made it on the 15th minute.  °i enjoy seeing myself on a mirror as i made my way up the escalator and later tell myself... "you look horrible on what you're wearing right now! you need new sandals!!"Ü  °i had fun seeing two little boys playing and was burried on a heap of plastic balls.  °i like passing by pizza hut, checking out the price per piece, but not really buying 'em cuz i think it would be better to eat on another place.  °most of all, i like reading alone, in a very nice comfortable corner of ayala... with my highlighter, with my book... where nobody sees me... and nobody knows that i'm "seeing" them... i'm observing them... i enjoy knowing the normality of it all... the wonders of the living things working around me... busy talking... busy playing... busy texting... busy eating... busy staring at the small TV screen that shows different sorts of trailers... parents with their kids... people going down the escalator... sigh... just beautiful! soooo perfect...  i was on a jeepney before i got here... and i had a lot of things in my mind... juz right in front of me were two lovers... well, it's a pretty sight but it reminds me of other things and it kinda makes me feel lonely... teehee! but that's okay... it was actually a choice that i made but somehow... i couldn't figure it out now why i have to let go of something... nice and wonderful... and breathtakingly beautiful... and i was thinking of... *sashi knelt on one of her knees, raised both hands, and looked up the sky... then shouted... "SUPERSTAHHHH!!!"*

       THE IMPULSIVE TEST    urlLink http://www.queendom.com/tests/minitests/fx/impulsive.html    How impulsive are you?  My score = 45       What does your score mean? While you've certainly got a streak of spontaneity flowing through your veins, you're generally able to balance it with a dash of common sense. When the mood is right and something strikes your fancy, you may just do something without reflecting on its possible consequences. This tendency may even have gotten you into some sticky situations. On the whole, however, you try to use your head and pull back on the reins This seems to be healthy approach - while spontaneity can be fun and open up new doors, it can also lead to trouble. Balance is the key!   THE REALITY TEST    urlLink http://www.queendom.com/tests/minitests/fx/reality.html    How realistic are you?  My score = 85   What does your score mean? Yes, reality bites…but you'd rather face the cold hard truth than be disappointed later on. You tend to see things the way they are and don't wear any rose-colored glasses to filter the unpleasant side of life. While this perspective serves as a protective shield against broken dreams and shattered hopes, it could also make the world seem much more cruel and bleak. If you don't let yourself suspend your critical eye and float in the clouds once in awhile, what will motivate you to go for your dreams? Dreams do sometimes come true, but you can guarantee yours won't if you don't have a little faith. Belief is truly magical!   THE KINKY TEST    urlLink http://www.queendom.com/tests/minitests/fx/kinky.html    Are you kinky?  My score = 15   What does your score mean? You are conservative-minded when it comes to sexuality. It seems that you prefer to keep your sexual experiences within the range of the tried and true. Your tendency towards traditional values is such that you may feel threatened, opposed to, or even offended by sexual behavior that is slightly outside the parameters you have set for sexual normalcy. You are generally a subdued sexual animal and seem to shy away from sex play that is on the daring side. In fact, you seem down right reluctant to venture into the jungle of sexual experimentation. Perhaps you are caged by feelings of guilt and shame? One word of caution: your idea of normalcy may or may NOT correspond to what is actually "normal". You may be prone to being judgmental, which is potentially hurtful to others.   THE LOVE TEST    urlLink http://www.queendom.com/tests/minitests/fx/love.html   My score = 35       What does your score mean? While you wouldn't do it all for love, you would do a heck of a lot! You're generous but have certain limits on how far you'd go in the name of love, which is a pretty healthy approach. Sure, you need to give love to get love, but give too much and you can turn into a human doormat. You are able to put your foot down and think of yourself from time to time while still making the effort to show your loved one that you care. You're generally loyal and bighearted and you expect the same from your partner. It's a delicate balance, but it's essential to building strong, mutually-respectful relationships. Keep it up and you should be on your way to some good lovin'!

       the lonely truth   you thought i'm strong and emotionally stable you thought i'm different from everybody else yet here i lay, crying myself to sleep  nobody understands why i look happy even when i'm sad why i look strong even when i'm weak why i look okay even when i'm not...  it's the questions left unanswered it's the feelings left unsaid it's the truth left hidden it's the promise left unfulfilled  i thought i was strong, enough to be heartless, enough to stay numb, enough to forget, enough to move on...   but i guess i was wrong...  sigh.

       is all fair in love and war?   i believe you've never been in a relationship where you loved and was loved as well... it's never fair when both of you had that love but can't do anything to make it work. you feel his pain, and that hurts you, but you have to look tough, numb or even heartless because you know it's for your own good, because you're using your mind above your heart. so you have to hide the fact that you were hurt in the process too... and that makes you a liar, and that's exactly what makes love unfair...  bow.

       Here's something I'd like to share:   God knows what He's doing for all of us. He is the potter and we are His clay. He will mold us and make us, so that we may be made into a flawless piece of work to fulfill His good, pleasing, and perfect will.  God has a perfect plan for your life. He may need to place some struggles in your life to strengthen your character so that you may be strong in the days of greater adversity. Don't get discouraged when you feel like the heat of the struggle is going to burn you. God knows exactly when to pull you out and deliver you from that problem, and when He does you will be much wiser and stronger than you were before. God will never give to us more than we are able to withstand, so remind yourself that if many problems are coming your way, it is only because God knows your inner strength and ability to be strong even in the midst of a problem.

       Void   i felt super sad this morning... two of my friends left for Manila... :( Kristine and Marvin... maybe i'll see them soon after 6 months... maybe i won't... sigh... just so you will know, they are one of the most wonderful people i know... and i'm super happy to have met them... i just felt a feeling of emptiness without them... i know we don't see each other that much (in Marvin's case) but, it's a lot different when you know they're just 'there' even if you don't see them as much, compared to knowing that they're 'there', but they're just too far away (in distance)... know what i'm sayin'?  and the only explanation i can think of is... because when they're 'there' and they're near... you usually take that forgranted because you know you can just call them anytime, ask them out anytime, see them anytime, give them a pat anytime, or hug them anytime...   now that they're still 'there' but physically far away... that's the only time you'll realize that you missed those moments when you should have called them and asked them out for a drink, have seen them or have given them pats or hugs... or played billiards with them (yes Marvs, we should have played billiards some time katong naa pa ka dre...Ü) or i should have tried to load P30 so i could text back to Kristine when she texted me... sigh. i should have...  anyway, what's done is done... all i can say is... i will always pray for their happiness, contentment, health and safety... for the rest of their lives... MUCH LOVE TO YOU MY FRIENDS! You'll always have a special place in my heart. i swear!Ü  hope they're reading this...

      Welcome to my rage.  Again.  Sorry for the long silence... I need a lot of time to think about the things I want to say in defense of... myself. Alright... Let's talk. Pull out that chair and sit in front of me. I want this settled now.  Friends, those of you sitting there comfortably on your seats... Just watch, and listen to us as we talk things over... Turn on the stage lights. Let the curtains separate so there, You can see both of us...   So he started:  ~"You never bothered to reply. Not until this time. That's one thing I hate about you because you're so insensitive to other's needs. I badly needed his number. I wasn't being demanding."  In short... "You're insensitive!"  You knew where I was. You knew I was busy at that time. You knew I couldn't text back. How come you never gave way? What made me insensitive there??? When your first message came, I replied but you never probed on my message to get the information that you need. You jumped into conclusion and declared that what I sent you was a crap. Which is not. That was the information that you need. THAT was my ANSWER, and you deleted it. And now you're freaking mad at me. Just because I wasn't able to text back... Because you think I was selfish...  ~"I was just expecting a favorable response  yet you let me starve for it. I didn't demand. I just requested a favor. By the way I heard rumors about you. It seems not true but now you're affirming it."  Let you STARVED FOR THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED? Are you sure? That's exaggeration man! Why don't you look at the other side of the coin?! And What does rumor have to do with the issue? The hell with rumors! I don't care. I don't mind. Rumors are plus bad things minus good things... That's just how it goes. And that's bullshit. Are you gay or something? WHEN DOES A GUY CARE ABOUT RUMORS ANYWAY? Do you want facts? Here are facts.  Yes, I went out and played billiards with friends.  Yes, I drank beer with them.  Yes, I was able to smoke cigarette sometime ago.  Yes, I went to disco houses and danced and learned how to grind.  Yes, during those times... I got home around 2:30 AM.  I hated.  I lied.  Sure, I'm a sinner. That's all you can see right? ALL THE BAD THINGS. Do you want more???   And Just so you will know. THESE ARE FACTS. THESE AREN'T RUMORS. FACTS. F-A-C-T-S. GET IT?  ~"Napuno na ka nako?  Grabe sad. Mura sad kag si kinsa da. If you recall all that passed between us you did more mistakes than what I did. INSENSITIVE LANG KA WHILE I'M NOT. THAT makes us different!"  If you recall all that passed between us you did more mistakes than what I did. INSENSITIVE LANG KA WHILE I'M NOT. -HUWHAAAATTTT??!! *I stood up and paced the staged. Thinking.* Ladies and gentlemen... I don't know what the hell this man is talking about. He used to be a very good friend of mine. Now he's telling me that I made most mistakes? Between us? and again- I'm insensitive??? If I made the most mistakes (which is the only thing you see, somehow, I don't know why...)- why dint you tell me? I'm not Madame Auring who can read your mind you know. I'm not Superman, I'm not the Flash. I'm not Captain America. I'm not David Blaine. I'm not any magician... YOU HAVE TO TELL ME. If you hate me, are mad at me, despise me, love me, like me- THEN TELL ME! I won't say I'm insensitive. Basically because i have NO ASSUMPTIONS. I won't conclude things unless I'm sure of it... And THAT'S NOT INSENSITIVITY. That's being true to what's real and not to some illusions, assumptions or whatever. It's ACCEPTANCE TO WHAT'S ON HAND. Not insensitivity.  So I'm done with my rattlings. I'm sorry if I was able to say things that can hurt you. Maybe I meant it, maybe i don't. All I know is, this place is the only place where I can let all things out... AND NEVER IN THE REAL WORLD... because I'm a coward. because even if i say hurtful things that's because i was hurt too, and it doesn't mean i don't care. i do care. i just have a different way of showing it. i will cool down... that i can pwomise...  I don't know why that's all people see, the bad things...  I rest my case.  Peace out.  HIRIT: Yes. So I was mean. and I felt bad. But that was how I felt when I wrote that blog. Should you want to shoot me... Go ahead.Ü Make your day.Ü

      Here’s something I stole somewhere…    I FORGOT  I forgot what life is all about... I forgot what it meant to cry... I forgot that pretending to be happy doesn't make you happy... And that pretending to be smart doesn't make you smart... I forgot that you can't just forget the past in fear of the future... I forgot that you can't control falling in love... And that you can't make yourself fall in love.... And if you really do fall in love then u can't make yourself fall OUT of love... I learned that I can love... I learned that it's okay to messup... And it's okay to ask for help... And it's okay to feel like crap... I learned it's okay to complain and whine to all your friends for a whole day... I learned that sometimes the things you want most, you just can't have.  I learned that the greatest thing about life isn't the parties or the hook-ups... It's the friendships, which means taking chances... I learned that sometimes the things we want to forget are the things which we most need to talk about... I learned that letters from friends are the most important things.  And that sending cards to your friends makes you feel better. But,basically, I just learned that my friends both old and new are the most important people to me in the world...  AND... without them, I wouldn't be who I am today... So this is a thank you to all of my friends. For always being there. And even if we are not in good terms any more or we have lost touch...  I still care for you thanks for being a part of my life.  Take care.Ü

      Yes, I do Love God.  HE is my source of existence and Savior. He keeps me functioning each and every day. Without Him, I am nothing. He is my source of strength...  I went to Ayala yesterday spending  P 4.00  as my jeepney fare. I watched the Passion of the Christ at  Cinema 4  together with my ELIM brothers and sisters. I sat on  Seat No. 4 .  What does that mean?   Here is a true story by Paul Harvey. You will be surprised who this young man turns out to be.   (Do not look at the bottom of this article until you have read it fully.)  Years ago a hardworking man took his family from New York State to Australia to take advantage of a work opportunity there. Part of this man's family was a handsome young son who had aspirations of joining the circus as a trapeze artist or an actor. This young fellow, biding his time until a circus job or even one as a stagehand came along, worked at the local shipyards which bordered on the worse section of town. Walking home from work one evening this young man was attacked by five thugs who wanted to rob him. Instead of just giving up his money the young fellow resisted. However, they bested him easily and proceeded to beat his body brutally with clubs, leaving him for dead. When the police happened to find him lying in the road they assumed he we dead and called for the Morgue Wagon. On the way to the morgue a policeman heard him gasp for air, and they immediately took him to the emergency unit at the hospital. When the was placed on a gurney a nurse remarked to her horror, that this young man no longer had a face. Each eye socket was smashed, his skull, legs, and arms fractured, his nose literally hanging from his face, all his teeth were gone, and his jaw was almost completely torn from his skull. Although his life was spared, he spent over a year in the hospital. When he finally left, his body may have healed but his face was disgusting to look at. He was no longer the handsome youth that everyone admired. When the young man started to look for work again he was turned down by everyone just on account of the way he looked. One potential employer suggested to him that he join the freak show at the circus as "The Man Who Had No Face". And he did this for a while. He was still rejected by everyone and no one wanted to be seen in his company. He had thoughts of suicide. This went on for five years. One day he passed a church and sought some solace there. Entering the church he encountered a priest who had seen him sobbing while kneeling in a pew. The priest took pity on him and took him to the rectory where they talked at length. The priest was impressed with him to such a degree that he said that he would do everything possible for him that could be done to restore his dignity and life, if the young man would promise to be the best Catholic he could be, and trust in God's mercy to free him from his torturous life. The young man went to Mass and communion  everyday and after thanking God for saving his life, asked God to only give him peace of mind and the grace to be the best man he could ever be in His eyes. The priest, through his personal contacts was able to secure the services of the best plastic surgeon in Australia. There would be no cost to the young man as the doctor was the priest's best friend. The doctor too was so impressed by the young man, whose outlook now on life, even though he had experienced the worst, was filled with good humor and love. The surgery was a miraculous success. All the best dental work was also done for him. The young man became everything he promised God he would be.   He was also blessed with a wonderful, beautiful wife, many children, and success in an industry which would have been the furthest thing from his mind as a career, if not for the goodness of God and the love of the people who cared for him.  This he acknowledges publicly.  The young man. Mel Gibson. His life was the inspiration for his production of the movie "The Man Without A Face". He is to be admired by all of us as a God fearing man, a political conservative, and an example to all as a true man of courage.  Mel Gibson has produced the movie "The Passion of the Christ". This is his way of thanking God for his many blessings. And it's also his way of showing us how Christ truly suffered. He's gotten a lot of slack from Hollywood for doing this movie. Go see the movie released on Feb. 25. It will change your life forever!  REVELATIONS 22:21  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen!

      this afternoon, i felt super sad... and i cried again...:( that's because i can't stop remembering my past. how i wish i could turn back time and erase everything so i won't be feeling this way. it sucks. but i don't have a choice, do i? i know it's not healthy for me. and i know it's not even close to 'doing what's best for myself' if i'm gonna write something related to this. call me stupid. call me stubborn. i don't care. this is my only way of relieving how i'm feeling right now. this is my only way of getting close to what i perceive as normal. it's not stupidity, it's not stubborness. it's knowing that there's something you can do about it. as for my case, it's spending time with my keyboard, and type...  i don't want to say anything i WANT to do that i CAN'T do. i don't want to say i won't see him anymore, then see him the next day. i don't want to say i won't text him anymore, then text him after midnight. i don't want to say i will stop thinking about him, then forget i said that. so tonight,  i'm not going to say any of my 'i will do this', 'i won't do that' lines... ugh. i just did that when i said  i'm not going to say any of my 'i will do this', 'i won't do that' lines.  my bad. so anyway, just bear with me.   i just remember the time when i was in 2nd year college. i was on my way to school, and was walking down the street. right when i passed by the door of the 2nd house, joel got out. he's on his way to his school too. i didn't really know him at that time. and i was a stranger to him as well. we had the usual conversation as we made our way out to where we can get our rides. name, where we are you going, what ride to take, classes, birthdays... yada, yada... as far as i could recall, the only thing that i remembered from our conversation was, october 16, 1981. that's his birthday. and do you know why? it's because i like him the first time we walked that street together...Ü  joel liking or even noticing me is what seems to be an impossibility. he's too good looking. and i am too not-good looking.Ü so i brushed that thought aside, and went on living my life. it was what i considered a one time encounter, so everytime i see him, there was really no "hi hello how are you"s going on. yes, i see him, but i don't really look at him (well, NOT when he's looking.Ü). and i don't want him to think that all girls notice him, well not me. little did i know that my attitude draws him to me. i was actually the only one who doesn't look at him everytime he's visible, even when he's right in front of me. i always look ahead when he's around. joel likes to dance, and because of that we became friends. he came up to me one day and borrowed my NSYNC tape. few days after that he asked if i have this-and-that magazines that he can use... and that's where it all started.  I remember him stopping by our house to surprise me with a box of Dunkin Donuts I remember all the roses he gave me with or without special occasion I remember how we used to have endless chitchats on our terrace I remember him playing me songs with our guitar I remember all the songs he used to sing for me and all the songs we used to sing together I remember him cupping my face with his palms and looking me straight in the eyes and telling me he loves me so much I remember holding his hands as we walked down the street, as we rode on jeepneys I remember how long he had to wait for me from our weekly scheduled school meetings I remember us naming our cute puppy Miming I remember him cooking and preparing food for me I remember us buying avocado from the market and him preparing it for our afternoon snack I remember how he really likes to eat sour mangoes with oyap I remember his 3-paged letter just to express how sorry he was and how much he loves me I remember sitting beside him as we attend the afternoon mass in school I remember him telling me that he is reminded of me everytime we make the "Glory to you oh Lord, Jesus Christ" sign of the cross I remember him laying his head on my shoulders and calling me Baby or Lalang I remember us buying two similar bracelets that we could use together I remember how fond he was with Bob Marley items I remember calling him up to fetch me from my office because i was so sick I remember his company when i went to the doctor for a check up on my prolonged cough I remember him. I remember his love. And I remember how deeply he loved me. I remember Joel and I remember how I used to comb his eyebrows with my thumbs I remember our love. I remember our promises. I remember how I swored to him that we would never part I remember seeing him cry, hearing him cry over the phone just to take me back I remember everything I can feel his pain. I can feel my pain... I can feel OUR pain. Yes, I remember you. I remember how PAINFUL it was to SEE YOU CRY... I remember HOW PAINFUL IT FELT to see you that way...  But things change...   Because even if i remember the first time I went to the beach with him, I ESPECIALLY remembered meeting Gaston the first time. It was in Gusa. We were with Nang Myrna, her hubby and their kids, they were Gaston's relatives. Joel said he met him when they went to Camiguin some time ago. He mentioned he was like a brother to him. Gaston is a good friend. You know why? Because when he and his barkadas have outings he never fails to invite Joel. Because he wasn't going to tell me about Joel's 'bad side' hadn't I forced him to. Because he told me himself he doesn't want to break their friendship because of me. Because he's NOT ON MY SIDE, nor was he on HIS SIDE, yet he was always there for either of us...  Have I told you that Gaston's not his real name?  I'm feeling better now... *sashi stretching and smiling*  It's Dennis.Ü

I finally got the lyrics of the song i have long been looking for! Come on and sing it wit' me...   A Little Bit  by Mymp   I was kinda   hesitant to tell you Should I let you know    I was never really   like this   before    Need I say more     Or maybe I'm   confused when you are near me      I don't know what to do or I should be    There's only one thing in my mind  That's you and me   CHORUS  I'm a little bit of crazy  I'm a little bit of a fool  I'm a little bit of lonely  I'm a little bit of all    Oh, I need a cure  Just a little bit of you  And I will fall     I'm always on the run to   see you    Would you   allow me to    It wasn't my attention to hurt you    This feeling is true     Or maybe I'm   confused when you are near me      I don't know what to do or I should be    There's only one thing in my mind  That's you and me   CHORUS  I'm a little bit of crazy  I'm a little bit of a fool  I'm a little bit of lonely  I'm a little bit of all    Oh, I need a cure  Just a little bit of you  And I will fall     ÜÜÜÜ

      My mind is empty right now. Or maybe full. And i just don't know where to start. Or maybe i dont really have anything to share. Let's just say, nothing exceptional happened...  Reading for today:  Psalms 16(15),1-2.5.7-11.   A miktam of David. Keep me safe, O God; in you I take refuge  I say to the Lord, you are my Lord, you are my only good.  LORD, my allotted portion and my cup, you have made my destiny secure.  I bless the LORD who counsels me; even at night my heart exhorts me.  I keep the LORD always before me; with the Lord at my right, I shall never be  shaken.  Therefore my heart is glad, my soul rejoices; my body also dwells secure,  For you will not abandon me to Sheol, nor let your faithful servant see the  pit.  You will show me the path to life, abounding joy in your presence, the  delights at your right hand forever.    Love Quotes:  I'm feeling mushy today.Ü   No one has ever loved anyone the way everyone wants to be loved.   - Mignon McLaughlin   When the satisfaction or the security of another person becomes as significant to one as one's own satisfaction or security, then the state of love exists.   - Henry Stack Sullivan   If words could say all that we feel, there would be no need for an embrace. But language has its limitations, and the heart has none. It expresses itself spontaneously in even the smallest things we do.    - Robert Sexton   Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence.  - H. L. Mencken   Why Dark Chocolate Cake? Check out Summer 2004 Catalog. Go to page 19.   Dark Chocolate Cake   I wanna eat that. Slurrrrp!  Over and out.Ü

      there are really people who think they know you. it's annoying really. well, they don't, and they can't, and never will, even if you live with them, even if you spend all your waking and sleeping hours with them. there is no way they're going to know who you are completely. never. ever. and sometimes what pisses me off is when they say things as if it were the truth. as if they know something out from wherever autobiography, resources they got that information from. i hate it! maybe hate is such a very strong word but leme just say that and leme also say, 'i really don't like it'. if they don't have any nice things to say. they don't have to say it you know. let it be. maybe i can't tell them straight to their faces, because i'm a coward. i admit  that. and that's because i don't want any trouble at all.   if you want to say or comment anything, please let it not be an invasion of my privacy. don't push me. i don't like it. don't assume you know all about my love life. cuz you don't. better off if you just shut up. i'm sorry but let me be.  so i slept whole day today. i missed lunch. i missed going to church. darn it. and our neighbor is a nuisance. they're playing soooo loud and i can't sleep well. plus, just when i was drifting off to sleep, michael stop by again. this time, i'm just so damn tired to go out my room like i used to, and the sun is too bright it's blinding my sight, i have to ask him to come inside. sowi kie! i just broke rule #1: no guys inside our room! (though i'm very religious with my rule #2: no mosquitoes inside), i just made a mistake, and i stand corrected on that. i know it was wrong for me to ask him to come in. i was just super, dead tired to go out! so anyway, he offered me something to eat (but i dint take it mainly because i don't want to eat, I WANT TO SLEEP!), and borrowed my iron. a little chitchat, hi hello how are yous. it went all good basically. it's a shaaaame because i was like asking him to go awaaaay! wapaaak! bad sashi! bad, bad, bad! now if you're wondering how i look... your initial reaction should be... eeeeeek!!! but i don't really care, not unless if he's gaston, i would have to make sure that i look good. teehee! peace out mike!Ü hope you're enjoying your work!  ps. it's only when i'm with my skinny little fingers typing that i'm brave.

      i stared long at the huge plant just outside our door with my mind thinking fast of all the things that settle in sometimes I wonder how long i will have to wait sometimes i even think i am TOO PATIENT to wait  if only i could just go out and leave let him come without me to welcome him if only i could just leave and not come back let him wonder what's wrong, let him wonder why  the nth time, i checked my watch wondering what could have kept him late every tick keeps pushing me to the edge teasing me to leave, bluntly urging me to give up  i shifted on my seat, resting my head on my hand impatiently waiting, mumbling words even i can't understand  in a split second, like a flash of lightning i came to a point of making up my mind...  with a heavy sigh... of LOSING someone i dusted off my pants, i picked up my things it might be a hard choice but at least it's mine i know it's the difference i now have to make  so on that rainiy 3rd of july, 2001 tuesday morning as i walk towards the door to leave, around the corner a guy came walking, heading towards me his smile so kind, his stride so gentle  like the time rewinding back on the first time i met him i reminisce the wonderful moments shared with him...  and in another quick second... also like a flash of lightning... all those thoughts faded away... then i   ...smiled back!Ü

       Would you like to eat orange with me?   I'm in a good mood today!Ü I'm done doing my research, just waiting for my time to take in calls... so it's gonna be me and my thin little midget fingers typing...  I'm wearing Joel's thumb ring tonight!Ü Why? I don't know. Let's just say i was sick sometime ago and it occurred to me "wouldn't it be nice" if somebody could tell you, "Hey, you're sick.   Would you like to eat orange with me?   It's good for your health."Ü Sigh. Oh well, no biggie. I just remembered how wonderful it was to have somebody who could "eat orange with you".Ü That depends on how deeply you understand that, as for me, i don't take that literally. Eating orange means a lot more to me.Ü  It's when you're sick and... you always have somebody whom you could call anytime to pick you up. you always have somebody who always has his umbrella ready when it rains. you always have somebody who's ready with his medicines when you call him out. you always have somebody who can just sit beside you in a jeepney where you can lay your head on his shoulder because you're just too weak to open your eyes. you always have somebody who will make sure you have taken the medicines you needed. you always have somebody who worries over your health. you always have somebody who will take care of you. you always have somebody who can be there for you. you always have somebody who can "eat orange with you".Ü  Now i'm not saying it should be somebody as... your boyfriend or your girlfriend. No, don't get me wrong. I meant a friend, a cousin, a colleague, or yeah, maybe a boyfriend or a girlfriend... as long as it's somebody you can count on when you're sick. Specially if you're away from home and your parents aren't gonna be there to take care of you. Know what i'm sayin'? 'cuz it's hard being alone, and being away. We all need somebody. We all need someone who can eat oranges with us. Wouldn't you agree? Well yeah, i have to admit. Joel eats orange with me.Ü That's why i remember him sometimes when i'm sick.Ü  So anyway, while I was sleeping this afternoon. I was awaken by somebody knocking on my door. Michael. He just arrived from his work. He always stops by to say hi! Sweet.Ü He owes me evangelization!Ü Teehee! Actually he promised me he's gonna talk to me regarding... faith perhaps? I don't know. I'm positive though it's about anything related to Jesus. He's got a beautiful, wonderful personality. The funny thing about Michael is... he's a nautical graduate, now working in a ship. Funny I say, because he's more or less the version of Gaston.Ü Gaston's course is nautical, and get this, he is as old as Michael. Huwhaaaattt does that mean???!  I'm not going to text Gaston first. cuz he might think i'm texting him because of my ex... grrrr! His last text was last monday. FYI.Ü  ~ciao for now.Ü

Gazillion times special!  In advance, HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY DEAR MAMA!Ü BIG HUG! and Happy Birthday also Rose!  That's about it. BTW, I like to sing, and sing, and sing...  "But, oh, can't you see That no matter what happens, life goes on and on And so, baby, just smile' Cause I'm always around you And I'll make you see how beautiful life is for you and me  Take a little time, baby See the butterfly's colors Listen to the birds that were sent to sing for me and you Can you feel me This is such a wonderful place to be"

      Michael already got the job he has long been waiting for... and i'm so happy for him!Ü ~Congratulations mike! On the one side, we may no longer see each other as often like we used to. Too bad, so sad! :( But tat's okay, he's just a text away anyway.   So i got 2 days off, the usual, and today is my 2nd day... last night i went to SM with ate nena and jocelyn to watch jersey girl; the movie aside, what i'm gonna write is nothing related to that... maybe a little because our text messaging occurred right when we watched that movie...  let's just say that i made a picture message on my phone with gaston's name on it... but before i sent it to his phone. i sent him a forwarded message. and do you know what his reply wazzzz???  "Are you missing somebody that's why you texted me? Because I always assume that when you text me, it only means you miss Joel, It's true, right?"  NOTTTT!!!! and i started pulling my hair off... my face red, my ears smokin'... (Aaaaargh!) because he don't even have the slightest clue! i want to move on. he knows that. and the least that i want to hear from him is joel. the LEAST that i want to hear from him is joel (w/ stress). what the heck is wrong wit' him? so then, i told him, it WAS true before. but no longer true NOW. which is veritas by the way. i sweeeeaaarrr! and what i don't understand is why oh why... it has been more than two weeks, TWO weeks (w/ stress) that we hanged out in cagayan... (never mind the why) anyway, so i sent him the picture message... thinking that since i made an effort making that, why not send it to the person, right? ...right? and i must have scared him away cuz he dint text back! waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!! my mistake, my mistake, my mistake, my mistake, MY MISTAKE! (w/ stress) that's what it pays for doing something without thoroughly thinking about it you know...  so that's it, basically what i don't understand is... (never mind what i don't understand) i really have no intention of scaring him away. grrrr... i hate it when i don't even know if it was the right thing to do... sure i can't do anything about it because what's done is done. and i understand that. i mean, how big is that?! it's just a picture message. IT'S JUST A PICTURE MESSAGE with HIS NAME on it that I MADE (w/ stress). and i'm here acting like a deranged lunatic. hehehe! too overstated. or maybe not.  so that is what's bugging me right now. i just need somebody whom i can give my biggest, tightest and wettest hug!!! ~hehehehe! k, so i'm just playin'...Ü    alrighty... later then. muwah!Ü

       confirmed: he got my new number.Ü   gaston texted me today! and i have to constantly remind myself that  CHORUS: nangumusta lang sha sash. no more. no less.  so let me try to tell you how our text messaging went  forwarded message received.  forwarded message sent.  "gaston!Ü i'm a little okay now. my work is helping me a lot..."  "good for you, keep it that way... are both of you still texting each other?" (REPEAT CHORUS)  "he dint know my new number... one last question about him... is he already in cagayan?" "never mind. zip it. don't answer that. i'm going back to sleep now..."  "i won't tell you... it's for your own good. hehehe. i suggest you amuse yourself, treat yourself, go malling... you deserve the best." (REPEAT CHORUS)  teehee! so that's how it went... and it's so nice to know that somebody cares... sluuuurrrrpppp! ~haha! juz playin'!Ü  so iniwi, today today today. what happened to me today? after work (4:30 am), my officemates and i went to a tapsilogan and ate our breakfasts. i got back in my bh and slept. awaken by a text message from mike, asking if i'm awake... so then, i texted back (it's not strange if my life revolves around my celphone), then knock knock knock on my door. i went out to check and see. mike. he needed help. sashi to the rescue!!!Ü yup. i helped a friend today. and it felt good. pat. pat. pat. so we ate brunch. and ate supper later. he wanted to talk to me. i assume he wanted to evangelize me. no biggie. non-defensively, he's just a friend. he's a brother in Christ. No more. No less.  Script from the Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John 15,9-17: "It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain, so that   whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you. This I command you: love one another  ."

       i'm no longer afraid of cockroaches   yes. those tiny crawling dungy creatures won't scare me anymore. as long as it's not within 0.5 meter radial distance. that's the considerable, as well as the safest degree or amount of separation between two points, point a (where i am at) and point b (where it is at).  so this morning, i did my laundry. time just passed me by, as if doing the laundry was no longer a burden, because my boardmate mike, was there, chatting with me. i think he's a good person. i can sense it on the way he talks. he's happy. he's peaceful. he likes living. he likes waking up each morning and knowing that he can learn a lot of things each day. he's at peace in Christ. and i envy him. :( michael is a baptist. richie and michael have been inviting me to go with them this sunday and observe their services. i wish i could but i decided not to. maybe because of the fact that i'm a catholic. and i'm happy to be one. though i'm not really religious, but i embrace my religion. and i'm embracing it real tight.Ü  The gospel today:   As the Father loves me, so I also love you. Remain in my love.  If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love  , just as I have kept my Father's commandments and remain in his love.  I have told you this so that   my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete  .

       My Last Farewell   For now, I just have to quit dating. Sowi... nothing personal but i opt to go on a group date because... kapoy kaayo na nga bisyo! Period.  Omigosh! there has been some updates on blogger! and you can actually add comments. Oh well. That's about it. I'm about to leave from work now. I gotta talk to my landlady when i wake up cuz i was charged P210.00 this month (2 people) for water, considering my mama pays P243.00/month back there in Cagayan (5 people). I think it's too much. So remind me to bring my calculator with me. Alrighty?

      A very nice message from my friend, Cookie:  "Please do not let it ruin you."  "Everything happens for a reason! There will always be light at the end of every tunnel. Believe me. You can surpass this. He is just part of your life who has helped you in ways you cant always see. And now that he is gone, move on."  ~Sigh. Thanks kie.Ü It means so much knowing that you're there for me.Ü  Next stop. I finished reading Tim LaHaye's book today. Like i said, it's about the 4 temperaments (Sanguine, Choleric, Melancholic and Phlegmatic). My boardmate, Michael let me read it and it helped me a lot. In a way, it comforted me. It's actually more about Spirit-filled temperaments. ~Thanks mike! (As if he can read this.) If you'd like to know more about the temperaments.  urlLink Click Here . It's actually different on the link (from what's discussed on the book) because the book primarily entails about what the 4 temperaments are when filled with the Holy Spirit. All in all, it's a must-read book. Oh BTW, i'm a MelPhleg. More of a melancholic than a phlegmatic (80%,20% perhaps). FYI.Ü  Last stop. Ever since High School, my therapeutic activity would be in writing and expressing myself through pen and paper, apparently, up until now, it still is... with this blogspot. mi asylum has given me a source of strength. everywhere i go i always think of what i'm gonna type here. so where am i heading at? sometime ago, i believe i said i will limit what i'm gonna type here. i guess that would no longer be true. considering how much i have shared, both my thoughts and more on how i feel. i can't help it. i really can't help it. it makes me feel a whole lot better evertime i let out a thought or two here. so that's why i opened up the portal of my Open Diary. If you want to stop by, just have an open mind, consider my thoughts and feelings are constantly changing every second.Ü  that's about it. ciao.Ü

      i don't understand why when i get to sit in front of the computer... i become speechless. all those thoughts i had awhile ago, just seem to disappear. not fair... (i like the new look by the way)  first off. let me share to you what happened to me today. i did my laundry. ate brunch. cleaned my room. bathed. ironed my clothes. then i went to ayala. read a book. very nice book actually. it's about the four temperaments. i wish i could tell you all about it but some other time perhaps. i have my own reason why i came online tonight.  now let's go to what i had in mind. cowards, they have their own way of making shit. they have their own way of pleasing themselves, praising themselves, making themselves "look good", and well basically, making some shit... so my point is, you can't tell everybody that she's still in love with you up until this time when you haven't even have her as your girlfriend, and you never did (actually), and you never will... (inhale, exhale) because she doesn't even like you, now that she knows what your true colors are, not even a little tiny bit of your fingernails. so you can't say that just to make you look good you know! cuz my gosh! don't make me say it again... you're a loser! pfffffffft!   "cut!" teehee! let's just say i made that up. or maybe i meant half of that. cuz i'm cwaaazzzzyyyy!!!  i really do have a lot of things to say. actually more about my hurting feelings right now. have i told you i watched van helsing alone today and i remembered watching peter pan with joel in cagayan? and it brought tears to my eyes. and i cried again? no? well, yeah... that's what happened awhile ago... you just don't know how painful it was knowing that he cried on my shoulders... and i cried as well... and we cried together... for an unexplainable reason... you just don't know how painful it was to be left there, alone. just because his real girlfriend was waiting for him outside... and you don't have a choice but to let him go because... both of you are past... and you can't do anything about it. yeah, you just don't know how painful that is...  God,  take this pain away... take this pain away... take this pain away... take this pain away... please...

       Everything Happens For A Reason    Sometimes people come into your life and you  know right away that   they were meant to be  there, to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson,  or to help you figure out who you are or who you  want to become  . You never know who these people  may be (possibly your roommate, neighbor,  coworker, long lost friend, lover, or even a  complete stranger), but when you lock eyes with  them, you know at that very moment they will  affect your life in some profound way.     And sometimes things happen to you that may seem  horrible, painful, and unfair at first, but in  reflection you find that without overcoming  those obstacles you would have never realized your  potential, strength, willpower, or heart  .   Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens  by chance or by means of good luck. Illness,  injury, love, lost moments of true greatness,  and sheer stupidity all occur   to test the limits of  your soul  . Without these small tests, whatever  they may be, life would be like a smoothly  paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. It would be safe  and comfortable, but dull and utterly pointless.   The people you meet who affect your life, and  the success and downfalls you experience,   help to  create who you are and who you become  . Even the  bad experiences can be learned from. In fact,  they are probably the most poignant and  important ones.   If someone hurts you, betrays you, or  breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have  helped you learn about trust and the importance  of being cautious when you open your heart  .   If someone loves you, love them back  unconditionally, not only because they love you,  but because in a way,   they are teaching you to  love and how to open your heart and eyes to  things  . Make every day count Appreciate every  moment and take from those moments everything  that you possibly can for you may never be able  to experience it again.   Talk to people that you have never talked to  before, and actually listen. Let yourself fall  in love, break free, and set your sights high. Hold  your head up because you have every right to.  Tell yourself you are a great individual and  believe in yourself, for   if you don't believe in  yourself, it will be hard for others to believe  in you  .   You can make of your life anything you wish.  Create your own life and then go out and live it  with absolutely no regrets.   Most importantly!!!   If you love someone tell him or her, for you  never know what tomorrow may have in store. And    learn a lesson in life each day that you live  .   That's The Story of Life  Nice noh? I got it from him ->  urlLink unsa gani web address sa imong website?

       Why I Changed My Number   Simple. I wanna cut the line that links us. I have to forget my ex because this is no longer healthy. Like I said, it's giving me eyebugs and I'm getting freakier and freakier everyday. I mean, how could I be soooo stupid? It's a simple logic that I refuse to understand! I have to move on. Period. I should start seeing people differently. I should stop comparing them to my ex. My ex does this, my ex does that. my ex don't do this, my ex don't do that. ek ek ek ek, ek ek ek ek Aaaargh! What a LOSER!  so that's it. i changed my number. because i don't want to be a LOSER. cuz i'm not a LOSER and i will never be a LOSER. cuz my Mama said so!!! :p  loser aside. i stopped by one of my friend's weblog.  urlLink http://www.purgedsoul0110.blogspot.com/  -"ey don!Ü musta u?" seems to me i'm not the only one who feels down once in awhile. we're normal people afterall! so hang in there friend!Ü  dondon aside. this morning i was crying on my bed. loooong story... but yeah i did. (so what?) and gaston was the only person i could talk to regarding the matter. so i texted him. someway somehow he comforted me... he was the one who suggested that i should change my number. cuz the fact that i still have communication with my ex, i could never move on. he even asked me to get a friend to help me get through with this (as if it's that easy!) and to keep on praying cuz it's God's will. i may not understand it but it's His will. and i felt better...Ü

       4 Days Vacation in Cagayan   hi!Ü I just learned sometime ago that OT means "out of topic".Ü  so there's a reason why you are brought to this page.  but i do know that you came here because you want the truth. the whole truth. and nothing but the truth. so help me God!  iniwi, spontaneity. that's my goal today. i just want to write anything that comes across my mind... so right now, just so you will know, i'm pissed! i'm soooo pissed out because i already had this composition! and f**k! the computer restarted without even nudging me and i wasn't able to save it and here i am! i have to write things all over again and it spoiled everything! (OT: our electric fan stand looks like a driving wheel) my main reason why i'm here is to share to you my 4 days vacation in cagayan...Ü  so let me start by telling you a story about a girl... standing in a front of a boy, asking him to love her. familiar?Ü yes my friend. i came back here with a purpose. i came here to make a change. i came here with a specific agenda. i came... sigh. to follow my heart. i came here... hahaaay! to bring him back... yeah, you got me there. i want him back. period. no what ifs. no buts. so zip it! and well of course, i miss my family real bad! i gotta spend time with them!  "i know who i want to take me home! i know who i want to take me home! i know who i want to take me home! take me home! closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end... " -Semisonic  perhaps there are reasons why, maybe... i'm tired of night life. i'm tired of discos. i'm tired of billiards. i'm tired of drinking. i'm tired of dating guys (and i can't force myself to like them anyway).  boils down to the main reason. which is. i'm tired of buying happiness. it's a waste of money. it's a waste of time. it's a waste of effort. it gives me eyes bugs. and it makes me look uglier and uglier and uglier every freaking day. and i'm sick of that. so screw everything! leme come back here... and do my thang.Ü  saturday mission:  i called him up. he's in red ribbon. he's eating there. with somebody. his girlfriend? yes his girlfriend. he's got a girlfriend.  i broke down. i cried. shit. to make the story short. my plan crumbled... so what to do now? i have to get the hellouta my bed!  so my night life started again. i went out to meet some friends in the night cafe... hej, guy1, guy2, guy3 and gaston.Ü  let me tell you what i usually do when i'm in a real deep shit.  "got introduced to you by a friend. and you were cute and all that baby you set the trend yes you did oh. and next thing i know we're down at the cinema, we're sittin' there and you start kissin' me what's that about???" -M2M  i wish!!!Ü sorry po. no kissin...Ü wala lang... naghang out lang mi... they were just friends. so all they did was actually comfort me by listening to my endless incantations, by sitting there and drinking with me. they suggested i should hang myself. or maybe jump off carmen bridge. maybe try to drink some poison. or perhaps slash my wrist. the best suggestion i got was... try all that in one time! coooooooooooooool!Ü but nah.   (OT: nitext sha! his message? "GOD is the reason why... even at the saddest part of life, we SMILE; even in confusion, we UNDERSTAND; even in betrayal, we TRUST; and even in fear of pain, we LOVE.")  i said nah... because i started to like gaston. considering the state that i was in, i should probably brush it away and think of it as a dream? i don't know. really. i won't deny that i easily fall for a guy. but it's different with him because he makes me wanna forget my ex.Ü and any guy can never have that effect on me in one snap! hell, he did. and darn it! he's younger than me! shoot me. shoot me now! i'm sorry- shoot me later. i'm not done yet.  to proceed. i'm not at all worried if ever he'll reach this page... wala man shai friendster. hehehehe! Listen to me talking to myself…  “you shouldn’t fall for him sashi! he only thinks you’re using him because he knows you love your ex and besides you told him yourself that you have that tendency. When you’re heartbroken, you tend to divert your feelings to another person… and what do you think does that say? Eh?”  “I know. I know. I know! It was wrong for me to say that to him. Darn it! But it’s the truth! That’s what usually happens… but I don’t think this is a diversion, maybe a little… because even before, even BEFORE, I like him already. Remember during Joel’s birthday? Remember the time you went to his house? Remember when you ate V-cut with Joel and him in his room? Remember the time when he got his new celfone and you sent him logos? Remember how you feel so happy every time he texts you? And you can’t do anything about it… just because you have a boyfriend. And he’s your boyfriend’s bestfriend… and you don’t want to hurt Joel? Remember all those things?”  “Good point. Yes, I do remember all those things… But what else can you do now? He doesn’t know what’s on your mind at all. And he thinks you’re only using him to mend a broken heart. That could be the reason why he dint text back. The reason why his last message was just that above. The reason why he’s a stone. The reason why he tried not to be affected by you.”  “Yeah, maybe maybe. But I can’t do anything now. I know that. I just wish I could go back and change anything and let things flow ‘normally’… I wish I hadn’t told him that my way of attacking situations like this is to divert my attention to another person. Bad move.”  Anyway, I have to go na. Chatting with baby pawi online.  So NOW, you can shoot me.  ciao friend!

       Hi.   i haven't been here for quite some time now! wow. so much about a busy weekend huh? darn. i got booted out of friendster. ugh.   so anyway i have been thinking... (which is really really really rare by the way...) and it's about destination. i was walking my way up here cuz my hands have been itching, pestering me to stop by a net cafe... well it's those kind of instances wherein your soul went ahead of you already and sat comfortably in front of a computer. i was so immersed thinking about what i'm gonna do, what sites to open, what thoughts to share, what to post, to open friendster, to approve kristine's testimony, to check my emails... then it occurred to me, you'll never know- you'll never know whether or not you will reach your destination. i'm never sure whether or not i could do the things i HAVE BEEN THINKING TO DO. cuz you could die ANYTIME. cuz I could die ANYTIME.  that is, if your destination is very short-sighted. i tell you, never think of short-sighted destinations. don't BE  short-sighted. think that you're made to live eternally. think of destinations beyond human existence. in every LITTLE THING THAT YOU DO NOW, it will VIBRATE on how your eternal life is going to be. what we have now, OUR LIFE is just a milli-micro second of what we're going have when we die, compared to eternal life. that is why we have to think about the things that we're going to say or do now. let us realize that everything around us IS TEMPORARY. we don't belong here. this is NOT OUR WORLD. that is why we feel pain, we feel sadness, we feel we don't belong because we really don't! and that proves everything.  i spent my weekend in shangri la hotel. it was a very very very beautiful place. i like the bed, and the TV most of all, not the pool, nor their bars, nor any of their facilities. i think it's strange because those were the things I HAVE BACK AT HOME. a nice comfortable bed, and a cable TV. what striked me most was that somebody told me "YOU WILL REGRET THIS" after declaring i don't want to go for a swim on the pool. sure i have my swim wear. but i don't FEEL LIKE going for a swim. i want to snuggle behind the covers, and watch some TV. then it gave me another light bulb moment. i looked around me. yes, it was breathtakingly beautiful, the beach, the pool, everything around me. God created such such such wonderful beautiful things... and i ENJOY every minute, every second seeing that. i do, i really do appreciate the beauty that surrounded me. BUT IT'S NOT ALL THERE IS. even if i took that swim, even if i spent that night in their bar (because this is gonna be a one-time experience for me, and i hope not), IT'S NOT ALL THERE IS. i believe, deep in my heart, from the depths of my soul that THERE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PERFECT EXPERIENCE BUT SPENDING IT WITH GOD. sure those earthly things will make me happy, but i'm very positive IT WILL SUBSIDE. so that is why, here on earth? it's okay to say no. it's okay to let that pass.Ü no regrets.  and sometimes i wonder why some people do not enjoy spending time with themselves. sure i enjoy spending time with friends as well. and i love other people's company but there are really times that i want to spend it with myself. ALONE. cuz would you believe? i like talking to myself. reading a good book. i love telling myself (let's say- after seeing a horrible thing) "you know sash, if you think everything around you is beautiful, there are ugly sites as well, and you have to deal with that."Ü   i think i'm boring you now. ciao for now.Ü tata!

       June 16: Cwazy Cwazy Dweam   There was a Pink Party going on and all of us in the account were dancing onstage like crazy. Everybody was having fun. Atoy, our account manager came up to me on the floor and touched my arm and offered me a ride home. And I refused. The next day, I was late in (sort of) a class with the rest of my colleagues. I forgot to login but I eventually did it halfway my shift. Rob was sitting on my chair, so I would have to sit to the chair next to him. He was sitting between me and Ivy.  He made me really angry because he deliberately touched my waist. Chancing kaayo sha! And I gave him a look of disgust at his attitude. He really annoyed me!  Ivy and I were talking in our office canteen and i told her how strange it was that Atoy offered me a ride home, and Ivy agreed because he's not like that with the rest of our colleagues, even to her. I also told her how annoyed i was with Rob. He's so touchy and ew. ew. ew! So we were there chatting... Peering from the outside through the glass window was mungkey. I remembered he wanted something from me sometime before. I did actually left it on his PC, just kind of posted it there (it's sort of a report on pieces of paper) because he wasn't around. Later that time i realized he wasn't able to get it. so i then remembered getting it back because it was left on his PC unmoved. So let's go back to him peering at us from the outside wearing a blue cap his face so close to the window. Later I realized Ivy was outside talking with him.  And then I had a dream about humans turning animals and animals turning humans. Then I remember Ivy, she loves cats and she promised this one cat to sleep with her in our room (and we're not even room mates), but i hate cats. and I insisted that i don't want that cat inside our room. She gave in anyway, when the cat walked away and as Ivy closed the door the cat was looking at me, somehow disappointed at me... then he turned into a human being.  I then remembered that same human turning into another animal and he crossed the carmen river to help two humans on the other side trying to turn off a fire on the hill. The setting was at my home, fisla village. I went my way walking towards my home when i saw another real horses running after fake human horses... Then i remember standing at the back of our old house. a very very big white bird flew in but was trapped because of the trees that i have to held it up high (upside down, his beak facing towards me) so it won't reach the ground, so it won't fall. and it had difficulty in breathing. I breathed on its beak to help him.  And guess what, the bird was not really comfortable with me, i sensed that this was the cat that Ivy likes...  Then there was our work routine, the setting was in an auditorium not in our office. On the corner, math people were having their review for an upcoming examination. I can recall using bangles on our hands instead of raising a flag to call for a supervisor or ask a supervisor a question. I remember Papa and Mungkey at a corner observing somebody taking live calls.

      i read about tesseract yesterday (from hardrocker's site...) it is a 4-dimensional cube. as you know, we live in a 3-dimensional world where there is the x, y, and the z axis (width, length and height). even a very thin piece of paper has thickness... 0.000001 cm something. imagine if we live in a 4-dimensional world, what do you think it would be like? how are we going to do the things we do? interact with the other objects? do you think we could then explain our questions about paranormal phenomena? imagine if there's a portal somewhere at the cornerest corner of this earth where you can slide in to another place having a different dimension, maybe 4, 5, 6, or n-dimensional world! now, imagine if this world is a 2-dimensional world! maybe i can't use the line "ang kapal ng mukha mo!", can i? teehee! and we really don't know, perhaps there are existing planets out there having different dimensions. how about from another galaxy? maybe the creatures living there have different understanding than what we normally understand. different brainwaves that is. i mean, does it matter if they live in a world with different dimensions? do you think it will make them smarter than us? gazillion times smarter? and it would be hard for them to live in a world like ours... because they're not used to it and they'd DIE??? and if we live in their n-dimensional world, we'd also DIE???? and EVERYBODY DIES if we criss cross worlds with them??? do you think it's a great adventure if INDEED THERE IS SUCH A PORTAL? do you think it would be a nice idea to have one scientist invent a machine that opens up a portal for at least one of these worlds? IF (pause) THEY EXIST... so then i could use you for a lab rat and test the theory... do you think it's possible i could be THAT SCIENTIST? no? well why not?!!! do you think i'm not capable enough??? yes?  ugh.  PS. this is where i read about tesseract:  urlLink hardrocker's archive

       Pisces   The horrible earthborn giant Typhoeus suddenly appeared one day, startling all the gods into taking on different forms to flee. Venus and her son Cupid were bathing on the banks of the Euphrates River that day, and took on the shapes of a pair of fish to escape danger.   i'm bored. super bored, A+++++++. and i still have 7 more hours to go... tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock. today is our Account Manager's birthday.  urlLink Remember him?  Yeah, it's his birthday today... AND OH MY GOSH!!! I almost forgot, It's also my brother's birthday today!!! June 14!  "Ha P Birthday 2u! Ha P Birthday 2u! Ha P Birthday, Ha P Birthday! Ha P Birthday 2Phrbs! How old are yoooou...?!!"  I hope you got my present. I used the carrier: Cookie. Very fast and reliable.Ü Darn... i wish i could be home, last year i wasn't home on his birthday too. because I WAS HERE. I've been living in Cebu for more than a year now! How great is that?   now you sit there. sit! sit! sit! i wanna see you sitting there... ~who sashi? who? weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh!!! i'm so bored, bored bored bored... researching for a nice song, from the movie Mac&Me. Hold that thought!  "Take Me, I'll Follow" (This is my teamsong with my friend, Enen, who's so far far away)  Tired of feeling all by myself Being so different From everyone else Somehow you knew I needed your help Be my friend forever  I never found My star in the night Feeling my dream was Far from my sight You came along and I saw the light We'll be friends forever  CHORUS: I can't face the Thought of you leaving So take me along I swear I'll be strong (If/when) you take me Wherever you go I wanna learn the things That you know Now that you Made me believe I want you to take me 'Cause I long to be able To see the things That you see know that whatever you do I'll follow you  Somebody must have Sent you to me What do I have You could possibly need All I can give is my guarantee We'll be friends forever  Repeat chorus  Teach me more in Each passing hour By your side I know I will cower Is it true that You have the power To capture this moment in time  Take me wherever you go I wanna learn the things That you know Now that you made me believe I want you to take me 'Cause I long to be able To see the things That you see Know that Whatever you do I'll follow you (Repeat)  Now let go of that thought! Hold this thought instead: A you're adorable, B you're so beautiful, C you're so (bleet!)... EXIT, somewhere near the first floor pantry...  Over and out.Ü

       what about my rest days?   waiting for my two days off was a much awaited opportunity for me to spend time with myself. i was very very excited because i miss malling and watching movies. i miss eating at a fastfood and reading a good book. i miss doing the things that i usually do. i just miss my company. i miss sashi.   so finally, i savored spending time with myself. last friday i watched Shrek 2. it was a really funny movie. i watched it 2 times, i would have watched it 3 or 4 times more hadn't i promised cookie i'll be in our BH around 5:30pm. i like the choices of words in the movie. and mostly i like the humor. no corny jokes. they have scenes that can really make you "laugh". bottom line, it's the writer that i give my credits to. it's ALWAYS the writer for me.Ü  so during the 2nd round of shrek2, i had the sudden curiousness to ask dennis, "is joel aware that you have my new number?" and then the revelations...  He gave him my new number. Joel was asking him a lot of things about me and he's just being careful kay basin unsai mahuna hunaan ni Joel about sa amo. which i personally think is no longer important. i mean i don't care what he thinks about us. it doesn't matter. does it? what i don't understand is... it was dennis' idea to change my number because it could help me move on. and now, he gave him my number. what's his point? perhaps he's on joel's side because he's been friends with him longer than i am? ugh. i'm not even sure if that would matter as well... i don't know. i still think it wasn't fair. sigh. oh well! so much about friends... so anyway, he admitted that it was his mistake for making that suggestion (having me change my number) and he reasoned that no problem will be solved if we evade from it, we should face it because it's the truth. he added also na gaselos na si joel namo kay cge mi gatext. again, so what? and dili man sad jud mi permi gatext... and let me add a few points here. not all problems can be solved by facing it. SOMETIMES EVASION IS THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. think about that.  good thing is. joel IS cooperative. maybe he realized i am willing to move on without him. cuz i dint receive any missed call nor text from him. so you can give me your pat. pat. pat. and tell me "you're doing good. keep it up! just hang in there!"  grrr. ex topics again. for the past few days, i've been dreaming of catching up something, and getting late to work, and worrying. and it never ends... and i never reached the point whether or not i was able to catch up or was able to settle it. it seems to me like it's something in the future and the future alone. as if i can't be there that's why my dream dint allow me to reach that point... and i dint know what happened next. it's really weird because three times i dreamt similar dreams. and i wonder what that could mean. is it a warning? does it involve my future? is it something to do with making big decisions? hu-what does that mean?  yesterday i watched the confessions of a teenage drama queen. there's nothing exceptional on the movie. just pretty faces and cute dance steps. that's all. enough for now.  ciao.Ü

      my phone has personalized message alerts. a unique tone for my family, one for dennis and another for everybody else. i was on my way home from work when i heard my phone's message tone. very rare tone. even if i knew who it was, i still doubted. who else? him.Ü well, it's nothing exceptional... but it's actually something i can consider as one of the highlights of my week. here's how our text messaging script went:  Caution: Vernacular language used.  "sash regardz daw joel imo."  "Ah wai klaro ui. Magpadumdum man.."  "Hehe dapat ready ka sa tanan... meaning cya pa gyapon diay kay dili man malimtan. Hahaha"  "Either way, mao man japon imong esulti nako... Mu react ko or dili, muingon man japon ka na wa japon sha nako nalimtan. Pero gilang someday makaingon ra jud ka na gina mean nko ako sulti.Ü"  "Ngee ang ako lang dapat ready ka sa tanan, ready ka muatubang sa iya. Kung storyahan lang gani mahadlok naka madumduman..."  "Good point. Oo na lagi! Kanunayng ready na jud diay akong show ron....Ü"  "Hoist basin nakadisturbo ko ha? Nagwork ka ron? Unsa na man standing life diha? Share sad oi..."  "K ra ui.Ü Night time para sa ako ron.Ü 11pm-7am akong duty, karon pako katugpa, ayha pa pud ko matulog. Okay lang japon ko, naa na koi roomate, her name is cookie. So medyo dili na kau mingaw 4 me. *this part censored*. Si Hegi, okay lang japon, gaadjust pa. How about you?"  "Ako okay lang. Si joel regardz daw cya ug ga adjust. Hehe cge tulog na ui... maluoy sad ta."  "Wapak! Regards pud dw imong ex! :p Cge, gnyt!ÜÜ"  "Okay, sleep well, don't think of joel ha?hehe"  so that's about it. ey, here's something I stole somewhere (from friendster btw):  HE: Can I buy you a drink?  SHE: Actually I'd rather have the money.  HE: I'm a photographer. I've been looking for a face like yours.  SHE: I'm a plastic surgeon. I've been looking for a face like yours.  HE: Hi. Didn't we go on a date once? Or was it twice?  SHE: Must've been once. I never make the same mistake twice.  HE: How did you get to be so beautiful?  SHE: I must've been given your share. HE: Will you go out with me this Saturday?  SHE: Sorry. I'm having a headache this weekend.  HE: Your face must turn a few heads.  SHE: And your face must turn a few stomachs.  HE: Go on, don't be shy. Ask me out.  SHE: Okay, get out.  HE: I think I could make you very happy.  SHE: Why? Are you leaving?  HE: What would you say if I asked you to marry me?  SHE: Nothing. I can't talk and laugh at the same time.  HE: Can I have your name?  SHE: Why? Don't you already have one? HE: Shall we go see a movie?  SHE: I've already seen it.  HE: Where have you been all my life?  SHE: Hiding from you. HE: Haven't I seen you some place before?  SHE: Yes. That's why I don't go there anymore.  HE: Is this seat empty?  SHE: Yes, and this one will be if you sit down.  HE: So, what do you do for a living?  SHE: I'm a female impersonator.  HE: Hey baby, what's your sign?  SHE: Do not enter. HE: Your body is like a temple.  SHE: Sorry, there are no services today. HE: If I could see you naked, I'd die happy.  SHE: If I saw you naked, I'd probably die laughing.  HE: Where have you been all my life?  SHE: Where I'll be the rest of your life - in your wildest dreams.

      today is not my day. almost all calls were messed up. i know why, because i dint started it right. i wanted to be at work at least 45 minutes earlier. that way, i could do my research first, and organize all my stuffs. but today i arrived 15 minutes before. my bad. oh well. so much about larshans(?)...  oh. dennis texted me yesterday!ÜÜÜÜ actually, i sent my bestfriend, joey a forwarded message, and then she sent me back another forwarded message that goes like this... "sometimes friends are separated by priorities, by distance, by differences and pride, but no matter how far and different we are, i'll always be the friend you've known from the very start.Ü" funny... you know why? because i:  ~was half asleep when i read that message, and  ~was half asleep when i forwarded that to him, and  ~was half asleep when i got his reply that says, "Hi sash, musta?" and  ~was half asleep while i texted him a reply, "Okay lng jpn.Ü"... then  ~was full asleep right when i was about to send it to him...  ~zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...  so when i woke up... i accidentally pressed the YES button and sent my message to him... darn, i dont want to send him a short message... sigh. nothing more that i could do. huh? oh well! that's about it.   My Sassy Girl   About the Movie: "The essence of the film involves the interactions between college student Kyun-woo (Tae-hyun Cha) and a nameless, beautiful girl (Ji-hyun Jun) that he encounters at the train station one night. She’s drunk beyond belief, and Kyun-woo at first saves her from being crushed by an oncoming train. Then, during the subsequent train ride, he ends up being forced to take charge of this inebriated woman - as her last act before passing out cold is to look at the hapless bystander and mutter "Honey!", leading all the other passengers in the train to believe that she is Kyun-woo’s girlfriend. Initially, he tries to simply abandon the unconscious girl in the train station, but his conscience gets the best of him and he decides instead to take her to a hotel where she can recover. From there the machinations unfurl, with Kyun-woo watching his world go awry as he tries to come to terms with this strange young woman. She is bossy, curt and given to violent outbursts directed towards either the poor protagonist himself or random strangers who offend her sensibilities in some way. But beneath the harsh exterior of this seeming sociopath there appears to lurk a vulnerable soul, and Kyun-woo finds himself drawn to her and eventually hopes that he can somehow heal her desperate inner sorrow."

      the first day after one year:  my topic tonight will no longer be about "boring stuffs" a.k.a. joel. i'd like to talk about... er... "more boring stuffs" a.k.a. sashi...   so i slept the whole day today, let me tell you about the dream that i just had this morning.  i dreamt of gian. i was standing outside an auditorium, 3rd floor. i can remember it clearly it's the auditorium of Liceo De Cagayan back in my hometown... now the weird thing is gian was standing at the mouth of CIT building, an infrastructure of MY school, XU Ateneo de Cagayan... It's weird because the two buildings were standing adjacent to each other. but dreams are really like that. So anyway, I was looking at him on the big window from where i am at. and he was staring at me. even at a distance, i could tell the expression on his face that says, "isn't that sashi?"... i can understand why, because it has been quite some time now that he hasn't seen me. so what i did was, since i felt uncomfortable being stared at, i tried to look away while i clamped up my hair, but when i looked back at him, he was still looking at me... with the same expression on his face...  we had a role play going on in that auditorium... i can still remember it perfectly that i was the presiding priest... and the closest sacrament that we're about to present is the holy matrimony. when our presentation was over and we were on our way out the auditorium. i saw gian coming in... i was carrying the bible in front of me but sideways, and he said, that's not the way a priest should carry the bible. he told me it should be in front of me and not sideways. so i did that as i made my way outside. then i held his hand, it's skinny and a little rough... we were about to leave that place but my phone's alarm sounded. it's 11 am, and i still have to iron my clothes.  what a very strange dream. so anyway, try checking out what that dream meant:  Dr. Float's Dream Interpretation   A school is a place to learn. This is where the dreamer can recount his past experiences.   Looking out a window in a dream symbolizes an outlook at someone's dream. It poses sort of like an overview.   Dreaming of a priest can symbolize the need for spiritual guidance or advice.

      this morning, right when i got off work. i stopped by my church to attend mass. before it started, there's this man who walked up in front, and said "June 6, 2004" then started to chant kilometric announcements, activities in the future, choo choo choo... have you ever felt this feeling? -i was staring at this guy... everything around me was moving so slow, and the only sound that my ears chose to listen to was echoing "June 6, 2004", over and over and over again. this date was so striking to me, i can't explain why... but then i remembered...  it has been a year already...  here's something i wrote in 'mi asylum':  "September 6, 2003 Haven't been here for a long time... waz frustrated over my asylum version 2, cuz i can't find any site that hosts free php webspace... grrrr... so anyway, right now, i'm in MIX Ramos... im using the Php20/hr internet here... chatting with madzky... nothing much happened really... quick updates: had a break up. laughed. laughed. laughed. cried (ssh!). new life. new job. new friends. new people around me... still alive and kickin'... 9 more months to go... i'll be single for ONE whole year!!!! hell yeah!!! celebrate good times, come on!!! Austin: 'Yeah baby!'"  yes, i'm already one year single. yet i'm not sure if it's something i should celebrate about, very unlikely... so ummm... yipeee???   i can still remember it clearly, i asked myself... "where will i be on june 6, 2004?", it was a future for me then, it is a present to me now. and basing on my blog rantings, there's no reason for me to celebrate this day. and there's no reason for me to mourn as well. but, but, BUT. let this day be a special day for me. because this day, marked what happened to me last june 6, 2003:  i was on my way to my boarding house, i just came from the 5:30pm mass of sto. rosario church. i was upset because joel dint text, call, or even tried to contact me that day. and it was supposedly our 2 years and 7th monthsary... i never tried to even understand his side. at that time, he had no celphone and no money. so how else could he get in touch with me? little did i know that he tried to earn enough money so he could call me. little did i know that he went out on that rainy day to borrow a celphone, to buy a card, so he could call me. and finally when he did... i was so upset. i was so angry at him. and pushed him away. i pushed him to his limit. his anger exploded. and finally told me that he's giving up. i was too much for him. he couldn't handle me because i was soooo demanding and i never even tried to consider his side. he tried to explain but i wouldn't even listen. he told me we have to break up... and he ended it... his loss at that time dint have any effect on me yet. i thought i was strong. and i can take that.   i remember when i was still in cagayan, we used to be in and out of our relationship for like an hour span cuz we can't bear not talking to each other. we usually talk things out and settle things, so at the least time we're at war and the next hour, we're all good. so anyway, i really don't know why i was so firm at that time, perhaps God had a reason of providing me that strength... joel tried all efforts to get back with me. he came to cebu and he really wanted to see me, but i spared not even a single second of my time with him. i was so mean. and others defined it as being strong, maybe... i don't really know. even when i got back home in cagayan... he still wanted me back... but it was i who made a decision that it was over... so that was what happened and that was the only reason why we broke up. because i failed to see his side. i was selfish. my parents never really liked him, maybe my mama. cuz joel is a good guy and my mama knows that what joel feels for me is true. she saw all the flowers that joel sent me, she saw all the cards, and she witnessed all the wonderful things that joel did just for me. mama knows all that. but well, since joel is still in school, she's really not on his side, perhaps only when he's done with his school, i guess. as for my relatives, they thought it was gonna be me and him for the rest of our lives, but nope they were wrong... and they din't really like him as the rest-of-my-life partner because they think we're 2 completely different people. so when we broke up they rejoiced. sigh. oh well... funny, ex topics are really good blog-rants.ÜÜÜÜ  so now at present, here i am working. i spent my june 6, 2004 sleeping. played text twist on a palm. hugged my fluffy pillow... i have a different life now. a life without joel. and i have to deal with that. because there's really nothing i can do about it. he has his own life too. he has his own choices. the only reason why i had a firm decision last year... was because... i want him to become a better person, to GROW WITHOUT ME, TO BE STRONG, TO NOT BE TOO DEPENDENT, TO MAKE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS, CUZ LIFE IS WHAT HE MAKES IT... i THOUGHT he'd choose MY CHOICE for HIS LIFE, for HIS FUTURE, but i was wrong. he opted to go on the other direction...  i know he had said hurtful things against me during our breakup... but i never told you how many disparaging, unfavorable judgment words i have uttered to put him down, and generally belittle him, and make him feel bad about himself... just to make me feel better... just to cover up my pain, just to make me feel okay... i never told you that. so that is why you would never understand, NEVER, why i can't move on. it's because there was no reasonable cause of our breakup. everything he did, he had done because he loves me. period. sniffff. :( i don't really want to cry in front of this damn computer. i have to go.  So anyway, i know this is gonna be posted on june 7, 2004 *it's 1:17 am*, it's okay... i just want to post something out here. maybe for the last time. it's just me and joel, and how we used to be...Ü       ciao for now.Ü

      so right now i'm kinda bored. i regretted doing something today. let's just say, a friend asked me to give her ex a ring using my phone. and i did. in turn, i asked her to give my ex a ring on her phone. which obviously, i shouldn't have. there was actually no ring on his phone when we tried it the 1st and 2nd time (i thought it was really really really over. period. PLUS period.), but then when we tried it the 3rd time, it rang... and i realized, damn. i can't believe i'm NOT doing any therapy at all! i'm just too weak to resist the temptation of knowing whether or not he's alive, whether or not his number is still reachable. yep, i shouldn't have asked her to do it for me. damn it was a mistake doing that. aaaargh! i have to keep reminding myself that it's over, over, over, OVER! and if dennis knows about this... it's a SHAAAAME! grrrr. it's a shame because whenever he's around (dennis that is) i always have a firm conviction that i will never ever -even think about joel! but i still do, now that dennis rarely texts me. sigh. oh well. so much about diversion.  so anyway, today, i went to SM with Cookie and watched Harry Potter. I'm not really much of a fan, but i have watched all Harry Potter movies released. i never read the book and am not familiar with all the characters nor the details of the story. so at the end of the movie, i'm just wondering, whatever happened to peter pettigrew? and why sirius black wanted to kill harry on their first encounter. but as the movie progresses, they became friends. oh well. all in all, i like the movie. because harry is cute.Ü he's a 'half-blood' wizard, born July 31st 1980, one year older than meeeeh! and he's good. and young... and i wanna corrupt his innocence!ÜÜÜÜ so anyway, let's get back to... harry.Ü try checking out his get up. i like his clothes, his shoes, his shirt and jeans. if we could go back to the time when i was in high school, i have probably created my own version of harry potter. where i can be the good, powerful sorceress of the east that harry james potter is madly in love with. bwehehehe! huwhy not?! then he'll elope with me and we will rule the world!!!Ü so okay... i got carried away... it's just nice using my imagination to the hilt... so have the patience to endure the rumblings of a demented...  ****to be continued.

      Gana-haaaaaaaan kau kos among AM! Ay-dooooooool kau nako sha!Ü Teehee!  Admiration aside, my perfect definition of LOVE:  If I speak in tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give up all I possess and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.  Love is patient; love is kind; it does not envy; it does not boast; it is not proud. It is not rude; it is not self-seeking; it is not easily angered; it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.  Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will pass away; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.   When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. Now we see but a poor reflection, then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.   And now these three remain: faith, hope and love, but the greatest of these is love.  - I Corinthians, Chapter 13

       Who's Charlie Brown?   Everyone has a personality of a cartoon character. Have you ever asked yourself what cartoon character do you most resemble? A group of investigators got together and analyzed the personalities of well known and modern cartoon characters.   The information that was gathered was made into a test, and from this test, I got 39 points.  (35-42 points) You are Charlie Brown: you are tender, you fall in love quickly but you are also very serious about all relationships. You are a family person. You call your mom every Sunday. You have many friends and may occasionally forget a few Birthdays. Don't let your passion confuse you with reality.   If you want me to email you the test, just leave your address.Ü Ciao.

      A friend of mine, Clint, sent me this forwarded email. It's nice!  When you are together with that special someone, you pretend to ignore that person. But when that special someone is not around, you might look around to find them. At that moment, you are in love.   ~if i got a crush on a certain person, i have the tendency to ignore him, yet i always wish he's around where i can see him. but i don't think i'm in love with him.   Although there is someone else who always makes you laugh, your eyes and attention might go only to that special someone. Then, you are in love.   ~that is true, but i don't think i'm in love with that person.   Although that special someone was supposed to have called you long back, to let you know of their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are desperately waiting for the call! At that moment, you are in love.  If you are much more excited for one! short e-mail from that special someone than other many long e-mails, you are in love.  ~i'm always on watch for the text message of Dennis, maybe hoping he'd email me too cuz he got my email address, but i don't think i'm in love with him.   When you find yourself as one who cannot erase all the messages in your answering machine because of one message from that special someone, you are in love.  ~i can't erase Dennis' text messages, but i don't think i'm in love with him.   When you get a couple of free movie tickets, you would not hesitate to think of that special someone. Then, you are in love.  ~yes i got 3 free movie tickets here with me right now, i can only make we wish i could go home in cagayan so i can share this with him.   You keep telling yourself, "that special someone is just a friend", but you realize that you can not avoid that person's special attraction. At that moment, you are in love.  ~he's just a friend, and i'm attracted to him, but i don't think i'm in love with him.   While you are reading this page, if someone appears in your mind, then u are in love with that person.  ~he appeared on my mind, from the very start, but i don't think i'm in love with him.Ü  ~Everything below this line, i agree.   Imagine...  There is a bank that credits your account each morning with $86,400. It carries over no balance from day to day. Every evening deletes whatever part of the balance you failed to use during the day. What would you do? Draw out ALL OF IT, of course!!!!   Each of us has such a bank. Its name is TIME. Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds.  Every night it writes off, as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to good purpose.  It carries over no balance. It allows no overdraft.   Each day it opens a new account for you. Each night it burns the remains of the day. If you fail to use the day's deposits, the loss is yours.   There is no going back. There is no drawing against the "tomorrow." You must live in the present on today's  deposits. Invest it so as to get from it the utmost in health, happiness, and success! The clock is running. Make the most of today.   To realize the value of ONE YEAR, ask a student who failed a grade.   To realize the value of ONE MONTH, ask a mother who gave birth to a premature baby.   To realize the value of ONE WEEK, ask the editor of a weekly newspaper.   To realize the value of ONE HOUR, ask the lovers who are waiting to meet.   To realize the value of ONE MINUTE, ask a person who missed the train.   To realize the value of ONE-SECOND, ask a person who just avoided an accident.   To realize the value of ONE MILLISECOND, ask the person who won a silver medal in the Olympics.   Treasure every moment that you have! And treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time.   And remember that time waits for no one. Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That's why it's called the present!  Friends are a very rare jewel, indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to succeed.  They lend an ear, they share a word of praise, and they always want to open their heart to us.

      I forgot that pretending to be happy doesn't make you happy. And that pretending to be smart doesn't make you smart. I forgot that you can't just forget the past in fear of the FUTURE. I forgot that you can't control falling in love. And that you can't make yourself fall in love. I learned that I can LOVE. I learned that it's okay to mess up. And it's okay to ask for HELP! And it's okay to feel like crap. I learned it's okay to complain and whine to all your friends for a whole day. I learned that sometimes the things you want most you just can't have and the things that  you look for are right in front of you. I learned that the greatest thing about High School and College and the working world isn't about the parties or the drinking or the hookups... It's the friendships, which means taking chances. I learned that sometimes the things we want to forget are the things which we most need to talk about... I learned that TIME and LOVE can heal all things... I learned that just when you think it can't get worse - it does! but with the love and support of friends - you survive. I've learned that when you start feeling bad about losing touch and about those that you've lost, they too, are feeling the same way. I learned that letters from friends are the most important things. and that sending cards to your friends makes you feel better! But, basically, I just learned that my friends, both old and new, are the most important people to me in the world AND without them, I wouldn't be who I am today... So this is a THANK YOU to all of my friends for always being there.

       Dennis    I don't know- I don't understand THE REASON why he has been ignoring my text messages... not only while I was in Cagayan, but also way back when I was still here in Cebu.   Sure, I CAN understand his side. I know I LIED to him. I told him I WILL MOVE ON... I WILL FORGET my Ex. That I WILL PROVE to HIM AND EVERYBODY else that I'm strong and I'M NOT GOING BACK. YES, I told him all that... plus more of the assurances and RE-assurances. I even asked him to tell my Ex to move on, to forget me... that me and him is no longer possible... blah blah blah...   So we can't blame him right? Right. But what I don't understand is He can't IGNORE ME forever. It's not like he has never been through my situation. I admire him though for being FIRM while I'm NOT. And I can't expect him to "relate" or even "understand" me if he doesn't want to. It's just that, I really DON'T WANT TO LOSE A FRIEND LIKE HIM. He's waaaay too cool and waaaay too nice. And I find comfort in him... I can't bear knowing he's been ignoring me because of Joel... I just can't!   It started when I decided to give Joel another chance but he has to start from the very beginning. I never told Dennis about that. And Joel probably has...   I never saw him nor Joel while I was in Cagayan... and I have to be honest. I felt empty going back here not seeing my Ex... It's the first time.. and Dennis can't blame me for feeling that way. Maybe I can't UNDO the things I've said to him but I really don't know how to settle this. I don't know what to text him. I don't know what to say to him.   Urrrgh! Why is that even important.   Dennis aside... Like I said, I'm gonna spend my time with my family. and I did.   My mama and I went to the parlor last saturday; she had her hair done, and mine too.   On the sunday, we went to MAPAWA NATURE PARK for a swim. I had the chance to be suspended in the air, around 2 meters above the ground, for 8-10 seconds. My brother went horsebackriding. Good for him. I got pretty tired, so I didn't took the chance, I will have mine soon.   Last Monday- MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! I opened my Time Deposit account. Yipeey! With a bigger interest rate, so all I have to do is to set back and relax while it grows and grows and grows... Then with my papa- I bought my ticket, pasalubongs, some breads and pastries. We played one round of Bingo while waiting for Ryan to fetch us... stopped by for a Lechon Manok (for lunch- yumyum!) then we went home.   That's about it.   Over and out!Ü

       Dilemma.    *covers face and sighs* yes, it's looking at me like i'm a prey ready to be slaughtered. *leans back and looks up the ceiling* your friend asked you to watch a movie with him... so what's your plan sash? you mentioned sometime&nbsp;ago that you won't be going out on a date. or maybe not just yet... but&nbsp;do you think it's about time that you do? sash, for crying out loud! get over him! he knows you're giving him a chance&nbsp;and he knows&nbsp;he has to start from the very beginning...&nbsp;but did he&nbsp;EVER make&nbsp;a move?&nbsp;no. did he text you? no. did he call you?&nbsp;no. of course, you gave him the username and password but he didn't check the emails you sent him. did he? no. did he even AT LEAST send you a snail mail? no. he didn't even TRIED to get in touch with you. correct? well... uh, yeah. so stop THINKING he still feels the same way you do. because obviously, he don't. so pick yourself up and move on!!! smart people always have a good head&nbsp;on their shoulders. so let yours be.&nbsp;*sits up and stretches*&nbsp;yeah... maybe it's time i should see some old friends. i think you should too. when you get&nbsp;back&nbsp;here&nbsp;from cagayan, "take a risk. life is what you make it" (isn't this your motto???)- and like what heji said, life is not a race... pat. pat. pat. you're doing good. if you need me. i'm just an internet away...   heehee! hyeah... i talk to myself...   iniwi, i'm done talking with her. now let's get back to you. *squints* uh, nevar mind...   i'm outie.

I know he'll love it.Ü &nbsp; "Advance Happy Birthday Pa!"Ü &nbsp; and it's their WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. So&nbsp;I'm gonna &nbsp;give them the   Sheerly Elegant Cocktail Stemware and the Beverage Shaker  . You ask, what are those? PLASTICS. It's what those are. But I think they are B-U-T-ful, they look like wine glasses. I know they'll love it as well.Ü &nbsp; "Advance Happy Anniversary Pa, Ma!"Ü &nbsp; I'm super excited! I'll be going home this weekend... I told&nbsp;them I'LL STAY HOME EVERY NIGHT during my stay there. Two reasons:  &nbsp; 1. I MISS spending time with them. 2. I don't have money for&nbsp;gasoline.  &nbsp; Argh. Well I saved.&nbsp;I spent&nbsp;for my groceries, BH rent, boat ticket,&nbsp;&nbsp;2 prepaid cards (one for me and one for me), bought Papa's gift, etc. etc. and etc. Expenses, expenses, expenses. So now... I'm downright poor... YETTTT I know I WILL BE&nbsp;HAPPY because I could spend it with my family!!! *dances and wriggles* Even If I have (money), I decided to spend my entire stay there with them. We'll be going to the beach this Saturday!ÜÜÜÜ &nbsp; And I'm happy as a... happy sashi.

       THE ART OF LETTING GO   *char mode- ÜÜÜÜ* &nbsp; It's over. That person is gone. &nbsp;   Why do we have to part while the love is still there?    Why do we have to suffer?  Why do we have to cry when somebody bids goodbye?  Why do beginnings have an end?    Why do we have to meet only to lose in the end?   &nbsp; &nbsp; There are questions left unanswered, words left unsaid, letters left unread, poems left undone, songs left unsung, love left unexpressed, promises left unfulfilled. &nbsp; &nbsp; In a relationship, one of the hardest things to do is saying goodbye and letting go. It is as hard as breaking a crystal because you'll never know when you will be able to pick up the pieces again. More often than not, they who go feel not the pain of parting:   it is they who stay behind that suffer, because they are left with memories of a love that was meant to be, a love that was  . &nbsp; &nbsp; At the beginning and at the end of a relationship, we are embarrassed to find ourselves alone. Unfair as it may seem, but that's the way love goes. That's the drama, the bittersweet and the risk of falling in love. After all,   nothing is constant but change  . Everything will eventually come to its end without us knowing when, without us knowing how, without us even knowing why.   In letting go, sorrows come not as a single spy but in battalion. It seems that   everywhere you go, everything you do, every song you hear  , every turn of your head, every move of your body, every beat of your heart, every blink of your eye and every breath you take always reminds you of him. It's like a stab of a knife, a torture in the night. Funny how the whole world becomes depopulated when only one person is missing. Just imagine, there are billion people on earth and yet it seems you feel lonely and empty without the other. &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know if it's worth calling an art, but letting go entails special skills sparkled with a considerable space and time.   Time heals all wounds but it takes a little push on our part. Acceptance plays a part.   Not all love stories end with "...and they live happily ever after." &nbsp; &nbsp;   Sometimes we have to part because of circumstances beyond our control. We have to suffer if it would mean happiness for others. We have to cry to temporarily let go of the pains. Every beginning has its end like every dawn has its dusk. It's something we can't control, something we had to live up. &nbsp;   &nbsp; It's over. That person's gone. But   life has to go on. Goodbye doesn't always mean forever.   There will always be a place and time where questions will be answered, words will be spoken, letters will be read, poems will be recited in the night, songs will be sung in harmony, love will be expressed in solitude and promises will be fulfilled.     Somewhere. Somehow. Someday.

       I'M BACKKKK!!!    so what's the reason for my silence? nothing- nothing exceptional happened... no feelings to air out. no anger to express. everything is just too ordinary lately... i don't even have any highlights for the week...   i watched KING ARTHUR. i really like the movie. it's the King Arthur tale 1000 years BEFORE it was supposed to have happened. it makes me wonder why so many people doesn't appreciate this movie. they don't really like it- oh well! everybody is entitled to like whatever they like and don't like whatever they don't really like... in my case, i like it. in fact, i LOVE IT. regardless of what they think of the movie. i have read reviews and so far i haven't read... at least... a nice one. but that's okay, my choices make me "rare". anyway, what i like most from the movie is Arthur's principles... equality combined with faith. so mau ra na sha.   in short, it's better than KILL BILL Vol.2.   oh by the way. i know why they're disappointed... because it has a different story from what was found in the book and other offline or online resources... that's why. well, like it said- "it's the King Arthur tale 1000 years BEFORE it was supposed to have happened". kinda different. so get a grip.

      i'm going home! from july 24-26, 3 straight days! (pause) *sighs and lumps back to her seat* but i'm confused. i don't know what to do, as if a part of me wants to go back there, and another part of me, doesn't- i don't want to remember some memories from the past. cuz if i go back there, there's a big possibility that joel and i will be back again. and somehow there's a part of me, a big part of me that says, "I DON'T WANNA GO BACK!!!", my brain. yet, another part of me, also a big part says, "WHAT YOU HAVE WITH HIM IS PRECIOUS, DON'T LET GO!!!", and yes that would be, my heart.  *looks away from the computer and stares blankly on the floor* (pause) *looks at you* (pause) *then looks back on the computer*  clicked "Publish Post" button.

      some things makes me cry...  sportsmanship. team striving to win a competition. the of a every team member. victory.  and i wonder why these things make me cry. it could be my past life. which could be some time in the king arthur era. somebody special could have been involved in a combat. and i was one of the spectators. and he lost and he died. and i was left in pain...  iniwi, here's the link to king arthur's story:  urlLink http://camelot.celtic-twilight.com/pyle_ka/kaprologue.htm   bah?  that aside, i had a chitchat with my landlady yesterday morning. she thinks michael likes me. huh? i don't think so. he's just being extra nice.Ü though i find it strange that he bought me a milk (in nestle tetra pack) last night... oh well.  i'm not done with my letter yet. i don't know where to begin with.

      i dreaded that this day would come. joel finally called me. and he's talking to me as if his call is never a big deal. it is a big deal to me!  and it hurts to know that i'm still part of his plan. that he still wants me to be with him in the future. he called because he's working on his papers to work in brunei. he called just to tell me i'm still on his mind and kuhaon daw ko niya kung okay iyang trabaho didto. it's breaking my heart hearing him say that.   and do you know what i did??? i cried. and i told him. please. stop. and he asked, you don't want me to call you anymore? and i can't answer, cuz i don't know what to say. but i just cried. until he hang up. and i text him i'm sorry for crying over the phone. and until now, i can't contact him...:(  i called my brother ryan. cuz he mentioned nagsabay daw sila ni joel and his barkada nag inom. my brother mentioned 2 specific things. everytime joel hears "the reason", it reminds him of me, and even watching the climax of spiderman, joel went out to follow a girl whom he thought was me... i'm still on his mind.  now i'm confused. again. i should talk with my mama about this. i need somebody who could help me make a good decision. cuz this is draining me. and i don't know what to do anymore. call me a no-brainer. i don't care.   The Reason   Hoobastank     I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you

       Another Date      "Tart, I'm in Golden Peak. Room 1818. I'll be available after 5pm. Kitakits?Ü"  He texted.   "Okidoki!Ü Sulongon taka mga 6pm..."  I replied.  That's how our text messaging went... Eveytime he's here,   he always spends time with me.   Because   my mama doesn't want me to be lonely   and she sends him her kisses for me. He'll be here in Cebu until the Saturday. That means   we have ample time to hang out with each other.   Wow. And he's single, has a stable job, super smart, very responsible and engineer pa jud! But since he's a very busy guy (he was in a Company Seminar), I had to cancel going to the hotel and see him in Ayala instead.   He took me out for dinner.   All expenses paid by him, and just like any regular dates that we had, we catched up on each other's lives.  So right after dinner, we went to KFC to buy some midnight snacks for his officemates. Around 9pm, I asked him to take me to my boarding house early as I still have to work 7am. And he has to work early the next day too. So my date with him was okay-   I had fun  .  Let me tell you about Tart. His name is Bryant. I call him Tartbry. And he calls me Tartshi. Sweet huh? OF COURSE. I like being with him because:   First  , he's smart.   Second  , he has high ideals.   Third  , his plans are goal-oriented and he makes sure they are beneficial in the future.   Fourth  , he ALWAYS makes me feel good about myself.   Fifth  , he's a very good conversationalist.   Sixth  , my parents consider him as their son too. I could go on and on and on...  Yes,   he's ALL THAT  .  And he's just my cousin. No biggie!Ü  He's proud that   I'M HIS   cousin but I'm 100x more- oh so proud that   HE'S MINE  ! BIG HUG to Tarbry!Ü  He looks like this:

       Introduction:       A girl asked a guy if he thought she was pretty. He said no. She asked him if he would want to be with her forever. He said no. She then asked him if she were to leave would he cry. Once again he replied with a no. She had heard enough. As she walked away, tears streaming down her face the boy grabbed her arm and said,  " You're not pretty, you're beautiful. I dont want to be with you forever, I NEED to be with you forever. And I wouldnt cry if you walk away... I'd die..."    This is about my previous post:   First ish : Kasip-unon ko.  I felt better. I just drank a lot of water- water therapy. Try it. It works.   Second ish : Nag ask akong boardmate magwatch mig movie.  Yup. His name is Christian. If you ask whether or not I have feelings for him. Well, that's something I have to sort out first. I don't know.  I normally tell my family about what's going on with my life here. Everytime I'm out with my friends- Cookie, Dondon, Ritchie, Michael, Clint, Christian... When I'm with my cousins- Kuya Nonie, Bemboy, Monching, JR, Tisoy, Vanessa, Tartbry... When I'm with my Aunties Negie and Evelyn... My college friends- Mark, Gee... Most of the people I see everyday. Not to mention telling them when I'm watching TV, doing my groceries, my laundry, buying vcds, and basically- sharing with them my thoughts. They are all aware of that and uh-huh, proud to say that we maintain close relationship even at a distance. SOOOO! Before I forgot what I SHOULD BE talking about... My mom knew I went out with Christian last night.  He's okay. In fairness, gentleman pud sha. Always on the danger side. Assists me in crossing the street. Open and Close doors for me. Lady's first. Yeah and all that gentlemanly stuff. And it's nice to be with a guy like that.  Funny, because my mama said, "maau untag buotan basta kay datu".Ü Hehe. So I said something like 'Joel looks better', and that 'I don't feel like it... I just want to have something to do'.  And she replied with... "Ngeheh! Kabalo ko taas imo standard. Kung duna lai pareho kaguapo ni Joel,  mas buotan  ug mas claro, mao pwede na unta to noh?"  Hehe. Bad ka mama nako!   Baaaddd!   It's not really like that. Let's just say- and I mean this-  I'M AFRAID OF CHANGE . I'm used to things without Joel or with Joel. For me, it's either that. Since there's no Joel, then it's just going to be me, myself, I and Sashi.   THAT is the only day to day life that I'm used to.    And I'm afraid that I would have to get to know another person, know his family, know his friends, know him. Adjust with the fact of knowing the things he is and he's not capable of. You know, All those getting-to-know-your-boyfriend/girlfriend stuff. It's tiring. And it's a change I'm afraid to go through. Eeengkkk! (Nothing related to Christian, this is something General).  So GOING BACK TO Christian. We watched 'My Prince and Me'. There was a scene there- Eddie is willing to wait for Page. If she wants to study Medicine, or wants to do something after she graduates- he will wait. All he knows is that SHE's the one he WANTS TO MARRY. And Christian asked me, will I believe a guy with that promise?  A big part of me would like to!!! But I guess it's no longer possible... in this generation. And another question, was there a guy who made that promise to me?  "Hehe. Murag impossible lagi na mahitabo sa ako." I replied, and I meant to say, "Yes, Joel. But it didn't work out. Too bad so sad."  So that was how our date went... He still wants to hang out in Bo's Coffee but since I have to work early the next day, we went back in BH.   Third ish : Mingaw man ko akong X  I texted kuya Sammy and ate Aljen. It's Joel's brother and his brother's wife:  "Kuya Sam, Te Alj, musta? Ug musta c Joel? Hehe. Wa na man gud nagparamdam..."  Yes, close nako iyang family and relatives. But I didn't receive any reply from them. Oh well. Wala siguroy load. Heehee. Pero  mama said buotan si Joel . That's good enough for me.

       Yes?   so i'm stuck. here in my blog. again. which is my usual hangout place. it's 2:39 AM eastern time in the US. who's gonna call at this time???  bored. bored. bored...   I researched more on this issue:  For the $109.99 charge: PR#4669605 It's her July/August Samples  For her $104.36 charge: PR#4716444 It's her host's Luisa Baez orders.  Both parties were charged on her MC with the last 4 digits 3420. If she calls and still claims that she was wrongly charged, have her fax us her billing statement so we can look into that.  Let her know that for orders placed on my sales. It CANNOT be cancelled (cuz she mentioned she cancelled her orders). Thanks.      And you don't even have any clue... So iniwi-  "Yeheeeey! Hapit na mi mag OUTTTT!!!   Naa koi ish pero my time is too short... One, kasip-unon ko. Tagdan kos akong seatmate. Teehee. Ssssh. Two, nag ask akong boardmate magwatch mig movie. Pero darn! Dili mukuyog si Cookie! Aaaaargh! Saon na lang... KINAHANGLAN MUKUYOG SHA! Three, mingaw man ko akong X. Nagcwy cwy dayon ko bii cuz I terribly miss the way he took care of me, that is, katong kami pa. Well it was my mistake, dala dala pa man gud nako iyang love letters. Sigh. Wekwekwek!  Gi Aux2 ni Ariel aron dili ko masudlan ug call. Nag Aux2 si Joanna aron dili masudlan ug call. Ingon nila wala daw koi libog! I take that as a compliment...Ü

       "Sash, nganong imo mang gabugkosan imong buhok?"   Honestly, I was   suprised   why he asked me that,  "Dili man gud ko angayan. Untidy ko tanawon."  came my reply, turning my head to his direction.   "Dili man siguro. Tangtanga daw."  He said as we went out Toby's.  So I removed my hair band and combed my hair using my fingers. We were actually window shopping and we're on our way to the next boutique. As he walked behind me, he commented yet another surprising line:  " Dili man Sash. Angayan man ka ing-ana kay sa bugkosan nimo."  as he said that,   he combed a portion of my hair with his fingers.    I stooped down and moved away, then I looked at him and smiled,  "Thank you".    "What was that all about?!!!"  asks heart. That kept me wondering the whole night...  "Simple,"  answers brain the next day.  "   it's  about a guy who appreciates how you look if you let your hair down. And that's just it.   No more no less."   Wala lang... It's something that came into mind while thinking of what else to post. I was in Cagayan when this happened, was with my ex's bestfriend named Dennis.Ü  Joey (she's my bestfriend), on the other hand told me na ganahan si Dennis nako.   Obvious daw  . But I keep telling her  "puh-leazzze...(stop)"  Shempre- this should be my initial reaction kay halos tanan na lang mga guy-friends nako, mu conclude sha na ganahan sila nako. Which I think isn't true. Heehee! Oh well!  Mau ra ni for now.

       Labs Kita, Okay Ka Lang   So what's up with my title? Uh huh- true- it's a corny line... and it's TagLish. No offense, but I hate Taglish sentences. Speak pure Tagalog, or speak pure English. Taglish is a no-no for me.   "Don't make tagal ha! I hate maghintay kasi eh!"   Ew. So veering back to my title *diverts your attention*- Well it's a Filipino Movie, and I personally think this is a movie where I or we should be proud of. *looks up at the flag (looong silence) shakes her head, & going back* It stars Marvin Agustin as Ned, and Jolina Magdangal as Bujoy. It's a movie about two since-childhood bestfriends. Due to the fact that women are emotional beings- Bujoy fell for her bestfriend Ned, while he only sees her as his pal, his buddy, his companion, his sidekick. Oh I just like the part when she said:   "Kaibigan MO LANG AKO. And that is all I ever will be to you!"   I'm not sure if that was the exact line she used, but the line above is pretty close- i hope. And do you know why Ned can't love her back? *a "no" from one of the audience* Because he's toooo afraid he might hurt her. She's way too special, he can't afford to cause her pain. *deep sigh* So anyway, other than their love story. The movie provoked me to "think" which in my case- is really rare.  So let's start with Bujoy's mom. From her, I learned   the importance of making the person you care about feel special- we shouldn't wait for a time when we can no longer do that to them  . Bujoy's mom lost her husband. She failed to treat him the way HOW SHE FEELS for him. Same was treated to Bujoy- she realized that when Bujoy told her her resentments. One of those was:   "You made me feel ugly Mom!"   And she learned that. AND I learned from her experience too.  Now let's go to Ned's Dad. He had a dream once- like Ned, he used to wanna become a musician. However, he didn't choose that desire, he chose "her"- his wife. Though she nags and nags and nags. He had NO REGRETS because he love her, and venting that out made his wife realize her shortcomings.   I learned the importance of communication. The power of love, and how patient and enduring it could be.     Sure, we can easily say- if his wife loves him, she mustn't rob him of his dream to become a musician. But hey- that's not his case. So let's zip it.Ü  Now going back to Bujoy and Ned:  Imagine how painful it was to know that he lied to her. He PROMISED he'll be there, at least he WAS- but he barely made it. He promised he won't bring her with him (Bujoy's cousin, Ned's crush), but he did. And all because he wanted Bujoy to know they're already a couple. How insensitive was that?! She made it clear- "please be there for me", "don't bring her with you"... *deep sigh* Oh well!   I guess not everybody lives up to our expections huh?    You know, I could go on and on and on... I must say, I like the movie. I LOVE the movie. It's an innocent love story. And it moved me, in a way- yeah, I admit- I am emotional at times. Heehee!Ü  And the song from this movie is: Kapag Ako Ang Nagmahal sung by Jolina Magdangal *shakes head and screams "aaaargh! not the song!"*  So much about that movie, let's go to other things I have in mind- So what's my criteria of a good quality movie?  1. A "real" movie. Where   you learn things based on the experiences of the characters.   Things applicable to real-life situations. Examples would be John Q (beautiful movie), King Arthur (about freedom and faith)... and many to mention actually. As long as it's a movie that serves its purpose, if it's a horror movie, it SHOULD scare me. If it's drama, it should make me cry. Let's just say- it would be nice to use some of your "unused" emotions once in awhile.  2. An "interesting" movie. So what are the things of interest (to me)? Movies about time, like the "Clockstoppers" - hey it's possible. Try moving a stick back and forth real fast, there's a tendency here where you can't see it- basically because it's moving too fast. The same way with a thin propeller. It's almost as if it is invisible.   Now imagine if THAT speed, is YOUR NORMAL speed, and that's HOW FAST your time ticks.   You walk too fast that nobody could see you pass them by... How interesting! Other than that movie, there are Fairy Tales- as Ella Enchanted. Santa Clause and the North Pole... etc. etc. etc.  3. A "futuristic" movie. I like   a movie that confuses me, a movie that needs analysis, a movie that I have to watch over and over again to grasp the entirety of it.   The Matrix- yes, cuz I'M SLOoOoOW... Heehee! And this one movie (which I watched with my ex- Ugh! I forgot the title! If you know this, leme know). It's a movie where CRIME IS PREDICTED before it could happen. They said the system is perfect. But they were wrong, three siblings (one of them is a girl) are the "brain" of the system. They can tell future crimes. The girl's forecast is the MOST PRECISE, and through her (and the actor), the glitch of the system was known. It's a good movie. Darn! The title is at the tip of my tongue, I just can't remember the title!  So anyway, that's about it for today. I know it's a looong boring one. So bear with it.  Ciao!Ü

       *sigh*   it's gonna be a very loooong day. it's still 4:18 AM and i'm done checking my emails. i'm done checking other blogs. i'm done surfing. i'm done doing whatever it is i usually do while waiting for calls to beep in. time check (again): now 4:20 AM. tick tock tick tock tick tock...  *looks at her fingers closely... and starts talking to herself* you know they're wrinkling- either too much water, or too cold in my workstation. *munches a peanut butter sandwich* yum yum yum! and another thing that i noticed- *she continues* my red veins are very apparent specially if i'm in a cold environment. my skin looks particularly unnatural, and queer, and odd... it makes me wonder... maybe i am a mutant. and i have supernatural powers! with the trace of my fingers i can open up a hole that is a portal to another location- anywhere, wherever! i wanna go to where dennis is! *draws a circle on the floor big enough for entry* tsssssssssssssssssk!!! with one blink of an eye... the portal opened. to where? *scratches head* ummmm... his bedroom (cuz it's still 5:29 AM and he's still sleeping). CLANNNKKK!   "Ouch!!! (silent 'ch')"    "Kinsa na?!!!"    "Sorry! Si Sashi ni. Ikaw?"  I hissed, as if I don't know what's going on.   "Sashi??? Kokong. Hoy, nganong naabot man ka dre?"  Click! *turns on the light*   "Mao nang pangutana na dili ko kabalo unsaon pagtubag, one moment I was in Cebu, the next moment naabot na ko dre."    "Pagtarong diha ba! Nakulbaan bya ko nimo!"    "LAGIIII! Giti-aw man siguro ko! Nanimbarrrroooot akong balahibo!"    "Buing! Walay kla-"  I cut him off.   "Taysa, gawas ra ta beh, kay muuli na lang kos amo."    "Ta."   He opened the door, walks down the stairs to the living room. I followed.   "Kadlawon pa ui. Hulati na lang na muhayag layo pa ra ba tong inyo. Dire na lang ta mamahaw."   TINGGGG!!!    "I don't want to (as if!)- pero okay, hulat na lang ko muhayag."   Chitchat. Breakfast. Then I went home.  And the moral of the story?  Blood is *never* blue. Blood is described as dark red (venous) or bright red (arterial). Our veins look blue because we are looking at them *through* our skin. The blood inside them is dark red and it doesn't reflect light very well. The blood you see when you get hurt is usually venous blood. Arterial blood comes out in spurts. It spurts every time the heart beats.  Source:  urlLink http://www.globalclassroom.org/blublud.html   Cge bye! Break na nako! WeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
