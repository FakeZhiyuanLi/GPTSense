        Hm, this night was pretty boring.  Started talking with my girlfriend and then with Dave.  Then, my good friend Meagan Seacor came on and we had a very good conversation.  The fun started late when Kay (my girlfriends name) gave me her friends screen name and we all started a chat.  We all had lots of laughs talking and making fun of one another.  Good times.  I'll write some more later.  Till then, have fun reading our past posts. Later.Peace.

        My friend and I decided to try and start a "band." LOL.&nbsp; Anyways, we are currently thinking of songs to write up but we are too dumb to think of themes for ourselves.&nbsp; We aren't even sure if we are getting guitars yet but we hope so.&nbsp; If not, we gonna be very, VERY, mad! LOL.&nbsp; Later.Peace.

        Today Dave and I went to the local beach and did we have fun or what.&nbsp; We were checking out ladies left and right...or rather Dave was and I was just keeping him company.&nbsp; We came up with 'codenames' for them all...(only 2 people)&nbsp; It was alot of fun.&nbsp; "Potential" was probably the best looking one there but Dave was to scared to talk to them.&nbsp; O'well.&nbsp; Then he started pursuading me to join the High School football team but football isn't really my thing.&nbsp; We went back to his house after the beach and then we played some GameCube.&nbsp; Lots of fun there.&nbsp; Then we went to go look at Dave's 'guitar' that he's going to buy.&nbsp; He's just dreaming. LOL.&nbsp; Might right about something later.&nbsp; Later.Peace.

        Today, I had the unfortunate pleasure of bowling for the first time.&nbsp; It started out ok, I came in third...and then the second game,&nbsp; I just sucked.&nbsp; But it was all fun.&nbsp; Nothing competitive.&nbsp; Then when we were leaving, we saw some old guys that looked like smurfs on the side of the road.&nbsp; We went back to&nbsp;my friends house and schooled some younger kids in basketball....sorta...all-in-all, it was a fun day I guess.

        Just got back from vacation in Cape Cod, Mass.  It was a lot of fun.  Heres the day by day report.   Monday: Went to a park and did some hikes around a huge lake (4-5 miles).  Then we spent about 30 minutes looking for a table to use for lunch.  After that we went down to the beach down the road from where I visited my relatives.  Not a lot of people at the beach but that was ok.  Monday night around 8.45, I went for a long jog.  Roughly a 4 mile run.   Tuesday: Went to the sand dunes and ProvinceTown at the tip of Cape Cod.  Took about an hour to get out there...then about 2 hours to get back because of traffic.  Then we played some minature golf that was down the road that we were on.  Saw plenty of hot chicas.   Wednesday: Sat around and did nothing in the morning.  Then went to go play some more minature golf.  Then went down to the beach again and saw some more nice girls.   Thurday: Went to this Heritage Muesum...saw some old cars from like the early 1900's.  Saw some more hot senoritas.  Went back to the house I was staying at and waited till we went out for dinner.  Had some BBQ Ribs.  Good Stuff.  Then we went to this street fair on Main Street in the town we were in.  Saw plenty of hot chicas.  There must of been hundreds of chicas there.  Lots to look at.   Friday: Went shopping around.  Bought some food for the long ride home.  Bought a new hat and looked for some hot chicas.  Then I spent the whole ride home sleeping...fun stuff.  Over all, vacation was fun..and sometimes boring...and sometimes sad...but that's the way life is isn't it?  I'll post some more some other time.  Later.Peace.

        This week I won't be able to post anything because I will be on vacation.  If I find time, I will try to post but don't count on it.  I am going to Cape Cod in Massachussetts.  I will be back next Saturday.   Yesterday, Friday, I went to the beach with Dave S.  We were expecting big waves but they were practically flat.  So, we basically passed a football around and practiced some.  Fun running past Dave.  Not fun getting tackled by him. Anyways, not a whole lot of girls for Dave to look at and judge. :P  Got to go for now.  Have a good day...or week...or whatever.  Later.Peace.

        Hm...today, I went to Block Island (local island) and had some fun...sorta.  It started out good, but then it turned bad.  We rented bikes and started biking around the island.  We got 3 miles out of the harbor, and my moms chain on her bike broke.  So we walked 2 miles back to find a phone that worked.  Then we got a replacement bike and started biking again.  Then towards the end, me and my sister 'crashed'.  We both got banged up but I think I got the worst of it.  Then my dad got pissed off at me and started making a big scene.  Then when we were waiting for the boat, it started pouring buckets out and we got soaked.  But it was all together a good trip.  Later.Peace.
