      I had my first appointment with my Nutrition Consultant today, and it turns out there's 3 possible things wrong with me.  1. First of all, she's 100% certain I've got a food intollerance. She's not sure what yet, but she thinks it's probably either wheat or dairy, since those are the most common. So she's told me to plan to follow a strict elimination diet for 3 weeks. Also, she said that addiction to certain foods is ironically a very good indication that you have an intollerance to it. That might explain why I used to be addicted to cheese, putting grated cheese on everything I ate, whereas now that I don't eat it, I don't miss it at all.  2. Secondly, she thinks I've got a blood sugar imballance, and says that I should avoid all foods with "sugar" listed high in the ingredients list. This is something I was kind of doing already anyway, but she wants me to be even more strict with it. For example, even things like Tomato Ketchup and pasta sauces contain sugar. Also, now I know why I've never got on well with alchohol. Alchohol is basically another form of sugar. Therefore, no wonder I never liked the experience - it was sending my blood sugar level all over the place. At least now I've got a better excuse for why I don't drink. Rather than "I don't like it," it's actually a case of, "my body can't take it, quite literally."  3. Thirdly, I may have a histamine imballance, most probably high, which would explain my lack of body hair, my hayfever, and also my history of mood problems. I've got to have a blood test to determine this, and if it shows an imballance, then there's specific nutrients I'll need to take.  This all means big changes, especially with regards to our shopping habits. I've been told to shop less at standard local supermarkets, and instead to shop at special health supermarkets, where they sell healthier alternatives to various foods, such as lots of low sugar foods (especially low sugar breakfast cereals), wheat free pasta, bread alternatives, and alternatives to dairy.  Anyway, hopefully I'll get this all sorted soon. I've felt pretty good lately. I want that to continue.

      It's not winter now (it's summer), but....... One great thing about  winter  is that it is an opportunity to wear warm winter hats.  Warm winter hats  are wonderful. Every season has it's good points.  Autumn  is great because the leaves look so colourful, it makes wonderful walking weather for this reason and also because it's just nicely warm but not too hot.  Winter  is great because there are no leaves on the trees and this is good because it means you can go for a walk in the woods and see more views. Also, if it's really cold, you can get warmer by walking.  Spring  is wonderful because the sun is warm but the air is still cool from the winter.  Summer  is good because you don't have to wear as many clothes, you can go swimming in outdoor pools or at the beach. See good in anything you can't change. Even  rain  is good, because when you get home and you're soaking wet, you change your clothes and this feels nice. Being really cold in the winter is great fun, because you can warm up when you get home, which is fantastic. The  darker  time of the year also provides more apportunities for walking in the dark, which is great fun because then you get to see all those lights far away, and you can get pleasantly scared in the  woods  by switching your torch off. When I used to own a  motorbike , I would ride in the dark, and if nobody else was on the road I would turn my bike's light off for a few seconds at a time. It was really scary the first few times I did it. Then it became  exciting . Then it became almost like a compulsion. Then I got bored of it. Last winter I used to drive to the  swimming pool  in my car in the evenings, to go swimming (what else?). One evening, I accidentally left the inside light on in my car, and didn't realise until I got to the other town 9 miles away. Imagine that! Whenever anyone drove the other way, they would have seen my face illuminated! I have never  climbed a tree  in the dark, not even my favourite tree. Also, I've never climbed a tree naked. Perhaps this year I will climb a tree naked in the dark. Not if it's too cold though. I still want to hang bananas on a tree though. That would definately be fun.

      Today I went rasperry picking and it rained. I was the only person there, getting wet and picking (and eating - ooh, naughty me!) rasperries. But what is a bit of rain anyway? Well, actually it wasn't just a bit of rain, it was bucketting it down. But anyway, it's summer (apparently), so it's just like having a shower, except you're outside and you're wearing clothes. Unless of course you're some kind of insane nudist rasperry picker, which I'm not I'll have you know. I'm not! Hey, speaking of naked people, there are these private woods just a few miles away near to a motorway service station, and a while back a lorry driver was caught running naked in the woods. Also, another time a man was spotted naked on a bridge above the same motorway. Hmm, I wonder if it was the same man. If not, perhaps they should get together and go fruit picking. I don't know why I just said that.

       You can't sunbathe at night. You can't swim in a field. You can't nightwalk in the midday sun. You can't turn back the clock. You can't look into the future. You can't run away from yourself.

      I did a walk today with a woman who is a complete and utter nutcase (and not in a good way). She's part of my walking group, and wants me to help her lead it in October, so we had to walk the route today in advance. What a nightmare. A total freak of nature. I'll be staying as far away from her as possible on the day. Crazy b**ch!  The weather was very nice though...

      Went to Gloucester to register with an employment agency. Took a detour home over the hills, whilst listening to an old Iron Maiden tape loudly.

      Life is art, or a dream, or both, or disapeering clouds. I dream of open spaces, but sometimes my mind is closed. Sometimes I feel boxed inside myself. Sometimes I feel freerer than a bird. Sometimes I wish it would all go away. Sometimes I wish it would never end. Sometimes time goes too fast - months pass like seconds. What the hell, is this some kind of drug trip??? Yes, life is like a drug, maybe just as dangerous, if you overdose, or underdose.  It's like, weird, man...

      He was sat there in the hairdresser's chair. Everything was normal until I walked past the window, then everything went dark. The hairdresser leaned forward:     "I can see into the mirror," he said, spookily.    "I know," said the customer. "Shut up and cut my hair!"    "I can see your face,"    "So can I!"    "Do you want me to lap dance for you?"    "WHAT???? GET OUT OF YOUR SHOP!!!" And so the hairdresser ran out of the shop, and I ran in, pulled he customer out of the chair, and sat down.    "Okay, so what'll it be?" said the customer, now stood behind me.    "A full massage with all the extras," I winked.    "Okay, I'll fetch Melanie..." and off he ran into the street. "MELANIE! MELANIE!" he shouted as he ran through the street.     "Yes?" answered a woman he'd never met before.    "We have a customer."    "Okay," she said, and followed him back to the shop.  Meanwhile, the haidresser had changed his mind ("Hang on, what the hell am I doing???!!!") and ran back. He was so angry that a customer had told him to get out of his own shop, that he ran through the door without even opening it. The customer was so shocked he ran away. Melanie sat in the chair.    "Okay, what'll it be?" asked the hairdresser.    "Well," said Melanie. "I would quite like a bowl of cereal actually."  Then everything faded and all was black, and I realised that I'd been remembering a dream whilst dreaming about walking home from the shops, and there I was, stood on the top of a building in the middle of nowhere. It weas night time. I was tired. I decided to go to sleep. I fell, and landed in a cloud.
