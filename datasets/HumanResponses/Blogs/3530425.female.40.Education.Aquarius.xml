						   The good news:  The upstairs toilet is not leaking through the ceiling below.  The bad news:  Outlaw is spraying, daily and repeatedly, in the downstairs bathroom.  What the hell?

						   The difference in men before and after sleeping with them can be amazing.  They go from, "I want you, I'll do or say anything to get you," to "I'll call you baby."  It's like flipping a switch.  After a couple of weeks of daily phone calls and emails declaring how wonderful I am, I finally made the beast with two backs with Juan.  And I haven't heard from him since.  I thought I was a better judge of sincerity, but I obviously need to reexamine my skills, because he fits the description above.  Actually, I could sense the switch the night he was here:  something was just -- I don't know -- different after we finished when he was getting ready to leave.  Something in his demeanor told me that his words were just another line.  The good news is that I'm not neurotic about it.  I don't feel I have to call or email him and seek some sort of conclusive word from him.  I'm just chalking it up to a life lesson on men.  Frankly, I don't have that much experience with dating.  Sleeping with a lot of guys isn't the same.  So, should I make them wait longer to sleep with me, to prolong the relationship?  Or should I sleep with them right away, just to find out if they mean what they say or not?  It's not a question I expect an answer to, but it would be helpful to know others' experiences.  Frankly, I'm more likely to sleep with them right away, to cut my emotional losses.  Well, whatever happens, it's a life lesson.

						   I did it!  I've started a relationship with someone who doesn't make me feel neurotic.  He knows nothing about my depression or the medicines I take -- he just likes the wonderful, together woman I present myself to be.  And I  am  her.  Whether or not this turns out to be a long-term relationship, it feels healthy and wonderfully freeing.  A turning point for my relationship with men in general.

						   I love email.  I love blogging, because when I get a comment, I get email telling me so.  I check my email far more often than I actually receive email.  It's a little like before caller ID, when you could *69 to see who your most recent caller was (useful if you took the trash out when you were waiting for HIM to call).  Of course, the last call was invariably from your maiden aunt, reminding you of your mom's surprise birthday party Sunday afternoon, but you persisted in dialing the magic code, because  you just never know .  So comment away folks.  I need the email.

						   It's day two of the first summer session at UC.  I have a buttload of reading to do, every night for the next three weeks.  But I can do ANYTHING for three weeks, right?  Right.  Just now, I'm reading stuff for Intro to Women's Studies.  Thought-provoking stuff.  Not so much the political bits, but the personal revelation that seems, so far, to be so much a part of feminist writing.  They all have a story, and share it as part of their academic rhetoric.  Dorothy Allison is tonight's assignment, and is particularly interesting.  She grew up in deep poverty, but managed to complete advanced degrees and find success in her field.  Her wavering ambivalence toward her family and background is fascinating.  While I grew up solidly middle-class, I can relate to the sense of ambivalence she expresses toward both her roots and her new milieu.  I, also, have chosen a path that takes me places different from those habited by my family.  I'm a granola-type, surrounded by would-be social climbers.  I just can't see the point of changing my values to suit those of my neighbors, but that seems to be, in large part, what my sister would do.  She dithers perpetually between being a career woman (retail being the only place for a woman without a college education to move upward at all), and being a full-time mother.  She never spends more than a couple of years at any job, and invariably leaves because of some personal conflict in her work-place.  She has a highly-developed sense of entitlement, coupled with the unsurprising inability to compromise and work well with others.  She makes friends, they discover one another's weaknesses, then she dumps them, all within at work.  So she has to leave, but it is never her fault.  I haven't really had a job in such a long time that it's hard to imagine committing to a permanent position.  I can think of things I'd like to do, but cannot conceive of doing them long or well.  In the next year, I have to choose between a job and further education.  A job would be something in the public eye at a non-profit of some sort:  special events, PR, that sort of liberal artsy-fartsy thing.  Further education would either be a teaching certificate or an MBA to make me more attractive to the non-profits.  I hoping that the Cosmos or God, or whoever's in charge these days, reveals a direction for my efforts.  I'll have 1-1/2 years of alimony left when I graduate with my BA, and I feel like any education I want to get has to be accomplished within that window of opportunity.   Unrelated to Any of the Above   I hate using common phrases like:  "window of opportunity."  It seems like I should be able to come up with my own metaphors to express my feelings, rather than leaning on these trite phrases that are so overused by hack writers.  But I'm not a  writer , really, so I guess it's ok if I'm not completely original, right?

						   I sent email to Transistion Man (TM), just saying that Thursday was off.  He emailed back, asking if he had done something, I just said no.  I know this is the right decision -- isn't it?  I know I won't regret not getting laid, even though, during ovulation week, I'd sleep with just about anything.  Why don't I sleep with Juan?  Because I don't want to break his heart.  I'm not ready yet, because I don't know if I really want a boyfriend.  Sleeping with him would definitely, for me, make him The Boyfriend.  And I can't, just can't, do more than one man at a time.  I want to, really, but he's SO NICE.  I can't be a bitch to him.  I know we'll sleep together eventually -- hell, soon -- but I so don't want to rush or be rushed.  He's so romantic, it makes me nervous.  Maybe all the compliments and so on are SUPPOSED to be part of dating conversation, and I've just never gone out with the right guy.  But I'm not used to them, coming from the opposite sex, and it freaks me out.  NO ONE has ever said these kinds of things to me.  There's nothing unusual in what he says, just the fact that he says it.  Over and over, I remind myself of what you've told me, that I'm remarkable and deserve someone who won't treat me with disregard.  And I'm believing it.  Thing is, until you said that, I thought TM's style of relationship was all I deserved.  Now, I keep telling myself that I -- and TM -- deserve better.  I want to be TM's girlfriend someday.  We'd be pretty amazing together.  I've pictured growing old with him, and it would be good.  He's 53, so old age isn't so far away, although he's rangy and healthy now.  He has such a beautiful body, especially compared to Michael.  He's thin, thin, and when he sits down without clothes, there are just little fabric-like ripples of skin at his waist, instead of a big, droopy mass of stomach fat and man titties, like Michael.  Naked, TM is absolutely lovely.  *sigh*  Pathetic, aren't I?  Seeing him yesterday, needing a haircut, a little tan, I wanted to take him behind the garage and blow him right there.  Like a f-ing moth to the flame.  Not that I'm obsessing or anything.  I'm thinking about Juan a lot too, and looking forward to when he calls, and looking forward to seeing him Wednesday night.  I'm just going to close my eyes and do it.  Maybe round can be cute and cuddly.  I just hope so.

						   I was at a picnic last night that Transition Man was invited to also.  Buffy's right (if not exactly complimentary), he makes me neurotic.  And it's nothing he does:  it's all me.  I've been obsessing ever since, although my obsession no longer sounds like, "how can I make him love me," but "here's what I want to tell him."  So, here's what I want to tell him:  He's beautiful, inside and out.  He's good at everything he does:  music, teaching, cooking, making love.  People really love him, in a full out way.  And I deserve better.  I deserve someone who will recognize the same qualities in me, not just someone who thinks I'm a good lay.  As Ames commented, I am remarkable.  If he could recognize that, we'd make an amazing team.  But he doesn't, and probably won't, so I can't go there.  I'm cancelling our movie date.  Without my usual, long-winded explanation.  Not that he'd want to hear it anyway.

						    More About Men   Juan.  Cyberdate #5.  Smart.  Funny.  Interesting.  33.  Overweight.  I'm so f*ing shallow.  We talked for three hours straight.  I even kissed him a little.  And then made out a little in the parking lot after they closed the restaurant on us.  He told me I'm beautiful, sexy.  Held my hands across the table.  We shared food.  Why, oh why can't the physical reality have just a little more synchrony with the intellectual reality?  Michael got so fat during our marriage.  I remember the  moment  I saw that he wasn't just a little overweight, but fat.  He was laying on his side, shirt off, in bed, and his back was so fat.  At that moment, what little desire I'd ever had for him evaporated.  Poof.  So I have issues with fat.  Maybe I just need to sleep with a chubby guy who can keep up with me in a conversation, and see if, maybe, it was just Michael.  If, maybe, chubby can be cute and cuddly, and not just a matter of not caring enough about MY needs to take care of himself.  Hmmm, but he's also short.  What if he has a  really small penis ?  Andrea told me that, during a makeout session, you reach down and get a feel of the goods before you commit to sex.  That way, if he's not well-hung, you can bow out before things get too far.  I remember a man who was  just too small .  Kevin.  Huge crush.  It was about six years from the commencement of said crush to consummation of the act.  During the act (and, in my defense, I was very drunk), I have a clear memory of asking, "Is it in?  Are you hard?"  Yes to both was the unfortunate conclusion.  A dick like that (picture, if you will, my pinky finger, erect).  *sigh*  My therapist would say I'm overthinking, and would remind me that  I'm not supposed to be doing that  according to his most recent prescription.  I'm also supposed to have taken three boxes full of old life shit to the Salvation Army by now, but I haven't done that either.  Can't wait to see therapist guy on Tuesday.  *sigh*  Therapist guy.  What great rapport.  If he weren't married, and I weren't in therapy...well, I like his type.  But that's definitely not a gainful thought direction, because, no matter how attractive he is, the fact is, the therapy is just too good to ruin.  Transition guy:  we're seeing a movie on Thursday.  Speaking of therapeutic prescriptions, my prescription to myself is to see a movie with him, but  no sex .  That being said, if he makes the first move, well, it is ovulation week, and I just can't be responsible for nature's call.  Especially when I KNOW it will be so good.  So many of the important people in my life are men.  Gabriel is today's obsession.  I took him and two of his buddies to see Harry Potter, then for ice cream afterwards, for his 9th birthday.  Which was all great.  But I forgot to take my medicine today, so I'm worried.  Worried about how it will go for him at school next year.  Homework and tests are going to be a gigantic deal, after kindergarten through third grade at a touchy-feely Waldorf school.  And  I do not like  that The Ex has shacked up with Connie and her kids.  What if the kids aren't nice to him.  What if they give him what he may so richly deserve in terms of sibling-style behavior modification treatment?  He's a Very Sensitive Boy, and I'm worried that there's just too much change for his little psyche to absorb in the past year.  Divorce.  Dad shacking up.  School change.  Shit, two of those on the list are my doing.  Damnit.  What I'm coming to here is, if this year really fucks him up, it's mostly my fault.  Amy's prescription on this matter:  to provide such a rich and wonderful home life with me that it will more than compensate for the shit he has to tolerate otherwise.  I'm not sure I've got that kind of energy.  I mean, basically, I've become a very me-oriented person.  I spent 17 years being Michael's Wife.  7-1/2 of those years, I was also Gabriel's Mother.   It's my turn.   But that's not how parenthood works, is it?  Nope, it's  their  turn until -- well, forever.  Or, at least, until I marry him off, and it becomes Her Turn.  Good thing I didn't sleep well last night.  Even with all this on my mind, I should still be able to sleep tonight.  Said  urlLink Gwen :  "I only want to sleep with men who love me."  OK, Juan is probably close enough to sleep with.  He seems to be moving, emotionally, rather quickly.  I don't have to move at his speed, but if I take Gwen's mantra to heart, I can sleep with him without being in love.  If I don't use it soon, it may dry up, right?  Hey, this overthinking stuff  could  get me laid.  And that's a good thing.

						   Tonite, cyberdate #5.  Juan. From Guatamala.  My first cyberdate was with a guy whose name I've already forgotten.  He was short and rotund, with bad skin.  I saw a photo before our date, but so hoped that it was just a bad picture.  No luck.  So after two dates (both dutch treat) and adequate conversation, I announced to him my intention to move on, nice to meet you, thank you very much.  He didn't like that, no, not even a little bit.  Needy Man, for that is how I refer to him, especially having forgotten his name, accused me of playing high school games.  I thought that being upfront about the complete lack of possiblity for a relationship was very grown up of me -- nicer than simply blocking his number from Caller ID.  Cyberdate #2 was the date from Hell.  And I do mean the hot, fiery part.  Mike was completely nuts.  We met at a bar -- this was his second bar of the night.  He proceeded to guzzle more beer, chain smoke foul cigarettes, belch, and talk of nothing but his stuff:  his fishing boat, his convertible, his amazing ability to DO A JOB.  My god, he never shut up.  When he mercifully got up to use the bathroom ("Beer went right through me"), the waitress came over, and all I could say (succinctly, but not poetically) was, "Oh My God," in that tone of voice usually reserved for really big train wrecks.  The waitress was sympathetic, and on a return to the same bar last week, remembered the Date From Hell.  Anyway, when Mike got back, we requested the check.  He read it, and announced to anyone who might have been listening, "I just wanted drinks, not to buy the bar."  Later, we IMed a little, and he invited me to view his web cam.  He was naked, and fondling himself.  This man, straight to Blocks-ville.  A goodnight kiss was out of the question.  Cyberdate #3 was David.  Very nice.  Quite handsome.  Reasonable personal habits.  Nice, easy date, a phone call within a day or so.  The phone call was his downfall.  He claimed to know all about me (oh God, shades of the "psychic" ex), and then made predictions about how I'd be in bed.  Now, I assume, because he's a guy, that he's having these thoughts.  Every 90 seconds of every waking moment.  But it was just too soon to hear it spoken out loud.  No more David.  Cyberdate #4 was just dull.  We held a stilted conversation in a bookstore coffee cafe.  He was nice looking, but had this enormous snaggle tooth.  One would think, at his income level (for this may be revealed in the personals profile), that he'd get the thing fixed. I just couldn't see kissing that mouth.  It mesmerized me, like a big wart with a hair growing from it.  He must have sensed this, because I haven't heard from him since.  So, tonite it's Juan.  I'm hoping for an occasional dinner date.  A romp in the hay would not be out of the question in the near future, but I'm becoming rather cynical about the long-term possibilities of anyone desperate enough to use the online services.  There are just too many maladjusted freaks out there.  I know, I've met several.

						   On the long drive home from Lake Cumberland today, Gabriel was hooked up to a tape player with headphones, and I had a number of uninterrupted hours to think about what to blog next.  As I said in the beginning, this is all about the stuff I'm too embarassed to say even to my therapist, so get ready for some therapeutic spewing:  What keeps me angry at Michael is that he caused the loss of 17 years of my life.  Years during which I might have otherwise been growing up mentally healthy, having great sex (instead of just tolerating it), and generally becoming a much more integrated person than I am now.  It's not that I can't integrate at age 40, it's that I lost all those wonderful years -- wasted them on HIM.  I remember being thin and beautiful, remember men looking at me, remember feeling really attractive.  What the hell was I doing with Michael?  I should have left him two weeks after the wedding, when he went on a business trip without me.  He could have taken me, other spouses went, but he went alone.  I remember what I bought on that shopping therapy trip -- it was damned expensive.  It's no wonder my self-esteem is in the crapper.  For 17 years, he responded to my needs in one of two dysfunctional ways:  he capitulated to keep the peace, letting me know that I was "sick," and that he was merely humoring me.  Or, he would ignore the needs I expressed (usually at the top of a shrieking voice); he figured that, once the depression was cured (better living through chemistry being the preferred mode), I would see how irrational my "needs" were, and they would simply go away.  Fuck him.  Now, I'm in charge of my own needs.  And if I choose not to meet them, that's my choice.  But no one's telling me I'm sick, or saying that my needs aren't valid.  It'll take a while before I can embrace each and every need, and sort them out into what's best for me and what's just momentary desire speaking.  Like right now.  I really need some dinner.  This is a functional need, appropriate and rational.  So I'm going to eat.  Without Michael.

						   And while we're on the subject, why on earth do men put up pictures on their profiles that look like mug shots?  Or worse?  I emailed a few times with a man who sounded intelligent and interesting.  Then I saw his photos.  He looks like a mass murderer, for god's sake.  Men can't possibly think that looks don't matter to us.  I mean, walk into a busy bar, and watch the heads swivel.  They aren't checking to see if our IQ is tattooed someplace prominent.  They're just checking to see what IS prominent (ifyaknowwhatImean).

						   OK.  In 15 minutes, I have a date to IM with some university prof whose profile I found at personals.yahoo.com.  What's weird about cyberdating, is that people jump right in to some really personal stuff, just because they're hiding behind their computer screen.  Things like sex, and what they're looking for in a relationship; stuff that shouldn't really come out until at least a couple of weeks or more down the road of the relationship.  And we make value judgments based on these Internet Message chats.  Like this crazy guy, Mike, who, when I said I wanted to date (read, sleep) around, got all pissy, and said I was a freak.  Now, if some guy told me that, I'd think, typical, and move on.  But I'm a woman, and I may want to keep my options open (to use a euphemism for sleep around), so I'm a freak.  But maybe I don't want a boyfriend.  Maybe I want to choose the horse of the day from the merry-go-round and take the ride of my choice, depending on my mood.  Maybe one day, I ride in the carriage. I just want some nice, quiet ride, nothing flashy.  But maybe some days I choose the flashy black horse, head reared back, hooves prancing, nostrils rimmed with red -- just for a change of pace.  Or maybe the dromedary (some merry-go-rounds have exotic animals to ride), because he has two humps (rim shot, groans from the intelligentsia).  Maybe I just will.    Or maybe I'll get a boyfriend who wants me badly, shags me madly, is dumped by me sadly.  Hah!  I could have hand.    You know what I want?  I want the upper hand.  I want hand with some guy, and I want to exploit it.  No, it's not very nice, but hell, it's my blog -- I can fantasize any way I want.

						   The ex's father got a boat.  A big one, for the river.  Bastard.  The paranoid side of myself just knows that the ex had a hand in this, so that he can be the cool parent, and prove that Mommy Sucks.  After all, my boat requires a 4-hour drive, and it doesn't even run.  Better believe that Grandpa's boat runs.  It probably cost him in the low 6-figures, if I know him.  Nothing but the best for the clan.  My paranoid self wonders:  what if Gabriel would rather be with daddy, the squeeze & squeeze's kids on Grandpa's Big Boat (can anyone say "small penis"?) than on mommy's hopelessly small, doesn't even run, 4-hour-drive boat.  Ames will remind me that Gabe loves me better, but MAYBE SHE'S WRONG.  It has been known to happen, though she'll never admit it. But I've know her for 22 years, and she HAS been wrong before.  Not often, but it does happen.  The first time Gabe tells me he doesn't want to go to Lake Cumberland with me, 'cause Dad's taking the others out on Grandpa's boat, MY HEAD WILL EXPLODE.

						   If you were going to write a book (and I think you want to), what kind of book would it be?  What would it be about?  Me, I'd either publish a book of wittily insightful philosophy gleaned from my years of experience on this planet.  Or, I'd write a romance novel.  In truth, I'm not qualified to write either one, if experience counts.                      **********  Well folks, I'm a smoker.  To make myself feel better about it, I'll smoke Winstons (no additives).  I didn't mean to become a smoker--it just happened.  I especially like to smoke on the steps outside my back porch.  When the cicadas have gone to bed, it's really nice back there.    If I had $1000 to spend, I'd hire someone to clear out the honeysuckle back there, and make room for the native species--the dogwood and the redbuds.  Now, the f-ing honeysuckle crowds them out.  Damn.                      **********  Wow!  Blogging may just become my new substitute for schoolwork!

						   I hear this can be addictive.  This public posting of our inner lives,360 degree exposure of our souls' hearts to anyone voyeuristic to want to drop by.  For me, I think this will be where I tell my darkest thoughts--those too sad to tell to anyone else.  The thoughts I would hate to admit even to my therapist.  Those too beastly for my best friend.  An introduction seems in order.  Newly divorced, and already dumped by the so-called "transitional guy."  Transition to what, I'd like to know?  Where am I supposed to be headed? The therapist says no more men, and the best friend agrees.  Similar opinions from locales as divergent as Cincinnati and Wilmington, Delaware.  But maybe transition guy was (could be, my ever-hoping heart insists) the love I've been hoping for.  But then, I thought the ex was that man, for about one minute, before I was swept into marrying someone I knew was wrong for me, because he insisted that I couldn't survive without him.  And looking at how things are going right now, maybe I can't.  I don't like the ex, let alone love him, but maybe this being independant of him isn't all it's cracked up to be.  But back to transitional guy, who has all the usual features we ascribe to unrequited love: looks, sex appeal, personality, and so on.  What I think happened, is that I'm just not special enough. OK to screw, competent at conversation, as long as it's fueled by booze and/or pot, and the promise of sweaty sex within the hour. And, before the ex, that describes my attractiveness quotient to all the other lovers:  convenient, easy on the eyes, willing...but just that.  I'm just not special enough to merit even interest, let alone love, from someone I'd be willing to hook up with.  Wasn't it Groucho Marx who said he'd never join any club that would have him as a member?  Me to a "t".

						   Last night, I went out with David.&nbsp; For the second time.&nbsp; His face keeps showing up on my personals subscription as a "match," and I thought maybe the universe was trying to tell me something.&nbsp; Our first date was early in the spring, and a subsequent phone conversation kind of freaked me out.&nbsp; He told me he's psychic, and everything in me went, "Oh no, not again."&nbsp; The ex made the same claim, and got really weird about it.&nbsp; I think it's possible to be tuned into your intuition and to&nbsp;recognize signs&nbsp;that less in-tune people don't recognize.&nbsp; But the ex was just f-ing weird about the whole thing.&nbsp; I didn't want to go there again.  Awkward at first, a drink got us more relaxed with one another.&nbsp;&nbsp; While we didn't get too deep, the conversation flowed nicely.&nbsp; The musicians started, and I sort of leaned into him, just in case the touches on his hand weren't letting him know I was interested.&nbsp; We held hands, he stroked my knee -- I never knew that could feel so good.  He's a good man -- rock solid.&nbsp; He is self-assured without being arrogant.&nbsp; He's an absolute gentleman:&nbsp; I was hoping, when we got into the elevator to go to my car that he'd wrap his arms around me and make out a little, but he just gave me two gentle kisses good night at the car.&nbsp; No rush.&nbsp; So nice.&nbsp;&nbsp; This one is worth seeing again, without reservation.

						   I've read the most amazing book:&nbsp;  The God of Small Things .&nbsp; Arundhati Roy is an amazing writer.&nbsp; Her words are put together in the way I want my words to read -- as if they're just channelled out of her mind, through her fingers and onto the page.&nbsp; At times, it's stream of consciousness, without the self-consciousness of writers who want to sound like it, but really work over it until the soul is gone.&nbsp; Arundhati Roy has soul.&nbsp; "Two egg twins" are with their loved better than they are cousin when she drowns.&nbsp; They are we, not me and him.&nbsp; Their life together and apart is the subject of the book.&nbsp; It's sad.&nbsp; It's beautiful.&nbsp; I had to read it twice in a row -- the first time, all I could do was listen to the beautiful words, like a written song.&nbsp; The second time, I tried to focus more on the story.&nbsp; I read in an interview somewhere that she doesn't edit after she writes.&nbsp; What we're reading is what she meant to say the first time.&nbsp; Oh, so beautiful.

						   I love having my own house.&nbsp; I love being able to read until 3 a.m., and no one says: "why don't you come to bed now.&nbsp; You'll be tired tomorrow."&nbsp; Last night, I loved going into my kitchen, right next to my bedroom, and getting a glass of water.&nbsp; I love my old, funky furniture.&nbsp; I love being able to paint the walls whatever color I damn well please.&nbsp; I love being able to smoke, or not.&nbsp; I'm even starting to love scratching my own back.&nbsp; Never, not once, have I wished to be married to Michael again.&nbsp; Nope, not at all.

						   In the movie  City of Angels , the main character has just made love to an angel.&nbsp; She bicycles down a mountain road.&nbsp; She closes her eyes, stretches out both arms, and raises her face to the sun. &nbsp; Then she smashes into a logging truck, and dies in the angel's arms. &nbsp; Is that what love is?&nbsp; That moment of pure balance and light, just before eternal darkness?

						   So, yesterday, Tuesday, I'm talking to Amy in the evening, and I suddenly remember that I had an appointment with Therapist Man.  The air was blue with the swearing.  It costs me $55 to miss an appointment, and I just don't have that kind of money to flush.  Turns out, I didn't make the appointment for Tuesday, I made it for Wednesday.  Of course!  I have Gabriel on Tuesdays -- Wednesday made much more sense.  So I remembered that I hadn't forgotten the appointment.  Until 4:45 today.  When I remembered.  The appointment.  Which was for 5:00 at an office probably 45 minutes away in rush hour traffic.  Therapist Man called my cell phone, poolside, and we had our appointment there by phone.  Only a $15 co-payment.  Phew.  He didn't understand either when I tried to explain that I forgot the appointment I remembered I hadn't forgotten.  It's a blonde thing.

						   Came to blog, and found TM online and ready to IM.  A conversation with him has greatly improved my terrible mood.  Some bitching and joking--it's a good thing.  Juan is not going to last.  Maybe not even one more date.  He's surprised to learn some things about me, but he hasn't exactly been interested in what I might have to say about myself.  The first thing we have to do is fool around, then,  after  the nap comes the conversation.  (The conversation! The conversation!)  And most of the conversation is about him.  I pointed this out, and his feelings got hurt.  Tough.  The mantra:  I Deserve Better.  The boy could be history.

						   I'm noticing that writing, especially b.s. for school, has become much easier since I started blogging.  It seems that practice, while it may not make writing perfect, certainly makes writing easier.

						   A depressed day, for reasons I can't quite put my finger on.  Dark thoughts, but more often, no thoughts at all, just a dragging sense.  I hate days like today--I get nothing done (and they seem to occur when I have much to do!).  This is a job for  Therapist Man!  whom I will see on Wednesday.  While things are working out very well with Juan on a one-to-one level, his personal life is in such disarray that I'm not sure how to respond.  His not-yet-ex-wife has moved back into their house, so they and their son are together again.  She doesn't know he has a girlfriend, but I can imagine that when she finds out the shit will hit the fan.  I've enough experience in divorce to know that there are two sides to their story, and I would not like to be her.  Is it homewrecking if they're living together, but not sleeping together?  He was physically separated, had been for several months, when we met a few weeks ago -- does this change everything?  He says he can't afford an apartment...  Maybe some of this is what's on my mind...

						   You'll forgive me, but this blog has been written under the influence.  (You may speculate.)  I gardened earlier today.  Ripped all the weeds out of a small garden, and planted daylilies ($3 from Krogers!).  All the weeds, that is, except these two, enormous wild grape stumps (of no use to anyone, really), which must have been tree-like before they were cut to the ground.  Anyway, my sorry little shovel is too weak to slice through their tree-like roots.  So the lilies (and the wild grape) remain.  I was looking for a procrastination option (having exhausted all other avenues), when I happened to glance out the livingroom window.  And there it was!  A local newspaper (Cincinnati Enquirer)!  Begging to be taken in and perused.  (You know, only in bloggs and pre-1960's b-list fiction do people use the word perused.)  So I perused it, just like it wanted me to, the dirty...sorry.  So I perused it, and found this column by one Walter E. Williams, hereinafter referred to as Mephistophilies (which I won't be using again, being entirely uncertain about my ability to reproduce so many letters in an uncertain order).   urlLink  (here)   I'm embarassed to note that the man is African American (I expect better than that from a person representing a minority group in the U.S.--talk about blaming the victim!).  I don't usually get political, but c'mon!  There was something I wanted to blog about TM and Juan, but damned if I can remember what it was...  OK, here's something I liked (and continue to like) about TM:  he listens.  More than he talks.  In the several cyberdates (I think I forgot to mention one--you can imagine how special it must have been?) (and now, a cyberrelationship) I've had, not one has asked me anywhere near the number of questions I have asked him.  They/He just talk and talk about themselves (all the while insisting that there's so much they want to know about me), never asking the least question about me.  But TM, is so hypervigilant about his privacy and avoidance of an exclusive relationship with me, he volunteered very little information about himself, always listening carefully, asking questions, and generally, avoiding any indepth conversation focused on him (and his fucking intentions).  But who knew being listened to would be such a turn on!  If they only knew.  Well, I *can* blog under the influence.  Whodathunkit?

						   Today in Women's Studies, a girl and I had a brief exchange about the difference between writen erotica and porn.  She asked me what I think the difference is, but I'm not satisfied with my response.  I said I think erotica is about beautiful, consensual sex, and porn is offensive.  I gave as an example of porn a really disturbing scene from a novel by Mary Gaitskill (whose title I've forgotten) in which one young girl rapes another with a toothbrush.  The question came up because of Gaitskill's short story "Secretary," which was assigned reading for today's class, in which a girl was spanked by her lawyer boss and subsequently abused in other ways.  The question I left unanswered is, offensive to whom?  The scene in question was anything but consensual, so for me, offensive includes rape, whether by a stranger or an acquaintance or a partner.  That the girl was emotionally damaged by the spanking is what made the story pornographic, rather than erotic to me, even though she went to the bathroom at work and masturbated after the encounter.  Simply being turned on by an act is not sufficient to constitute consent.  Our bodies often betray us in their responses, especially to sexual touch.  Have you ever not wanted to make love, but went along with it anyway, only to find yourself physically responding, even though your heart isn't really in it?  I know I have.  I'm pretty sure a Republican said it, in response to a request for a definition of porn:  "I know it when I see it."  I'm still not satisfied with this response though.

						   In this age of instantaneous digital information, we make judgments as quickly. David didn’t make our date to IM, not by an hour or more.  So I wonder about his promptness.  He was late to meet me at the bar too.  Promptness signals a certain cohesiveness of mind that he may not possess.  He reminds me of Lisa, my ex-sister-in-law.  Excited about the same things each time we talk, awed by the cost of things, slave to the details.  He’s smarter than she is, but nearly as obtuse, in a strange way.  He’s not the man I hoped he’d be.    And now, he wants to talk about having had sex, about his bizarre comments.  As if, somehow, he thought that being my “bitch” would somehow turn me on.  Maybe it’s a cultural nuance that I’m missing, but it sounds to me like some sort of sexual aberration, maybe an indication that he’s bisexual.  His strangely non-PC comments about his gay neighbor (accompanied by a drooping hand) make me wonder, now, if he’s somehow involved in the gay scene.    Or, maybe, he was just trying to please me.  Maybe this is how black men express themselves when they’re trying to please a woman.  Maybe I’ve misread the whole, brief incident.  Or maybe not.

						   Again, I must remark on the photos men include with their profiles.  Today's email loser, a CPA from about 50 miles up the highway. Either a comb-over or a bad toupe.  Why, oh why aren't the hotties responding to me?  His photo was so bad, I laughed out loud, the loudest, most sincere laugh I've laughed in days.

						   She sat in the dark, smoking.  The light at the end of her cigarette made six stars in no constellation reflect in the mirrored glass of the storm windows at the end of the porch.  Removed from their windows in the sudden warm spring, they never got put properly away, but remained on the porch, awaiting autumn’s inevitable chill to be returned to their numbered windows.  When she exhaled, she could barely see the smoke issue from her lips and nostrils, trailing toward the back yard, behind the screens.  The cigarette’s ash neared her lips, becoming too hot to smoke, and she stubbed it out in the awaiting ashtray.  When she returned the ashtray to its hidden place (for her son must never know she smokes), the last bit of the butt glowed on, lighting its location for no one to find.

						   Being friends with an old lover isn't all it's cracked up to be.  The whole time we're IMing, I just want to type over and over, "Leave her, leave her, leave her."  Shit, it's late.  I'm going to bed.

						   The joys of being single:  Letting the kids eat one more cupcake because they're going to dad's for the night.  Trading in the minivan for a 2-door, not because it's practical or makes any kind of financial sense, but because you can.  Getting a tattoo of a fairy, not because the (eventual) grandkids are going to want to look at Granny's fat ass, but because, for the first time in years, your body is your own.  When you are married, you are someone else's property, male or female.  That sense of liberation is undeniable.  So you date outside your religion, outside your race, outside your species, because you can (and it makes your sister crazy).  You paint the kitchen at 2:00 a.m., not because it needs painting, but because there's no one to tell you, "come back to bed, it's 2:00 a.m."  You build a fire in the fireplace and toast marshmallows in July, because you can.  You accept that some people won't approve of your new single-ness, stay home if you don't have a date, or go out alone; you make all these choices because you no longer belong to someone else, but to yourself only.  You do all these things (and lots more, I suspect), because you can.

						   By far, the very best parody of the political season is at  urlLink JibJab  .  You've probably heard about it:  an all-star cast of political animations sings the 2004 version of  This Land is Your Land .  Woodie Guthrie would have loved it.  It's costing a fortune for them to distribute it, so click through the ads on their website.  And don't miss the blog -- it's funny too.

						   My kid is an embarassing little shit.  Really.  I don't know why other kids even come over here.  He's moody, bossy, impossible.  No wonder the other moms don't call.

						   OK, I totally suspect Brittany Murphy of being a teen idol.  That said, I think her quote just about sums things up:  "First it's denial, then devastation. Then it's the tears, and then after that it's the chocolate. Then it becomes ambivalence and you get your anger, your fight up. Then you're back on your feet again, and you've learned, hopefully, a new lesson in life." --Actress BRITTANY MURPHY telling the New York Daily News about the stages of a romantic breakup.

						   Wow, Juan called and came over.  And it was good to see him.  I'm thinking, I may have  two  boyfriends.  I've never juggled men before -- any insights?  Or, wait, about 20 years ago, I was seeing three men:  two on weekends, and one during the week.  I had a lot more stamina then.  It looks like, in a couple of weeks, I may have Juan and David feeding me regularly.  I'll adjust my grocery budget.

						   The first week-long vacation I've had in years was wonderful.  Gabriel & I had a great time at Lake Cumberland.  Leaving the dating scene for a week was useful in gaining perspective that might have eluded me, had I been home to pursue things with David during this time.  He forwarded three funny emails, sent nothing personal, and had about a dozen women on each list of recipients.   Alarm bells!   While I may be jumping to conclusions (which may or may not be better than jumping into bed),  no way  am I going to be part of another harem.  This time, I'm on the lookout.  That said, I'm in the midst of a long, dry spell, and wish like hell I could engage in meaningless sex.  Juan is back on the scene--he phoned for the first time in weeks.  God only knows where this might lead, but the man needs  training  in bed if he's going to be any kind of a long-term prospect.  So, back to the vacation:  I don't want to vacation with strangers anymore.  I don't know what I can say to people I've just met, or their poorly-behaved children.  I'm obviously spoiled by only having spent time with kids I've known for years, because this tribe (4 plus a baby) got on my  last nerve .  It's not that I gave birth to the perfect child, but I know how to cope with Gabriel and Sara's girl Rowan at the lake.  The clogged boat toilet was the  last straw  for me -- at that point, I was over it.  Next year, friends only.  I have spoken.
