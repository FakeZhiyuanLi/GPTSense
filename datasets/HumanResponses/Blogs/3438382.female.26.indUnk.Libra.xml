         Last night, both Howard & I came home with new (to us) vehicles.  Howard got a 1998 Ford Ranger extended cab.  It's black w/fancy blue pinstripes.  He bought this because it's going to get better gas mileage than his 1995 Ford F-150.  Our gasoline bill is going to go down by about $50 a week.    I brought home a 1995 Chevy Suburban.  It's white w/black along the bottom and running boards.  We traded Howard's F-150 and my 1991 Ford Taurus for the Suburban.  I'm so glad to get rid of the Taurus.  The Suburban sits up higher.  It's a four wheel drive.  I've got so much more room.      The only bad thing about trading the F-150 & not selling it is that we're going to owe Howard's boss more money.  She'll be taking twice the money out of his check & for a lot longer.  She loaned us the money to buy the Ranger.  Oh well.  We've both got nice vehicles now.  After five months, we won't owe anything on either one.  I'll have mine for probably about 5 years or so.  Howard will have his as long as it'll hold up.  (He puts about 200 miles a day on his vehicle, usually 5 or 6 days a week.)      Well, it's time for me to clean the house.  I haven't been home for a few days.  At least not long enough to do dishes or laundry.  I went up and cleaned the carpets for Howard's boss's son.  He moved out of an apartment & left it a mess.  Howard & his boss did all of the worst clean up.  I just used my Hoover carpet shampooer & did the carpets.  She paid me $60 for about 2 hours worth of work.  Now it's time for me to clean my place & start on the laundry.

         I've given a description of my family.  Now, I'll go ahead and talk about my in-laws.  Right now, I'm only going to go into what they're like now.  What my husband's childhood was like is just a very long story that upsets me greatly.  My husband basically has three sections to his family.    The first section is his father & his wife & her kids.  They live in either North or South Carolina.  At least that's where they were living about 3 or 4 years ago.  My husband's parents divorced when he was about 8 or 9 years old.  Tom, my father-in-law, has always been a drunk & a wife abuser.  He molested his own daughter.  He never paid child support.  From the time of the divorce until when my husband was 21 years old, they only saw each other once.  My husband was 13 at the time.  Tom called Howard (my husband) when he was about 21.  They talked on the phone a little bit.  Then lost contact.  Then about 4 years ago, Tom contacted Howard again.  Howard was traveling with work at the time and was in the area.  He spent the weekend with his father.  Not much had changed.  The guy was still a loser.  He was working for $25 a day cash -- under the table.  He couldn't get a real job because there were too many warrants out for his arrest.  We kept in contact through e-mails for about a month or so.  My husband was on the road for 1-2 weeks at a time & was only home for a day or two before going back out.  So I did most of the writing.  Until I went a few days w/o checking the e-mail.  Tom got upset.  Said that Howard was ungrateful & couldn't take a few minutes to write his dad.  Of course, I got VERY upset.  I wrote Tom back & told him exactly what I thought of him.  This guy wasn't around for 12 years & was a very poor excuse for a father when he was around.  He called me a few names.  When Howard found out, he wrote his dad & told him to never contact us again.  Tom tried once about a month later.  Again, my husband told him that he's not the sort of person he wants in his life.  That's been the end of that.    The second area of Howard's family is mainly his mother, brother, & sister.  There are 2 uncles & 1 aunt that are in this section as well.  But, he hasn't seen the aunt since he was about 7.  The once uncle he hasn't seen for about 5 years.  And the other uncle he sees only about once or twice a year.  His mother, Donna, has sponged off of the government since her kids were born.  She does nothing but watch TV, smoke pot, & get drunk on the weekends.  She only leaves her house when she absolutely has to.  She used to beat my husband.  She's tried to sponge off of us, but I'm not going to allow it. His younger brother, Mikey, has been in & out of jail.  He got married a couple of years ago to a gal that makes Jessica Simpson look like a genius.  They fight all of time.  They just moved to Tennessee w/her family.  They smoke pot & drink.  Howard's older sister, Tonya, is married to a guy that's about 15 years older than her.  She has 2 kids from 2 different guys -- neither one is her current husband.  All 3 of the guys are related somehow.  Howard's mom, sister, & brother are only worried about themselves -- what's in it for them.  Our 2 nieces suffer greatly.  I'll get into more about our nieces & that situation.  If it wasn't for our nieces, we wouldn't see that part of his family more than once or twice a year.    The third section of Howard's family is the most important.  It's his aunt (his mother's sister), her husband, & their kids.  Howard moved in with them when he was 16.  Donna & Howard had gotten into a fight.  She lied & said that Howard beat her up & was on drugs.  (He's never hit a female & has never done anything more than cigarrettes.)  She was the one that was beating him & doing the drugs.  Janie, Howard's aunt, was his only hope.  Janie & her husband, Marvin, have become Howard's true mother & father.  They have 2 daughters -- Jeannie, 36 yrs. old & Tina, 40 yrs old.  Tina is very similar to Howard's sister, Tonya.  Tina also has 2 girls.  Jeannie is more of a sister to Howard than his own sister is.  My husband has referred to Marvin & Janie as "Uncle Daddy" & "Aunt Mommy."  This group is the only ones that we choose to be around & associate with.  Except for Tina.  She's very jealous of my husband & the relationship he has with Marvin, Janie, Jeannie, & her own daughters.  But, she's made her relationship with them the way it is.  Jeannie still lives w/her parents.  They live about 6 or 7 minutes away from us.  Of all the family we have, we spend the most time w/them.  They don't really fight.  We can have intelligent conversations.  No one is jealous.    There's so much more than I could get into about my in-laws, but I think I'll save that for another day.  I definitely know I'll get into more depth about our nieces.

        Well, I actually remembered to get on here again.  I've tried journaling in the past.  I usually did it every day for a week or two.  Then, every other day.  Then just once or twice a week.     Okay, I'll tell a bit more about my family.  Like I said yesterday, I was raised by my grandparents.  Both of them are retired now and spend 6 months in Florida & 6 months in Indiana.  Grandma retired from Indiana Bell/Ameritech.  Grandpa is a retired painter (buildings, not canvas).    My grandparents have 4 kids between them both.  The 2 youngest (my mom & my uncle are theirs).  Both had 1 child each before they got married.  Grandma had my aunt when she was still in high school.  Grandpa had my other uncle from a previous marriage.  I don't really talk too much to my grandfather's side.  Most of them are pretty snobby.  My grandpa adopted my aunt when they got married -- the first time.  They've been married twice.    My mother married my father after she got pregnant w/me.  They divorced shortly after I was born.  She really wasn't around when I was a kid.  She moved in w/my grandparents & me when I was in middle school.  She's never really acted like a mother, though.  My mom is currently married & had 1 step-daughter. (This is her 3rd marriage & his 2nd.)  My mom has some definite mental problems.  She's one of those that physically, emotionally, and mentally abuses her husband.  I'll just be glad when my step-sister can get out of there.  She'll be a senior in high school next school year.  Both my mom & step-dad are pretty stupid.  I can't really carry on a conversation w/either of them.  Plus, my mother is a sponge.    Now on to my aunt.  She's pretty much white trash.  She's been divorced twice.  She's got 3 boys from her 2nd marriage.  They're juvenile delinquents.  They've all been in & out of jail.  They're 18, 20, & 22.  The oldest has a baby w/his ex-girlfriend.  The youngest just got out of juvie.  The midde one is back in jail.  My aunt is a sponge as well.  She's very deceitful.  When my great-grandmother was alive, my aunt forged checks on her.      My uncle is the youngest.  He's very much a mama's boy.  He's gay & HIV+.  He moved to Florida 3 or 4 years ago.  He figured it would be better for his health.  He drinks too much.  He's been in jail a couple of times for drunk driving.  He's just too sensitive.    I'm not sure what my 3 "siblings" are going to do when my grandmother passes away.  My grandparents are constantly "loaning" them money.  My grandmother handles almost everything for my uncle.  They're all completely capable of doing things for themselves.  They just won't since my grandma will do it for them.  My grandparents have helped my & my husband.  However, we always paid them back & it was only when we desperately needed it.  We got married too young & bit off more than we could chew too early in our marriage.  But, we've learned from our mistakes.  My "siblings" are all over 40 & are in worse shape than I am at 26.  I've already told my grandmother that she needs to let them stand on their own 2 feet, because they won't have anyone taking care of them when she's gone.  I refuse to do it.  But, she doesn't listen.  Oh well.

        Well, this is my very first entry in my very first blog.  I've heard people talking about them, but I've never tried one until now.  I'll just have to see how it goes.   I guess I should start w/a little bit of my history.  I was raised by my grandparents because my mom had me shortly after turning 16.  I hardly ever saw my dad when I was growing up.  I haven't seen him since I was about 10 years old.  That's when my grandparents adopted me.  My grandparents are my "real" parents.  My mom, uncle, & aunt are more like my siblings.  I pretty much grew up in the same house from about age 8 on.  I had a pretty good childhood.  We were probably middle or upper middle class.  I lived in a 2 story house out in the country on a small lake.  I was really active in things at school.  My biggest thing was band.  I started playing the alto saxophone the summer before 6th grade.  I played it all through middle & high school.  I was in marching, pep, jazz, and syphonic bands.  I was also in many of the peer support-type organizations -- tutoring, mediation, etc.  I wanted to be a special education teacher.     I met Howard, my husband, when I was a sophomore in high school.  He actually dated 2 of my friends before we got together.  He's the only guy I've ever been with.  We got engaged on Dec. 16, my senior year.  We got married exactly 1 year later.  My family wasn't ready for me to get married, but I was.  We've got a pretty good relationship.  We really don't argue.  If we do, it lasts for about 5 minutes.  He is an appliance repairman.  He's wonderful at fixing things.  He loves tools.  He'll do whatever he can to help someone -- even if it means he gets taken advantage of.  He's 3 years older than me.    I think this is where I'm going to end it for today.  I'll add more about my past & my life tomorrow.  I'm not sure which topic I'll take on.

         Since Wednesday was the last time I wrote anything, I'll start with Thursday.    On Thursday, I went to Curves in the morning before I went anywhere else.  I usually go after I get Howard's check & put it in the bank.  But since my mom got a new dog, I had to swing by there.  I knew I probably wouldn't have the time to get to Curves before they closed for lunch, so I just went there first.  Mom's dog is cute.  It's a long-haired chihuahua male.  She's named him Toby.  He's a cute & sweet little dog.  After I went to Curves, I went & got Howard's check & put it in the bank.  Then I went to Half Price books.  I got some coupons in the mail.  I picked up "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Being a Vegetarian."  Then I went to the trailer park to visit Grandma & Grandpa & to see Mom's dog.  I stayed there for a couple of hours.  Once I left there, I went to K-Mart & picked up the pool I'd put in lay-away.  It's one of those "Quick Set-up" pools.  It's got a ring around the top that you fill w/air.  As you fill the pool, the ring rises & the pool sides go up.  We got it for our nieces for when they stay here in July.  I wound up getting it for $99.  It was $127 when I put it in lay-way.  It went further on sale last week.  They couldn't do a price adjustment back in lay-away, so I had to go to the service desk & return it & get my money back.  Then, I had to go back to toys & get a different one & go through the checkout & buy it again at the cheaper price.  Oh well.    Friday afternoon, I wound up going up to the shop & cleaning out Jennifer's nephew's Ford Explorer.  It was a lot filthier than I figured on.  The guy & whoever he was selling it to wound up cleaning out the back end.  I did the rest -- windows, dash, doors, upholster, carpet, etc.  I used my little vacuum & the carpet cleaner.  I wound up making $65.  (Which we needed this week.)    Saturday afternoon I went & bought Father's Day presents for Grandpa & Marvin.  I got them both the same thing -- a 25' extension cord on a reel w/a handle & 4 outlets on the side.  They'll both use it.  Then, Howard & I went over to Marvin & Janie's.  We ate spaghetti for lunch.  Howard helped them finish mowing.  I helped to clear the table & got the times for the movie.  We went to go see the third Harry Potter movie.  Then we went out to dinner at Pizza Hut.  The movie theater was having problems w/their sound, so they gave everyone free tickets to another movie (to be used w/in 30 days).  I think we're going to see The Chronicles of Riddick.  Howard gave Marvin his Father's Day present before we went to the movies.  I was supposed to go to Curves, but I just didn't feel like it.  It's the first day I've missed since I started the beginning of this month, so I'm not too upset w/myself.    On Sunday morning, Howard started mowing the yard at about 6:30 am.  When he was taking his mower back over to Marvin's, I unfolded the pool so that the sun could warm it up a bit so that it would be more flexible & easier to work with.  We started filling it before we left to go to my grandparents.  I think we started at around 9:00 am.  We went up to my grandparents & stayed for a few minutes.  Then, Howard & I went to Half Price Books.  (I had some more coupons.)  This time I got "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Women's Spirituality."  Then, we went back to Grandma & Grandpa's.  We had beef stew for lunch.  We visited for a bit.  Howard mostly visited w/Keith -- his buddy & our old neighbor.  Then, we left around & came home.  We did pick up some of the pool chemicals & a temporary outside mirror for the Suburban before we came home.  We played w/the pool for a bit.  I added the chemicals & Howard kind of moved the sides around a bit.  Then we went inside for dinner.    I haven't done too much today.  I do have to get started & do some laundry & dishes.  I'm also going to go out & test the water in the pool.  I've been playing the Sims game I rented.  I'm trying to beat it before I have to take it back.  Well, off to do some laundry, play the game a bit, & then test the pool water.

         We went to the flea market in Bargersville on Sunday morning.  I didn't find anything the Howard would let me bring home -- bunnies, hamster, puppies, etc.  Oh well.  I did get our nieces a bottle of shampoo & spray-in, leave-in, conditioner/detangler.  The shampoo is supposed to be for active kids in the summer & to combat the damage of pools & sun.  I figure they're going to need something like that this summer since we're getting a pool.  Howard found 2 pairs of sunglasses -- one for everyday use & one to leave in the Suburban.  (There's a spot in the roof that holds sunglasses.)  He also found a belt.  Then, we picked up a ball for his truck so that he can use the trailer & bring his lawnmower over, or whatever.  After getting Howard his fishing license, we went to Janie's for lunch.  I was going to have to go fishing w/them, but since Jeannie & Nicole weren't going, I didn't have to go.  I was going to have to because everyone else was supposed to be going.  I'm so glad I didn't have to go.  They wound up fishing for only about 15 or 20 minutes before it started to pour down rain.  It wound up just being Howard, Janie, & Alisha who went.  Alisha went to get out of working w/Jeannie.  I didn't want to go because I think fishing is a cruel game.  Here fish, you want some food?  Ooops, there's a hook in your head.  I came home & played the new Sims PS2 game (Bustin' Out).  I wound up getting a migraine & having to take an ibuprofen & lay down for a nap shortly after I got home.       Not much went on Monday.  I stayed home & did some laundry & dishes done.  Of course, I played The Sims some more.  That was pretty much it.    Yesterday, I went to Curves in the morning.  I got my workout in.  I came home & played the Curves game.  I wound up getting a bad headache again.  It wasn't a migraine, but it was pretty bad.  At least I got my workout in, though.      Today, I plan on doing some housework.  I've got sheets to wash & a refrigerator to clean out.  If it quits raining long enough today, I've got some weed & grass killer I need to spray around the landscaping.  I think this afternoon, I'm going to do a home spa day.  I'm going to soak in the tub.  Do a face mask & deep conditioning hair treatment.  Then, I'll give myself a manicure & pedicure.  Then, I'll read a bit or play on the Playstation while my nail polish dries.

         This morning I took the Suburban in to get the valve stem fixed on the driver's side front tire.  It was flat yesterday.  Howard tried to air it up this morning & found out it was the valve stem.  So, he put the spare on.  I drove it into town & got the tire fixed & the oil changed.  They didn't charge me anything for fixing the tire & gave me a discount on the oil change.  (I'm not sure why, though.)  They got done pretty quick.  I just took my "Curves On The Go" book & read through it.  I was able to get through the whole thing.  It's a very little book & most of it is copies of forms -- probably about half of it is forms & charts.    After I left Big O Tire, I went to Curves & worked out.  My stamina is increasing.  The first week I went, I was pretty tired on the third time around.  Lately, I haven't been as worn out on the third trip.  A gal I knew in high school was there w/her mother.  We talked while we made the trip around.  It made it go a lot faster.  I'm starting to do a higher pace on the recovery stations.    After I left Curves, I went to WalMart.  I had to pick up a couple of truck trunks for Howard.  Marvin, Janie, &/or Jeannie got him one & left it on our porch last night.  He really likes it.  It's a lot nicer than the plastic totes he has now.  Plus, he can put a lock on the trunks.  I picked him up 2 more.  Plus, I got a set of 4 locks.  I figure 3 will go on the trunks & one can go on the little shed.  All 4 locks use the same key.  They came w/at least 2 keys maybe even 4.  So, we'll both have a key.  I also got some grass & weed killer for my flower beds.  I'll put that on when I know it's not going to rain for a little while.      I came home after leaving WalMart.  I called Howard & Grandpa & told them I got the tire fixed & I made it home okay.  Then, I took a little nap.  I get pretty tired in the afternoon.  Especially when I wake up at 4:00 am & go work out at Curves.

         Yesterday was my "big day out."  I ran up to the shop to pick up Howard's check & put it in the bank.  I always have to go up to the shop & get Howard's check & put it in the bank every Thursday.  He doesn't want to take the 10 minutes to go to the bank.  It's such a waste of my time & gas -- especially now that there's a Super WalMart in Martinsville.  The only thing that I have to go to Greenwood for now is to get the bottled water.  Oh well.    Once I got back to Martinsville, after going to the bank, I did my Curves workout.  My stamina seems to be getting better.  I'm not as worn out on the third time around.  Once I did that, I did my grocery shopping at WalMart.  Then, I got gas.  The WalMart in Martinsville is offer 5 cents off a gallon at their gas station if you use the WalMart credit card or WalMart gift cards.  I put $50 on the card from last week that still had $15.  I put all $65 in the Suburban.  It's got at least a 40 gallon tank.  I should be good for at least 2 weeks -- probably 3.    Howard's check was about $250 more than usual.  I thought, "Good."  I paid all of our bills.  We're both wanting to eat healthier.  The healthier foods are more expensive than junk foods, so our grocery bill was a bit higher.  I bought a BIG bag of dog food.  I had to get a prescription refilled.  I filled the gas tank on the Suburban.  Then, I get a voice mail from Howard's boss -- she thinks his check might have been more than it should have been.  Oh shit!!!  There's not too much of the check left.  Now what do I do.  Howard called her (he was off yesterday).  She thinks that his check is probably right.  If not, she'll just have to take it out of next week's check.  Her excuse is that she got a new adding machine.  Howard did a lot of jobs & got a lot of extra hours, so there's no reason why his check shouldn' have been what it was.  Plus, a lot of the other guys are making what he made this week -- he should, too.  It'd be nice if he made the same about the rest of the summer.    Well, today I'm going out with my grandparents.  They're going to pick me up at 11:00 am.  When Howard gets off of work, then we'll go out to dinner.  Then, Howard & I will come home.  I'm not for sure exactly what we're going to do today.  Oh well.  I have to do some cleaning/straightening this morning before they get here.  The place is a little messy.  Oh well.

         I got some flowers planted in my front flower bed this morning.  My grandparents bought the flowers for me on Monday.  I've got a few flowers left to plant & some herbs to do as well.  I'm waiting on Howard to put up two flower boxes.  Plus, I also need potting soil -- which I'm going to get tomorrow.    Sunday morning, Howard & I went to a flea market.  I got a watch set.  It has about 5 or 6 different colored bands as well as about 8 or 10 different colored rings that go around the face.  I just need to get a battery for it.  We then went to Morristown to the Copper Kettle for lunch.  Mom & Kevin took everyone out for lunch.  Howard drove.  We all went in the Suburban.  It fit 8 people.  None of us are skinny.  I didn't care for the food at all.  My whole family acted like a bunch of hicks.  It was so embarrassing.  I'll never go anywhere nicer than McDonald's with them again.  They were so loud.  After dessert, they brought us some warm, moist towels to wipe our hands.  My family started wiping down their arms, ears, etc.  I was so glad to get out of the restaurant.  Howard's buddy found us two sets of tires for the Suburban.  Howard traded him an ice maker & an over-the-range microwave for the tires.  We loaded up some things that my mom was getting rid of (a day bed & a vanity) & dropped them off at Janie's house.    My grandparents met me in Martinsville on Monday morning.  Grandpa brought down the tires.  I had one set (the larger set) put on the Suburban.  We're probably going to sell the other set.  We dropped the Suburban off & then went out for brunch & did some shopping.  My grandparents bought me some flowers & some herbs.  (Those are what I got planted this morning.)  I didn't do too much once I got home -- just a load of dishes in the dishwasher.    Yesterday, I went to Curves in the morning.  It's getting a bit easier.  I went around three times without too much trouble.  I was also happy to see women bring their kids/grandkids in while they worked out.  We're going to have our nieces next month & I wasn't sure how I was going to work out with them here.  I didn't do too much yesterday afternoon either.  Just another load of dishes & a load of laundry.    This morning I did put in a load of laundry before I went out to plant the flowers.  As soon as I eat some lunch, I'm going to get in the shower.  Then I'll do some cleaning.  Mostly laundry, dishes, & getting the living room picked up.  I've got to go through the mail & throw away some things.

         Well, I know it's been a while since I've posted anything.  But, I had to reset my computer & lost all of my list of favorites.  I had to track down where I got this website at.  Now, I'm keeping a disk of my favorites.    I've started going back to Curves this week.  I went back on Tuesday.  I've lost a few inches, some pounds, & dropped a percentage point of body fat since I first got measured (back in October).  So, I guess doing nothing works -- just VERY slowly.  I went again on Thursday.  I'm supposed to go around the circle of machines three times, but I think I'm trying to come down w/something or my allergies are acting up.  I just couldn't make it around the whole 3 times, so I just went 2 times around.  I'm going to go again today, but again, I'm just not feeling very well.  I'm not sure if I'll go around 2 or 3 times.  But, at least I'm going.     Afterwards, I'm going to go grocery shopping & get gas.  I've got to feed the Suburban.  At least it's not the itty-bitty Taurus.  Well, time to get dressed & head out of here.  Curves is only open until noon on Saturdays.  Plus, if I don't get going soon, I'll probably not go.
