      So as you can tell I’ve had some serious issues trying to find a damn job.  After that little wasted weekend (see previous post), my mom finally seems to get the hint that I am busting my ass.  You see, my parents use to think that you can apply for a job as they did when they were young.  Meaning that you can “pound the pavement” and meet with people face to face, allowing you a better shot at getting an interview.  Well that’s far from true, thanks to the internet and online applications.  “You know Dan, we really don’t want you to move home if you cannot find a job.”  After hearing this comment it was now clear that they no longer thought I just wasn’t trying hard enough and that there were plenty of jobs in Bradenton.  They finally saw that there really is nothing out there.  It was at this moment that I knew my backup plan was the only thing I had left.  Recently my supervisor was promoted, resulting in a fulltime spot to open up.  Two people applied for it, me and another tech that has been there for a shorter amount of time.  It seemed very likely that I would be selected, allowing me to work full time and be able to fully support myself.  I would also be able to go back to school (they would pay most of it) and stop making student loan payments during that time…….  Then, as expected: ”Hey Dan, just want to let ya know I’ll be applying for full time”.  Says Mark from behind me.  Mark has been there for 5 years as a part timer and finally decided to go for full time.  Because he has been there so long, he will get the job.  I can’t be mad, he has every right to get fulltime, it’s just very shitty timing.       So now I sit here wondering what the hell to do next.  Of the few times I’ve ever had to use a backup plan, this is the only one that has failed.  I have to move out by September, there is no way I can sign a lease with only a part time job, and I can’t move home if I don’t have a job.  I really do not want to know what will happen next.

      It is safe to say that I am about to reach my breaking point. If there has been anyone to say that anything is possible if you try hard enough, it’s me. But the last couple of months cause me to think otherwise. Allow me to explain…..  Over the last few months I have tried very hard to start a career. Currently I have a job as a Service Tech, but it is just a job. Since August I have been looking to finally move forward in life, just to have all of this happen:  Accenture: First company to interview me. After 3 interviews it was decided that I was too much of an analyst and not a programmer (thank god), so I was not hired  Pierce Solutions: Had a killer interview, yet 7 months later they have yet to hire me or anyone for their open position  Tropicana: Parents friend knew some very higher up people who could have gotten me a job……then the company decided to move to Chicago  Citigroup: 3 great interviews, only to lose out to one guy. I’m still pissed about it  Certegy: A friend works for them, told me to come by and he’d introduce me to a lot of managers. So I go by there and they (HR) tell me “oh you’re looking for an IT job? Well you can only apply online.” So I blew an hour driving over there, just to be told to apply online and that I really don’t stand a chance in hell.  Champs Sports Corp.: Me “I’d like to speak to HR”. Desk Lady “They only meet by appointment”. Me “Oh, can I setup an appointment”. Her “no, that’s only for approved candidates”. Me “Ok, well can I see a listing of jobs”. Her “You need to check online for that”. Me “I have, there was no section for that”. Her “oh, we don’t have a job listing”. Me “?!!?!So can I fill out an application”. Her “yes, but you have to mail it in”   18 Different Small Companies in the Bradenton Area: Either no longer in existence, not looking to hire, or employ no more than one person  This is really getting old.

         So I get a call from a company the other day.  They were looking for a programmer position to fill and came across my resume on monster.  Let me just say that I HATE programming, but I need to take whatever I can get so I agreed to take a tech test from them.  After waiting two days [ they said they were gonna send it later on that night, so when it never came, I was pissed], I decided I was going to attack this test with everything I have.  The first issue I had was finding a floppy drive that worked so I could use my old projects as a reference.  My computer lacks one and my bros just doesn't work.  I ended up running to bestbuy and getting a USB one.  "Great, just pop this in place and get ready for a day of programming".  I had three disks that had all my projects on them, the last project I did was very similar to this test.  "FUUUUUUUCK!" The most important disk I had is now corrupted.  There is no hope of retrieving those files.  Not about to give up, I search the internet for any sites that had info....but since VB.net is the newest version out there, there is little info found for what I use, VB6.  As a last option I ran to barns and nobles and came up with nothing.  So basically I just lost out on a job.  Adding to my shit day was the fact that the people across the street backed into my car.  They managed to scratch the paint so I get the have my driver door repainted....I can only hope they match the color correctly.  Finish this day off with plans falling through to go out for a good time and I give ya the worst day I've had in years

      After 4 days in a beautiful place, I've decided what I want to do to kill this little career slum.  I want to open my own Tech Business in the Bradenton area.  Bradenton is a large-small town that could provide a lot of income for my services.  It's well known that this area is full of elderly people with a decent disposable income.  This is a great opportunity, thanks to their lack of understanding technology combined with their urge to communicate online as most people do today.  While they wont buy the most advanced PC, it is still possible to get at least $100 of revenue from a single PC sale.  There is also the opportunity to stack on top a type of warranty or more importantly services.  Services are what I want the main focus to be.  Truth be told, there is little to make in just PC sales.  But thanks to our friends adware, trojans, and viruses we'll be able to obtain steady revenue over time.  The constant lightning strikes will also bring in diagnostics, as proven by my current job.  It's typical to have a PC brought in for a Diag ($60) and have another $30 to $60 dollars in labor done to it.  You're looking at 60 - 120+ per computer.  Even with a flow of 5 customers a day, the business would make over 100K yearly.  Having Office Depot and Circuit City pushing out computers with no instore or inhome services will only contribute to our number of clients.  Not only do I want them to come to us, I want to go after them.  Having a successful local business owner in the family and a brother who socializes with high up business people on a weekly bases could help us secure contacts with local companies.  I want us to be the first person they call when things go wrong or when they just need maintenance.  Selling at retirement communities could also be very profitable, as mentioned before there are a lot of older people with money to spend in this town.  I plan on creating the proper reports and talking to the right people about this.
