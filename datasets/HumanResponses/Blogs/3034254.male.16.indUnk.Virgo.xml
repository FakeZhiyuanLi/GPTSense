      AWW! an AMAZING March Break is coming to an end!   No matter though, the events happend in the last week will be in my memories bank for a lifetime. TC is something that happens every March Break...and every year its been amazing but this year was just better because I had the chance to serve in it. As the saying goes...the more you put into something...the more you get out of it...and this was all for the glory of the MOST HIGH GOD!   God is GOOD! ALL THE TIME!  Check out teh pic of everyone in worship!   I had a chance to lead worship for this year's Senior TC...and I would have to say that this was teh best experience/learning curve ever! Being able to lead 700 people into worship, with them screaming and singing at the top of their lungs is not something that comes around everyday. During teh past 4 months leading up to TC, I had teh opportunity to learn more about leading worship and just seeing how mysteriously God really does work. At first..our team was soo not bonding and we were sooo rough around teh edges. At one point..I thought we were going to get no where...but thats when I realized I had not even prayed about teh team. I remember one night, where I was just sitting there thinking about it and getting a wee bit worried about our team, when i realized that we were chosen by God for a reason, and that no matter if we sound good or not..it was all just for Him and nothing else. I prayed a prayer...surrendering our will to His will and everything from then on changed. Our team started bonding pretty well, and we were actually clicking musically too...considering the fact that we were just put together a few months ago. Our team is Great!  So...lets fast forward to back to teh beginning of this week....we start of teh week with   Monday: teh TC Juniors....where teh kids are crazy!!!! Teh worship was pretty good too! (Good job jr team!)  Tuesday: was a rest day for me..and I tried to do some homework...but was too excited about TC..and I packed my bags and geetars and hi-hoed up to RHCCC for teh last night of TC Juniors/ crashing at Troy's Once again teh worship was crazy!  Wednesday: Teh big day! It was our time to lead worship...and it was quite nerve racking at teh begeinning but God was there with us all long and he some what calmed us down. First set was alright...as teh day went on, it got better. We started decorating our worship team shirts YEH YEH! Clara and Mel decided to sit ontop of me while i was lying on teh floor!  LOL We even had a crazy banner! Good job Mel! Teh sermons were good too! Hahaha...Media was great too! Enoch..teh cute guy???!!!  The night worship set was actually pretty amazing...alot of people went up to teh front of the sanctuaary...most of teh people started letting lose and focusing on God and going into real worship...Troy and I had some webcam convos with peeps on MSN..and talked about alot of ish...  Thursday: The morning set could have been better...but we were too hyped up on the night before that we thought we could do teh same with teh morning set....we didn't pray as much as we would have liked...floated around all day...caught up with alot of people from previous TCs and peeps from other churches...we were supposed to have our sound check...but instead Kirk Bartha wanted us to form a circle and pray with him...it was actually pretty powerful...as we were up on the stage and that was were we felt the Holy Spirit starting to descend into the room...and saying that He will shake the building and bring down all the flesh of the people and break them down...then that got to me...as i started crying as I was touched by the Holy Spirit...we just ended up praying through the whole sound check...right before we started...we had another team prayer this time...lead by Wes..and God spoke through him again...this time leaving the whole team (except for Troy) bawling as the Spirit once again came to us (Hos 6:1)...the worship was actually AMAZING and so was the altar call...Kirk had us do a chant which practically did shake the whole building! You could soo feel the presence of God in the room. God really played through us...making the worships seem even better than they were supposed to be.    Hosea 6:1 "broken and revived as one body..."  Friday + Saturday: sleeping days  Thanks to all teh people that made this one of teh best TCs ever! (O the memories!) TC Worship Rocks!   Laser Quest next week?!! Sr Team vs Jr Team!

      my day: taken from  urlLink   aka seasons blog..cuz she goes soo in depth about stuff so yeah here goes...  Enoch was spreading all this retarded propaganda and he tried to steal my wallet o_O but yeah, he didn't manage to - haha. Ernest called and he was all like, "Okay I'm coming now! I'll meet you at the park!" So we're sitting there waiting...and waiting...and waiting and FINALLY he hops out of his van with his skateboard and the whole time all of us were like, "Oh well he's probably walking over, that's why he's taking so long!" When REALLY, he was just...taking long to get out of his house =P Quite signature Ernest. [edit] Haha, and when he was coming over we all decided to take off like weirdos and run around the block - and Amie and Enoch were hiding and I was trying to hide behind this POLE but then Ernest saw us, gave us a weird look, and chased us around in a big circle until we ended up back at the park =P[/edit] Then Enoch left and the three of us sat on this BENCH in the park for like, an hour or something, watching little chinese kids run around and talking about how old we were. The fact that we were actually SITTING ON A BENCH in a park, watching kids play on the playground pretty much reinforced that point.  Um and then we went back to my house and spent the entire afternoon skateboarding. I kid you not, it was until like...6:30. And this dude from Whitby who's...going to be step brothers with this kid on my court came and he was doing all these crazy things and challenging us to skateboarding games and stuff which was a bit @_@, since none of us were really even remotely close to how good he was. But it was cool anyway, he was nice, and he just sort of came up to us and then we hung out. We drank a lot of juice...my juice. Apple and Peach Cocktail and Fruit Punch - hurray!  The Good Friday service was actually really good. I thought the Cantata was awesome, except for the malfunctioning mic and stuff.

      AHAHA Too lazy to blog so i'll just steal it off Season! hahaha  Saturday April 24, 2004 Yes yes so let me re-cap the "epic adventure" that is today, as Ernest likes to call it.  Ahem. Nice day + two boys + broken guitar string + three skateboards = ...the "epic adventure"  We went to Paul's today for worship practice and Simon couldn't make it because he had this practice for his school fellowship thinger (we missed you!) - and yes yes, it was quite the adventure. Before we'd even picked songs, Ernest snapped a string and didn't have an extra one so he BEGGED Paul to go to Strings Attached in Streetsville. Haha, yeah only us Streetsville-and-surrounding-area-kids know where Streetsville is and know about the little guitar shop and ice cream parlour - aw it's great =) But yeah, Paul lives...not really that close, or so I thought, so I wasn't really extremely gung-ho in walking all the way there. But as it turns out, after going through all these side streets and through a cemetary o_O, Paul actually doesn't live all too far away from Streetsville at all.  Yeah - the cemetary was so nicely paved, we were like, "Hmm we shouldn't skateboard through here -" but then we ended up doing it anyway...but not on the way back because there were people in there and we felt so disrespectful and...yeah =P Paul had this GREAT idea to street luge down this hill as Ernest and I were watching him rather wide-eyed-ly as he hit this gravel patch and came to a stop in the middle of the hill. Ahaha, there were a lot of really small funny things - they told me about how some guy shot them with fireworks one time last year or something while we were crossing the bridge and so on and so forth.   We finally got there and Ernest bought his guitar strings and as we turned the corner off Main, he looks into the package and realizes there's only two packages of strings instead of three, so we stand there contemplating it for awhile and he goes back into the store and gets another box. AND THEN as we're about to cross the street we see this guy, wearing a backpack and "dressed how he's dressed", as Ernest says, running. So Ernest says something like, "I wonder why that kid is running," and Paul goes, "Probably because someone's chasing him-" (yeah, these two are really intelligent =P) and then we see this middle-aged guy sort of jogging after the kid as the kid is running, or attempting to run, at full speed through Streestville traffic.  He cuts through the Main Street intersection and keeps going down the street with his backpack. The old guy, who we concluded was a store owner, eventually jumps into a car and continues chasing the kid. The whole time we're just standing there, with our skateboards and guitar strings, watching them. And Ernest and Paul were having a really funny conversation that sort of went like this:  Ernest (as the kid runs by us): Paul! We could chase him down, eh? Paul (watching the kid run through the intersection): Yeah, we probably could Ernest: Wanna? Paul: Man but he's so far down now Ernest: We could still get him though, the two of us Paul: Yeah, we could easily take him Ernest: We should Paul: Yeah but he's REALLY far down now...(as they both crane their necks and continue to stare after the running boy) Season: ...  Yes, it was quite amusing. We just stood at that street corner for five minutes, our eyes all following the guy running and eventually the old guy chasing after him in this red car - at which point the boy had pretty much disappeared from view and we continued on our merry way. !!! And another thing is that Paul and Ernest wouldn't buy me ice cream from Murphy's. Aw...Murphy's ice cream is so good. Murphy's is liks this tiny, tiny (well it used to be tinier) little ice cream shack at Main and Queen street in Streetsville - where there's the little guitar shop and this candy store and Second Cup and all. I really like Murphy's frozen yogurt - it's GREAT. So Paul and Ernest said we'd make ice cream floats back at Paul's, but we never did. Sigh =P  On our way back through the cemetary Paul noticed this beehive hanging from a branch in this tree and starting throwing ROCKS at it like the little troublemaker that he is and Ernest and I were like, "RUNNNNN!!" but thankfully none of the rocks actually hit the beehive, or else it would be DISASTERRRR. And then the boys decided to race each other up this hill, with Paul taking this little off-the-road trail thing with a little footbridge and then scaling up this embankment to get to the top part of the cemetary and yeah. Then there were people in the cemetary so we walked until near the end and yeah we eventually ended up practicing for tomorrow.   All in all, a good day.

      today was quite interesting. well then, it was quite the peculiar day at summer school...it actually did not feel like school for once. so we're studying Hamlet as our last unit and normally we would follow some recording done by actors with the book. today our teachers decided to show a 4 hour version of Hamlet instead. so from 10:15 till 1:45, we were forced to watch Hamlet. then our teachers (2 classes combined as 1 for the movie) : who stick together in everything including the exact SAME lesson plans...anyway so our teachers decide to order in pizza just for the heck of it. so here we were in summer school watching a not-so horrible movie and getting a spontaneous pizza party which i dare say was quite a relief from "normal" school.   so i bought a Jimi Hendrix cd today after school and i have to say: HE IS FRIGGIN AMAZING!!! ESPECIALLY LIVE!   the weather today was quite fantastic. so i decided to go for&nbsp;a 35 km bike ride. the bike ride was quite uneventful but very enjoyable. on my way back from erindale park, i saw a similar figure skateboarding on bristol. it turned out to be my buddy darosh from school. he was carrying a complete skateboard and a deck...turns out he JUST went a bought a brand new board. he said he hated his previous deck in which is still in fairly new condition so he just goes and buys a new deck. he knows i skateboard as well and with him seeing no use to his "old" deck, he gives it to me. to me that was a complete shock as he was giving away a $100 deck to me. i was quite happy when i resumed my ride. =D  fellowship was good. we had prayer path tonight. it was a good chance to reflect on spirital aspects of my life and see where i'm failing. howard, paul, simon, alan, joeie, sam and i got into a good conversation of how to convince others about our God in existence. then the guys had a good ol talk and the night was ended off with jamming and other fellowship.  tomorrow is the softball midseason event! and the United Olympians take on Butterfly at Heritage Hills. come see the action!   that is all kids p.s. 3 MORE DAYS =D  fare you well,  exeunt

      so Season hates surprises. ahh! Season is 16 now! *tear tear* shes growing up...but then again...aren't we all. yes yes, so we had this surprise birthday party for her again this year. but now, i found out that she actually hates surprises. anywho, we had good ol fun with people from the east coming out as well. they include: mel, jen, donald..er..charles and ryan..um...sven or derr-ee-i-CK harhar. when we first got to Season's house, we (me + foreigners) decide to write a message on Season's mirror. so donald and i, being all cool and all wrote: HAPPY BIRTHDAY SEASON, FROM JASON. with Season's mom's lipstick. so then we proceeded to playing some weird game that included some intense hand-eye coordination, but us guys got owned by the girls. the rest of the gang started arriving and we all chilled in the basement. then season comes home...walks loudly...runs upstairs to her room. bang! we start hearing slamming of doors, and the boom boom boom...season...sounding pissed...saying how she hates surprise parties...and she KNOWS we're here and how we're mocking her intellegence. so here we were...all of 14 of us..in a room in the basement...listening to this...and all thinking..."uh oh, shes pissed, guess we'll camp here for the night". but thankfully, she found us and we all proceeded in normal party business.  best birthday present ever. so i had to get season a birthday present. i wanted to buy her something at first, but then thought...mmm birthday presents should be memorable...*ponder*..aha i'll make her something. but what? then i thought...hmmm she does like spiderman..and superheros...AND she does have a superman shirt. so why not make a cape that matches with it and make it really cool. and the result? its totally awesome. and it glows in the dark as well..so that she will never forget it! hahaha. i also made her bling bling as she can't be a gangstar superhero with out bling. i hope she likes it.

      man, i'd have to agree with Simon. today in sunday school, Huston was talking to us about life after high-school, which is basically university/college life. after hearing what he had gone through, i'm not so sure if i'm looking forward to it anymore. the thought of falling behind in classes, then skipping some classes to study to try and catch up, yet you're actually putting yourself further behind, and then leading to&nbsp;failures and probations. just hearing that strikes fear in someone with poor time managment skills, someone like me. also, the fact that in university...no one cares whether you go to class or not, or if you don't do your homework just adds to the list. all nighters working on assignments, crazy crammings late at night ugh its stressful just thinking about it.not only is the work intimitating, but the environment that we enter into. right now, we live a sheltered life with everything provided for us, but once we move out, we're on our own, we're vulnerable per se. vulnerable to all kinds of temptations and peer pressure. drugs, sex, alcohol are all very evident on campus and we are all vulnerable to satan's traps. the feeling of isolation because you believe in something different than the rest of the people and not fitting in because you have high moral standards all add up to the fact that university is indeed a scary place.  on the contrast. yesterday was such a beautiful day. perfect for the MCBCSL midseason event held at Jack Darling park. it was quite the day with Toronto perfectly in view across a blue Lake Ontario. of course, there was the geese and seagulls. so jeff had this crazy idea of feeding geese bread from his hand. they started hissing at us and seemed like they were about to attack us, and one of them even drooled on jeff's hand! eww, it was gross. then we come across this sign that says: DO NOT FEED THE GEESE and we were like uh oh. so then we sat on one of the extentions out onto Lake Ontario and started talking. all of a sudden these cops come up to us and we thought they were gonna arrest us for feeding the geese. but they were just doing a routine drug test.   later on in the day. the United Olympians faced off against Butterfly in a MCBCSL game. butterfly started the game strong leading all the until the 6th inning. right before i got out to play in the second, there was a giant umbrella that was just laid in crate (our team mascots are umbrellas) and i accidentally tripped and fell on top of the crate. my hand caught the umbrella and it shot up right at my mouth. the hard wood smashed into my lip and it started gushing blood. now i've got a fat lip. we managed to tie the game at 14 at the bottom of the 6th. then at the 7th inning, butterfly was up to bat first and they mananaged to score 2 runs on us. the score was now 16-14. our turn at bat, we get 2 runs back. the score was now 16-16. with sammi on third base and 1 out, terry steps up to the plate to bat. the pitch comes and he hits a nice, fast grounder through the rover/3rd base, sammi makes a run for it....and she's home! the united olympians win 17-16!   all in all a good weekend i'd have to say. summer school ends in 3 days!  that is all for now kids. exeunt.
