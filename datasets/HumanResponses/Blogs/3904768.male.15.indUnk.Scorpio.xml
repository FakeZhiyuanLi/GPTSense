        okie... i havent blogged since wednesday so i think i have quite i bit to say... lets start with.... thursday... well i had my english oral exam&nbsp;with steven ng (ugh) and the reading went rather well, the picture discussion was fine... but i got slaughtered during the conversation! i knew tht i was using too many "its like"'s in my conversation and i was going like >> shit. he's going to penalize me for using too many "its like"'s and he did just tht. bah. anyway... after tht i had to rush 4 the stupid sacred night rehearsal... which was a  TOTAL  waste of time since we were only playing 5 minutes of background music.... ugh.... then shawn got into an accident.. or actually he accidentally didnt see an oncoming motorcycle when we were waling to dover market for lunch and he hit the motorist arm and he went skidding... lol... good thing tht guy wasnt a gangster or shawn would be dead.. good thing Bongard was there or else we all die.. Xl haha... ya.. sacred night was ok... went out with aaron, silas, yu long, tim wan, adam, and some alex guy i think haha went to holland v to eat some beef kuay teow.. yummy... went home late. haha.... ok    >>>>>   friday. went to sch... got released really early at like 12 because we were performing tht night.. for FOA... haha.... aaron and i went to gabriels house cos we had like this 3 hour break before the rehearsals started... haha... played fifa 2004! so fun and gabriel and i beat aaron with Man U! haha... arsenal always loses.. haha..

OUSTANDING  !   XP then we went out as a whole group mainly sec 4s and nicole and her friends... first we wanted to go to hagen dazs but it was full so we the impatient ones (aaron, gabriel, eka, david, hussein, shawn, joseph, nicole and friends) decided to go to starbucks but it was also full so we went to swensons... haha.. gabriel blew up this plastic thing for your wet umbrella and i squeezed it and it burst like an explosion and eveyone stared @ us... haha... ok then @ the other table.. they were just disgusting mixing all kinds of things into the ice cream... yucks.. haha... ah.. good thing gabriels father came and sent us home or else i would have reached home at 12.45.... went home late again.. haha..   >>>>>   sunday. had to wake up early for church. 700 hrs.. argh... haha... church service ended @ 1100 hrs... then we had lunch and these weird pple downstairs were doing some heritage thingie.. haha.. all muds... =x haha... then i went to city harvest with some friends (aaron, silas, joshua, tim wan, harold) just to visit and check it out.. there were like free hot dogs and ice cream and the whole place was super crowded... after the service we went to play basketball near aarons house. (aaron, adam, silas, joshua, tim, harold, kim) it was like so fun... i drained 2 2 pointers, 6 3 pointers and one from just inside the half line XP haha... then went to my grandmas house to celebrate my cousins bday.. haha...   >>>>>   monday. brought my guit to sch today... man i need to improve.. i need to go practise in a graveyard... haha.. lol... charity cafe today! missed all the lessons except chem. haha... and pc... which was like so fun.. haha. talking all tht nonsense... then went to the archive area to practise guit and watch pple break dancing... haha..   and my strap gave way and my guit went crashing to the floor!!   i was like totally   traumatized .  argh... now there is a chip on the side of my guit ): bah. oh well.... wat to do... makes it look a LITTLE artistic... lol... well tht was a really long blog.. i'll stop here!    &nbsp;  Gerald    RoXyNsExy
