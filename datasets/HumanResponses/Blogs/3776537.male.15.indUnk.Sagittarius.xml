      Ok the match itsself was pretty good ill admit.  I know Benoit is the champion and would probably win but i didnt expect him to win the way he did.  The last 10 minutes of the match Benoit was pounding on Kane like he was a little baby, then out of nowhere comes a Crossface and he beats him.  That really makes Kane look like crap.  They do this all the time with Kane, they make him look indestructable and then at the ppv he loses his match.  Maybe he has superpowers and looses them when he enters the ppv.  They done it at the Undertaker vs Kane match as well.  The least they could have done was make Kane look like he was a decent wrestler and maybe have a chance at beating Taker.  Bottom line.  They build Kane up for the big event and make him loose.  Maybe they should put the belt on Kane to make people fued with someone else that is not Triple H.

      The other day at my friends house some of his friends that were there decided to smoke weed.  That was cool and all.  Then my friends brother takes a big hit off of the roach and throws up everywhere.  Normally you smoke weed NOT to get sick but not in this case.  Ive never heard of anyone throwing up smoking weed.  But i thought it was really funny.

      I am currently playing the Mega Man Anniversary Collection game for the PS2.  This is a great game for any Mega Man fan or old school gamer fan.  For just a mere 30 dollars you get Mega Man 1-8 plus 2 arcade Mega Man games that were never released in the U.S. beat that.  The game is also full of original art from the creators, new remixed music inspired by the series, and lots more.  The game also features two ways to play the game.  You can either play it totally original, meaning the games being played exactly the way they were meant to be played on their original console system, or you can turn the "Navi Mode" on and play the game with all new remixed music and a new "Hint" mode that gives you free hints when things seem to get a bit hairy in the game.  That is all for Devin's Reviews for the Games he Plays.

      As of late i have been building up for Jeff Hardy's return in the WWE possibly to save his brother Matt from the evil and sinister Kane.  That all got flushed down the toilet when unexpectedly Jeff shown up at a NWA:TNA ppv in Nashville last week.  Apparently Jeff is under contract with NWA:TNA seeing as how he was in a title match against AJ Styles for the X-Division Championship.  In a recent interview with Jeff's mother about his debut, she claims to have not known anything about it and that all she had known was that Jeff got on a plane to Nashville.  As of now Jeff fans are waiting for more news about his NWA:TNA contract.  Jeff however, was not at last weeks Impact event and was rumored that he is already in trouble for being terribly late to the ppv.  More will be posted on Jeff Hardy as news becomes available.

      Recently on the Smackdown! brand on the WWE they have made the WWE champion none other than Bradshaw.  What is the WWE thinking?  Making the WWE champion the same guy who used to fall job to Ryno only a few weeks ago?  I always thought of Bradshaw as being a mid-carder.. if i even gave him that good of a name.  I dont know whats going thru the mind of Vince McMahon but it looks like he just killed the Smackdown! brand.

      Yesterday.. well actually early this morning me and my cousin went camping.. we got hungry and it was about 1:00.  We figured Taco Bell was still open because the sign said they were open till 2 A.M.  So we get out there and the whole trip me and my cousin are anticipating getting the Grande Meal with 10 tacos.  Oh how great it would taste.  We got to the door at 1:30.  Plenty of time to get some last minute tacos in our tummy.  So we pulled on the door and it was locked.  NOOOOOOOO! we shouted and there was people inside just dilly dallying around.  It was so gay and we were forced to eat at the only 24 hour resturant in Middlesboro... Krystals =-(  Taco Bell will be forever gay.

      I am currently watching the Eugene vs Benoit match.  Eugene is doing a great job for being a retard.  Eugene thought he got the 1 2 3 on Benoit and now Evolution is coming to the ring.  Evoultion pounds on Benoit while Eugene is trying the break them up.  William Regal comes to the ring and tries to help.  Eugene has a mental break from time to time and starts beating the other guys senseless only to run into a big boot from time to time.  *KICK* *WHAM* *R.K.O*!!  Now Evolution is just pounding the crap out of Eugene and he gets a *KICK* *WHAM* *PEDIGREE*!!  Its over my friends.  But i didnt see a foot on the rope so i think Eugene should be champion ha.

      My quest for DDR is now over.  Its been a solid 3 weeks calling every game store around my area.  Finally a Wal-Mart has it.  After asking the dude about the game he says they dont have it in stock.  He checks anyway and finds just one more game left back in the deepest darkest corner of the game case.  Woooooo! Thats good news for me.

      I just got done watching a Million Dollar Man biography thingy on some channel.  Pretty interesting stuff about him.  His stepfather was none other than Iron Man Mike which influenced him in the wrestling career.  His mother was also in the wrestling business. While going coast to coast wrestling for some small curcuits Ted recieved a call from Vince McMahon for him to wrestle in the WWF.  Of course he took the offer and became the Million Dollar Man.  But it wasnt enough to look like the Million the Dollar Man, he had to act like it.  He stayed in the best hotels, rode in limos, and done everything else a rich person would do.  The crowd hated the Million Dollar Man but Ted loved it.  Just some interesting facts i thought i would share about a wrestling legend.

      Recently I went and seen the movie The Village.  I was told it was suppose to be the greatest movie ever by some reliable sources.  I go and see the movie and turns out it was almost the worst movie ive ever seen.  I didnt like it because of several reasons.  These include it being too short, it was the type of movie that made you think through the whole thing to figure out the twist, and the twist was even stupid.  And for the fact some of my family and friends were trying to compare it to the movie The Others because it had a twist like The Village did.  I for one think The Others was one of the better suspensful movies i have seen and should not even be used in the same sentence as The Village.  Bottom line  The Village stunk and I could have died happy never haven seen the movie.   Quote that TV Guide.

      I havent made a post in a while... It could be because I have such a boring life.  Nothing cool really happens around where I live or in my life for the matter.  But theres probably a reason for it and life should start to get better.  I dont think i could handle an exciting life so maybe i should just be happy with having an average everyday boring life with nothing to do but eat and sleep.  Yeah i'll go with that.
