        I, Robot is a famous book written by Isaac Asimov. In his book he writes The Three Laws of Robotics and that all robots created must follow this rule. In the movie the head designer at a United States Robotics is found dead. All facts point to suicide, but Will Smith a homicide detective that has a bad background with robots is determined to blame a robot. Overall this movie is very well throughout and there is never a dull moment. There are parts of the movie that are very unrealistic, but most movies like that. I recommend going to see it, but if your like reading the book is much better.

      I can’t stand reading; in fact I haven’t read a complete book since 7th grade. I always get to lazy or to bored half way through the book and just look up the ending on spark notes, but today that changed. I started reading a book called Digital Fortress, by Dan Brown. Brown is most famous for his book The Da Vinci Code. I started to read the Da Vinci Code but it was one of the most confusing books I have ever touched. Digital Fortress is a mystery/thriller book about the National Security Agency and their encryption machine that has worked for decades and one day it faces a code that it can not break. In less than 12 hours I read 200 of the 375 page book which is a record for me. I hope to finish by tonight and I have purchased another book by Brown called Deception Point. Dan Brown is one of the best authors I have ever read an plan to read more of his books.

      After seeing this movie I think its his best movie yet, ten times better than Signs. It has so many twists. There is just one problem with it, it shouldn't be labeled with the Genre Horror. In fact its hard to place it in a Genre. It has many different elements and that's what makes it so great. I would recommend going to see it and if you have time see it twice. Have ever seen Mission Impossible? Its one of those movies were you can watch it 20 times and still find something new out, well The Village is just like that. I have seen it 3 times and it never gets old.

      Whats the big deal! I am a hugh Yankee fan and I don't see why the Yankees are always criticized for spending a lot of money on their team. They do have the highest payroll in Major league, but there are other teams right behind them like the Red Soxs and Mets. Plus its not like every game they score 30 runs and shut down the other team. If I'm not mistaken, I believe if any other team had the money they would do the same thing. One last thing, the Yankees spend their money wisely, unlike other teams who spend their money they get from revenue sharing to BUILD A WATERFALL IN THEIR OUTFIELD!
