        What a great day to be back to flying.  I have a wonderful crew.  The captain and other flight attendant (Ann) are the ages to be my parents, while the first officer is 28 (same generation as I); so it's funny to talk together with our generational gap.  I used the phrase "mad props" which confused the captain (Chris).  He asked where it comes from, to which I have no answer (I will look it up later).  The first officer (Mike) brought up the term "bling-bling", which was just as foreign to Chris.  When I said that it came from Puff-Daddy, or P-Diddy, Chris said "from WHAT?"  That cracked me up.  On a twenty-passenger flight, only 2 knew the word "props" (not as in propellers)...I made an announcement for the survey.  So Mike and I are enjoying our own little connection on the culture front, and are amusing ourselves as well as Chris and Ann.   My writing is right on tonight because it has been a long day.  We had to be at work at 10am and got to our hotel at 10pm.  We had a 2 hour break after our first flight, but then flew straight the next four-flights without any breaks.  So, here I sit in my room in Boise.  I am tired, but since I had a good day, I have a weird energy.  I think it is a mental thing, but my body is slowing down...even my mind is trying to shut down.   It's days like this that make it hard for me to ever imagine not flying...and the days when I get to fly for free, who wants to give that up.

        After nearly one full month, have only worked one overnight, two round-trip days, and 3 days on airport reserve (all the rest spent on home reserve and normal days off); I am going on a 3-day trip starting tomorrow morning.  I stay in Boise tomorrow night, Sacramento on Sunday, and back home on Monday.  I am on the Q400; my favorite aircraft.  Long days, except Sunday.  Hope I get time to lay in the sun...with sunblock on of course.   Yay, I got a coverage line next bid.  No reserve days.  I will either have to get vacation for the beach camping trip, drop the flights from my schedule (no pay), or not go camping.  I will figure something out.

        So, a random guy emailed me on my birthday.  He got my email address off the Disney Alumni website and decided to send his wishes.  I emailed him back, and due to boredom and a little bit of intrigue I started IMing with him.  Right off the bat he sent me his picture, not a bad looking guy, just kind of average.  He asked me for a photo and I told him the truth at the time, that I didn't have any photos on my computer due to repairs that wiped my hard drive clean.  I hoped this would be enough, but he asked when I would get one, to which I replied I wasn't sure because I had to get them from friends and family.  Also the truth.  What I didn't tell him is that I don't agree with sending my picture to people I don't know.  Nothing wrong with that, right?  But every time we chat we spend the majority of the conversation going over when I will have a picture.  Other than the picture quest, he has asked if we can talk on the phone, chat using MSN messenger so he could use his webcam and audio, and maybe one day meet up in DC.     Today (almost a month later) it all came to a head.  He said that I was being "standoffish".  I tried to tell him that I want to keep it simple and he just mocked me, "procure...big word there for someone who likes things simple."  I tried to explain without any detail that I have laid my cards out before and have lost myself (the whole band thing), to which he said that he understood.  But then just went back to asking me if I would ever send him a picture.  At one point he said that it wasn't fair that he sent me one of him and I hadn't given him a face to go with the conversation.  I reminded him that I never asked for his photo and never said that I would send him one.  He agreed that that was the truth.  Then things went on hold: he said, "BRB".  And thus this is where we stand.   I know I should probably just ignore him, but that is hard for me.  I like to have someone to chat with, especially since I have been sitting at home a lot.  And I don't like to be rude.  I know, what do I owe him, right?  Ugghhh...sometimes I hate having so much compassion for complete strangers.  But that is me.  And like I have told this guy, you gotta accept me for who and how I am, or move on.

        While my parents are away for the summer, I get the wonderful opportunity to water my Mother's 140 rosebushes as well as the thousands of other flowers in the yard. (please note the sarcasm!)  Well there are timers on the watering system, but like everything else in this family, something has went wrong and the water does not go on automatically.  There are at least 6 areas where the water needs to be turned on for 30 mins-1 hour each day, plus a few areas that need to be hand water for 5-10 mins daily.  Not to mention the roses (all 140) that need a deep watering each once a week.     This doesn't seem too bad, I suppose, since I am home a lot and find myself bored.  BUT, it takes all day.  Not to mention that on hot, sunny days, you are not supposed to water between noon and four in the afternoon.  Hello, those are the hours in which I might actually get out of the house.   I love my mother, and I enjoy the look of the flowers...they are just too much work.  And all I have to do is water them.  My mom weeds, plants, fertilizes, trims, and so much more.  I give major props to my mom...I just wish she was home to do her own watering.

       urlLink    Here's my dad and my nephew, Tristan.  Tristan loves Bob the Builder and thus loves any vehicle that resembles work equipment.  He loves to play in Grandma and Grandpa's back yard where there are plenty of fun things.  Tristan especially loves to ride on the lawnmower with his Grandpa!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Here's Anthony filming the Rose Festival Grand Floral Parade.  I went met up with him and Alyssa.  Alyssa's mom is a Royal Rosarian.  She was the first one in the parade.  It was fun to hang with A&A and get out and about.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is Colleen and I in Miami.  Yes we are in the shower together.  The shower was weird it was just off the bedroom and had no shower curtain.  We made Duckens leave the suite when we needed to shower.&nbsp; urlLink

        Being on reserve this bid, leads to a lot of time at home on my couch.  I am not complaining necessarily, but a couple of weeks of this and one can get bored.  A previous friend once said, "Only boring people get bored!"  I took offense to this line then, and still do now.  I am not a boring person, but I do tend to find myself bored.     I know why I feel bored: I am lonesome.  Most of my good friends live elsewhere.  Colleen in Pittsburgh.  Mindy also in Pittsburgh.  Rosalie in New York.  Jordan in Boston, Alaska, Florida.  Tina in Chicago.  Even those in the same state as me, are not around.  Alyssa and Eric, both in Eugene.  A bunch of cool people in Ashland and Klamath Falls.  In town is my best guy friend, Jeremy.  But since I went away to college, and even though I've come back, our encounters are few and far between a lot of the time.   Another reason I feel bored:  I am in a job where I don't feel that I am actually doing anything.  Sure I provide awesome customer service, but my heart just isn't in the wonderful world of transportation...also known as being a Flight Attendant.  I will write more about this in another entry, trust me.     One good thing that has come out of all this time by myself...I am learning how to be by myself.  And though I get bored, and am lonesome often, being by myself has been kind of fun.  I sleep when I want to.  I clean up when I want to.  I watch whatever t.v. I want to.  I can dance around the house singing at the top of my lungs if I want to...and I have, though it scares my cat Tina.   So basically, boredom isn't always a bad thing.  I even think we over use the word "bored".  For me it can mean lots of things: lonesome, tired, anxious, etc.  I am not a boring person, I just let myself do nothing more than I like sometimes.   Okay, so now I have to get back to paying attention to stupid t.v. and be "bored" some more.  Oh yeah, here's a shout out to Rosalie for providing some breaks from being lonely throughout my days.  Thanks.

      When I called work this evening to get my assignment for the next three days, I found out that I am going to overnight in Medford tomorrow night.  Though I am not happy about the three days of grueling work, followed by three more days of work...I am happy that I am going to Medford.  Medford means I get to see my friends from college.  I miss them, and I miss Southern Oregon.  Hanh is going to come see me in Medford.  And hopefully I can get ahold of Joe.  Troy will not be in town, but will leave me a DVD and CD at Joe's.  Who knows if I can get ahold of Ben, and if I do he probably won't make it to see me.  I will call him tomorrow from Medford.  I hope I get to see him.  All of my friends in Southern Oregon make me feel wanted and whole.  I miss them so much.  I did the majority of my growing up there and with them.  I learned how to be independent and to be myself.  I love them all so much.

      It was nice being back to work...I say "was" because I am now back at home with a new job injury.  I pulled my back while opening the main cabin door.  The release handle was extra stiff, and being the shorty that I am, I was this-close to not getting the door open.  Though I successfully opened the door after awhile, I also successfully screwed up my back.  I took myself off the end of my trip and have been on sick leave for three days.  I go back to the doctor tomorrow morning, but Tom from Horizon's first aid thinks I will have to go back to light duty.  Suck!

        Okay, so the title of this entry only has to pertain to one part of what I am going to write...but I will start with that story...Today as I was working the Seattle/Express Lane at security in the airport, I was checking the name of a passenger to match the boarding pass to her ID, when I recognized the name...Carney Wilson.  I looked up and sure enough it was the WILSON of Wilson Phillips.  I don't really know their music and thus was not completely star struck.  However, this being my first "celebrity" meeting since leaving Disney, I was pleased to recognize her.   Yesterday was the Fourth of July, my first celebration of the holiday with friends and family and our own fireworks in many years.  I started off at Marcus' for a barbecue.  The nephews were there and having a blast in the pool and in the bouncer.  It was nice to meet new people and see some familiar faces in Andrea's employees and friends.  I just found out that Dave is a Yankees fan...it took him over a half hour to notice that I was wearing a Red Sox hat, but as soon as he did the mutual razing was on.     Well I left early to head over to Alyssa's mom and step-dad's new place just down the hill from my home.  Ed went totally crazy with the illegal fireworks.  Anthony and I were quite spooked by them.  They have gotten so big, they are like the professional ones.  Ed would light like 6 of them at once with the blow torch and they would last for a couple of minutes.  The backyard has a great view heading to the west, so we could see everyone's fireworks for miles.  All in all it was a great 4th.

      Tonight I decided to cook dinner, and thus had to go to the grocery store.&nbsp; I didn't feel like dealing with the masses at the local One-Stop-Shopping store, so I stopped by the neighborhood basic grocer.&nbsp; For anyone who has ever been in SE Portland, you know that most of the people who frequent the Red Apple store fit into either the red-neck or white-trash categories.&nbsp; Yes, I know I also frequent the Red Apple, but I am a snob and I think I am better than that...okay actually I am just in a different category, not necessarily better, but definitely different.&nbsp; Anyway, I drive up in my little red sporty car, and as I am getting out of my car I notice a guy in his driver seat noticing me.&nbsp; Then I walk through the automatic doors where there are no less than 5 dirty, literally dirty, guys of varying ages in line at the register.&nbsp; As I walked in, all their heads turned my way...I kid you not.&nbsp; It made me grin as I walked through the aisles, even though they weren't the kind of guys that I want to look my way.&nbsp; I know a lot of girls who would still accept this as kind of flattery, and I guess I am one of them.&nbsp; Just enough flattery to get you through a bum-mood day.   But wait, there's more...I purchase my food, and walk out the door, when my mom calls me on my cell.&nbsp; Just as I am starting to talk to her, a guy in a pickup truck filled with yard tools says something to me.&nbsp; At first I thought he was going to maybe ask for some change, but then he said, "Are you married?"&nbsp; My response, "No."&nbsp; He then said, "I might be a little presumptuous, but..." as he pulled out a business card that said something about "Laborer".&nbsp; At the time, still on the phone with my mom and in my own little world, I said to him, "I don't need any help with anything" thinking that he was offering yard work or something.&nbsp; But I was wrong because he said, "Oh, no.&nbsp; I was wondering if I could take you to lunch some time."&nbsp; Still a little out of it, I just said "No, thanks."&nbsp; I then got in my car and drove away.&nbsp; As I talked with my mom on my drive home, it all kind of sank in, and was rather humorous to me.   So writing things that happened is really kind of hard.&nbsp; But if you just take what I wrote and then speed it up, it makes sense.   But why does it happen this way?&nbsp; Why do I get attention from those that I am not only disinterested in, but also don't want attention from.&nbsp; Though it can make me grin, it eventually just makes me pity myself.&nbsp; Thus the direction my writing is taking right now.&nbsp; But I don't want to do the whole woe is me thing.&nbsp; So I will just post this and get on with my life.&nbsp; And still chuckle a little over my Red Apple day.

      I love the reality show  Last Comic Standing !!!!!! I loved it last season, go Dave Mordal! And I love it this season. It is full of good comedy, reality show drama, and a hot guy...who makes me laugh. John Heffron...why don't they make guys like that everywhere. No he's not Mel Gibson hot, that is a fantasy, he is real guy hot. A real guy that could be attainable to a non-showbiz gal. Ah...a girl can dream, right?  Okay, enough of a lonely girl rambling. Last season I was highly disappointed that Dat Phan won. I was tired of his jokes and they were too stereotypical. That is the same reason why I didn't really like Corey Holcom and Terry Pesscatelli (sp?): They rely on their race/culture to get their jokes. We've all heard the ghetto jokes, and we all know the mob jokes...let's move on. That is why I enjoy the comedy of Alonzo, Kathy, Gary, and John: they tell jokes that everyone can laugh with because they relate to the jokes. Jay is funny in his own right; great punchlines, very quick with the puns.  This season had the house fun of Todd Glass. He cracks me up. And he's right, he does resemble Mel Gibson. So there was some tension/humor in the house: Some from Todd, and a lot with ANT. Omigod, I hate ANT. I hated him when he tried out last season, and I hated him so much this season. He's only kind of funny, not enough to outweigh his annoying self.  Last season was a lot funnier in the house. We had Rich Voss ironing incessantly and his "love affair" with Dave Mordal. Then there was Dat Phan, his weird meditation/karate stuff, and the most hilarious moment in all of reality television...Hide and Go Seek. You know, when they left Dat Phan hiding while everyone else was punkin' him.  Anyway, I think the top 3 should be, in this particular order: John, Alonzo, and Gary. But I have a feeling that one of the girls will make it...probably, Tammy because guys think she's hot. Kathy is funny, but she hasn't played the game...at all. I don't think most people get Jay, but he did win the wild card. I think it is kind of like the whole Survivor thing, we want to see the nice guy come through.  So, I will continue to watch  Last Comic Standing , rooting for John Heffron, and hoping for lots of laughs.
