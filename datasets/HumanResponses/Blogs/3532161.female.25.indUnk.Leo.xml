      It is Monday blues.. but this is an interesting one that I have done.. I was supposed to start work at 8am .. but I came in at 9am.. no one calls me up and informed me that I'm late or watever.. nvrmd.. i have to work till 1pm.. sigh.. if I have know.. sigh..   There is a new guy who comes in .. NG Chun Ming.. He is to replace wenbin.. and what a pity that he is leaving..  find it very strange and that we have that many turn over rate and that the management is not doing anything, but recruiting ppl in.. strange management.  later will be going to MC's chalet... and that it is going to be fun.. especially when there is lots of leftovers.. hehehe.. games time. heheheh.   Today. the network at one of the building is down .. and there is some problem with the hydra migration for the India Users.  I'm losing my cool with Eugene.. i hope that I'm able to be a neutral person that will not be based on personal grudges..   continue when I'm back....

      yesterday was a good day.. I had taken only 18 calls.. and to think about the number of calls is already that low.. and today .. best.. have only taken 2 calls and logge 8 calls.. 6 of them are from following up of Matthews' calls.... there is this user.. who had an outlook issue.. that could the CPU utilistion rate to be exceptionally high.. and caused a stalled in the system.. and the best part.. gk had tried many ways to resolve and finding the resolution.. but unable to .. until.. i saw WILL online.. and he is the best.. * mind whoever that is reading this.. I have many BEST ppl around me and I'm not one of them...*grin**  I told him the problem and he can tell me the detailed problem to.. and the great thing is that he was able to do a netmeeting with the user and myself.. and he helped me to *snap* *snap* *snap*... that ***WA LA****  The problem is resolved. Was also trying to call users back for closure and things like that. but either user are not in or not in .. heehehe. wat talking I... hehehe

      WAt a great day to sleep.. i slept till 11am. and that but the time I'm done.. it is time for me to meet my Old Man..went to SuNTec to meet him..thought it is a short time of an hr.. but i get to meet him... NEXT....took GK's cat's mp3 to the service center at Kampong Ampat....best.. reached the service center and waited for an hr for the problem to be resolved.. problem?? Firmware was corrupted and has patched the fireware and upgraded the firmware to version 300.5 .. hahhaha. wat a big num.. how many times have they revised the fireware.. heheheh.. the engineer has done a testing on the player .. and IT IS working fine.. best is that he returned me the player without the battery.. I asked for the battery and the initial engineer returned it to me.. SO they have used their battery to test on it and not on the battery that was in the player....***duh**** thinking if the problem actually lies on the battery or the firmware..hahaha..  i find it pretty dumb..then on the bus. i tried to turn on the player.. IT COULDN'T work.. when i reached home.. i tried the player with my battery and it worked.. when I used the battery that is for the player on my d.radio.. it is not working.. DAMNED.. snooked.. could it be.... the battery problem only????  nevermind abt that.. i called gk. telling him everything.. and he blurzzz.. cos he has tried the battery on his pager..and it worked. .. afterwhich i told my dad abt the battery thingy.. he told me that shouldnt test the battery on the pager.. cos pager requires very minimum power comsumption to get it working..and it cannot be used to do a test for energy for a mp3 player. duh... blurzzz and snooked again..   today I have learnt something new.. in US, they call BMW as BIMMER...   GoiNG to see a show later... with my old man..hehehe be back with another blog later...........

      Yes!!!!! it is almost there. the end of my nite shift fot the month and it is the last time I will be doing nite shift too.. YES!!.. I will be back to the normal human being working hours.. guess it was the off days that has tempted me to work in such an inhumane hours.. wat can I say... I ASKED for IT.... it is okay.. I will be going back to the normal shift.. presumely.. ideally on the 21st June.. but I have informed my manager about is as I will be working on the Saturday before it.. and.. my shift starts on a Sunday and 21st is on Monday. this means that I have to work on Saturday and Sunday.. then Monday - Friday will be normal working hours. this is very tedious.. it is a dying process too.. no matter what. it is still a death sentence..  I still have 2 hrs to go before my shift ends.. counting down.. YES!!!!!!..

      hehehe.. it is a peaceful morning for  tuesday.... I didn't get much calls for the nite shift.. most of the calls are going to Matthew... and emails are crazy.. they are of mails that are of resetting of password for DGS users.. they are so irritating and India indians are so irritating..it is as though we owe them an explaination..... well.. overall it is a good day.. and my "old man" is jealous that gk bought breakfast for me.. and that Christopher offered to buy mac for me in the morning. He wonders why ppl are treating me so well.. and it is not for his case...   when i reached home at 945am... bathed.. slept at 10.. and woke up at 330pm.. sigh.. thinking if it will be a long nite today... anyway today is the last nite shift that I'm going to have..

And it must be during that time, the emails will also come in too.. and there will be something in the team Q too.. what a mess..  but then I have a consolation.. GK bought kuay teow for breakfast.. hehehe. with EGG too. hehhe..  i luv eggs..  When I reached home.. bathed.. slept from 10am to 430pm.. that is long without lunch too. ate 1 slice of bak kua and drank the black honey that my dad prepared... shiok.. and William msged me on MSN asking me if interested in dinner...  rushed rushed,.. left home at 515 pm .. and reached harbourfront at 610pm..  bought titbits for Christopher.. WAH... spent 38 bucks on dinner.. sigh.. got to go on a diet.. spending too much $$$ already..  it is again a busy nite..

      Now for another backlog.. hahahah.. it is a Sunday.. this is better than 5th June.. I slept till 12 noon..till my bum got burnt by the sunshine.. hahahah. aiya, that William called me to look for my "old man".. duh.. still sleeping ler. my "old man" had lesson from 9am to 12nn.. and Christopher and William met up with him at Funan.. That 2 guys went to funan to upgrade their fireware or something like that lah.. They had the cheapest that the funan Food court can offer.. hahahah.. Mee goreng at 3.50 bucks... (0o0).. Called them up and "old Man" cmae to fetch my sis and I.. My sis.. aiya that gal... went to east coast for blading . that is good for her too. if not, she won't be able to enjoy herself that much.. let her be for the time being.. Old Man sent her to east coast and then . we HEADED to EXPO.. gosh. the queue is long.. and the human queue.. but the vehicle queue.. heheheh.. the traffic was heavy..  in the end, we drive back to "old Man" home to park the car and took a bus up 2 stops to EXPO..  It is crowded.. very crowded. and.. "old man" bought thumbdrive for his mum... hmm. will be collecting the $$$ back from his mum... and next is the memory for his fren.. and i bough a box of 100 cds for him at a cost of 34 bucks.. just a little treat won't sting.. We then proceed to the last day of the METRO SALE.. hehhhehhehe. the funny part is that . Christopher and william walked into the hall first and the in charge didn't offer them a shopping bag for putting the merchandise.. hehhe. but the man offerede me and told me that it is the last day of the SALE.. and to make full use of it. heheheh. what an irony. hhehehe  Christopher and william were there laughing .hehehe.. Guess what.. we have only walked for 30 - 45 mins that I have gotten myself 4 items... and my "old man' said it was enough and it's time to make a move.. William and Christopher had decided to buy a mini cooler to be placed in the office.. hhahah. lol.. we shared on the cost.. adnd each of us paid  20 bucks for it.  by the time we make a move it is about 545pm.. and when we reached "old man"'s place, we were so hot and perspiring. "old Man" suggested to go to Airport as it is airconditioned and that I won't be getting headaches. However, my concern is William.. he will have a problem getting home with that 2 pillows and bedsheets that he bought...  so we went to an eating house for dinner. and we had set meal.. that caused 67 bucks after ++..... good spread .. nice nice food. but the only thing is that it is warm and noisy.. caused me to have headaches.... and it was a terrible nite.. i threw up when I reached office.. and all the food wasted.. went down the drain,.  but then the nite wasn't that losy. had 20 odds calls for the nite.  managed to sleep for 1 hr. if not for Chin from t2 called to wake me up.. I would be sleeping more. but nvrmd abt that.

      This is bad. I'm doing the backlogs. okay.. what did I do on the 5th June.. it is a ... SATURDAY.... ooohhh.. that is the day that I lazed around for a long time. i woke up at 11am .. I called my "old man" for lunch... We went to parkway for lunch and I'm a bad gal. he skipped lesson again for me...  and I have re-scheduled my appt for the body massage at Body Contours. We went for a stroll at the shopping mall .. and guess what. we saw my PARENTS.. my dad is okay but my mom.. DAMNED.. she had the blackest face that I have seen for the past months... very unfriendly.. very sickening...  My dad told me to buy drinks from Giants and I acknowledged. Told him that I would buy it. Some how my mind is not working well that day.. cos i remembered my dad saying GUAVA but I took CALAMASI juice instead.. another coincidence, we saw my parents again. and my dad didn't make a fuss out of it and had only said " Ai Ya. It is guava and not calamasi". And my mum had to add somewthing to that comment.. " Told you so many times. What are you doing?" That was it .. I saw RED. and bloody hell.. I am not the only one who listens but do another thing. SHE DOES THAT TOO,, MOST OF THE TIME.. She has no right to say such times at me even though she is my mum.. she can say that to if she DOES NOT make such a mistake.  When we were paying for the drinks, my mum walked over to the cashier and told me that they will be going home by themselves and I have sarcastic to tell her that " We didn't offer to send you back".. she again have a black face.   Well.. The "old man" and I went back to his place..  He bathed while I got myself some shut eyes.. My "old man" looks good in white shirt with dark pants .. Missed out this part.. We were going to attend a wedding dinner.  it is my ex-supervisor's wedding dinner. My "old man" sent me home and waited for me in my room while I was bathing and applying my makeup... it took an hour to do so..   We went to M Hotel at Tanjong Pagar and the recep is different and the whole dinner is different. the opening music for the couple to walk in is so different. it is the new age type of songs and the 2nd walk-in, they sang as they walked in. WOW!!!  Interesting. ..  Had fun and at the end of the dinner. My "old man" sent Gwen to Orchard as she is meeting Edgar there.. My" old man" is very blurzz. He missed the exit for Orchard and had to go 1 big round to get to Orchard and the best part is that CTE was jammed.... took some time to reach destination too.   "old Man" was very tired that nite... poor boy.. When everything has ended, it was near to 2am in the morning,....

      That day... I was lazing the whole day at home... was watching cable tv and playing my game - Emperor:The rise of the middle kingdom... near to evening i was supposed to met up with giapkoon and cheehian for the PC show and I was late.. late for 30 mins. heheheh and the best part, I'm so much closer to the desintation than they are and I was still late. heheheh * grin*  Surprisingly, eilicia was there for the PC show too.. What an honor with her around, she usualy dun go out with us.We had only gotten to walk for an hr and announcements came in informing us that the show will be closing in 15 mins time. My old man came to Expo to fetch us for dinner.  We went to Changi Village for dinner and Angie has gone there to meet us too.  Yeah, we order alot of food..  All of us, except Angie, ate nasi lemak, roti john and satay. We were so full.. and up to the chest..  Next on the line was to thnk of a place to go after dinner.. and some one came up with the idea of going for a show and we did.  We had to squeeze into the car with 4 person at the backseats and me pushed the seat to the front and no allowance at all. Finally... we reached Tampines......Elicia chose to go off and left the 5 of us watching the show. we were at the cinema at 10pm and the show that we have bought was 1230am.. hahahha.. what a long time to pass by.  In the end, the guyz went to Tampines Pavilion for poolz session.. and they played till midnight.. when we reached the cinema again.. we were still early and we waited at the entrance of the cinema and watching trailers. We watched it till it repeats.. hahah.. so pathetic..... While standing infront for the TV screen watching trailer, the aroma of cup corm is still tempting that Angie and I wanted to buy it... but when we got to the snck stall, they informed that there is no more cup corn and left with chickpeas. well.. let's say that Angie has settled for chickpea adn I chose to forsake chickpeas.. heheh  The show, Harry Potter and the prisoner of Askaban, it is pretty dull in the beginning but I became exciting before the mid-show. Overall, the show can be given 4 or out 5 stars... When my old man sent me home it is already 330am adn he reached home abt 4am..  The rest took a cab back from Tampines Mall.... heheh.. what a fruitful day for me......

      sigh... it seems like .. my sis does really write blogs everyday.. without fail.. rain or shine.. she will DEFINITELY write blogs..  but I dun have that time and momentum to do so.. juz like that old man of mine.. doesn't have the patience and be bothered to do it..   well.. think i have to get that time and patience to have these information in the  blog.....  Have just done GK's DB assignment.. and didn't manage to finish it .. cos there are some items that I have no idea what the Qs want and that that the items I didn't recall doing them before.
