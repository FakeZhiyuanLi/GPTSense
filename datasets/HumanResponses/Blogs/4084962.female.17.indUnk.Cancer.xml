      Just watched Brian McFadden's new single and i think he does make good music alone. great voice and accompaniment more rocky and less teeny boppy in style hee hee. less of the boyband kind of thing. more of the rocky side then!  well listen to it when u get a chance  btw, this is me in bot lab a few minutes before we get to drawing all those grasses again. behind me is a ghost... hehe joke! that's my korean friend eun a. she's like a college   best   if u know what i mean...       just an update of what i'm up to... well one thing's i'm back in meditation and self training for reviewing flashbacks and absorbing stuffs like feelings and the like. just saw this vision of a dead man in our bathroom but then the place was still different. trying to orient what i saw i tried looking at some other places in the house. in my lola's room my vision was of a carabao drove by a man (erm tama ba un??) with the same dead person being pulled at the back. i stopped before i got all spooked to sleep anyway.. to be continued!

       Can't breath, can't see   Hands shaking on a cup of tea   Bowed down, can't face   Ashamed of mistakes, avoidance of disgrace      You try but you fail   You always end up before everyone's tail   You're smart some say   But others still can't understand how you play      Mom gives a pat of recognition   Dad, a word of expectation   Building up, it gives too much pressure   All in all, a mind wrecking torture      I try and pray, but end up empty   I strive and want but still stop at pity   I want to live the way they want me   But still end up flunked because of stupidity      To squeeze the eyes shut to stop the tears   You try to share but you have stone peers   Anger builds up in the tightness of your fist   But your smile is still up, mind lost in the abyss      No one knows   None will also listen   Even if you close your eyes, count to ten'   You'll stil live a life that was never really lighten      urgh... i'm a useless ass
