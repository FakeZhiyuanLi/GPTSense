      She walks in the door and the room always brightens Perfect figure, perfect smile - all you can ask for. It amazing how everything changes in the short time That she walks into my life right through that door.   Ok... first few lines there... needs a lot more work but I just wanted to get something up on the new site.  More to come.

      Think about your favorite tree With its roots, branches, and leaves Casting its cool shade over you A place to think and rest for three.  What is it about an old tree That makes us look up and wonder "Why can't I be like that thing Oblivious to even thunder."  Standing there majestically Makes us stop, stand, and stare At the branches and the leaves That are found up high there.  As we stand there looking up, We wish our lives could be  As sturdy and as carefree as That big, old, leafy oak tree.  And so we begin to think again Of choices we could decide to make To make our lives just as good As the tree at the side of the lake.

      She walks in the door and the room always brightens Perfect figure, perfect smile - all you can ask for. It is amazing how everything changes in the short time That she walks into my life right through that door.  She makes your jaw hit the floor as she walks past She is a winner in all ways - point, game, and set You wonder her name but soon enough you will find out She leaves one an impression that you won't soon forget.  Her countenance is pleasant?  I'd say it's beautiful. Those eyes, that smile, that hair - what else can I say? She is smart and beautiful - you almost can't describe She will forever be able to take my breath away.   OK... A little bit more now... I'm going to keep working on this one and see how much I can come up with so more to come. Comment if you want....

      What if we could read minds?  Would we like what we saw?  Think of the people you know,  Your classmate or your ma.  &nbsp;  What about reading our lovers?  What would we find out from them?  Something we didn't want to know  Or that we are "sexy and trim?"  &nbsp;  What about the people at work?  Their thoughts about that guy Bob?  See what our bosses thought  Could we get a better job?  &nbsp;  What about our family?  What would they have to say?  What do they really think  About our work and our play  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Alright this one really needs some work... a couple rhymes are kind of forced and just doesn't flow really well... so more work.

      Does it already show  What they think I have done?  Figuring it all out  Is only half of the fun.  &nbsp;  They dig, they delve, they search,  Lookin' for this clue or that.  But will they discover  The key hid beneath the mat?  &nbsp;  This key unlocks it all;  The secrets to the past.  But what it all means to them  Is what they'll find out last.  &nbsp;  They're searching for an answer  To a question they didn't ask.  Will they like what they find  When they pull off the mask?   This is another one... I might work on it a little more because I think the beginning could use some help... I'll have to see.

      So yes...  I'm going to start publishing more new stuff soon... hopefully as songs, maybe even with some music. On that "note," if any of yall know how I could publish music legibly on this site then tell me, por favor. I was thinking about Internet tablature but then that would be just for guitar unless someone, or me, took the time to translate it to the notes it actually is...  All in all...  Just stating that more new stuff is coming... Sorry to all of you who have actually been reading and waiting... And some new stuff will probably be songs with (fingers  and  toes crossed) music somehow associated.  One whole week left, how fast summer passed...  And one more thing... for those of you who don't know, you can just click the links on the side for the archives to see my old poems and stuff once I start posting more and more things.

      Out of the picture at quarter past nine Ran off as though for the starting line Someone asks me if I'm doing fine... "Please," I ask this acquaintance of mine, "Buy a drink that will do it for me..."  I struggle to down it as I choke back the tears I had been with her for three whole years Then she walked out after firing some jeers. The pain she left me in doesn't ache but sears What I did to deserve this I just don't see.   This is another one from the old site that's just a "part of a whole".  I didn't end up finishing it 'cause I didn't really like how I started.  Anyway there it is.

      As I start to get back in the groove Upon scorched black pavement anew Doing that thing which some may shun, I run and I run and I run  And soon I decide to choose After this day has seemed a rouse, To run hard and think long While listening to some random song  I slowly slip on my running shoes Go out of the house, into the blue. I run to think of what she said Why it happened, what i did...  A piece of a poem from the other site... I didn't finish it and don't plan on writing anymore but it still has some good lines so I figured I'd transfer it.

      Burning passion fills my soul Something I have felt before? Provided by one thing alone, I look and look for more.  How does it do it to me? It drives me straight up the wall Makes me run and run and run To light at the end of the hall.  Will it be the safe-haven? I will see it in my haste. Passion drives me to act in Ways that aren't in good taste.  It drives me away from it Yet pulls me to even stronger. Passion is not a short thing, It often lasts much longer.  Passion for it drives me To reach new highs on high. Then it pulls me down again, The feeling it's all a lie.  Passion is a great love of something, Could be for someone ... sure. Passion's one bad thing is It leaves you aching for more.  There we go... Yet another poem from my first site.  I must say I like this one better than the first two.  Any comments would be great!

      Who tells people what to do? How do we know what's false or true? How does all this affect you? Does your foot fit into the shoe?  Every choice wrapped in a misty shroud. Will you join up with the crowd? Or will you "do the family proud," Or will everyone be wowed?  Why does it always go that way? Hardly anyone has any say. And all seems to go astray. In this "brutal" world that exists today.  Where are we all going? What troubles are we towing? What problems are we showing? Is anyone all-knowing?  The way we walk The way we talk The way we think The way we are Is not the way we should be.  Another poem from the other site that I just got around to transferring.  Didn't revise this one... the original woohoo!

      Don’t understand what they’re doing to me. Why? Why? I just can’t begin to see. The things they say just don’t make sense. I listen and hear but just don’t see why Everything they say just makes me so tense.  Don’t feel like a bad kid, but I guess I am. Am I really as bad as that kid, Sam? They always convince me they think so. What and when is too far to pull? What should I do? I just don’t know.  Wow, what has this life ever done for me? What I’ve done right is hard to see. It just seems to be all work and no play. They ignore and don’t listen to me Why should I listen to what they have to say?  Then again is my life all that bad? They might yell but what luck have I had? Doesn’t that count more than the initial fall? Wait, yes, it is as bad as I thought For I’ve got no good luck at all.  But look at all the people that I know. Kindness and friendship dare they show? It’s a friend I’ve been waiting for all this time, To sooth the hurt and ease the pain. It’s a friend I’ve wanted since before this rhyme.  Will it soon be for the last time? Will it be more sour than a lime? Will I fall down and out again? Will I fall down and out in the end? Will I fall or will someone lend a hand?  Please catch me.  OK. That was one of the first poems I wrote and I hadn't had a chance to copy it over to this site... So there, with a few revisions.
