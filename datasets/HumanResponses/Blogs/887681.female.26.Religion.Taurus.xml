						    urlLink    This page illustrates how to make what I call my "Arrow Purse."  I made it with a tan linen fabric I had leftover from a skirt I made a few years ago.  This purse would sew well in a wide variety of fabrics, but it would be best to choose one without a directional pattern.  And, one with out a "wrong side" would be easiest to work with when cutting out the pieces and sewing them.  I used the same fabric for the lining but found it a bit bulky... if I was to make the purse another time I would use a more light-weight fabric for the lining.  If you have any questions on this project, please email me at dialog[at]briercrest[dott]com .  For more of my projects, please visit  urlLink Michelle's Art and Crafts .

						    urlLink    This is what the pieces looked like before any of them were sewn together.  For a complete purse, you need to cut out 30 pieces.

						    urlLink    I sewed the blocks together in an assembly-line fashion to save time.  I did not clip the thread in between blocks until after I was finished sewing seven blocks.

						    urlLink    When connecting two blocks together it was important to make sure the seams lined up properly.  To ensure this, I pinned through the seam twice.  The blocks on the left are incorrectly pinned because the pink headed pin only went through the seam once.  If you do it this way, you'll have to rip out alot of seams that aren't lined up!

       urlLink     This is the card that I made my Dad from the cats.  He has this "Serta" mattress promotional sheep stuffed animal with a "44" on it, so this is Serta with a blanket thrown over him and a "55" for 55 years.  I scanned this on a white background, the card is actually cut out around the black edge.   urlLink     This shot shows under the sheep's "blanket".

       urlLink     This is the card I made my Dad for his birthday.  I tried out some new mulberry paper, but I didn't like it.  It looks cheap.  The swirls on the sheep I did by dry embossing.  That is when you use a stencil and an embossing tool (a pen-like instrument with a metal ball at the end) and press into the cardstock.

       urlLink    This is a card I made my Mom for Mother's Day this year.  It is made of cardstock except for the green mulberry paper that is directly behind the pansies.  The pansies I made in three layers and accented with purple and yellow chalks.  The pansies and mulberry paper are glued together with white glue, the rest of it is held together with acid-free scrapbooking tape.

       urlLink    I like the way this card turned out, with the red lips matching the red shirt.  But I generally like green and red together anyways.
