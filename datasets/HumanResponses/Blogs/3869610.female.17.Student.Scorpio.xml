         alright, so i just realized that im over that one dude, which is good. Summer is a limted time offer&nbsp;and i dont wont to spend it thinking about just&nbsp;one guy. sure, its fun being boy crazy and all but its alot more fun just kickin it. So im over it.  i got a new cd at target-Autopilot Off.&nbsp;I think its good, not spectacular but not bad. they were really good at warped tour so thats why i bought it. should have bought the new avril cd though, from what i've heard, that girl feels the same stuff i do, i guess its beacuse were both teenage girls or something.  Hahaha, im still grounded. its fun hanging out by myself.ONLY 8 MORE days, whoa....thats a long ass time.

          sup guys, i dont think many people read this bad boy, but whatever its cool, ummm so last nite i went to my next door nieghbors 18th b-day party. her parents got her a beach condo at pajoro dunes. it was really fun, except the kids there werent all that cool. my favorite part of the whole night was sitting on the deck, snuggled up in my blankets, looking for shooting stars and listening to 311's "love song"  all by my lonesome . of course i was thinking about that lame boy named johnny... i think i really like him, it sucks. i talked to him about it last nite and he said that he was too busy to be a good boyfriend but he does like me and wants to hang out and chill. so what should i do? i need some advice, well i mean, duh, im going hang out with him and just be really cool like we are now, but what else can i do? just wait? yea, thats tight...

       alright, heres my first serious entry to my new blog, so yea, my brother is back home from college and hes seriously the biggest gay guy i ever met. i cant wait till he comes out of the closet, that way i wont be the black sheep of the family anymore. it sucks being the bad one out of the group, seriously. im sorry im not perfect, sorry if i get shitty grades or that i like to go out unlike the other 2 loser kids... wtf man wtf. i dont think my parents will ever quite understand where im coming from but whatever... i can handle it.. i hope =/ oh yea, im grounded right now (not really grounded, but i just cant go out) just because i didnt come home on july 4th. i was a little too busy getting intoixicated at my friends house. so my mom freaks out when i lie to her that i was at my nieghbors house, and now i cant go out until july 23rd. thats the day in which my dad gets back from his vacation. thats sooooo long but i dont think my mom can last that long though, i'll break her down hahaha. alright this entry is way tooo long, peace out
