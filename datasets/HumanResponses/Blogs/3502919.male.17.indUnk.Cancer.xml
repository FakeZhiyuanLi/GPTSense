      As the title quite obviously states it is 2 O'Clock in the morning.  The pointless ramblings of a man without sleep...  Anyway, as i have just now finished reading ramblings of a fellow friend i have discovered that dreams are weird and when typing laziness will apply and all mistakes remain.  But most importantly, if the cops ever do intrude on your cocaine snorting, never shove the dollar bill used as a straw up your rectum.  Lessons of life can come in weird places, i have discovered to cherish life, but not by a near death experience; rather by a story of a midget rocking out in vegas.  I know this may all seem confusing, like something out of hunter thompsons head, or the alphabet to Bush, but this will all make sense in time.  Who are all these strange people?  It's crazy how i can be so afraid of a video game, yet still function on a conscious level in pitch black with a chainsaw yielding maniac.  Oh how i wish it would rain.  Me and my friends matt and david have engaged in several hours of who would win in a battle between anakin and luke but the debates have proved inconclusive.  Do you ever have a series of moments where you swear you saw something move but it didn't?  Or maybe felt like the lights in your house kept dimming, but remained static.  Crazy world.  I once counted the amount of dots on a "snow screen" when the cable is out...but that was too complex to be accurate.  On a personal note, when i was 6 my mother told me to never stare at the sun...

      I've been doing a lot of observing, as i have come to know that the world is just doomed.  After reading fast food nation, gearing up for farenheit 9/11, seeing "the day after tomorrow" and hearing a story about a local police force declothing and beating a man to death, i just need to blow of some steam.  First of all, "we've got to fight, take back the night, the cops are like hitler's third reich".  I would highly recommend that the next movie seen by any who read this be the above stated day after tomorrow, it is a reality that if not us, our children, grandchildren, etc will face.  The plot was pretty good, and the graphics were amazing.  Also, i recommend that fast food nation be read, very eye opening book, the modern day equivalent of "the jungle".  So anyway, i believe my ramblings are getting worse.  Delerium definately begins to set in.  What is this all for anyway?  On a personal note my mom finds purchasing a gallon of milk to be difficult. i hate eyes, they're so pointless sometimes.  Good eye, sniper...
