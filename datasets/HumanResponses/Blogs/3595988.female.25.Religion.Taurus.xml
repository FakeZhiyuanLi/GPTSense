      Possible endings to this question in Germany:  1.  Popcorn? (at the movies)  2.  Fries? (some McDonalds... or so I've heard)  3.  Breakfast? (in Bavaria, and usually with white sausage)  4. Spare change? (in the beer vending machine at my student residence.  No kidding.)  5. God? (at church-- after installing a new pastor, at a potluck, during a church council meeting...not to mention the fact that a LOT of beer here seems to have been brewed by monks originally.  Some of it still is.  As Rick Steves says, an Andächser Beer "could almost make celibacy tolerable.")  6. 1 Liter capacity mug? ('Nough said.)  7.  Workout towel? (AT THE GYM.  Does this seem counterproductive to anyone else?)  8. Seat on any public transportation?  9.  German food?  Italian food? Chinese food? Ethiopian food? Korean food? Indian food? Fancy food? Salad? Sushi? Ice cream? (Wait... that was Spain...)   10. 16 years of age?  11. Soda? (Beer mixed with Lemon-Lime soda creates.... the Radler ("one for the bike"). Can we please have a moment of silence in honor of the Radler?  Thank you.)  Any I've missed?  I will miss them all.  One week to go.

      NOT a comic-book-turned-movie spinoff for vegetarians, starring Douglas Fir.  NOT the name of a new character in Ranma 1/2, my favorite (ok, only) Manga indulgence.  NOT a euphemism for a highly painful-looking gymnastic maneuver to be debuted at the Athens Olympics.  But rather, an actual species of potted plant.  One of which currently resides in my room, and has the dubious honor of being the first plant I have kept alive for ten months.  Spidey was a gift from a girl named Susanne when I moved into my student community in Munich.  The only German person I know who speaks English with a Texas accent (having previously lived in, you guessed it, Texas), Susanne showed me her room (aka Greenhouse 3) one night after schnapps, and I left a while later with my new, green, leafy roommate in my arms.  The interesting thing about spider plants is that when kept healthy, they eventually sprout long shoots that drift down towards the floor and then produce branches and new little bundles of plant, looking eerily as though they are growing the arms, and then the outstretched hands they need to pull a Little Shop of Horrors on you in the middle of the night.  But actually, I am told that these "hands" can be planted separately to grow into new plants--like taking and planting cuttings, only without the need for finesse of technique... horticulture for dummies.  Now, because I am a former English major, you can bet there's a metaphor here. I came home one day this week brooding over my time in Germany, wondering what it was for, and whether I can say I made the most of it.  And I saw the spider plant beckoning to me with its three arms (and hey... that looks like the beginning of a fourth!) and thought about how my ordinary potted plant had come to sprout and develop these entirely new THINGS capable of being planted and growing into entirely new plants of their own.  In just ten months.  Of course, the fact that an entire human being can grow from nothing into... an entire human being in LESS time also awes me.  But I don't have a baby; I DO have a spider plant.  So yes, (Simile Alert!) my experience in Germany is like a spider plant. My offshoots?  Learning German.  Living in another culture.  Travel.  New relationships.  New appreciation for home.  New appreciation for beer.  Etc.  Offshoots growing steadily even when they were watered with tears of frustration or homesickness (ooooh, poetic.) I just hope I have the courage to take them with me, find good soil back home where I can plant them and help them grow, branches of a life rooted in the "so far" and reaching into the future.  NOTE: this is still the metaphor.  Carrying actual plant cuttings into the U.S. and then having to bring my gargantuan luggage through the scary customs inspection room = BAD idea.  Which means Finding New Home for Spider Plant goes on the to-do list.  In several senses.

      (waits three beats...) and all that jazz!"  That was me, round about the very beginning of Tuesday, serenading a candle-lit room full of Germans holding blue drinks.  My piano man had started out slow with the opening vamp; the room was hushed and expectant.  I was wearing black, my hair pulled back, tendrils escaping to frame my face as I belted out the first lines with a sly grin.  This is me, I thought: theologian by day, jazz chanteuse by night.  Clark Kent, eat your heart out.  Then, of course, my mind went blank.  "We're gonna mrrphm-smurrrphm bdmmm hmmm... AND ALL THAT JAZZ!"  However, minus that flub and one or two others, the rest of our jazz concert went really well.  "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off" got laughs (Germans generally have an impressive grasp of English) and "The Girl from Ipanema" elicited homesick sighs from the Brasilians in our community, and "Summertime" was positively smoking.  And our specially created drinks, the All That Jazz and the Cö Blues, sold like Nutella*  (*All metaphors adjusted for cultural context.)  The profits of our once-a-month community Bar evenings, incidentally, go toward a children's social program in Uganda.    Our tutor got out his electric guitar and another theologian grabbed her African drum and we jammed... and some of us sat up in "the wee small hours of the morning" singing harmony to all manner of songs, from the Scorpions' "Winds of Change" to... well, let's just say that a surprising percentage of the German population knows all the words to John Denver's "Country Roads."  I dropped into bed happy and sticky at 4am.  Lest anyone think sultry jazz mystique is my usual thing... I rounded out Tuesday evening babysitting for five kids, sliding across a wood floor on my shins while making slurping noises (the official rules of "Killer Snail Tag") in hot pursuit of a toddler who thinks his name is Issy, a princess who thinks Neuschwanstein is her castle, and three 7-year-old monkeys who invent the strangest games I have ever played.  For what it's worth, this is a somewhat more characteristic way for me to spend an evening.  Then again, as I walked across the Isar River to the S-Bahn that night, a passing car whistled at my rear view.  I may be a jazz-singing theologian with occasional memory lapses; I may get ugly bruises on my knees from playing Killer Snail Tag; but I also have a whistle-worthy ass.  Now it's time to write that sermon.

      (clears throat, winces as microphone feedback resonates)  Hello, and welcome to my blog.    I can't give a reason for beginning this blog now, in this way.  An earlier me would have waited and agonized over finding words that dropped and shimmered into place like water on grass in the morning, and I never would have begun. The current me has been living in Germany for nearly ten months now, and has learned that the kind of words that thrill with simplicity and rightness have a time and place.  So do imperfect ones, homely and broken and honest and punctuated by laughter and hand gestures. (And oh, the puddles of imperfection I have stamped gaily in while mucking about in the German language, with 6 different ways to say "the" alone!)  Someone I love once told me that sometimes, the best beginnings are the natural kind, organically grown, without fanfare or hyped-up expectations.  The right words, like weather and grace and surprises, seem to be things that I can best appreciate when I receive them as gifts and don't try to manipulate them.   So here's a gift of words that I treasure, by way of introduction.  They are also, you may note, those from which the title of my blog is drawn:  [i thank You God for most this amazing]  i thank You God for most this amazing day:for the leaping greenly spirits of trees and a blue true dream of sky;and for everything which is natural which is infinite which is yes  (i who have died am alive again today, and this is the sun's birthday;this is the birth day of life and love and wings:and of the gay great happening illimitably earth)  how should tasting touching hearing seeing breathing any-lifted from the no of all nothing-human merely being doubt unimaginably You?  (now the ears of my ears awake and now the eyes of my eyes are opened)  -e. e. cummings
