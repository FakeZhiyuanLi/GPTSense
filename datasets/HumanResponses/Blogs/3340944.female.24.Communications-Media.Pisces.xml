      Guess what? My boss left the country without 'confirming' with my new status. Uh, so I'm technically in the crew, but not quite so. But I know my boss no.2 is being real nice. Got a call from him and I actually received something important which I've been complaining about previously! Woo hoo!   Yeah. So I'm still gonna live with my motto, "Love my job, Hate my colleague."

      I think so. Yeah. I mean I know I've already stepped into the rat race, except that this job doesn't have a racing circuit, everyone just go about their own show, that's EXCEPT me. I don't have my own show yet, because I'm new, I'm co-hosting. And I hate my colleague to the max.  I couldn't do anything, because I love my job. I love doing what I'm doing now, although I'm a full-time university student. Plus, I don't have to worry so much because I'm planning to do my Masters somewhere in 2006, that's one year after I'm donw with my current degree. Uh no I'm not gonna do communication anymore. I'm gonna do human rights, coz I see UN as my long term priority.   Enough about that thing. It's the future. So. OMG it feels like deja vu now... I mean the ambience now... ok. Yeah. I have to accept it: continue complaining, hate my colleague, love my job, hate my typical audience [some race which is rather annoying since they are not English educated and very much typical of them till it can "slower down" your country's growth. They have money, but they (the audience, and majority of them) are stupid and lazy].  Hope you can get which race I'm talking about here. It's like, they have money, but they are so stupid and lazy. They think English is hard to learn, and they are proud of their own stupid mother tongue when no one else in the world even knows this "tongue" actually ever existed. DOH FREAKS. LAZY ASSES.  Alright. You know what? One fine day, when I do get my own slot, I will make sure that they get my message. I don't want them to tune in. I want real people who KNOWS music to tune in. I bet they've never heard of some other English "singing" bands BESIDES Metallica, Nirvana and Scorpion. LOSERS.

      I'm suffocating. I love my job, but I hate my lame colleague. What can I do man? It's literally like this - for as long as she stays in the job, the more listeners will leave, except the minimal sum of typical bikes. And my income depends on it. How? How? How? Tell me! TELL ME??!!!  *lets out a loud, angry sigh*  Just hope that I am still alive when I emerge from the studio later. Save me, oh save me.

      Tonight me and dj molly are supposed to interview this local band act, and... I have assignments to do! It's due Saturday morning and our group is no where near the finishing line. Geez. Talk about part-time job and stuff.   At least I mailed her and made it clear that I have to leave the studio half an hour earlier... *sigh* hate rushing. But it's not my group's fault... I mean, this assignment has loads of stuff to complete and change with... so, blah. Whatever.   Hoping badly that everything will turn out right during the interview session. Coz number one, hey. It's dj molly. how good can things be. You should see the interview questions she lined-up and mailed me. It's so screwed. Grammatical errors, spelling errors, and even questions that make you go like, "the heck does this mean?"  Wishing myself all the best. Really hope that I won't blog a cranky entry for tomorrow's work. Gee. That's like close to an oxymoron. Something like "Indian ethics". Well. *sigh*

      I'm supposed to fill in for dj hoaxer tonight but screw it. Why? Because his co-host is dj molly and in order to lengthen my life a little, even if it's just a little, i'd rather sacrifice one night's interest than co-host a show with her for fear of losing god knows how many minutes of my life.  Again, let me repeat myself. Working with dj molly is worse than mormons anticipating the ultimate apocalypse. Yeah. It's torturing, mind-boggling (in a sadistic way) and painfully nerve-wrecking. It's not that I'm a bad or a mean colleague. Any sane nucleus would feel the way I do. I just hope that my boss will eventually find time and tune in to her voice, her pronunciation and such, and discover that it's because of her that we're losing our listener ratings drastically. Since her co-host dj hoaxer left the show, the ratings dropped even further. He's now co-hosting just one show with her, and I bet he bites his tongue whenever she says something or whenever the thought of working with her comes in mind. Lucky fella. It's my turn now.   Her lines are just oh-so-lame, most of the time, I'm just tongue-tied. What should I say? for snake's sake, I can't even move my bloody train of thoughts whenever she speaks!!! Kryst! Gimme a break! Well. Nothing said is best left unsaid. Think I should shut up now and continue my blabberings in my next post. That'll be tomorrow. I dread the show tomorrow. I seriously dread it. I will only start to love my job, literally, when she's off my back. I'm appreciating the job now, that's all I can say at the moment.

      I needed to get a band into the show. Therefore i need to send out an invitation by email. Gee. And yet I don't have a valid "on-da-job" mail account. I mean, it's not that I need it sooo badly. It's just that, heck. You expect people to come, first you gotta make them believe that it's true!   I can't go around emailing bands asking them to join the show when my email accont is a personal one. It's like, the might go "yeah, right" and send my mail straight to trash. and empty trash right away. Gee.  Work sucks? Not yet. Nope. Soon. And I sincerely hope NOT.

      Did a show today. And guess what! Our listernership rose a LITTLE! And dj molly was so ecstatic! DOH! She's just so duh. We, er, let me rephrase that. SHE decided that we talk about pornography tonight. Which we did. DOH.   Changes... ok. dj kirk told me there'll be a reshuffling in the crew in June. Can't wait for that actually. I hope dj molly leaves. Yeah that's how bad I can be. I mean, she is not helping the show. Not at all. She's driving listeners away, that's what I think. Seriously. No shit.   I will have to submit my ideas or proposal to dj kirk aka my boss no.2 by this Thursday. And originally I thought of doing so like, 30th of May or sthg. Guess I'd have to rush loads of stuff since I have my assignments to deal with. Loads of it! Sigh.  Well. It's all about balancing my priorities now. I know it's impossible to have 2 priorities, but heck. Both means a lot to me. University work and work itself. I need to juggle both at the same time, and wanting or anticipating perfect results. Actually i don't expect perfect results... just satisfaction is good enough. Will see how things go. The most important mission now is to clear up my messy desk. *phew* now that's hard.

      My Friday night show with dj molly paved a tarmac way in my brain that it's time to really tell my boss no.2 about me not being the type that could ever have chemistry with her. serious. her jokes are so lame, it's hard for me to reply to her when she expects some of it. LIVE.   Anyway. I thought of other stuff that could back me up should I decide to tell dj kirk about me going solo. i'm thinking of doing stuff that leads up to the digital video awards as well as our national video awards thing. and since i'm helping out my lecturer with his amateur film starring a local celebrity (deanna yusoff), it's a better bet. i think it's be good.  for your information, we talked about no doubt. how sad. it's like, what the hell? our listeners are online dudes and dudettes, and come on. the stuff which we literally READ though it, was cut and pasted from ND's official webby. they could have done it themselves, and all we need to do was to provide the URL.   my idea, own idea, for my own show, was more towards providing stuff that buzzes users to search for it themselves, that's the point. i mean, it's not gonna be like, what we did for no doubt, the band. it's not like you click on Google's I'm Feeling Lucky and voila! You get it. No. It's like getting loads of info in one shot, compile and deliver it. So it's be more 'useful' instead of reading out something literally from a webby that is ONE click away. i mean, if what we did was soooo friggin simple, then what's the point of having it in the first place? fools.

      Wonder when will I get out of this misery. Honestly. WHEN??! But it's okay. I totally understand that, you know. Tell myself: "hey, it's ok, you're the latest addition to the crew! So chill! Wait for your turn!"  Well. Actually, I really don't mind hosting a show with someone that I could click with. Be it the language, pronunciation, interest, anything. I know it's easy to fake chemistry, but honestly, I tried it again, I almost died in my swivel chair. If I was a balloon, I would have ran out of air the moment she opened her mouth. I know I'm bad, but hey, you want listernership? You gotta speak well and play, you know, universally speaking...  But it's ok. I know it's still too early to demand anything. Give me, say, 3 months? 3 months, and I'll be doing something that's not a prick to one's ears while surfing the net or doing some work. NO Britney, NO Clay Aiken, NO 3 Doors Down, NO Avril, NO Daniel Bedingfield, NO Your Body's A Wonderland song, NO Linkin' Park, NO Creed to name a few.  YES Sade, YES 60s, YES 70s, YES 80s, YES Rakim, YES Remy Shand, YES Alanis Morissette, YES GARBAGE, YES OASIS, YES Marilyn Manson, YES Snoop Dogg, YES Beach Boys, YES Rakim, YES Jackson, YES All Saints, YES New Order, YES house, YES Mazzy Star, YEW Hope Sandoval, YES k.d. lang, YES Jamiroquai and the rest... to name a few...  Tired. Today was worse than last week. Afterall, I know I'll love my job because I'll just enjoy doing it solo. I like going solo. Ask my mom and she'll tell you what kind of independent person I am and how well she knows my wardrobe more than anyone else. Take a look at my wardrobe and you'll know what kind of person I am. A *hint* My favourite colors are brown, orange, black and white. Colors (in general, not just talking clothes here) speak very loud of one's personality. What are yours?

      I asked Fuggy today, if I was to get my own slot one day, and play contemporary adult music, like k.d. lang and stuff, would my boss allow me to do so? Fuggy said why not, coz when the station started broadcasting few months ago, until today, they've sadly, gotten the wrong, unwanted audience to tune in in the first place. which i totally agree with.  I'm going to work soon, and this time, our show (me and dj molly) will be talking on how to gain weight. i mean, what the hell? our listeners are internet savvy and what makes you think that they bother about how to gain weight? common sense tells me our rating tonight will be as low as last week's. geez. anyone could go and check online on how to gain weight. and we don't need to do that. it's not like sthg people want to know, or need to know. it's far away from things like dieting and other suicidal stuff.  I'll be wearing a bullet proof vest tonight as I work. Just in case a bullet travels through the fiber optics and servers and pierce right through my heart. will be back after work. wishing myself luck later.

      Dj kirk just called and asked me to join him at the studio tomorrow at 5 to learn to play with our new toy, a new mixer. which means we will have more stuff and hopefully with the new input, we'd have better output. hmmm.  this would also mean that we could get some local bands into the studio (which is the friday show i'm working in) and play some songs while interviewing them. finally.

      first of all, i ain't new here. i just deleted my old blog. got sick of it. it didn't mean anything. well, yeah, i've just gotten a job, and pretty excited about it.  i just got home from the digital studio, and nope, of course i didn't have my own show. not yet. but it's cool. it's cool. i had to familiarize myself with the clickings and stuff, so i had to join another dj (i'm gonna name her 'dj molly'.   went for a casual interview this afternoon, my future boss. he was aight, an old yuppie i'd say. and another dude, who actually takes care of the djs. he's cool, real nice chap. he's dj kirk. ok. so it was so informal, all the chattin and stuff, and they smoked...sweet... anyway... since my mom might be readin this...   so. i had to ask, like about 30 minutes into the chattin, if i've got the job. my future boss asked me what do i study and stuff etc. etc. so to me it was kinda weird, coz, hey, did i get the job? so as a matter of fact, i did.   so i went on 'air' just now, except that my voice went through fiber optics and servers. it's basically a new station, first in my country. it's new and there's really limited bandwidth (coz it cost a lot in order to have more people tuning in). i had requests, and we had a bit of worldwide audience tuning in, which is nice, since we are new. since i was new.  dj molly had to keep on introducing me to the listeners, and sadly our show was kinda lame. about incubus and nothing but incubus. how sad. tragic. gee. but it was ok i'd say. my mates were listening, and they think that dj sack should be sacked (that's how i got her name here) coz her english was really baddd.... totally. well. not gonna say much coz she's sorta my mentor now.   two hours in the studio (not a conty, coz it ain't terrestial), and that was it. time flies when you're doing a lame show at night. kinda weird. time should be slow if the show is lame but it was my first day on the 'job'... i'm not officially being employed yet coz i'm just fooling around with the computers and stuff, so i'll probably start in june. this is good. i'm just gonna work hard and get my own slot!!! at least i could make some cool line ups. dj molly is boring. she plays boring music, plain, and sadly, erm, her native music. if you wanna know what, you could Y! me. i'll see ya.   I'll be workin again next monday night. so i'll be on 'air' every mondays and fridays. hope it'll turn out aight! cheers to this job. cheers to internet radio.

      I'm actually so immuned to the fact that i hate my colleague that i'm beginning to come to terms with it, which means, i don't hate her that much anymore. The anger died down. I don't know why. Really. Really weird.  Time changes things (though it hasn't change my hatred towards my darling's ex). And it's quite a good thing that it changed my hatred towards my colleague. I mean, now that I'm immuned to hating her, I don't feel like crap anymore. Yeah.   But I still love my job a lot. A lot. Yeah. Even if it's not a full time thingy, it still has my 60-70% commitment in it. Koalalalala!

      I don't understand why people want to be so odd. It's like, Heck?  For example, dj molly. her real name is something like udadu makaya or sthg. And she chages her entire identity on air, and her email. and what. trying to cover up her race when she sucks at it? Not to be a racist here. Not at all. It's just that, if you suck in English and you speak better in Mongolian or sthg, go to a river damn Mongolian station. Get what I mean?   It's like totally off. Totally - off. Well it's okay if she speaks english fluently and not drive listeners away. But heck. Too late. She has already driven a whole crap load of listeners away.   What can I say?  Anyway. I've gotten what I wanted in black and white from the station. The only thing now is getting paid. Yeah. Whatever will be, will be.

      Finally the big boss realized that there ain't sufficient funds channeling through the entire system. Well boss, it's about TIME you moron!   Well. Jobless for the whole of July. But it's normal. I actually like having ups and downs like this. I don't spend much so it's cool. What more, I don't have to see Molly's face ever again1 *weeeeeee* geez i'm so emotional now *jerks*  Well. Let's pop a champagne now, and cheers, to the wonders of the mighty word, 'change'.
