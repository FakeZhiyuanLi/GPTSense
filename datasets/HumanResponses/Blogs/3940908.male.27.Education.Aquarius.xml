      I spent the day with my daughter, Macy, the other day and boy did I learn a lesson. I made plans with my wife to take her out for the day while my wife went shopping and enjoyed some leasure time without her two kids, Macy and I. Being a one cell phone family, we have to flip a coin for the privilege to use it. I lost that day, as I do most times. That is why, in my free time, I'm trying to figure out what cell phone company is offering the best deals for a family plan.  I decided to take Macy to the park and have a picnic lunch. Before I could do that, I had to run by the bank for a deposit. Being an all American dad I didn't bother making a picnic lunch, I knew Burger King would offer us some great choices for our picnic. We took our lunch went to Lilburn Park, which is looking fabulous after all the work they've done in the past year. After lunch we went over to the playground and played for and hour or so. We then went to the public library and spent another hour playing the games on the kids computers, looking for books to check-out and finding some kids videos for the 'Macer.' We then went to Walmart to pick up some odds and ends. After we finished up at Walmart we headed by the house to see if Erin wanted to join us for the pool. She wasn't home so instead of calling, like a responsible adult, I just threw the Diet Coke's in the garage and headed to the pool. We spent almost two hours at the pool and then decided around 5:30 that we better head home soon. When we got home I thought I was going to lose my scalp. I hadn't called or left a note or anything and Erin was about to send the search party out to find our dead, rotting bodies. So now when I say I'm taking Macy for the day, I better not take all day.  How could the same events cause such opposite feelings (emotions)? Joy for Macy and I while Erin had despair. Is it not the same for many other events around us? 9/11 caused dread and fear among Americans while it caused a quite different reaction in other parts of the world. The last Presidential election between President Bush and that other guy. The gay marriages that were happening in San Francisco. The music sharing Internet invention of Napster, and then the lawsuits that followed. A savior dying on a tree in Isreal two thousand years ago. Which side are you on?   Matthew 10:32-35   "Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven. "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn" 'a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law--"

      As I lay my head down to sleep tonight I realize what Jesus said about his followers..."they will know you are Christians by your LOVE." Of course that is the song version I was taught growing up in the church. The apostle John's version says, "by this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another." The morning started with Dad and I bringing a bunch of boxes and other miscellaneous items outside in the turnaround at the end of our drive waiting for some more men to show up to help load the furniture on the moving truck first. We had no way of&nbsp; loading an oak wardrobe, a workbench, or a lay-z-boy couch on the truck. We worked for about 6 hours bringing smaller items that we could carry out the drive before our brothers showed up. Ken, Len, Jonathan and Steve (my favorite brother-in-law) showed up just in time to help move all the furniture on the truck and then help with the jigsaw puzzle we had to put together to fill up the truck with all of my parents items they were bringing to Georgia. These men had worked hard days at their jobs and then came to the aide of my father and mother. That's true love. Where would we be without our community of believers? More tired and sore and NOT DONE PACKING!   What an awesome God we serve and what a wonderful institution we call the church, the body of Christ. Thanks guys for your help.

      This morning my wonderful, fabulous wife was trying to give me an address as I wrote it on an envelope to send in the mail. I was getting so impatient because she was reading slower than I wished her to.&nbsp; I didn't realize how impatient I was until I sat in the Atlanta airport for 3 hours waiting for my plane to take me to Pittsburgh to help my folks move to Atlanta. It was then that I needed extra patience. Patience is such a wonderful fruit of the Spirit. I sometimes forget what a great virtue it is to have. As the plane was heading back to the terminal to unload us to wait for another plane to come in to take us to Pittsburgh I connected the events of the morning with the predicament that I was in. I did not&nbsp;have those feelings I sometimes have when my patience is running thin. It was as if...maybe that's a poor way to say it. It was God knowing I would need to have patience for my long day of travel ahead of me. I felt as if I needed to call my wife right away and apologize for being so impatient with her, not that she could tell I was acting impatiently with her, but I knew I had. After almost five years of marriage, I'm sure she knew. I can't hide my feelings much anymore, she sees right through me. God truly knew what I'd be facing today and gave me an extra measure of patience. Thank you for the safe travel and the chance to help my parents in this way.   God is good, all the time! All the time, God is good!

      That's a title to a Warren Barfield song that hit me last night as I was listening to some new albums. It was past midnight by several hours and I had already tried once to lay down and fall asleep around 1 AM to no avail. This song was the perfect lullaby to help me fall asleep, too bad my three year-old had other plans about her sleep schedule and mine. Here's&nbsp;the chorus&nbsp;of the song.  &nbsp;  Hold me safely in Your arms   And clear my crowded mind   And whisper words of peace   In the dark   Whisper to me   Oh, Whisper    &nbsp; If you haven't picked up his album, do it. He has such a fresh voice and a longing spirit. I got to see him perform "Oh Lord, You're Beautiful", a Keith Green classic, several weeks ago here in Atlanta at the Fox Theatre with several other Christian artists. What a wonderful song, it made me go out and find Warren's album, even though it wasn't even on his album.

      Well folks this is all new to me. I got this idea from my friend and chaplain Jon Owen here at GACS. I don't have any 'deep thoughts' per see at the present time but I wanted to explain my title of this blog, "God Chasers." I'm&nbsp;a huge fan of Christian music and one of my favorites going back to the Spring of 1998 is Andrew Peterson. My absolute favorite song he's written is called 'The Chasing Song.'    &nbsp;   "So, I wish that I could say that at the  close of every day  I was happy with the way that I'm behaving  'Cause Samson chased a woman  And he chased the Philistines  I'm not quite sure what Jonah chased  But I know he caught the sea  And Cain, he chased the harvest  While Abel chased the beasts  David, he chased God's own heart  All I ever seem to chase is me.     &nbsp;   God knows the only time I'm winning    Is when I'm chasing him."     &nbsp;   Praise be to God for his infinite wisdom and his immeasurable grace.   &nbsp; Jeff Harsh

      Ever feel like you are taking some else's glory? I did it this Sunday. At the end of services I got to hold my newest nephew for a while. Oh boy did I enjoy that. It's been a while since my little girl was less than 3 months old, so I took every moment in with my nephew. While I was holding the little guy our Korean congregation came into the main auditorium for a baptism. They sang some songs in Korean and then they all witnessed a new birth of a fellow believer. As they came down the aisle they passed me by and made numerous comments on my nephew. I didn't dare tell them that he didn't belong to me. I just said "thank you" to each kind soul. I didn't think I should make a comment stating that he was actually my brother's baby. I just took all the glory for myself. I had a great big smile on as they all walked by.  That reminds me of how I take God's glory sometimes. He deserves it but I step in and say "thank you." Even though it doesn't come from me, I pose as if it did. The money I  earn  teaching and  I  give back to the church for  it's  work. Not really mine. But I say "you're welcome."  I just smile and say "thank you" when a mom or dad comes to me and tells me what a great time their son or daughter has in class or on the wrestling team. He's given me the talents to teach and coach. When I give my time for a ministry at church, He deserves 24 hours, and I give one.   Lord, give me the desire to serve you with all of my heart, my soul, my mind, and my strength. And help me to give You the glory for what You do in my life. Help me not take it for myself.        Revelation 1:5b-6 "To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father-to him be glory and power for ever and ever!"

      "We were meant to live for so much more." That's a lyric from the phenomenon known as Switchfoot. The band started out in San Diego and continues to make that city its home. I heard about Switchfoot about 5 years ago when I went to see Third Day in concert near my home here in Atlanta. Third Day was, and still is, a great concert band. But Switchfoot really impressed me. Their first three albums had marginal success. Then they signed to Columbia Records and "BOOM!” one of my favorite John Madden phrases, they took off like a rocket. Every time I put it in my player it "feels like the first time." They are now, according to a Rolling Stone interview, a band that is made up of Christian musicians instead of a Christian band. That distinction has helped them in the secular markets enormously. That distinction has helped other bands lately also.  So what do I want to say about the song? 1. Do you believe the phrase? 2. Do you live the phrase?  I believe it, but I know if don't live it like I should. I get caught up with the everyday things in life. I buy into the "more is better" is better philosophy. The rich and famous make me jealous. The cars, the houses, the lifestyle appeal to me. I should rephrase that. They appeal to my sinful nature. But I am a new creation in Christ, the old has gone, the new has come. The hope is that we realize what we were meant for. We see the purpose in our lives. We see the Lord's will winning over our own.  If you haven't heard this song you've probably been in the backwoods on a 2 year retreat from civilization, or you're my dad and you can't stand rock 'n roll. Find yourself a copy of it and BUY IT!

      Here it is again, whether I'm ready or not, here they come. I really get tired of the summer, most years, but this summer was so busy that I was not ready to come back today. We've traveled so much that I didn't get restless and annoy my wife enough to have her ready to get rid of me during the day. Most years she is ready to kick me out. She's happier than the parents of my students when school starts. Listen to me, I'm talking as if I've taught for decades. Well this is my sixth year, and I feel like a veteran. The start of the school year still makes me anxious and nervous though. I didn't sleep well last night and I dreamt all night, both are unusual for me.  God is paving the way for a great school year. He has placed students in my class that don't know the Him and I have a responsibility, no a priveledge, to show them Jesus.  Lord give me strength when I'm weary and give me words when I'm speechless. Give me a heart for all my students everyday, not just the first day. Shine through me, the light of your Son. Thanks for blessing my life with the joy of teaching these young people.

      Fellas, this year was as good as any to be at Promise Keepers. What a wonderful ministry to bring more men into a relationship with Jesus. Friday night 1400 men came forward dedicating their lives to the Lord. I only wish that they continue this week to find a local community of believers that can disciple them and follow the rest of the commands given in the New Testament. That they confess the name of Jesus and follow His example in baptism. That they join a local congregation and find their God-given talents to bring more people into His kingdom.   Joe White  was my favorite again. He spoke last year and I didn't think he could top it. He came close this year. He spoke of the Great Physician, the Divine Surgeon, that has given us a new heart. He has given us a new life. Joe gave biblical examples of men that were given new chances, new hearts; Moses, Abraham, David, Zacchaeus, Peter, Paul, Thomas and the thief on the cross. All of these men were given a new heart by God, evident in scripture. Joe showed clips from  Brian's Song, Antoine Fisher, The Passion , and music video by  Jimmy Wayne  entitled "I Love You This Much."     We need to let go of sin because Jesus has already won. He's gained victory over sin and death. Praise God.  Thank you Lord for bringing Joe to PK in Atlanta to speak to us.    Chris Tomlin  was another highlight for me. He led us in song Friday night. What a wonderful and gifted singer/songwriter. He's one of the best out there, in my book. He sang several off his new album that's due out in stores this fall. Check him out if you haven't already. He's part of the  Passion  movement that has been going on for the past five years. One of my favorite songs, one that I could listen to over and over for hours, is his "Holy is the Lord" which is found on  Passion: Sacred Revolution .   Lord, I ask that You make me the man I was intended to be. The man You created me to be. The man who seeks Your will and Your purpose for my life. The dad that protects his children with love and a covering of prayer. The man who loves his wife the way she needs to be loved. Lord give me the guidance through Your scriptures. Fill me up with You.
