        So the past two days of camp have been uneventful. I really can't remember anything. I was going to take off today, but I figured since one counselor has been absent the whole week and since tonight was suppose to be talent show, the smart thing was to go to work. This morning, I took six of my campers up to the front to work on our banner for talent show. We worked really hard on it, and so far it looks pretty good! I had no clue what the talent show people wanted it to look like, so I took my best guess, and if they don't like it, oh well, they'll live. So yea, after lunch, I was going to take the 6 kids&nbsp;back to the front, but it started to downpour. We had about 100 people under the pavil' (how gangster). It was gross, but the rain was so pretty. I seriously think&nbsp;rain is one of the most beautiful things on earth. I'm serious! So of course, all the kids have to go to the bathroom right in time for it to&nbsp;downpour, so&nbsp;I ran them over to the bathroom, and right when I go into the bathroom for cover, the whole soccer camp is there and wouldn't make room for me. Thanks guys, great way to show sportsmanship! Anyway. we get back, I bought&nbsp;an icee with my brother (which I later gave to Chris&nbsp;because he really really wanted it). Haha, the best quote "You got&nbsp;a vanilla ice? I've never had a vanilla ice before! HAHAHAHA VANILLA ICE! Ice, ice baby!" Haha me and&nbsp;Larisa had a good laugh from that. So, after that, I came home. I tried to make plans with Christie, but we had no clue where we wanted to go, so we ended up not doing anything.&nbsp;Oh well, it was a really calm evening. I watched Wheel of Fortune and Spider-Man. I wanted to watch&nbsp;&nbsp;the Power Rangers Movie (to relive my childhood) but I'm very sad to report that my mother indeed threw&nbsp;it out *tear*.  &nbsp; So tomorow I get to wake up early to go to the DMV. Oh what fun! If anyone wants to do anything tomorrow, let me know. Maybe Six Flags? I'm not so sure. I'm sick of people's cockiness and how they think god hates them because something conflicts with their schedule. Boo frickity hoo, grow up. I'm still waiting for you to ask me how I am. But&nbsp;that's too much to ask...I'm sorry for my existance.&nbsp; So yea. I better go. Bye guys! and comment!&nbsp;&nbsp;

        So, the day ended in a depressing matter. I really need to stop thinking so much. I feel like old friendships are diminishing. Everything I had is diminishing. I just need someone to turn to and tell me everything will be okay. But in my world, that's too much to ask for. Way too much. I mean, certain people are becoming so cocky, to the point when they don't even ask me how I am, or anything in a conversation. That has messed with my emotions so much. Yeah, I'll stop whining now. So I was thinking, the love I had for one person is slowly deteriorating from me, which is a good thing because I can't look at that person in that way.&nbsp; So, yea. Today was interesting. Great Adventure trip, I didn't go on it. Yep. Staff meeting was I guess the highlight. However, thr highlight of the staff meeting was not my powerband-ness, but Stringer coming up to me and handing me a pair of glasses, which were run over by a car. It was "abstract art". Oh, and Chris decided instead of having the "Ultimate Grunge Party" on 90's day, we are having a "Spice World Party" Haha, awesome. I'm going to wear one of my many Spice Girls shirts. So yea, my mom came, we drove Larisa home, we got home, and ate pizza bagels. And here I am now. Okay, that's about it! Buh-bye!

        Hope dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption  Winding in and winding out  The shine of it has caught my eye   And roped me in  So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing  I am captivated   {Chorus}  I am Vindicated  I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  I swear I knew it all along   And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself   So clear  Like the diamond in your ring  Cut to mirror your intentions  Oversized and overwhelmed  The shine of which has caught my eye   And rendered me  So isoloated, so motivated  I am certain now that   {Chorus}   So turn  Up the corners of your lips  Part them and feel my finger tips  Trace the moment, fall forever  Defense is paper thin  Just one touch and I'd be in  Too deep now to ever swim against the current  So let me slip away (3x)  So let me slip against the current  So let me slip away (4x)   {Chorus}   Slight hope  It dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption...         &nbsp;   Ahh, Dashboard Confessional. How I love thee. It's such a pretty song, and even better, it's the theme song to my favorite movie of the summer.      &nbsp;   So, my day? Well, let's see. I ended up going on the swim trip at work in the morning. It was really easy, but the campers were being annoying. I am officially sick of cards! GRRARGHH. So, we get back, eat lunch. OH, but right before we ate lunch, my brother comes running up to me, crying, and shows me that his pants ripped--by his crotch. Thank the lord Tom had an extra pair of shorts and my brother wore them for the rest of the day. I felt bad, I was laughing. I'm such a horrible big sister! So yea. We eat lunch and I bought a green apple/sky blue icee! Yummmm. Then it was time for "mid-summer staff evaluations". I was scared to find out how I did, but Andrea and Chris said that I'm doing absolutely great, so that was a sigh of relief. I was wearing my tank top today, and I had a halter bathingsuit on under it, and this one little brat decides to untie it. I didn't even notice she did it until my bathing suit top was starting to slip. I yelled at her and she said that she didn't know the top was going to do that. GRRR. If she wasn't a 9 year old crybaby, I would open a can of whoopass on her, I swear! She also pulled a whole thing of my hair out because "something" was in it. Let me inform you, that "something" was really just a piece of lint. *insert very mad smiley face* Well, that sums up my day. Stringer told me about Cornerstone yesterday and how he was going to play, and I feel bad I missed it. I wasn't sure if any of my friends were going to go to watch, and no one called me and told me they were (besides the Tropia, but that was like 5 minutes before the thing started). So yea, I hope no one is mad at me or anything. Okay, I'm out! Woot.     -Jen

       So, I haven't been myself lately. I feel like all the emotions I have have been drained out of my body.&nbsp; I'm having problems remembering a lot of things and I've been feeling really weak. My guess is lack of vitamins and protein because all I eat is junk. My mother is getting scared about another issue and wants me to get my blood taken again, I'm sure I'm okay because I was last time, but I'm afraid of what they may do if I'm not. I have to stop being pessimistic, I really do.&nbsp; I feel so guilty venting because I know people have it worse than me, and it makes me feel so incredibly selfish. Yes I really am not as heartless as some of you may think. Here's a weird thought. Most of my friends don't even know the real me. Heck, I don't even know everything about myself. However, one of my friends knows me more than I know myself. It's weird and I'm not sure if this person notices it either. This person has helped me out a lot and I'm sure they don't know how much it means to me, but I really appreciate them. My aunt brought&nbsp;up college yesterday, and which one I want to go to. I really&nbsp;want to go to NYU. If I&nbsp;don't get in, I really don't know what I will&nbsp;do! I want to major in journalism and minor in sociology or tv/movie production (doubt that though because tisch school&nbsp;is hard as hell to get in). I spent my whole day yesterday looking at the website in complete awe. It would be a dream come true if I got in. Starting a new life in the city. Awesome. Then, I thought it over. I&nbsp;started to cry. I do not want to leave my friends when I go to college. I was talking to Tropia last night and she&nbsp;told me something along the lines of "Our friendships are so strong, I can't imagine&nbsp;us not being friends. I mean, look at all of us on Saturday. There was no awkwardness. That just goes to show how close we all are" That helped a lot, thanks Jen!&nbsp;I wish a guy would walk into my life. I'm the type of girl who doesn't fall for a guy easily. It takes time, and I'm extremely picky. Plus no guys are interested. I just hope I can&nbsp;have some type&nbsp;of romance this year. I really&nbsp;do. Well, I'll leave you there. Sorry this&nbsp;was all over the place, I just had to let a few things out in this blog device thing. &nbsp;

       So, my first entry. I doubt I'll write in this ever again, but whatever. I had work today. We went to our rain site, which is Eisenhower. It sucked. I forgot to bring money to order out, so Jen was sad *insert very sad smiley face*. The good thing was that we only had about 30 campers, and with the 10 counselors, there was a 3 to 1 camper to counselor ratio.&nbsp;So that was pretty cool. We watched the Little Rascals, what a stupid movie. I'm sorry, I did&nbsp;not like&nbsp;it at all. &nbsp;Then I did the usual and played cards with the campers. Oh what fun! Then at about 2, we left and went back to the park. A girl started to cry during her MAU game and called everyone at the table a jerk. I wasn't there when it happened, but my campers told me when I came back. I laughed. You'd be surprised how overdramatic 9 year olds are. Then, we walked to buses. Me and Greeney went to clock out and noticed that none other than the devil herself, Jen Alpert, is back. My first thought was that she's replacing Jeremy and it made me mad *insert extremely mad smiley face*. I clocked out, ran to my bus and my bus driver asked me to take a first grader to the bathroom. My feet were in so much pain from walking and I almost started to cry when I was forced out of the bus, in the heat to take this girl to the bathroom. It turns out that she wanted to save an injured cricket on her way to the bathroom. I really didn't understand that at all. I mean, if she wanted to save an injured rabbit, that's understandable. But a cricket? Dude, when I was in first grade, I was terrified of crickets, and if anything, if I saw an injured cricket, I would want someone to kill it. Anyway, the buses started to leave when we got back and I fell asleep on the bus. Now I'm home and all of Ryan's friends are over for his 10th birthday bash. Oh fun, oh fun. I'm gonna go now. Bye.

       So yea.      The start of summer vacation has been what I've expected (with the exception of Monday because Monday was awesome)--absolutely boring. Well, I guess that's what you get for being one of four kids, my mom doesn't like to drag us all out of the house, so since I'm the oldest, I'm always stuck at home watching a few of the kids. *sigh* Whatever.      The past few days, I've found myself laying down in my room, blasting The Early November and Brand New, and trying to drain out things on my mind. I came to the conclusion that Jesse Lacey is a lyrical genius. And that my life really isn't half as bad as I keep on thinking it is.       So, one of my best friend left for vacation today. One of my other best friends is leaving for vacation sooon. Gah, I'm going to become friendless! And before I know it, I will be hopping on the whole train (well, actually an airplane, but you know what I mean) and joining the whole fad in Florida. I'm not sure if I'm excited. To tell you the truth, I'm the total opposite of my family. They're wimps when it comes to rides---heck, my dad has a fear of heights! And if you know me, you know about my lurve for roller coasters and how badly I want to go on Dare Devil Dive at Great Adventure. So, yea. My mom said that she MAY go on the roller coasters with me. This is the same woman who claimed that The Runaway Train almost gave her a heartattack, so I doubt she'll go on any of MY rides. Then James, my "13 year old-Skateboarding-I'm so cool-I think I'm so tough-Simple Plan listening-I claim to hate Yellowcard but I still steal Jen's Ocean Avenue CD-Hypocrite" brother gave me the news that he doesn't want to go on roller coasters. PSSSHHH 8y89hgtjhgn9ognor4hngto. Yea, so I'm contemplating about my trip, and yea, I'm not looking forward to it :\     I'm such an idiot. GAHHH I need someone to talk to. Actually I don't, ahhhh I don't know what I want. Gosh, talk about bipolar. I don't know what's wrong with me.      -Jen

       So, camp is over. It's officially o-v-e-r. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?!? This is the official start to my "summer"! I get to sleep in and hang out with people and YAY!       Yesterday was very bittersweet. Sure, I'm happy I don't have to wake up early anymore and deal with little kids all day, but I'm really going to miss everyone.       I believe my friendships with Kristen and Chris E. grew this summer. And that's definately a great thing! They are two of the most awesome people I know.  We had so many great times, like with Chris and "the thing" and Kristen telling the kids about Sean and such.       ...And then there's the other counselors in my group that I met this year. Chris R, Andrea, Larisa, and Tim.  I remember last year, I only came into my group knowing Dyllan, Matt, and Stephanie and at the end of the year, the only people I got along with were Dyllan, Matt, and Stephanie. This year I thought I was only going to get along with only Kristen, Chris E, and Tom since I knew them before hand and yea, I ended up becoming friends with everyone basically.  Chris R is by far the funniest guy I EVER MET. Even if all of the choices for activities were 4 square or cards, he's still awesome. Andrea worked really hard this year and she's one of the nicest people I know. We had so many laughs, especially the whole "YEAH!" thing. Larisa is actually a really cool person contrary to what everyone says. Oh man, the whole Motel 69 incident, making fun of Brooke, and the MSI CD and other laughs. Haha, good times, good times. Tim is such a funny kid. Oh man, when we had to make sure no one steals the pizza and his attempt at singing the "Move Your Body Girl" song .       Then there's Tom and Brooke. Tom I've known for awhile and he's a cool kid. Brooke I don't really know too well, let's just leave it at that.       I also met some pretty cool CITs this year, like Angela, Scott, Andrew, and Kimmie. They were all so awesome and I hope theyall got asked back! YAY!       The two campers I'm going to miss the most are Patty and Matt, by far. Patty is so funny and Matt is such a sweet kid.       Yesterday was the banquet. I felt kinda miserable there, I felt unwanted and there was some weird vibe around me. The presentation that Andrew made was so funny! Especially when he placed Steve's head on top of Jeremy's (Jeremy quit camp and he appeared a lot in the video, so they just put Steve's face over him) Then awards were given out. Congrats to everyone who got one! You all deserved them! Then, I chilled with Stringer and Sam outside because we didn't want to dance (the whole rest of the crew was) Then, I got picked up early, feeling miserable that camp is over.       I made 150 bucks in tips. Not shabby, last year I made a wapping 40 bucks.       And that's all. Who wants to come to great adventure with me this week?!?!?!      -Jen
