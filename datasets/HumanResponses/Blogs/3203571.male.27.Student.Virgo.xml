      Man what strange dreams I had this morning just before waking up.  I won't bore you with the details, though.    Last night I was remembering what it was like to be a kid and do things.  A commercial I saw while watching Osborne's, but now I can't remember what what it was about or why it...ooohh wait, its coming to me now.....yes....the zack files, that is what I was watching, not osbornes. Anyway, they had this VCR and it was picking up transmissions from outer space.  I remember when I was a kid that I used to tune the AM radio and hear these bidle-bidle-bidle noises, and I would swear that they were UFO's trying to make contact with me.  Of course, I also thought I was getting messages from the past from the Indians that used to live where I lived.  Ohio is full of Indian mounds, and we had one really close to our house.    But back to my story.  I love the feeling of being a kid with no cares in the world.  Its like the cool wind blowing over my body on a nice, warm, sunny day, with your feet in the water and a good book in your hands.    Well, my instructor is about to lock my computer down, so I've got to go....

      Well, yesterday was another day of me feeling annoyed near the end of the day.  Got to figure out what is causing this.  During the day I was fine, though.  Wasn't 'till evening that I started feeling all weird.  But today I feel fine so far (granted, it is only 8:17AM Eastern).  So I drive from Columbus (Hilliard, actually) to Dayton every day that I have class. Traffic moves along about 75 miles an hour until I get to I-75 just south of Dayton.  Then it tends to come to a standstill.  Of course, the fun curves right before the standstill (everyone and thier brother trying to get on 35) are a blast when you've got these big dump trucks going about 80 in a 55 zone.  Don't know who designed that part of the freeway, but it isn't pretty.    Checked out my tuskfish again yesterday.  Seems to be growing new tusks.  Perhaps they are like sharks in that respect.  But instead of hundreds of teeth to replace, they only have four.  My plate coral also died (well, dying), and I should probably take it out, but one can hope that it will spew off spawn (doubt it).  I think I'd like to publish a book.  One of the projects in my photoshop class is to create a book cover. Perhaps that will be the starting point.  Or at least some inspiration.  I'd like to do a coffee table book of some sort.  Something funny, in a morbid sort of way.  Maybe not morbid, but something along those lines.    Well, class is about to start in a few minutes though no teacher is here yet....

      Argh....my tolerance level for things has been dropping greatly.  The littlest things annoy me today.  Been like this all weekend.  Perhaps it is something I've taken or eaten.  Who knows.  I've not been sleeping too very well lately.  Doctor says I probably have sleep apnea and should get to a sleep lab and find out for sure.  Symptoms:  severe headaches upon waking, feeling like I've been hit with a freight train, and I can't think of things any more.  When I say that, I mean that even basic words don't come to mind readily.  I find myself doing things and not knowing I've done them, or forgetting things, or not following directions and not realizing it!  Quite frustrating.  For example, I was working on a project for my camera basics class.  Forgot to shoot something, even though I wrote down that I shot it.  I'm looking at the transparency sheet, wondering why what I saw didn't match up with what I wrote down...until I counted how many of each scene I shot.  Then it started to make sense.  But that one missing shot annoyed me greatly.  I ended up re-shooting the whole project today because of it.  Naturally, the weather refused to give me the same light for each shot, which made bracketing each shot under the same light difficult.  BWARGH!    And to top it off, my back is killing me today.  I've been having these spasms and they've been driving me crazy.  Like lightning going through the middle of my back, from left to right.  And I've been hot.  And my frigging keyboard keeps adding a space before the letter h half the time AND IT IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!  First my mouse, now my keyboard.  You see, my original mouse tail rotted away, and would no longer communicate with my computer.  It was one of those pretty black G4 mice (I use an Apple Mac) with the clear coat over steel sheath underneath the coating....well I guess some liquid got in, and the sheathing started oxidizing, and it turned green.  Then it quit working.  I told people my mouse had gang-green.  So I replaced it with a kensington mouse, one of them five button with scroll wheel jobbies.  Guess what.  The main button (that would be the left button) only works about 70% of the time.  One of these days I'll get around to remapping the buttons.    Last night, I was looking at my fish.  I've got a 75 gallon saltwater setup.  Have this lovely harlequin tuskfish.  Well, I'm looking at  him, and his tusks are missing.  Don't know if this is normal or not.  Will advise.  Writing this evening has been rather therapeutic for me.  Feeling better already.  Even though those voices are yelling at me.  Must fight them off.  Must fight them off....

      Yet more evidence that people who drive Neons should not have licenses, especially if they are girls....  So you know how a four lane road, with two lanes running in either direction....and how you don't turn right from the center lanes, right?  Well, I've got the left turn arrow, and this girl across the intersection facing me decides to turn right in front of me from the center lane.  Doh.  And earlier this week I gave my tuskfish away.  Columbus State Community College has said they want some of my other fish.  Think I'll keep the eel.

      Here I am, sitting in class and trying not to choke to death.   My classmates are making fun of me or looking at me strangely.  Nothing new there.  I was looking for my exit this morning of f the freeway.  Then I realized I had about forty more miles to go.  What a bummer.  Too bad I don't have a Hummer.    Signed up for Advising.    Feel real funny.  At least I feel real!

      Here I am, done with my assignment for the morning.  I'm hungry.  All my corals died while I was away last weekend. Power went out, and no one new about the GFI not coming back on.  At least my fish are still alive.  Did I mention that I got a new job, for a custom candy wrapper company?  Yep.  Busy time of  year, with graduations and all.  Some days I just don' t  feel happy.  Drives me crazy.  Don't want to do anything.  Don't think I'm getting enough sleep.  My eyes are tired all the time.  I love to complain, don't I?  Got a new D70, but haven't had a chance to play with it yet.  Hopefully I will this afternoon.  Looks like a pretty cool toy so far, though.  Man am I craving McDonald's right now.  Like Major League.  But I have to stay away from the fast food, have to stay away....  Can't think of anything else to say, so later!

      After some months of unfettered freedom from the real word, I started working again today.  Just part time, three days a week.  Working for a company that produces custom candy bar labels for just about anything.  Kinda hectic in the small office (I spent all day trying to catch up the paperwork that hasn't been done in the past month or two...another day or two of that and they'll be all caught up, sorta).  Also entered orders from the website....there has to be a way to auto-populate the orders from the website into the filemaker pro software.  Have to work on that.    School is still a blast, doing well so far on all my projects.    Seems as though I went from doing absolutely nothing to being very busy.  Well, busy equals money, so I'll live with it.

      What am I going to do my project on?  This would be a project for Photoshop.  Have to make a poster of some sort.  Movie?  Don't want to do pet food, band, or school poster.  That leaves me with toy.  Toy and Movie.  Movie or Toy.  Need some inspiration.    Here is the last project I did, a book cover:    Perhaps I'll use something from some watercolors I did, basic (very basic) watercolors of bamboo and a fish.     Bamboo     Fish     Scorpion   Maybe some of these images will work for a poster.  Got to have six scanned images and three digital pics taken just for this project.  Frankly, I'm about simplicity, and nine images is a lot, unless I do some text made from the images (that might work)....

      I feel so bleh lately.  Lovin' school, but pretty much not diggin' anything else.  Seems like I've been that way for a while now, huh?    I would like to work for myself.  I find it much more rewarding when I am able to do so.  In a few years, I'd like to have my own photo business.  For now, for instance, I fix other people's computers, and make some decent money doing so.  As a matter of fact, I can make more fixing three computers in one week than I can in two weeks at work.  Makes me want to quit my job (that and the fact that we are so busy right now no one can see straight....I'm afraid my boss is overworking himself), but who's to say that I'll  have any computer jobs in a week?  On my main website,  urlLink SonnyJLewis.com  I have listed all the things I can do for people.  Guess I need to advertise myself more.  Actually, I sometimes wonder if I even want to work at all.  My whole generation seems to have lost the work ethic.  I think we watched our parents overwork themselves, and realized that they only lived to work.  Never take a time out.  No "me" time.  What is up with that?  Consequently, my age group sees work as something that can come and go, kinda like a nice spring breeze.  Or perhaps the people of my generation just haven't found themselves yet.  I'm a college graduate, for crying out loud, and still don't really know what I want to do or what purpose I have being here.  But photography certainly seems to be, for me, the direction I'm heading.  So many of my friends are either unemployed, or return to college to pursue yet another degree, or advanced degree.    Are we jaded?  Or are we just aware that the world really is coming to an end, and see no reason to work?  I've come to the point that I know I'm not right most of the time, and I certainly don't have all the answers.  When I was 20 I did!  But I'd still like to think that I'm insightful, and not a hinderance to society.  Sometimes I feel that I'm living in the confines of a walled, medieval town, sometimes the jester, sometimes the artisan, sometimes the magician.  Sometimes I'm making the pots, sometimes I'm running the town.  Sometimes I'm the pauper, sometimes I'm a royal.  But do I really know who  I am?  Not yet.  Do I need to know?  Some would say yes.  I'm not so sure.    You know, I don't have a clue if anyone reads this blog.  As far as I know, I'm the only one who knows about it.  Just a matter of time, I suppose.  So if you do happen to be reading this, leave me a comment, will ya?     Took this in class this morning, playing around with some gels and cross processing (the XP part in PSCS)  Fed the eel today.  Got a haircut today.  Ate some pizza and white castles.  Not at the same time.   Took a shower.  Spilled water on the couch.  Should not have fallen asleep with large glass of water in hands.

      School is back in session.  Not that you'd know I was out (for a few days) as I never mentioned it before.  Actually, been back going on, four weeks maybe?  Time is flying!  Man have I got a wicked headache.  Been having them alot lately.  Not sure what from.  They are debilitating almost.  Making me smell flowers that aren't there and seeing things I should be seeing kind of headache.  I've also been clenching my jaws more than usual lately; must be under some sort of as-of-yet unidentified stressor.  Whe is it that when I actually make the time to write here, I don't have much to say?  I need a keyboard in the shower, I do some great thinking in there.  And of course at 3:00 AM when I'm just too far on the other side of so tired that I don't really want to get up and start on the computer.  Hurts my eyes anyways at that time of night.  But I could write a whole dissertation on the most trivial of subjects then, no doubt.    Had this fantatsic dream the other night.  I think me and a bunch of other guys were wedding planners (I shutter to think what that would really be like), and we were out in the city.  We go into this nice store.  My sister decides to drive a car backwards, through the front doors and park there, as if she did it every day.  Then we went outside, and next thing I know, I'm sitting on this big couch, that seats seven easily, and it is as if this massive tidal wave came over the city, and here we all are, riding this oversized couch on this killer wave.  Through the city.  Then I drowned (drownd? drownded, no...eh, you know).  And as I was slowly sinking to the bottom, I saw the last bubble of my life float away from me.    I promplty woke up and had to take a massive leak.  Well, I still have a headache.  Worse now than it was when I started writing.  Not that it has been a long time or anything.  Don't you wonder how people like M. Night Shaymalan and J. K. Rowling are able to convey, to put into words and pictures, these gigantic stories, without forgetting what they are doing?  I mean, I'd have to have ten people to remind me what I'm telling and keep me on track, and I'd inevetably go down this winding side trail that really didn't have much to do with the story.  It would take me ages to write down the storys that play for me in my head.  I should really try, though.  I'm sure I'd become wealthy off of them.  OK, that is it. I will write a book.  Stay tuned for more details on this one.  The pain is even worse.  I develeped a roll of Black & White film at home this weekend.  Very easy to do.  I was actually fairly impressed with the results.  Some day I'll post some of them here.    9:50 PM.  Should be getting to bed soon.  Have to wake up at 6:00.  Need my beauty rest.  But I've been restless all day.  I even got orders at work caught up completely.  Like nothing left to do.  Hope we get more while I'm in school tomorrow.  I had being bored at work.  9:51.  Still 80 degrees outside.  Tomorrow will be the last hot day for a few, though.  Only gonna get into the lower 70's for the weekend.    It doesn't matter if anyone else reads these.  I'd of course like to know if anyone did, but it doesn't really matter.  It is nice to go back and see what was happening.  Writing also tends to gel things in my head better than other things.    OK, think I really will go to bed now.  Very thirsty.  Need water and painkillers....
