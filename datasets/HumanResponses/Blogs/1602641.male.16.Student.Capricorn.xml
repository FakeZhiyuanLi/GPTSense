      If you haven't seen Adult Swim, Cartoon Networks not-so-new underground late-night shows, you must.   Here's the rundown: Adult swim features many great shows that were taken off the-air, such as Futurama, and Family Guy.   They also have a heep of original's to offer.   My favorite, The Brak Show, is a spin-off of Space Ghost Coast2Coast, and it is hilarious.   If you value total randomness at all, you will love it.   Next, Aqua Teen Hunger Force.   They aren't really teens, and the show has nothing to do with water, but the rest is true.   It stars Frilock, Meatwad, and Master Shake, it is the ultimate in underground hip-hop humor.   Lastly, and this one may not be on anymore, is Harvey Birdman: Attourney at Law.   It features that weird super-hero dude with the falcon as a lawyer who defends cartoon characters.   Best Episode: Johnny Quest's Custody Hearing(Will he stay with doctor quest or Race Banyon; and what will become of Hajji?) Well that's my rant for the day, check 'em out at  AdultSwim.com

      It's been quite a while since I have commented upon the country's current political landscape, so I'll bet you think I'm gonna start in the most obvious place - that freak show goin' on out in California. Well you know what? I'm not. I'm not even gonna say a single word about it. I consider myself too much of an intellectual to DEGRADE MYSELF by treating it to my UPSCALE COMMENTARY. I will just say one thing on the matter though, and to do so I will quote the great Bill Maher - "It IS absurd that Arnold Schwarzenegger is running for governor. We've just gotten used to it."   In other news, Wesley Clark announced last week that he is officially Democratic contender #10, and that's just fine with me. I, unlike many others, am not perturbed by the fact that the Dems' field is so crowded - debate within the group is the essence of democracy, and is what makes us different from the mindless, non-thinking Republicans. And I honestly don't really care who wins the primary (although I think John Kerry is the most well-rounded candidate and probably has the most serious shot at beating Bush) because I like all of the candidates and believe that Bush is fundamentally weak in every (yes I said EVERY) field. Are we any safer? Hardly. Is the economy any better? The thousands of unemployed in this country don't think so. Have we strengthened our international alliances? HA! Is our government smaller, less intrusive, and more fiscally responsible? Double HA! Have we cracked down on nations that support terrorism? No... Just ask the Saudi royal family. Have we found Osama or Saddam? Nope. But why does Bush still get to go to his campaign fundraisers and make millions of dollars for talking for fifteen minutes while the country is in this shape? Some things in this world are just deeply unfair.  And finally let me reiterate that despite the fact that Bob Ehrlich stood up at his little podium and gave some reassuring words about the flood damage in Maryland, I still loathe him. In fact, I loathe him so much that from here on out, he shall be referred to as Snot Boy. So when I start talkin' about Snot Boy's cockamanie slot machines plan for the state's budget, and Snot Boy getting away with illegally paying campaign volunteers on election day, you know what I mean.

       Hurricane Isabel, or Izzy, as I like to call it, ripped through Washington DC last night.   In the aftermath, trees were downed along with electrical lines, and floods occurred in many areas. The trauma continues, and the story continues to unfold, and luckily I now have power...  Okay, so I was without power for a day.   "Big Deal" you say, but it really made me think about my own, and this nation's reliance on electricity.   Many of you on the Upper East Coast probably realized this in August when NY was shut down for a while, but shut up, I live in DC. Life without my computer, TV, Cable, Internet, PlayStation 2...It was a drag.   All I could do was read and sleep and homework...By candle light!?! Yeah right!?!   So I ventured to a more intriguing venue, the mall.   The fact that the mall has power and I don't just shows you how in the grand puppet show of life, Corporate America holds all the strings...

      Okay so basically here's the run down.   Four people, all dressed alike, run their asses of.   The first guy find the prey, the second two hunt it down like animals and the fourth eats.   Confused?   It gets worse.   If the second two don't get the prey then the fourth gets to eat one third of the the other three. As if that's not bad enough.   The first guy, since he is missing a third of his body cant run his ass off' obviously, so the other two have to carry him around, but since the other two also have a third missing from them they couldn't run either, except the fourth man must choose his area to eat carefully, he should only take the right half from one and the left half from the other.  If however the first three fail for a second time, they cannot be eaten again because that would be death.   So they have to revert to going to white castle.  This is were the original meaning of the word blogging comes from.

      Don't you love it when you hear that a celebrity has given up the good life to visit a third world country?   Bruce Willis recently did so to tour Iraq with his band (I don't really care what their name is; their lead singer is Bruce Willis, so they must be awful) how long is he doing this, you ask.   Not long enough, he's currently at game one of The World Series.   Dedicating his life to the impoverished nation of America, I see...

      First and foremost, let me say thank you to my co-writer Andy for his kind birthday wishes.  Regrettably, the one thing I wanted the most for my special day did not come to pass - some sort of natural disaster that wiped the California electorate into the sea before October 7th. Nope, the Big Man Upstairs couldn't seem to manage it. And now Arnold Schwarzenegger is the freakin' governor of the FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.  But never mind. I have made my peace with it. As Donna Britt said in her Washington Post column, "The people of California will get what they deserve." How right she is. Hehehehehe... The ignorant have sowed the seeds of their own doom. And that's just fine with me - I, for one, voted for the smut peddler.  Or at least I might have.  Anyway, it doesn't matter terribly much - my commentary is just meaningless jabber at this point. I've stopped trying to find any rhyme or reason to anything that occurs anymore. Existence is just a chain of random events that keep the universe from standing completely still. It is nothing more. Justice does not exist. Just ask the Republican Party. They drew the long end of the stick in this sick, twisted carnival that we call life.  Oh, and go see School of Rock. Its heart warming.

        Okay, I just saw this, and frankly, I don't think that it lives up to Tarantino's standards.   Quentin Tarantino, the writer/director of such films as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, at least in my book, is known for his incredible dialogue and plot twists.   Kill Bill, at least in my book, is known for it's incredible blood spurting effect, but don't get me wrong, blood spurting out of every orafice imaginable is great, but after an hour or so, it gets boring. It may be the fact that it is one half a plot, but this movie appeared to have no plot at all, just random killing.   Actually, what I meant to say is that the plot of "Revenge" is very weak in itself and needs something else to hold it up.   As for the spurting, did you know that you could bleed through your eyes?

      Recently, CNN’s own Bob Novak wrote a column which exposed the wife of former ambassador (and Bush administration critic) Joe Wilson as being a CIA employee. Mr. Novak claims that he was given this information by White House officials. THIS IS COMPLETELY ILLEGAL. He also refuses to name his sources - EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE FEDERAL OFFICE HOLDERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED FEDERAL CRIMES- and dismisses criticism of the administration’s actions as plain ol’ ‘Bush-bashing’. Now is this a right wing junta or what?   (Personal note: I’m very excited at the possibility that Karl Rove could potentially go to prison! And not just some cushy, minimum-security country club prison - whupass, rock-breakin’, federal prison. That would be terrific.)

      Michael Jackson creeps me out. Seriously. I know he's a big Democratic fundraiser, and believe me, I fully appreciate every dollar he brings to my party, but I mean come on. That mugshot. I had freakin' nightmares about that thing that he calls a face, AND I AM NOT JOKING. Please, for the love of humanity, put him away. Get him some therapy. And if that head of his can't be repaired, put some kind of mask over it. And somehow affix it to his skin so it can't be removed. Seriously.

      This has been all over the internet lately, and so it should be since it's exciting news. In January, Gibson will launch its next generation digital guitar with onboard microprocessor, this is the first of its kind, and sends sound through an Ethernet cable as opposed to a mono 1/4".   The unit ($3000) will make it possible to isolate the sounds of each string and send them to different channels for mixing, why this is useful is obvious, but why this will make producer's jobs' even more tedious is also. But as with any new digital device, the question remains, can it play breakout?

      Is it just me, or did the cable news coverage of the ball dropping in Times Square seem exceptionally right-leaning? They had Ben Stein talking about how it would be political suicide for the Democrats to act like the capture of Saddam Hussein didn't matter (which, on New Year's Eve, is relevant how exactly?) They had the Amazing Mind Reading Kreskin predict that Bush would win big in '04 (and that it "didn't take a great deal of insight" to know that). They had the damn patriotic music and the God Bless America and Bloomberg hugging that Iraq POW with a tear in his eye and all the revelry and the GLAYVIN. It was like a big rehearsal for the Republican convention. How terribly irritating.  Oh, and didn't you just love what Rep. Chris Shays said about it? Priceless. Just priceless.

      Hahahahaha!!! I have been vindicated! Remember when John Kerry was behind Al Sharpton in the polls??? HAHAHAHAHA!!! Now look at all those stupid Deaniacs who donated all that money only for 0 out of 12 primary wins! They must really wanna SCREAM! HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE!!! Get it!? Scream!? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! (Not that I think that that whole thing was treated even remotely fairly by the media... in fact, Howard Dean's stock went up in my mind afterwards.) No, but really, I'm just gidd. Giddy giddy giddy. As always, I was right. Now EVERYONE is hoppin' on the Kerry bandwagon - but I was there FIRST! And no one can deny it! Just like how I was a New England Patriots fan from the start (remember two years ago, Andy? Remember how everyone told me "Forrest, you do realize they're going to lose, don't you?" Bad officialing, my foot... Vinatieri ALL THE WAY!) And now EVERYONE is a Patriots fan! You know what? I'm a bloody trendsetter! Forget all that polling bulldink, Gallup should just find out what I think.

      As I'm sure all of you have noticed, today is Superbowl XIVXI something or other... Apple, despite their secrecy is in fact running a superbowl ad(not  the recently revamped 1984 Superbowl commercial ), the  new Pepsi-iTunes commercial , an ad for Apple's new 100M free songs promotion. Unfortunately, this Pepsi commercial does not feature the cute little girl or the super-hot girl(Britney) like Pepsi's usual offerings, but instead, recently sued file-swappers. I must admit that this commercial (Set to the song "I Fought The Law" by Green Day) is a very good idea, and should go over well with the masses who will see it today. As for me, time to start hoarding Pepsi.  Does anyone think that New England has inherited the former Rams' Superbowl dynasty?  For any Orwell/Apple fans out there,  check this out .

      Yesterday I finished Dan Brown's  The DaVinci Code . My synopsis: As New York Times Best Sellers go, (acting as if I know what I'm talking about) I found it to be predictably unpredictable. That is, a plot-twist around every corner, and yet I found myself saying "Oh, of course..." far too often. Also, even for conspiracy-fiction I found most of its subject matter to be a bit far-fetched. My latest read, Hollywood Interrupted. Forrest, you would love this book. 'Nuff said. P.S. Let's get started on the top 10 things John Ashcroft said on morphine: Number 10. "Hey, pretty lady...Can I buy you a drink?", to which Ashcroft's surgeon replied "You're not my type..."

      So get this: Outkast suggests that we all "shake it like a Polaroid™ picture!", however, Polaroid™ urges customers to not actually shake their pictures, turns out that the whole shaking Polaroid™ pictures was no more than a fad or urban legend, you pick. I knew this from the start, using a Polaroid™ camera as a child, I noticed that shaking the pictures sometimes caused ugly green stains near the bottom of the print. So my question to the world is: "Does Outkast want us to shake it so it comes out faster, or shake it until it turns green?"

      Fox never fails to surprise me. Though I can hardly say that that is a good thing. Their increasingly twisted concept of "reality" TV is a disgrace to the entertainment industry.  First it was "Temptation Island": hardly the most original idea, but toying with the human psyche is what naturally comes to mind when thinking of reality TV. Then it was that show where several singles were anonymously matched and then challenged to stick it out in a relationship until the big day when they would be married and given one-million dollars. Then it was "The Littlest Groom" where Fox goes further into the exploration of human attraction by seeing who, out of a panel of aesthetically-pleasing women, would choose to date a dwarf. I found that one to be particularly offensive in a number of obvious ways. Then there was "Forever Eden", the show where singles are put in a "paradise", bound to go wrong of course! The only thing wrong with that one is that they would equate a reality TV show to something as sacred as The Bible.  But all of this is nothing compared to what they've done now. Now, further exploiting the science of sexual attraction, they are taking however many "Trailer-Trash" women and, through the miracle of plastic surgery, make them magically "beautiful". Then, pitting them in a "Battle-royale" of sorts with each other in a Miss America Beauty Pageant style competition. I can't even begin to describe what is wrong with this, and more so, cannot describe why it is any worse than the other reality TV shows on Fox.  Oh, and then there's "Joe Millionaire" and "Playing it Straight"...

      This blogger thing is acting weird. Nothing I post comes up on the site until several weeks after I have written it. So when this is read, it will be several weeks from now. Hmmm... intriguing. This is kind of a time capsule - I wonder what interesting details of the here and now I should include in here. Oh! I know... people will soon forget about John Ashcroft's stay in the hospital with a bad case of pancreatitis, and that is as it should be. But let us not forget the delightful notion of John Ashcroft, father of the Patriot Act and grand pisser-on of American civil liberties, being HOPPED UP ON MORPHINE. I mean, just imagine! No disrespect to our distinguished attorney general, but I think that even he would admit that that whole idea is pretty damn funny. He should go on Letterman and do one of those top 10 lists - Best Things John Ashcroft Said While On Morphine. That would be frickin' awesome.

      Okay, I just saw  Return of The King  (belated), the third and god only knows final installment in the LOTR trilogy. First off, that ending was a biotch with a capital B. It finally ended a whopping eleven scenes after I thought that it should have. After the third or fourth ending, I felt like I was being punished for something, or else just being reminded that I'm Peter Jackson's bitch. Otherwise, Golem was awesome, the orc leader boar a striking resemblence to Yoda, and the best part of the movie was undoubtedly when Legolas kills the elephant (It still only counts for 1), second up is when the evil dude catches on fire and runs off the cliff.

        Well, last week I saw  Hellboy . It was sub-par to say the least, but an interesting thought occured to me. Jay Leno pointed out the strange corrolation between the moral degredation of modern society and the Hollywood box office(I can hardly say that I'm suprised...), seeing as how the #1 film has gone from Mel Gibson's  Passion of The Christ , a movie about the prophet of the prodominent religion in this country, to  Dawn of The Dead , a movie about The undead, to perhaps the proverbial bottom of the barrel, at least title-wise,  Hellboy . Jay asked "Is America moving in the right direction?".  Never mind that Hellboy (Ron Pearlman) actually fights for "The Good Guys" in the movie, the undertones speak for themselves, Re-incarnation of The Nazi Regime.  The questions that come to mind are: is America becoming evil? are the finer points of The Christian faith lost on a generation obsessed with killing and pre-marital sex? can you blame them when the icon of our great nation enjoys blowing the crap out of third -world countries for shits and giggles?  This media-frenzy should reach full power right about the time  Kill Bill Vol. 2  is released so all I can say is God bless America...God bless America indeed.

      Watch   Gettysburg   and   Gods And Generals   in sequence. It's fantabulously fun - especially if you're a history geek like me. Everyone should also see the Barry Levinson film   An Everlasting Piece  . It's a comedy about two barbers - one Catholic, one Protestant - who manage to corner the entire wig market in Northern Ireland. Great soundtrack, too.

      I just read excerpts from the diary of Bobby Sands. Powerful stuff, to say the least. No one should ever forget how he and other innocent republican prisoners suffered through the horrors of the H-blocks. Beaten and tortured for purely political reasons - and then called a common criminal by the British government. What a joke.  I post here his entry (translated from Gaelic) of Tuesday, March 17th, 1981 - 17 days into his hunger strike and 49 days before his death:  "St Patrick's Day today and, as usual, nothing noticeable. I was at Mass, my hair cut shorter and much better also. I didn't know the priest who said Mass.   The orderlies were giving out food to all who were returning from Mass. They tried to give me a plate of food. It was put in front of my face but I continued on my way as though nobody was there.   I got a couple of papers today, and as a kind of change the Irish News was there. I'm getting any news from the boys anyway.   I saw one of the doctors this morning, an ill-mannered sort. It tries me. My weight was 57.70 kgs. I had no complaints.   An official was in with me and gave me some lip. He said, 'I see you're reading a short book. It's a good thing it isn't a long one for you won't finish it.'   That's the sort of people they are. Curse them! I don't care. It's been a long day.   I was thinking today about the hunger-strike. People say a lot about the body, but don't trust it. I consider that there is a kind of fight indeed. Firstly the body doesn't accept the lack of food, and it suffers from the temptation of food, and from other aspects which gnaw at it perpetually.   The body fights back sure enough, but at the end of the day everything returns to the primary consideration, that is, the mind. The mind is the most important.   But then where does this proper mentality stem from? Perhaps from one's desire for freedom. It isn't certain that that's where it comes from.   If they aren't able to destroy the desire for freedom, they won't break you. They won't break me because the desire for freedom, and the freedom of the Irish people, is in my heart. The day will dawn when all the people of Ireland will have the desire for freedom to show.   It is then we'll see the rising of the moon."  Thanks to www.eirefirst.com for making this available.

      ...(which, by the way, is on the political situation in Northern Ireland) I found a very relevant William Butler Yeats poem that I really liked. Its about the Easter Rising of 1916, when a band of Irish republicans rebelled against occupying British troops in Dublin, only to be defeated after five days of fierce fighting. This was the catalyst for the popular republican movement in Ireland - that is, the movement for the establishment of a fully free and independent Irish state. I felt it captured the sentiments of the rebellion's leaders quite well.    THE ROSE TREE  "O words are lightly spoken," Said Pearse to Connolly, "Maybe a breath of politic words Has withered our Rose Tree; Or maybe but a wind that blows Across the bitter sea."  "It needs to be but watered," James Connolly replied, "To make the green come out again And spread on every side, And shake the blossom from the bud To be the garden's pride."  "But where can we draw water," Said Pearse to Connolly, "When all the wells are parched away? O plain as plain can be There's nothing but our own red blood Can make a right Rose Tree."

      Andy, just be thankful that that lowly, bedraggled, bastard-boy wasn't you. I, for one, probably would kill myself if I received such a rating.

My favorite possible rating is:   You are a complete and utter BASTARDIZATION of the English tongue!  Unless this is your third language, there is absolutely no excuse for your ignorance. You shame us with your speech. Go back and finish your schooling, bastard.

      I know you're all wondering, so I'll tell you what's pissing me off. What's pissing me off is music videos by pop divas complaining about the paparazzis. Every time I turn on MTV or VH1(I don't too often) I see Britney Spears singing about how she's sick of the media, or Jennifer Lopez with her "Jenny from The Block" music video filmed from the perspective of a voyeur. It's going to happen. It's in the job description. Deal with it. You frickin' babies.

      Quite. Even though the French have surrendered in every major war in history, and personally, I think they should move from the blue red and white flag to an all white one (to save time of course!), maybe we need a little French blood here in America, perhaps with that we would no longer feel it necessary to invade every country on the globe. Just a thought.

      Today, I finally saw Super Size Me, which (in case you don't know) is the hard-hitting new documentary that lambastes the fast food industry. Going in, I was rather skeptical - I have always been a big fast food consumer, and have never worried too much about the impact it would have on my health. I didn't think that some movie would make me change my fatty ways. In fact, out of sheer defiance, I brought in a platter of chicken fingers and curly fries as a snack. (It even had golden honey mustard sauce - yuuummm!)  Needless to say, I was horrified. I watched a guy literally destroy his liver after a mere two weeks on a McDonald's-only diet. I watched him gain 25 pounds over the course of a month. I watched him vomit after attempting to consume a single Super Size fast food meal. I watched doctors tell him that, even if he resumed a perfectly healthy  diet, irrevocable damage had been done to his system.  I also watched some really, really fat guy in Texas undergo a stomach stapling operation. This was rather disgusting, to say the least.  Now, I am changed. No more salty, greasy, deep-fried, factory-processed junk food for me - at least not nearly as much of it. From this day forward, fruit, yogurt, and water will play much bigger roles in my diet than they did previously. But not vegetables. They're gross and they make me gag.

      A couple of days ago House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (a.k.a. The Hammer, Satan's Little Helper) began a speech with "Good afternoon, or as John Kerry might say, bonjour." The room - filled with College Republicans - laughed. It was indicative of how the Republican Party has been getting plenty of mileage out of Senator Kerry's French connections. They love to attack him because he went to boarding school in Europe and is fluent in French. Commerce Secretary Don Evans said "He looks French". He gets criticized for having family in France.  AS THOUGH ALL OF THESE ARE ACTUALLY BAD THINGS.  Look, I have my own problems with the French. I find them overly whiney, emotional, and self-absorbed. But they, like most of Europe, are way, WAY ahead of us when it comes to issues of social progress and international relations. Heaven forbid we should get a president who creates policy based on some kind of global perspective as opposed to the schmuck who we currently have in office, who apparently is unaware that there's a world outside of Crawford, Texas. We should stop distancing ourselves from the French and realize that we can learn a lot from them.   And another thing - just because our position as a global hegemon is being challenged by a united Europe, that doesn't mean we should fear it. After all, the last time the world was split between two major powers (the Cold War), there were no large-scale international conflicts for over fifty years. Plus, there's not a massive ideological gap between the two powers this time. So lets just stop trying to divide Europe and embrace it a little more.

      Pennies are useless, fundamentally worthless, and what's more, quite annoying. Why, I ask, do we, in the age of credit cards and PayPal, still carry around little copper circles in our pocket? Isn't there a better way? And then there is CoinStar, the 9 percent stealing pieces of shit at your local grocery store. 9 percent is an absolutely unacceptable interest rate. If anyone ever charged me 9 percent for something, I would tell them to shove their 9 percent in a special place, yet when faced with pounds and pounds of excess metallic circles, it seems quite reasonable. Why?

Seriously, though, everyone needs to watch Curb Your Enthusiasm. Regularly. Its on HBO on Monday nights at 8:00. And as everybody knows, its not TV. Its HBO.  Another thing - I saw Colonel Sanders on the Metro today! It was really quite entertaining.

      Something really disgusting happened to me yesterday. I was sitting right here, at my computer, happily eating Planters Peanuts, when a terribly sour taste came into my mouth. I grimaced when I realized that one of the peanuts I was chewing was extremely soft and wet. Yep, that's right folks - I ate a rancid peanut! Fortunately, I wasn't traumatized by this incident to the point of never touching peanuts again, unlike my last experience with Vanilla Coke.   Oh, I never shared that story, did I?  It was about two years ago. My house's air conditioner was on the fritz. One night it was about 95 degrees and I woke up in a hot sweat, desperately thirsty. I went to the fridge, pulled out a nice cold Vanilla Coke, and started drinking it down with exceptional gusto. I paused for a second and noticed a number of black specks around the bottle's rim. They were twitching. Upon closer examination, I discovered that these curious little things were - oh joy! - ants. Ants! All over the part of the bottle that I had been furiously sucking at seconds earlier! The filthy lil' mofos had somehow crawled under the cap seal in an effort to reach the sweet sugary nectar inside! I dumped the bottle out into the sink, vomitted, and never so much as touched a Vanilla Coke ever again.

      In Something's Gotta Give, Diane Keaton posed the question (in regard to her distaste for rap music) "How many words can you rhyme with bitch?" Well, I give you an answer (or at least a partial one):  Glitch  Snitch  Itch Rich  Which  Stitch Pitch Kitsch Ditch Niche Witch Hitch Switch Twitch  By my count that's fourteen words - should be plenty of fuel for Fiddy and his cohorts.  Oh, and by the way: Number 7 on the Top Ten Things John Ashcroft Said While On Morphine - (While gazing at TV screen) "Haha. HAhaha. HAhaHahaha.

      I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 on Friday. Needless to say, I enjoyed it a great deal, and am off to see it again tomorrow morning (or rather, later this morning, as I am writing this at around 2:30 a.m.) I'm not going to sit here and try to write a review of it. I certainly am no movie critic, and am not about to try and critique it on its merits as a film. Similarly, I am not some unbiased fact checker who's going to go through every single point the movie makes and confirm or dispute their validity. I am an unabashed, anti-war, anti-Bush, liberal Democrat, and this film was an exhortation for me and all who share my views. Yet this is not to contest the movie's truthfulness - I (not surprisingly) believe virtually every word of it. I fully accept the fact that Michael Moore is preaching to his own choir, and I  admitedly count myself as being among those who take his words for the Gospel. This is not because he's swaying me one way or another, but because he is speaking what I fully, completely believe to be true. If this makes me a fanatic of sorts, then so be it. If this blinds me, and robs me of some other "perspective", then so be it. I don't care. I no longer could give a damn about the intellectual banter, the issue-by-issue analysis, the cerebral commentary that I once held to be so dear. I sit in front of my TV screen every day, watching the horrific pictures that pour out of the Middle East: burnt-out shells of humvees, Iraqi children and American soldiers missing limbs, blindfolded westerners about to be decapitated. I don't want perspective. I want peace.  But who knows? Maybe I'll be proved wrong someday, when Iraq is a (*chortle*) thriving, liberal democracy, abuzz with free market commerce and open political debate, and those missing WMD are found in a hole out in the desert somewhere. Maybe George W. Bush will go down as the heroic leader who stood up for the inherent virtues of democracy when the rest of the world cynically opposed him. Maybe the people like me will be thrown on Ronald Reagan's proverbial ash heap of history, thoroughly discredited along with the communists and isolationists.  But I strongly, strongly doubt it.

      Here's an idea for the Kerry campaign to mull over - choose Ron Reagan as a running mate. He's the liberal, atheist, Seattle-dwelling son of a dead former president idolized by the right. I love this guy. I'm listening to him bash Bush to high heaven on Larry King right now. My favorite quote from him (when Bush was nominated at the Republican convention in 2000):   "The big elephant sitting in the corner is that George W. Bush is simply unqualified for the job... What's his accomplishment? That he's no longer an obnoxious drunk?"  HA! Oh man! That is just fantastic!

      I just got back from Politics and Prose bookstore with my brand-spanking-new copy of Bill Clinton's memoir. It was an absolute mad house. There were more people there than I had ever seen before, and keep in mind I'm including the night when   Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix   was released. Not just could they not fit everyone in the store, they couldn't fit everyone onto the STREET OUTSIDE. The line stretched around the corner of Connecticut and went almost all the way down Ne-bloody-braska Avenue. There I waited for over an hour, in the dark, in the heat, surrounded by my fellow liberals. There was merchandise hocking here, too, this time in the form of charming anti-Bush pins (which I would have gladly bought if not for my lack of cash at the time.) The whole thing involved me standing for long periods of time so now my back hurts. I'm off to lie down now.  Oh, and one more thing - I met Barney Frank! He's one feisty little devil, I'll tell you what.

      So this may be pretty irrelevant, but recently, my friends dragged me along to see 'Mean Girls', which was pretty good. Written by Tina Fey, with plenty of cameos by former and present SNL stars like Tim Meadows, Tina, Amy Pohler, and that other weird woman, I felt pretty at home during the film. My favorite part though, is when a guy presents Cady (Lohan) with a business card that titles him as "Math Enthusiast/Kick Ass MC". I have to make business cards.

      So yesterday I went over to Constitution Avenue to watch Reagan's funeral procession. I was nervous the whole time there that I was going to, in typical Larry David fashion, do something wildly innappropriate, like start singing the Soviet national anthem the moment the casket went past. Fortunately, I was able to conform to the solemnity of the occasion and appreciate it for the historic, momentous event that it was. Yet there was a strange, almost parade-like atmosphere hanging in the air - merchants were hocking Reagan death memorobilia everywhere, jets flew in formation and made big loud noises, the military color guard played patriotic tunes... it was just all very celebretory. While ethically I am strongly opposed to this, I must say I felt quite tempted to get one of those "In Loving Memory" t-shirts. I'm not sure why. I also noticed something strange - this was without a doubt the largest concentration of white people in one place at one time that I have ever seen in DC. It was like a Dukes of Hazard convention.  At present, I'm listening to an old Ronald Reagan movie being played by TCM on one TV and  Air Force One  being played on another. Terrific. Just terrific.  Oh, and congratulations are in order - TO ME! 'CAUSE I'M A SENIOR NOW!!! WOOWOO!!! YEEEEEAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!!! Who be da senior? Forrest be da senior!

      It's a bit of a paradox that people in our society only get recognition for their accomplishements after they [euphemism for dying]. Like seriously, I for one, was under the impression the Ronald Reagan was already dead, he hasn't contributed much to society since he was officially classified as an old fart, unlike Jimmy Carter with the house-building and shit...The fact of the matter is: It's just too hard to keep up the reputations--Either we all have to die or we have to account for the tremendous backlog in recognition to the reformers of the present.

      Whoa. This is really strange. Ronald Reagan's dead. It feels similar to when I heard that Strom Thurmond had died - they had been around for so long, it almost felt as if they were immortal. Well, apparently not. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to listen to U2's   Bullet The Blue Sky   to remind myself of what kind of man he really was. Everybody else should do the same.

      Andy has delegated me to blog about this, so here it goes:  On Monday of last week, Andy and I attempted to implement a plan made days in advance with two of our friends (who we’ll call Lyle and Duane) to go to Ultrazone. But alas! Duane decided for some reason to make himself completely inaccesable all afternoon, not picking up his home phone or cell phone, or responding to IMs. Lyle, while reachable, decided that he had to spend his afternoon studying for the SAT’s. Needless to say, we were quite annoyed, and pissed away several hours playing Red Faction in Andy’s basement. Becoming bored after a while, we decided to check in again with our erstwhile friends and attempt to resuscitate the Ultrazone plan. And voila! Lyle had finished with his SAT prep and was ready to go along with us. Duane, however, was still unreachable, so we decided to just proceed with our plan without him. On the way to Lyle’s house, Andy asked me to call Duane (who lived nearby) in a last-ditch attempt to reach him.   “Hello?”, said a deep male voice on the other end of the line.  “HELLO,” I shouted over the loud road noise outside. “IS THIS DUANE?”  “No, this is [insert Duane’s father’s name here].”  “IS DUANE THERE?”  “I’m not sure,” he responded. “Hold on.”  I informed Andy of the response that I got. He chuckled. A few minutes later, another deep male voice came to the phone. “Hello?”  “HELLO,” I wasn’t sure at this point whether or not I was speaking to Duane or his father. We traded a few hellos before I asked, “IS THIS DUANE?”  “Yes,” he responded.  “THIS IS FORREST. WE’RE ON THE WAY TO YOUR HOUSE. WE’RE TAKING YOU TO ULTRAZONE. WE’LL BE THERE IN A FEW MINUTES.”  “I can’t do it.”  “WHY?”  “I’m hanging out with someone.” I informed Andy of this response.  “Tell him he can bring his friend,” Andy instructed. I did so.  “It’s a lady friend,” Duane said quietly. Again, I told Andy this.  “Who is it?” Andy asked. I (who was by this point only an intermediary between Andy and Duane) conveyed this question.  “Someone,” he said. I told Andy this and he told me to ask him again. I did, and got the same answer. Andy then went on a loud obsenity-laden tirade into the phone that I was pointing in his general direction. I put the phone back to my ear to hear how Duane responded, which was by calling Andy some ass-related thing (possibly an ass-sucker, I’m not really sure.) Andy told me that in order to know how serious it was, he needed to know a cup size. I told Duane best wishes and hung up before he said goodbye. It was hands-down the strangest phone conversation I have ever had. Andy subsequently yelled at me for hanging up before ascertaining the cup size of Duane’s lady friend.  TO BE CONTINUED...

      I'm actually hoping to get over to a theater and see Will Smith's new movie,  I, Robot . I was at first appauled by the thought of Will Smith taking on the lead role in an Isaac Asimov story, but after reading the article in Wired I had a change of heart. I'm interested to see what reflection this movie makes on our society, a society where we have toilets that flush themselves; f.y.i.: I don't like a robot telling me when I'm done.

      We are the richest freakin' country in the world and yet we can't figure out where to build a freakin' city! I mean seriously; look at the evidence: Chicago--too windy Miami--too hot Minneopolis--too cold Seattle--rains too much Pheonix--doesn't rain enough Washington DC--built in a freakin' swamp! Denver--built on a freakin' mountain! San Fransisco--built on a freakin' fault line! Not only that, but what's the deal with some of these names? I mean...Scaggsville...really...I sincerely appologize to all those Scaggsvillians out there that have to write it on their envelopes every day...sucks for you...

      Last night I dreamed that John Kerry had picked Snoop Dogg as his running mate. The funny part of it was that people still preferred him to Cheney.   (A follow-up to yesterday's post - Mike Ditka has mercifully decided not to make a complete and total idiot out of himself by running for the Senate in Illinois. My heart rate can now return to normal...)

      Well, well, well, it sounds like Mike Ditka's probably gonna run for the Senate in Illinois. He would be replacing Jack Ryan (who you may remember had to drop out of the race last month because of a rather bland sex scandal) as the Republican on the ballot. Prior to this development, Democrat Barack Obama was considered the overwhelming favorite in this race. But now, the possibility of a Ditka candidacy makes the whole thing up for grabs.   Now please give me a moment to express my RAW, UNFILTERED RAGE over this UTTER TRAVESTY. I see a new pattern developing - whenever the FRIGGIN' REPUBLICANS are in a race thay can't win, they bring in some BURLY CELEBRITY WITH NO I.Q. OR POLITICAL EXPERIENCE TO WIN THE HEARTS OF THE IGNORANT ELECTORATE. In California, they were starstruck by THE F***IN' GOVERNATOR. Now in Illinois, we'll have all those sports fans swooning over DA CANDIDATE. I swear, if I hear one more of these STUPID, GIMMICKY PLATITUDES, I WILL BURN DOWN THE F***IN' R.N.C.!!! (Well, I probably won't actually do that, but I certainly will send them a poison pen letter!)

      I swear they've done it! Slowly but surely they have infiltrated the deepest realms of our US treasury with their counterfeit pennies! I received yet another from a cashier today and I examined it very closely. It is the EXACT same diameter as a US penny. Now all my gripes aside, I have a serious comment, Dear Canada, Please stop faking our pennies and step off b****! Thank You, US Money Enthusiasts Next order to rant on, those Barbadian quarters! I mean really, they are freakin' identical!

      Forrest has forced me to blog about this...What is a grapefruit? Really... Was the guy who first called it a grapefruit not aware that there was already a grape? That was also a fruit? It just seems redundant to name two fruits that are so clearly not alike with such a blatantly similar name...

      I am thoroughly enraged at the fact that "President" Bush used his valuable radio air time to go on some disgusting schpiel about the f***in' sanctity of marriage. Would somebody please KNOCK SOME SENSE INTO THIS MAN!!!??? Specifically, I'm talkin' to  you , Dick Cheney, Mr. Let's-leave-gay-marriage-to-the-states. But oh yeah, I forgot, you backed off of that position - quite understandable when one takes into consideration your TOTAL LACK OF A SPINE. Urrgh!!!

      Guess who got their Clinton book signed by the Big Man himself yesterday? Yep, it was me!!! I even shook his hand, and said something, too! I can't remember what it was exactly, and was probably so nervous that I butchered it beyond comprehension anyway. Still, it will without a doubt go down as one of those key moments in my life, one that I will look back on wistfully when I am in need of inspiration or motivation. *Sigh*... It was so beautiful. How I wish he were still the president.  And more exciting news - I got the mustard stains out of my t-shirt! Thank you, Clorox pen!

      It's around 2 o'clock in the morning and I am frantically attempting to remove a pair of mustard stains from a t-shirt. This is indescribably annoying. I'm so used to just throwing my clothes in the washing machine, dumping in a cap full of detergent, setting the thing on 'Heavy Soil' and having them pop out clean 45 minutes later. And now, I get these petulent little yellow splotches that just won't come out. I've put them through 4 - count 'em 4 - times, and all I have now are faded yellow splotches. Clorox has, so far, proven useless, though this may just be because I'm applying it incorrectly. I intend to seek the aid of the all-knowing mother in the morning (or rather,  later  in the morning.)  It was fun having a massive, torential storm for the 4th of July. They had to cancel the parade and the concert on the Capitol lawn (though they ultimately decided to go ahead with latter), and they came quite close to cancelling the fireworks, too. There was even some talk of postponing the festivities until the next day. What an Independence Day that would have been - Happy 5th of July, everyone! Heh heh heh...

      Last night I watched the Quentin Tarantino classic  Reservoir Dogs  on Bravo, edited, of course, so that the F-word was deleted. It was truly, unspeakably pathetic. Trying to remove the F-word from  Reservoir Dogs  is analagous to trying to remove Christ from the Bible. The dialogue, once snappy and clever, was made awkward and jerky by the F-word’s absence. Some of the most powerful lines in the movie were reduced to dismal puddles of mediocrity - ( Note: all words in bold type are used by the network to replace the F-word, and asterisks indicate where the F-word was deleted altogether and not replaced with anything)  - for example, Mr.Pink (Steve Buscemi), after being pushed to the ground and repeatedly kicked by Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), pulls out his pistol and yells “You wanna  screw  with me? I’ll show ya who you’re  screwin’  with!” OH PLEASE spare me. And then of course there was the ever-so-memorable part when Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), lying in a pool of his own blood, screams at the whining cop (who admittedly had ample reason to whine, having just had his ear sliced off) “ Poor  you!  Poor  you! I’m * dyin’ here! I’m * dyin’!” How utterly appalling. Curiously enough, though, Bravo didn’t feel it necessary to delete any other naughty words, including “shit” and “asshole”. This strikes me as being extraordinarily stupid. Listen:  Reservoir Dogs  is an incredible movie. If anyone reading this hasn’t seen it, go rent it. Now. Don’t bother with the pitiable rubbish version that the TV networks serve up.   On a related note, Dick Cheney recently told Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) to go f*** himself - on the floor of the United States Senate. What’s more, he refused to apologize for it, and Bush campaign officials ACTUALLY DEFENDED HIM. This from the same gaggle of puritanical jerkwads who vociferously condemned John Kerry for using the F-word in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine. Hey, Bushies! There is a world of difference between Rolling Stone and the U.S. Senate! Why can’t you mean little imps understand this??? It’s not the word that offends me, it’s the overwhelming hypocrisy. Is an ‘I’m sorry for my poor choice of words’ so very hard to manage? I mean, really! Have some actual decency for once!

      Andy didn't do justice to  Collateral 's unbelievably awful ending. It's like the movie just stops as soon as the action-packed climax ends, without any real resolution to anything - for another good example of this, see  Air Force One . Also, Tom Cruise was undoubtedly - at least in my humble opinion - the coolest villain since Keifer Sutherland in  Phone Booth . Jamie Foxx just sort of annoyed me. Best line - Tom Cruise: "I didn't kill him. The bullets and the fall killed him."  Besides this, I also saw  Garden State  yesterday, a dramady featuring Zach Braff (who also wrote and directed it), Peter Sarsgaard, and the lovely Natalie Portman. It had a good story - always poignant and at times riotously funny - as well as great performances from everyone in the cast, including all the canine members (you sort of have to see the movie to understand.) Best line - Zach Braff: "You collect Desert Storm trading cards?"

      Today Forrest and I saw  Collateral . My overall impression is a good one. I think that the director Michael Mann, writer of The Insider (excellent movie with Al Pacino), and accomplished creator of Miami Vice (and notably, the first person to make a Miami Vice credit a good thing--See Ron Pearlman). Jamie Foxx gave a great performance that personally reminded me of his role in the movie  Bait , another great action movie that I quite liked. Tom Cruise was also great, but I don't know how I feel about the grey hair. Yet another movie with an ending that left me seeking more though...I hope that by the end of this summer I can be fulfilled. I'm going to try to get to  The Bourne Supremacy  by the end of this week, meanwhile, everyone should see  Collateral , it definitely lives upto the hype.

      Died today (yesterday) around 9 in the morning of "natural causes". All jokes aside, I do wonder what this "Superfreak"-turned-'80s superstar last words were. Perhaps "I'm choking, bitch!"?

      Unlike the name may suggest, no, America is not invaded by the Manchus, but rather, the Vice Presidential candidate is brainwashed by a copany called Manchurian Global (A subsidary of Google probably...). Anyway, it is probably more of a combination of the two candidates for this coming years' election, Dick Cheney (Brainwashed by Haliburton, scratch that, probably evil to begin with...) and John Kerry ("Mr Kerry! Do you  have dreams about Vietnam!?" "We were brainwashed into suggesting him for the purple heart"). Also very disturbing was the overbearing and undeniably creepy mother (Streep) who's only talent to mention is chewing ice (shudder)... Denzel Washington gave a decent performance, probably the best of a conspiracy theorist since Mel Gibson. Overall, the movie was better than the ending...

      Well, I was watching MTV's coverage of the democratic national convention(well, actually I was trying to watch Pimp My Ride), 3 days after the convention ended. Anyway, to my point, MTV has got to be the only tv station where I can watch John Kerry deliver a speech with eminem playing in the background...ummm...right.......
