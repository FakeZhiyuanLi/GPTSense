						   The jungle.  It's hot. Hard to think straight. The team and I are a sweaty mess. It's been a couple of days since the last posting. Some interesting developments have taken place. Too many write.  Yesterday, we saw what appeared to be a tribal arrest and distribution of justice.  A woman who appeared to be in her 40s, whom we had come to know a bit, was taken in the middle of the night. She was known as the village bean-supplier.  But evidentally a much younger woman had been prepared to take over her job.  What crime she committed is not known, and her exact whereabouts is still a mystery. Though I know not the system of law among this heathen people, I do know by the terrified look in her eyes that some grave injustice had been committed. She is innocent. With silent tears rolling down her cheek, she stared at me as they carried her away. And the entire community gathered in somber attention to see her moved out of the village, locked in a bamboo cage.    A curious and disturbing event indeed; tonight our team will forge our way into the jungle in hopes of tracing their steps and discovering the fate of the innocent-eyed bean lady.  And in the morning, we hope to begin our first presentation of the gospel.  We have now gained the trust of the village elders, we believe, enough to bring the life-changing message of Jesus. How these people, like I only a few short years ago, need their darkened hearts awakened.  Indeed, it is hot.  Time to eat some stew that is freshly prepared. Hot stew on a hot day. Doesn't get much sweatier than this.

						   This is the first entry I am making.  As I write this, I am using my laptop with satellite link from deep inside a jungle in southeast China.  The people here are very primitive.  Most have never seen a white man before. They stare with wonder and amazement at our gadgets, and ask (through our interpreter) why we speak to small boxes by our heads(satellite phones).   It is fascinating to discover their culture and habits. We find it strange the lack of elderly people within their community. It appears no one is over middle age.  Could it be disease or perhaps tribal war prevent most from reaching their golden years? I trust the answers to these and other mysteries will be revealed in the coming weeks.  Though we've only been here for two days now, an eary feeling has descended upon us. My intrepreter just informed me the village elders would like to meet with me and my team now.  more updates to come.... live the journey with me.... through blogspot.com
