      KAMPALA, UGANDA - Ugandian dictator Lt. Gen Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has announced that, although his country will still be part of the so-called  urlLink coalition of the willing , it will end military support for the occupation of Iraq. Uganda, a country which spends a shocking $120 million on its military every year, will withdraw its only troop from the country on June 1. "I feel proud to have represented Uganda in Iraq," said the unidentified soldier, "but my brothers really miss me." Although there was no immediate response from the White House, it is certainly a blow to the already streched-out U.S. military. The troop has not been identified for security purposes.

      ITHACA, NEW YORK -  Presidential Candidate John Kerry announced Thursday that he will accept his nomination for president. The announcement comes after rumors that Kerry may not accept the nomination at the nominating convention surfaced.  Kerry will accept his nomination in a two-hour speech to the delegates, some of whom are already practicing their boredom-management skills. "I tape Kerry's speeches regularly," said one prospective delegate, "because they help me sleep and it's a lot cheaper than the medicine." Kerry's speech will focus on Iraq, the economy, and whatever "letting America be American again" is. All delegates will be supplied with free caffeinated drinks.

      NEW DELHI, INDIA - The government of the United States has announced that it will outsourcing the job of the President of United States to India. "We're paying our president more than $400,000 here," said a government economic, "but there [in India] we can get the job done for around $8." The announcement comes a week after the government announced it will outsource "unskilled" jobs to developing nations. "It's all about helping the poor countries," said Vice-President Cheney. Additional information on the outsourcing will be released after the November elections.

      CRAWFORD, TEXAS -  After claiming that the new leaders of Iraq were "ready to take the training wheels off," President George Bush fell off his bicycle and slightly injured himself. Officials blame Bush's tumble on the soil, which they said was "loose" because it had been raining. However, precipitation records for the area show no sign of rain.  "We will get to the bottom of this," said Bush, "and find the people who did this." Bush did not comment on the Iraqi situation. It is now known whether Bush will put the training wheels back on his bicycle.

      WASHINGTON, D.C. - President Bush has reportedly commented that he may support Ralph Nader in the upcoming election. The unexpected endorsement comes after his political advisors told him that people who vote for Ralph Nader would help his chances of winning by taking votes away from John Kerry. "It's all about political strategy," said one Republican strategist. Surprisingly, reports suggest that Vice President Cheney was not informed before Bush made the comments. While the Republican National Committee refused to comment, some Republican leaders said they were "shocked" by Bush's comments. Ralph Nader has yet to comment.

      ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA -  President Bush announced today that he had accepted CIA Director George Tenet's resignation. Bush commended Tenet for his work, although the CIA failed in 9-11 and Iraq. Tenet said that his decision was not related to politics, but many have suggested that the timing of the action suggests otherwise.   Bush went on to praise Tenet for a "super-duper job" for the country.   Tenet's resignation comes after former Vice-President Al Gore called for exactly that in a firey speech. "I am deeply honored," said Gore, "I feel a sense of accomplishment that I haven't felt since the invented the Internet." Tenet's official resignation letter thanks Gore for his "friendship and candid support." Tenet's resignation will go in effect in mid-June.

      PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA - Representatives of Louisville-based Kentucky Fried Chicken, the world's most popular chicken restaurant chain, announced that their company has refused a plea by the U.S. government to "sponsor" the Iraq war. One representative said that Pentagon officials told him the price tag for the war was getting too high. "They asked us for money," said KFC's Colonel Sanders, "and we made it clear to them that KFC is not interested. We are in business for chicken and chicken only." The Pentagon reportedly offered KFC exclusive rights to build chains in Baghdad, as well as the right to advertise on U.S. military equipment, if KFC accepted the offer. KFC representatives also claimed that the offer included a promise to include KFC foods in all Bush campaign commercials. "We did consider the offer but we decided that it would not serve the interests of KFC worldwide," said KFC's "Chickie" mascot.   Pentagon officials have refused to comment publically. However, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz told journalists privately that the Pentagon was mot happy with KFC's decision. "We are certainly surprised," said Wolfowitz, "but we are determined to find the money we need." The financial troubles for the government come after President George W. Bush used the money to pay for a retirement program for chimpanzees. The White House has so far refused to comment.

      HOWELL, NEW JERSEY -   Local officials recently replaced an old speed limit sign with a new one. The new sign was supposed to show that the speed limit in the residential area is "15 MPH," but actually read "1.5 MPH" after someone put a bolt in the middle of it. Local residents claimed that they noticed several drivers "slam the brakes" as they turned onto the road.  "You couldn't really notice a difference in the older drivers," said one resident, "but when I saw some others I noticed that the sign read the wrong number." Other reidents say that they are shocked that drivers are acutally obeyed the speed limit sigs. Local authorities say that they will replace the sign soon.

      WASHINGTON, D.C. - President George W. Bush announced today that a spot on the infamous "axis of evil" because of the "tremendous success" of the American mission in Iraq. A record seven countries are set to audition for the spot on FOX's new  American Enemy . The auditions will be held before Prime Minister Blair, President Bush, and an unidentified senior CIA official. "We're looking for a member that displays all the qualities of being evil," said a spokesman for the show, "and we hope we find the right candidate." Representatives from Iran and North Korea, both of which are part of the "axis of evil," have so far refused to comment. The White House says it will release more information next month.  Meanwhile, a recently released Pentagon memo hints at future members of the organization. The memo's credibility has been questioned by some, especially after rumors that it listed Sweden and the Republic of Chad as possible candidates. The White House has not officially released any candidates as yet.

      BALTIMORE, MARYLAND - The Retailer's Association of America (RAA) is warning that rising gas prices could have a devastating effect on the gas-powered toothbrush industry. A recently released report says that sales were down from $13,000 to under $2,000 in California alone. "Gas prices are causing consumers to seek more efficient and cheaper alternatives," said Dr. Hall Burten, the president of GasBrush Technologies. The report advises toothbrush companies to seek alternatites such as hydrogen-powered fuel cells and experimental "hybrid" technology. Some companies are already developing such technologies and hope the new products will be availible early next year.  Meanwhile, consumers are not holding back their complaints with the toothbrush companies. "My brush doesn't get good mileage at all," said one customer, "and I am considering getting one of those electric ones."

      LOS ANGELES, ARIZONA - A study released by Oxford University suggests that Americans students did not know basic world geography. The study included more than 35,000 thousand students from a number of states. "Students were not able to answer simple questions," said Prof. Jackson Bills, "even those pretaining to their own country." Howevever, several teachers' unions claim that the study was flawed. "Some students did not get the full alloted time because then arrived late," said one teacher. The students were reportedly unable to find their testing classroom despite hallway signs. Oxford says that it stands by its study.  The study found that 54% of students failed to identify Afghanistan on the map, and a shocking 74% thought Vietnam is an island in the North Atlantic. 3% of students misidentified Canada on the map, however, teachers say that the students simply were not able to find the appropriate bubble to fill in. "We have observed neglect on the part of the schools to teach even the most basic of geography," the study says. Additionally, only 11% of students were able to locate China on the map. This compares to 95% in England, 99% in Egypt, 88% in Russia, and 79% in Mexico. The complete study is to be released Friday.

      DELRAY BEACH, FLORIDA -  Jody Gorran, a Florida millionaire businessman, has sued the Atkins Empire, saying that the company did not warn him over the harmful effects of the diet. "[I was seduced] with a bacon-wraaped cheeseburger," Gorran explained. He says his cholestrol went from 146 to over 200 while he was on the diet. "I came very close to dying, and this is from a diet I thought was marvelous,” said Gorran. When interviewed on FOX News, Gorran was obviously not asked fair questions and the host seemed to have an opinion before he even listened to Gorran. Gorran could be seen whispering "son of a bitch" after being interviewed.  FOX News has not commented on this "fair and balanced" piece of journalism. "FOX certainly makes its guests feel welcomed," joked one reporter. "I saw the interview," said another reporter, "and, boy, he doesn't look fat at all." However, popular Oprah-impersonator Dr. Phil told his audience that people who diet are "cowards" and that the only way to loose weight was to take the "weight loss challenge," while subjucting oneself to severe phycological analysis on national television. Dr. Phil refused to comment on his own weight. The Atkins Empire has not commented yet.

      Fraudcast News will temporarily stop covering news beginning today. This is mainly because I, as the editor, will have other priorities during the summer. I will not be able to dedicate the time needed to come up with and post satirical and fake news.  Look for new postings beginning in the first week of August. I will make a post a week or so before I will start posting.  You still  may  see a few new stories here, but don't count on it.

      WASHINGTON, D.C. - Senate Democrats and a pro-Reagan group, which wants to rename the Pentagon over the recently deceased president, have reportedly reached a compromise. "It's nice to see that Mr. Reagan is still uniting us," said a pro-Reagon demostrator. "We finally agreed," said Senate Minority Leader Tom Dashcle, "and we're renaming it the Reaganagon." The plans for honoring Former President Reagon also include a new jelly bean-shaped state-of-the-art defense reseach facility next to the new Reaganagon. The total costs of the project could exceed $500 million (£274.8 million) according to some analysts.   President Busg said that he "welcomed the news" but a lot of government officials, espeically those who currently work at the "Pentagon," don't share in the pleasure. "We ought not to politicize our military institutions," said one curious observer. "I voted for Reagon both times," said another, "but 'Reaganagon' is just a stupid idea." However, the Pentagon has not officially responded.

      NEWMARKET-ON-FERGUS, IRELAND -  American President George W. Bush stayed at a 16th century castle on a huge private estate. Unfortunately for President Bush, the estate wasn't as private as he thought. Irish television crews report that they caught the President on film while he was changing his clothes. An embarassed Irish government quickly declared that the film was "property of the Irish presidency" and banned it from being used.  When asked about the right of a free press, a White House spokesman dismissed the taping as a violation of the President's privacy. The Department of Homeland security has said that any airing of the tape may be a "treat to our [America's] national security."  "Either you're with us," said an angry President Bush, "or you're going to air the tape." The Irish government has not commented apart from saying that the tape was "tasteless" because of the "cheap Chinese clothes."

       America has once again been put on alert for possible terrorist activity. However, recently released information indicates that the information the government based the hike on is years old. Surprisingly, this little detail was not mentioned when Tom Ridge announced the impending threat. The government made a big mistake here. If they would have announced that this information was not brand new, it would have helped calm the public fear of an attack. The alert was based on a treasure trove of information gathered after   urlLink  Pakistani forces arrested a key al-Qaida suspect   . But what's really weird is that the suspect, who was named as Muhammad Naeem Moor Khan by the U.S., was actually cooperating with Pakistani authorities to capture other al-Qaida militants. Looks like   urlLink  the Americans blew the cover of a Pakistani secret double agent    working undercover to catch the bad guys. What a shame. Maybe the U.S. intelligence needs to work more cooperatively with the Pakistanis.

      FOX television has decided to air old episodes of  Family Guy  for the first time in three years. The channel says it's airing the old episodes, all of which were seleted by show creator Seth MacFarlane, ahead official return of new episodes in 2005.  urlLink The show is set to air in mini-marathons (8-10 PM EST) on August 18th and August 25th . The shows are probably an attempt to grab ratings during the Olympics, which will air on rival NBC in the United States. FOX decided to create new episodes of the show for airing next year after the show's success on Cartoon Network's late night block. The show can also be seen on TBS for an hour a week. FOX will also air a new series called  American Dad , which was created by the same people responsible for  Family Guy ,   starting in 2005. Let's see how the show does in primtime on FOX competing with the Summer Games from Athens.

      The new  urlLink Iraqi government has ordered popular Arabic-language news channel al-Jazeera to shut down its officies  around the country for a month. Al-Jazeera expressed regret on the news, but vowed to continue their coverage of events in Iraq. The government alleged that the channel was "encouraging" attacks on Iraq by outlawed militants and also potraying a bad picture of Iraq to the rest of the world. This seems quite familiar. Actually, this is exactly what Paul Wolfowitz, the U.S. deputy defense secretary, has previously alleged. I don't see how this closing is going to do anything to stop the voilence in Iraq. As for the image of Iraq, what does the current government expect Iraq to be? The "country torn apart by war" image is going to stay with Iraq as long as the country is unstable... al-Jazeera or no al-Jazeera. But the broader question is that of freedom of speech in democracies. Maybe al-Jazeera is mistaken! Do they think they are in America where freedom of speech is exactly that--  freedom ? After all, Iraq isn't a democracy (yet) and doesn't have all the freedoms of the West. As for ordinary Iraqis who currently receive the channel, there are going to be no changes. And since al-Jazeera is a satallite channel, it can still be seen in Iraq.

      Computer hard driver maker Seagate Technology, LLC is going to court to prevent a former employee from going to work for competitor Western Digital Corp. The employee, named Pete Goglia, left Seagate at the end of July after 17 years, and will start is new job on August 16th. The company claims that Goglia knows too much about its technology to go to work for a competitor.  urlLink Seagate is asking the courts to prevent him for working at Western Digital's read and write technology division for two years . Seagate says it is not asking the courts to completely stop Goglia from working at Western Digital. So, is Seagate justified in suspecting that a former employee may reveal the company's trade secrets? It's a complicated question. I'm not sure if there are any laws on the books dealing with this. Actually, as I come to think of it, I am not surprised I have not heard a story like this before. What if KFC started seeking court injunctions to prevent former employees from working at McDonald's or Burger King? Now, that would be internating since the Colonel's secret recepie is something we all value. If I were the judge, which I can assure you I am not the least bit qualified to be, I would look closely at Mr. Goglia's contract and see if he made such an agreement or not. And there's something else that struck me: this guy quit his work on July 30 and got a job offer so soon?  Damn!  Why can't the economy be this kind to the rest of us?    This particular employee, who has been here for a very long time, has extensive knowledge of proprietary and confidential information. We believe he will inevitably disclose some of that proprietary information that he has gained through working at Seagate.   (SEAGATE SPOKESMAN,   urlLink  MacCENTRAL   )

      Conservative political commentator and two-time Republican presidential nominee  urlLink Alan Keyes has announced that he will run against popular Democrat Barak Obama  for an Illinois senate seat. Keyes, who promised "a good fight," is trailing in the polls and has almost no chance of victory. Does Alan Keyes really believe he can bean the star of the democratic convention? The answer is no. The reason Alan Keyes is really running— or atlest  part  of the reason— is to block the charismatic Obama from making rounds around the country campaigning for John Kerry. But, nevertheless, he has a right to run if he so desires. But there's just one little problem: Keyes doesn't actually  live  in Illinois. He's got to move to Illinois in order to be elected. Even Keyes acknowledges he faces an "uphill battle," and according to me, a battle he will probably lose.

      California State Attorney Gen. Bill Lockyer has ordered a chain of California private schools to stop handing out fake diplomas.  urlLink The schools taught that there were 53 states in the U.S. and 4 branches of government , and were geared towards recent immigrants with some or no knowledge of the issues. The company, which had 30 schools statewide, charged its mainly Latino immigrant students from $450 to $1450 for so-called high school diplomas. The course was based around a book riddled with factual errors.    Students learned that Congress had two houses -- the Senate for Democrats and the House for Republicans; that the U.S. flag had not been updated to reflect the addition of Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico to the "original" 50 states; that the federal "administrative" branch oversees the Treasury Department and that World War II occurred from 1938 to 1942.

      Ever since George W. Bush has been in the public eye, and especially since he became President, he has managed to misspeak time and time again. Somtimes calling Africa "a great nation," or otherwise butchering the English language in general, he has always managed to make it a field day for the late night comics and the like. Well, this time when President Bush inagurated another of of his "bushims" he sparked a firestorm of laughter. What he said was so "out there" that it made Jay Leno's monolouge in  The Tonight Show . I'll let you judge yourself:    Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people,  and neither do we .   (GEORGE W. BUSH,  urlLink WHITE HOUSE )      So, besides creating the next political ad for your rival, what could be  more  embarassing? If the quote is still up on your website! Yes, as of today  urlLink the quote is still up on the White House's official website . And all this after it's made the late night comedy shows. You know, Kerry should just sit back and relax from now on and let President Bush do all his campaigning.

      The Keyes-Obama Illinois senatorial race is getting a little more wierd.  urlLink A napkin Keyes used to wipe off his forehead in his acceptance speech has been put up for sale on eBay . The current owner of the napkin, who claims to be a supporter, says he will donate the proceeds from the sale to the Keyes for Senate campaign. As of 5:45 PM (EST), bidding was already up to $520. The seller has said that he may choose to stop bidding at $999.99 to bypass some Federal Election Campaign laws that call for the creating of a political fundraising committee. Although some may consider the seller a little weird to be offer such a product, I want to know who would want to pay any amount of money, set aside the $520, to buy some politician's sweat-soaked napkin! Maybe it's because of the free shipping the seller's offering, or maybe its just proof that some people have more money they know what to do with. The proceeds of the sale would be better spent if they were donated to a charity or other such organization, not a politician.

      Now you don't have a drive to your local Blockbuster store to rent your favorite DVDs.  urlLink The video rental chain is set to begin its Blockbuster Online service, which will allow customers to rent DVDs online  and receive them through mail for a monthly fee. Additionally, subscribing customers will get two free DVD rentals the old fashioned way. Customers can have upto three DVDs at a time with no late fees and no due dates for $20 a month. The move comes after the success of internet DVD rental store Netflix, which offers the service for $22 a month. Although Netflix claims it is superior because of its next-day home delivery, it will be interesting to see now Blockbuster's "world's largest DVD rental service" status affects its new online venture. The service is certainly a savings opportunity for those who rent frequently, otherwise it may be better to just drive to the store. Both Netflix and Blockbuster are offering free trials of their service.
