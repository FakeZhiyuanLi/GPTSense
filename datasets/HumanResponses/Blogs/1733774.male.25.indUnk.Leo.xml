       urlLink     What Color is Your Brain?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    If you haven't figured it out by now...this is my temporary home.   urlLink http//journal.9thelement.com  is under MAJOR reconstruction.  So hopefully it will be back soon,  I'll keep you posted:    I have seriously neglected my blog...I'm surprised I remembered how to log-in.  I can say the events of the past month and some change will definitely require an entire section in my autobiography.  Hell it might even get its on separate volume if I could remember most of it...All one entire blur. A straight adrenaline rush...A climax...And well you know what happens after a climax.      So I'm here still left with unanswered questions...Some I don't wish to know the answers to.  I know that I have learned a great deal about myself in this short period...Like participating in a strong man competition learning that towing 3 buses with your teeth is your limit.  I was taught lessons that I will forever be in debt for being privy to them.      Life has its strange way about it...Like see something...Smelling something that is familiar to a memory deep in your mind.  Only to see that it was a message wrapped in a package it knew you would open.  A message you avoided like a bill collector...But the collector was on your front door step.  Now that the realization has set in...What next?      I never thought in a million years that I would ever experience something in my life that I wouldn't trade for anything in the world.  Yet I have, while I was on this joy ride knowing reality's brick wall is a half mile ahead...And I have no concept of brakes.  I ask myself why at this point in my life do I experience this great thing to only know that it can be taken away at any moment.  Why did I hide from the truth that wasn't hiding from me?    Was this past month just a wake up call of some sorts?  Was it a preview of great things to come...Only if I conquer my fears?  Was it the answer to some deep subconscious inquiry about the purpose of my life...Better yet...My fate?  I know this for a fact, what ever religion you may or may not practice...There is a higher power at hand and it works in mysterious ways.  It sends signs all the time until it finds the right one you pay attention to.  Luckily for me I was paying attention this particular cycle in my life.   PS-Did you miss me?

      Yes it has been a minute since I posted...More Millions of them but who's counting.&nbsp; Hell I don't even know if anyone is reading this...am I really typing this...is this&nbsp;a dream...not likely, I'm a work and I tried pinching myself already.&nbsp; Well I guess I'll start with a recap of the last month or so...or maybe I won't...because the stupid "Enter" key is not working properly and&nbsp;it is making my head hurt...&nbsp;  ---Love Lost or was it:&nbsp; Well as recently as a week ago I came to a mutual agreement to end a relationship.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;a very amicable ending, peaceful...no&nbsp;cussing and&nbsp;no damning future children...we&nbsp;actually wish&nbsp;each other well in the future.&nbsp; Not to say everytime I end a relationship its like stepping into a street fight, but it must of been the calmess situation I can remember, like getting&nbsp;check...not for a million dollars...more like a hundred dollars, but yet appreiated.&nbsp; Not to say&nbsp;there was nothing there...there was but it wasn't quite right...and gut feelings rule above all feelings (including the one you have when you got to take a piss and you&nbsp;just got on the train).&nbsp; So now once again I'm back at square one. Single...no kids...damn...I guess it can't be all that bad right?!?!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I have no idea what the hell I feel like writing about...not a a clue.  I'm just sitting here counting down the days until my vacation.  Where am I going you ask?  Some Caribbean Island...no.  Some European country...no.  North Carolina...What!!!  Other plans for my summer vacation were cancelled due to unnamed parties.    So I'm hitting I-95 & I-85 South...to the Durty...that's right I said D-u-r-t-y.  Anyway...this trip I have a co-pilot, "Nichole" is coming (consealing last name because stories that I may have when we get back...want to make sure she is still employable).  She hasn't been down south before, (Atlanta and Miami don't count) so damn is she in for a culture shock.  I'll try and spare her the experience of Strip Clubs in the Backwoods (experienced for the first time in September '03..."How low do you go Shawty"?).  In any case...there is plenty to see down in the NC.  For one in the "Bull City" (Durham, NC) the crackheads hold relay races at 2 AM on Halloway...naw I'm playing.  For me to describe half the things would be entirely too difficult (Being under the influence doesn't help...or does it), you  just have to see it for yourself.  But one incident comes to mind...it's not about NC...but about southern VA (Close enough).  One late night/early morning on our way down to ATL, my boys and I stop at this gas station to fill up the tank (I hate Expeditions...the damn tank is the size of a swimming pool and it chugs that shit).  So we go into the store to pay for it...its approx. 3:00 AM...Why was there 9 year boy in the store buying a loaf of bread?  Why was there a crowd of people around 3 slot machines?  Why were the prizes in the slot machines calling cards?  Why wasn't I high or drunk so I could say I was seeing shit?  Oh I was driving.     Some stories come to mind involving tractors and shit, but I'll spare you those.  But in a way it feels real good to go down there. I remember when I used to spend entire summers down there, and not wanting to come back home.  Nice fresh clean air (expect by my Grandmother who lived near a Paper Mill...I'll probably start glowing in the dark or grow another ear or some shit in a year or two) to breathe in.  Nice red clay to phuck up a new pair of sneakers in...damn I miss it.  Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays...defining the term Niggaritis.  I can remember (and still) when visiting other family members and friends of family...you had to eat at every---single---house, or it was an insult.  I would come back home and still be chewing stuffing hidden on the side of my mouth with some cranberry sause. Can't forget the Iced Tea...if you're a diabetic...don't EVER get iced tea down in the Durty...you'll die...instantly.  If sugar was ever in short supply...you'll know why.  I think they dump the 5 pound bag of sugar in the phucker.  Stir it...and dump another 5 pound bag in the shit.  But that shit is good as hell if you dig sweet stuff (Note: That's how I like my women too).  But any way enough of me talking about this, cause I don't want to call into work and drive down tonight...cause I have done something on that level before.     My 26th Birthday (8/18)  Am I looking forward to it...I dunno yet.  Ask me when I turn 27.

      My intentions last night were not get drunk...but when you have 4 drinks back to back...without eating...it's bound to happen.  But then again I can handle the sauce...but damn this morning if the room wasn't spinning.   -Funny Ass People  I'm not talking about "funny" like "shady", but like "Ha, Ha, Ha you funny man" people.  Last night myself and a couple friends got together and went out to see a taping of "comedy Central Presents...".  If anyone has been to such a taping you will know that usually they don't tell you who is performing, because they don't want a big rush of people to catch a free show.  So as I'm waiting in line (waiting on someone in particular, who's idenity I'll protect because she was the last one to get there and you know that there is always one...ya know I'm playing wit ya) I saw Aries Spears from MadTV (Does funny ass impressions) walking down the street.  So I just assumed he was just checking out the show or something.  When the person who I was "waiting" on finally got there we went in.  Not really knowing what to expect from the show, cause I've seen the show before and no disrespect to any comedian but some of them just were not funny...the first comedian (Rocky LaRorte, I think that's how you spell his last name...had to grow on us) was pretty good.  Now thinking that the next comedian would be on the same level I figure it couldn't be any worse.  To my surprise Aries Spears was the closing comedian....When I say he was funny...I mean the damn boy was funny.  This was my first time seeing him do stand-up...he was definitely on his game.  He literally had the audience, including myself in tears.  What really put the crowd over the top had to be his impressions...if you closed your eyes you would thought the people he was impersonating were on stage.  He went from Tyson to Shaq to Bill Cosby to damn near everybody. (Someone elses favorite was Denzel Washington...or how she puts it "Dennnnnnnnnnzeeeeeel".  I got work on my Denzel impressions) This cat has true talent.  So if he is coming to your area...go see him...Support the brother.  As he said he's not a millionaire...he's a thousandaire...help him get his millions he deserves.  -Rick James' Passing  As I was typing this up I got word that Rick James passed away this morning in his home in Los Angeles.  Rick was definitely a pioneer in music, doing and saying things that the average person was scared to do.  Of course now what he was writing about is now the mainstream, he deserves the credit for opening some of the doors that other artists were able to walk through...man damn who else can write an ill ass song about smoking...

      I decided to write tonight through the advice of a friend, who has noticed I have been neglecting this like a bald headed step child.  Tonight's subject as you can see from the title is about how I must have a love of bullshit.  Not just any bullshit...the kind that makes the shit smell stay on ya for days.  Kinda like when you step in shit and you clean the shoes, only to have the shit smell come back (ie January 2004 Philadelphia Art Musuem...should of listened when she said watch your step).   -Work Bullshit  This morning around 5 am the stupid power went out.  Luckily my 6th sense woke me up just as it came back on or I would of been late to work (nothing new there).  I actually made to work on time...I should of known something evil was on the horizon....cause not only was I on time...get this...I was early (*Twlight Zone Theme playing*)...a whole 3 minutes early.  Something told me that I was in store for some shit today though...things were running all too damn smooth.  Then it happened...10 AM...I picked up my phone to make a call...and I didn't get off of the damn phone until 4:15.  Not because I was coaching a pregnant woman as she was giving birth...Because somebody may have (words chosen wisely) been trying to avoid doing their job.  Thus I was submerged in the 80ft. deep pool of pure bullshit.  Every which way they turn...it came squeezing out...the bullshit.  "I can't" they said..."It won't" they cried..."It's not working" they sighed.  So I could n't do anyhting else today but to get this stupid "thing" to work (No puns intended).  When I finally got it to work...this person came up with every excuse why they wouldn't use this thing now, after I spent 7 hours trying to get it work, when they "may" (words chosen wisely again) been sabatoging it the whole time...they didn't want to use the "thing".  BASTARD ass...(taking deep breath).  So I have made the decision to go back into work tomorrow, not looking for revenge...not to whine or bitch...cause I fucking have to...thus a I must be a glutton...well at least they pay me...or least they did last pay cycle.  -Personal Bullshit  I think the worse thing anyone can do to someone is to insult ones intellegence.  Now its one thing when the person is about about as smart as dog shit canned and labeled, but its another thing when the person posseses two of the world's tresures, memory and good old common sense.  Usually the two come in a tandem, and they spawn other tools like the ability to therorize and "putting two and two together".  Some people fail to regcognize such keep sakes as these when attempting to tell something that I like to call...a...damn lie...or better yet, a lame ass excuse.  Not to get into what brought this topic on...cause they're plenty of them (if you feel any guilt right now...then it's working...LOL) that can trigger something like this.  But please do the world a favor...drop the act...it ain't helping none.  OK...now that I've got that off my chest...let's talk about other things...well...when I come up up with something I'll write about it
