         Fill up, spread apart and open up wide  Time has come to join them side by side  Eyes of blank expression - emotional flatline  We own you now and everything is fine..  Exhale..

        Sometimes i stand back and watch you  With your fake smile and forced fashion  Sickening sometimes as you're all talk and no action  Trying way too hard at everything you do  Cant handle the fact your being is inadequate  You live to love and love to live in other's eyes  Not being cool makes you cry  Going as far as to take that social hit  No one can see the real story on the inside  Afraid if they do the charade will be over  Then maybe you'll grow up and feel older  Wishing only one would figure out whats in your mind  The latest single by a faceless band  Gotta have it gotta get it livin up to the status whore  Gettin tired and disgusted cant take it no more  Practiced at it so long you know it like the back of your hand

         You say its worth something  But its hard to define  Runnin around something simple  Slicing that line   Dissected till it fractures  Delicate system malfunction  Disgust is in the air waves  Choking on something   There was a time when  Answers 'n questions seemed the same  Absence of sense cut right up  Ignore the meaning and call it by name   For all the times i tried  You can take it with you when you leave  For all the times i lied  You can take it with you when you leave  For all the times the foundation died  You can take it with you when you leave  For all the ways it makes me blind  You can take it with you when you leave   Trendwhore accomplices  Mashing the barrier from real to fake  Narcotics till you're numb  Costs too much to eat your cake   Soldiers with no souls  Fighting the empty battles of the mind  Take the reigns and lead yourself to pain  You're in the spotlight and on you i must dine   Theres a space between  The things you know and the things you fear  Erased memories i can feel but cant touch  Holding back the martyr thoughts and tears   For all the times i tried  You can take it with you when you leave  For all the times i lied  You can take it with you when you leave  For all the times the foundation died  You can take it with you when you leave  For all the ways it makes me blind  You can take it with you when you leave

        Second chance to guess Everything looks like such a mess All i wanted was a little bit less Deeply inhale to murdah the Cess  Preparing for the final flight Strength is courage minus your might Bright sunshine and all i see is night Losing my vision and gaining my sight  Squinting my eyes 'cuz im so damn high Numbly watching the days go by Half smile whenever i hear you lie 1001 loyal Traitors and you're still at my side  How come the same old things seem so new Different people pass - only one real Krew Its the end of the world, brother.. what you gonna do Mass confusion in the concrete electro-zoo  Clock is spinnin, im running outta time Stepped right over and erased the line Phased and numb, feelin fine Doing the time but ive forgotten the crime
