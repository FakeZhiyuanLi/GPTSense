      right.. i was reading my p6 diary like last week coz i had nothing better to do.. yeap.. so this was what i found.. in k1 i had a very bad fall.. yeap.. anyway, i'll just type the granny story out ya? i was having tuition early in the morning. i felt very cold and grabbed my favourite pair of checket socks. after tuition i ate my lunch and kim, who was waiting for her sch bus to arrive. half way while eating, i asked kim if i could play with her mickey mouse key chain hanging on her bag and bring it to sch yada yada. so i ran down the steps to where she was sitting, and grabbed the key chain and ran back to the table.. but on my way there, i slipped and at where the stair case was.. as what i remember, kim ran to me and turned me over to find that my left eye was bleeding.. yeap.. she called my maid to come.. my maid ran to me and told kim to call my mum.. my maid then brought me to mum's shop and kim went to sch.. when i was at mum's shop.. i remembered all of mum's 'simtress' or whatever u spell it as gasped at the sight of my eye! i didnt know how it looked like.. i didnt get to stare at the mirror! i guess i'll prolly faint at the sight of it.. hmmm.. so anyway. dad came to the shop and drove my maid and i to mount elizabeth hospital where i waited in this room. and in the room, i found this boy and a mother.. the boy's bed was covered in plastic.. i mean i was so young that time.. i never really cared about the plastic covering the bed blah blah.. but anyway, that boy's mother gasped at the sight of my eye too! i mean.. is it that bad?! kim never told me how my eye looked like.. hmmmm.. ok.. after what seemed like hours, the doctor (or whatever u call it) came.. and asked me,'are you ready for your operation?' i mean i was only 6!! i didnt know what the heck an operation is.. so i just said,'what is an operation?!' blah blah.. being the dimwit that i am.. lalala.. ok anyway.. the nurse brought me to the operation room and i sat on that bed thing.. the nurse asked me.. 'which flavour do u like? strawberry, chocolate or just plain?' i dont like chocolate that much.. neither did i like 'plain' so i took strawberry... and soon, i fell asleep.. i woke up like dunno how many hours later.. blah blah.. and dad brought me home.. i remembered the first thing that my maternal grand mother said was,'gia si lang ah!' i think in hokkien it means,'horrible' or something. my hokkien is BAD. and i couldnt eat! the 3times i ate, i vomited! suck.. so anyway, i couldnt go to sch.. i only went to sch on the day of my kindergarden performance.. and when i went on stage to collect my certificate, the principal said i was very brave to be coming to sch with a plaster just beside my left eye..  kk then that's about it.. i dont remember the rest sadly.. hmmm.. tata!

      haiyo.. *sigh* you know what, i nearly cried again!! coz that indra.. so vicious.. last week, during tech studs, to some of u, you know it as DnT. mr tan told us that we are going to have a test, but most of us didnt here.. miss gwa (or whatever you spell it as) told us nevermind, since we didnt hear, then my as well postpone it.. but just like 3min before bell ring, mr tan came up to the&nbsp; class and told us that there is no excuse and we have to do the test.. miss gwa then closed the door and said we have to take the test.. indra rose up from his seat and carried his bag and walked to miss gwa and i think he was begging miss gwa to let him go.. i dunno why the hell did he do that.. but he did! then miss gwa didnt let him ago.. he walked to me and asked for the classroom key.. and i told him,'no.. sit down and take the test' he started threatening me..&nbsp;and i just breathed hard.. and i told myself to stay calm and not to say a word.. boys were trying to drag him away.. telling him to forget it.. sham was behind him&nbsp;telling me to give the key to him.. haider was telling me not to give it to him.. but i dont want any of my classmates to fail a test.. so i remained calm and told him to take the test then he can go.. but he just kept threatening me.. tears were filling my eyes.. i tried to remain calm.. i know miss gwa was watching.. my whole class was watching the whole class was quiet!! then he finally gave up and walked to the back of the class.. i breathed a sigh of relief and took my paper and started doing.. p.s he threatened to punch me.. that was why i was scared.. i'm glad that that is all over..

      *sigh* i had napfa test today, the five stations.. yeap.. i did quite ok.. but, being that i am class chairperson, i have to 'order' the class to do certain things like sit down and keep quiet.. but they were not cooperating and i was really REALLY frustrated.. and plus, my class was most of the time, before 'his' class.. my classmates were all telling me that 'he' is there.. i mean, i am NOT blind.. i KNOW!! *sigh* while waiting for the sit and reach.. even though, we gave mr hung the paper first.. he let 2A1 go first.. and guess what?! i got scolded by them.. i told them,'it is not totally my fault.. you people dont want to listen to instructions! what am i to do?!' then i kept asking them to move up to sit at this place coz i was told by mr hung to do so.. but, they didnt listen.. by that time, my endurance level was low.. then i kinda got scolded by indra.. then by that time, i REALLY couldnt endure.. and told jingpei to accompany me to the toilet coz i didnt want anyone to know that i was hurt.. and i needed to cry.. p.s i was crying coz well, you know.. 'him'..&nbsp; and when time&nbsp; came for our class to do sit and reach, i was still in the toilet crying and when jingpei told me that, i wiped my face and ran out.. put on my glasses.. i didnt really know if&nbsp;other class people&nbsp;knew i was crying.. all i knew was that, my classmates were all saying,'zenia! why you cry?! dont cry lah!' that sort of thing..  well, i am sorry, i couldnt hold my tears.. but if i could hold on to my tears and endure what i was suffering, i would.. p.s i am not the sort of person that speaks aloud and tell people how i feel.. i am a keep-to-myself person.. sis has to use the comp.. bye! *sigh*sobs*

      i dunno why i am once again being poured down into sadness.. it all started when i was in class after sch re-decorating the class notice board and the subject board.. i was thinking of where to put this and that.. with michelle, indra, jumali, rizwan, shufen and liyana..&nbsp;when all of a sudden.. i started thinnking of him.. his smile.. etc.. i just felt sad.. its like someone has sucked out all the oxygen inside of me.. i felt as though, i cannot breathe.. i then went out of the class pretending that i was just taking a stroll.. and when i went out of the class i held on to the black 'fencing' thing.. i forgot what it is called.. so that i wont drop to the ground.. why is it so easy to forgive but so hard to forget.. and when i want to try to forget, it hurts so badly.. i stupidly dont wish to let him know how i feel.. i find it would cause more trouble.. *plunged down into pure misery.- gd night. =(

      i dont understand!! i broke up with 'him'.. but i am in so much pain!! i didnt see 'him' in sch today.. i guess that he didnt come to sch.. i didnt expect myself to be actually sitting on my seat thinking about him... i didnt expect myself to be in so much sorrow.. i so badly wanted to run away from class and hide somewhere to cry!! i really dont understand why.. =( all i want to do is be all ALONE. i didnt want anyone pestering me for stuff.. i didnt feel like talking to anybody.. i just wanted to zip my mouth.. i dont understand why i'm typing all these out on to my blog when my personal diary is the one where i write all these down... perhaps.. i just want to flood my sorrows out even before i start writing my personal diary?! or what?! all i wish for now is to drift away with the clouds.

      i had an 'ok' time in sch today.. yeap.. i had computer test today and that was 1hr before sch dismisal yeap.. so i was sitting on my seat drawing all those weird shapes etc.. when it was time to do last few touches, i got so freaked out.. coz well, i dunno.. i just did!! haha.. after completing the written paper, it was 1.30pm.. then i remembered that i was to go back to class to sweep the floor for the sec4s to take their oral exam.. so i asked the teacher and passed up my paper.. and ran down to the classrm.. by myself.. coz i was one of the only few people that managed to finish early.. yeap.. then i met sze ern on my way back.. and i asked her to help me to sweep the floor and the arrange the tables etc.. after doing that, i left the sch, and went to big book shop to get pens.. afterwhich, i got dragged by sze ern to go kfc and eat.. which i did.. then i took 173 home.. but of course, i had to change bus to either 77 or 970.. yeap.. didnt want to take 156 today.. haha.. lazy to cross the road.. =p yeap.. then while i was walking back, i saw this huge white tent.. i was like,'whats going on?' then i realised that someone passed away.. i walked quickly.. and you know what? my neighbour.. she passed away.. even though, i have never been that close to my neighbours, i felt so sad.. i asked one of the maids of the house, who was the one that passed away.. she told me that i was the old lady.. the old lady which sits on a wheel chair.. and spends most of the time in the hospital i think.. coz, i hardly see her in the house.. i often see her getting out of the taxis only after several days.. when i look out of the window.. i actually felt a stab in my heart for that poor old lady.. i never spoke to her.. i have only smiled or waved at her.. i never knew her character.. i never knew anything about her.. now, i have to come to this.. 'rest in peace.. you will always remain in my memory.. even though, i never knew you all that well..'

      *sigh* i was on friendster last night, looking through my friendster list. when i found, 'his' classmate's friendster having 'his' whole class picture there.. and when i looked carefully, i saw 'him' right there.. somewhere in the middle.. my heart tightened up.. i felt as though i was suffering from a bad asthma attack.. then next, i didnt expect 'him' to come online, on msn almost immediately after i realised it was 'him' and 'his' classmates in the pic. and i was practically shivering! i really didnt know what to do.. i just sat on my orange chair facing the computer screen shivering.. until 'he' said 'hi' to me.. i breathed hard picked up all my courage and typed back 'hi'.. i dont want to go on anymore.. i'll just stop here and leave the rest of the story up to here.. all i can tell you is that, after that convo, i couldnt stop thinking of 'him'.. *sigh* my right hand is injured.. it is sooooooo stiff!! i can hardly move it.. how am i gonna finish all my hmk?!! *argh* byebye!
