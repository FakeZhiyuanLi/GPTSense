						   First day of school was interesting.  I am supposed to be at school at 7:45 this year, as opposed to 8:00 last year.  I had a hard time getting there at 8 much less 7:45! :(  I got up early, got ready; no problems.  Caitlyn, my 3 year old, says her tummy hurts when I get her up.  Ok, no big deal, no throw up, let's get dressed, let's go.  Sounds cold, I know, but I'm trying to start the year with an on time record. :)  We are ready.  We are at the garage door getting ready to walk out and, you guessed it, she throws up!  I clean her up, change her, throw a towell on the mess and bolt out the door.  I am now running late! argh!  I call my sitter during my conference period and she has already thrown up 2 more times!  Oh, Lord have mercy on me..... By the end of the day she had thrown up 4 times, had tummy aches in the middle of the night and, if that wasn't enough for the poor thing, she fell out of bed last night, which produced a huge "goose egg".  Today was much better, I must say.  She had a great day and so did mama, so everybody's happy!  I haven't walked yet!  Maybe I still can tonight.........

						   Well, here we are!  Another first day of school tomorrow.  I am excited in some ways (new start, new supplies, etc.)  However, I am sad to have to drop off my 3 year old at the sitter tomorrow.  I have the best sitter in the world but, well, if you are a parent you know.  We had so much fun this summer.  We made numerous library trips, a trip to the zoo, trips to the park and pool.  We had a blast.  I guess I should be thankful that I have such a "kid-friendly" profession.  I wouldn't want it any other way, really.  I get to do what I love all year long.  I am a little down tonight...not sure why.  Maybe it's all the changes in my schedule coming up, maybe it's money issues, maybe it's my weight.  Maybe it's ALL of those! :(  I have made a commitment to walk everyday either before or after school.  I have a great teacher friend who wants to walk so I will jump on that opportunity.  We had Open House for the 8th graders on Monday night.  It is always a dreaded day on my part b/c I go from 7:30 that morn. to 8:30 that night non-stop.  After open house, however, I was happy with how it went.  It's fun to see your new students and parents.  I'm sure that's the only time I will see 95% of those parents.  By the time they get into 8th grade, the parents kind of drop off of the parent/teacher scene.  All for now......

						   A friend  (Nixon Casablanca) directed me to his blog and I thought it pretty cool, so here I am with my own blog!  Just thought I would post a trial run here before I went any further.
