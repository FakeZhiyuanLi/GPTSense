      This is kind of a wierd thing, having the opportunity to write about nothing in particular with no intended audience.&nbsp; I'm not really sure if this is something I will do or not, but maybe I'll give it a whirl and see how it goes.&nbsp; Basically, here's my story: I'm from a small town in southwestern Minnesota.&nbsp; I grew up raising cattle and growing corn, wheat, and soybeans.&nbsp; I had and still have both my parents as well as a brother and two sisters.&nbsp; I was a smart kid in my high school and was always in the top of my class.&nbsp; I never partied or got in trouble and was generally a good kid.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Then I went to college. &nbsp; I went to NDSU in Fargo, ND in the fall of 1997.&nbsp; There I learned to appreciate the sweet necture of life that was and is beer.&nbsp; There I met some of my best friends and learned of the best mixes of all manners of alcohol.&nbsp; We partied hard for 2 wonderful years.&nbsp; Then, I got a letter from the dean.&nbsp; I was asked not to come back to NDSU in the fall.&nbsp; They figured that having 2 years to think about things, I'd be better off.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Well, what's a guy to do?&nbsp;  &nbsp; This guy decided he needed to get his head on straight.&nbsp; I went out to work as a camp cook at a bible camp I had went to as a kid.&nbsp; It was a rustic fort in the Black Hills of South Dakota with no electricity or running water.&nbsp; All I had to cook with was a fire and a hand pump.&nbsp; It was wonderful.&nbsp; We'd shower only once a week, hike miles a day, and have lots of time just to commune with nature.&nbsp;  &nbsp; While I was out at the camp I talked with a friend who was changing schools.&nbsp; The four-year schooling at a "typical" college was wearing on him and he needed something different.&nbsp; He was joining up with a buddy that went to a Tech School for Fluid Power Technology (hydraulics and pneumatics primarily).&nbsp; Well, I thought that sounded as good as any options I had so I signed up over the phone.&nbsp; Never set foot in the building til the first day of class.&nbsp; Turned out, that was one of the best decisions I ever made. &nbsp; But, that's probably enough for now.&nbsp; If anybody's even reading this, I'll fill some more in later. &nbsp; Cheers, Drewbie &nbsp;
