      This is the epic tale of ancient samurai getting a computer upgrade and transferring files to the new server in our office. Written in Haiku, the ancient Japanese poetry form, the syllables flow in a 5-7-5 rhythm.  Good fortune smiling; Computer upgrade is yours, but are you worthy?  Move all project files (and other important things) to the Server now.  Organize your files in subdirectories by the project number.  Personal files may be kept in subfolders in your “My Documents”.  If you pass this test, the Computer Færie will transfer your folders  to your new PC. Keep project files on the Server from now on.   Yeah, what a bunch of bullshit, but I'll bet there are not many IT haikus around.

      In between billable work, I am creating a list of things that would be difficult and/or dangerous to juggle, especially in various combinations. My list so far:  Running chainsaw Live grenade Bobcat or Possum Flaming torch Jellyfish Samurai sword Ming dynasty vase Rattlesnake Flask of cyanide (or any nasty chemical or biological agent) Ebola-infested livers  Do you have anything to add to this list? Feel free to contribute.

        What Country Are You?    (Thanks,  urlLink Jessica )           You're Colombia!       You do a lot of drugs, and these have kind of distorted your view of reality, to the point that everyone looks like an enemy. You keep trying to restore order over your schizophrenic world view, but you don't even know which goal is your own and which is someone else's. You're pretty sure someone needs to be punished for all this, but who that is changes all the time. Things would be a lot better for you if you switched to coffee, or even to decaf, but all this money would be hard to give up.

      There is a woman at my office whom I secretly call Mousey, or Abby (after my cat who behaves the same way).  She is very timid, refuses to take the right-of-way in the hallway or at the coffee pot, and is afraid of computers in general.  She is our bookeeper, and steadfastly chooses to keep hand-written ledgers to duplicate the work that the expensive accounting program does.  She doesn't trust the software, and keeps records to "check" the software.    She drives a small Honda Civic, ordinarily a nice little car, although it is funny for a 60+ yr old woman to have a "sporty" car.  Anyway, the car has stupid headrests.  I have become unnaturally obsessed with these stupid headrests.  They have posts on the side, rather than the center. I don't know how to describe them other than stupic.  They are aesthetically offensive.  They were probably designed by the ultra-conservative right-wing, or maybe the liberal media, or maybe the miltary-industrial complex, or maybe Osama.  They are just really STUPID headrests, and I wish I could rip them out of every Civic in the world and bring them to the Japanese designer's desk and stomp on it in front of him, shouting "DON'T YOU SEE HOW STUPID THESE ARE?????"  I am amazed at how much time I have devoted to denigrating the headrests on a car.  Konichiwa.

      There is a young woman (I think she is 19) in our office who could be a model.  She is not too skinny or pouty or stuck-up, she looks great, and she smells captivating.  Whatever she wears for perfume, it is definitely worth whatever it costs.    BTW, speaking of attractive, Alanis Morissette's new look is very beguiling.

      Greatest Hits - 01.16.2004  So I finally decided to say the D-word: depression.  I went to the doctor for migraine medicine after two real scary-excruciating headaches.  While there, I mentioned that I was trying to isolate causes, and had settled on stress, tension, possibly depression, and maybe mold in the office.  Doc's ears perked up when I mentioned depression, so I had another appt., talked about it more, and I will start seeing a "shrink" very soon.  I did not realize how difficult it would be for me to actually discuss w/ the doctor.  I felt so defeated and powerless, like I can't help myself, I may as well join the dopes on Jerry Springer.  I know logically that I should not feel that way, but I did.  Sue me.  I have started thinking about what to say or discuss, and of course I think first about what is wrong with me, and bad memories, and start into a downward spiral.  I see help coming though, so I will withstand the urge to self-pity.  I can see that this will be a VERY difficult process for me.  I hate when I can't figure things out, and I hate worse admitting that fact.  There are a ton of memories that have receded far back in the past that I would like to keep in that dark little corner of my brain, but I have a feeling it is in my best interest to clean out that corner.  What does it mean to "deal with" things in the past that are so bothersome?  I have a mental image of cleaning out a dark, musty, pile of creepy, alien objects that belong in another dimension... taking each object, cleaning away the gunk that obscures the details, and examine it with a magnifying glass under bright lights... understanding every detail, making sense of it, accepting it without the filters of time and memory and values.  Finish with one object, go on to the next, making notes on each, assembling a pattern of clues that will reveal some wisdom about how these things were created ...why I think the way I do, why my experiences and beliefs have affected the way I relate to people, why I like being bummed all the time, and why I have such a hard time accepting the way things really are.

      I will admit that if I posted something today, I didn't necessarily write it today.  I have written several things in the past for myself or in letters to people that, upon reflection, I thought came out really well.  A personal "greatest hits", if you will.  Since I am new to blogging, I wanted to put out a bunch of stuff quickly that shows different things about myself.  I will not overload on this, I have to keep you guessing for a while, right??  Thanks for reading, I'll be here all week.  BTW, I have 15 minutes on France and Ice that killed at a dinner party last week.

      Greatest hits - 9.17.03  Sometimes Nikki says something where you think she is a tiny bit psychic, although you never know for sure.  I think most kids are a tiny bit psychic, but when you grow up you talk yourself out of believing in that "little voice" from the subconscious.  But you hear all the time about stories where someone didn't get on a plane, or knew to call someone at the right time, etc.  I take that back, I think maybe boys lose that ability at age 6 and never regain it, while girls are just a little psychic for a while longer.  My son specifically, and boys generally have a problem with this; hindsight is more like 20-200, not 20-20, and foresight is beyond the realm of belief.  Things like Nintendo and Captain Underpants and Spongebob Squarepants get in the way of logic, planning, reponsibility, etc.  Boys also have a general interest in anything involving the crotch area or flatulence; this finally wanes at about age 30 and returns at age 40 until death.

      I have so much to say sometimes, I wonder how I can contain it.  I wish I could sit and write for 2 or 3 days straight, and just get it all out in writing so I can see the beast and kill it.  I have so much pent-up frustration and dissapointment and anger with myself and almost everyone around me.  Sometimes I get a panic attack and I have to go to the beach and start yelling.  I am so fucked up.  The therapist tells me I am still an abused child, that I continue to abuse myself every day.  Bite me, maybe I like it that way.

      The old saying is that opposites attract.  Anne and I are not opposites, we come from similar economic setting, both quite introverted, a little nervous of social situations, etc.  I wonder if maybe we are too similar.  She has a very hard time communicating with me about her thoughts or feelings, unless it is about her job (she can talk all day about that).  We talk about the boring mundane stuff frequently, but it's like we are both scared to scratch any deeper.    The problem for me is that sometimes I get on a tangent and need to bounce really deep ideas or fears or concerns off someone who can give me feedback, constructive criticism, good advice, or even just pretend like they care.  Usually all I get is "uh-huh" or less, just a look that could mean "I understand and I love you and I will support you no matter what", or maybe "I don't talk about my problems, so why must you", or maybe "Oprah is coming on, I need to end this conversation", or maybe "that burrito was a mistake."  I can never tell what she is thinking, and she won't tell me, even when I literally beg.  I have not been a perfect partner, but I think I have gone way more than halfway in trying to communicate and trying to keep the interest alive in our marriage.  She just will not communicate with me unless it becomes a big deal, with tears and heavy emotions and pent-up stuff coming out in a pyroclastic blast.  I fear that so much that I start not communicating myself, on the premise that I have two choices.  I can say what is on my mind, and cause an emotional crisis, or I can just keep my mouth shut, and put off the crisis another day.  I just feel like she is not interested in sharing things or discussing things with me that are REAL important - feelings, fears, problems.  Sometimes I think she loves me but doesn't really like me.  Maybe it goes both ways...

      I generally have a poor view of people in general, but sometimes I am stunned by my reaction to people.  It may be nothing they do or say, it is just a feeling that pops up when least expected.  I went through the drive-thru at Arctic Circle.  (a low-class fast food joint with ice cream, I wish there was a Dairy Queen in town)  There is one guy at the drive through who has always creeped me out, and he is always there waiting for me, telling me in his smarmy, lewd, perverted voice, "here's your chicken salad, out of a big TEN dollars, your change is 3.53!".  But today as we exchanged food and money, our hands briefly touched in that strangely uncomfortable way, and a subconscious drive-thru speaker sounded in my head, screaming "HE MASTURBATES WITH THAT HAND", then "CHILD MOLESTER".  I was so stunned almost drove off without my food, thankful when the other worker handded it to me.  I cannot describe the disgust and revulsion that came over me in that moment.  He did nothing out of the ordinary, and is probably guilty of nothing other than nerdiness, but I will never get that out of my brain. The salad tasted poisoned, as I thought about it all of lunch.  Did you ever read Stephen King's Dead Zone, where the character gets a psychic flash of people when they touch?  Very creepy.  The other thing that creeps me out is the thought of the skanky ho's that apparently find desparate customers down on 2nd street.    More about this later.

      Yesterday was an example of how much I am changing, how fast Nikki is growing up, and how much I love her right now.  When she was born, somehow I just knew that her place in my life would be to introduce chaos and keep my life interesting.  I am always set in my ways and try to be very logical about making decisions or taking action, not making waves, stay within the lines.  Nikki is spontaneous and random, unwilling to blindly accept the authority of time, custom, or parental mandate (especially me).    Last night she decides that she wants me to take her to the beach while Anne and Daniel go to swimming class.  I immediately can think of several reasons why this is not a good idea - homework, school night, she will need a bath, cold, windy, I don't feel like it, what about dinner, and more.  When I thought about it for a few minutes, though, I guess it might be possibly OK to maybe see if there is some way it could be possible... (very decisive here, huh?) ... and I allowed myself to think WHY NOT instead of NO WAY.  Why not go to the beach?  There is nothing wrong with having fun during the week, we can spend time together without the two kids competing, as long as we don't stay too late, etc.  So we went, and it was fine, not tremendously fun but not bad in any way, it simply was being there.  Of course she was bossing me around much of the time, but we built a hole in the sand with stairs leading up, and we found a beach flea (a small crustacean).    Kids seem to understand how to do things without any sort of expectation about how it should be, or if everyone is satisfied at the end, or without worrying about what other people might think.  I can learn a lot from her.   I hope she will remain this way, despite anything I might say or do, because it will make us both better people.  Everyone like me needs someone in their life that is like her.  In high school, I became best friends with a girl who always kept me off-balance, who wasn't afraid to do something offbeat just for fun, and who was willing to take my hand and force me to learn something new.  Now, the role belongs to my daughter, and I'm grateful for it.

      Wherever you are, welcome to my blog.  I have felt a need lately to write some thoughts down, but they always end up as long boring letters to by best friend.  Instead of wearing her out with my endless blathering, I will subject you to my random thoughts instead.  Fern Canyon is an actual place here in Humboldt County, CA, maybe you've seen it in the movies.  My Fern Canyon is in the recesses of my brain, a dark, damp, intensely green and fertile place where I am not afraid to share my thoughts and not constrained by what everyone else needs me to be.  Sometimes I am funny, often depressed, sometimes exasperated, seldom truly happy, usually cynical, frequently amazed, but always willing to be honest and shine the light on the dark corners of my brain to examine the skeletons therein.  If you are still here, thanks for paying attention.  Isn't that what we all want, someone to notice us?  Please drop me a comment or a personal e-mail if you like.  I'm interested in what others think about my rantings.

      At the Crabs game the other night, there was a loud, obnoxious girl, 20-something, blabbing her mouth the whole damn time.  She was with a group of people, some paying attention to the game, others just blabbing and drinking.  I cannot fucking stand people like her who just blah, blah, blah simply for the sake of hearing her own idiotic voice.  The more she drank, the louder she got, flopping on me a few times, almost spilling her beer on me and my kids, yelling at people walking by (hey, I looove you, call me), and oh yeah, once in a while said Go Crabs.  The dumb bitch probably does not know a fucking thing about baseball, she was just there to drink cheap beer.  The only thing worse than "cool" people are "cool" people who interfere with my enjoyment of a ball game.

      Whatta crappy day.  I am sick as a dog.  Fever, chills, sore throat, etc.  For those of you not from this area, the name for this variant of the cold/flu is the Humboldt Crud.  I don't know why, but when you get sick, you feel it a little worse here than other places.  When I first moved here, I didn't believe it either.  Then I got my first taste of the Crud, and I am a believer.  I stayed home sick yesterday, and did absolutely nothing but sleep all damn day.  I got up about 5pm to visit with the family downstairs, watched the Giants game, then went back to bed.  I came into work today, but I will leave again in a few minutes.  We went to see the  urlLink Humboldt Crabs  game Monday night.  Crabs won, pretty good game.  The kids survived just fine.  I love baseball.  Bye for now, hack, cough, moan, gimme Nyquil or give me death.

      At lunch today, I was continuing in the book "When Anger Hurts".  One chapter, Anger and Children, may have been the most important thing I have ever read in my life.  I totally see everthing that they are talking about in my problems with the kids, especially Nikki.  My past mistakes are the major source of her anger, and in part why she acts the way she does toward me and others sometimes.  She has learned how to be angry from me.  I feel horrible for this, but I will not beat myself up about it.  I am not the same person I was six months ago.    What I will do is take action, starting TONIGHT, by explaining as best as she can understand what this means and how I will work to make sure I do not do any more damage.  She is only 7, but a very smart 7, and she has very little problem putting her feelings into words, even when she knows they are hurtful to herself or others.  Instead of trying to control her, I need to convince her to be a partner with me, to help establish reasonable limits, and to make sure she doesn't blame herself for my problems and actions.  Finally, I just need to shower her with love instead of anger.  I love my little girl so much it hurts.  She has such potential and freedom and creativity inside, and if I can learn how not to stifle her growth, she will be a spectacular person.  (Not to overlook my son, I love him just as much, but in a different way.)  I have been given so much, it's time for me to appreciate it and make sure I don't miss out on feeling happy for and proud of my kids.

      I have been reading several blogs lately, and I am drawn to people who have thoughts and fears and problems similar to myself.  Pretty typical, I suppose.  I think the thing that strikes me most is how many common feelings are shared by many people, in different ways and different language, but still similar: joylessness, anger, boredom, being unfulfilled, compromise, confusion, worthlessness.  I think most people do not feel a need to constantly question and doubt themselves and everything they do and everyone else around them.  I think it is more that people like myself end up finding common ground with each other, if we can get past our fears and inhibitions enough to actually talk about things like this.  I also think these are the people who end up blogging or finding some other outlet (like group therapy).  Take myself, for example.  I am basically terrified of talking to people from fear of not being accepted, a lack of self-confidence, and difficulty setting appropriate boundaries for relationships.  I can be utterly alone in a room full of people I know just because I am afraid that they don’t care about anything I have to say.  In a group of strangers I may engage in some small talk, but it is still uncomfortable for me.  If I was in a room for 2 hours with 10 people having the exact same thoughts and problems as me, what is the chance any of us would ever talk about it?  Pretty slim.  It's not "safe" in normal society to just blurt out your fears and concerns to total strangers.  But in the blogging world, everyone essentially shares a little (or a lot) about themselves, and it is a lot easier to “get to know” someone by reading their thoughts like you never can in the real world.  There is a safety in being somewhat anonymous, but you can still interact with others whose blogs get your attention.  I have e-mailed a few people about things in their blogs that struck me, and have traded a few messages now.  I think it would be cool to sit down with these people and have a cup of coffee and talk about whatever, heavy things, funny stuff, what makes them tick, etc.  This has opened me up to the possibility of caring about other people’s feelings and desires, and the feeling that I can share things to other (anonymous) people without being too close or getting hurt or damaged somehow.  I think this is helping me grow as an individual.  I suppose my outlook on blogging would totally change if I was blogging to keep in touch with friends, share funny stories about the gang giving away watermelon, discuss Sarah's crush on Joseph, or whatever else people with friends do.  I see some blogs as a group journal where a group of freinds shares stuff that is mildly funny or frivolous or interesting, but not very deep or intense or angst-ridden.  (That's not a put-down at all, just an observation.)  Obviously mine is not that kind of blog, as I am doing this for soul-searching, for figuring stuff out, for survival.  Finally: I think there is a tacit understanding among everyone here in Blogworld that we are all a little vulnerable, and we need to be careful with each other’s feelings.  I know some people do not have that same level of care and respect, but so far I get the feeling that there is generally support and concern for a person’s feelings, and people without nice things to say don’t say anything at all.

      We had Nikki’s birthday party and sleepover this weekend.  We had seven 7-9 year old girls in the house overnight.  Girls are different than boys, I’m pretty sure.  The group of girls had three arguments and make-ups, interspersed with screaming, playing in the wading pool, talking about horses, snacks, movies about horses, screaming, playing with toy horses, chasing Dan, screaming, and pretending to be horses.  They were loud until about 1:30 am, then finally went to sleep.  I was out at 12am, but Anne stayed up until about 1 am.  We got up about 7 am and cooked bacon and pancakes for all the kids.  Nikki slept latest, waking up at about 9:30, after one girl had already gone home.  So after everyone went home, I am exhausted, another migraine setting in, just thinking about relaxing for the day, maybe take care of some small tasks at home.  Anne and the kids suddenly decided to go to the fair, but I didn’t want to go, so they went without me at about noon.  Since then, I have been on the laptop writing blog stuff, e-mail, my therapy journal, while keeping track of the Arena Bowl (San Jose wins, 69-62, who really cares?) and eating.  I have had a big bowl of “grasshopper” ice cream (that’s chocolate chip mint, for those who don’t know) and bacon so far.  Boy, do I love bacon!  Maybe I’ll write a poem.

      I am in the process of writing a long summary of what happened when I was a kid, the warped reality that resulted, and what I've done with that reality since.  I am also developing the list of characters that are in my head, to try to nail down the negative self-talk problems.  I will post it, even though it will be quite long.  I was real down last night, although I can't put my finger on why specifically.  I think sometimes I just get emotionally tired, not necessarily sad or angry or depressed.  I know it's just a symptom, but sometimes I have no energy or desire to do anything.  I wanted to leave the house for a while last night and just be by myself, but Anne was going to her quilt class.  She offered to take Nikki with her, so Dan and I were at home.  He left me alone for part of the time, but wanted to play later, so I did.  I forced myself to play a game with him (I like to play with him) but I really didn't want to .  I went to bed as soon as Anne got home, while she stayed up late (as usual).  I am feeling sick.  My migraine is back, the stuffy nose and allegies have been after me for a month now, and I just feel worn out.  Sleep helps, but not much.  My stomach is upset, and I think I will go home.  Great timing:  Nikki's birthday party and sleepover is this weekend.  It will be interesting - 5 or 6 little girls running around and screaming all weekend.  I don't mind, as long as she enjoys herself.  Bye Bye, bloggers, see ya Monday.

      I'm quite happy with myself.  I repaired an older laptop for the office, replacing hard drive and cleaning dust out.  Those are relatively simple tasks, but the real challenge is in the disassembly and reassembly.  All the parts fit back together, eventually; I only had to use super glue twice; the keyboard still works; and I only have 3 screws left over.  I think the pointy-mouse-q-tip stick was broken before, and they are unusable anyway, so that is no big loss.  Anyway, it ran successfully, and that's all that counts.  BTW, Damn I'm good at working on computers.  No programming or design, just taking the tools and leaning to use (and repair) tham, and teach others how to do the same.  Maybe I should see what it takes to teach at CR, the local junior college.  Music:  Led Zeppelin IV, my favorite LZ album. Books:  Anything by David Baldacci.  He is a good suspense storyteller.  No therapy yesterday, C. was sick, so they said wait until next week.  I didn't have much to say anyway, I've pretty much said everything here lately.  Maybe I can just print the blog and leave early for my next appointment.

      For Father's Day I took the fam to visit the  real  Fern Canyon, in  urlLink  Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park .  The kids didn't want to go at first, and I would not have complained, but Anne convinced tham that it would be fun, and I wanted to do it, and the kids agreed.  Fern Canyon is adjacent to one of the least crowded but accessible beach areas remaining in California.  You have to drive about 7 miles in and out on a little dirt road - pretty typical for this area.  The land is an uplifted terrace, with layers of compacted soil and depositied gravels compressed together over time at the bottom of the sea.  When uplift occurred, this section of the coast was not deformed in the same way as most areas locally.  Streams began cutting into these tightly compacted gravels, but created vertical-sided gorges rather than the typical V-shaped canyon with unstable slopes.  The resulting landform gives you up to 75-foot high near-vertical walls covered with many species of ferns, with a year-round stream flowing at the 20-30' wide bottom.  There is wildlife in the area as well.  There are several herds of Elk roaming the area, and you must be careful to not get too close accidentally.  There were coho salmon fry (endangered here) swimming in the stream, waiting untill fall rains to migrate the short distance downstream to the ocean.  Frogs were abundant, but we did not see any salamanders.  After walking the canyon, we went to the beach and watched seals, pelicans, cormorants, crustaceans, and waves.  On the drive out, we stopped about 15 feet from a medium size bull elk, munching on a willow tree, wary but not concerned with our van's presence, velvet still decorating his large antlers.  It was pretty cool seeing one that close in its environment, but I'm glad we were in the van and not on foot.

      After high school, I attended a semester at Univ of Nevada, Reno.  Why only 1 semester, that's a story for a different day.  I have many good stories from that first semester away from home to write down.  Anyway, I ate regularly at the UNR Dining Commons (aka Dysentery Commons) because it was included with the dorm.  Two bad experiences:  There was one lady working there who apparently had plucked her eyebrows off, or else they were burned off in a kitchen accident.  (Why women pluck, I will never know.)  Then as part of her makeup ritual, she painted on new eyebrows with what appeared to be 90W gear oil.  She always seemed to be working around the steamed vegetables, steamed corn, green beans, or peas, where the steamer pan is set into the steel countertop which contains hot, steaming water.  The steamer was in a small side room, and all that steam and humidity made it very warm, and people, including the eyebrow lady, would sweat.  When she started sweating, and the steam hit her face, the painted-on eyebrows started running down her face, looking like stained tears from alien eyes.  The eyebrows ran into her eye and down her cheek.  I don't know if any of the eyebrows made it into the steamed vegetables or not, but I know I skipped steamed vegetables after seeing her working.  Another time, after eating lunch at the DC, I didn't feel so good.  I went back to my room and went to sleep.  I woke up two and a half days later, undressed, with a few concerned friends sitting around.  They told me I was delirious and had a high fever the whole time.  My friends Becky and Tracy had taken off my clothes to help me stay cool from the fever, but I never knew it.  (They never told me if they did anything to me while I was asleep and undressed, but they seemed to enjoy whatever happened.)  They said that they were ready to call for medical help if I had not woke up when I did.  Apparently I had got bad mayonnaise or mold or maybe salmonella from something.  The funny thing is, I don't remember getting up to use the bathroom (outside the room, down the hall) the whole time.  Anyway, be careful of food!

      Therapy day today, so I take off work early.  I came in 1 hour early to make up for the lost time, and spent it writing and catching up on the Giants.  Oh well, the best of intentions.  I don't know what I am going to discuss with the therapist; I rarely know ahead of time where I want the conversation to go.  I have come in with a specific issue a few times, but usually I just let it happen (very difficult for me).  I am SO tired.  I can hardly keep my eyes open, sitting at my desk and yawning like a fool.    I don't want to be here, I don't care about the tribe's casino design, I dont care about the other tribe's road decommissioning, I don't care about the third tribe's road building project.  Lately we have been doing a lot of engineering and environmental work for the three major Indian tribes in the area.  This area in particular has a rich native culture that is appreciated and supported by the non-Indians as well.  I would love to study their cultures rather than doing engineering for them.  OK, hi ho, off to work.  Bye for now.

      I e-mailed a couple of people from high school on Classmates.com last Friday.  The paranoid critic says "They won't respond because you were a geek and they never liked you."  In reality, they probably check the Classmates site about as often as I do, meaning it may be weeks before they get the message.  Fine, it's been 15 years, what's another week or 2?  My world will not end one way or another.  However, I would like to hear from Angie's sister, if that was really her. (see earlier post.)

      Another billable day.  Ho-hum, whatever.  I have vacation in about 3 weeks, so that is something to anticipate.  I guess I am in a blah mood today, but not really the wet gray blanket I have felt so much lately.  Not every day can be happy and bright.  Just slightly above blah is OK for me right now, I can't handle too much contentment at once.  I think that I am starting to believe that I can change my thought processes just a little bit, enough to be more in a healthy controlled state rather than the violent mood swings or hopeless, panicky depression.  It turns out that the medication maybe does 20% of the work, but I have to do the rest.  I think that I need to mourn for a lost childhood, lost opportunities, and a lost father.  I need to direct my anger at its cause (the Old Bitch).  This will allow me to not be angry at the people around me or myself.  I need to remind myself constantly that I don't need to be paranoid about people and that I don't have to trust them with everything to be friendly with them.  I can't control others' actions, I can only control my reactions.  I am not defined by my job or my appearance or my history.  I will be defined by my actions and my thoughts today and every day in the future.  OK, one day at a time.  Small steps, small goals, enjoy small successes.  (This sounds really dopey, but it makes sense to me, really, I swear.)

      Since starting therapy, I have been reading many books on depression, anger, cognitive therapy, neuroses, psychotherapy, etc.  I don't understand a lot about this process, so I did what comes natural to me - I started reading to learn.  Along the way, I have read good texts and dopey self-help platitudes, but I have a pretty good ability to filter our the crap and get what I need or what I feel is important to me.  My new favorite book is "The Inner Enemy".  Anyway, I am currently reading "When Anger Hurts".  I have got a lot of help from this so far.  I thought it would be more about physically abusive anger, but I am finding that there are many forms.  Perhaps mine is the most destructive, where I just keep it inside for a while and let things stew until I "blow up" at the least appropriate time, at people who have very little to do with the actual source of tension.  I think that I am understanding more the reasons why I have behaving the way I do.  I am not trapped into continuing negative behaviors, and I can change how I react to certain triggers that get me upset or angry.  First I will work on the outside anger; then on the inward anger, by controlling my responses to outside actions or situations.  I cannot control others, but I can learn to control myself better.

      Dan ran in a kids triathalon on Saturday.  The race was the day before his birthday, so he was registered in the Junior division.  However, the officials did not account for leap year when they made their spreadsheets with Excel (good 'ol Bill Gates!).  So on race day, Dan got lumped in with the Senior division (11-14 years old).  We did not find this out until after the race had begun, and he was basically stuck.  He had to swim 200m, bike 6 miles, and run 1+ miles, rather than half that effort as he thought he would be doing.  So at the beginning of the race, you are prepared for your race, your distances, etc., then you start and realize you have to do twice the work - how many people (not just 11-yr-olds, but adults also) would quit, give up, mot make it, or make excuses?  Dan did not quit, he ran the race and knew the error the whole time, but he just did it anyway!  Afterward I know he was proud, although he was trying to downplay the whole thing.  The officials even gave him an inspiration award for not quitting after their mistake.  His time? 51:20 (approximately).  He (and all the other 11-14 kids) had to work for almost an hour.  I know I couldn't do it in that time!  I am very proud of my son for working so hard.

      I was adopted when I was three days old.  Due to the draconian laws of the Soviet Republik of Kalifornia, I cannot get my  original  birth certificate, only my revised b.cert. with my adopted name.  My mother was 17, I think, when I was born.  She was the daughter of an Air Force family, I think, so it's possible she moved somewhat frequently.  I have a picture from the high school yearbook in 1969, and yes, there is a strong resemblance.  I even mailed everyone in the country I could find with the same last name (only 400 or so, not that common).  But it seems like I can't find her.    I have decided to make a stronger effort to find my mother and see what happens.  Believe me, I have been over the pros and cons many times mentally and with family.  I realize it may turn out badly for one or both of us, and she may not want to meet me.  I have gone through the possibilities, and I am prepared to deal with whatever happens.  Whether or not we develop a relationship, there are a few things I want this person to know.  I want to thank her for giving me a chance at life.  I had the opportunity to live and experience everything, good and bad, because she made a conscious decision to give me a chance.  No matter how messed up I am, not matter what happened to me between 3 days old and today, none of it is her fault.  I have no anger or ill will whatsoever toward her, just gratitude.  I hope she does not feel guilty, and I hope she has not been sad about me, although I know it is likely she has.  I cannot imagine how painful it must be to give up your own child to someone else.  I want her to know that after all this time, I can tell her she made a good choice with the cards she was dealt, and it worked out just fine.  BTW, in no way is this a political stance one way or another on abortion vs adoption.  Neither should be a political issue, and I think everyone should shut the hell up about it.  Men should have learned by now that it doesn't work to try to tell women what they can or cannot do, because women run the whole show.

      Quote from me, last April:   Daniel is a great kid.  I wish I could care about people as much as he does.  He is almost always considerate of other peoples' feelings and truly cares about his friends, even when they aren't nice to him.  Give him another year, and he will find out how insincere and superficial other people really are, and turn bitter and hateful like me.  For now, he is wonderfully naive.   It turns out I was wrong on several counts.  A year later, he has not turned spiteful and bitter like me yet, and I hope he never feels he has to.  He has learned to protect himself a little while still feeling free to express himself at home, usually in an appropriate manner.  More importantly, I am learning from him (and from therapy) that it is not normal or healthy to turn spiteful and bitter and hateful and angry.  If I can re-learn how to protect my inner self in an appropriate way, I can learn to interact with people without being scared and mistrustful of them.

      Maybe all is not hopeless.  Yesterday at therapy C. helped me make several realizations:     I am angry all the time, but it is really just a proxy for feelings of hurt, sadness, mistrust, and loss.   I suffered many losses as a child -    by death, starting with my Grandpa, then several old people I liked, then finally Mom dying when I was 21;  the "loss" of my birth mom, whom I never knew but I wanted (and still want to this day) some sort of connection;  the "loss" of a father, any one, adopted or natural, to be there for me; and most significant,  the loss of childhood, where I never felt it was safe or allowable to just be 8, or 10, or 14, or 18, or 21, always feeling like I needed to be older than my years.   The injustice and sadness connected with all these losses is that the one person who should have died, who I wanted to die, never did.  The Old Bitch just kept on living, feeding off the anger and bitterness and meanness and hate inside her like a cold, unholy fire. Like an evil spirit, she came to haunt me even at Mom's funeral.  She never had to pay for making Mom and I so fucking miserable and scarred and messed up for the remainder of our lives.  I loved my (adopted) Mom very much, and I felt like I could protect her from the Old Bitch by directing the abuse toward me.  I don't think it worked, and it just made things worse.  From the time I was 8 or 9, I never felt it was OK to bother Mom with my problems because she had enough pain dealing with the abuse she received.  I learned very early that a child can put a vast amount of pain and hurt into the vault, but eventually it fills up.  I learned not to trust my emotions with anyone but myself.  When I wanted to make friends with people, I started oscillating wildly between (1) needing a friend, opening up too much too quickly, getting criticised or teased, leading to mistrust; or (2) self-isolation based on mistrust, causing a loneliness and a need for emotional relationships, then back to (1).  This resulted in many awkward and painful times trying to socially interact with others, which continues to this day.  The abuse given to me has poisoned every relationship I have, causing me to act in anti-social ways in an attempt to protect myself and keep true emotions outside the defenses.  I still have the capacity to be a loving, understanding, caring person.  I need to choose to behave in that way rather than behaving as the inner Old Bitch would have me behave.  I want to find my birth mother before it is too late.  Lost opportunities suck, and none of us are getting any younger.  If I do not try to contact her and then she dies before I meet her, that loss will be very painful.   I might be able to have a sliver of hope that I can change things, that I can let MY self come through instead of being ruled by the Old Bitch.

      Why ia admitting depression or taking anti-depressants such a big deal still?  It's not like saying you're gay.  People take pills for headache, diabetes, heart problems, why not brain problems?  But there is still a stigma (doctor's word) that still lingers about psychotherapy.  I admit that I feel somewhat embarassed or awkward about it, when logically I know that is silly.  A common phrase is "chemical imbalance".  that word 'imbalance' in particular has connotations that go back hundreds of years in the English language, as well as unstable, unbalanced, manic (like maniac). (just an observation.)  I wish it were as easy as the commercial with the sad egg under the rain cloud, then after taking pills the cloud goes away and the egg happily rejoins the other eggs for some eggciting activity.  When I see that, I'm thinking omlettes.

      At the office, occasionally wiring gets "improvised", like instead of running cables trough a ceiling, a hold gets drilled in the wall between 2 adjoining rooms.  Well, that was done between the accounting office and the tank fund reimbursement office here.  After moving computers around and installing new wiring, a big file cabinet prevented removal of an unused network cable.  Eventually, someone asked my why they could not access the server.  Always check the dummy stuff first - all cables have 2 ends!  Sure enough, she was "networked" to a 1960's-era metal file cabinet.

      OK.  To reset, about 10 days ago, Anne and I were in bed snuggling and being lovable, when she says in a particular tone of voice that she needs to ask me something.  This is usually a warning that I will be asked to do or say something from which there is no graceful escape.  She then says that she thinks she knows what my answer will be, but she wants to ask anyway.  Now I really am nervous, because it must be something I've already expressed apprehension about but she wants me to do what she wants regardless.  Finally, she gets to the point: she wants another child.  I suspect she actually wants a specific child, a 1-yr old in foster care with her mom.  This was not entirely a surprise, because she mentioned it about a year ago, and similar discussion occurred then as now:    We already talked about this a few years ago, that was why I got spaid or neutered 4 years ago.  We didn't want any more kids then, what has changed?  Kids are inconvenient, messy, and for a period of several years their sole purpose is to turn your life to shit.  (Going to dinner last night, for example.) They take what would ordinarily be an easy relaxing task, chew it up, and to replace it they hand you a load of shit, which may include whining, screaming, tantrums, trips to Disneyland, puberty, and multiplying credit card bills.   I love my kids dearly because they are mostly done with the stage where you have to do everything for them, and they can perform many tasks with minimal supervision.  There is no way in hell I want to ever change another diaper or get shit on or peed on or puked on ever again.  Two is enough, I can't possibly stand any more.  I especially don't want to go through the process again for someone else's child.  I am so emotionally fucked up right now that I don't need any more stress at all.  I have a hard time dealing with life right now.  If another child was added, I would snap.    I told her that I felt like I was in a no-win situation because if I say what I said, she would be angry and resentful toward me.  If I let her do what she wants, I would be resentful towards her and the child, and our kids would probably have some negativity as well (Nikki in particular - she would be unmanageably angry and hurt).  I said that we make comments about people who decide to bring a new child into a less-than-stable home situation, and I think my emotional state would qualify as unstable right now.  So am I a selfish bastard?  Am I heartless and uncaring about the plight of foster children and my wife's desires?  Or am I making a reasoned, logical, wise decision?  I am second-guessing myself, but I think I did the right thing.  Please insult me if I am wrong; be specific and verbose.

      I had a real weird dream the other night.  I'm not sure why, but in the dream it was a meeting in a house, and this small paper lunch sack represented a solution to the problem at hand.  Everyone there was very condescending, like I was powerless or not relevant to the action, and I had no skills or ability to give.  I was concentrating on the bag, like an irrational thought that if I could move the bag it would show everyone that I was powerful, that I could solve this problem.  I glared at the hateful bag and (in the dream still) sent a mental 'shove' to escape the inertia of normal physical laws of physics - AND THE BAG LIFTED!  Just for a second, and everyone saw it.  But at the same time, (in the dream) I dropped into semi-conscious trance, a seizure almost, but consciously aware (between sleep and awake) that I am shaking my way back to the bedroom, (struggling to escape the seizure) in my bed finally but still stuck in place, almost like my soul being pulled out of my body against my will.  The dream/seizure finally ends, I am fully awake, heart pounding, mentally checking myself to see what is normal and what's not.  Maybe only 5-10 seconds in awake-time, but it seemed like two minutes since lifting the bag.  I remember having a real, tangible feeling that I actually lifted the object through telekenetic force.  Maybe the strangest dream in many years.  I have not even tried to analyze it, it was just bizarre!

      A strange thing happened a few weeks ago.  Driving down Broadway, I noticed a young woman, early 20s maybe, in the next lane.  She was crying, sobbing uncontrollably, trying to stay in control but obviously in extreme despair.  I obviously don't know what happened.  Did she just get a call that someone died?  Did she just break up with a boyfriend?  I was immediately touched and sad for her, wishing I could do something for her, talk, listen, give a hug, whatever.  I realized I was staring, and looked away, not wanting to invade on her private sadness.  I would have been very embarrassed if she suddenly looked back at me, even though I knew I was basically invisible to her at that moment.  But I couldn’t help watching her try to cope with whatever had happened.  I feel like I remember her face from somewhere, maybe a photo on a desk here at the office, or maybe just seen around town.  So beautiful, but so sad at the same time.  I won't forget her for a long time.

      Apparently someone was charged with planning to blow up a mall in Columbus, Ohio.  Now I dislike terrorists as much as the next person, but this may go too far.  Who among us has not thought about blowing up at least one or two stores, if not the whole mall?  I know I have wanted to blow up Sears, Kmart, or Radio Shack several times in my life.  When you get screwed by a store, it is fun to contemplate, "What Would Arnold Do?"  He would blow their shit into next week, dammit.  When I worked at Longs, I imagined several times sitting on the hill above the store and sending a handheld missile into the front of the store.  Never to hurt anyone, just to see the place blow up.  If we can't dream about mayhem and destruction everyday without getting put in jail, the terrorists have won.

      Just to show it's not all about me, I will talk about Anne, who is going through some of her own work troubles.  She does home child care by herself in our home.  Her method of child care is child-directed, play-based and loosely scheduled, in which the kids get to do essentially anything they want (within appropriate bounds), learning and developing through play and social interaction with other kids.  This would be the exact opposite of the structured pre-school environment, in which there is a schedule and a lesson plan for what the kids are told to learn today.  Anyway, she is having a problem when parents choose to remove kids from her care and put them in a more traditional pre-school "so they can be ready for kindergarten".  When parents do this, she feels like it is her fault, like she is doing something wrong, like she needs to change what she does to reflect what the parents want, that she is hurting the children by doing what she does that makes the parents want to change, etc.  I tried to tell her that if she really believes she is doing the right thing, then she should not take it personal.  She cannot control what other parents feel or believe is best for the child.  She did the best she could for that child for the time they were in her care, and that's all one can ask.  She cannot decide if she wants to believe that or if she even wants to continue doing daycare. I think she feels like she cannot stop, or take a break, because the disruption would negatively affect the kids.    I think she is an extremely patient and caring person for doing child care, because I will be the first to admit I could never do it.  I think the part that bothers me about the little ones is the total dependency.  When they are older (like our kids), they can do things for themselves when you need a break.  But Anne does need a break, whether or not she will take one.  She won't "call in" sick, because it is difficult and inconvenient for the parents, even though it is usually a parent bringing a sick child that causes Anne to be sick.  She is stuck in a similar loop to me, i.e. "I have to be there for the kids, because they need good care, so I will put their needs ahead of my own".    At the end of the day, she has very little to no energy to deal with family needs, meaning kids and me, so she gets away from the house to do stuff on her own at least 2 nights per week.  I like to let her have that time, but I also struggle with lack of energy from my issues and wish I could have that time away as well.  When she does stay home, she generally does not want to do home chores, because she has been home all day running after kids.  When she does decide to do dishes/laundry/cleaning, it seems like it is always at 11pm or later, when I am ready for bed.  I try to fill in and do my share of things, but I feel like it is never enough, and I believe she thinks the same thing.    I think this is one of the basic problems between me and Anne at this time, even though neither of us really wants to address it.  (This is also why it is simply inconceivable to me that she is interested in another child - more about that later.)  I am not in any way saying that she should stay at home and cook and clean and not work - I don't believe that is fair to her, or any other woman in the same position.  All I am saying is that we need to address this problem, because I think that deep down, it is a real source of anger for her that hurts our marriage.

       This is a letter to an old friend I have wanted to write for a long time - I just can't find her to tell her myself.  I hope she finds this someday.   Dear Angie:  I've missed being your friend.  I'm really sorry that I acted immature whay back when we stopped speaking to each other.  After the thing with the ATM card, you needed someone to support you, and I should have been the one who did.  Unfortunately, I couldn't do that at the time.  I was hurt not necessarily about what you did, but more by the idea that if you needed help with money or anything else, I would have done it for you, but you never asked.  I felt like if you had betrayed one friend by stealing, you might betray me also.  It turns out I betrayed you by attacking you with all the others, without bothering to hear your side of the story.  At that moment, though, I was looking for a reason to stop seeing you.  Actually, I really wanted to get more involved with you, and a couple times I thought you would feel the same, but it never worked out.  For whatever reason you seemed scared to get too involved with me, and I was okay with that for a long, long time, but I had about reached my limit.  When the ATM thing came out, all my frustration about our relationship interfered with my reaction, and instead of offering to help and stay loyal to you, I decided to be mean to you instead to drive you away.  Well, it worked, and I have not heard from you or seen you in about 14 years.   I can't believe all that happenned in 1990.  I have tried to find you over the 'net a few times, but with no success.  I wanted to call you or visit or write to tell you all this, but I can't find you.  Chris thought he knew where you were at one time, but no luck.  So I am stuck posting this here, hoping that by some cosmic accident you find this and read it and contact me.  Bye, Angie, you know I always loved you, whether or not I knew how to show you.   -- R

      So here I sit Monday morning, dreading another day of work.  I almost drove the other way this morning.  A few blocks from the office, I had this barely controllable urge to turn off before I got within sight.  I don't know what I would have done, probably just sit and berate myself for being foolish.  So I continued to work, and pulled in the lot, and walked inside, and said perfunctory hellos, and got my coffee, and started working on computers, and started typing this entry, and wonder how the hell am I going to be productive today, when I simply don't want to be here?  Obviously, this is not just the Monday blues, but a continuation of last week's funk.  Anne and I were talking about this the other night.  I basically made her listen to me because I was so desparate, and she could tell.  Up until now I thought she really didn't understand what I am going through, but I the she is starting to.  She started talking about options how to pay for things on just her income for a month or 2.  She even suggested that maybe I could work 1/2 time for a while, allowing me to make some money, while having additional time for taking care of myself.  I think she understands now that I will go nuts without doing something different.  That is actually the best idea I have heard lately.  I have not thought it out very far, but maybe I could work about 4 hrs per day - not enought time to screw around or get distracted - and then have the afternoon to do projects at home, or take time for myself, write or talk to people, or whatever I need to do to help myself.  Just broaching this idea to my supervisor is (by my fucked-up rules) admitting failure, but out of anybody in management here, this person will understand and provide support.  If necessary, I may also be able to get my therapist to order me to cut back, thus taking the decision out of my hands.

      I have a very high anxiety level when trying to socialize at a gathering, such as the company picnic last weekend.  Usually I dread these gatherings because I just don't feel safe letting people past the outer defenses (hence the army of plastic cats - see my profile).  It is also hard for me to make trivial small talk, because it seems so trite and meaningless and silly.  So I end up mentally isolating myself from everyone else around me, internally retreating into a safe little cocoon where I can still be myself.  I can be totally, utterly alone in a room full of acquaintences, or even friends.    I remember my friends threw a suprise party for me when I turned 21, but even then I can remember feeling very alone for a few minutes.  Even though I was being shown by people that they liked and cared for me, I could not fully accept their feelings, as if at any moment they would all turn around and say "we made it all up, we don't really like you", the pig's blood would drop on me (image from  Carrie ), etc.  Someone sensed I was drifting away, and they came to me and physically/emotionally pulled me back into the present moment where they I did not have to be alone.  That has happened several times, and then other times I would desparately wish someone, whether a friend, or a "crush", would read my mind and come rescue me (because I would not tell them), but they never did.    Illogical line of reasoning # 325:    I feel like I have to constantly test others' love for me, and that if I don't constantly hear them telling me or feel the love, I start to question it.  If they do tell me or show me they love me, I start to question their sincerity or motives or intelligence.  I want love, but when I get it, I feel unworthy, so I must test their love, then when I get the answer that I want, I don't believe it.  If for some reason the other person doesn't respond the way I think they should, that confirms that they don't really love me.     I see how illogical this line of reasoning is.  If i can just learn to accept others' love, freely given, because they feel I deserve it, that should make me accept myself and like myself a little more.  I just cannot get past this fear of people being disingenuous, or betrayal, or someone's lack of ability to love me.  Hows that for a fear, kids?  I am afriad that someone doesn't love me because they are so messed up they may not have the capacity to love me, therefore I am not worthy of anyone's love.  Without realizing it, I accidentally/subconsciously wrote "fear of being left alone".  Is that all it is, just a fear that something will happen to everyone around me, and I will be left alone to cope (or not), whether by death, divorce, don't like/love me, or catastrophe, or ___?  I often tell myself I want to be alone, but deep down I really don't.  Deep down I want to be able to let people like or love me, to be able to accept and reflect those feelings, and to feel safe in letting people see a little bit of my emotional self.  How can I get over this fear?  I don't know...

      I was at Round Table the other night with the fam.  Anne and I are often people-watchers, and we happened to be watching an unlikely couple.  There were three guys, 20-ish, who looked like they were typecast for President, VP, and Secretary of the (D&D, Chess, Computer, take your pick) Club - they looked like total nerds (yeah, like I don't!).  Anyway, one of them looked like he was following a girl with his eyes, and later, gets up and follows her into the video-game room.  This girl, also around 20, is simply gorgeous - around 5'3", dark tan to olive skin, some non-white ethnic background, attractive figure, etc.  I thought, how creepy, is he trying to stalk her?  Then I realize she is talking to him, then they start sucking face like the asteroid is coming - get a room, kids, I'm trying to eat here!  My next thought is, wow, she is his girlfriend??!!  How did that happen?  He must have some sort of contract with Satan for that to have happened.    This just proves to me a few things: --that love can occur in the unlikeliest places --that inner beauty can still be appreciated by the physically attractive if they have a good heart --that I can be pretty dumb sometimes assuming I have people figured out when I really don't.

      Why do I feel like such a failure?  I don't know how I cam to establish "the rules" of my life, but I know that one of them is that to be satisfied with myself, I need to do it right or perfect every time, all the time.  Anything less than perfection equates to failure.  I have always been very confident in my ability to do things and reason through situations, but if I have problems I see that as a failure.  If I have potential to do sometihng right, but I don't, I have either wasted my potential or I haven't tried my hardest, both of which are greivous sins.  By these rules, how can I succeed at anything?  I have created a situation where I must fail almost every time, even when others see a partial or almost complete success.  I cannot trust anyone to do things for me because (by my rules) they will fail also, either through their own shortcomings or by my expectation of their performance holding up to my standard of perfection.  As a result of these rules, I feel like I have failed repeatedly in life, although when I logically step outside myself and look at the record, I hove accomplished some  good things in my life.  Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible for me to have any pride or satisfaction or sense of accomplishment in my near-successes.  I get no satisfaction at all for being intelligent, completing college, the ability to change careers, financial stability, stong love for my kids, etc.  It is like being in an art gallery, staring at the paintings, but feeling no sense of beauty at all, only emptiness.  In addition, what I am doing right now, writing about my problems, is very important to my sanity, but is also a source of guilt.  I am supposed to be working on a report right not, but I'm not.  This means I am trying my hardest or putting out my best effort, therefore I am failing not only myself but my employer.  Then I get paid for doing my job, so to get paid for wasting time and failing is essentially fraud.  I should be caught and fired the same as if I was stealing money from the company.  But I don't care about work right now.  I just want to get rid of the gray emptiness.  What is important to me, stupid work, or saving myself from destruction?  I know how fucked up this line of reasoning is, but I don't feel like I can ever escape it.

      I have a huge, gaping hole in my heart because I had no Dad to protect me, play with me, teach me.  I was adpoted by a single woman who lived with an abusive old woman.  I didn't need a perfect dad, just one who could be there.  I don't have anyone who can be strong for me in the rare moments when I can let down my guard.  I don't really have a rock I can lean on.  My best friend is the closest thing I have to a rock, but she is so far away, and she has her own life.  I have to be strong for everyone else around me, whether at home (emotional strength, dependable, provider, parent) or at work (dependable, trustworthy, productive).  I don't want to be any of those things, but if anyone else is around it is never OK to let myself be quiet, vulnerable, scared, sad, sick.  I only give myself permission to be that way when I am alone.  I think this is part of why I am so scared of people - I always need to put on a face for someone, including at home.    When I need emotional support from Anne, she has a hard time giving me what I need at that moment.  She loves me, she cares for me, but she won't talk to me when I really need it.  Last night I came home from work a nervous, anxious emotional wreck and basically cried myself into a nap.  I told her this later, and she kept right on quilting, acting like I had told her the car needed gas, or we were low on milk.  I poured a big glass of scotch and went to bed, passing out at about 10pm.  Later, around 2am, she woke me up to make love.  Sex feels good, of course, but more than anything I needed to explain why I felt like such a failure and why I almost ran away yesterday and why I miss the Dad I never had and why I need her to TALK TO ME!!!

      Nikki has been sad lately about her great-grandpa.  GG (Anne's grampa) died just before New Year's 2003, and we traveled to Goldville to attend the funeral.  Within the last year, she has been sad because she wishes GG could come back to see her.  Talking to her the other day, I think she feels bad because she does not really have any actual first-hand memories of GG, she only knows him from stories and from going to the funeral.  She said that she didn't want to hear stories from Anne or her parents, or see a video of his 80th b-day party, because it would still not be her memory.  She says sometimes that GG gets to see the tops of all the redwoods, or that he is talking to her in the wind (when the wind blows hard, he is reminding her she did something wrong), or that he gets to fly over everything.  She says this very matter-of-fact, not like a fantasy, which strikes me as un-childlike, almost a native-american manner of rememberance.  I felt so sad for her the other night, I had no way to help her feel better - a very powerless feeling.  I think she will grow out of it, but I also wonder if this will affect her notions of death and beyond.  Sometimes she acts 10 or more, sometimes she acts 4.  The average is her actual age, 7.

      I am very fidgety, like there is electricity flowing within me, waiting to jump out and fry everyone and everything around me.    Anyway, I had therapy today, and I was not in a talkative mood.  Essentially it comes down to the idea that I can never please myself.  No matter what I do, it is never good enough, I can never win, I can never be satisfied, everyone else will realize I am a fraud and a sham, that I should be fired from my job (current job or any other), that I don't earn my pay, that I am a bad parent, a bad husband, etc.  If I am not trying my best, I have failed.  If I slack off or make excuses or don't pull off a miracle like I sometimes do, I have failed.  Imperfection is all around, but I am the most imperfect of all, because I was given so much potential and have wasted it.   There this dark place inside me that is a dying little child crying to get out.  If he does not, the darkness will destroy me and everyone I love.  Every time I try to listen to this little child inside, he is smacked down by the Critic or the Worrier.  The Child can only sneak out during dreams or subconscious states, or sometimes when I have escaped my life.  The Child is awed by the beauty of the natural world: forests, mountains, streams, animals, flowers, granite, soil, oceans, wetlands.  Every day the Child is pushed down, he dies a little bit.  He has been surviving for almost 30 years, but there is very little energy left.  The Child, in order to live, needs me to run away from everything I have and give it freedom to explore and grow and live.    But I don't know how I can do this.  My family needs me, I need to be a provider, I need to work to survive in this world.  I can't just run away from it all.  That is what little kids do, right Annebrev?  Vacation doesn't help, it is only a momentary escape before diving back into the reality of working and eating and sleeping and avoiding meaningful conversations and struggling with parenting.  This process has brought me from miserable ignorance to seeing the edge of the barrier, whatever it is that keeps me from being whole.  The gulf between is huge, awesome, horrifying, impossible.  How can I ever cross?  I am so flat inside.  I might feel happy or soothed for a few minutes, but nothing replaces the overwhelming weight of this depression.  It is a cold, grey, damp blanket that smothers every spark of creativity or desire or motivation or happiness.  It is a force stronger than gravity, always present, always pulling downward, stronger than dreams or prayers.  I don't care about anything.  I don't care about ever being happy, about work, about home, about people, about succeeding, about dreams, desires, anything.  This life is my purgatory.  The Child cannot survive this asphyxiation much longer - he must escape or die.  If the Child dies, every shred of emotion and humanity and pleasure will die with him.  Then what will be left of me?  What will be there to fill the hole I leave behind?  Bitterness, anger, tears, sadness, unfulfilled promises, stolen years, missed milestones, photos, everything that makes a life.  The only thing that can save me is to run.  Can I expect Anne and the kids to let me run, then come back when I am ready?  Will they run with me, or will they care?  I don't want to be alone, but if I have to, so be it.  It does not matter.

      So I finally heard last night that Ronald Reagan had died.  Like it or not, his presidency defined the period of my teenage childhood, and changed the nation profoundly.  Was he a great president, or a great American?  Well, I guess the Russians never blew us up, so there's one in his favor.  But we later found out that all that time, all that energy, all that money was wasted, because all we had to do was wait for the Soviet Union to fall apart.  Maybe wasted is not the right word - the military made a great comeback, supported by running up a big deficit that I am now paying for.  Schools went in the tank, the environment took a back seat, too many adventures in foreign policy (gunboat diplomacy), the resulting resentment against Americans worldwide that continues to this day, ... yeah, thanks, Ronnie.  Instant Karma my ass.  John Lennon died, but Reagan lived, when both were shot.  Just think how different things might be if those results were reversed.

      The cleaning crew comes to our office Monday evenings, so the toilets are clean on Tuesday morning.  I don't know about other people, but to me one of the great pleasures of manhood is doing your business on a pristine, untouched, virgin toilet.  OK, I realize this may be a little weird, but I think the guys know what I'm talking about.  The men's room is one of the last places on earth where the sanctity of male relaxation is still firmly in place.  I have a few bathroom phobias anyway, not sure why.  I don't like multi-user bathrooms.  Not only do I like being in a bathroom by myself, but I like having TWO locked doors between me and the outside world.  Even better, a private bathroom with two locked doors surrounded by a locked gate in the middle of the woods.  I don't allow any family members in the bathroom with me.  The paper has to be OVER the roll, not under.  Whoever invented the little napkin-size square paper dispensers should be forced to use them forever.    There was an episode of Scrubs where there was a toilet on the roof.  If the door could be locked, I would go for it.  If there are any psychologists here, I'm sure that you can identify several Freudian theories about the obsession with the bathroom, so leave me a reference I can find.  I already know I'm messed up, but it would be interesting reading.  ===  OK, I have to do the boss' homework for his business class now.  I guess I am still the geeky kid from 4th through 10th grade who did stuff for people in a misguided attempt to gain approval, but now I get paid lots of money for the task.  Nyaaahhhh.

      The other day, I set mailbox limit warning messages for the first time.  I figure 5 MB is good enough for most users in an office environment, as long as they are maintaining their mailboxes correctly.  There was much weeping and gnashing of teeth, but I think most everyone here understands the need for reducing mailbox sizes, thereby reducing stress on the server.  I have one person, though, who (1) thinks he is the smartest individual on earth, (2) thinks it should be the sustaining job (i.e., my job) to "fix" the e-mail problem for him, and (3) sends me angry messages every day asking me to fix it for him.  He's a good guy, so I will "fix" it while trying to educate him a little.  In an office of 45 people, you can't really be the Asshole-IT guy, because everyone still knows you.  I imagine it is easier being a tyrant in a larger office (100+) when most people don't know you, and you can effectively hide behind the scenes and have people do your dirty work for you.  ===  We had the big company picnic and campout in the redwoods this weekend.  It went pretty well, no injuries or arrests, no brawls, only limited drunken debauchery (and I missed that part), and a few Sasquatch sightings.  Oh, that was just Dennis.  I was in charge of breakfast Sunday morning, and it was excellent.  Saturdays lunch-dinner was good - shitloads of bbq tri-tip and potluck side dishes and desserts.  The people who stayed overnight included the potheads and the lushes, and me and family, and one other couple (who think their dogs are their kids, which bugs the crap out of me).  Ordinarily I hate these functions, but I think I am starting to act in a more genuine way as far as being comfortable and secure as myself, whoever that is, instead of being my "Work Character" for everyone.  I was worried a little - see my earlier post.  In fact I never did what I considered:    ...when the fun is over I will just collapse into the dust and drool a lot, then wake up with dirt caked onto my face...   A few other people did just that, however.  Daniel got to play Frisbee (oh excuse me, DISC) and volleyball with the adults, and he did just fine.  He is becoming a big kid now.  Nikki, who was mad at her bike for several months (after learning to ride w/o training wheels), started riding again with very little effort.

      I work at a not-quite-small engineering and geology consulting firm locally (not naming names in case someone is googling for my company).  We have about 45 people that do a wide variety of things.  We have doubled in size in the 5+ years I have been here, and there have been growing pains.  This also comes at a time when I personally have been in the depressional tank, bothered by career angst, lack of self-worth, restlessness, disrespect for authority, occasional job-hunting, etc.  Looking objectively, I have a pretty good job, though.  I was originally an environmental engineer (mostly underground tank cleanup), then a civil engineer (mostly grading, drainage, stormwater, erosion control, road design), and now part engineer, part Drafting Manager, and full-time IT manager.  I always was the "computer guy". but in the last 3 years I have solidified and defined that position here.  I wear many hats, I am a "fixer" who makes himself valuable by doing many things relatively well, and apparently the company values my talents.  I still am getting paid, at least, and they were willing to allow me to transfer to the IT position.    Anyway, that is the setup for all the workplace posts that may follow, starting today.

      The other night, Daniel had a concert with his band at school.  Theye are 5th and 6th graders, but they are pretty good.  Dan plays percussion now after trying the trumpet last year.  The main reason for his switch was that the instrument was too heavy.  Good thing Beethoven never said the same thing.  Anne and I were picking out kids in his group who reminded us of people from our band days in high school.  We met in high school band, I played tuba, trombone, baritone, and she was in the flags/banners.  I was a band geek (it's no longer politically correct to say band fag, although that's what we were called) since 5th grade myself, starting on trumpet and switching to low brass when I got braces (ouch).  My mom also payed trumpet for 4 years in high school in the 50's.  Nikki has musical talent, but she is not really interested in lessons yet.  She has pitch memory and can pick out and memorize almost any sone, including key changes, and hit them right on.  I am very impressed.  She probably will learn piano and do choir, but you never know what kids will choose.  The harpsichord is a silly musical instrument.  I can get very similar sounds with a series of rubber bands and pie plates.  Baroque music irritates me, for the most part.  If I were stranded with a musician in winter, I would want them to play string instruments.  Not for the music, though.  I can start a fire using the violin for kindling, keep myself warm with the cello, and cook the musician over the coals of the string bass.

      I go to therapy weekly, and this week I told the doc about my new fascination with blogging.  I described to her that I was using it as a diary or journal, although it is as if I was tearing the pages from my journal and mailing them to someone who puts them up in a train station in some random city.  That is an odd metaphor, but as good as any, I guess.  This is semi-public but relatively anonymous, so I feel like I can say things here that I would not say out loud to all but a few people in the world.    Obviously a few people have stopped here to read, so I realize I may or may not have someone reading everything I say.  Occasionally I write something that I hope people will respond to, but usually it is just an outlet for my thoughts.  I'm writing for me, after all, with the purpose of exploring and illuminating the dark corners of the brain, and trying to make sense of it all.  After reading several other blogs, I get the sense that there are many other people that have a similar attitude.  Well, the boss is nosing around, so I need to look busy.  ... blah blah blah  ...  Woodford Lane ascends a moderately steep drainage course with a southwest slope aspect (Figure 2). The traveled roadway is paved and slopes approximately 15 percent to the southwest. A relatively small, but unknown quantity, of uncompacted sidecast fill is present alongside the edge of pavement.  ... yeah, that looks like typical work text.  Company picnic and overnight campout this weekend.  We have about 45 people, plus families, so we rented an entire campground about 1 hour away.  It could be interesting, stressful, disgusting, infuriating, ... or I could just stop worrying about stuff and say fuck it, I'm getting liquored up and having fun.  I'm not an embarrassing drunk, I'm usually a comatose drunk, so when the fun is over I will just collapse into the dust and drool a lot, then wake up with dirt caked onto my face.  OK bloggers, that was fun.  Hi Fiat Lux, Hi annebrev, have a smashing weekend...

      I'm really too busy for blogging today, I have a ton of stuff to do and I know I won't get it done today.  But I wanted to get something, ANYTHING, in writing today.  Getting paid is really cool, especially when it is $24 per hour.  I have always felt that my current income is the result of a combination of hard work, luck good and bad, and making good decisions.  I have had problems in the past with being guilty about making money when other people have little or no opportunity or luck and are dirt poor, struggling all the time.  That's how I grew up, so I am familiar with poverty.  I want to impress upon my kids the good fortune they have to not have to worry about food or clothing or electricity, but I don't want them to feel guilty about it like I do sometimes.  When I am in a depression spiral, I start obsessing about work, that I have trouble concentrating therefore I'm not being a good employee, I'm not earning my money, I'm a fraud, and so on.  I don't really know what the answer is there.  I have a serious problem allowing myself to feel like I earned whatever I get without feeling guilty about my success or that anything less than total success is a total failure.  I have a habit of saying that a chimp can do my job, that I can be replaced tomorrow, just perpetuating my insecurities and adding stress that I don't need.  While I've met some smart chimpanzees, I am learning to take pride in the fact that my work DOES have value and IS challenging and IS worth getting paid good money for.  However, this does not change the fact I don't really like my old or new job (new duties in same company), and I have many other related issues.  I'm just not happy working right now, because I sense that it is the least important to me in terms of what I want to focus my energy on.  I really want to be a wildlife or wetlands naturalist or study native American culture or a bus driver or a million other things than what I am doing now..  I have a good rant from a few months back about my sense of value related to my so-called career, so I will look for that and post it when I get time.

      In between billable work, I am creating a list of things that would be difficult and/or dangerous to juggle, especially in various combinations.  My list so far:  Running chainsaw Live grenade Bobcat or Possum Flaming torch Jellyfish Samurai sword Ming dynasty vase Rattlesnake Flask of cyanide (or any nasty chemical or biological agent) Ebola-infested livers  Do you have anything to add to this list?  Feel free to contribute.

       She's not yet 7, but it's like I have a little teenager on my hands.  I love her to pieces, but she will be a real challenge.  Anyway, two pages from her journal.   One night I was reading a book called One Tiny Turtle.  Then my dad came home, then I went outside to write.  Then my mom, dad, and brother were talking too much and I could not think, so I could not write because I could not think.   One night I was having fun with music until my dad took over the music.  Then I started to cry.  So from this day on I will not put on music when my dad is with me.

      In the interest of full disclosure, dear reader, you should know that some names and details have been changed to protect the innocent.  For example, I may or may not be named Rick, but it works for me.  I would not shout to everyone on the street my address, kids names, when I am home, stuff I own, etc.  If you give away too many personal details, an anonymous stranger suddenly has enough information to start stalking you in the analog world.  In addition, maybe I don't want people who know me to suddenly discover my life story (and maybe salacious gossip about them) on the web.  I will be genuine and honest (to myself primarily, and to the blog community as a whole) in sharing my thoughts and experiences.  But being a chronically paranoid person, you will understand if I don't let the defenses down entirely.  If you try to storm the castle, the tiny plastic cats will be unleashed...

      I HATE fucking architects!! Stop giving me site drawings in fucking inches! Stop changing the  ENTIRE FUCKING SITE  and then expect me to change my grading plan without additional time or money! Thanks for keeping up until  3 o'fucking clock  last night, all of it wasted. Stop writing in that  pretentious  so-called architect font that no one can read and  everyone hates !!! Stop wasting  my FUCKING tax money  on overdesigned, overblown monuments to yourselves, for a fucking  dog pound  or for other county buildings. Stop thinking you are  so FUCKING special  and that our lives would be shit without you!!!!  Bee-yatch!  (ok, rant over, back to work) (if you are an architect, nothing personal, but if the shoe fits...)

      Another baby? are you nuts? #1, physiologically impossible if I'm involved, and #2, I thought we agreed we didn't want more kids when I got clipped!  More about this later.  Sunburn on the tops of your feet really sucks.  There are a lot of little tiny rocks at the beach, more than, say, 100?  Duh?  When Anne says "I think I know what you are thinking", it just might scare the shit out of her to know what I am really thinking sometimes.  I should tell her the real, honest fucking truth sometime just to get her attention.  DO NOT try to figure me out, it cannot be done.  In my next life, I want to do nothing but play baseball.  I would be happy to be good enough to toil in the minor leagues for 10 years.  My therapist is making it all up as she goes.  She really has no clue about me.  Canadian Bacon was really funny on many levels.  Anne swears she doesn't have my testicles in her purse - maybe they will be found next to the weapons of mass destruction.  Dan is fun to take to a "grown-up" movie.  We saw The Day After Tomorrow, the day before yesterday.  It was entertaining in a "nature will get her revenge on our insignificant asses" sort of way, riveting in spots, although it was so implausible that I almost laughed in a few spots.  Gosh, LA destroyed AGAIN, how original :-*   The wave hitting Manhattan was pretty impressive, though, in that they showed the West Side hwy and all the streets filled with cars in a traffic jam, and the water just covered them all, one million people dead in a matter of seconds.  Still, nobody noticed this wave coming??  Hello, offshore bouys!!  The young girl (whoever she is) had a very sexy voice - she sometimes dropped into a lower octave, totally changing the mood of whatever she said.  I am still pissed at Dennis Quaid for stealing Meg Ryan from me - I was available at the time, after all.  Damn that Innerspace movie!  Hi, annebrev - you wrote me back! :-)  I'll e-mail later.

      it's tomorrow on the edge of the continent. the silent moon radiates its cold light, highlighting silver ripples on the resting ocean. the shoreline murmurs to me like a lover in its sleep.  kids sleeping, dreaming of horses, games,  the future like an empty book without words, waiting; parents gladly worry about the details to protect their kids for just one more day.   the water doesn't ask how i feel, what i know, what i'm proud of, what i wish i could leave behind. the silver, shimmering water promises eternity, no cares, no worries, no expectations.   sleep eludes my eyes, for a while, shyly waiting as my mind lets go of the disappointments of another hour, another year, another step closer to letting dreams go (for expediency's sake)   i hear my resting lover urging me closer but my heart feels the cold lie in the warm whispers i hear her promise, but i fear the eternity of a watery tomb, crushing, silent, black.   tonight, once more, i choose the compromise of life over the cold depths of her embrace; i will see the sun once more.  but every night the choice is getting harder, her promise just a little more enticing, eternity not so long, the depths not so dark.   how long will i wait to answer her call? tomorrow, will i go to my cold lover's heart? The silent moon will show me the way.

      Anne, why is it you and I seem to be on the same schedule when we feel good or bad?  Very strange.  The times when we most need someone's comfort is the time when we are least able to receive it, pushing our loved ones away, or give comfort to others who need it.  What I really need is to just lay down and be held all weekend, talk out problems, be loved by someone who understands this hell.  Instead, we will be occupoed with busy-tasks all weekend long, and I will be resentful and bitter the whole time.   I know most people think of me as cold, uncaring, unconcerned with other's problems.  If it didn't hurt so much to take care of myself, I would do more for others.  I would love to feel good enough and strong enough to be able to do more to help other people.  I want to be able to show love to my family all the time.  I just can't do it right now.  Either they understand, or they don't.

      It is getting late, the weekend fast approaching, and I feel myself starting down the spiraling path again.  I am so mentally tired.  All the good feeling of the last few days had disappeared, and I can feel the weight of my thoughts taking hold, pulling me inexorably downward.  This sounds really pathetic and weak and self-defeating.  I don't care, welcome to the last 25 years of my life.  I am so unmotivated for work right now.  I really don't care a lot about anything other than getting better and improving my life.  I realize this fight against depression is the most important thing in my life right now.  I think that as long as I need to work, I will not have the energy I need to get better OR to be better at work.  I am beyond feeling guilty or stressed about work.  I am beyond wanting to move to another job.  I do feel pretty pathetic about the state of my career accomplishments.  I just feel like I am trapped by the paycheck, like so many other people.  I feel bad about having a well-paying job and having this problem.  I feel bad that I am wasting opportunity and talent fucking around at work, while other people with less opportunity and worse luck struggle to feed themselves and their families.  Kim says "why don't you just do something different?"  I could, but I am scared of failure, worried about the money, have a huge fkn mortgage, and so on.  What would we do while I decided to retool, retrain, and start from the bottom as a 34-yr-old rookie at something?  How can we possibly afford the life we have created if I am not earning the primary income?   What would I do?  I think I could write professionally, but it takes so much effort and perserverance and a little luck to get noticed.  Where do you start?  How do you get noticed?  There are a million people trying to be writers, what makes me think I could get chosen by someone?  I don't have any formal training in writing, or computer science, or biology, or wildlife, or mapping, or any of the things I would really enjoy.  It is possible I could find some sort of service job where I deal with one of those interests.  I am definitely at a cross-roads, but I am too afraid to take any side roads.  I used to be decisive and well-informed about potential decisions.  I feel like I have lost the ability to make big life-changing decisions, because I really just don't care.  I can see the boring, straight, smooth road ahead, the path of least resistance, that leads to either the mental hospital or worse.  I wish I knew how to break out of this.  I suppose this is partly depressive thinking, but this is also just being realistic about my life.  I am not making good decisions right now about anything.  I guess I will see if I can get better internally, then start working on career.  I can't wait for winter rain and cold.

      My current good mood reminds me of one time in high school.  Normally I would hang out near the band room (I hear y'all saying GEEK or BAND FAG), but near the end of my senior year I was getting tired of that scene, I needed a change, I needed to feel something different.  Also, I was relatively happy the last half of that year, I had a few good friends, doing well in school, coming out of a shell socially.    One particular day, Alyssa and I and maybe someone else (Jason or Rich?) spent the majority of lunch sitting in the quad, typically the hangout of the "in crowd" and very much the social focal point.  Normally I avoided this place, but on this day the grass was a little greener, the April sun warming me inside and out, and I was encouraged rather than unnerved by the sound of people laughing and chatting.  I ate a thick chocolate milkshake with M&Ms, the candy freezing hard, crunching in my mouth.  We joked, we watched people, we talked about whatever.    The library guy had rolled out a stereo system and big speakers, typical for springtime.  Led Zeppelin IV was playing.  It was the first time I had really listened to the song Stairway to Heaven.  I felt every note. I was very quiet, taking it all in, seeing what I had missed out on during my self-imposed exile from the rest of the world, saving the memory like a video in my brain.  Alyssa asked me if I was ok - I must have drifted off into my mindscape again.  Yeah, I'm OK.  I have my best friend, I'm not nervous, I feel music, I feel alive.

      One ongoing problem is the communication block between Anne and I. One of my fortune-cookie maxims is that "Communication only occurs when the message received is the same message that was sent, and the sender knows the message was received." I was discussing this with the therapist yesterday. I think I have tried to Anne my thought or fears or problems, and I think she hears me, but I don't get the feedback I need to let me know she understands, or she doesn't and I need to say more. On the other side, I think that because of my depression I have not been very receptive to listening or receiving her messages. I think that she could make more of an effort to let me know what is in her mind, because trying to read her mind has not been very successful.     The shrink says that she has rules for when it is time to 'talk turkey' (her words). Among the rules are that you only speak truth, which may be uncomfortable for one or both people, but do not make judgments about or blame the other person. I think this is major stumbling block for me. One of my favorite coping mechanisms through life has been to avoid confrontation, and avoid rocking the boat. I think I would rather not say potentially uncomfortable things which may cause damage to our relationship, and instead keep it all in to avoid causing a problem. I suppose it may be a minor discomfort now, but wait a few years and see how these non-spoken issues grow very large and very painful to deal with. I am also afraid of the worst-case scenario, where we finally decide to say nothing but the truth, and it turns out that the truth hurts so much we can not recover. That would be worse for me than holding it all in and self-destructing.     Having said this, I think we will be OK in the end, but it will be painful getting there.

      I have been feeling pretty good for a few days now.  That is hard to believe, considering the depth of the downward spiral I was mired in last week.  It feels really good to feel better.  I am doing stuff with the kids, there is less tension, they are not stressed trying to figure out my behavior, I am not being overly picky or critical or intolerant.  It is in these moments when I think I can see a future where I am in control of the depression, rather than it being in control of me.    I still have a hard time concentrating at work, but maybe I just feel less guilty about it at the moment.  Let's shelve that for now.     I am writing this in the living room on my laptop.  I tried to start at 9:20 when I sent the kids to bed.  They interrupted me several times until 10pm, when Anne came home.  I gave up until 11:30 when she went upstairs, then Nikki comes out at 11:40, then I have to investigate what the cat is dooing at 11:50.  Too many sounds, too many noises, too many people around.  PLEASE just leave me alone and let me write.  When I write, everything feels better.

      I went to the M.D. today. My old doc moved away, so I had to find someone new, but in the same office due to the HMO plan. When making the appointment, I asked for someone who was knowledgeable about depression, anxiety, and migraines. The person said "Oh, all the doctors here know about that." No, I mean really know, so I don't have to wait for them to figure out what to do with me. I think I lucked out, and they listened to me. I ended up with the new doc, a relatively youngish woman, who seems knowledgeable and understanding. She made me feel relatively comfortable talking about my problems, and seemed informed about the different medicines. Normally I end up seeing a male doc, but the last two now have been women. I have absolutely no problem with that, and I think women are better able to actually listen to a patient and be a partner with the patient, as opposed to some male docs I have met who are arrogant know-it-alls. As long as they don't tell me to turn my head and cough, everything will be fine.     Anyway, we discussed how the Celexa was not working for me. I have been at 40mg for about 3 months. She agreed that if I was still having that much difficulty with depressive spirals, that the medicine obviously is working very well. I gave her the 5-minute life history of my illness, and she thought that since I have both symptoms of depression and anxiety, Effexor has worked well for that combination of problems. So I will try to survive going off one pill, then starting another. I have read of people going 3 or 4 weeks with no medicine waiting for one chemical to get out of the body and the new one to take effect. Apparently I can stop the Celexa within 6 days, then immediately begin with the Effexor. The initial dose is 37mg, then 75mg, then more if needed. Hit me, baby, I need a bunch.     BTW, I can't seem to say Effexor without doing a superhero-type dum-dum-DAAAAAA sound effect.

      Dammit, I have been invaded by piss ants overnight.  They found lunch trash in my garbage can.  Instead of an ant trail, I found the Bayshore Freeway, 10 lanes of ants, toll booths, highway patrol, two ants trying to run an insurance scam, and prostitue ants on the exit ramps.  I was fascinated for about 7.2 seconds, then the carnage began.    I think ants freak out when they find other dead ants.  I have noticed that the smell of dead piss ants is a deterrant to use of the trail. In our old house I had killed an ant, and left the carcass on the trail as a warning to the others.  One ant found the body and started freaking out.  I thought he was going to eat his buddy, but instead he did a little st. vitus dance, spun around a few times, and rolled over in agony.  He stopped moving a few minutes later.  Very fascinating.  I wonder if the ants have some sort of collective consciousness, and actually have "sympathy" for the dead?  Here we go, anthromorphizing again.

      I have been reading (ok, more like skimming) a book called The Dark Side of the Inner Child. The author studied in India for a while, so the book is about 75% Eastern philosophy and concepts that are probably valid ideas, but my narrow Western brain has a hard time wading through. Anyway, the primary thing I have gotten from the book is the concept of the inner child (which he says is often misused in western psychotherapy). I basically agree with his description of "trances" that reflect the age when something traumatic happened, related to my own experiences. The trances are similar to the concept of coping mechanisms, which may have worked for a traumatized child at that age, but as adults, those mechanisms are no longer appropriate responses to non-existent but perceived traumas (ties in to the cognitive distortions: paranoia, awfulizing, negative self-talk,etc.)     This concept fits rather well with my current "working model" for my depression. I think that I developed coping mechanisms (trances) at various ages which worked for various occasions. I kept operating under those false mechanisms when the threat had ended, but I perceived it to still exist. Eventually the distorted behaviors became habitual and ingrained into my personality, my "character" I play every day (usually far from the "real" me). Now that things are different and I no longer need to operate under those conditions, I will need to make an effort to reverse the habitual behaviors I have developed over 25 years or so.     God, that sounds easy. Time's up, that will be another $90. If it were so easy to make those changes, don't you think I would have done so already?? I think that 15 years ago, maybe soon after Lilas (the Old Bitch) left, I would have benefited from dealing with these issues in a therapy setting. Instead, I just kept things inside, talking only to a very few close people (Anne and Alyssa both helped get me though) over time but never really dealing with the problem. I just kept those few boxes sealed up, stuffed in the mental attic for more and more time, knowing they were there but never having the courage to open those boxes and finally throw the shit away. I finally realized about 6 months ago that NOT opening those boxes would be potentially more painful in the long run, and that in order to *survive (not exaggerating) I would have to deal with those issues, no matter how painful.     Now that I am starting to accept new possibilities, I need to start believing I can get better. There is a big difference between accepting that UFOs are possible, or believing that they exist, or seeing one land in the front yard. For a long time, I have felt that the "happy people" live in an ignorant, brainless dream world. Now I can accept the possibility that some of those people have had problems, but they figured out how to put their past behind them and chose to lead a sincere, well-adjusted life. It will take some time before I become one of those people, not necessarily happy but at least at peace with their life, but maybe I am starting to believe it can happen.     Finally, I am starting to believe the concept that the thoughts cause the illness, not necessarily the other way around. Up until this second, I have been saying "the beast" is in control. Can it be that The Beast is really more of a Sasquatch, alive in the imagination but with no tangible proof of it's existence? Can it be possible that The Beast is nothing more than the sum of all my illogical fears and manufactured coping mechanisms? If this is so, then if I can de-bunk the myth of the beast, piece by piece, stripping away each individual distortion and fear and negative thought, maybe it will just be a little man behind a curtain, pulling my levers but with diminishing effectiveness until ... I free myself, and get on with my life I left behind at age 15 or so.     So here I am. This is me, right now, today, older, flabby, sitting in my Hanes and writing my life story. If I have a choice, there will be many more chapters to write. I am a product of my experiences, good and bad; the people I have interacted with, good and bad; and the choices I have made, again good and bad. But I am more than that, or else I would be no better than a troupe of monkeys. I have the ability to move on; to break old, bad habits; to take better care of myself mentally and physically; to accept the past as the past and not let it rule my life anymore.     I remember being mean to someone 15 years ago, does that mean I am a bad person today? I made a dumb mistake 1, 2, 5, 10 years ago, last week, or maybe 5 minutes ago, does that make me an idiot? I didn't make an effort to keep up a friendship, does that mean I should never make any more friends? Only if I choose to see it that way. I think I finally can start believing that I do have choices to make, not necessarily the choices I thought I was missing, but other, more fundamental choices that determine the rules I will choose to live by: those of the Old Bitch, my self-imposed martial law, or a new set of rules that I have not written yet.

      I hate any kind of scented shampoo, and I continually struggle to find a "manly" shampoo that does not smell like anything but clean.  So this morning, half-asleep in the shower, I realize I am all out.  I had to use Anne's 'poo, which was scented with passion flower or strawberries and gorse or something like that.  Ugh, I've been violated!  I feel like I was accosted by the Queer Eye guys in my sleep.  Not only that, I have been obsessing over repeatedly saying "methylisothiozolinone".  I don't know what it is, but it's a wicked cool word.    BTW, I want to market a line of guys hygeine products, plain packaging with military-type stencil writing, with no smell or color or perfume of any kind - just soap, just shampoo, just toothpaste, etc.  Anyone with connections to the big companies, let me know and let's make some money.    Yesterday at work, I was working on someone's computer, when one woman asks two other women for  a feminine hygeine product .  The scary part is, I didn't even flinch until about 30 seconds later, and thought  HEY, GUY IN THE ROOM !    This is on top of my recent depression spiral.  I always end up feeling like a drama queen afterwards, not strong and manly at all.  Dammit, I need to barbecue some meat and tear apart a car to feel better.    I want to market a line of guys hygeine products, plain packaging with military-type stencil writing, with no smell or color or perfume of any kind - just soap, just shampoo, just toothpaste, etc.    OK, the truth is I like women more than men.  I enjoy their company and enjoy talking with women, because they are in general smarter, more genuine,  and less preoccupied with genitalia than men.  Men are always trying to be the "top dog", pissing on stumps and growling at each other, and it bugs the crap out of me.  I love women with style, grace, and personality.  I love the way some women just smell perfect and sensual all the time.  I just don't like the perfumey smell when it is on me.

      I saw the  urlLink Bourne Supremacy  yesterday.  I enjoyed it a lot - very fast, tense thriller from start to finish.  This film (like the first) has a very European feel to it, from the scenery to the shot selection to the soundtrack to the vehicles.  There are a few humorous turns, but they usually precede some bas-ass action by Bourne.  Matt Damon IS Bourne, without a doubt - another good acting job.    Not to give anything away, but you could tell after the first 10 minutes that the movie was in no way based on the book.  Having read all 3 books in the series, I know that they are interdependent on each other.  The way the movie started, it was clear that the remaining 90% of book number 2 and all of book 3 were no longer possible.  OK, fine, once I got over that, I enjoyed it.  I think I liked the first movie better because it was the first, and the audience discovered along with the characters what was happening.  In this one, the only person who doesn't know what is going on ... is Bourne.  The guy selling popcorn knew more than the main character did.  The premise was already in place from the first film, and the second added very little to the persona of Bourne, other than just another problem to solve for the same character.  I'm sure there is a film term for this plot device, but it is essentially "Wheels are alrady in motion, drop the poor schmuck into the situation and see if he gets ground up into a chicken pie".  The first movie was more true to Ludlum's novels in that regard.  Finally, some of the effects and chase scenes are simply beyond the realm of possibility, given the structural limits of funky Russian taxis against souped-up Mercedes sedans and the frailty of the human body.    Enough complaining, i'm being way too picky.  It was great!  B+.

       I wondered what was the right way to tell her more about my depression, but talking to a 7-yr-old can be a challenge.  So I wrote this down, we read it together, and talked about it a little, then she kept the paper to read again if she wants.  I hope it helps her understand.     Nikki,    I wanted to tell you why I am sad or mad so much.  I am sick right now.  It is called depression.  I have had this disease since I was 8 or 9 years old.  I won’t die, or need to go to a hospital because of this disease.  Instead of making my body sick, it takes over my brain, my thoughts and feelings.  I call it “the beast”.  It is like I have two people in my body - the real me, and the beast.    The beast is in control of me a lot.  The beast makes me think and do mean things.  It makes me want to hurt myself and be alone.  It makes me want to run away sometimes.  It makes me not want love from anyone.    You did not do anything to cause me to be sick.  Please, please do not blame yourself.  You are not the cause of my hurt.  Remember I told you about the mean old woman who hurt me and my Mom?  This is all her fault.    The real “me” is the Dad that you like to talk to, and play games with.  The real me is in control when I am happy, laughing, and patient.  The real me loves you very much and wants you to grow up into a strong happy person.      I try every day to fight the beast inside my brain.  Sometimes I win, but often I lose.  I am trying very hard, I am seeing a doctor, I am taking medicine, and I am reading lots of books to learn how to fight the beast.    You can help me fight the beast.  You can help me by being kind and showing love.  You can help me by having respect for me and Mom, and listening when we tell you to do things.  You can help me by choosing to brush teeth and get ready for bed without being slow or ignoring me.  You can help by not fighting with Daniel.  I don’t need you to be sad for me, because that will not help me or you.      It always makes me feel better when you sit with me to talk about stuff, or to ask questions, or to just give hugs.    I know you are a good person, and I know you do not hate me, even when you get mad and say that.  Please always remember that I love you no matter what, and I will try very hard to control the beast.  I don’t want to do anything to make you sad.

      Well, Anne and I are talking again, mostly light stuff, nothing serious, certainly nothing about the aborted runaway attempt.  Maybe she feels the best way to deal with it is to ignore it.  Maybe she is right, and I am making too much out of it.    What if I did the same thing?  I had a weak moment and took off in a rush to calm myself down.  Did I hurt anyone?  (actually, yes, hurt her feelings very badly, and maybe hurt our relationship as well).  Did I do something crazy or foolish or mean?  (foolish yea, crazy maybe, mean - up for interpretation.)   Is it possible to allow myself to just let that moment go, like burning toast or spilling milk?  It was 'The Beast' in control, not the real me.  But I think the reality is, the real me has to deal with the fallout caused by the Beast.  I think it is not a simple as "forget about it, move on" when it affects other people, my family.    I am reading a book from Anne Sheffield, about how the family of the depressed person is affected.  I started reading it to get a sense of Anne's perspective, what she might be thinking dealing with me.  Maybe I will try to get her to read it.  Also, I think she needs to have a session or two with the therapist, with or without me, whether she likes it or not.    Related to this, I had a talk with Nikki tonight.  She was being very nice.  She senses things are not right, just like Dan.  Anyway, a few days ago I had written her a letter she could understand about me problems.  I think it went well, I hope it helps her understand better.  (See next post for letter.)    Anyway, I am in a better mood, partly due to feeling useful at work, also because I have worn out the depressive side for a few days.  I don't have any self-pity left for now.  After watching the movie yesterday, I am going to be more decisive, and be a bad-ass if I need to be (okay, maybe just look at people when I talk to them).  When there is a situation, I will ask myself, What Would Bourne Do?  WWBD.    Someone just came into my office without knocking.  WWBD?  Smash his face with my coffee mug, keep everyone back with a gun, steal his car and race down Broadway, leaving destruction in my wake.  Everything will be better tomorrow.  OK, maybe that is not the best policy for now.

       Maybe the saddest thing I've ever written.      I touch your skin as you lay beside me I want to feel something wonderful there Love, support, understanding, empathy  Instead I feel anger, sadness, guilt, resentment, fear flowing from your skin to my fingers like acid numbing my nerves, my arms, my soul  your pain goes straight for my heart like tiny daggers, each little stab  adding to the hurt and shame I already feel  how can I make things better for you, for us when you won’t talk to me?  All you give me  is love, mixed with tears and anguish and silence  do you have your own demons too,  or are mine reaching out to pull you in? the experts tell me that’s how it works  we are in deep trouble, I’m afraid you can’t heal, because I can’t feel anything but falling, drowning, dying     welcome to my darkness.

      OK, Monday.  No big deal, after this weekend.  I was here 10+ hours yesterday doing computer stuff, and I have been fixing stuff for everyone all morning.  I think I am much better when I am busy and fixing many small things - as opposed to working for days on one big problem.  I am so juvenile right now.  I have the attention span of a 3-year-old, with about the same social skills.  Honestly, some days I feel like I relate to teenagers better than adults, bacause in a sense I am emotionally in that same tumultuous state (minus the acne and hormonal changes, thankfully).   Oh look, a funny.  I have not had much humor for several days; its return is a sign I am improving somewhat.  However, I am still weighted down by what happened.  I will struggle to deal with it, and Anne's reaction to it, for a long time, methinks.  I hope to sneak away and watch the Bourne Supremacy this afternoon.  I really liked the novels, and the 1st Bourne movie was great.  Matt Damon is so much better than his inept, cheesball friend Ben Affleck.  Another great movie - The Talented Mr. Ripley.  I saw Matt throw out the first pitch at a Red Sox game 2 years ago.

      I am at the office today.  My primary reason is to upgrade the database file for the accounting software, then transfer the database to a dedicated server (not really a "server", but the details are not really important).  However, it is a really good excuse to avoid hanging out all day with Anne's parents and brother from Goldville.  They were going to the tiny zoo here in town and the beach later.  I wanted no part of that, and since we didn't get invited to breakfast, I told Anne I was heading for work sometime, I may as well go.  That was at 11 am, and then I screwed around reading blogs for 2 hours.  I can't decide if I am getting better or worse.  I sense that since my depression cycles are getting dangerously worse lately, maybe I need a different therapist, different or more medicine, or some combination of the above.  Reality is that I like my therapist, I think she has a good sense of what I am going through, but then again sometimes I find myself censoring or either minimising or inflating whatever I tell her.  Are things as bad as I tell her?  Are they worse?    The last session I told her about several dreams about death, and eventually she asked me if I had ever had suicidal thoughts.  "Well, maybe" I answered meekly, basically only mentioning that I had thought about shitloads of pills, leaving out the ideas about steak knives, the ocean, large buses (mental picture - Bill Murray in Groundhog Day), intentional exposure and hypothermia, etc.  I said I didn't really want to admit it or think about it.  When I told her that, she said quietly "Thank you for telling me that" and continued as if it had never happened.  I'm no dummy, and I know a psych job when it is being used on me.    Thank you??  I guess she was trying to trick me into thinking I needed permission from myself to tell her that.  I mentally prickled at that, but I let it go at the time, but really that is the only thing I remember from the session.  Another $90 down the shit-hole, $20 of which I pay directly.  Anyway, she said don't play with my dosage either, as I told her occasionally I took a little extra Celexa.  Oh, database is done and waiting patiently.  Or, maybe it is silently mocking me for my shabby appearance, my big butt, or my mental problems.  Damn, anthromorphizing onto my computers again, need to stop that.  Mood: solitary but slightly better, not run-away freaked out, just waaaayyy to nervous.  Need scotch.  Music: guns&roses, appetite for destruction.  Great 80's hard rock.  I wanna watch you bleed...

      That basically sums it up at the moment.  It was nice to have other people in the house for simple fact that it distracts Anne from sitting and thinking about the other night (OK, she has Big Brother also) so I can ruminate in mental isolation.  Still have thoughts of self-inflicted pain, but more emotional rather than physical.  After reading W. Styron's short book on his depression, I keep thinking about where he says he improved dramatically in a hospital just because he was in a structured environment where the only demands placed on him were to feel better.  Sounds great, if I had a boatload of money and could afford to take off work and have no demands, I would have done it long ago.  If was considering suicide (I'm not), I can see the need for supervision, but unless I win the lottery, that will be a luxury I cannot afford.

      I’ve crossed a threshold, gone too far outside the line, too close to the edge.  Anne is trying to pretend nothing happened, but she’s not a good actor.  We have said only a bare minimum, and only about mundane things, not a word about the gorilla sitting quietly in the corner of the room.  She won’t talk to me, won’t tell me what she is feeling.  She is going on with life, but keeping all her feelings inside.  Just like her note that time said, she doesn’t feel like talking about things to other people, so she may not say anything to her mom or sister.  I will probably find out, because the entire fam, including brother-in-law from Goldville, is descending on our house today for a lovely bbq get-together.  Maybe I will talk to my niece D., the 15-year-old alcoholic therapist.  We get each other pretty well.  No I haven’t stabbed myself yet, but I’m still thinking about it.  I have been awake since 8am, but just getting up and showered now.  I don’t really care.  I am the hideaway again, talking to the blog bcuz Anne won’t.  We lay next to each other for over an hour this morning, I gave her a backrub trying to be nice, but the deafening silence continued.    Maybe I’ve succeeded in driving her away, the wedge splitting the wood, the first crack making it all the way through.  Like hard old oak, if we are doomed to separate, it will not be a quick break but a tough job to break through all the knotted fiber and cellulose holding us.  I don’t want that to happen, but I am more afraid every day that it might.

      I am emotionally stunned, shocked, raw, bleeding all over. I am seriously thinking about how sharp the knives in the kitchen are, and how many little wounds I could cause without anyone noticing.  I am home again.  I have spent today basically avoiding as much contact as possible.  I called in “sick” to work (one can’t exactly call in “depressed”, can one?) and wrote several items on the laptop, including an excruciating description of last nights abortive runaway attempt.  I stayed in the hideaway until about 12:30, then went out.  Anne asked where I was going, I just said “I don’t know” and left.    As I was driving toward town, I figured I may as well accomplish something since I was off work and not in the mood for anything even remotely fun.  I got the oil changed in the car, then went to get a chronically repaired tire repaired for the 2nd time.  I then stopped at the mall to look at Borders’ books (on depression, my favorite topic!!), then the library, then Staples for a laptop mouse, then home.  As luck would have it, Anne and the kids were just heading out for shopping and errands, so I get another 2 hours of self-loathing in silence  The giants are playing ball tonight, maybe that will help.  On the other hand, maybe I will get shit-faced on scotch and drown in my own vomit.  At this point, I don’t fucking care.  I don’t have the will to fight or live or die or fix things or save a marriage or help kids or help myself.    Books:    Darkness Visible , William Styron, a self-written description of his depressional collapse at age 60    Unholy Ghost , a collection of essays from 23 authors describing their experiences with depression, their own or that of a loved one    How You Can Survive When You’re Depressed , Anne Sheffield, writing about her own experience being married to someone going through severe depression.

      It is very painful going out to the mall and seeing happy, content, confident people walk around, seemingly without a hint of concern about anything.  God, I want to be one of those people, I always have , but I never will be.  I am at once happy for them, jealous of them, and resentful toward their perfect little lives (despite the fact I actually know nothing about them and their own problems).  I actually was watching one young woman, probably no more than 22 or 23, too long, and she looked back at me.  After an instant, I quickly looked away, pretending to be very interested in a window display but actually being embarrassed.  She probably thought I was checking her out, when in reality I was just noticing how her confident walk and pleasant expression made her look painfully beautiful.  Looking back, I remember kids in high school who I thought were in the “in” crowd but in reality I think they were just as miserable as me, only they hid it better.  I am relatively certain one girl, Shannon, had as dismal an outlook on things as I did.  I was somewhat attracted to her, but we different circles of friends, so I rarely talked to her.  When we did talk, though, she was nice to me.  I remember her voice always had a brittle melancholy to it, except when she was socializing (or possibly putting on a façade) for her friends, the popular people.

      Nikki won a goldfish at the fair, so we bought a small aquarium.  Before it was setup, Goldie went belly-up.  Nikki had to bury it in the garden, so I’m sure will find the decomposed carcass sometime in the future.  Anyway, we decided to buy more interesting and less sensitive fish from the store.  We ended up with neon tetras, and other fish I don’t know the names of (or really care, so I make up names like See-thru and Red-eye), 7 total.  The fish food and equipment supplier had a brochure, titled something like Fintastic - Fish are Fun!  In it, there is a blurb about how in (use big announcer voice) Major University Studies, people with fish were found to be more relaxed and less tense than others.  So I sit, watching a group of creatures collectively smaller than a pickle, with roughly the same mental capacity, swim in endless circles around in a small cage with glass walls and fake plants.  They depend on people, creatures outside their universe of which they have no concept, for all food and care.  Meanwhile we sit and observe their movements, secure and confident in our mastery over the natural world.  Having been taken from their friends at the store, they endure a meaningless life of several months waiting for either death by bloating, or for a curious cat to pluck them from their watery tedium, swat them around while they suffocate, then eat them in a few crunchy bites.  Yeah, that makes me feel much more relaxed about things.  Doesn’t remind me of my own distorted concepts about life at all, does it?  Real important place in the universe there.  Rock on, little fishies, you inspire me.  Anne says it’s not like they were taken directly from the Amazon River, and even if they were, they just would have been eaten by bigger fish anyway, so why not enjoy them?  Why not, indeed. I think we should throw in a predator fish, watch the carnage, then cook his ass for dinner.

      I wake up this morning and feel defeated, lost, shamed, sad, guilty.  Guilty for hurting those around me and being such a failure as a person, a father, a husband.  I know this is the work of the inner demon, but I cannot stop it.  It would better for everyone if I ran away, I usually say, but it turns out I don’t even have the will to do that.  Unable to face work or family, I have banished myself to the hideaway over the garage, feeling like I’ve locked myself in a medieval tower for self-punishment.  I hope the kids do not find me here.  I can tell how stunned and shocked and hurt Anne is.  I guess I got her attention last night, eh?  Nice job, fucked-up loser. The greater the love and trust, the worse the shock is when one person suddenly snaps and acts in a way that is outside the other’s realm of possibilities.  I guess this is me trying to push her away, trying to get her to hate me as much as I hate myself.  If I keep working at it, She probably will not hate me, but just simply need to be apart from me for her own sanity and self-preservation.    It took longer, but I feel myself trying to do the same thing to her I have done to others.  The night I ran away from Becky in Reno, her silhouette staring at me from the window as I drove off to go rock-climbing at Donner at midnight.  The day I blew up at Angie for hiding my car keys in fun, and for the deal with Alyssa’s ATM card.  Other relationships with less intense feelings and correspondingly less elaborate sabotage.  My lack of connection with anyone in Mom’s family, despite their attempts to reach me after she died.  My lack of will to maintain any connection to Mom’s friends, or high school friends, or college friends, or former co-workers.  My habit of “wearing out my welcome” at each employer, where initially people seem to like me, then I become angry and bitter and distance myself from everyone.  This is what I do.  I get close to people, then I hurt them.  I push everyone away so they dislike me or ignore me.  I have tried and failed to maintain and uphold the value of Anne’s love and devotion to me.  I can’t place a high enough value on our marriage anymore, it’s not her fault at all.  I’m not worthy of her, I can’t stand the closeness, I just want to be alone for a while.

      I’m so fucked up, so crazy right now.  Everyone stay away from me.  I started to run away, I almost made it, and then I came back.  I was doing so good for a couple of days, too.  How fast things change.  More than anything else, I guess I just feel ashamed and stupid.  What do I think this is going to accomplish??  Pain suffering, heartache for everyone, not just me.  ------------------  Nikki was pushing me again.  Every bedtime I get so mad at her, because she will not listen and not just do things.  She has to screw around with animal noises, being slow, stalling, whining, complaining, refusing, ignoring.  Last night she did the same thing, but it went too far.  I was trying, pleading with her to just brush teeth and go to bed, so I could have a few minutes alone, so I could quietly rest.  I told her, “Please do this simple thing so no one gets mad, nobody cries, nobody gets in trouble.”  She would not do it and would not answer.  “Please don’t make me get angry at you, I don’t want to yell.”  Again, just looking at me, mot moving, not responding.  Getting impatient now, I say “Why are you doing this?  Do you want a problem, do you want yelling and crying, do you want me to be mad?”  She just looks at me, now with a twinge of defiance in her eye.    I am losing control inside, and I am ready to start breaking things.  I start repeating “Go do it, NOW”, louder each time, until I am yelling as loud as I can.  She looks away for a second, and I slam a book on the table inches from her, scaring her into motion.  She runs to the hallway outside the bathroom and kneels on all fours like another fucking animal impression, while I follow her to keep her moving.  Yelling again “GET UP NOW”, I nudge her with my foot.  Then I have the urge to kick her hard.  Mentally I feel myself swinging my foot forcefully into her ribs, feeling her small bones cracking against my foot, hearing her scream in a sudden mixture of shock, pain, and fear, kicking her again in the butt hard enough to break her hip bone and my foot at he same time...  I am blurring the line between reality and dark, hateful fantasy.  I have to stop, I have to control this mad urge.  I manage to force my foot to remain pinned on the floor, and I yell at her, “I am so mad right now I want to kick you and hurt you.”  She yelled something equally childish to me, then runs into her room.  [no, I did not do anything to physically harm her]  A minute later, she comes out in to the living room and says to me, “I hate you, I want you to die, I want to hurt you, I want to stick a sharp knife in your head,” then runs back to her room.  This hurts so bad, but I have to tell her something.  I follow her and get almost face to face, and very quietly say:  “There is nothing you can say to me or do to me that will hurt me worse than I hurt myself.  I want to hurt myself all the time.  I say bad things to myself ALL THE TIME, worse things than anything you can think of.  I want bad stuff to happen to me, and I think about it ALL THE TIME.  I hurt myself worse than anyone else ever can.”  This was too much for her, and she turns away and lays on the bed, crying quietly, then louder as I leave the room.  I am sitting, hating myself and the beast within me.  I think about stabbing myself repeatedly in the arms and hands with a knife or maybe an icepick.  I think about the pistol upstairs, grateful there is no ammunition in the house.  I think about taking a bat and destroying everything in the house until I cannot pick up my arms.  I briefly think about wanting to hurt my little girl, and I start crying.  Soon the sadness disappears, the tears dry, and there is nothing left but hate and loathing for myself, for the Old Bitch, for the Beast.  Anne comes home and immediately senses a problem.  “What’s going on?”   I say nothing for several minutes, a long, heavy, oppressive pause as I am mentally testing various explanations for my latest downward spiral.  Finally, I say “OK, do you really want to know?”, almost in a challenging tone.  “Should I?”, she asks.  “Yes, you should.”  “I had to struggle to keep from hurting my child tonight.  It was all I could do to keep from kicking the crap out of her, hard enough to break bones, hard enough to need to take her to the hospital.  That would have got your attention, huh?”  Thinking about further ramifications, I say “that would have got lots of people’s attention...  or, what if you were at home, you tried to stop me, and I take a swing at you instead?  Or, what about me wondering if taking half a bottle of antidepressants would give me a heart attack or a coma?  Or what about the urges I get to fling myself over the cliff driving on the highway just to find out what it is like to fly?  Or, what about the fact that it is a good thing there is no ammo in the house for the gun?  Or what about the urge to simply destroy everything we own, tv, windows, stuff, just break it all?  How about that I think you and the kids are better off without me, that I need to get away before I hurt someone else?”  I finally run out of words.  Through this outburst, I am not really looking at her, I don’t have to, but I glance over to confirm her shock and surprise at me.    “I’ll bet you’re sorry you asked, huh?”  I let that thought sit there as I go into the bathroom, leaving her in shock on the couch.  When I return, she has gone upstairs to cry on the bed.  I stood for a few minutes, debating what to do.  Finally, without really thinking and without saying a word, I grab my keys and wallet and rush out the door with a slam, get in the car, and drive off before Anne can react and try to stop me.  Well, now what, I think as I start driving toward the highway.  I am filled with a hundred conflicting destinations, thoughts rational and otherwise, and an overbearing self-ridicule.  A part of me is trying to be detached and logical about it, but I’m not listening: “Where the hell are you going to go?  What will you do when you get there?  Won’t it be worse every mile you go?  What about tomorrow?  What about the next day?  Doesn’t it get harder every day you don’t return? You are being irrational, melodramatic, impulsive, out of control.”  I am just driving, through town, aimlessly north on the freeway, the lines leading me onward, 20 miles without even changing lanes, oblivious to the few cars on the road.  This road goes for 500 miles, I was thinking, without having to turn off.  There is a sense of escape conflicting with the guilt I feel with every mile.  As I pass Trinidad, the last lights I will see for a while, I get a sense that I am have reached a decision point, a threshold between a do-over and for-real.  As the last lights fade, the logical part of me checks the gas gauge out of habit and experience... and the rest of me grudgingly accepts that I can’t run anywhere without more gas.  I flip a u-turn across the divide and go back to Trinidad.  While getting gas, I go inside the mini mart for coffee.  The guy says “have a good night, man.”  Yeah, it has started off so well this far, I think, driving away... but I don’t get back on the freeway as I intended, instead continuing on the old road parallel to the freeway, leading south, toward home.  I am driving somewhat aimlessly, but I realize at his point that I cannot run any further away.  I make my way back to town indirectly on side roads, passing our old house where Dan was a baby 11 years ago, passing the street to Anne’s parents’ house, passing my office, then turning around and sitting in the office parking lot for a few minutes.  I’m aware that my presence in this neighborhood well past midnight might attract police attention, which I don’t want right now, so I park in the shadows and turn off the lights.  Then I pick up my phone, 2 hours after running away.  Anne answers on the second ring.  “I’m sorry I am such an idiot, such a fucking failure to you”, I said.  “I was waiting to get a call from the hospital or the police”, she says without accusing, but it still hurts me.  “I don’t want to kill myself, that’s too easy ... I just want to hurt and punish myself.”  Pause.  “I’m sorry I can’t control this or handle this mess any better.  I guess I’m being childish, running away.”  Longer pause.  “Do you want me to come home?”  “Yes,” she says, and starts crying.    So I head home, through the fog, the grey blanket shrouding everything and everyone, most of all my heart.  I think about trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together, and I wonder if we have been irreparably damaged, despite my return.  I return to a dark house, and go upstairs where she is waiting awake in bed.  I undress and get in without either of us saying a word and without touching each other.  After a few minutes, she finally turns toward me, and we hold each other, somewhat guardedly at first, not quite a full embrace, more from relief than anything else, no hint of passion.  I feel the sadness and the hurt coming from her (can she feel mine?), but I can’t say or do anything.  Finally we simply let each other go, and it took about an hour to fall asleep.

      Sign in therapist’s waiting room, no receptionist:  “Please sit down - Someone Will be With You Shortly”  That is an open-ended statement, right?  If you are in a therapist’s office, it takes a great leap of faith to simply wait.  There are lots of possible negative outcomes here.  What if no one ever comes??  Maybe they evacuated, maybe they all fainted from carbon monoxide, maybe they all died of the superflu, maybe there is someone holding them at gunpoint, maybe they just don’t want to help YOU.  Maybe they will all come and tell you how messed up you really are, forget the touchy-feely crap, we have a special jacket for you, come see these men in white coats...  Maybe someone looking for you just left, and now you have missed your appointment and will be billed, but in reality you were there waiting the whole time, inventing horrifying possibilities why no one ever came to help you.  Something for me to think about in the waiting room.

      Back in May, before I started the blog, I was sent to a training course in Las Vegas for my "new" official position as CAD Manager  (in which I settle personality disputes and review the performance of drafters, and decide on filing and appearance standards for our drafting output - neither of which I have been doing well lately, but SO not the point now) . I had been in a severe funk in the months preceeding the Vegas trip, so I had decided to drive there and back. Driving is always theraputic for me  (I will get into that another time) , the scenery is beautiful, and I had not been that way for 15 years. I was going to swing by to see my friend in Santa Barbara, but that didn't happen for multiple reasons  (also a future topic) .      It is apx. 1000 miles from Eureka to Vegas, depending on which route you drive. I, of course, chose scenic over direct. I went to Sacramento first, then up US 50 to Tahoe. It was lightly snowing that morning (in May!), and everything was beautiful. South from Tahoe to Monitor Pass (I climbed a small hill, about 150 feet of rocks), then south on 395 to Mono Lake and Mammoth Lakes area. The next day, I went through the Bristlecone Pine forest in the White Mountains (should be a Nat. Park), then through the desert to US 95, straight to Vegas. On the way home, I drove straight through from Vegas to home, about 21 hours. I went through Death Valley (almost 90° at 9am) and Yosemite National Parks (spring melt along the just-opened Tioga Pass road), then directly home. 2000 miles round trip.    I grew up in the Sierra Nevada, and it always brings back so many memories, mostly good ones about exploring the woods and the mountains, pine trees, camping, and granite. I am not so much a hard-core backpacking hiker (although I've done it a few times) as a low-stress, drive-and-day-hike hiker. I like places where I can drive to a trailhead and walk no more than 1-2 hours to get to. I may miss some spectacular scenery, but I have seen a lot of neat stuff in my explorations. I actually think some "Wilderness Areas" are somewhat overrated, although I love the concept of wilderness as much as actually visiting one. Anyway, digressing.    I think the trip was in general the most uplifting and healing time of my life. Right when I really needed it, I got the opportunity to be alone in the landscape I love so much, to take some beautiful pictures to look at later, but more than anything to just let the pressures and demands and negativity just slip away like peeling layers from an onion. When you get to my core, when I am exploring in nature, I am like a kid, seeing everything, feeling the beauty in the landscape and in the forest that honestly I think many people can never feel. I cannot describe how happy and content I felt just being part of the world, returning in a sense to "my" mountains but in another sense returning to the innocent wonder of childhood. Remember catching frogs or crawdads because it was fun, or taking a walk just to see what was there, or stopping to get out of the car because you saw something stunningly beautiful? At those times it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks or says, you are simply enjoying life in that moment.    I was like an early naturalist, exploring the landscape, learning about the ecology and geology and natural history and climate of everything and everywhere I found. I was exploring everything - forests, valleys, plants, small furry creatures, large outcrops of basalt and tuff and obsidian, volcanic craters and peaks, joshua trees, lizards surviving at 10,000 feet, 4,000-year-old trees, earthquake faults, tufa deposits, glacier-carved canyons, alluvial fans, rain shadows, playa lakes, microclimates, glacial erratics. I was so unafraid and content and free, I actually found it safe to let myself talk to people - me, the anti-socialite, having light conversations with people in restaurants or campgrounds and markets. I shot about an hour of video and took about 250 pictures during the trip.  (I LOVE my digital camera, I can snap away and delete later, without worring about "dumb" pictures of stuff I found neat at the time, but later cannot figure out what I saw.)     Then, I hit Las Vegas. I guess it is a real big city now, suburbs extending for miles. I almost had a little anxiety episode when reaching town. After the beauty and solitude of the natural world, being thrust back into the world (in The City of Evil, of all places) was quite a shock to me. That feeling passed soon, but it was interesting to me how shocking that was for me, letting me know that I was totally immersed in the escape mode of my trip. I walked the Strip, looked in a few places, but really returned to feeling alone, detatched, invisible while I was there. Vegas is a difficult town to be alone in, I think. I could have done stuff with other people attending the class, but I didn't feel comfortable, I just wanted to be alone, even though paradoxically I would have liked to be confident enough to be sociable without feeling nervous. But then I won $250 on a quarters machine, so I got happy again.

      This is the new blog location for silly things that I find funny. I didn't ask if anyone else thought they were funny. Besides, this blog for depressing and morose brooding, not silliness.   I am just getting started with the funny stuff.  For example, why do they call it "Ovaltine"?   Anyway, the site is:  urlLink Mildly Ironic or Amusing Stuff

       I have a fantasy about writing an episode of CSI, or maybe just a short story, about the homicide of John Elway. He is visiting in Vegas and is murdered in his hotel room. The weird part is that his head is severed and replaced with the severed head of a donkey. Meanwhile, the donkey with Elway's head is recovered from the bathroom near the sports book at the New Frontier. The donkey is just fine, and was chacking out the horse racing on the TV wall. Of course, police recognised Elway's body in the hotel room immediately, because of the facial resemblance to a donkey, and it took several hours before anyone realized the head in the hotel room actually belonged to the donkey downstairs, who by now is in a room with a couple of prostitutes, saying "I'm a Stallion!" over and over. Anyway, it turns out the crime was committed by a crazed Raiders fan, who is sitting in Gilley's watching midnight bikini bull riding.    BTW, I'm hope Elway's arena football team gets their ASSES beat by Bon Jovi's AFL team.  Bon Jovi is cool.

      A correction regarding my earlier statement about gas prices.  According to  urlLink an article  in GeoTimes, the magazine of the American Geological Institute:    "...analysts point out that while gas prices are higher than ever before, when adjusted for inflation, the true price of gasoline at the pump has fallen more than 40 percent from its peak of $2.77 per gallon in 1981."    OK, but it's still cheaper in Oregon.

      Work? What's that? I think I have done about 2 hours worth of actual productive work in the 12 working hours since returning from vacation. I actually left the office and am sitting in the local library so I can write blog stuff without feeling guilty. OK, so the 90 minute lunch is not good for my employment status, but fukkit. Maybe I subconsciously want to get myself fired. That would shake things up a little, eh?    I have a decided lack of creativity in my culinary repertoire. The last several times I have drove through McDonalds for lunch, I have ordered the exact same thing - 2 McTastes-Like-Chicken, a Fruit &amp; Yogurt, and the extra-large diet coke for $3.85 (again, my body is a temple - for devil worship) . Today, I thought I would do something different, so I left off the Fruit&amp;Yogurt and paid only $2.78. Not only am I gastronomically challenged, I am pathologically cheap.    I had a spectacular poem I wrote from a dream, about crashiing into the ocean in my van. It was honestly one of the best things I have ever written. I am so pissed. I hope I find it.    I hate leafblowers. They symbolize everything that is wrong with Americans. They are loud, noisy, give off noxious gas, and they push one person's problems (leaves and dirt) onto someone else (my front yard) with little to no effort. Even worse ar those people who think they are too good to pick up their own fkn leafblower and instead hire illegal immigrants for $3/hr. How dirty would LA be without them??    Gas is too damn expensive. Behind the redwood curtain, it is 2.39 for unleaded. In Brookings, Oregon, it is 2.19, just as isolated, and they pump for you. At the Tolowa reservation in Smith River, it was 2.07 - no fed or state taxes for the tribe.     California sucks, I want out. Maybe I am a girlie-man democrat that has suddenly realized it is not so cool to have far-right-wing-Terminator as the governator.

      I'm not sure I know how to deal with the death of Q., co-worker and all-around good person.  She was basically the exact opposite of me in every way.  Maybe it is the depression talking, but I feel like I have already done my mourning.  After all, about 4 months ago, I passed by her (empty) desk and had a little mental flash that said "she will never sit at this desk again".  As far as I know she was right, but I don't think it took any clairvoyance on my part to figure that out - she has been sick for over a year.  I have been sad for her a few times, and felt like I should do something more for her, and somewhat guilty for not really doing anything.  I was not really that close to her, though.  Am I a heartless bastard for not crynig with everyone else yesterday, or visiting the group grief session at lunch, or not going to the service??  There is a small service Sunday, but I think I will not go.  I am sad (but not grief-stricken), but I just don't feel like it is my place to go just for the sake of showing my face.  That would be somewhat insincere of me, I think.  Maybe I will send my poem from yesterday.

      Later last night when Anne and Dan came home, I was just mentally drifting when she grabbed me and said hello with a nice kiss. The kids were busy with a movie, so we sneaked upstairs laid on the bed, just cuddling and talking. One thing led to another, and we were soon both crying in an emotional mess. Well, I guess that was mostly me. The conversation went something like this:    R=I don't know how you can love me, I feel so not worthy, I feel like I let you down all the time.  A=I love you anyway  R=I have a hard time loving you in return because of the depression.  I think you would be happier without me.  A=I love you very much, I need you.  R=Sometimes when the "depressed-me" is in charge, I think about leaving for a long time.  A=[silence]  R=When "I" am in control, I know I could never leave you, but "I" am not in control most of the time. The "depressed-me" is in control often, and he wants to push everyone away and be miserable, run away from everyone, including you.  A=[still silent]  R=I know you love me, but I can't return that love very well. When the "depressed-me" is in control, I don't feel love for anybody, I don't want anyone to love me.   A=[still silent}  R=I can feel so alone, whether by choice or not, with you, with friends, with family, at work... at those moments I really need someone to ...  A=pay more attention?  R=yes, and pull me back into the moment and let me know that I'm okay, that you care even if I am being a jerk. I feel so damaged, so incomplete as a partner, a companion, a husband...  A=[silence]  R=and the other part of me just wants to ignore everyone and be left alone in the grey zone.  A=I need to be alone sometimes too.  R=for weeks or months? for several days in a row? enough to make you question everything you have ever done end every relationship you have?  A=No.  R=I know you love me, and I love you very much, even though I don't show it very well. I'm sorry I am so messed up, I'm sorry I am causing you so much stress over this.  A=I do love you, very much  R=I don't know how to make you understand how I can be happy and so sad at the same time.  A=[silence]    Well,  at least this is different than feeling nothing, right?      added 2:50 pm:      Later, she made a joke:    R=What are you thinking, about how to get rid of me and hide the body so you can collect the insurance?  A=No, I already know how to do that...    We will be OK, I'm pretty sure.  It's not her, it's me.

      Last night I was alone with Nikki for a few hours, and we ended up playing the game of Life. Funny, I don't recall seeing a space that says "You are hopelessly depressed - quit the game and pay $10,000 for your funeral" or "Insurance benefit exceeded - pay therapist $5,000". Nikki is so ... Nikki. She wants to play the game, she wants to be the banker but wants no help doing the math, she never wants dinner at dinnertime, but she wants to eat a banana while playing. She tells me that "it's nutritious, and I don't want dinner, and I will be happy, so let me have it". How can I argue with that? It then takes about 45 minutes to do the next 3 turns, because of bathroom breaks, discussing the new fish, playing camel with me, the spinner breaks, and so on. Oh yeah, also the ongoing and expanding stable of animal impressions she performs on a near-constant basis - dog, cat, horse, raccoon, tuna(!), elephant seal, otter, etc. I am really trying to be patient through this, because really she is just being Nikki. Last night I survuved it, some times I don't. I want to, for her sake, because for some unknown reason she really enjoys doing things with me, when SHE wants to.     Instead of being the typical dad who threatens the boyfriend, I will give him a $50 and say "Good luck kid, you are definitely going to need a therapist after dating my daughter".

      We have lost our friend Q. to cancer today. Instead of being sad or bitter about how unfair this is, I will choose to remember the way she touched me personally.    If there was ever anyone who could fight and win, we knew it was you. Your inner strength, your upbeat personality, your will to live on your terms, affected everyone who knew you. Even during the fight of your life, you chose to put others first, whether sharing your laugh or smile, helping others feel better, or just keeping us fed. In the face of unimaginable odds, your strength and grace was an inspiration to us all.    Your body has lost this battle, but your soul has won it's freedom. You are free once more to laugh, love, play with cats, and give inspiration to everyone who ever knew you. Long after the tears have dried, the bills are paid, and the candy dish emptied, your love and light will live on in our hearts and memories forever, and we are all better for having you in our lives.

       Well, back at work, not really interested in being here, what else is new??  Well, here is a summary of the week vacation:      We went camping in Oregon - the 4 of us, plus Anne's sister M. and fam, plus her parents and their 3 foster kids - 17 people total. It was pretty relaxing, even with all the kids, just because this is the first trip where I have made an effort not to act like a jerk; I took some alone time, thought before speaking, and focused on enjoying the good parts of the trip. We went on a  urlLink dune buggy tour , the kids got to play in the lakes, the adults got to relax a little, and we got ice cream on the way home.           In addition, it was interesting from the standpoint that my niece and I ended up having some informal therapy sessions together. She's 15, she was abused as a little one, then went into foster care with (and later adopted by) M. Anyway, she has addictions (alcohol), OCD, depression, and trust/intimacy issues, and is on the same medicine as me. It turns out that we are very similar in the way our problems have expressed themselves on the surface. She and I talked quite a bit during the campout, and I think it was helpful for both of us. I think she feels like there is someone in the family that can understand what she is going through, and that I will listen if she needs someone outside her home to talk to. I also talked to M., mostly about my experience and helping her understand what the girl is going through.          Maybe I have found something worthwhile to do for my next career.          Anyway, we were lazy this weekend, recovering from the camping trip. I did not have any computer time this past week. although I wrote a lot of stuff using ancient tools called " pen " and " paper ". Apparently these tools for recording written information were popular for many centuries before becoming almost obsolete in the last decade. I will share some of these when I get them typed up.          More later.

         Dammit, Nikki pushes me so much sometimes.    I really try to be fair, understanding, not react with anger.    I realize she is being herself, but it is still very frustrating.    She often refuses to accept my authority, or her role in the parent-child relationship.    How can I earn her respect without resorting to intimidation, emotional abuse, etc?    How can I avoid using the so-called parenting skills I learned as a kid?    She’s smart; maybe just talking to her about it will help.    Unfortunately, that does not get the teeth brushed any easier or help her remember to not make a mess with food upstairs.  It is worst when I am in enveloped in depression, although it is still a problem with me during the "good" periods.

         I really hope my recent dreams are not a predictor of future events.    I am smart enough to know I am not psychic, but then again I have had a few times in my life where I had a little feeling, a subconscious nudge, and I listened.    Then, I project this into thinking I should be psychic all the time, and feel guilty when I cannot protect someone.       I’m not obsessing or anything, but I have only thought about this 25 times today.    I know there is little reason to worry, just drive carefully tomorrow, pay attention, stay safe.

         I have not had the experience of watching my parents get old, like most everyone else.    I never had a dad, and my mom died 13 years ago at age 56.    Anne’s parents are turning into old people, sometimes funny old people, but definitely not healthy old people.    I have the bad feeling that there will be some sad times ahead for Anne as her family gets older.    Her grandma is 83 and in relatively good shape after losing Grandpa 18 months ago;    her dad is 60, and essentially subsists on crackers, ice cream, and coffee; her mom is 57, overweight, high blood pressure, and sometimes looks very ill (although none will admit it, being from stubborn, hardy stock Midwest families); her aunt and uncle appear healthy but at ages 54 and 63 (I’m guessing there) have their own problems.    Our brother-in-law, who is on dialysis and needs a transplant, could turn serious very quickly.    I’m afraid that in the next 5 to 10 years there will be lots of health problems and possibly deaths in her family.       How will this affect me?    Since I really have no family, these people are my extended family as well.    I have no one to care for as they age, so I will do whatever I can for her parents.    I will need to be strong for Anne, because it will hit her very hard.    I know I can be strong and support her, but at the same time it will hurt me also.           I realize this is a depressive thought train, worrying about and anticipating sad events before they even happen.    Hopefully I can avoid dwelling on this idea.

         I had another weird dream, this on the day before driving to   Florence ,  Oregon   for our camping trip.    Dan and I were riding in my Mom’s old 1971 WV Bug, the 7-toned yellow one.    We were driving on the coast on an old, tiny, narrow road with very sharp corners, so sharp the Bug could not stay on the road.    The road turns a very sharp corner, and I calmly realize there is no way.    Dan (who is slightly older, perhaps 13) says “uh, DAD, LOOK OUT!!”, but too late as the wheels are already over the edge, driver’s side first, starting to nose down into the cove.       Falling - we are about 50 feet above the clear blue water, waves gently breaking on the rocky shore.    Time has stretched out in that dreamy way, giving us plenty of time to shift our weight backward and bring up the nose so the car is nearly flat by the time it hits the water.    There is time to look at the beautiful section of coast, the birds, the clouds, the slowly approaching water, as we fall.    As we are about 10 feet from the water, I am thinking, “VWs can float for a minute or two, so we will have time to –”       Suddenly time accelerates to about 125%, freaky fast, not quite fast forward.    The car immediately fills with water as we plunge below the surface, drifting quickly downward.    There is no time for either of us to breathe, or to warn Dan.    He is struggling to unlatch the (stupid VW) seatbelt, open the door, roll the window down, do something to escape, but he is running out of time.    In the meantime, I sit and do nothing, watching him without helping, while I idly fiddle with the rounded, black door-lock lever.    My lungs are imploding, but I don’t feel it or care.    Just before I breathe in the water, just before we both drown, I go black ... and wake up.

      Well, I will be on vacation the next week, camping in the coastal wilds of Oregon, so likely no opportunity to be on the net at all.  Wow, a week without computers - how will I function?  Just fine, actually.  If I can get some quiet time with the sitka spruce, wax myrtle, red huckleberry, salal, pitcher plant, hawks, osprey, and whatever flora and fauna I can find, I will be relaxed and peaceful.  Nothing helps my state of mind more than the forest, except maybe for forests in the mountains.  Beaches are ok, but not the same.    Listening to:  Weezer, first album (including "Buddy Holly")  I think my mood is lifting somewhat.  "Supplementing" my normal dosage of anti-depressants helps a bit, but so does just keeping my mind occupied with thoughts that are not self-destructive.  I wonder if I (and others like me) actually get addicted to depression.  In the same was as alcolholics, I don't know what to do if I haven't had my negative thoughts for the day.  I can't be happy for an extended period with falling off the emotional wagon.  If I accept that chemistry is more to blame than anything else, I am at the mercy of an imperfect body.  If I choose to believe my problems are entirely psychological, then why can't I escape the grey moods I get into?  I guess the reality is that it is both mental and physical, and I need to deal with both aspects separately, but in a coordinated effort.  Honestly, I prefer anger to the bleak grey moods that hold me captive.  Anger makes the body active, alive, gives me a purpose.  The grey fog just sucks every bit of energy and motive and caring away from me, and I just want to do nothing but sleep and wallow in self-pity.  Well, clean up loose ends at work, set out the backup tapes for someone to run, finish locating details for the casino development plans, and get out of here without offending anyone or running away.  Sure, I can do that.  Bye for a week, blogger friends (anne, kim, and others).

      I'll live, don't worry.  The depression is talking to me, the many voices in my head.  Maybe I need a higher dosage, maybe I need a new therapist, maybe I need a break from therapy.  I know I always feel worse before I feel better, after a session.  Often the discussions in therapy send me on a  dark spiral that I eventually get over, but not without some trying times first.  Bye for now.

      So I was sitting in my car, contemplating the sorry-ass mood I have been in, reading my cognitive therapy books, thinking I have reached the bottom of my current grey mood.  I am trying to listen to the Inner Critic, hearing the constant litany of crap channeled through my conscious thoughts...  Then suddenly a  very large BOOM  shook the ground, the air, my car!  In a town of 30,000, you hear loud noises occasionally, but this was very large, like a bomb or an explosion.  I drove in a loop around downtown, but no one seemed very concerned, no sirens, police cruising sedately down Broadway, and so on.  When I got back to the office, several people heard it and felt it.  I was over a mile from the office, so it must have been something large.  Maybe we are under attack.  Maybe Al-queda needs redwood trees for something so they are here to kick our ass.  Oh well, as long as the terrorists don't ask me how I am feeling today.  The next person that asks me "how ya doin?" will get punished, I'm quite sure.

      I am going through a particularly rough stretch of depression right now. My logical side knows this, is trying to process this, but cannot do anything about it.  I feel so empty inside.  Someone push me in front of a bus now, and be done with it.  This entry is from last night and this morning, just a stream of consciousness at the time I wrote it.  7/7/2004 6:09 PM I don’t often really feel honest emotions, good or bad.  I act happy or sad or mad sometimes, but when the moment is over, I am surrounded by the grey.  It’s not a losing or winning, not an up or down.  Just a flatline, a cold, emotionless zombie, a shell, not really alive, undead.  I have a difficult time feeling emotionally close to anyone.  I love Anne, but I am afraid we are not close anymore.  It is hard to feel loved and at the same time have her be emotionally distant and silent.  Dan has grown up to be as moody and brooding and angry as me, with occasional violent outbursts and frequent periods of self-isolation, because that’s what I taught him for 10 years.  Nikki has learned the anger also, but she expresses it much differently.  My best friend lives 500 miles away and I never get to see her, Anne is jealous of our relationship, and she would not “let me” go see her on the recent road trip.  It is impossible for me to feel close to anyone I work with now or previously, or anyone from college or high school.  I don’t enjoy things that should be fun for me.  I could have enjoyed fireworks, the beach, playing music, going to dinner, having a night alone with Anne, playing a game, or whatever.  I either did not enjoy it at all, or I maybe just was slightly pleased, but after the task or activity was done, it is back to normal life, with no real enjoyment or satisfaction at all.  I feel bad about procrastinating and letting things stay in disarray, but not bad enough to anything about it.  The retirement fund is in a low-paying investment – I don’t care.  The car needs a tire replaced – oh well, fix it later.  Taxes need to be done – who cares, I have lots of time.  The upstairs is a mess – whatever, if it is not urgent, screw it.  Stuff to do in the yard, oh well, it can wait.    I have become so indecisive and passive that I just don’t care or take any satisfaction in accomplishing things, and I just take the easy way out of any problem.  We bought our house, fine, now we move our shit, but nothing really changes.  A co-worker wants to start a company, but it is easier to stay at my job and bitch about my career.  Anne and I don’t communicate very well and I still feel very distant from her sometimes, but it is easier to say nothing and not cause trouble.  I don’t really look forward to anything right now.  I have nothing to accomplish in my current career or job that will mean anything or give me any satisfaction at all.  I get a paycheck, nothing more.  I don’t enjoy work, I don’t care about work, I don’t care if things get accomplished or not, I don’t care if the company lives or dies or stays the same.  Nothing I do there makes much difference, I don’t really care about any of the people there, and I could be (and maybe should be) replaced at any time  I don’t feel like I will ever be a happy person.  I will survive being cold, distant, scared of people, isolating myself, and sinking into a grey blanketing fog, drowning in mist but not enough to die.  The best I can do is try not to hurt anyone on the way into hell.    7/7/2004 6:43 PM  I feel love for Anne, but it is more of a family or companionship love than a lover’s love.  Last night in bed, Anne was letting me know she wanted me.  I had to talk myself into having sex, because even holding her, I realized it didn’t matter one way or another.  On the nights when she is home in the evening to talk to, she usually would rather watch something on TV (I’m starting to hate television).  She has been loving and comforting and caring and passionate, but those times are very rare.  Usually I feel like our relationship is distant, silent, convenient, more like roommates than lovers.    I think I would feel different if Anne opened up to me a little more and let me know what she is thinking or feeling.  I have asked several times over the past 6 months for feedback, a reaction, her thoughts or feelings about my depression and how it affects her and us.  She will tell me almost nothing.  I believe she loves me, but I think I would feel much more positive about our relationship if we could talk more about what has happened to our relationship, our feelings, our love, and how we have changed since we met.  Instead we talk about inane, small stuff like daycare, TV, Oprah, daycare kids, foster kids, more about daycare, my job, or mindless trivial things.   7/7/2004 7:39 PM  I don’t care about going camping this next week.  It will be nice to get away from work, but I have very little desire to spend several days camping with the rest of the family, and screaming kids.  Anne’s sister has adopted kids, and her mother has foster kids, so there will be 7 kids younger than 8 years old (not counting Nikki and Dan).  It will be excruciating for me to listen to the constant whining and crying and yelling.  I love camping where I can just sit and be peaceful with nature.  As usual, this will not be that kind of camping trip.  7/8/2004 8:04 AM  It’s the depression talking.  I need Anne, I need my family, I love them very much - I know this is true.  But at the same time, the grey blanket won’t let me feel any lasting emotion, happy, sad, contentment, hurt.  I will feel better for a few minutes, but the depression pulls me back in like gravity, like a magnetic field, inescapable, smothering, drowning.  The wet, cold, grey blanket smothers out any spark or flame of ambition, dreams, feelings, positives or negatives  I don’t want to talk or interact with anybody.  I am antisocial.  When I don’t like people, it is the depression talking.  It takes a tremendous amount of effort to not snap at everyone.  I try to not look like I feel, because then people will ask if I am OK, or what is wrong.  They don’t really want to know, they are just being polite and (social)?  If I really tell them, it is too much information.  Nobody likes a gloomy sad sack, nobody likes Eeyore, people want everyone to be happy and shiny and Feeling Good.  It’s not safe to tell the truth, so I keep it inside as much as possible, say nothing to anyone,   I want it dark, hoping I can remain in the grey zone and avoid the light.  The sun burns, sears, makes everything too bright and colorful.  The fog is the depression - it is comforting in a perverse way.    I don’t care or don’t want to do anything, just sit in the grey zone and be fucked up, be miserable, be invisible.  I do nothing, it does nothing, we all do nothing, the world just stops for a while when you are in the fog.  I think I could just sit and do nothing for days, weeks, months, just not care about anything, not give a shit whether the world exists or not.  I almost wish a disaster would happen, either that or win the lottery.  Either way, my life would either be over, be more interesting, or be free from my current life.  Disaster, lottery, who cares - at least it is something different than the fog.

      Like most of my creative writing, this story is part true and part imagined.  There really were two cats staring at each other, one all black and one all white.  In this case the imagined part came at 2:30 am on a recent sleepless night.  At the time it was magical, but when I started writing it was hard to make the symbolism work coherently.  The words didn't flow, they more correctly fell out onto the page with a thud and much breakage.  After several messy drafts and discarding spurious metaphors, here it is.  This is certainly not my best writing, but this is as good as it will get right now.  Maybe I will revisit this in 5 years when I get my first anthology published. ;-)     Opposite Cats  it was a grey morning, a foggy day, the sky and the concrete, both sullen grey. a grey tabby watches, mildly curious  as two cats stare at each other  a black cat on the fence, a white cat under the car  a human would find it bizarre, I think, opposing cats staring from afar,  waiting for the other to blink... like gunslingers before high noon.  time freezes, the world stops, tension created. issues of feline importance are debated  telepathically, as the temperature drops.   fight or flight left or right hiss or growl sleep or prowl  kill a bird, or a mouse in, or out of the house be lovable, or aloof climb a tree, or scale the roof  guard the yard, or stay on the fence run, or engage in homeland defence sleep all day, carouse all night   two cats staring, one black, one white.  the moment passes, the fog melts away the two cats decide to gracefully back down they'll settle their differences another day,  there's more important things to be done, like cleaning and chasing and eating food and sleeping all day, if one's in the mood.  the grey tabby lingers, watching, content to be in between two extremes, and then indifferently turns away.

      We had a case of the mangled manual on The Siblings Court the other day.  Dan claimed he saw Nikki and her friend ripping the manual to his Nintendo game, and that they ripped it again after he caught them.  Nikki's defense was that it was "an accident".  We set up a court, and I was the judge.  I made them take turns speaking just like in court, except I did the questioning.  Dan objected, and Nikki thought objecting meant he could lie.  The evidence showed that the the first rip may have been an accident, but the next 3 rips were not.  Anyway, Nikki was found guilty, and sentenced after she offered her apology (and attempted to bribe me with $50).  They both decided it was fair, even though Nikki was not really sorry about it.  They both had fun, it was fair, and it was a different way to solve a problem, in ... the Sibling's Court.

      Here is my "When I ..." list, borrowed from  urlLink Abby  for your enjoyment.  If you answer honestly, it is somewhat thought-provoking.  Feel free to copy and do your own, but leave a link in the comments.   When it rains, I:	sit by the window, watching and listening, or go driving, or take a walk When it's sunny, I:	pull the curtains and hide from the light When it's windy, I:	get bad allergies, then headaches When it's snowy, I:	am amazed at the playful snowflakes, and awed by the beauty of  perfect, untouched snow on the ground When it's stormy, I:	want it to continue for days, and go watch the ocean crashing on the rocks When it’s foggy, I:	want to be surrounded by it, and am glad that it makes everyone else irritable When I'm happy, I:	try to accept it, even though it makes me uncomfortable When I'm sad, I:	am not surprised, have no hope, have no energy, have nothing to say When I'm scared, I:	feel defeated and want to hide When I'm lonely, I:	want company, but cannot bring myself to reach out to others, so I bear the loneliness as if it were something to be proud of When I'm horny, I:	stay behind my desk so I don’t distract my co-workers. When I'm in love, I:	feel happy to be loved, but scared it might tragically end When I'm angry, I:	destroy stuff, hurt feelings, feel guilty later When I'm hating, I:	get real quiet, bottle up the anger, then blow up and lash out at everyone else within sight When I'm hurting, I:	feel wounded and raw and bleeding, and want to (1) hide to either die or recover, or (2) hold on to someone who loves me When I'm thinking, I:	am at my best When I'm sleeping, I:	am sound asleep, unless an earthquake happens When I'm cold, I:	love to bundle up in layers of clothes and blankets When I'm hot, I:	look for shade, or rest in a cool place When it's night, I:	walk or drive around, wondering about the stories behind each window When it's day, I:	work, or feel guilty about not working When it's morning, I:	wish I could sleep another 4 hours When it's evening, I:	am exhausted from having to play nice all day When it's summer, I:	wish it was winter When it's autumn, I:	like to see everything dying and preparing for a long winter nap When it's winter, I:	wish there was less rain and fog here, and more snow and ice When it's spring, I:	enjoy the last few days until the allergies get real bad When I'm drunk, I:	get even more introspective and quiet than normal (then just fall asleep) When I'm stoned, I:	sorry, no drugs, my body is a temple (just shitloads of junk food) When I win, I:	win with class, and feel like I deserved it  When I lose, I:	lose with dignity, feel like I deserved it, and get mad enough to try again. When I look in the mirror, I:	try not to dwell on the imperfections When I watch TV, I:	like sports, nature, science, and old 70’s-80’s game shows When I watch movies, I:	like to escape reality, try not to be critical of poor performances, and remember that Matt Damon is much better than Ben Affleck When I listen to music, I:	like to lose myself in the moment, feel the chords and the rhythm as if I were playing myself. When I watch baseball, I:	miss not having a Dad to play ball with, and wish I could have seen the old players from the 30’s through the 50’s. When I read, I:	learn something new every time I pick up a book When I'm tired, I:	want to sleep like a polar bear When I'm wide awake, I:	have to be thinking or occupying my brain with some mental task When I'm fighting, I:	know I am right, even if I question myself later When I'm arguing, I:	don’t understand how the other person can’t see that I am right When I'm feeling clever, I:	have just repaired something or written something I am proud of When I'm feeling stupid, I:	have just finished another day at the office, or just been talking to my daughter When I’m writing, I:	have a lot to say, some boring, some stupid, some insightful and witty, all of it serious and heavy, and mean every word of it When I sing, I:	sing the harmony parts, instrumental parts, bass line, or the drums, but usually not the melody When I dance, I:	look like an idiot, hence the dance moratorium of 1989 When I drink, I:	love a huge cup with a mixture of diet coke, mr pibb, cherry coke, and dr pepper, but only from the fountain, no cans or bottles When I eat, I:	eat too much, enjoy myself, think of my Mom When I look back, I:	wish I had not been scared to be myself all the time, and wish I treated a few people with a little more respect and kindness. When the world ends, I:	won’t be here to care

      We went to Applebees last night for dinner.  The only reason I went is because I got a gift cert for helping someone move.  Our waitress had that shifty, abnormally high energy, frenetic twitching, can't remember my name, methamphetamine vibe.  Anne and I, being from Goldville, immediately recognize the druggie shuffle after years of seeing people affected by meth.  She forgot to enter our order, messed up our order, forgot to bring drinks, and had to be bailed out by the other waitresses.  She was not rude or mean or anything, just in withdrawl jitterbug mode.  I half expected her to start climbing the walls or throwing things at random, but she barely remained control.  As we drove away, she was outside the back door smoking as fast as possible.  Fucking drugs.  Yes she chose to do drugs, but anyone can make a mistake.  Once you are hooked, you are fucked.

He said "Where is this Holland or something?  Yodel-ay-hee-hoo, they are in some rugged country."  Okay, Holland more like ____, maybe Switzerland more like /\/\~/\/\.

      Bad things happen all the time to people of all ethnic and economic backgrounds, but the only time the media gets really interested is if the victims or their families are rich and white.  The Media force-feeds us tragedies of rich white people across the country as if the problems of the elite in their gated communities somehow relate to the rest of us who live or work or die in an imperfect, unmanicured, chaotic world.  In the past year, the TV networks have tripped over themselves and each other to see who could most dramatically portray the terrible stories of the upper crust: the kidnapping of a girl from a rich Mormon family living in Utah, or the divorce of 2 rich white people in Miami, or the custody battle over traumatized children resulting from an affair between rich white people in Manhattan.  Granted, the Laci Peterson case in Modesto does not involve rich people, but they sure are white.  I am willing to bet there have been several suspicious deaths of black or Hispanic victims in the Modesto area in the 18 months since that story appeared.   Why is it that the harsh realities of the lower middle class of varied ethnicity who work one or more jobs every day do not get the same media attention?  For every “high-profile” case that makes it on Dateline or Court TV or 20-20 or all the other shows, there are dozens of similar cases with equally terrible crimes, equally devastated families, and similar legal issues.  Are the crime victims of Oakland and Modesto and Eureka and a thousand other cities and towns not as important as the victims of the Hamptons or Aspen or Beverly Hills?  Does the skin color of the deceased make a murder more or less mysterious or appalling or final?  Is the perpetrator more or less guilty based on the number of zeros on the victims paycheck?  I blame The Media, which seems every day closer to becoming a group of public relations firms, intent on keeping their bosses/clients/supporters in the news every day, no matter what.  The rich corporations and rich individuals who own The Media need to look in the mirror and see their own kind.  The TV becomes that mirror, showing a homogeneous, white and green reflection that is the opposite of the diversity in culture and financial status that accurately reflects our country.  The only time that the media is truly interested in the hardships of minorities or the poor is when they are celebrities (OJ Simpson, who transcended race because of his athletic prowess, comes to mind) or when it directly affects those in power (visible homeless populations are unattractive to a city making a bid for the Olympics, for example).  The network news shows are the worst, but it happens in every media outlet from Peoria to Portland to New York City.  The media took a break from rich people during the aftermath of the 9-11 attacks; that coverage was somewhat sensitive the first few days but quickly degenerated into a race to see which network could find the most heart-wrenching and tragic and ironic story.  In addition, there are people in the media who look for stories that affect families and neighborhoods and communities where normal people live.  In those instances, the resolution of the story and the effect, positive or negative, is just as important as the crime itself.  In particular, I think the America’s Most Wanted show is honestly about solving crimes and bringing justice to all people, no matter what their socioeconomic background.  This is not a blind rant against every white person with lots of money.  I would like to be in that same position some day, and it is not for me to judge how a person earned (or was handed) their wealth.  If I am fortunate enough to earn stacks of money, I hope that I do not suddenly think that my problems outweigh those of my neighbors.  In addition, I certainly do not mean to suggest that the victims of violence or disaster deserve their fate or do not deserve any sympathy.  Death and fear and greed and hate and Mother Nature are still truly and painfully colorblind.  This diatribe is pointed more toward the idea that some persons are more important than others, their hardships are more significant, or their losses any more painful because of their circumstances of wealth or race.  Everybody deserves to have safe homes, safe children, well-built schools, adequate protection from the scourge of drugs.  Everybody deserves to feel like something positive can come from hardship or tragedy.  But please do not feed me the idea that the problems of the upper crust are a fair representation of the problems facing the rest of us.    Am I wrong?  Am I too critical?  Let me know what you think.

      I was salivating while making Nikki's birthday cake last week - it was chocolate with cherry pie filling instead of frosting, 2 layers.  I made it myself to her specifications.  I told Anne I wanted the same cake for my birthday party.  She said "you never want a birthday party, you hate birthdays, you never want anyone to make a big deal about it."  Touche. Fine, then I want a big huge party this year, and everyone I have ever known is invited (except the old bitch, assuming her possessed earthly form still haunts the earth).  I will invite people from high school, college, Goldville, wherever.  In fact, everyone who reads this blog is invited.  See you in the Redwoods next year.  Listening to:  urlLink Ray Wilson , Change, Cry if You Want To.  Scottish singer/songwriter, most famous for being the last singer of Genesis, post-Phil Collins.  VERY good musician and writer.

      For some reason the other day, I skipped.  This is the first time I have skipped in anyone's memory.  I think I may have skipped in 1982 or 1983, but there is no one around to verify that statement.  I was playing around with my son, he was chasing me, when I spontaneously skipped aroung the jog in the hallway.  He stopped suddenly, and with a look of disbelief, said "did I just see you SKIP?"  Yeah, I guess so.  "I didn't know you could skip!"  I've got lots of surprises, kid, just wait for them.

      I am not going to recommend many blogs, because of my blogging philosophy (see earlier posts).  But there is one girl who is an amazingly talented writer.   (She's just a kid, for god's sake, and she's a better writer than me ... oops, excuse the thirty-something jealousy).   Her name is Abby and she has multiple blogs running at the moment.  One site is  urlLink http://wirewings.blogspot.com/ , another is  urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/~greyshaderose/ .  Check her out.  Her poetry is incredible.  I don't know how she gets the ideas for some of her stuff, but she is pretty damn good.  I wish I could be half as witty and insightful.   (...me, fawning with adoration...)   I give her props here because I wanted to steal something on her site.  I will credit her when it is posted.

      Back in 8th grade through 10th grade, I had braces.  Yay, that was fun, especially the bi-weekly clockwise quarter turn. Anyway, as if I wasn’t geeky enough, I had the headgear for s short time, until I simply refused to wear them.  Anyway, this teen moment came after the braces were off, but I still had a retainer my soph year.  I was still getting used to it when one day, I happened to be playing around with a girl (a senior) I had known for several years.  We were just pushing each other a little when she slipped and fell on the floor.  I leaned over to help her up, and at that moment by retainer fell out of my mouth ... onto her fuzzy sweater ... and hooked itself into the fabric right between her breasts.  We were both stunned, but she recovered quick enough to start screaming “oh my GOD”, recoiling in horror from the ghastly orthodontic device.  My first reaction (the wrong reaction, of course) was to attempt to extricate the retainer from her cleavage.  I had one chance, and quickly grabbed it, twisting as if I were removing a hook from a dying fish, but it would not come loose.  At this point I have vomited hardware onto her AND grabbed her chest.  That was too much, and she ran into the bathroom to remove the retainer.  I had to wait for her to come out of the bathroom to get my retainer back.  Obviously, it was slightly awkward between us for a while.  Sorry, Jeanette.

      The more blogs I visit, the more I decide that there are some pretty intellectual people in the world.  We each seem to have our own niche or specialty in which we are knowledgeable.   urlLink Annebrev  knows a lot about botany, biology, and chemistry.   urlLink Jessica  is very well read in philosophy.  I can discuss engineering or drafting or maps, among other things.  There are countless computer experts and writers and movie buffs and musicians blogging.  But the thing is, many of the things bloggers write about are not within their area of specialty, sometimes not even close.  I will never tell anyone I am well-informed about mental health or parenting or psychology, but most of what I have written seems to be focused on those topics.  Maybe the things we most need to get in writing are the things we know the least about.  Never stop learning, never give up on figuring out yourself and the world around you.

      There always needs to be reading material in the men's room. In our office, the reading material is generally geared toward engineers and geologists. There was a Steel Industry publication, promoting use of structural steel in engineering projects. Two fascinating things for non-nerds:  Advertising slogan for  urlLink Applied Bolting Co .  urlLink steel connection nuts :   When It Squirts, You're Done.    Drive It 'Till It Squirts.     There are many suppliers around the nation who will bend steel for you. No, they do not have Superman, but GIANT roller machines that bend steel beams, the easy way or the hard way. Think of a steel I-beam. The easy way is to bend it so the I, looking at you, bend to the right or left. The hard way is to bend it so the I, looking at you, bends up or down. Some places will bo both bends to create a spiral. There are several website with photos, here are two samples:  urlLink Albina Pipe Bending  and  urlLink Bendtec .

      Hello Monday.  Another week at the salt mine.  It's not so bad, really, but sometimes I just get so stuck in the depressive spiral that I want to go postal.  Most people here see me as someone who can get a little nuts sometimes, so the element of fear keeps many people from pushing me too hard - this can be a good thing.   I have not been terribly social the last few days, but I'm not putting myself in a depressive spiral either. Overall, I have been in a decent mood the last week, not super, not "happy", but not too shabby.  I have been on the Effexor for a week now, and I move from 37mg to 75mg tomorrow. The only significant side effects so far are nausea, and intestinal "issues", and (to put it at discreetly as possible) mild sexual side effects, i.e. occasional difficulty maintaining or finishing. (This is not a big issue for me, we both understand it and accept it, so it does not become a problem.) The same side effects happened with Celexa also, from the lowest (10 mg) to highest dose (40 mg).  Hey, you clicked here, don't blame me.  It's all about sharing too much information.

       I'm typing with blue fingers . Since we are buying beds for the kids, this is a good opportunity to paint their rooms the color of their choice. Daniel picked something like an  ocean blue , thus the color of my fingers.  I don't distinguish shades of blue very well, so my reaction was ...  yep, it's blue .  Nikki is going with a  lavender of some sort , which to me is a girley-man  purple .  Anyone who looks at me instantly realizes I have no sense of style whatsoever, in clothes, decor, food, hair, whatever. The Queer Eye guys' personal hell is being locked in a room having to look at people like me for eternity. I don't even hang pictures unless I am REALLY bored, and then only natural scenes, never people. Lucky for me, Anne has a little better sense of taste than me, and I usually defer to her choices in such matters.  Also, I finished the taxes, and I will get back about $500 (after paying $2500 on April 15th). Still sucks. Anne's self-employment penalty, err, taxes are the worst part of it. I guess I need to get a little smarter about how to hide money in a SEP for Anne.

When I'm no longer obsessed with shampoo perhaps I'll study cologne for now your ingredients remain unknown  methylchloroisothiazolinone .  (ouch, my head hurts)

      Today we went and bought beds for the kids.  This morning, home-cooked bacon and eggs, fruit, and sourdough toast for brekkie - yum!  I'm at home now, supposed to be working on stuff, but writing instead.  Oh well, I guess I am really addicted to this writing thing.  The other night I wrote a short story about my grandpa's workshop, what it felt like, smelled like, and how much Mom and I missed him after he died.  I ended up almost crying by the time I was done.  I did no proofreading, but I think it came out pretty good, maybe one of the best things I ever wrote.  I will look at it, then post it here for anyone to read.  I guess I should get one of those creative commons copyright thingees, in case I ever decide to try to get anything published.  I am supposed to be working on taxes!  Yeah, the thing most people do in April.  I got the extension and paid my bill in April, then did not touch anything tax related until today.  I suppose I can get another extension, and just make this a year-round hobby.   Fuck the IRS.  I think someone could rewrite the tax code into a pamphlet smaller than the contract for a home purchase.  It's real simple:  if corporations stop getting deductions over a certain gross income level, and if individuals stop getting deductions over a certain gross income level, and there are smaller tax brackets, I think there will be more than enough taxes for anything we need.  Eliminate about 10% of the government employees at the state and federal level by eliminating redundant agencies and by simplifying laws.  Fly one less shuttle mission per year, and build 9 jets instead of 10.  States do not get a single penny of local property tax, business taxes, fees, or sales taxes.  Finally, a sales tax on everything except fresh food, and people under a certain income level get $__ dollars of sales tax refunded at the end of each month.  Everyone has a smart card that keeps track of the taxes they have paid.  Thanks, send me your payment for $100,000, and I will be glad to fill in the details.

      Another strange dream, not about death but an earthquake.    PART 1:  A giant quake, 9.5 or 10, hits San Diego (basically impossible), and we feel it strongly here in Eureka, 700 miles away (beyond impossible).  SD and LA are basically destroyed, with nearly 100,000 dead and over 5 million injuries - a catastrophic but probably unreasonable number.   Anyway, the whole family is here having dinner, and I feel like I am going to black out, but the shaking starts.  A very strong rolling shake, then a pause of several seconds, then not as strong, the shuddering, sharp shaking (typical quake here, but the timing was all wrong).  In the neighborhood (the street was the same, but all the houses and people were different), a 12 to 13-yr old girl is watching her 9 siblings while the parents are at dinner.  She is scared and hysterical, so Anne goes to help her out.   Fast-forward to the next morning, and we are at some sort of ceremony that is part candlelight vigil, until the jazz band starts up with Buddy Rich and Duke Ellington music.  Anne is mad at me for some reason, so she goes upstairs in this meeting hall and starts working on a computer (this is apparently her job).  My real-life boss Leo is her boss, gives her some encouragement, then looks at me, wondering what the hell I am doing wasting time?  I said "I don't think I work here,", and he says "OK, you don't now!"  The rest of the day, I am trying to find TV coverage of the disaster, but no stations seem to have anything.  They show video from a clogged sewer manhole being pumped behind the NBC studios in Burbank, and Anne's mom says "Oh yeah, we used to live in the hills right behind there."  I am wondering if I am crazy, and ask if there actually was an earthquake, or if I was just dreaming.  Everyone says Oh yeah, we all felt it, you were right here.  I said "why is there no coverage on TV, if this big a disaster happens?"  Nobody answers me, just looking at each other ...   PART 2:  ... then suddenly I wake up (in the dream I wake up; in reality I am still dreaming).  I am saying to Anne "boy that was some weird dream, about this huge earthquake,", and she says "that was real, remember, we all felt it!"  So I head for work, totally confused, to my job as a bank teller in the mall.  As I am headed toward the bank, Donald Trump, coiffed with different but still hideous hair, stops me in the mall about 3 doors down from the bank.  He holds out his Visa Check Card (TM) and says "Hi, I'm Donald Trump, you know, with the Visa Check Card (TM) commercials."  I said, "yeah, we met in New York a few weeks ago."  He said "I need to close out this Visa Check Card (TM) and open a new Cirrus credit card."  [aside:  Cirrus card, are you freaking kidding me?  That was an ATM card from about 10 or 15 years ago, and I don't know if they even still exist.  Not only that, but why Donald Trump, and why had I met him in NY?]  So we go into the First Interstate Bank (which in reality was swallowed by Wells Fargo about 10 years ago), I sit down behind my desk, and I am absolutely clueless about how to do this.  I call the manager, who turns out to be Chevy Chase.  He says "just push the buttons on this keypad," pointing to a 30-year-old device with a greed LED readout.  I punch in some numbers, and the screen says "CALL PETE AT 1-800-...", whatever the number was.  Chevy looks at me, I look at him, we both look at The Donald, and he finally says "Well, call Pete!"  I do so, and Pete is either stoned or has just woke up.  I tell him the machine said to call him, and he says "Is it a Visa Check Card (TM)?"  Yes.  "OK, here are the numbers," and he rattles off a 18-digit number, seeming from random or from memory.  I try not to imagine who or where this guy is as I confirm the numbers and hang up.   Chevy looks at my numbers and says "This can't be right, you have fractions, 6/11, 18/7, let me see this," end makes some seemingly random changes.  Finally I said "so where is the credit card?", and Chevy looks blank for a second, looks at Trump, then says "oh yeah, that could be a problem."  He sticks a receipt in to the ancient machine, it prints some numbers, and he hands the paper to The Donald, who walks away.  ... and I actually wake up slowly, stuck in that nether region between dreamland and reality.  I ask Anne if there was an earthquake, and she says "no, maybe it was just you farting."  OK, I'm back to reality now.

      A followup to the idea of characters or duality:  I noticed yesterday during therapy that I have built another barrier, created another character that I play while I am in a session. I am mostly honest with her, but I am also on my good behavior, the listening, understanding, agreeing me. Underneath, I am thinking " she's trying to psyche me ", " what a load of mind-bender shit ", " what you say is nice here, but not in the   real   world ", or " my friends are better therapists that you ".  Yesterday at the end of the hour, I accidentally let that facade slip a little. She said "see you next week", and I flippantly said "yeah, if you want me to come back...". That got her attention, and she said "what does that mean?" I said that I wasn't sure, it just popped out, and she said maybe I should say what I really was thinking. I said "OK, I'll be here next week if *I* want to come back," which really is what I was thinking, but trying to disguise it in a perceived rejection from her.  After all the talk about not mind reading or assuming the other person's feelings, I still think she was a little taken aback at that exchange, because I think it totally surprised her - she could not hide it. I wasn't too surprised, because I have always been prone to saying exactly what I think, with brutal honesty, at the least appropriate moment, and damn the consequences.  Why am I thinking this way? Have I set her up as an authority or an expert, and now I'm looking for ways to tear her down?  Maybe, I always distrust the "experts" . Have I entered a self-destructive phase where I don't want help?  I don't think so . I really think I have just grown tired of letting someone look at my life who doesn't really understand me, who has some good answers and valid viewpoints, but nothing I could not reach with a little help from friends, or fellow blockers with similar problems.  I guess what I mean to say is that the talk therapy has about reached the end of its rope with me, at least on a weekly basis. I have read a lot, educated myself, and given myself better tools to deal with these issues on my own, with limited assistance.  If you think I'm full of shit, please tell me, and I will be happy to listen.

      I don’t know if this makes any sense or not, but here is a stream-of consciousness idea for your consideration.  I have heard of alcoholics or dug addicts having a brief moment where the logical mind makes one final, intense push for the person’s attention, the so-called “moment of clarity”. I definitely can relate to that from a depression standpoint. No matter how miserable or messed up the Beast has made you feel, there are moments where your logical mind forces you to look at everything about yourself and your world, good, bad, and in between, with a non-judgmental eye. Intervention from friends, loved ones, or even just caring strangers willing to help another human being, is very helpful, but sometimes the realization must come from within. If you can recognize this and honestly appreciate the good parts of life, no matter how briefly, I think it gives strength to carry on, to struggle though the darkness, and hope for recovery.  My heart hurts with the realization that there are many who cannot or will not see the good and gain strength. I think I have gained more compassion for people who seemingly have nothing to live for, but they probably do. It is just hidden too deep for them to see, shrouded in a fog of mental illness or addiction, and it is even more difficult for anyone else to see.

      I am definitely in a split-personality mode right now. Part of me is very content and feeling loved today. Sex with your lover is great, whether it is slow and tender, or throw-me-down-and-take-me-now. Also, Anne thinks it is a good idea for us to get away for our anniversary (2+ weeks) and relax, talk about depression, talk about us, etc. Normally she is very quiet about important stuff, so this is a big deal to me. Without putting too much expectations, I hope we can do some mending and damage repair. She still has not said anything about the aborted runaway, but I believe she maybe understands a little better. She is reading a book I have, partially from my encouragement, partially on her own.  On the other hand, there is the Beast, sitting quietly in the corner, biding his time, waiting patiently for an opportunity to creep back in. All it takes is one slip, one bump in the road, a crack in the armor, for the beast (or black dog, or demon, or critic - it goes by many names) to gain a hold, and start dragging me down again. No matter how happy I am, I am always aware of its presence, in the same way a cat is alert and ready for danger, while appearing to be relaxed. This dual state of being is very tiresome. It is hard to shake it off, except in the most comforting or free moments.

      Here are two poems from essentially the same source: a series of curves in the Trinity mountains, and a dangerously wandering imagination while driving. I like the first one best, with multiple voices and a detached-observer feel. The second is much darker, with first-person suicidal hints, but IMHO not as well written.   Beyond the Lines Driving through the mountains, through the night the cold, grey, constant asphalt hums beneath the wheels No chatter, no slush, no gravel, no squeals  A monotonous road, like a monotonous life, is hard to enjoy no adventure, no challenge to keep you awake. I could fall asleep, or more likely make a mistake  The lines, stretching on, mark a simple boundary between morbid excitement and the continual grey (although the risks are fatal, they say)  Beyond the lines, the desperate risk everything dark, heavy dreams, straining at flight (and plummeting darkness, eternal night)  A brief rush in the moment, weightless and free something different from monotonous grey (blindly discarding all you have today)  A momentary freedom from all the constraints careless disregard for physical laws (but in the end, the plan has its flaws)  In a moment, a final decision is made to escape from a mind-numbing, lackluster life (the body is identified; someone contact his wife)  Caught in a moment between life and death the soul leaves your body, not to return (he failed to negotiate the sharp turn)  Your final gift to your family is a lifetime of heartache and pain. (he slid off the road in the rain)  Locked in a casket of steel and chrome, Your body falls to the river below To the hereafter, your soul must go   One Last Drive I'm driving the final miles on a journey with no end i'm exiting this highway just around the next bend  the grey asphalt stretches ahead a boring, monotonous life flat, endless, a stable roadbed (i wonder how they'll tell my wife)  You've got to stay on this road you must keep moving along fold your wings, keep them stowed there's no flying here, they say it is wrong  The painted lines enforce the rules that define the constraints we share no stopping or turning or pausing to rest don't cross the line, don't you dare  If you stray outside these lines leaving the road, right or left you leave all that you are behind a white boundary between life and death  But i'm here on a mission to see what's beside the road, the interesting part beautiful landscape and scenery the mountains and trees touch my heart  The watchful creatures that line the road are the souls who escaped before a fox, an owl, a possum, a toad hear the destiny in the tires' roar  I'm crossing the line, breaking the rule I can't drive this road any more I'm sure you think that I'm the fool until you find out what's in store.  The road is perched impossibly high upon the canyon wall death for the foolish or unlucky or those who maybe wish to fall  Leaving the pavement much too fast scenery changes to a sullen grey blur I though this beauty would forever last But it's temporary, I'm pretty sure.  I'm falling faster than I thought one can't escape Newton's law. I miscalculated, and now I'm caught. it seems my plan had a fatal flaw.  I always wondered what it felt like to fly now I know, and now I can die.

      I can be real wordy, but I don't have a lot to say the last few days. Sure, the daily grind comes and goes, but who wants to hear about what I ate or what street I took to get home? The only thing worse than being mundane is reading about someone else's mundanity (made up word, but I like it).  One thing that just occurred to me is: Many of the songs, movies, name-brands, or people I dislike are a direct result of my insecurities, and my associating those things with other people having a good time when I am not, therefore fuckkem. Kinda stupid, but true. Two examples: 1) I will never buy a Dodge pickup becaue their commercials epitomize an arrogant, bigger is better, my vehicle represents my manhood, tough-guy male stereotype. 2) There is an 80's song, can't think of the artist or title, but it has the line "you really know how to dance" and was used in Bud commercials. I hate that song and can never listen to it.  I may explore this more in the near future.  Wouldn't it be ironic if this post were several hundred words long?  Not much to say, indeed.  I just needed to prime the pump.

      Last night the TV was on, and my mind was drifting.  There was a commercial involving a couple, where she let him into her apartment.  Anne offhandedly says "How did you get her into bed?  Did you just push her in and shut the door?"  I was so totally confused, and apparently my face showed it?  I was thinking "get who into bed, and why can't I remember?"  Finally, pointing at the TV, I said "get  who  into bed,  that  girl?"  Anne realized why I was so confused and started laughing hard, and after a few moments said "No dopey, how did you get your daughter to go to bed so early?"   It was very funny at the time, even funnier if you were there.  Maybe it doesn't come across so well in print...

      Some days I feel like life is moving past me, and I can't keep up.  This is one of those days, where I sense the feeling that there are important or necessary things for me to do, and fun/enriching things for me to do.  I'm doing none of those, and am instead trying with little or no success to appear busy at work.  As stated before, I am no longer of the opinion that working somewhere else will solve my career angst.  I need an entirely new career, possibly involving entirely different sets of knowledge and skills.  But first, I need to work on myself, becoming whole and powerful.  Too bad I cannot possibly afford to quit working and go back to college for something new.  Choices made, mortgages signed, vows spoken, promises to be kept, lives entrusted, paths already taken.  I always thought that people were never really stuck.  I still believe that, but I now also realize that we sometimes allow ourselves to be held in place, stuck with molasses instead of super glue.  Sometimes the getting unstuck is more difficult that the tedium of marking time.  The rewards of pulling free are hard to see and harder to appreciate when everything around you is urging you to go with the current, don't resist, don't look around, just keep moving along.   People who do great things find the strength to resist the current, while those who are less strong live on in obscurity and grey tedium until they pass the baton for good, hoping their children will have a better life and do great things.  Is that how you know you have given up on life, when you start wishing great accomplishments for your kids, and neglect to care about your own dreams?   I had strength, once.  I resisted the current, for a few memorable moments.  Now I've forgotten how, and the Beast won't let me remember what it felt like.  I want that feeling back, I want to feel like I make a difference to the world, I want to be proud of something I did.  How, I don't know just yet.  It is a work just begun, with very little progress to show yet, but give me a little time.

      The guys in the office are discussing poison oak and its remedies right now. We have VERY large poison oak here, sometimes reaching 50-60 feet tall climbing the trunks of redwood trees - locally known as "old-growth" PO. Very interesting how marching straight through the PO is more macho than "tiptoeing around it like a pansy", this statement from someone who has spent most of the last several months miserable from reaction to PO. Anyway, we always keep the Tecnu around.  Actually, I seem to be one of the few people who has very little to no reaction to poison oak, yet I am allergic to every other plant on the planet. A single flower blooms, and I sneeze my ass off. I get a severe contact reaction to any plant that scratches me, especially grasses. I am most susceptible to grasses, pollen, trees, and mold. That covers nearly everything. I think I can tolerate saprophytes.

      Well, well. It IS Monday, like it or not, and I am so not ready to work. I need strong coffee, NOW.  I slept for about 15 minutes at home, holding my socks.  Anne gave me a nudge, and I said "I'm late", but I wasn't.  My last item Friday afternoon sounds pretty bad, but in fact the weekend went okay. Not super, but not dark and depressed either. Yard sale on Saturday, we made about $170. Sunday was very lazy, sit around, watch movies, do a little garage cleaning, take leftover stuff to Salvation Army. Late last night, Anne and I "played" for about an hour - very fun, but a little frustrating due to nature's monthly visit. OK, sorry, too much info, but I think we've all been there.  I am  such an IDIOT ! About 8:00 last night, I remembered I had promised to help someone from the office clean out a storage locker ... at 10 AM! I SO totally forgot. I hate when other people say things then don't follow through, then I do it to someone else! I need to buy an expensive housewarming gift to make up for it. Any suggestions??
