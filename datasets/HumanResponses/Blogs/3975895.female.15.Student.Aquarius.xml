       Happiness cannot come&nbsp; from without. It must come from within.   So I went to the park with my brother this morning, and i sat there under the sun reading! Read "Teen love series", on relationship. Quite interesting I gotta say.&nbsp; After reading it, I got a lot happier, maybe perhaps I realized that things in the book is true, and it helped me realize some things. I gotta learn howta love myself in order to be loved. Keke! I'm happy today, even though I didn't go out. But I'm gonig to the gym tomorrow to work out, and going to TO!!! Whoo&nbsp; hoo! Getta finally see Ga!!! AFter two months, finally!!! And might getta see gor!! KEkeke! Gunnahave so much fun this weekend!! I'm soo tanned!! Keke! I think i'm toast! =)

       My life resembles a  rollercoaster . Ups and downs. They come unexpectedly, so you never know when you will be up, and when you will be down. I'm sick and tired of this endless ride. It's  not   fun , and I want to get off. Sometimes, I just don't know why i'm feeling down. Trust me, it's not pmsing. It's just everytime I see certain things, or realizes certain things, it makes me upset. Maybe I should stop looking and thinking 'bout it, maybe I'll be better off? But I don't want to. I feel  invisible .

       I seem to have&nbsp;forgotten the difference between dreams and reality.&nbsp; I sleep, and I dream..but when I do, everything seems so real, infact,  TOO  real. I wake up, not knowing if what&nbsp;I dreamt 'bout really happened or was it just simply a dream that will never come true. Everyday I wake up, hoping that it's all true, but once I regain my consciousness, I know that for a fact, it was  JUST  a dream.

       It's funny how things can change so fast. A couple months ago, we were as close can we can be, now? I'm just this girl that takes up too much of your time. Without a doubt, you've changed lots. Maybe it's&nbsp; just your personality. But why can't I stop thinking 'bout it? Why do I care 'bout it so much when you don't even realize how much this is troubling me? Why am I so stupid?    I miss talking to you day and night, on the phone or on msn. I want the old you back.

       Whats the meaning behind the words " True Friends"?  Sometmies, we get so mad at our close friend or whatever, and we say we don't care about them anymore and tat they're not worth our time. Is that true? Thats not how I see it. It's cause we still care and love that friend of ours so much that we bother getting mad at little things that they do that bugs you. It's cause you still care 'bout them. If it was just some random person, I probably wouldn't even care if they're about to go screw themselves over. It's cause i care 'bout her, thats why i even bother getting mad at her and getting frustrated at the things she does wrong. It's cause deep down, I still love her very much. Even though after all those not so nice things she's ever done to me, including ditching, lying, rudeness, taking me for granted. I still love her.      I had a very nice talk with Jasy yesterday when we were walking to Zehrs to get some food for the movie nite. And I guess we all go thru something similar like that. Each and every last one of us. It's juss the matter of how to treat this problem and to improve it. Relationships are not one-sided. It takes both to put effort in it. I'm glad I had jasy to talk things out with. Consider we were half talking and half laffing our heads off throughout the convo. I guess i'm glad I moved to Waterloo, it's been a year since I've moved here. So much has happened, so much have gotten me further in life. So much has helped me grown and mature. I've met so many new friends, and grew to see that theres so many people out there that are willing to care for me, if i juss give them a chance to. I've met friends like Jasy, Jo, Kat, Dora, Tiff, Amanda, Esther, Victoria, and a lot more that i can go on listing. They were there when I was invisible. They helped me through times that I myself cannot bear alone. We've grown to trust each other and help each otherthrough things. Yes, there may be this age gap, but so what? We don't feel it at all. I'm glad that God moved my family to Waterloo, allowing me to meet new friends and realize what a true friend really is.

       I guess retreat wasnt as good as I wanted it to be. But i guess not everything's 'bout me sometimes. I gotta learn that it's not always 'bout myself..but others as well. Gotta start learning to put others in front of myself..to think 'bout Jesus furst, then others, then myself. Retreat was awesometho, even tho i was tired most of the time..cuz of sleeping late, i still had tons of fun! But things weren't so great aside from those good things...i'm starting to get skared..starting to feel disappointed...starting to not believe what i should believe. Speechless. But i'm also happy, cuz Alan's my gor again, and it feels just like how it used to be! me very happy 'bout that! Me so tired..went to Abby's house for bbq..and she drove us to TCBY..soo fattening, but i ate some.and threw out the rest..but yeah..played cards after..reallee phunniee!!!! But now i'm home and tired. So i guess i'll head off to bed now!

       VBS is AWESOME!! It's so fun! Singspiration and skits with the kids is soo much fun! They participate most of the time, making us the leaders feel so good to do all that work for them. It's all worth it in the end! The Monkeys are sooo kyute! My Coconuts are cute too, but they're not as hyper and active! But that's okay! I absolutely love Stephanie and Janice! They're like my two favorite kids! So kyute, so energetic! I love it! Took lots of pictures with them! I can't wait till Friday!! When Jo and Jasy and Karen are all going to be here!! It'll be soo fun! So many people!! Awesomee!!!

       Where there is pain, I wish you peace and mercy. -Where there is self-doubting, I wish you a renewed confidence in your ability to work through it. -Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, I wish you understanding, patience, and renewed strength. -Where there is fear, I wish you love, and courage.

         Again            If when you wake up in the morning,   And the hurting is so great,   You don't want to get out of bed   And face a world of hate.      If everything in life goes wrong   And nothing you do seems right,   You just try a little harder   And soon you'll see the light.      For every person who has put you down   And filed your life with pain,   You must strive to achieve gretaness   And show them you can win.      For every disappointment,   For the times you are let down,   There will be a better moment   And your life will turn around.      Because everyone feels heartache   And everyone feels pain,   But only those who have true courage   Can get up and try again.      -Teal Henderson

       I feel invisible. Friends that sees you when you're invisible are the ones worth trusting. Those friends aren't easy to find. Sometimes, maybe even the people who are closeest to you arent trustworthy. I guess I think too much. Go too indepth when I think, making things seems so comlpicated to me even though it can the simpliest thing ever.    As each day passes, I learn more things about life. Sometimes, it ends up in disappointment, sometimes it ends up with encouragement. I wonder how I would be,  WHO  I would be, if certain things in my life that never took place. Would I still be the same Vivian I am now? I seem to have lost trust in a lot of people, I feel that I can't trust them anymore. I can't tell them things like I used to be able to. They seem to be all changing into a whole new person that I totally don't like. I'm scared, I truly am. I just wanna go back to my invisibleness. Then noone can see me, and I can't see anyone. Build myself 4 big walls secluding myself, where I won't fel pain or hurt. Maybe that'll be better for me, and other people. Going to the stupid dentist today, he's going to cry, but whatever, who the hell cares.
