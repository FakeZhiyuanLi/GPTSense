      It's the weekend!  It's the weekend!  I don't have a whole lot of excitement on the go but it's going to be a busy one.  In 30 minutes I teach my first workshop of the summer for the Young Millionaires Program.  I'm not nervous at all; just excited to get going.  This afternoon I'm heading up to my folks to help with some gardening and then tonight I'm heading to Ch'town.  I'm gonna spend the evening with Donovan since I haven't seen him in FOREVER and then spend the night with Ethan.  Tomorrow is MY BIRTHDAY!  Yippee! I'm looking forward to a day of relaxation.  Ethan and I will get up for Coronation Street and then I think we're going to head to Cora's for breakfast then catch a movie in the afternoon.  Tomorrow evening I think Joanne and Jerry are going to have Mom and Dad down for a BBQ for my birthday.  27 years old.  I thought I'd have more accomplished by now but hell, if I dwell on it, I'll drive myself nuts so I'm just going to keep on movin' on.    Anywho, I have a little more prep to do before my workshop begins so I best get to it.  ******A huge WELCOME BACK to Nadine and Jonny...I can't wait to hear all about your trip!!!!!

      Well, my birthday weekend is off to a fabulous freakin' start.  I drove into the bank this morning to cash my paycheque before going into work, went in, got some money, came back to my car and it wouldn't freaking start. Crap, crap, crap... I CANNOT afford this! Sooooo....once again I have to call my parents, say my car is broken down, and can I use your credit card?  Fuck.  I hate when shit like this happens because I feel like such a little kid.  Like, will I ever get my shit together and be financially responsible?!?!??! What a bummer...

      Morning Everyone!  Hope everyone had a chance to enjoy the 29 degree weather yesterday.  I would have enjoyed it had I the chance to sit outside in it but instead I had to work AND THEN sit in the gymnasium of Athena Elementary for Jennifer's band concert.  It was hotter then hell in there!  Her band was surprisingly good; she plays in the concert band and the jazz band.  I have a feeling that since I'm living with my sister and her family that many of my blog posts will at some point sing the praises of my very talented nieces!!!  I was in bed last night by ten and slept in until eight.  I'm fully rested and in a kick ass mood today.  My workday is sort of short today.  I'm here until after lunch; then I go to Montague for the afternoon/early evening.  Since I'm the Provincial Coordinator for the Young Millionaires Program, today I'm going to sit in on the workshops being conducted on the eastern end of the Island.  What is the Young Millionaires Program you might ask? It's basically my main duty of the summer.  I'm the Provincial Coordinator as well as the western queens/eastern prince facilitator.  It's a program designed to assist youth between the ages of 8 to 16 years old discover more about business by teaching them basic business skills and by helping them start their own business for the months of July and August.  The participants attend a series of workshops that cover basic business skills like marketing and record keeping.  When they finish the workshops they submit a business plan for the opportunity to receive up to $100 (non-repayable grant) to start their business.  I think the program is going to make for a real fun summer for me.  Once the workshops are complete, I spend the rest of the summer visiting all the different businesses and setting up opportunities for them to sell their product or market their service.  For instance, we'll set up at the Lobster Carnival Sidewalk Sale and things like that.  I'm thinking of actually making a Young Millionaires blog as another method of communication with the participants.  That way I can also post pictures that I take during the summer, etc.  Anywho, I best get to work!!!    Take care

      With many thanks to Amy, I have the beginning of a BLOG.  I'm still fiddling with it, but it's up and running.  It's really quite fun...and time consuming (I've done very little work today!!!)  I've been looking for pictures to add to the side...currently there are:  - stargazer lilies (my favorite flower) - a bonsai tree (I think it would be cool as hell to know how to cultivate them) - an aerial view of Tyne Valley (my old stompin' grounds)  I guess my motivation for starting a BLOG is to have a central location to post information on what is going on with me.  I hope y'all will check in on me from time to time.

      It's Friday!  It's Friday!  The weekend is here...thank goodness!  I'm pooped!  Between workshops and our Annual Meeting at work, I've had one evening off all week.  The rest I've been working.    I think tonight is going to be a quiet, girly night with Jennifer.  Maybe rent 50 First Dates???    I teach a workshop tomorrow morning and then I'm heading into town to see Ethan.  I haven't seen him all week, and barely spoke to him.  Living in two cities is getting easier though.  Thank being so busy at work for that.  The only time I find it difficult is when I actually talk to him on the phone.  I'm soooo happy at first to hear his voice but the point where I have to say good-bye is totally sucky.   Parting is such bittersweet sorrow...   Our conversations now usually end with him saying "keep your chin up"  Sunday is Fathers Day...bbq and lobster although I have no idea what to get my father for Father's Day.    Well shit...I just finished talking to my friend Chole on-line.  She's in Australia and moving to New Zealand at the end of the month for a year.  Lucky bitch!  I wish I could save money to go someplace...do you know that except for Nadine's stagette, I have not been off the Island since March 2003.  That's absolutely ridiculous!  Anywho, I should get to work.    p.s. Professor Dave is home!!!!  Yeah hooray!!!!

      Tonight I teach my first marketing workshops to the participants in the Young Millionaires Program. I’m here until 8 o’clock tonight so I’ve been pacing myself workwise this morning.  For some reason, I started searching friends’ names in google.  This is what I found so far:    urlLink Ruth Dawson       urlLink Adam Genge       urlLink Amy Sprague       urlLink Nadine Reeves       urlLink Julie Clow       urlLink Charlene Gillis       Some things you may have noticed... Although Nadine's last name is now Stevens...I put a link to Nadine Reeves only because the story of Nadine Reeves was about how her son had been killed by cops (not so happy) Julie (by far) had the most actual articles about herself or that she had written Charlene actually wrote that paper at Mount A And obviously, the others are not my real friends.  Kinda blows my mind that there are other people in the world named the same because as far as I'm concerned my friends are one of a kind!!!!  Corny eh?!?!?!

       Monday, Monday   Ba da, ba da da da  Can't trust that day   Ba da, ba da da da  Monday, Monday   Ba da, ba da da da  It just turns out that way   Ba da, ba da da da  Oh, Monday, Monday   Ba da, ba da da da  Won't go away   Ba da, ba da da da  Monday, Monday   Ba da, ba da da da  It's here to stay   Ba da, ba da da da  Oh, Monday, Monday   Ba da, ba da da da    The Mamas and the Papas   Morning Everyone!  Hope you all had a good weekend!  How was the housewarming party?  the party at the Bitter End?  I had a good weekend.  Saturday night was pretty lowkey.  Had a few beer and puffs at Ethan's and was in bed by 12:30ish.  We watched Coronation Street, drank coffee, and ate croissants in the morning.  I had a cat nap after Coronation and then Ethan took me out for breakfast.  We were going to go to Cora's but there was a huge lineup so we went to Smitty's instead.   Yesterday afternoon I headed back to Summerside for a birthday BBQ with the family.  It was BEE-YOO-TEE-FUL on Joanne and Jerry's deck.  I can't wait for the 3rd!!!  Drank some beers in the sun and ended up heading to bed around 7:30 to read and I'm sure I was out like a light by 8:00!  A perfect, relaxing day.  Deeder and Charl called me yesterday.  It was good to talk to them; I've been pretty bad with phone calls since I moved to Summerside.  Anywho, my desk looks like a tornado hit it so I think I better do some organizing.  Have a fabulous day!

      Well, I've got a long day ahead of me but once it's over I'm settling in for a long weekend!  Yippee!  I'm so pumped! I hope that because of my excitement that the day flies by and doesn't drag along forever!  So I have a long weekend this weekend, then I have next Thursday off for Canada Day...depending on the weather I think I'm taking next Friday afternoon off...and also contemplating taking the 5th off.  We're now doing the pool party/BBQ thing on July 4th.  That'll be good.  Saturday we may have been on more of a mission...but there's nothing better then having some drinks on the patio and swimming in the pool on a lazy Sunday afternoon and then heading to bed around eight or nine, perfectly content!  Anyways, I've got some shit to get together so I best get my day started.  Cheers!

      I was just going through old papers and found the results from my Myers-Briggs Personality Test that I ddi earlier in the year.  Myers-Briggs is probably the most used personality type indicator test.  Anywho, I am an ISFJ...I went on the web and found a description... **************************************************************** You are sympathetic, loyal, considerate, and conscientious. You will go to any amount of trouble, when it makes sense to you, to help those in need. You are responsible and enjoy being needed. You are down-to-earth and realistic and like others who are quiet and unassuming. You absorb and enjoy using a large number of facts.   You like situations where the rules are well defined and where traditions are to be upheld. You focus on providing practical help and services for others and for the organizations you serve. You have a strong work ethic.   You can be painstakingly accurate and systematic in handling tasks...you're conservative with traditional values...quiet and modest...tactful and supportive of friends and family...   You are often self-effacing in getting the job done, and are willing to make necessary sacrifices, especially for your family. You are at your best quietly providing assistance and making sure things are in order.   You have a few close friends, don't like disharmony, and try to keep cooperation at all costs...you'll stay close friends with that tight circle for a LONG time...worry a lot...   You need to have things organized in a way you think works.. you cannot work when things are out of order...when things are in disarray, you have to reorganize 'em immediately....you get involved with leisure ONLY after all the work is done...   You have a tendency to put off relaxing because there's too much work to be done...you enjoy time with your family...you fall in love hard when you fall. You place a high value on marriage and family...you seek out a partner and feel unfulfilled without one. you most likely are a good student because you diligently follow through in your work to please your teachers.....you learn best by DOING...   You tend not to be the center of attention...often appear serious...others like trying to get a laugh or a smile out of you...you get angry or bitter when scorned...but you keep it inside...   Possible blindspots: because you are SOOOO in the present, you have a hard time seeing possibilities or consequences of your actions...can become mired in the daily grind...don't forget to express your bottled-up feelings...you can be taken advantage of....could be pessimistic about the future because it's unknown and you rely on past experiences.....you want to plan too much.   ISFJ: "I Serve Family Joyfully"   **************************************************************** What do you think?  Sound like me?

      Hi all!  Work is busy today!  I just looked at the clock and it's 11:20...I've been working steady since I got in this morning.  It's nice to have the day off on Friday but it kinda sucks fitting 5 days of work into 4.  After being bummed about not talking to Ethan the other night, I ended up talking to him like 3 times yesterday plus one REALLY cute voicemail from him on my cell phone as well.  He's so cute!  Tonight they're having a "hardcore BBQ" at there place.  Four bands...Buried Inside (from Ottawa), Doctor Unk, Cheers to Beers, Gruesome Feast and another band Poison.  I've been to the last two shows at their place.  The turnout is pretty amazing.  They do it all-ages, no alcohol allowed, and even though the kids are thrashing around like crazy their respectful at the same time.  Besides the bands, their BBQing veggie burgers and dogs, having salad etc.  I've chosen not to attend though, I'm opting for a night with my Ruby Tuesday.  I'll see Ethan tomorrow night and all day Friday!!!!  So yes, tonight I'm hanging with Ruth...we may veg and watch a movie, or possibly head into the Heritage Pub for trivia to meet up with some of the other nurses she works with. My cash flow is pretty limited so I'm hoping just to hang and watch a movie.  Anyways, my life is unexciting...I don't know why I'm continuing to ramble.  Hope y'all having a great day.

      I'm happy to report that I FINALLY talked to "my baby"  Christ, I feel like a hormonal twit...I mean last week we went 3 or 4 days without talking to each other...this week I go one and I'm in the depths of despair!!!!  Anyways, I talked to him briefly and we had a good little giggle about what a cornball I am.  I got the standard "I Love You" and "Chin up" and I was good to go.  The plan is I'll head up to Ch'town after my workshop on Thursday night.  He works all day Thursday so after a little puff we'll both probably be ready for bed (wink, wink, nudge, nudge).  Friday we're both off...yippee...so we can sleep in a little, run whatever errands, and then head to Joanne and Jerry's.  Any suggestions for what I could cook for supper on Friday night?

      Hi All: Phew! What a night last night!  I was sooooooooo homesick for living in Ch'town and being a "hop in the car" away from visiting my friends...Not a big deal, it's that time of the month but I was one sad chicken last night. All the talk yesterday about how I was looking forward to having a romantic night with Ethan on Friday had me missing him in a HUGE way yesterday.  I tried him in the morning, he was asleep...tried him in the evening he was at work...tried him even later...he wasn't home... in the midst of all this, I watched 50 First Dates which made me think of him and then also started reading my new book which was girly and made me laugh but also a bit sappy.  All in all, I missed my boyfriend and didn't get the opportunity to talk to him...Sometimes I really hate living in Scummerside.  I like my job and I have a great arrangement with Joanne and Jerry but I don't know...I still feel confined sometimes...Ch'town isn't that far away but fuck,...anyways...as you can tell, I'm still in a "mood" today...I'll post again when I'm in a more positive frame of mind

      I hope everyone had a great weekend; I certainly had a fun one!  I got home from work on Friday and immediately opened a "cold one."  Drank some beers with Joanne and Jerry and then we headed for the Quality Inn for the Summer Shake-up Meet and Greet. The Summer Shake-Up is put on by the Prince Country Street Rod Association every two years.  People bring their old cars from all around the Maritimes and it's basically a big "piss-up"  I had alot of fun, got pretty tipsy and only spent five bucks!  Saturday morning, I taught a workshop for the YM Program and then headed to Ch'town.  I laid on Ethan's couch for about two hours feeling totally crappy and then we went out and about.  We went to Indigo, Ethan bought me a new book,  Straight Talking  by Jane Greene, a British author that I really like.   Amy: Remember me telling you about the book  Mr. Maybe  that I loaned Alana one time? This book is by the same author.  I've read a few of her books... Babyville, Jemima J., Bookends, Mr. Maybe,  and now I'm reading  Straight Talking .  It's not my usual forensic science mystery type book.  It's light, fluffy reading about groups of girlfriends and the trials and tribulations of womanhood.  They always tend to make me laugh out loud and I can often draw comparisons with "my girls"  I also bought another book,  4 Blondes , by the author that wrote the book  Sex and the City  which inspired the TV series.  I'll dig into it next.  So yes, book shopping was the highlight of my Saturday afternoon.  I also picked up another Woody Allen movie for my collection.  Saturday night, Ethan and I ordered in pizza...some of his guy friends stopped by so I snuck upstairs to start reading my book while he stayed downstairs, drank beer, and hung out with the boys.  He came upstairs with me around 9:30 and we watched movies, etc.  It was perfect, totally relaxing...I love him!!!  Yesterday morning started with  Coronation Street , then I packed up, spent Father's Day up home, and crashed early with my new book.  I got to catch up on some phone calls...Congrats to Alana and Sarah for winning the Amazing Race on Saturday!!!!  Anyways, I have CRAPLOADS of work to do today...I'm taking Friday off and giving myself a long weekend so I best prepare for that.  I'm totally pumped too because Ethan is off on Friday...Joanne and Jerry leave for Florida on Friday...for the first time since I moved to Scummerside we'll actually have some "alone time."  Yippee!!!!!!!!  Hope you're all having a fabulous day!!!

         How's everyones weekend been so far?  Mine's been awesome!  Except for a slight hangover yesterday which I slept off in the afternoon.  Went down to Ch'town for Sam Roberts last night...I ended up listening to him and the Trews from Ethan's place.  I just DID NOT have the gumption to be amongst throngs of drunk people since I was only feeling so-so from the night before.  Ethan worked until eight and we were both starving so we listened to the tunes from his place...chowed down on some food from the Superstore and chilled.  It was a wonderful, relaxing evening.  Also, we watched the movie  Pieces of April  with Katie Holmes in it.  Have any of you seen it?  I highly recommend it...there were funny parts and at the end of it, I was crying and when I looked over at Ethan, he was crying too.  Doesn't that melt your heart?!?!?!  Very good movie.  Hung out at Ethan's this morning and now I'm off to the grocery store for provisions for tomorrow.  It's supposed to be 21 tomorrow with cloudy periods.  Sounds decent for the patio/pool/bbq party.  It'll be nice to get a group together here although there are will be people missed (like you Amy!!!)  I'm hugely looking forward to it though.  Anywho, I best get to it...Ruth is coming over later so i don't want to miss her.  Hope you're all having a fabulous day.   Ames:  I'm so glad to hear that the show went so well last night.  I'll hoop up with you via telephone soon so I can hear all about it!!!!

      Morning y'all...note I didn't say "good morning"...what's so good about it?  I'm at work...I'm tired...and slightly hungover...  I had a kickass Canada Day yesterday...how about you folks?  I was up at 'em early yesterday morning...after my post yesterday, I finished cleaning and then vegged by the pool for about four hours.  I floated on the floaties in the pool, I swam and played with the beach ball with my niece, I sat and drank beer on the patio with my sister it was fun.  About four, I showered and got ready to head to ch'town.  I arrived at Ethan's to find him, his roommate, and other friends drinking beer on the porch...I grabbed my cooler of beer and there was a collective cheer.  I am proud to say that yesterday I successfully paced myself drinking.  I was a happy, talkative, tipsy girl...but once I get to that point the drinks usually go down faster and then I'm hammered...not yesterday...I succeeded in pacing myself!  yeah for me!  Ethan, Donovan, and I went to Dr. Dave's for BBQ last night.  Sheldon and Marina were there as well.  Ethan and I went down to Dylan's for the fireworks and the three of us went to Baba's for Port Citizen.  I saw Brodie Read for the first time since he got home this summer...he looks fabulous as ever.  Leah Quimby was home as well.   Deeder:  Leah says "hello" and "congratulations"....I also ran into Dale Gaudet who passes on his heartfelt congratulations...he started talking about you guys in highschool, and then how happy he felt to have all us girls to hang out with at the dorm back in first year...he was almost a little misty-eyed...it was cute...also congrats from Heather Panton.. Ames:  Leah says "hello" as well and that she wished she could have seen you while she was home and that she misses you like crazy.  I told her about the burlesque show this weekend and that you were performing as Lulu Sassamafrass...she absolutely loved that you were doing that!!!  So yes, left Baba's around 12ish...got pizza...Ethan had a slight altercation with some redneck idiot that started going on about "fucking skateboards" and tried to take his skateboard...that got smoothed over quickly and we went home where I promptly passed out...  Now I'm at work...but only till lunch, then I'm going to fill the propane tank for the BBQ and nap by the pool.  Can't wait for Sunday...it's going to be 21 and no rain!!!!  Oh, and Sam Roberts tonight...I LOVE HIM!!!!!!

      Happy Canada Day!!!!!  No work for me today!  I had great plans of sleeping in then rolling out of bed and onto the patio for some tanning time.  Nope!  Not in the cards.  I woke up first around twenty after six, which is when my alarm usually goes off in the morning....then I couldn't sleep past ten to eight...I just layed there...I feel tired but I couldn't fall back to sleep.  So it's 8:40 and I've already vacuumed, uncovered the pool, emptied the garbages, made my bed, started laundry, and am cooking breakfast.  Ah well, they say it's good to try to keep you sleep schedule as routine as possible.  So, I'm up...what to do today?!!?!?  I think I'm going to go for a walk after breakfast...I have to do laundry and pack for Ch'town...I HAVE to lay on the patio and swim in the pool....go to Dave's for a BBQ...go to Ch'town for the fireworks...perhaps go see Port Citizen at Baba's.  I work tomorrow...for a bit...I'm not sure how long of a day I'll put in.  I'm excited to watch the fireworks with Ethan tonight.  Not that it's that big of a deal but Ruth and I went to see the ones in Borden last night and I just can't wait to smoke a big doobie, walk down to the water front and snuggle up against Ethan to watch them.  I hope he's not cranky tonight.  Although he prefers working the morning shifts (which is what he's doing today)...he's cranky as a bear when they're finished.  At least I'm prepared for it.  I should check my breaky before it burns.  Christi

      Despite my lack of sleep over the last couple of days, I was up and at 'em this morning.  It's soooo sunny, the birds are chirping...I uncovered the pool this morning and it was 72 degrees which is the warmest it's been in the afternoon (after having all day) since Joanne and Jerry left so it should be perfect when I get home from work tonight. Anyone up for swim? Alas, most of you that read this blog are in HALIFAX or CALGARY.  Ethan and I made up last night.  I went to his house and he was upstairs napping in his room.  I knocked and went in and he smiled...then, as if remembering he was supposed to be mad at me, he kinda got stonefaced again.  Things were a little wonky for the first 20 minutes I was there...but things are OK now.  At one point, he took my face in his hands and said "you need to know that I would never do anything to hurt you..."  Of course, I believe him.  The other night spawned from me being alone in the house for and having far too long to think.  Tonight, I am RELAXING.  I'm gonna swim in the pool, possibly get the BBQ tank filled up tonight, FINALLY take the opportunity to sit in the jacuzzi, and most likely rent some sort of girlie DVD. Perfect.  Tomorrow, I'm spending Canada Day by the pool and Canada Night with my baby.  We're gonna go to the fireworks, etc. Friday, I'm working a half-day and then going to see the Trews and Sam Roberts...Saturday and Sunday will be spent by the pool...hopefully...one friggin' forecast says rain...one says sunny with cloudy periods...I'm hoping for the latter.  Anyways, I've got tons of work to do.  The guy that did this job for me didn't write a final report when he left so now I'm left with writing the report for him.  Whatever, I enjoy writing those types of things and now that me and Ethan are back on track I'm on the top of the world.  Talk to you all soon.  p.s.  It was really nice getting to talk to ya last night Ames!

      Morning!  I feel like crapola today!  Didn't sleep very well again last night.  I've got a busy day ahead of me to keep my mind off the fact that I still haven't talked to Ethan.  I'm doing interviews all day...and 6-8 this evening for the kids applying to the Young Millionaires Program.  Thank goodness! Something to keep my mind occupied.  Anyways, I best get prepared and in a better frame of mind before the day begins.  Have a great Tuesday

      It's not often that a person says those words but I'm really glad to be back to a normal workday.  At least there is stuff at work to keep busy with and keep my mind off my fight with Ethan last night.  I talked to Donovan...he assured me that Ethan loves me and that he'll forgive me for being a retard last night.  He tried to convince me to call last night but knowing how stubborn Ethan can be...I knew he wouldn't answer the phone.  That's our problem when we get into these stupid little fights...we're both stubborn and they turn into huge, disastrous fights.  I just called and ordered him a plant.  He went to work this morning... and I wanted to do something to extend an "olive branch" before we actually talked on the phone tonight...if we talk.  I sent him the plant...he has to call me...because as much as I overreact with the whole jealousy thing sometimes...he knows I'm like this...I wish he could accept it.  He always gets offended though and then gets all defensive which just further fuels my paranoia. Neither of us do anything to rectify the situation...just wait and let it blow over.  What happens the time that I piss him off so much and he thinks "well if she thinks I'm doing it, I might as well just go out and do it..."  I think I have a generalized anxiety disorder.  Ironically enough, the only house plant that  Hearts and Flowers  had in stock was a Peace Lily.  I had them sign the card "sorry about last night; hope to see you on Wednesday night.."  Before the fireworks started last night, the plan was he would come down on Wednesday...  Anyways, I don't want to think about it...if I think about it then I have to come to a decision...do something to fix it...I usually never fix it...at about this point (a little over a year) I always seem to turn into a three-headed monster, drive the guy away and then can say "he broke up with me...his mistake" I guess I have to decide whether or not Ethan is worth finally doing something about myself for...I think he is...if he is, where do I start?

      So I just got into a huge, stupid fight with Ethan...  Sometimes I honestly don't know if I have it in me to do this relationship thing with me in Summerside and Ethan in Charlottetown.  It's like 45 minutes away but...  I'm not a trusting individual in a relationship.  I don't know if I ever will be again.  I was never a jealous or not trusting girlfriend until Chris...until I found out that I was the girlfriend in Charlottetown and there was another one in Halifax.  Ethan has never done anything to lead me to believe that he would ever cheat on me...my mind plays tricks with me though.  Last night he was supposed to call.  It's common that he forgets to call.  He just gets caught up "hanging" at the house with the boys.  I talked to him today and I wasn't upset about it until he tells me about going out last night.  So I start with the "you could have called for like two minutes before you went out with the boys..."  And my mind starts questioning things like..."he had no money when he was with me...how can he afford to go out with the boys?"  We don't talk for a few days and I think I wonder what he's doing, or who he's with that he can't take a few minutes to call me...  This having the house to myself isn't all I thought it would be cracked up to be.  Too much time on my hands...I'm so afraid my mind is going to get the best of me and I'm going to screw everything up with Ethan...I feel so pathetic...I wish I could get over this insecurity...$&%?$&$*$%

      Just got home from a great evening....  Flim called this evening and invited me over to where he and Lynn are house-sitting.  Great group of people, good talks and a little bit of card playing action.  Off to bed...

      Wow!  Although my days at work have seemed to creep along...the week has flown by!  So much to do!  The house isn't that messy but my evening tonight will be spent getting the house in order for Joanne and Jerry's return on Saturday.    I went out for supper with my friend Kim Curley (from Banff) last night.  We met up in Cavendish, had supper, then strolled the Boardwalk.  My god, what a ripoff that place is.  We intended to try the mini-golf at Ripley's Believe It or Not...that was until the girl told us it was going to be just under 21 dollars for the two of us!!!  Talk about ridiculous!  I was super sleepy last night so I headed to bed early but couldn't sleep...isn't that the way.  I think PMS is setting in.  Once again...not much to say...I should get to work.

      Morning All!  I don't really have alot to say today.  I took yesterday off... it was dismal and rainy...Ethan and I had a lazy day together but not particularly exciting...Cameron and Ruth came over last night which was nice...I'm tired today; haven't slept well the past few nights...AND I don't feel like being at work today.  I wish I could sleep on the patio and putter around the house vacuuming, etc.  Anywho, I'll post again if I come up with more to say!  Happy Humpday!!!

      The booze and conversation must have kept me distracted yesterday...I didn't feel myself get bit once, or really even notice any mosquitoes...but I'm covered with them and itching like crazy...especially the one directly on the top of my head!!!!  Yesterday was a blast!  Cameron, Alana, their Ethan (as opposed to my Ethan), Ruth, Nadine, Julie, Dave, and Andrew were all over for the afternoon/evening...Lynn was able to come over in the evening as well.  Nothing of great excitement occurred...it was just wonderful to be together in a group and laugh and talk.  Ethan's coming up tonight with Cameron for the night.  I think I'll take him to see Spiderman tonight!  We both have tomorrow off.  Unfortunately, tomorrow is supposed to be rainy but I'm sure we can think of things to keep us busy indoors.  Anywho, I best get to work...I have alot of things to get accomplished before I take tomorrow off.  Hope you all have a fabulous day!!!!

      I'M BAAACK!  Well the last two days were fun!  Beautiful, sunny days and I got to be outside for both of them.  Although we only did the Sidewalk Sales for six hours each day, it was tiring.  Tuesday night I had an hour nap when I got home.  Last night, I had supper, went to downstairs to start laundry about 6:45, was asleep at about seven and didn't wake up until 3:30 this morning and I successfully went back to sleep and slept until 7:15.  I feel rested today, I guess.  I'm torn about whether to take tomorrow off or not.  Ethan has today and tomorrow off...sort of.  They're shorthanded at work so today and tomorrow he has to go in for a few hours in the morning.  Anywho, I wanted to possibly pack the cooler with some beer and snacks and go to Blooming Point for the day...I mentioned it last night but he's always in a dither now.  His job is OK but he doesn't love it and he's working alot of hours so he's always cranky, which doesn't go over well with me since I'm in a different town not knowing what's going on.  I ended up just saying that I would talk to him later.  I don't know, I may take tomorrow off and go to the freakin' beach myself with some beer.  Anyways, I've got work to catch up on since I haven't been here for the past few days.  Later

      It's been a few days since my last post... Ethan was reading my BLOG the other day...he says "y'know this is on the Internet...people can read this..."  I don't think he liked that his name was mentioned so frequently.  He's a big part of my life...I'd start a post last week and then his name would come up...of course...I just ended up deleting the posts.  I feel like I'm at a crossroads...or I guess I would say that I'm approaching one.  I say "approaching" because I've yet to see the road signs that tell me exactly where each road leads; what my choices are.  There's something missing; there's nothing I'm excited about.  People ask me "what's new?" and I don't have an answer for them...just "y'know, work, that sort of thing..."  I need enthusiasm!  Anyways...that's my blurb of the day.  Take care.

      Morning all!  One more day and it's the weekend...yippee!!!!!  It's been a pretty laid back week to say the least.  Tuesday after work, I went up to Ch'town for a bit...hung out with Donovan, then the two of us went over to Dave's for supper. Dave BBQ'd shark and it was delicious!!!! I went to see "my man" for a bit afterwards and then headed to Ruth's for Big Brother and Amazing Race.  Yesterday, Pam (my co-worker) and I went on a "field trip"  We went and hiked a trail near Stanhope because we're working with a community that is thinking of doing something similar.  We also stopped at the Island Preserve Co. on the way back; the owner put in a botanical garden so we took a walk through there.  We were back by about two but instead of going back to work, we each went home and pretended like our trip took all day!  I was poolside by 2:30 and it was HOT!!!!  It started out as a cool and dreary day but ended up being a scorcher.  Last night, I lazed around, went to Wallyworld with Ruth and that was about it.  Today should be a busy one at work.  I have a lot of paperwork to get caught up on.  I'm facilitating a Business Camp in two weeks so I have to start getting things in order for that.  Should be fun though!

       I cannot even begin to describe how fantastic my self-imposed three-day weekend was....but I'll try!!!    &nbsp;   FRIDAY    I spent the night with "my boy" on Thursday night so we were able to wake up together on Friday morning.&nbsp; His alarm went off at 5:30 a.m. because he was supposed to go into work for a couple of hours.&nbsp; He got showered and dressed, we talked...at about 6:30 he called into work to get the scoop on the workload for the morning...turned out, he didn't have to go in anymore... but we were up and awake so we spent the morning drinking coffee...he watched the news and I read a book.&nbsp; Shortly before noon we got up, showered, had a puff, and headed for the Mall.&nbsp; We spent an hour or more wandering the men's department of Winners.&nbsp; He found some cool shirts and we headed home.&nbsp; About 4:30 we headed for Victoria Row, sat at Brennan's, drank beer and had some food...about 7:00 we headed for Baba's..met up with Professor Dave, Donovan and others...It was a good time...beautiful summer day, drinking on patios, good conversations with old friends and new acquaintances.&nbsp; We walked home at ten o'clock, laughing, holding hands and smooching along the way.&nbsp; I soooooooo needed Friday...a day where E and I forgot about work, our lack of cash and other stressors and just enjoyed each other.&nbsp; I feel like we're back on track.    &nbsp;   SATURDAY &amp; SUNDAY    Saturday and Sunday were basically the same...awesome!!!! Both days I was poolside by noon (you should see my tan!!!).&nbsp; I drank ALOT of beers the past few days.&nbsp; Saturday it was Joanne, Jerry, the kids and I.&nbsp; The three adults went to the Deckhouse Saturday night for food and we ended up meeting up with Cam and Lynn which was nice.&nbsp; Yesterday started out quiet and turned into a full fledged pool party.&nbsp; It was awesome!!!!&nbsp; There were about ten of us drinking and tanning and floating etc. by the pool.&nbsp; Let me tell you I slept well last night.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  So yes, a great weekend.&nbsp; Can't wait to hear about everyone else's...    &nbsp;  Now I guess I should get to work....ciao!!!!

      Happy Saturday!  What a gorgeous day!  I was out shopping all morning (birthday presents for Dad, an outfit for me to wear to Cam's wedding, Bacardi Breezers to sip by the pool).  I've spent my quota though and I'll have to watch my pennies until payday on Thursday.  Oh well!  It was fun.  Yesterday was a good day.  I was on the road all day for work.  O'Leary in the morning, an extended lunch break by the pool, Hampshire in the afternoon, and then down to Ch'town to see Ethan.  I got good news yesterday morning...my boss is giving us the civic holiday on Monday so I've got a long weekend!  Woo hoo!  It's supposed to be nice on Monday too so I'll spend the day by the pool.  Yes, so I went to see Ethan last night.  He was hungover from the show the night before...we got some food...and just sort of sat in a daze...it was hotter then hell in his house... at about 7:30 I asked, "would you be offended if I went home?"  It was just soooo hot and I knew I wouldn't sleep so we'd be cranky in our sleep.  He understood, he was tired and probably happy to have the bed to himself....so I went home.  Got back to Summerside to find Joanne, Jerry, Marlene and Jon partying by the pool so I joined them for some cocktails and went to bed about 10:30.   Tonight I've got plans with Julie which should be fun...tomorrow is Dad's birthday...and Monday, like I already said, is by the pool.  I'm going to try to get up to see Ethan some evening too if I can.   Guess what?  This time next weekend I'll be in Hali...yeah!!!!!  Hope you're having great weekends!  Deeds & Amy: how was the show last night?

       Life only demands from you the strength you possess. Only one feat is possible - not to have run away    &nbsp; Well, I'm in a better frame of mind today then I was yesterday...I slept well last night.&nbsp; Amy:&nbsp; did you?  There's a show at Ethan's house tonight...I'm thinking about going...it'd be cool to see some bands, etc.&nbsp; Ethan left me a really cute message last night hoping that I was coming up.&nbsp; That was nice.&nbsp; On the other hand, I have a big day tomorrow and I don't know if I feel like driving up to Ch'town and back tonight when I'm driving all over the Island for work tomorrow.&nbsp; It might be nicer to stay home and watch Canadian Idol and Big Brother.&nbsp; Decisions, decisions.  Not much to say today.&nbsp; 8 sleeps and I go to Hali!

        The pendulum of the mind alternates between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong.    I read that quote today and it struck a chord so I thought I would post it.   New look for my blog today. I went to do a post and I just didn't feel like writing on a green screen. I didn't sleep well last night and I woke up with a headache...I'm feeling pretty pissy today. This template is called "dark dots"...I'm feeling a bit dark today so I thought it would suffice.   Today, I could have totally used a mental health day rather then coming into work. I think I could have laid in bed all day today. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a mental health day in the perfect Parnham residence... that being said, something is not right in the world of Cricki...Did I mention I'm how excited I am to be going to Halifax next weekend. That right there might do the trick! I need to get off this Island...aaaaaarrrrrgggghhhh!   Anyways, it appears that this morning my "pendulum" is swinging more to the nonsense side of things...I'll quit my rambling and start my work.    xxxooo

      Good Morning!  Did everyone have a good weekend?  Mine was pretty good.  Friday afternoon, I got off work a little early and headed for the beach...I was finally in the ocean for the first time this summer!  Surprisingly, it wasn't that cold.  It was windy as HELL though.  I showered at Ethan's once I got back and even after showering I could still feel grains of sand in my hair.  Friday night I had a few drinks and went to Baba's.  There wasn't much going on there and I was a little "frizzle-frazzled" so I just kinda sat there in a daze.  Saturday, I slept in until 1:30!!!  I couldn't believe it!  Took the dog for a walk, then hung around Ch'town until "my boy" got off work and we had supper.  Headed back to Summerside Saturday night and got a good night's sleep.  Sunday morning was started off with Coronation Street, of course!  Although Corrie isn't half as fun to watch by myself.  Watching it with Ethan, or Shelley, would be more exciting.  I worked a little bit yesterday and hung out with Ruth...this morning I just came in for a bit to talk to my boss and now I'm heading to Ch'town to pick up Ethan and head to the beach.  Can't wait!  Hope you all are able to enjoy the day...

      Sorry for the lack of giggles and childish levity today. I was kinda bummed that I couldn't go to Halifax. I did try to post my disappointment earlier in the morning but blogger kept screwing up. It's the end of the day and I'm pooped. If I was going to Halifax I would probably have a whole lot more energy. Instead, I feel like I could sleep for two days.  I'm not sure what I'll get up to this weekend...I'll stay positive...but know that I'll be wishing I was in Halifax!  **********************************  "Your body is not a temple, it's an amusement park.

      I don't even know what to say today...I'm really disappointed that I'm not going to Halifax... I am trying to find the positive...that I'll see Amy and Nadine at Cam's wedding, etc...but it just sucks...this whole weekend is going to suck...I won't be in Hali, Ethan works, there are a couple of things going on here but I don't have any money...mother f*cker...

      So I'm not going to Halifax today...car issues...resulting expenses which ate up my Halifax travel fund.  I'm trying to find the positive in all of this...it's hard.  I tell myself: a)  at least you could afford to pay for most of it by yourself Christi... b)  Amy and Nadine will be over soon for Cam's wedding Christi...  Big freakin' whoop...I wanted to come over this weekend.  There are things going on on PEI this weekend too...Julie Clow's birthday today but I can't afford to go out...Irving & Denise's wedding tomorrow (once again...lack of funds).  AND it's going to rain so I can't even veg by the pool...Ethan works...so I'll be holed up in Scummerside thinking of Hali.

      One more sleep and I'm going to Hali!!!!  Today will be a good day...I'm leaving shortly and I'll be on the road all day.  Out to Rustico, into Summerside to look for some prizes for the kids, a site visit in Kinkora, into Ch'town for some work stuff, then I'm going to see Ethan since I won't see him all weekend.  Not so bad since he works every weekend anyways and this weekend he's working extra hours.  So today will go by fast but I have a feeling that tomorrow will DRAG as I anticipate getting to Halifax with my girls.  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  Talk to you soon!

      Wednesday...Hump Day...I'd prefer to be in bed.  I stayed up last night to watch Big Brother and Amazing Race....by the time they were over I had a pounding headache and I'm still suffering the aftermath this morning.  The headache is barely there but the whole right side of my neck is sore and stiff as hell.  I look like a robot today if I have to turn my head for anything...at least my desk chair swivels.  Anywho, not much to say today.  TTFN  p.s.  Two more sleeps till I'm in Hali!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Soooooo tired and hungover....  Well, yesterday was a great day.  I was poolside by 11:00 a.m. and didn't leave the deck until about four when Julie and I went for a drive out to the Frosty Treat.  I didn't even get that burnt; hardly at all actually but my tan is deepening.  Julie and I had a great afternoon in the pool trying out all the different toys and making arses of our self.  It was fun.  Ruth stopped by this relentless string of night shifts she on is really f*cking with her system.  I went down to Ch'town last night.  Good times...  I feel myself always on edge now when I walk into Ethan's place.  Usually one of us is in some type of "mood" when we see each other but we both had yesterday off so we were in fine spirits.  We went to the Churchill Arms for supper...had a pitcher of beer gone before our food came...another pitcher for with our meal...and another pitcher for conversations sak!  Got home, did a couple of "toot-too-too-loo-toots" and giggled myself to sleep.  (Sigh)  I hated to leave this morning...but work calls and three sleeps from now I'll be in Hali...and then on the 9, 10, and 11, Adam will be on PEI so I can't be slacking off right now!  Anyways, I best get to work...I think the only way I'll survive today is if I keep very busy!  TTFN

       It's gonna be a scorcher!  It's 9:30 a.m.....I plan to write this post, get dressed, go for a walk, and be poolside by 11:30...yippee!  I think Julie and Ruth are coming by today.  That should be fun.  Wish the rest of my girls could be here.      I just had a really sweet e-mail from Dave, in Calgary.  I had an e-mail from him out of the blue not too long ago...a four-liner asking how I was doing and saying that his new girlfriend was "great."  I got the impression that he was only e-mailing me to let me know that he had a girlfriend.  We haven't talked in months; I kinda ended that one night when he kept making comments that I wasn't serious about Ethan, that he knew if there was a way we could be together that I would do it.  I told him that I cared about Ethan and didn't appreciate his comments.  Things kinda died off from there.  Anywho, I e-mailed him back saying "wow, this girl must be pretty special if you're actually mentioning her to me..."  Turns out they've been together six months...she's a total sweetheart, etc.  Blechh!!!  No, not really...just a slight twinge of jealousy.  BUT since he has a girlfriend now and, for the time being, I still have Ethan...we've been able to e-mail back and forth once or twice a week about normal things, which is nice... the thing with Dave is he's the guy that I would say listened to me the most out of any guy I've ever been linked too.  He knows everything about me and it's so nice to hear him ask about all my girls, Nadine's wedding, my Dad's health, etc. because he's interested and not because he feels those are the right questions to ask.      Anywho, that's my blurb of the day...take care

        The other night I dreamt I met the man of my dreams...     I thought of Nadine when I "met" him....     I remember her always saying "just find a geeky guy that will worship that floor you walk on"     This guy was some sort of computer whiz...     Cute in a geeky sort of way; curly brown hair, glasses...     I was so happy in my sleep...     I would wake up smiling in the night, only to be met with the realization that "he" wasn't real.     I wish I could be as happy in my waking life as I was in that dream...          *******************************************************************
