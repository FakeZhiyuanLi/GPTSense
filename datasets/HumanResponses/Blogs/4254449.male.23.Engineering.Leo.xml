      What am I passionate about? That is the question that has been plaguing my thoughts for the last several hours. However, this simple fact is that I am unsure where my true passion lies. I keep asking myself the same questions over and over in desperate hope that an answer will come to me from within the folds of my mind. Yet when I dig deeper all I find are more questions. Am I passionate about my career choice, yes I am. I love computer programming more and more every day. I love to sit down with a problem aid out in front of me and finding a way to solve said problem in a logical and systematic manner. I still feel as though I'm missing something.  Until I figure out what it is that I am missing however, I will still be me. I'll keep on doing what I do till I find something better. I suppose that's all I can ever really ask for, the chance to continue on, move forward, and become a better person.

      Why is it that people are your friend only when it suits them. I have had many experiences in my life where I have thought my friends were "there for me", however when it really counted only a precious few remained. It seems to me that there are two types of people in this world, one type being self centered, egotistical, tyrannical assholes....And the other type normal, sweet-hearted, kind people.  For example, last Friday evening my "friend" went screaming through his apartment yelling that I was not allowed to use the restroom because he couldn't stand the end result. And he accually used the words:   "He is NOT allowed to use the bathroom ever, and I mean EVER."   I let it roll off my back then, however thinking back, I am furious. Not only is that degrading and insulting to me, but my feelings never even crossed his mind. The only thing he was concerned with was his discomfort.  And then of course there is the other type, the ones when it all comes down to it, truly make a difference in people's lives. Unfortunately, they are all to few, and as I do count myself among their numbers. (and there are numerous people who would say the same thing) . At the end of the day, I find it a bit sad and somewhat troubling that I associate myself with those "friends" that can't see far enough past their own selfishness to realize how their actions have consequences upon other people.  So to that end, from now on I have vowed to not let such actions go beyond my notice. If I see such transactions occur, either upon myself or someone I care for, I shall be heard.  I will not allow such atrocities to go unnoticed any longer. Pray you are not one to transgress in my presence, for my retribution will be swift and unwavering with a fury the likes of which God has never borne witness.
