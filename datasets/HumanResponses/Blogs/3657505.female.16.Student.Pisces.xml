      Aargh!  How many things do I need to drop/break/rip/spill today before I officially become the worlds most clumsy person?  This has been a bad day, a very bad day, one of those days you look back and go "Glad I'm not her".  I would tell the whole story, but to tell you the truth, I'm really, really tired and can't be bothered with the typing and the emotions and the thinking of different intteligent sounding descriptive words to litter my post with.  I honestly think this all comes down to tiredness. I haven't had a full proper nights sleep in about... uh... nine days. My problem seems to be going to bed too late. Saturday night is usually my saviour. The one day I know I will get that full nights sleep. Alas, I had to wake up really early on the Sunday to get to a gig, to que outside to get a good view. Thus, my sleeping was disturbed.  I'm tired, I'm emotionally tired and physically tired. Is it just me or does anyone else feel offended when they get told "You look tired" or "You look ill".   Whoah. That yawn could have swallowed my whole face there! I have to go and rest my eyes. To conclude, I'm clumsy because I'm tired. I'm tired because it's my own fault I don't go to bed early enough.  Thank you, and good night

      Doesn't it suck when that guy you like but got over comes in looking really, really good and turns you into nothing more than a crap talking mess?  Well, guess what, it happened to me today. Let me tell you the story, for the purpose of this I will give everyone code names.  So, start of a new year, and you sit down in the classroom. First lesson is so completely boring you think your going to kill yourself or more than likely, drop the class. Next lesson, a guy you know but don't really know, we'll call him "Joe", sits in the only empty seat in the class, which just so happens to be right beside you. Suddenly you start talking, and over the year this guy becomes a ray of shining light in a once boring class. You become friends, best friends almost. But of course, you being female, and a teenager, you start to get a crush on Joe. Because Joe is good looking, and funny, and pretty much the right guy for you. So anyway, over time this crush grows. Until it reaches the stage where you go "Crap, I could ask him out, but if he says no then I'll lose one of my best friends..."  Thus leaving you in a catch-22. And catch-22's aren't fun.   This story has no ending, no happy conclusion. Just a puzzle. One that has yet to be solved. Any help and comments are greatly appreciated.

      Wow, I actually signed up for this thing, after months of going "I really should make a blog, and then people can read about all the adventures I get up to, wait, I don't get up to adventures. I'll just leave it."  Anyway, it'll take me a while to get used to this thing. I'll post again later, when I figure out what to do...
