        Band camp is finally over! woo woo! Being with band people 12 hours for 6 days is just too much. It makes you realize how annoying some people really are. I dunno whats up with girls nowa days but they seem to think that acting like you're a ditzy blonde is cute.Well it's NOT- it's incredibly stupid and annoying! What do they want people to believe- that they can't think for themselves? Oh and what gets me is that some guys actually hang around these girls. Personally i'd rather slap the chick and tell her to stop faking it. And the clothes some girls wear- my goodness they are so sleasy! With their little booty shorts and low tight shirts. Its just nasty nobody wants to see that. What ever happened to having a lil decentcy and actually wearing something that covers you up? You don't have to dress sleasily for people to like you and if u do- well then your prob not a very fun person to be around anyways.       &nbsp;   Sorry this is one of my more "angry" posts- i usually don't like writing them but this is something that will make the world a better place! haha

        Hiccups are the funniest thing! Your just minding your own business and WHAM they hit ya! And boy do they hit hard! Oh and theres no way to get rid of them! That holding your breath thing or drinking out of a cup upside down- they don't work! What is a hiccup anyway? And have you noticed they come in the most inconvienent times? Like during the prayer at church or while your trying to eat. It's like its a planned thing!

        I was just wondering why old people look like they do. I mean when your little as you get older you generally loose the cuteness but u still look good (for most people). So at what age do&nbsp;you start declining and looking saggy and shriveled? It just kinda happens! One day you're cute the next day your shriveled! And how does it happen!? Why do we look worse when we get older? Why isn't it the other way around? Sigh- I guess I'll hafta add it to my "Ask God" list.

        For the past hour I have had about a million songs stuck in my head! A song will pop into my head and i'll just start belting it out. And its weird songs too like that retro stuff and old foggie kinda songs. It ranges from  Oops I did it again  to    Oh Danny Boy  to  I'll Fly Away!  It's crazy and kinda disturbing... Oh and when I'm talkin to myself if I don't watch it I'll start singing what i just said makin up my own song. It's not normal! I mean I can understand talking to yourself but coming up with songs about the conversations with yourself.... well thats just plum&nbsp;scary!

        This post is dedicated to all you troubled teens. Going out with people is supposed to be fun NOT mushy gushy serious weird stuff. So heres my theory which a friend helped my write:        &nbsp;   What people now days call "going out" means that you claim eachother and are temporarily stuck to somebody for usually a long period of time in which u probally decide you don't even like this person BUT you don't want to break things off because it would be too much of a mess. So going out is basically a pointless, rather stupid thing that ends in a mess. Dating, however, is so much better! When you date, you're not really making a commitment you're just having fun. And then if you decide you don't like the person then you just don't answer their calls and you move on! Man I give good advice!       &nbsp;     &nbsp;   On the dating subject- as I was goin to bed last night I was thinking about what kinda guy would be right for me and i came up with a list of some things i like in a guy and some things&nbsp;I don't like! So here it is:       &nbsp;   Top 5 things I like in a guy       &nbsp;   1.Funny! I'm a happy person I like to laugh!     2.Respectful to parents and to me     3.Christian or just an all around good guy     4.Nice hair and pretty eyes- oh and they hafta smell good!     5. and a country boy preferably or an austrailian accent!       &nbsp;   oo ok when u comment gimme your list of things u like in a girl or guy!

        Dedicated with love&nbsp;to my dear friend Harry, Toddles, Ddot, and Todd.       &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;   While i was trying to come up with my blog title i received many suggestions. Some like "ROAR" I felt were too angry for my happy life. Others, like "Smiley" I felt were, well, a bit too  hippieish  for my liking. One, however, i liked very much- "I Like Big Butts". But... I was afraid some of you "more serious people of the world" wouldn't exactly find the humor in it or get the joke. So I had to turn it down. However I appreciate the suggestion and the thought that went into it. So have a funny day!      Live a Little!         &nbsp;

        Well it's Friday night, just finished watching Welcome to Mooseport- hahah- and I'm in one of those bored hyper kinda moods. Soo I decided to write in my blog since I havn't done it in what- 10 days?.  Anyways this is gonna be one of those kinda pointless but very intresting posts, since of course, everything in my blog is so very intresting! Well school is just fabulous. I have to pass off a peice of music which by the way i can't play- oh and english is the perfect time to catch up on missed sleep! hahah! The great thing is I sit on the front row and sleep and mrs. Lashley doesn't even care! Care class- woo woo- character and realationship education (sex ed) man thats a weird class! Hmm I wanna go somewhere cuz im hyper but i guess i can't seeing as its 10:30 at night and i can't drive. I'm very random tonight. I want some glasses. I have contacts but i think i want some small glasses i can wear in public so i look sophisticated! Ohh a few days ago in biology we had this really hard question for extra credit on our test and since it was an honors class i didn't figure i'd have a chance at it anyways so i just kinda started writing things down, but then it started makin sense and i got it right. Haha i think i made everyone feel stupid cuz the "dumb kid" got it! hahah it was great. I was so proud of myself! Ugg im soo hyper and theres nothing to do and no where to go!!! *sigh* I think i needa boy friend... I'm kinda tired of being single. But the problem is i havn't found anybody to like that i know likes me, and i gotta know they like me cuz i don't like takin chances on people. I'm so difficult. Wow it was kinda cold today! But thats ok i like it cold cuz i like to sleep under 3 or 4 blankets at night! I'm soo weird- haha o well its more fun that way! Popular people are so much fun to make fun of! Cuz they r so worried about lookin good and hanging out with the most popular people when in high school it doesn't really matter as long as u have a group to be with! Well those are my sophisticated thoughts of the night since I think im coming down off of my hyper- high!

        School- it's just so wonderful. I just love being a freshy and being bossed around by the more "expierenced" hoodlums! Oh and i've decided we should have big signs tellin which way the classes are! I got lost soo many times and I just loved walkin round with a map shoved in my face like a geek! hahahah! Oh and u ask people where things are and they tell u take a right past the gym. I dunno where the gym is! I'm a band geek- come on! But hey i didn't get trashed or trip and fall on my face so I guess it's a good day!
