						   I've placed you in my virtual shopping basket.  Do I dare press the Checkout button?  You cost $400, but I think you may be worth every penny to me.  I've never seen or heard you in person, but your picture looks beautiful, and your sound samples are sweet as morning rain.  Until a few days ago, I didn't even know you existed.  But now I cannot picture myself without you.  Yes, I think I'm commited enough to press that button.  Wait a minute, no free shipping?  Dammit!  What the hell, you only weigh 3 pounds, and they don't ship you free?  Well, I suppose I can spend the extra $9.37 to get you shipped to my doorstep.  And then we will sing together into the night, and I shall play that cool part at the end of ELP's Lucky Man over and over again...

						   A few days ago Lucas announced the title of the final chapter:&nbsp; Revenge of the Sith.&nbsp; Cool title.&nbsp; Just hope the movie itself is cool.&nbsp; He'd better not put any more love story stuff in this one.&nbsp; The 'love dialogue' in that last one made me gag.&nbsp; I seriously could barely watch those scenes.&nbsp; Did he just watch some crappy daytime soap operas and steal random lines from those?&nbsp; Fortunately, he has a chance to redeem himself with this last one.&nbsp; Hopefully he focuses on violence and death and destruction.&nbsp; Then the movie will be totally bitch.&nbsp; And I've heard that Chewbacca will make an appearance in this last one...sweet!!!&nbsp; Although, if Lucas really wants to make everyone happy, he should do this:&nbsp; have a scene where Chewbacca meets Jar Jar, and they sit down to a nice friendly game of Hologram Space Chess, like they played in&nbsp;A New Hope.&nbsp; Then, have Jar Jar win the game.&nbsp; Then, have Chewbacca rip Jar Jar's arms out of their sockets!!&nbsp; Wookies have been known to do that.&nbsp; Can you imagine the crowd's response to a scene like that?!&nbsp; I think everyone would forgive Lucas for his past transgressions if he put that scene in the new movie.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if its too late to email Lucas with my idea?

						   Yeah that's right.&nbsp; I've been informed that my yearly allocation of vacation days has been bumped from ten per year up to fifteen.&nbsp; That's some sweet action!&nbsp; Even though I rarely use them.&nbsp; I have something like twenty days saved up already.&nbsp; &nbsp;I suppose I should make more use of them, like take a day off and volunteer at a retirement home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or take off a day and just play computer games the whole time.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I like that second option much more.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to hone my computer gaming abilities.&nbsp; That's how you get all the chicks.&nbsp; They certainly appreciate a man who has mad PC gaming skills.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I'll just take a sick day instead, that way I can keep my vacation days.&nbsp; Then I'll have even more vacation days that will go unused.&nbsp;&nbsp; Man, I'm starting to feel ill, I don't know if I'll be in tomorrow.&nbsp; I think it was some bad egg salad.&nbsp; Something's not sitting right...

						   I need to stop obsessing over effects pedals.&nbsp; I've spent like $300 on new ones in last month alone.&nbsp; I should really just focus on playing and&nbsp;writing some songs instead of getting another shiny box that makes me sound fuzzy.&nbsp;&nbsp;   But I love those little boxes.&nbsp; They're so cute, and fill me with a sense of well being.&nbsp; And they look totally bitch sitting on my floor in front of my amp.&nbsp; Okay, maybe I'll just buy one more.&nbsp; That Jekyll and Hyde one looks pretty sweet.&nbsp; Those dudes from the Strokes use it.&nbsp; And they probably score like all the time.&nbsp; Ooh, its only $100 online right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, I think I might need that.&nbsp; Free shipping?&nbsp; Ooh mama.&nbsp; I totally need.&nbsp;

						   I think I've reached the breaking point.&nbsp; I've listened to&nbsp;Ramble On one&nbsp;too many times.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need a break.&nbsp; I really need to bring some other&nbsp;MP3s&nbsp;to work.&nbsp; Okay, maybe I'll just turn off the Zep for a few minutes.....   ....Ah, that's better.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I can hear myself think.&nbsp; No more&nbsp;wailing guitars and thunderous drums.&nbsp; I can hear the delicate typing of my neighboring cube monkeys.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I can hear their inane phone conversations.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I can hear their cell phone rings going off, playing that stupid Evanescence song for the 234th time...   ...Man, I really need to drown this stuff out, or I'll go insane.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmmm,&nbsp;maybe I'll just crank a little&nbsp;Custard Pie&nbsp;for a while, I haven't listened to that track in a few hours.&nbsp; Okay, that's better.&nbsp; Man, I really need to encode some new MP3s.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though they totally rule, there's only so much Zep I can take...

						   They make low carb dog food now.&nbsp;&nbsp; And low carb bread.&nbsp;&nbsp; And low carb powdered sugar.&nbsp; People have officially gone insane.&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, I don't see the low carb trend making a dent in the nation's obesity epidemic.&nbsp; I'm willing to wager than in five years time, it will only be worse.&nbsp; And it wouldn't surprise me if, having already gone through low-fat and low-carb crazes, the nation will suddenly embrace a low-protein diet.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we will see insane&nbsp;food products flooding&nbsp;the&nbsp;market, such as low&nbsp;protein sirloin steak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, I think people will run out of diet options, and will be forced to eat things that have no fat, protein, or carbs at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like beeswax.&nbsp; The beeswax diet.&nbsp; That will be the diet trend of 2010.&nbsp; I should start writing a diet book about it right now.&nbsp; Then I could make some serious money, like that Atkins guy.&nbsp; Then I could buy my own personal robot butler.&nbsp; And he could cook me up some tasty bacon and other assorted pork products.

						   I don't think most ladies I've met recently really appreciate a deranged sense of humor.&nbsp; That's truly a shame.&nbsp; Who wants to laugh at normal things?&nbsp; Life is so much better when its unpredictable and random.&nbsp;&nbsp; And bizarre.&nbsp; And filled with killer robots selling life insurance policies to underage cab drivers.

						   I think I should get a banjo. Even though I don't listen to country or bluegrass. But still, I think I'd enjoy pickin' on a banjo whilst sitting on my front porch. That would certainly creep out my neighbors, since I live in a conservative white upper middle class yuppie neighborhood. I'd have to learn that Dueling Banjos song from Deliverance. Ooh, I could also learn the theme song from Dukes of Hazzard. That would be pretty sweet. Daisy Duke would surely be impressed...

						   The best part of my day is late afternoon at work, when I start thinking about all the things I won't be doing when I get home. I won't be cutting the grass. I won't be paying bills. I won't be vacuuming. I won't be going out on a date with a beautiful woman. I will simply lay down on the couch, turn on my DirecTV, and chill out for the entire evening. Perhaps I will watch the Cards dominate the Reds this evening. Maybe I will get up from the couch to insert a DVD into my player. Hmmm, I need to watch the rest of Aqua Teen Hunger Force Volume 2 Disc 1. God, I love doing nothing important with my life.  I totally rule.

						   Since acquiring my new microKorg keyboard last week, I've gained a new appreciation for electronica, techno, trance and all of the other forms of modern dance music. I now realize that one can create this type of music with little or no musical talent whatsoever. That's right! If you own a keyboard like the microKorg, you can simply press a few keys, tweak a few knobs, and viola - instant techno! I'm never been a big fan of electronic dance music, and now I have even less respect for it than before. Even a no talent ass-clown like Michael Bolton could create a generic trance track and have all of the little ecstasy-addled teenyboppers dancing the night into oblivion!

						   I know why I'm obsessed with sitars. The distinctive sound is closely associated with the psychedelic rock period of the late '60s, which in my mind is the greatest era in the history of rock music. And ever since I plucked the strings of a sitar sitting in the corner of Music Folk (it was the lovely year of 1997), I've wanted a sitar of my very own. But getting a good sitar is no easy task. A quality one costs well over $1000, which in my student days was an insane amount of cash. Then there's the issue of finding one. The ones they carried at Music Folk were crappy entry-level student models. So I'd have to order one online if I really wanted one. But recently I've discovered an intriguing alternative: the electric sitar! Yes, it's basically a guitar that has been made to sound buzzy like a sitar. And it turns out that many of those classic recordings from the '60s actually used an electric sitar rather than a real one. So, I've now become quite fixated on acquiring one of these instruments. There are 3 options: one, find an old original Danelectro electric sitar on eBay (good luck with allll that!); two, buy a Rogue brand replica from Musicians Friend for $300 (supposedly they are pretty junky); three, buy a Jerry Jones handmade replica for $700 (bingo!). Yes, I totally need a Jerry Jones electric sitar. That would be soooooo sweet! Eddie's Guitars has one in stock. I must go there this week and try it out. And after I acquire such an instrument, I may wake in the early morning to improvise my own ragas in their electrified glory.

						   Does talking in rhymes over generated beats consistute music?  I suppose it does, but just barely in my book.  I've tried listening to some of the 'good' rap music out there, and although I could listen to it for extended periods without turning it off, I just couldn't get in to it.  First off, I need to have some real instruments in my music - real guitars, real drums, real bass.  When all of the music is generated by digital means, it really sounds cold and lifeless to my ears (I guess that's why I dislike most pop music of the '80s, too).  Second, I dislike the fact there isn't a vocal melody to wrap my ears around (try whistling the 'melody' to a 50 Cent or Chingy song - it can't be done!).  Finally, I really can't relate to the lyrics of most rap artists.   I grew up in a upper-middle class suburb, so I can't say I know much about pimps, hos, or popping caps into a brother's ass.   Where's my Figure 8 CD at?  Ah, there it is...much better...

						   Why did I buy this bag of pork rinds? I try to eat healthy foods, but for some reason I was compelled to buy a bag of them while at the gas station. The whole concept is quite disgusting - who originated the idea in the first place? They must have been starving or something.  Yet, at the same time, I can't stop eating them this afternoon.  I should just throw away the remaining skins.  No!  I cannot resist their crunchy, weird tastiness!  I need to try those salt and vinegar ones next time.  I bet those are really tasty.  And they are Atkins approved.  Which means that you can eat as many of them as you want, and live a long heathly life - right?
