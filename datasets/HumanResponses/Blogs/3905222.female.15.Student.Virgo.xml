       Today normal friday... but i wake up early to study for stupid A-maths test and now very tired. Today as normal went to school. What brighten up the day is the thinking of visiting the band, clarinet and my juniors after school. Today got geography lesson and we are suppose to hand in an assignment. Last night i spend about one hour doing the assignment haiZ... but when i go school after i lend my work to a friend i cannot find it back. but i guess it should be with my friend but she never notice she took it. I never blame her but i wish she return it to me tomorrow so i can hand it up. HaiZ... but whenever i think of band it will brighten me up. Today Mr Lim was to pass the CDs from Mr Chong to me. Mr Chong help me to burn all the pictures he taken in our school band and also give me the music exchange VCD.. wah so happy ya know.. now i can enjoy looking at those pictures and listen to our band play the songs... haha those pictures are so funny leh.. he also give me some of the pictures of himself haha... ^-^

       Today as normal I&nbsp;went to school. First and second lesson was biology but when it was third period which was maths lesson, Mdm Ng told us that we have to go to the music room as&nbsp;Mr Nathan have something serious to tell us. When most of us thought that Mr Nathan wanted us to sing nation anthem or talk to us but never did we expect that Mrs Chua broke the news that one of my classmate passed away. At that moment everyone quiet down. We were shock and I don't believe what I heard. I even ask Jia ying to confirm it. Then most of the girls started crying. And of course I cried. She was&nbsp;in the same English&nbsp;class as me and we were sitting next to each other. Although we were not that close, we do talk during english class. She was a very good girl although her results are not that good. She was dead on the 19 July 2004. We stay in the music room whole day without having lesson until the end of the school. So sad..... T_T
