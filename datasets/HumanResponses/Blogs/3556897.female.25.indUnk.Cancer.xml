       Introdction  In the next comming 40 days i will place my answers and thoughts each chapter Rick Warrens book gives. The thoughts and opinions are my thoughts and opinions.This i do to share with you my points of view. And have some discussions and interchanging thoughts. His with a goal to find out Gods purpose that He gave to me. And to grow as a Christian.  From each chapter i will take sentences that does something or say something to me. And then i placed the point to ponder, a verse to remember and the question to consider below each other. This followed by my thoughts and answers. Sometimes it happens that i also have negative thoughts. So that in all openess and fairness, you can see dear reader what it does with me. And maybe something does with you.  Be free to add comments.   Thank you.      The Purpose Driven Life.  By Rick Warren .  40 days of finding out Gods purpose for my life.    It all starts with God .  Day 1 (Chapter 1).  “You were made for God, not vice versa, and life is about letting God use you for his purposes, not your using him for your own purpose.”  “This is not a self-help book. It is not about finding the right career, achieving your dreams, or planning your life. It is not about how to cram more activities into an overloaded schedule. Actually, it will teach you how to do less in life – by focusing on what matters most. It is about becoming what God created you to be.”  “The same is true for discovering your life’s purpose: Ask God.”  “You may have felt in the dark about your purpose in life. Congratulations, you’re about to walk into the light.”    Day One Thinking about my purpose.    Point to ponder:  It’s not about me.  Positive thoughts:   Its hard not to think self centred. I did that all my life and maybe still do most of the time. But its true when the Bible says that God had, before I even was born, an eye on me. Even before I knew about God’s excistance. Why am I convinced in that? Because God already had His plan for me and eyes on me. He gave me a purpose in life. Its now up to me to find with Gods help, this in any way, Gods purpose for my life He gave me. Therefor its not about me. But its way beyond me. Way outside me. God only knows.   Negative thoughts:  Rick Warren only wants to put words in my mouth. Want to change me like he would like to see. He claims to be a man of God. But doesn’t he act like God. Giving me directions in what to think. And where to go.   Change of negative thoughts:   But then again. Its not about me. And also not about Rick Warren the author of this book. Its about Gods plan. The purpose of my life given by God. Maybe Rick Warren tries to help finding our way in finding our purpose in life. Any answer and any thought is ok. As long as I am honest wholeheartedly. Lets see where this book leads too.   Verse to Remember:  “Everything got started in him and finds its purpose in him.” Colossians 1:16b (Msg).   Question to Consider:   In spite of all advertising around me, how can I remind myself that life is really about living for God, not myself?  Answer:   It is a good question. Indeed I love advertisements. Especially those with the latest gadgets, from mobile phones to computers and so on. This advertising is distracting me from struggles in live, worries and sad things that are going on in my life. Making me long for some materialistic needs and make me set goals in reaching that materialistic dream or dreams. Als distracting me that my life is really about living for God and not myself. The second part of the question made me think about how I could remind myself that life is really about living for God and not for myself. To be honest. I don’t have a clue. Make a token on the wall? The Bible laying on top of the table in the livingroom? A silver chain with a silver cross around my neck? There’s only one thing I can do. And that is ask God. By starting praying. I think that praying everyday makes me remind that life is living for God and not myself. And when I pray, I just know I can tell God and ask God everything even be angry at God because I don’t understand what he is doing with me in my life. Maybe. Just maybe he is telling me by making it hard for me. That life indeed is not about myself but living for God.

      The Purpose Driven LIfe. A book written by Rick Warren.  Soon i will start to read this book. And i wonder what it will do in my life. But above all how it would affect through me others as well.  This book has a 40 days plan. Where you can find out what your purpose of your life is on the face of this planet. We are all seem to look for the question: Why are we here for? Because we all have to leave this planet one day as well. Making room for others. The circle of nature.  To be honest. I'm a little afraid. Because everything new makes me feel uncertain. Like walking on a new path and your destiny is unknown yet. Only when you arrive you know. No sooner. No later. But on the other hand i tell myself not to be afraid or worrying about it. Because its the eye of the beholder if you see that path like a dark scary alley or path in a dark and scary forrest. Or see the path as a new adventure. Where you can see and encounter new and great things. I choose for the last. The new and great things. Facing it with a certain curiosity. And in one palm of my hand the fear. Without letting the fear and worries leading my way.  I make a small promise here.  When i start with the 40 days plan of Rick Warrens Purpose Driven Life. I'll let you know what every chapter does with me. Share my feelings. My questions. My surprises, realisations and my personal discoveries.   And let me know what you think about it.  I thank my wife for bringing me on that idea.   With all my heart i love her.

      Like everyone in the world, i have manny dreams. Dreams gives us hope for a better future. A better future for myself. But also a better future for others. For my sweet and caring wife, for close relatives, etc. Some dreams stay dreams. Others will be fullfilled. Some by hard work. Some by others who like to fullfill one or two of your dreams.  Dreams make us feel alive. And keep us focussed to fullfill those dreams. This with both feet steady on the ground. But can also make us float.  The stronger a dream is. The stronger the longing and the need is to make that dream come true.  I dream of being succesful in overcomming my biggest worries and fears. I dream of my wife.  I dream of having an own house where our children grow up in relative safety and in harmony. Where our children see and feel that their parents love them and care for them. But also see that their parents love and care for each other.  I dream....

           The Purpose Driven Life           By Rick Warren                              <>          What Drives Your Life?          <>       “ Guilt-driven people are manipulated by memories. They allow their past to control their future. They often uncoinsiously punsih themselves by sabotaging their own succes.”          “We are products of our past, but we don’t have to be prisoners of it.”         “The Bible says,    “To worry yourself to death with resentment would be a foolish, senseless thing to  do.”     <>       <>   “Fear is a self-imposed prison that will keep you from becoming what God intends for you to be. You  must  move against it with the weapons of faith and love.”         <>       “Real security can only be found in that wich can never be taken from you – your relatiosnhip with God.”          “Without a purpose, life is motion without meaning, activity without direction, and events without reason. Without purpose, life is trivial, petty and pointless.”          <>        The Benefits of Purpose-Driven Living.           “Knowing your purpose gives meaning t your life.”     <>   “Knowing your purpose simplifies your life.”          “Without a clear purpose you have no foundation on wich you base decisions, allocate time, and use your resources.”     <> “Knowing your purpose focuses your life.”         <>       “Knowing your purpose motivates your life.”           “Knowing your purpose prepares you for eternity.”               Day Three.           Thinking about my purpose.                       Point to ponder:    Living on purpose is the path to peace.          Thoughts:   When I would know my purpose on the face of this world. I would finally have found a way of living in peace without fear but with faith. Also with a lot of focus and motivation. Plus I then know what path to walk on. And finnaly don’t need to wander around looking for a better life. Because a better life starts with a purpose.                    Verse to remember:    “You Lord, give perfect peace to those who keep their purpose firm and put their trust in you.” Isaiah 26:3 (TEV)                    Question to consider:    What would my family and friends say is the driving force of my life? What do I want it to be?          Answer:    I think, but are not yet sure, that my driving force would be care. That’s what family and friends would say. Even when I sometimes be selfish or uncertain. When knowing my family and friends. They would tell that. Care without judging people. Even when I sometimes judge people. When help needed I will be there for them. This so that they accept me as I am. And love me and care for me as well when time is there for doing so. Its of course up to them if they want to care back as well.          What do I want it to be? I want it to be care as well. But then without those many fears that uncertainty brings along side with it. Just simply believe and act without acting that I care.
