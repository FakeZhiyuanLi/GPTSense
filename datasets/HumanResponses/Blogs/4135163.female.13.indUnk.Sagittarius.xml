      My Dad is writing a book on WW2 veterans but now, I think its turning. The war in Iraq, has anyone watched the news lately? It is unbelieveable and wut else is unbelieveable is that they show wut is really going on in Iraq at 11:00 at night!!! I hate how our government and the economy works it is so dumb and really weird how they have to cover up for everything and make everything all seceret. And why is it that so many people are against Bush and they are more of them then the government, then why won't we take a stand? Is there something wrong with these people? Why can't we just do something about this and take a stand insted of standing back and watching it all happen. I hate how some people just don't do anything and they stand back and watch it happen when they know what is going on but they won't take a stand and prov what is right. I hate the fact that some people just say that they can do things that they think are right but deep down they know that they are wrong. Tonight my Dad showed me something that he wrote and I was very proud that he was my dad, because it mad sense and if he should it to someone from the gov or maybe even the president, I bet u it would definitly make a difference. Because thats what my dad was set out to do, make a difference. And his dad would be so proud of him right now that he was set to do this and this is him and this is his destiny. My dad being the kind of guy that he is was ment to do something and he is now, writing his book getting his point out and I am very proud that he is doing this because it is telling people that there is hope in the world and that they shoud not give up and that they should never think wut other people think only think wut u think and express ur opinion and wut u think only. Agreeing with people is one thing but copying them and thinking they think because u r unsure is wrong so be un sure just as long as u r u and u r staying u.

      Its not easy, falling in love, out of love, and then back in love. It is was one big complacted song that at some point we have all sung and are sometimes at heart tierd of singing. I messed up and tonight someone made me relize that it is not right to care about what other people think because it is wrong half the time and sometimes all the time. You should only think what you think is right and never what anyone else thinks because you are you and no one else is. So go home and call up your own shopping buddy that got lost with all your new friends moving and in and out of your life but didn't really matter cause that one person that did you think is gone, but really there are not they are a good person and they are sitting there waiting for you to come back because they new you would. Thats true and if you sit and talk to them and just spend time with them, they will see that you are telling the truth because sometimes your friends know you, better then you know yourself. Thank you so much! You know who you are and I think I mean it when I say that your are my best friend and I love you!

      Often love is not an easy emotion to identify. There are many levels of love, some subtle, some that make your heart want to explode. Sometimes, a feeling isn't even love, but something else. Something that could be confused with love...But could turn into love under the right circumstances.  Love is hard to identify in a second way, also. This is when you need to pick the right rose. I'll apply my personal life as an example. In fifth grade, a breif relationship took place between myself, and someone...Let's call her...Betty. We lasted for maybe two weeks. But then, for a reason that I don't even know for sure now, I felt that I needed to dump Betty. So I did. We began to fight, and slid appart. About a year later, I called up Betty and made ammends. Our friendship hasn't been as strong as it was back then, but we are friends, and I value that. I was making new friends too, one with a girl that we'll call Sally. I found myself with three problems. Was what I was feeling for  both  of them love, or just strong friendship, and, if so, which one did I want to pursue. Here I must interject...My choice of wording is not the best...But one must choose such things. Betty grew upset when I rejected a gesture of affection from her, and quickly signed off IM, not letting me finish my sentence. So I hope that you, the reader, and you, "Betty" can benefit from this.  The Reactor

       For most people dealing with boyfriends, girlfriends or just friends of both sexes is hard. Hell I new it was for me. My first crush was someone who I thought was the biggest deal was instead my biggest scare. I was in the 4th grade and I know that your probably think oh that's no big deal but to me, it was the world. I was always scared to tell him how I felt about him but then after 4 years of not talking and just getting eachother's screen names we started talking talking again and I finally told him. Now I know that it seems like a long time but when you finally tell the person how you feel or felt about them it gets a lot off your chest and you feel much better and who knows maybe you are in for a surprise, I know that after I told him how I felt I found out he felt the same way that whole time. So sometimes it is just better to just come out and say things cause you never know what will happen, you are always in for a surprise but you will never get that surprise if you don't step up and take a chance with things. Cause taking a chance is always better then holding back and wondering what would happen if you told that person. Because what you are wondering will happen when you tell that person usually will happen when you tell them and if it doesn't then its obvious that you haven't found the write person yet and that they are still out there waiting for you to come there way even if you are not ready for you to come there way, they are ready for you.

       Life has got a lot of its ups and a lot of its downs, now how to deal with those ups and downs, that is the question. From friends to parents to siblings to relationships things don't always work out and you have to learn how to deal with that. Its hard, trust me I learned the hard way to but once I figured out that I could more or less work with the things going on around me insted of working against them, I found it worked a lot better for me, and the people around me. The only problem that I found, was getting started on that path and staying on it. So here you get off to a great start on a new you and a way of dealing with the things and people around you, simply just find the thing you are having trouble with and read my advice, now it may not work for everyone but for most people, I think it will.

       Dealing with all types of relationships at some point can be very hard and something that is come across as "a sticky situation" and really it is and it is very hard to get out of and deal with. My first true best friend I met in the 3rd grade and he had a matcher crush on me but I didn't know. We were really good friends and since we had known each other so long and our family's were close and we were young we would have sleepovers and go over each others houses all the time. As the years went by and we kept getting closer I started to like him a little bit, but I would always keep it to myself because I didn't want to screw up our friendship. By the time 5th grade came and we got into the middle school those feelings where starting to slip and I started to crush on this other guy in my class and I was also making new friends that I started to hang out with more then my first guy friend. Of course he took all of this the wrong way and he thought that my new friends where taking me away from him and so one day when we were out at recess my friend and I (she is now my and has been my best friend ever since) where talking and he came over and we got into a stupid fight. Well that fight ended up in my guy friend slapping my new friend across the face and she started to cry (and this was all because he was jealous that her and I were hanging out) I was so mad that I yelled at him and we were never that close again. We talked now and then but he moved to California and we don't talk anymore. So that's the way things are and through all of that you find out who your real friends our and who will stick with you no matter what. I found that my friend who got slapped stuck with me and my guy friend didn't cause he never said sorry or anything. And what you also find as you get older is that people change and go in and out of your life and when you get older, you will be lucky if even to of your friends stick with you through and out of high school and those 2 friends or however many there maybe, are your and the worlds (to you) greatest gems.
