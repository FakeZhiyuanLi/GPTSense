      yeah so allie and i painted my one wall last night. mad fun. its 3 blocks that overlap eachother in some way. they are all green and they all make up other shades when they overlap. it dosen't match the retarded faries on my wall. but whatever. i care little. i am getting rid of them anyways. no matter what. but yeah. it looks so cool. i am in love with it. yeah then we had some much needed fun laughing and trying to seem smart at the winter play at school. then afterwards we ramed into laurel and tried to knock her over. she almost fell in the snow. CRAP! SO CLOSE! hahahaha. then i needed some TLC and well got it. i felt special. we watched "what not to wear" (a-mazing) and fell asleep around....3? 2? i dunno. i wasn't really paying much attention. hahaha. al and i need to hang out more. that was good times. too bad that right now i have a mad headache. mew mew. w/e good nights!

       plus's of last night:  typed an AMAZING lab report for Reed in record time, fell asleep at 7:30ish and woke up about every 2 hours until midnight then after midnight not waking up till i was supposed to, getting almost all of my homework done, found out that when i am upset my sister is the most amazing person ever, was told i was "a stronger person because of *it*".  the deffinate minuses:  when asked "do you really like me mom or do you just force yourself to" she replied "i'm finding it hard to love you let alone liking you right now...ask me later (does that answer your question, dear?), fell asleep at 7 b/c mom said way too bitchy things so i cried myself to sleep and the only way i fell asleep after the other times i woke up was to then again cry myself to sleep, my family is so artificial its like looking at them and you might as well look through a wine bottle (warped but clear as hell), almost shot my brother for following in my parent's footsteps, told mike i would talk to him at 9 or so and he stayed up till about 11 waiting for me to come back and i never did (this is sadly the 4th time in a row i kept him up like that). i very sorry by the way.  I WILL NEVER EVER BE MY PARRENTS. EVEN IF I HAVE TO KILL MYSELF FIRST

        It's actually really funny, You never know what to say, Everyone seems to be against you, And the person you trust most, isn't there..  It all just seems too overwhelming, Because at one time, You loved all of this, You looked forward to it, This place was your haven, But it seems to all have changed, To be more like a prison,  The things you love most in the world, are gone...  And there is no1 to turn to.  If not for Mal... Thanks.. I'm upstairs   *tear* really that made me cry. ilu babes.

      i am so pissed. not only did i not get to talk to *you* after 12pm today but its all my moms fault! shes such a bitch (hey is she can call me one....i'm just returning the favor) FUCK! really! the one thing i look forward to waking up to and the thing i dream about all day and the thing i fall asleep thinking about has been completle taken away from me. my parents love LOVE to take away what is important to me. i swear they would stop feeding me if it wasn't illegal. ass holes.  i was looking at this thing that said "how you know if your g/f is a witch"  #5 was they don't like their families. i'm a witch but deal with it. at this point you should know whether i am or not. eh. i'm tired of all of this bullshit. 2 more years. 2 more years. 2 more years.

      what the hell mother/father!! why don't old people fucking get technology!?!?! just last night i heard the "moo" alert so i ran up to the computer thinking it was mike (cuz thats the amazing alert i put on his s/n when he signs on) and my mom switched to her name. and guess whos it was?! MY BROTHERS! so i was like "o alright" *pause*. *think*. "mom why are all these names popping up? are you signed on"?  my mom: no i am just sitting here not even paying attention to it me: did you sign joseph off? my mom: i thought i did me: *takes amazingly deep breath so as to not pop a cap on her ass* well just Xing out of the buddy list does just that. IT DOSEN'T SIGN YOU OFF! my mom: o i see me: look mom. i tell you this literally EVERY DAY you have to go *here here and here* to sign people off. just closing the boxes not noly ONLY closes the boxes but it pisses people off after they leave you a message and you respond a 1/2 hour later my mom: ok then so then i think "ok i told her this 20 times but maybe this time she'll get it" WRONG AGAIN! she just did it!! i have been signed on but w/o a message up and w/o my knowledge of that for about an hour. WHAT THE FUCK!? so i go totally over say the word "fuck" like i have  20 times in the past fucking 15 mintues (21) but really what the fuck (22). i have no idea what goes on in old peoples heads. I THOUGHT BEING RETARDED WAS SOMETHING YOU HAD FROM BIRTH NOT SOMETHING YOU GET WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE IT!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!! o today was awesome, ya know until i woke up and relized "wow i am at home." aka what the devil would consiter worse then what he lives in (hell). dumb people make me mad. don't be dumb today. or you'll die. cuz i'll kill you.   have a nice day.

      haha. today was fantabulous. well.... i'll just start with L.A. b/c i don't remember much else really.... ok we had to improf a "love triagle". so i was partnered with Eric Vaness (yeah. the Kristin's old b/f one), Dave Sakers, and Kimmy Howard. we decited that it was going to be like the Jerry Spinger Show. i was in love and married to Eric, he liked Kim, and Kim.....liked me..HAHAHAHA. wonderful. so yeah it sucked b/c i kept laughing and turning red, Eric DOSEN'T TALK!, and Dave kept yelling "Jerry Jerry" and "take it off". lol. yeah it was funny but it would have been batter if Dave was a girl and we were guys b/c then he could have "flashed" the class. and i could have peed myself laughing. it was bad yet great all at once.  then i went to the mall with Kris and spent all 20 of my dollars. i got 2 jackets and a ribbon necklace for 20 bucks. good deal. very good deal. i am so proud of myself and so was my mummy. good  day. yes t'was.

      good things that happened today: i was told "i looked really cute today", Allie FINALLY changed obstacles to testacles (i am simply touched), i found out i am NOT comlpletly crazy, i laughed so hard at lunch, i made up a gym class and had "deep" talks with Allie, and told Radzious that she "was the most confusing teacher on the face of this earth". that felt good.  bad things: i fell asleep at 1:30 am and woke up every single 1/2 hour. worst night of sleep in my ENTIRE life, i was rushed, i failed the Doyle test, i bullshitted my way through the photo final, i had a headache all day, and i feel so weak and crappy looking. and now the things i am undecited are good or bad: i want to get my hair cut (never again am i going to the hair dressers with my mom when i want my hair to be grown out), i got ready for school really fast today, my mom was ignoring me, *people* are telling me things that make me smile but i don't think i should be happy about.   thats it. decide for yourselves and get back to me on em'.

      some good lyrics from R.E.M:   At my most beautiful I count your eyelashes, secretly. With every one, whisper I love you. I let you sleep. I know you're closed eye watching me, Listening. I though I saw a smile. I've found a way to make you smile I've found a way A way to make you smile   ~ my most beautiful.     Sometimes everything is wrong. Now it’s time to sing along. When your day is night alone, (hold on, hold on) If you feel like letting go, (hold on) When you think you’ve had too much of this life, well hang on. Everybody hurts. Take comfort in your friends. Everybody hurts. Don’t throw your hand. Oh, no. Don’t throw your hand. If you feel like you’re alone, no, no, no, you are not alone   ~everybody hurts

      i have to stop being sick. it is very annoying. last night i talked to mike again until like 10 or something (new record for shortest time) and for about 15 or so minutes we just listened to frankie flip out and say "fuck" like 50 million times (it was funny i have to admit). but then 1/2 way through i could barely open my eyes and it was kinda dark looking. i know it sounds cheesy to say "and then everything went dark" but i am serious. my mom came in , cuz i was just lying there dying in her room, and took my temperature. it was 102. thats nuts. ehhh!! i hate having a fever!!! ooo it was awful. then i took nyquil and slept till about 1:45 ish. i woke up to hear my dad yelling at my brother for having a messy room. duh dad! he  is  a pig!! way to catch on papa. way to catch on. i do feel better but a week with what we guessed was the flu is never fun. still sick but keepin' on keepin' on.

      ok so yesterday was good... ok i went to my aunt calire's house for my g-mas birthday. we only stayed for a little while and said hi. it was nice because i wanted to eat then just go home because i was exspecting a call. well so then we left about a half hour after we were there and my mom and dad went to take me to delaware because pennsylvania is retarded and the closest olive garden is either in delaware or closer to pittsburg for gods sake. before that, when we were out there we went to sears and looked at the stereos because i wanted to get one for my b-day. i found one...we'll see about it because my mom wants to get me a nicer one...can't say no to that one. then we go to the olive garden and waited about another half hour and i got the best thing there! yummy! si si bon!! so we were eating and i was exspecting mike to call me at around 10 cuz i thought i would be home by then. well he also got ansy and called at around 9:40 and i had it on vibrate/scilent thingy and it was against the wall so it was glowing and vibrating all over the place and that was amusing to me. so then i say "wow, i have to pee" and walked out, went to the bathroom, and called him back (by the way he left me the funniest and most amazing message EVER!) and i told him to call me back at 10:45 ish. he did but i was still in the car and my parents didn't care but my brother made a big deal about it yadda yadda. then i get home around 11 and call him back and then we stayed up till about 5 in the morning talking (new record for us) about everything and anything and it was probably my favorite "till the mo'nin" phone calls. so so so so so so good! massive amounts of fun/sadness/being insance/sex puns. so yes, my b-day weekend was pretty good. next week...DAVE & BUSTERS BABY!! whos with me?!

(gold)  then i went to my brothers basketball game and he played like crap but better than last time  then we went to this steak house with my aunt dawn, uncle jim, my mom, and my brother. people were singing karyoke and drunk off their asses and it wasn't even starting yet, but anyways so my brother orders me a cake (so obvious it hurts but i appriciate the effort) and so like 2 hours later (we were there FOREVER!!!) this piece of chocolate mousse cake with a candle comes out and my uncle starts singing (they also toasted to my b-day before) and so EVERYONE joins in. and my mom said "oo look at the hot guys singing to you" hahaha good one mom. (its true. and they could sing too!) so in all it did not suck it was actually pretty great and one of the best yet!

      k. now this sucks the cock right off a whale. this is going to suck so so so so so bad. if allie dosen't got to bradford i MIGHT have a life on my b-day. maybe. but this 1/2 day and the forgetting of things is just annoying. i was all happy and then BAM!! one person (who at this time will remain nameless) shat all over my plans of this possibly, maybe not, being such a waste of a day. usually when you are a girl and you turn 16 you have this party and your friends don't pratically walk up to you and say "well happy b-day but i have better plans that i just decided to blow you off for even tho i knew about this all of 10 minutes ago and well sorry but we arn't going to hang out tonite." not something like "well wanna come? i said i would invite you and it IS your b-day so common and maybe not have life suck for a little while" but no. sorry. this isn't just sad, its painful...and wrong...and is just all that sucks bunched up and crumpled and thrown on the floor to be stepped on. don't make promises you know full well that you are not going to keep. and yes, you DID promise....

ALL of the 4 best friends are not going to be here either because they wanna do something else, their parents are forcing them, ooor they live across the state. GAH! this will suck soooo soooo bad! maybe i can have it next weekend *sigh* so my plans were: -get "crazy" (if you know what i meen) with my sister and her friends -hang with as many of my friends as possible -meet some of the people kristin just met -get good gifts (my mom is prolly just going to start shopping today, no lie, she got my list last night) all of the above are not going down on my birthday   i feel so shitty and angry about this crap... not too angry tho because my parents planned my b-day party...w/o me...didn't ask me if i liked the idea in the first place...last minute planning (like yesterday they came up with this...literally)  ...i still want that crown tho. lol. or not. w/e works....

      From Ashley's Blog...  get angry if you must but if you are in INTENSE cathlolic then brace yourself before reading this...  1 Timothy 2  12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.   Ephesians 5  22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.  23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.   Leviticus 12  "5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days."   Speak to the people of Israel, saying: If a woman conceives and bears a male child, she shall be ceremonially unclean seven days; as at the time of her menstruation, she shall be unclean. Her time of blood purification shall be thirty-three days; she shall not touch any holy thing, or come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification are completed. If she bears a female child, she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation; her time of blood purification shall be sixty-six days. (Lev. 12:2-5)   If [the city] accepts your terms of peace and surrenders to you, then all the people in it shall serve you at forced labor. If it does not submit to you peacefully, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it; and when the LORD your God gives it into your hand, you shall put all its males to the sword. You may, however, take as your booty the women, the children, livestock, and everything else in the town, all its spoil. You may enjoy the spoil of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you. (Deut. 20:11-14)    "And if men struggle and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him, and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise."  Exodus 21:22-25    Psalm 119  151 Yet you are near, O LORD ,  and all your commands are true.  152 Long ago I learned from your statutes  that you established them to last forever.    If you're going to say that it's ok to bash gays because The Bible said so, then I hope that you regularly beat women, because the Bible says you should. And I hope you don't let your mom sleep in the same bed as your dad when she's bleeding between the legs. Because she's going to hell, then. And as a women, YOU SUCK. Because God said so. -Ashley   um. wow. not wanting to go to church today. and. sorry not giving anything up this lent. sorry. i understand if you are mad or oppose but that changes a lot of perspective and does not persuade me to think i am better for my reliegion or bash others (not that i ever did). i feel completly lost...

      Lola Lyrics  I met her in a club down in old Soho  Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola [LP version:  Coca-Cola]  C-O-L-A cola  She walked up to me and she asked me to dance  I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola  L-O-L-A Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola   Well I'm not the world's most physical guy  But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine  Oh my Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola  Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand  Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man  Oh my Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola   Well we drank champagne and danced all night  Under electric candlelight  She picked me up and sat me on her knee  And said dear boy won't you come home with me  Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy  But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola  Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola  Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola   I pushed her away  I walked to the door  I fell to the floor  I got down on my knees  Then I looked at her and she at me   Well that's the way that I want it to stay  And I always want it to be that way for my Lola  Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola  Girls will be boys and boys will be girls  It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola  Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola   Well I left home just a week before  And I'd never ever kissed a woman before  But Lola smiled and took me by the hand  And said dear boy I'm gonna make you a man   Well I'm not the world's most masculine man  But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man  And so is Lola  Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola  Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola     -BY THE KINKS!!

      today was another crappy day. why you ask? i'll tell you-  ok so i found out that * i am very very irritated * when i am very VERY IRRITATED i don't like people to be "just joking around" that puts me in a more than pissed off mood and i become very very bitchy * you are really not as funny as you think you are * if i had a shovel it would be smacked into your face right now.  * i have to get better at school....cuz if you haven't noticed i am very bad at it in general * its not PMS, its the clear fact that i hate you * school should be burn down right now * i don't belive in heaven or hell and could care less because i am living now and when i die i won't know the diffrence. i think we should all just sit on our rump little asses all day and sleep/eat/joke/laugh/ make love (sure why not. i can do w/e i want so nanna nanna boo boo) and not judge people...but the world as i see it right now is just another exscuse for acne. * being a teenager is not all its hyped up to be * i need to think about myself just a little bit more if i want to ever get out of high school * i am done ranting...for now

      stolen from  urlLink   urlLink this random person   What's sexy?    Modern society shoves sex at us from every angle 24/7, such that we are sated and unsurprised by it all, and have forgotten the pleasures of the tease, of being tantalized, of buildup, of true eroticism, and in general of all the things that used to be seen as sexy before the days of breast implants and thongs. Women, who to this day are judged primarily on looks and sex appeal, have had, since movies and then TV brought beautiful and provocative images into the lives of all men, to go to ever greater extremes to be ahead of the curve sexual-display wise, which forced the curve to move, and so on. The use of female sexiness to sell EVERYTHING, from breakfast cereal to entire movies, meant that these ever more extreme images have pounded our brains to near numbness, so that imagery that would have given our grandparents heart attacks just makes us shrug... so what can we get to seem sexy, REALLY sexy, to us any more?  Those of us old enough to remember the not-so-distant past, in which a man would be aggressive in his sexual pursuit but not "look" sexy, dress sexy, or ACT sexy can see that, with women having gone so far to "out-sexy" each other that they've become virtually indistinguishable, and therefore rather dull, with their hair extensions and push-up bras, it's really only MALE attempts at sexual display that are novel enough to BE sexy anymore.  Don't believe it? In an attempt to keep the female body "new" and exciting, they've had no choice but to cover it up more; compare what actresses were wearing 5-10 years ago with what they wear NOW, for example. It's not just famous women who are changing, although they are always the first TO change, as their $ depends on them being the most sexy: Have you noticed the increasing popularity of women's underpants that look like shorts, and cover more of the female lower body than any popular undergarment has done in DECADES? Of skirts that make you think of Audrey Hepburn rather than "stripper"? Of women, even quite young ones, returning to the 70's idea of sexy with jeans and a moderately revealing top rather than all wearing hooker outfits? Sexiness DOES require some element of novelty, and, once you've gotten thoroughly used to seeing nearly-naked, it ceases to create the most excitement any more, and something more covered up seems exciting (not to mention classier).  Meanwhile, we're seeing MEN grooming themselves, moisturizing, using hair products (have you heard the term "metrosexual," referring to a straight man who grooms himself to the level a gay man would?), working out, dieting, and dressing to show it off, especially men in the entertainment industry. Men's magazines and catalogs of men's clothing are filled with pics that are nearly pornographic, in part to interest gay men, of course, but in general because we're now ready as a culture to see men being sexy; magazines for women, such as Cosmo, are filled with "naughty" pics of men that would have seemed extreme not that long ago.  Any new male actor shows us his washboard abs as reliably as new starlets used to show their cleavage. Male beauty and sexiness is now being marketed in the way women's has always been, and men now have a degree of beauty and sexiness that they've never had before; look at photos of old-time male stars, who were older, less attractive by FAR, and muscle-free compared to modern heartthrobs, and you can't miss it.  The female form has been hyper-eroticized and exaggerated to the point that the pendulum is swinging back to something less sleazy, something that leaves a bit to the imagination. What's sexiest now is the MEN who suddenly have bare skin, hard bodies, bulging groins, and loose, sensual body language; since women now have the $ to pay for whatever those sexy images of men point them to, male sexiness is good business, and that make it easy for this trend to take off in a way it never could have before.  Yes, men are still looking at the same sort of nudie pics they always have, for the same purpose they've always used them for, but they are biologically programmed to be easily bored, and are willingly turning to images of a less blatantly-displayed female form as the ideal, while male sex symbols are becoming MORE blatant, more "hot." As a woman, I've gotta say that I'm looking forward to MEN getting steadily nakeder and more "obvious" in the years to come, while women go back to being more "ladylike" and old-school sexy; turnabout is fair play!! :-)

      well lets talk about last night shall we?.... ok so i went to the franklin mills mall with my mom and my sister. of course before we left we had had had to stop at WaWa. so we did. i got this peanut butter/chocolate cappichino (i know. sounds so nasty but OMG its amazing!!) and a s'more pie thing. (god, the things i eat together) and of course a water for the hour long ride. we listened to U2 greatest hits CD and rocked out. i want that CD now sooo bad. so then my mom and sister talked about how much they hate marshmallows and my mom ranted about how she hates s'mores (devil) and my sister ranted about how she hates marshmallows at all but likes s'mores (santin). i was just sitting back there laughing at them and singing a s'more song that i made up to a U2 beat. it was good.   at the mall:  ok so we get to the mall and loose my mom cuz she walked into the sacks5thave. store and we walked into the "aqua entrance" it was soooo windy and as a joke my sister and i smacked ourselves against the doors like we were blown into them and people starred and we laughed at them and omg it was a-mazing. so we go into, no lie, at leasst 20some stores and found a few dresses but nothing that i really liked or thought would be right for the dance. ugh. no store went un-touched. so we walk around from anout 3-6:30 some and after a while i got really angry because i found nothing and i need this dress sooner than anyone. so i cried in neiman marcus or w/e that UGLY store is. i hated that place. so after all that and NO luck at all we go to the king of prussia mall....  king of prussia: we went into this one store, the first we went into, and WAHBAM!! so many amazing dresses. so i run through there like a kid in a candy store. i try on 5 dresses. the one i LOVED was perfect. i wouldn't have even needed to get it fitted. it even fit my hips right AND my ribcage!!! HOLY SWEET MOTHER OF JESUS!! so i come out all excited in this a-mazing, 20's looking dress and my moms like "thats perfect" and my sister said the same thing. looked at the price tag....$268.00!!!! AHHHH NOOOO FUUUUCK! so of course my mom says no b/c she only gave my sister a $150.00 budget for junior prom last year. *cries* so we leave and look everywhere else. and the last store we went into, EXPRESS, is where we found my dress that i baught. it really pretty and sexy actually. its this red, almost salsa dancing, looking thing. and i love it. really. not what i set out for but ya know. get what you are given. i am gonna add my own thing to it too so it looks diffrent and more pretty and more like something i would pay a lot for. cuz tahts jsut my style!! OW OW!  thanks to kristin calling me or i would have kicked all the clerks one-by-one who tried to help me and really just pissed me off to no end.   and then thanks mike, for staying up till 3:45 talking about random fun stuff like we do every Saturday night. even if my mom did tell me to get off the phone at 12. me he.

       Boiler Lyrics  -Limp Bizkit  Looks like I'm a do everything myself Maybe I could use some help but hell You want some done right You gotta do it yourself Maybe life is up and down but My life has been what till now I crawled up your butt somehow And that's when things got turned around I used to be alive I feel pathetic and now I get it What's done is done You just leave it alone and don't regret it But sometimes some things turn into dumb things And that's when you put your foot down.  Why did I have to go and meet somebody like you (like you) Why did you have to go and hurt somebody like me (like me) How could you do somebody like that (like that) Hope you know that I'm never coming back (never coming back).  Looks like I'm a do everything myself (everything myself) Maybe I could use some help but hell You want some done right You gotta do it yourself (got it) Maybe life is up and down but My life has been what till now (got it) I crawled up your butt somehow (got it) And that's when shit got turned around (got it) I used to be alive I'm so pathetic and now I get it What's done is done I know you just leave it alone and don't regret it But sometimes some things turn into dumb things And that's when you put your foot down.  Why did I have to go and meet somebody like you (like you) Why did you have to go and hurt somebody like me (like me) How could you do somebody like that Hope you know that I'm never coming back (You know that I'm never coming back). (2x)  Depending on you is done Giving to you is done No more eating, no sleeping, no living, it's all just more giving to you and I'm done Depending on you is done And giving to you is done No more eating, no sleeping, no living, it's all just more giving to you and I'm done The hiding from you is done The lying from you is done No more eating, no sleeping, no living, it's all just more giving to you and I'm done  Why did I have to go and meet somebody like you (like you) Why did you have to go and hurt somebody like me (like me) How could you do somebody like that Hope you know that I'm never coming back (You know that I'm never coming back). (2x)  Why! (6x) (You pissed on, you dissed on) (2x) Why (Why)

      so i'm looking for a dress. i have 2 so far...  then i look at shoes. ok why is it that they are either HANUS or HIDEOUS or just plain "ouch". o my poor feet  example:   CLASSIFIED AS: hanus and hideous. i know some people like Laura Flynn Boyle but common now. her fashion is...just wow.   example #2:   CLASSIFIED AS: just plain ugly.   example #3:  ok now these are hot/cute but um. my feel will KILL me. i won't be able to walk for like a week  so see? its not that i am not excited about the dance. its just that its so hard to to get shoes and a dress and normally is a huge pain in the ass to get a date then have him match. oy. but again it will be good it will be good it will be FUN!

       Only Wanna Be With You Lyrics -Hootie and the Blowfish   You and me  We come from different worlds  You like to laugh at me  When I look at other girls   Sometimes you're crazy  And you wonder why  I'm such a baby  Cause the Dolphins make me cry   Well there's nothing I can do I've been looking for a girl like you  You look at me You've got nothing left to say I'll only pout at you until I get my way I won't dance You won't sing I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring.  Chorus:  Well there's nothing I can do  I only wanna be with you  You can call me your fool  Only wanna be with you   Put on a little Dylan  sitting on a fence  I say that line is great  You ask me what I meant by  Said I shot a man named Gray  Took his wife to Italy  She inherited a million bucks  And when she died it came to me  I can't help it if I'm lucky  Only wanna be with you  Ain't Bobby so cool  Only wanna be with you   (Solo)   Yeah I'm tangled up and blue  Only wanna be with you  You can call me your fool  Only wanna be with you   Sometimes I wonder  If it will ever end  You get so mad at me  When I go out with my friends  Sometimes you're crazy  And you wonder why  I'm such a baby yeah  The Dolphins make me cry   Well there's nothing I can do  Only wanna be with you  You can call me your fool  Only wanna be with you  Yeah I'm tangled up in blue  Only wanna be with you

KRISTIN & DAN: holy crap *faces turn red* ME: what? whats wrong? DAN: *shows me the cover* reads: "Ultimate Sex" i saw a picture. ME: hahaha well didn't you think that it would be something a little "sex" like BY READING THE COVER?! DAN: well you didn't see the picture kristin and i saw ME: you idiots DAN: *tries to find picture again* ME: no close it *sees a part of a thigh and looks away*  hahahahhaa. that was so good. omg.and it was "calling" to dan...now i know why. if only you were there.....

      last night i was all depressed and upset b/c i didn't get to talk to *people* and now i am furious b/c when i did i felt like i was being yelled at and mis-trusted by the one person who i thought trusted me most and up until about now i was really happy with that. now i feel like me being happy makes everone else unhappy and confused and mad at me. shut up! really! god! if you don't feel like you can trust me then sod off! if you can't trust me now then you never will so either shut up and trust me (because you can!!!) or run off with someone that you feel you can trust. and if you think you can trust them over me then you have shitty judgement and something is wrong with you. no joke. say anything like that again and i will bust your ass open. its out of hand. again shut up. i don't wanna hear about it.

      yep yep. today was long and pointless and yeah. i dunno. i have a headache. this is what i remember: math: studied for mid-term tomorrow...gonna do alright i think but probably won't SAT: dan and i making faces at eachother b/c it was ass-numbingly boring and slow as hell gym: pratically peed myself with ashley and allie b/c it was insanely funny. we are cool. really.  lunch: dan sat with us. bastard lady who sits out side of the smoke-smelling bathroom yelled at me for saying "fuck" (by the way fuck is not a cool word anymore. say "cat" instead). then kristin and kacie said something about me likeing dan again and kristin laughed so hard she said "omg i almost choked on my cookie" and i said "why didn't you?" (it was a joke people). only dan and i laughed and everyone else who heard it yelled at me. again it was a joke. LA- read some more of "a mid summer nights dream" (sooo sooo good) SS- mr. doyle was a sub for the real mr. doyle (how cool is that?!) science- passed the test but am unsure about just how well i did boring then exciting then back and forth a million times but eh i lived...

      everyone should listen to indie rock. y? because its a-mazing. specailly in your in the mood i am. ok... i thought i was going out with kristin today. i thought wrong. our parents both flipped a bitch on us. her parents don't wanna drive in the "bad weather" (even tho they took her to dance and i don't see whats so wrong with them swinging by and picking me up then taking us to the mall or w/e as were our original plans) then when she asks if my mom can take us my mom flipped a huge bitch and pissed me off. he pulled the o-so untrue thing about her "driving people everywhere and always taking my friends places" and that my friend is a huge crock of shit right there. she never drives me around like that and sorry i was born too late to have my lisence now. that is not my fault. if its anyones its hers. i was not picking the time i was born so shut up. god mom. and i also don't understand why 5 of my sisters friends showed up and they are all what 17? 18? and they can drive in the goddamn rain. @%%&#&^*#%@$%!%&^* parents everywhere.....thumbs up your asses.

      2 hour delay!! yeah! i am still mad tho. my alarm dosen't work and turns itself off, i thought i missed the bus, my hair is not too long to get out of my facce but its too short to just bobby-pin it or something, its cold, i am cold...  ever have one of those pointless days where you have nothing better to do but day-dream and then get mad at those thoughts but for no reason at all?! i am mad at people....just because i let my head take over. ok never again. i got mad at mike last night b/c i felt like yelling at someone. though he prolly didn't pick up on it (hes too sweet to think bad things of me) i still was. then when i tried to watch LOST IN TRANSLATION, the DVD from hell, it skipped and when we cleaned it it would not play at all. hillarious movie turned pain in my ass. i mean. i was really enjoying it. it was so funny. bill murray is god. then you got a lot of this: "what are you d___ng h__r i ___ and _____ and then ____ haha" "yeah i kn__ what you _een" WHAT THE HELL?!  well sorry if i flip a bitch on you today. just let it go. meh meh mew mew

BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHHAHA! ok you're right. i'll stop now. hahaha ~ we talked more about babies and it was hystericle. i laughed so hard that i couldn't stop for like 15 minutes and when i took a drink i had to spit it out over the table hahaha. o wow. i still laugh at that....

       I picked you out of a crowd and talked to you.  I said, "I like your shoes." You said, "Thanks can I follow you?" So it's up the stairs and out of view.  No prying eyes. I poured some wine.  I asked your name. You asked the time.  It is 2 o'clock. The club is closed and we are up the block.  Your hands are on me. I am pressing hard against your jeans.  Your tounge is in my mouth, trying hard to keep the words from coming out. You didn't care to know who else may been you before.  I want a lover I don't have to love.  I want a girl that is too sad to give a fuck.  Where's the kid with the chemicals?  I thought he said to meet him here, but I'm not sure.  I got the money if you've got the time.  You said, "It feels good." I said, "I'll give it a try."  Then my mind went dark.  We both forgot where your car was parked.  Let's take the train. I'll meet up with the band in the morning.  Bad actors with bad habits.  Some sad singers they just play tragic.  Well, the phones ringing and the van is leaving.  Let's just keep touching. Let's just keep singing.  I want a lover I don't have to love.  I want a boy who is so drunk he doesn't talk.  Where's the kid with the chemicals?  I have a hunger and I can't seem to get full.  I need some meaning I can memorize.  The kind I have always seem to slip my mind.  But you write such pretty words.  But life is no storybook.  Love is an excuse to get hurt and to hurt.  "Do you like to hurt?" "I do. I do." "Then hurt me."  -Bright Eyes, Lover I Don't Have To Love

      ok so my birthday present (keep in mind my birthday was in february) was to go see townhall at some point before the summer. my sister was supposed to be giving me this "gift".  (also keep in mind that there was no effort in this "gift" because the show was/is free) now because she has a 12ft pole wedged up her fat-square ass, i am no longer going. her away message reads:   i HATE my family! Anyone want to go to Townhall? Mallory isn't coming so there's room in the car!    Schu-call me bitoch!   hey cunt face, you suck. my parents forgot about my birthday (i just found this out when my mom was talking on the phone to my dad about her and my sisters chronic pms and reminded my father that i only got my bracelet for my birthday because she forgot that it was my birthday and because i happen to conveniently remind her), my brother did not get me anything at all (i spend AT LEAST $25 every birthday he has ever had when really i would rather give him arsenic and kill him anyway), and the only reason for my sister taking me to this concert was because she didn't get me anything, it was free, she would seem like the bigger person if she got me a gift and my "horrible parents" forgot that i existed.   wow. you all just suck. o and by the way, for your birthdays for now on you are getting rat poison or something because you do not deserve real gifts that take any thought or effort what so ever. i couldn't give 2 shits about any of you any more. enough said. 2 more years till i can walk out and never turn back and 4 more years to suck every last penny out of them for college education and until i never have to even be in the same state, country, zip code, breathing space as them ever again. life seems good from that point of view.

      last night was so funny We left the play because i "fell asleep and was out cold" not really 100% true but w/e. well so we walked over to friendly's. i got an ice cream and first everyone wanted some whipped cream. no problem but then griffin stuck her finger in it to get some hot fudge (that sounds so wrong) and it went all over the place and in my iced tea. then dan hopped on that bandwagon and with the same finger he licked he put it back and did that about three times and so did griffin. hahahahahaha. it was really funny tho. then griffin spilled her drink all over the place....i will type more later. apparently my computer is being a FUCKING HOE BAG RIGHT NOW!!!! i am too frustrated for words!!!!!

      i have lost so much trust in people in the past 24 hours. everyone changed almost completly over night and i am finding things out all the sudden that i should have known before. now my head is going in all different directions and i can't think striaght. if i come off sracastic, bitchy, irritaded, confused, quiet, sad, overjoyed, or bored (amugnst other things i can't think of right now) than i will say "its not your fault" but in reality it probably is. either get it fixed by talking to me or shut up.

      ok, its 11:19 so its still friday! enough time for the  friday five :   If you...    1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?  i would sell healthy food that tasted like junk food. i dunno if that exist but that would be awesome. and i would eat there all the time and i could eat free because, well hell! i own it!   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?  prolly like a mini borders. books, food, coffee, music, so just about all my favorite things in the store but smaller and less expencive than borders.    3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?  well thats ironic. it would be a realistic-fiction type of deal. about high school and how people suck but you make the best of it and how its only 4 years of your life so the only thing that matters is your work and the GOOD friends you keep and not all the social "i get drunk to be cool" type of bullshit people constantly pull. i would also publish some of my journals- yes i have journals. everyone should.    4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?  ENGLISH!! i want to be an english teacher at this point anyway so that works.    5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?  hahahaha! my sister and i were talking about this earlier: something my sister and i could do mad dancing to in our library raves (thats kinda an oxymoron) and didn't make much sence but would be so so so so so amazingly fun. and everyone would love it because i wrote/and sang a song . then the video would be shot with my sister and i and a bunch of random other people dancing like idiots (so much fun!) in random offices around the world. i love my sister. just watch me do it too!as for the rest of the album- all the same things just a little mixed up words. and dan, i'd let you do the mixes. lol. you know what i'm talking about.   THAT WAS THE BEST FUCKING FRIDAY FIVE EVER!!!!!!! YEEEEEEEEES!

       Laid Lyrics    This bed is on fire With passionate love The neighbors complain about the noises above But she only comes when she's on top  My therapist said not to see you no more She said you're like a disease without any cure She said I'm so obsessed that I'm becoming a bore, oh no Ah, you think you're so pretty  Caught your hand inside the till Slammed your fingers in the door Fought with kitchen knives and skewers Dressed me up in women's clothes Messed around with gender roles Dye my eyes and call me pretty  Moved out of the house, so you moved next door I locked you out, you cut a hole in the wall I found you sleeping next to me, I thought I was alone You're driving me crazy, when are you coming home -James

      o wow so waking up from last night... last night was really eventfunl. and woah so much fun. ok so peoples came by 4 and at first we were going to go eat pizza then leave to go to D&B. well since some people were cock-faces and 2 of my really really good friends showed up, we ate at D&B instead of crappy pizza. so we go and we are takin pics in my car and laughing at my brother. well, then my dad needs to drop a package before we go to D&B. so, he took up to this strange part of the city, that i knew, and realized that its less threatening when its light out. lol. ok so then we get to D&B and i am STARVING! so we are up peoples asses waiting for a table.  ok so we sit down, order, laugh, take pics, and hit the backrest because the terd-faces behind us keep hitting it so we, being the amazing people we are, would yell "goddamn it", or at least i would, and hit it back and keep it there. hahahahaha. it was good. ok so, then we get our food and its so so so so so so so so so so good! omg! i wanted to die it was so good. k then my parents had gotten the money put on our cards and we each got $25 worth (130 pts-the max you can get) and laurel spent them SO fast so we were laughing at her, but she was laughing too so it was alright, and my parents realized that we were running low, so they RECHARGED ALL OUR CARDS WITH ANOTHER $25!!! i was so shocked, even though my dad said i could spend anything i wanted...what a great dad. so of course, i was nice about it, but did just as he said!   then my dad won me this huge orca whale ("sounds kinda orca-ish don't you think") and we kept calling it "my huge dork"...ok if you don't get that joke, shoot yourself in the face. hahahaha. lotsa puns. so then we are full of amazing food, energy, and we are running around. all things tho must come to an end and it was 10 o'clock, and i thought we were leaving around 9:30 but i'm glad we didn't because we had to cash in all our tickets...and have KEY LIME PIE!! so as we were eating our pie, the waitress brought out a candle, stuck it in my pie, and they sang "happy birthday". i was surprised i didn't turn red. it was so sweet! and as we walked out this lady told me happy birthday. it was nice. then we were leaving with our prizes and wth our tickets- laurel & al had in the 800's and i had 1583! hahaha! i win! they both got boxers (laurel was so excited that she put them on....over her pants....in the front hallway...yes in front of 50 some people...and in front of the glass doors..hahahaha. it was so good). so sorry if you missed out. when i get my camera running here i'll upload the pics. *excited* hahahaha. mew mew! GOOOD TIIIIMES!!!  then of course as i was pulling in the driveway my michael called me and we talked about lotsa things *wink* and didn't stop till 4am....of course. hahahaha. omg. what an a-mazing night. i love my friends. you are the best, guys. much love!!

      Bienvenue Mes Amies!!!  urlLink Kristin Steph and I  went to lovely Canada on a French trip last week. On the ride up there  urlLink Kristin and I  were awake for the most part. Steph was a bum  urlLink and took a nap . I   urlLink tried  to take anap also but things were just getting started and I could not sleep...at least not at first. Eventually we arrived at  urlLink Montreal  after many many many  urlLink stops  along the way. We would stop at nice reasturaunts instead of  urlLink fast food crappy ones . I was completly surprised. We decided that we were going to walk around in both Quebec and Montreal even if it was  urlLink freezing!!!  Everything looked all  urlLink nice  and  urlLink sunny  but looks were very decieving there. There were still a lot of  urlLink beautiful  places to go and see but remember we only had 5 days so everything was planned down to the minute. Even taking the  urlLink subway  was planned. I just didn't know it was coming and was never told that we were going on one. it was so fast and so much fun. Kristin was pole dancing on the subway too. WELCOME TO CANADIA!!!

      i guess that was resolved. ok so if it was then why do i feel like i could either punch someone or be really "dirty" if you get the hint.....FUCK! this pisses me off beyond belief! and i really can't do anything about it anymore. i really dont want to be a slut or anything but i have to have some way around not being slutty, being faithful, not feeling jaded, and yet do everything people don't ecspect from "sweet little innocent timid mallory." GAH! i hope canda has no idea what they are getting themselves into....

      -- same person and another good entry: "You, reading my journal, please don't have streotypes of what gay, or any other people, are supposed to be like. We're just people who fall in love with people of the same sex. Everything else is arbritary and each one of us can decide what features of our personality we like. We're not all funny, we're not all fashion mavens, we're not all snappy, not all of us certainly dress in drag, and I don't want "Wil & Grace" or "American Idol". Keep that in mind."

HEAVEN FORBID!   god damn!!!! he kept asking for 15, 10, and even 5 more minutes and she kept saying "no, michael. no" GRAH!! just let us talk!! jesus! i don't tell my mother she can't talk to her mother, sisters, friends, brothers who qualify for long distance. lay off!!  not only that but sean, his 18 year old brother, has a g/f who EVERYONE but sean HATES and he talkes to her in school, when they drive each other places, AND 3 hours every night on the phone EVERYDAY and yet I am the problem?!?! what?!?!?!  no i don't think so. ok that phone bill from canada was a mistake. i get that thank you. but everyother time ITS BEEN FREEEEEE!!! then they were like "no we are taking away your cell phone" and well guess what rents?! I AM GONNA RUN THAT PHONE BILL TO HELL!!!   i  try  to save them money. and i  try  to be rational but those who know me best would not call me a rational person.   not only that but they are "you call too much" ok i was talking to a few people in canada, yes canada, adn they ALL told me that come 9pm they are on the phone with their b/fs and g/fs and not ONLY that but they also see eachother everyday in school. and can KISS their others and HUG their others and for hells sake they could HAVE A ORGY OF MASS PROPORTIONS IF THEY WANTED TO! i dont have that convenience so please, let me keep what i  DO  have and do with it what i please. thank you.

      ok so today i: woke upp around 11:30 ish and excited because i could watch some hard core jerry springer and maury and yadda yadda.   jerry springer- i saw the episode so i was really not amused..so i daydreamed in bed lol.  and maury- nofolks, no paternity tests, no boot camp, no cheating and hidden cameras. no. it was jack hanna showing off his animals. whoopdy-doo.  ok so then i went out to the mall for a while with my brother and sister. we went to sam goody and someone stole $20 from me. now i am new CD-less and got starred at A LOT by this hiddle of guys taht were laughing. ok then?  then we went to paneras (or however you spell it). again, there was another group of guys sitting outside (yes in the rain...morons) and they were laughing too. except they stopped talking and laughing when my sister and i walked by. my brother was still behind us and i looked back and said "god, where is he" to keep from laughing my ass off. i, mallory e. flynn, then almost pummeled myself into a wet RAUD IRON chair. luckily my hand was there and i stopped myself. i act like a moron when i try to act "myself". yeah, that says a lot. oy.   then i came home and watched the "what not to wear myth marathon". i ADORE that show.  and now i am here...typing to all of the 4 people who read this...and listening to everyone in my family run around like morons. all together i would say it was a good damn day.  i love the rain.

       The Question: Is it possible to 'love' someone you haven't physically met, but who you''d care to know deeper mentally? Perhaps.   The real answer:  Still, you feel comforted because they seemingly understand your secret intentions and hold them higher than the one to whom you entrusted your first physical offerings to.  loving it:  And it didn't matter that you were alone, because the thought of this one's interest and assumed touch caused greater pleasure than the actual act of being violated to fruition by another come-and-go.   i read this in someones blog. its a good thing to read all tehse blogs. makes you think ya know?   my prayers have been answered and thank god someone else who dosen't know me and i don't know her, share the same opinion.   lately people have agreed simply because they accept it not beacause they believe it.   ...well believe it.

      "Maybe God wanted us to meet the wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift. Maybe when the door of happiness closes, another opens. But often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us. Maybe the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. Maybe it is true that we don't know what we have got until we lose it, and it is also true that we don't know what we have been missing until it arrives..."   ...yeah maybe

      ok so my mom called mrs. riley. thats right ladies and gentlemen- Mike's mom! ok this sucks balls that she did this. first she called complaining about me i'm sure. they both bitched about phone bills and yadda yadda (o what problems the "children" of today cause). they came to an "agreement"- i can call him fridays and saturdays until 11 and i can call at 10. WWWWWWHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!?!?!?!??!?! never going to happen. i'm sorry but seriously mike is what keeps me alive on the weekdays. ok take that too.   then my mother insulted me by saying:"what are you going to do? buy your own cell phone on what? your looks?"  you dumb fuck head. what is your problem?!? cuz GOD KNOWS i can't actualyl get a job or anything. i guess i need a brain for that too and the only job i can get on "my looks" is a job at hooters or something. thats complete bullshit. i know i can find a way around this. you don't have to be a genious to get around the morons i call "parents".   i won't be getting my cell back for at least a month now. again tho, we will see about this 2 hours a week bull shit.  o and thanks mom for ranting about me but not saying anything GOOD or liek arranging for em to see him. not like this will make them want to see me either. hmmm. good job you self centered ass wipe.  i hate my life

      Defensive is a child of a succesful marriage of insecurity and low self-esteem. Do you mind if someone said something totally untrue about you? Will you step up to defend yourself or will you simply smile? Will you draw out your sword and prepare for battle or will you laugh over it and find this an excuse to feast with them? When they point their finger at you, do you hold their finger and point to somewhere else?  i duno who this girl is but i found her blog hopping. thanks much you smart girl you!

      ok being home and around my parents is like repeatedly stabbing yourself. ridiculas. thanks to my friends (i love you all) its getting better, but still. being a teenager and w/o a car, a lisence, hell i dont even have my fuckig permit, sucks cock like no other.   i say all of us (lunch table, pittsburg people, random others) go to the beach and just lay on the sand for a while. its really what we all need. last day of school instead of just me and SUPAFLY going to the beach, i say i pack everyone in the mini-van with my sister and we cruise down to the beach. i can dream can't i? how many of you can fit into a bedroom/living room? i'm tiny, i can fit into most overhead storage compartments and suitcases! so i can sleep across the headboard of a twin sized bed and someone can sleep against my stomach..actually 2 people can. ok so thats 3 people on my bed. hmm. my sister could fit 5 people on her floor when people came down to visit her on our last VACA. ok so far i have 6-7 people. ok and 2 or so on another bed? ok so thats 8-9. ok and now in the living room. thats at least 5 more people AT LEAST. who wants on that? let me know. lol. wishful thinking? i hope not.

      so surreal.   everyones week has sucked so much lately. this week and last.  dan prolly won't get his tattoo and his car that he wanted. i know, its really not fair. i hear ya.   i was so sick this morning. almost barffed like 3 times (charming i know), i took at least 12 advil total today and my headache STILL won't go away, and my eyes were no bigger than slits. gah. it sucks to be like this and feel like a puddle of jell-o the whole day.  called mike. beth (my mum) caught me talking to mike. i had to cut it short and kicked her out of the room and she said she wasnt leaving until i hung up and i said i wouldnt hang up till she left. she left telling me she was going downstairs to see if i was still on. i had to whisper "i love you" and quickly i got off the phone. sucks. what happens when the one you turn to gets taken away? couldn't find my brothers cell to call him either like i did last night. poo poo poo.   this weekend i am finishing chores and getting my damn cell back. what did i ever do with out it? o yeah- get yelled at for my crazy phone bills. they still complein that i talk too much on it. its nto bothering them because its free and i do things and get jobs done. i would rather talk to people i like than be forced around people i dont. eh, bite me.   ALLIE GOT A CELL PHONE! lucky bitch hahaha. now there will be more than mike and kristin's #s on my bill. muahahahaha! smack it!

      So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, Blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field From a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?  And did they get you to trade Your heros for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange A walk on part in the war For a lead role in a cage?  How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl, Year after year, Running over the same old ground. What have we found? The same old fears. Wish you were here.

      i was just reading  The Lovely Bones . that book makes me angry now. one minute your like "yes! go! thats awesome!" next you think "GOD SHES A WHORE! HOW COULD SHE?! DOSEN'T SHE KNOW WHAT SHES DOING?!" i dunno. too much of a roller coaster but i keep wanting to go back to it minutes after i put it down...   anyways...  a few things came clear today. like that people can play with my head and flip me upside down all the time. i hate it yet i let them do it anyway. it has happened too many times in the past few weeks. people control my thinking and my emotions and thats just crap. i have lost all control over them. it sucks. i want to get out of high school. hopefull people in the real world will grow up before i slap them all.   i have some really wise friends who give me really wise thoughts. they have the crazyest (sp?) ways of showing that they care but they let you realize that they do care, they just don't have to act sad and depressed with you to prove it. laughter is the best thing ever.   i need to start publishing things that i think and do. thank you blogger!   i know what i want. i hatve it. i won't let YOU change it. piss off if you don't like it.   this summer is going to be so good. i can feel it. go away people who piss me off. Hel-lOOOO awesome people.   i really want to make movies and have a band with "The Special EDS" HAHAHAHAHAHA. i told you my friends were cool!   i feel a little bit better. again, than you blogger!

WONDERFUL!   and on top of that she reminded me that Maryland and its people are smelly. isn't she wonderful?!   thanks allie + her parents whom i love more than my own! you are all wonderful! o and vegeterian dinners every night. i could get used to that!   *oober excited!*  ...haha my mom just now said "hey mal, why dont u finish these steps by vacuuming them?" hahaha i haven't been talking to her for like 5 hours straight today so right now she is putting away the vacuume. its sad and helpless but...wall KARMA, dear KARMA

      ok so with thses chore/punishment thingys...  i was supposed to do 40 hours of work. what my parents dont understand is that they are slow and it may take them 40 hours to get a few things done but not here.   i made a few ajustments tho- instead of 40hours of work i am now doing 30.5. how do you ask? well thanks to them being retarded and me being smart and of course thanks to modern day technologies- i went to the list my mom typed up and changed the hours a bit. yes thats right, i was sneaky and cut my time down by 9.5 hours.   so far by my calculations i have worked 11.5 hours. but wait- its only been about 4.5 hours. hmmm. this is strange. well if they can't do math, neither can i. this is now by how long it feels.  this morning i woke up in a decent mood for no reason. i have no idea why either because last night was awful and i should have woken up in a bad mood also but i didnt. i actually wanted to clean! i did last night too when i cleaned the bathroom. hmmm again this is very strange.   yes so my cleaning-happy mood carried over. i was cleaning then BAM my mother pisses me off once again. so i am taking my good old time and not sleeping tonight if these are not all done. i hope she spasses out from all the fumes :-D   every hour they dont fix the hose to clean the windows i am clocking...

      ok my parents are retarded. i am trying to understand chores as punishment and all but at least know what you are talking about.   first off it was $100.00 i had to pay back to them. ok understnadable i guess. so w/e.   they made up a chore list for me to "pay it off". ok. at this point i will do ANYTHING to get my phone back so i can at least talk to people who don't have their heads up every ass they can find. not only that but my connection to ANY SANITY WHAT-SO-EVER is from my cell phone. w/o it life is seriously hell, sadly.   ok so anyways...so i am looking at the chore sheet and i wanna get these things done. so i look at the price- suddenly its a fucking $187.68 dollars to start times 3. so i am now paying over $300.00 fucking dollars in work.   ok if you haven't been keeping track- i owed them $87.68 for my last phone bill in text messages and AIM. o and by the way...I PAID THAT BACK WITH MY OWN FUCKING MONEY!! but now i stole that too?!?!?!?!?!?!?! FUUUUUUUUCK YOOOOOOOOOOOOOU! i am not a klepto maniac ass holes!!!!  now after fighting with my fucking retarded mother i have 3 options to pay this fucking money back: #1) an hour and 1/2 of work a day for 33.33 days #2) 2 hours a day for 16.65 days #3) 3+ hours a day for 11.22 days  ok first problem- 16.65 days and such is a non-existant # ass holes. second off there is no way IN HELL i am not getting my phone bill back for a month+ because you are irresponsible fuck heads who can't keep track of over 100 thousand dollars that you leave lying around in a hotel room. and 3rd off, i never go down like this w/o a fight so be prepared for a holy-hell out and out war.   o and to the disgrace i sadly have to call "father" (for now on it's joe. he deserves NO respect at all) be prepared for a couple hundred dollar phone bill coming soon. and o yeah- putting me in a "home" is not an option. maybe if you knew how to take care of things such as um, your children maybe, this would have never been a problem to begin with. and YOU are the one who is an ex-AA member and scitsophrenic (sp?)...um yeah  and "mother" *cringe* just wait. i can't wait to see the look on your face when you see the truth behind EVERYTHING!!! i hate you with a passin. never come to me with your petty pathetic problems again. i don't care.  ...still think just because you have money life is perfect and all that bull shit you people keep telling me? wanna trade for a day? i bet you that $200.00 dollars you wouldn't and if you did you would regret it...

      ok so last night sucked.   i feel like i had 10 minutes of sleep because it was too fast and i went to bed too early and that always feels like crap the next morning.  i missed the bus even tho i was out there on time. she was early. no lie...by 3 minutes actually....  all that explains why i am writing this at 6:40 am  its one of those days where when you wake up and if someone even says "hi" you just want to cry your eyes out. same thing with last night. it started out so fun and went straight to hell so naturally, i cried and now, this morning, my eyes are puffy (i hate that) and bloodshot. i look like i was smoking up or something.

      When the day is long and the night, the night is yours alone, When you're sure you've had enough of this life, well hang on Don't let yourself go, 'cause everybody cries and everybody hurts sometimes  Sometimes everything is wrong. Now it's time to sing along When your day is night alone, (hold on, hold on) If you feel like letting go, (hold on) When you think you've had too much of this life, well hang on  'Cause everybody hurts. Take comfort in your friends Everybody hurts. Don't throw your hand. Oh, no. Don't throw your hand If you feel like you're alone, no, no, no, you are not alone  If you're on your own in this life, the days and nights are long, When you think you've had too much of this life to hang on  Well, everybody hurts sometimes, Everybody cries. And everybody hurts sometimes And everybody hurts sometimes. So, hold on, hold on Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on Everybody hurts. You are not alone

      Everyone seems to be having a fairly shitty day. well that makes me feel better because i know how they feel. this weekend has been crap...  you know how you say "when i get out of this house things are going to be different. i will be happy and live my life the way i want. there is no way in hell i will be like my parents..."? yeah well lets just hope that we actually stick to that because i know that if i end up anything like my parents (saying things such as: "you are the worst child ever" and "you stole it. i know you did because you are a horrible person" and things like "i am going to keep you back in 8th grade until you get better grades because at this point you are nothing but a moron" etc.) remind me to send my kids out to a better family and hopefully i will notice that i am like that when i have my first child so i only screw up one life instead of 2 or 3 or 5 or w/e. seriously.   people just suck

      well my fucking parents wouldn't let me go to the fucking mall with fucking kristin because they fucking suck. i fucking have cleaned my room for a fucking 3 days and get jack-fucking-shit for it. everything with my parents has so many fucking strings attached to it and i fucking am not taking it anymore! i am sure kristin would have happily picked my ass up if she wasn't already at the fucking mall already. FUCKING GAH! so yeah i am cursing my fucking ass off because the whole rucking reason for me not fucking going is because i said the fucking "f word" too many fucking times and because they made up some fucking bullshit story about me fucking stealing $100 dollars and even if i did, what do you exspect you fucking ball-fucks? if you leave over one hundred thousand dollars (in $100 dollar bills)in the fucking hotel room un-fucking gaurded the least of your problems are the fucking maids! you fucking whore-butt-dumb-fuck-monkeys!! where the fuck did i learn it from douch-bag ass-hole douch-licks?! HA! now i can curse you fuckers off and you'll never even fucking see it!  MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!! thanks  o and thanks parents for raising your children to be just like you: pot-head convicts.   I SWEAR (and you all know its true) THAT I AM THE GOOD CHILD!! HEL-LOOOOOO!!!!  i don't do drugs, i am not a whore, i get alright grades (i can do better tho and i swear i am trying), and i used to do it all for you! now i am doing it so i can go to college and get the fuck away from you! immaculata- hell no. mom, get your own damn education there and while your at it fuck a nun!   i don't think i have ever felt this good before...

      now there are some things i am glad i was told and other things that i wish i wasn't.   the appearance "issue" is not really an issue though i was hoping it  really  wasn't. above all i wish that i could make my mind believe that.  i realized that there are some things that are going to have to change before it comes time to really happen.   i have to mold you and a few things need to be changed but they are nothing drastic but i won't let them happen. ever.  i feel a little lied to.  i am sorry that i am putting this in my blog. :'(  just don't be mad....

      PICKING UP KAILEE IN 5 HOURS!!   damn that sems like a really long time...eeeeeh!  anyways so i was walking in the hallway and this foreign kid was talking. it was insane and i had to stop myself from laughing. he was like (note:said in a autralian-mexican-british-where the hell did you come from- accent) "o yeah so the chicks they love me here. i am like 'woah ladies you have to back off. there is enough to go around' IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!! hahaha" hahahahaha it was so good. what a loser. HAHAHAHA.   yeah and today is going to be so weird. i don't know why but i feel like it is. my room is a mess and i feel bad for not having kailee see a claner room (not like she gives 2 shits or anything) and i have nothing planned and last time we played the sims for like 7 hours straight. i dont know. we both have changed and now i dont know what we like at the same time. thing is we have always been really close and we ALWAYS like the same things, 600 miles appart or not, and we always have fun, but this time its going to be so sketchy. its been 2 years since i have seen her. thats her going through 3 boyfriends (from 0-3 makes a big difference) and before she never really had any. i went from 15 boyfriends to having none for over a year. matt changed her so much and it scares me kind of. we always enjoy eachothers company but even between all that there were fights between us. the sweet kailee i was BFFs with for 5 years is no more. i need to get to know the new her. this is not going to be as easy as i hoped...who knows? maybe it will be...

      someone comented about that bass and the under the sea thing...well my answer to that is that you are retarded. not all fish live in the same place. like sharks- they can only live in salt water...bass live in fresh water and the ocean is salt water and so therefore they can not play the brass if they can't even BREATHE!!! and so i am back to my original question that NO ONE has been able to answer. i'll just leave it as a lost cause.  o and thanks for not leaving a name.

      yep thats right. today officially started summer vacation...yet it has been so crappy well sorta....  i went to get my hair cut. it is REALLY SHORT but i like it. i know i know. i said i would NEVER get my hair cut again but as i thought i would, i lied. my last haircut just sucked. this one is very me...i think i also got hair dye. i am going dark brown with whitish-blonde hilights. i think it will look good. it did on the dude on the box. (probably my first mistake right there)  on the way home my mom and i of course got in a fight over making green tea cold nad how i told her that it is just not quality (don't ask) and of course she didn't see my point....thats not so unusual. then we got in a fight over how she is my dad and brothers bitch but she will never believe me. my sister and i have both told her about that but she will never listen. i am really not surprised. i guess that is what i get for being honest. so-o-o-ory. she then joked about it with my dad. this was the convo: mom: HA HA mallory says i am your "bitch" dad: *grumble* thats ridiculas mom: so what do you want: lemonade or water? ice with that?  um HELLOOOOOOOOOOOO! thats how the convo went. ok mom, your not his bitch...riiiiiight.   people might actually try listening to me. i may only be a dumb-blonde 16 year old girl with a B-C average but i have common sense, something my parents strongly lack...

AGAIN!!!! what the freaking hell?    french- i def. screwed up on that final like no other.   like i said...rough. thank god we got out at 10 so now i have to go to emm's graduation. snore? who knows. oy vei

       French:  went to the lab. nothing exciting  Math:  went for a while then went to guidance to change my AP Bio to Chem. i got out a little early but too late to go back to class. i just walked around the halls, slowly until i met up with dan and went to SAT  SAT:  boring. we were put into groups. none of us really knew anything from the "games" she gave us. it was crap. we should just be allowed to pick our own groups. hopefull we will tomorrow.  GYM:  LAST DAY OF GYM!! WOOO! we were going to eat food and drink w/e and chew gum and be loud...well we chewed gum and monica brought in food but i just helped al study. it wasn't as great as i hoped. our locker smelled like hippies died in there. nasty...  Lunch  al and i pigged out for w/e reason getting sandwhiches, cookies, chips, and popcorn. it was so good.  English:  i got a 32/30 on my paper- wonderful and a 24/24 on my vocab test- super. i love the grades i get in that class. next year is suposed to be "the hardest course in every grade in every subject" in my counselor's opinion. luckily it's my best subject so i cross my fingers but not too tightly.   Social Studies:  we played jeopardy. i know NOTHING. ss final- yeah gonna fail. greeeeeaaaaat. what can i say? doyle is just the worst teacher in the entire world. and he teaches my worse subject. go him. i wish he transferred sooner instead of torturing me this year. lucky me. my name is proving to be true.   Science:  ok here we go- we have had about a week and a few days to work on this project. anna and i pretty much do..well everything. PJ, mark, and sal have a hard enough time telling their mouths from their asses. all hope was lost there and i knew that once she said "i am assigning groups for this class" that sal was gonna be one of them (it's my name, i swear) ok so anyways...yeah he had to make 2 graphs. just  2 . it took him all of 4 days in the time it took everyone to be completly finished. greaaat. (before he also had to being in the poster board and he brought in a TINY paper. he's an ass) anyways...so then he had to to a plankton chart. nothing  real  difficult but common, it  is  sal. so then yesterday, the day before it was due, i said at the end of class- "sal is it done?" him: "yeah" me: "print it out then and we are done. i can take it home and just glue eveything down" him: *fuss and cry about it because he is a fucking spoiled moron dick face* me: "fine, ass hole. don't i am telling her that if we fail it's your fault" so then i stay after school to finish everything else. he gets mad today because i didn't tell him. jesus christ! i can't rely on you anyway. i HATE you. i'll do it myself! i saved a space b/c the way he showed me was that it was a whole page long. kristin and i spent time organizing it so it would fit....he printed it out in ss, the period before the class, and hands it to me. its a god damn paragraph long!!! DIE!! ok so then i give him shit and he stands right up against me *my skin curls* and yells at me.   i then walk up to reed and SIMPLY ask to see my grade. when i get back to my seat he says "what was that all about?" ok so then i flipped holy shit and was like "i don't have to tell you a god damn thing! i went to see my grade, fuck head. you suck! leave me alone and don't talk to me EVER again". it felt SO good. no regrets. he should be slapped and i mught just do it. i HATE him!!! grr. so then reed says "you might as well not put it on there and just hand it in w/o it. it will count as more point deducted if i have to pull it out and you hand it in later today. it was due in the beginning of class." waaah. again, i hate him. i better get at least a B and she better notice that it was  his  fault otherwise i will personally make sure he knows it...

      o man. that SAT dictionary was one pain in the ass. it took FOREVER! the pics were easy to find tho thank god. i found 2 more than i had to even! lovely  then i wrote this doyle paper. that was crap.omg. i felt like a lawyer talking about all the amendments that have to do with prosecution and such and i almost shot my face off. it ended up being 3 more paragraphs than i needed and it took me maybe 20 minutes. not too shabby. i better get a good grade on it but knowing doyle i will get a C or something b/c i told him i hated him to his face. he asked! i am just honest.   yeah then before that i saw my sisters ballet (very good) and went out to eat with my aunt dawn, aunt denise, g-ma, and my mom. it was fun.we ate A LOT and talked A LOT adn if you think i talk a lot then i want you to meet my mom's family. my head hurt afterwards... haha. anyway. they all know about michael. well isn't that dandy?   i knew nothing about what my mother is telling peopleand now i know. not telling her ANYMORE!  yeah my g-ma was like "so do you ever think you are gonna see your boyfriend?" hahahaha! (well at least she called him my boyfriend)and i told her about kailee's mom and what she was planning and she was satisfied with it. thats all i can ask for.  then somehow we got on the topic of underwear. haha i love my grandmom. and yeah she was like "thongs. do you wear those? they seem comfortable." well shes 1/2 right. haha. she went on about the way panty lines are ugly and if you are fat you might as well not wear any at all. hahahaha. shes great.  thats all for now.

      ok so the red wall- took me 4 days to really finish it (2 more days than i planned) and now it is being painted over somewhat  problems with the red wall:   Lines by the ceiling were screwed up   I don't want to take another 2-3 days fixing them  My dad flipped and said I could not get any new stuff if i kept the wall red (apparently b/c it is red that instantly makes me a hooker...yeah i know, what the fuck?)  It looks like freaky PB&amp;J- not even appitizing enough to eat  The paint didn't go on the wall as i hoped  It is/was frustrating as ALL HELL!!!   so heres the deal- i am going to paint it brown like the rest ACCEPT i will keep a large red square around my inspiration for it in the first place- a french painting of 3 guys and umbrellas hahaha. just so I can not completly cave into my dad and give him the satisfaction of letting him "win" and there will still be a reminder of how much work it took me to paint the little fucker. YAY!

MAAAAA-VELOUS!   Thanks to kristin for helping me paint it. lol (your lines were crooked...seriously lol) but it was such a big help.  this morning i was up at 9 and by 9:30 i was painting a room...WTF?!  i am starting to ramble so i am gonna stop now   O YAH  !!

      ok so my mom randomly says yesterday "hey mal, let's go out and get paint for your room...you still wanna re-do your room don't you?"   HELL YEAH I DO!   one problem: my dad says "we'll get you a bed, mattress, frames, paint, new closet but we have to wait till next week b/c of my buisness..."   ok w/e but the problem is that my mom RIPPED APPART my room today leaving it looking like Heroshima in there and leaving it like taht. so dad says wait till next week and you can't wait till even 12:30 the next day! geesh!   so now it looks like hell. ok so now it will stay that way for at least 2 weeks or more consitering they  don't   keep promises (that has to be my family's worse habit) and they take a month to do something that Trading Spaces can do in all of 2 days. i am all for 2 days people.   don't get me wrong, i really want to but my mom drives me up a wall and my dad can't remember anything he says 2 days after he says it...   maybe i should call up some friends to help me with it like i wanted to do 5 months ago...hmmm...

      Ok i haven't updated this thing in...close enough to forever so here are a few things to have you look at in case i forgot...(none of that made any sense at all)   Latest Quiz I Took:          Your love is... by   urlLink  ChibiMarronchan        Your name is...           Your kiss is...    mysterious      Your hugs are...    to die for      Your eyes...    light up a day      Your touch is...    heart warming      Your smell is...    refreshing      Your smile is...    entrancing      Your love is...    everlasting              Created with the ORIGINAL  urlLink  MemeGen  !        I think I like this one better:         Your love is... by   urlLink  ChibiMarronchan       Your name is...           Your kiss is...    breath taking      Your hugs are...    to die for      Your eyes...    burn into my heart      Your touch is...    awakening my heart      Your smell is...    exotic      Your smile is...    entrancing      Your love is...    one of a kind                Created with the ORIGINAL  urlLink  MemeGen  !       &nbsp;   ummmm...ok so the updated news:   I am no allowed to talk to Michael for 3 weeks...and as always I found the loop hole- US mail. though it sucks, it is much better than nothing. Plus Kristin is acting like the spy. HAHA i love it. Anyway, I am not kicking and screaming about it anymore...to be honest, I never really was. Why fight it when you can find GLORIOUS! little loop holes. muahahaha  &nbsp;   I GET MY CELL BACK IN (hopefully) 11 DAYS!!!!!!!!  WOOOOO!!!!! CALL ME OUT THE ASS TO PISS PEOPLE OFF!!!!!!!! (cough cough- parents) WEEEE HOOOOO!  &nbsp;  Blogger changed again...IT'S MAAAAAAA-VEL-OUS! (marvelous). i can change colors of things. AWESOME! 2 thumbs up on the bullets, colors, quote things (i dunno what they to to be honest), the way to add pics and such (soooo much easier).  &nbsp;   Today is looking up!   &nbsp;

      people have been changing things all over the place. how come not one person can stick to one damn thing anymore? first you're cool then you are confusing then you are just plain dumb then you want to be all close and calm again, then you want to try to push it with everything, then you go off the handles, then you are back to me and you want me to be cool and calm like i was in the beginning. if you didn't fuck things up in the first place then i wouldn't have to stop and be calm again. HELLO!!!

      i don't care about you  i don't care about that  i don't care about your problems  i don't care about the next day  i don't care about what you do  i don't care about what you say  i waited for you and i am tired of it. i am going to be pissed and i am  going to get worried and there is nothing you can do about it. don't try to change it. i'll do that myself. that's why this is lasting only a few hours but HELL i need to blow off some steam and think about things...don't like it? I DON'T CARE!

      so last night i got pissed. now this is not ALWAYS twards someone in particular but it just so happens that someone in particular brought this to my attention- the most annoying thing in the world is when someone acts drunk. true, sometimes you really are drunk but if you are gonna fake it at least do it well.   it all went farther when i went to sleep and woke up to a dream i should have not been having in the first place. that didn't exactly make my day but o well.   my brother wants me to go bowling with him and 2 other people who i will not mention at this point. first i have to get this bull shit figured out before i do anything.   ugh

      ok so i LOVE when people leave me comments. i just have one problem- SAY WHO YOU ARE!!! i know that not all of you have blogger and are WAY too confused about how to leave your name and such but mark it as anonomys (*sp?) and then at the end write "-_____ (your name there!!)" it would be greatly appriciated. thanks so much.

HOLY SWEET JESUS! (so yep, i am going again tomorrow)i yelled at the ref and called him a fatass and i yelled at parents for being..well retarded. what can i say? i hate dumb parents adn i LOVE LOVE LOVE hockey.  then we came back and ate dinner and played wiffle ball. i got 2 home runs and struck timmy out twice. YEAH BITCH!  timmy still won. HAHAHAHA we let him *wink* hehehe  now i am spending the whole weekend with the ridays. YAY! what can i say? gotta go where the love is!

        Wherever you are for the next two months will immediately turn into an exciting place, due in no small part to the fact that you're in an assertive, charming mood. Be bold. Let loose and just do it.  --Does this mean that if I want to go streaking I should let loose and just do it? hmmmm

        ok so instead of me calling mike after 10 when he gets home from work he called me at 10am to wake me up  i slept again till 2pm  i got up and got dressed at around 6:30  i will brush my teeth and wash my face at around 7:15ish  i will eat at 7:30-later   it may not seem like it but to me everything is backwards. start from the bottom and work your way to the top--thats my morning. and the stuff inbetween--who the hell knows     thanks for reading my completly random, once thought out, gone to hell, pointless blog entry. i hope you enjoyed it as much as i don't. mehe
