       i doubt there is an end to the road, because it will always turn, and continue back into different branches of country, crosses road thats been driven. maybe sometime, in the days i have enough money to do what i want , i will travel the road , looking for the end.              i'd take a nice acoustic-electric guitar and get out on the road in a van. live like a Neo-hippy. life would be nice, without people constantly telling me what to do. i could just sleep when i felt like it. drive all night, sleep all day. sounds fun yeah?            but for now life is orders and labor.

       It seems like women aren't looking for a gentleman theses days. That makes me old fashioned. i was brought up to be a gentleman damnit. For some reason every girl i'm polite with thinks i'm trying to do something with them. This is not really a good hting either. Which leads me to ask myself what it is i am supposed to be. Maybe i should move to japan, than when i don't speak japanese and i am gentlemanly to the japanese women they will just think i'm an ignorant exchange student. that sounds good. i could definately do that. i just don't liek the whole  "asia / sars" deal.          Quite A Quandry.                   The Strokes : is this it?

      i could write a letter to no one , and everyone would be able to find something linking to them. It's kinda like Miss Cleo (and other "phsycics") do, say vague comments that could apply to anyone. Then after you hear these comments and i predict something will happen and you would be more alert for it.   I say: You'll Find something New and Interesting, which will strongly influence your decisions.  You See: A new flashy car, which makes you decide you need a new car.                  dumb, i know, but still thats gonna happen to someone.

      the title speaks for itself, because i am not explaining it. Zen statement of the day: "yeah , chicks are for fags!" does anyone else feel that everyday they do something that will send them to hell? ok, so its not just me little kids can be racist, this Black chick (9 yrs old maybe)  yelled "HEY KRACKA!" at me as i was riding my bike through south end, :) wow  america is wonderful.          White Stripes: Girl, You have no faith in medicine                      ^^^^scope it ^^^^^

      Came out Nowhere, but hey its starting to take my better likings. Now remember the 90's? music kicked ass in the 90's. no one really held back because HEY the world was gonna end in 2000. that was a well thought through theory, well we've reached 2000, there's no where else to go i guess  END. nobody can count to 2001, ran out of apples.   I'm watching TV forget what i'm told, i am to0 young and they are too old, take the next bus to catch the next train, i try but you see its hard to explain.       Things America should Consider:     1.banishing Rap music, sorry dawgs, but that shit is so easy it hurts.     2. Making a women president, come on fella's i'm pretty sure i'm not the only guy who realizes we aren't the most clever of 2 genders    3. lowering the price of redbull, my wallet hurts after i stop to get gas at the Kum&Go    4. converting from fossil fuel to hyrdogen fuel cells.     5. giving the family guy more funding.

      Dookie = A+B where dookie is C , A is dook, & B is ie. there for A+B=C    in which case , if D is "s of hazard"  A+D= E , E=Dooks of Hazard. spelled wrong, but still fun.

      sunburn is entirely rude, it wakes me up in the middle of the night and not for a party. rude.   Today's statement of Zen: i can do complete thoughts!                                              -Nick Daly if i may recomend music, not that any one will listen,          Radio head - Creep   when i would fall, i'd look you in the eye, your just like an angel your skin makes me cry.   well, today my rants and raves will be short, goodnight pointless city.
