      The  "KOIYAN"  was deviced by the "thinking" club in the dark forbidden lanes of Chennai. How cruel of nature to not let "US" consummate..and why just the KOIYAN's  With all puffed chest, I spark the "Anti-Koiyan" campaign.  Dear reader you will have to go through this word all throught the blogs ... cant help it though ..its in my blood Hail anti-koiyan,  How positively passive-aggressive of me to have posted this. More revelations of Koiyan in the upcoming blogs.

      Was it the rain or just the rude auto guy whome i asked for directions!!! came saturday, every atom in my body was ready to go for the (fireo motorock) atleast thats what the news paper said. and there was not even a touch of "ROCK" in what i heard at palace grounds that day.  When was the last time you felt like you were naked and sliding over a blade edge?it was 2 days back for me. It was raining all evening and bone chilling cold, but then this Music bust wanted more and I go all alone(to be noted) 26KM ( check out the urge) through Bangalore traffic to listen to "ROCK"  It pays off ...the trouble the passion the hmmmm..evry thing pays off  WARNING: Rest of the blog may contain words or meanings which could be disturbing, and any memoirs of "nighmares" is merely  coicedental also the writer takes no responsibility to the medical and emotional after effects(call me on 9886464668) PLEASE DONT SUE ME ...(leon if u or any of the guys happen to read this)  boy that was a sad,..just ignore the previous mumbling  So here I was at the entrance and I could hear the base thumping through, didnt even bother to park the bike properly, i rush myself to the gate just to realise the music that was being played it went from the sublime to the ridiculous...HINGLISH ROCK where is the good music, RSJ are u there .....? that was a sad attempt to segue to the following...  All I find there was a universal gettogether for the "KOIYAN's" and watch them flaunt to death about their flashy clothes and  non-existing knwolege of "good music".Thsese "Koiyans" are the prissiest, but then thier clothes do churn your tummy at times.  They start moving forward when the band ( hmmm can't even pronounce their name .. agreed by the lead for the band too, ON STAGE) started playin "this aint song for the broken hearted ... taing.. taing .. tung tung tungggg tung" ,no malice intended here.  By the grace of my fore-fathers good deeds, just when i went for a fag and chips, the rain GOds felt "enough is enough" ,It started POURING ..first vision that came in my narked mind was..Macaulay Culkin doing the  "NOW EAT THIS" in MJ.. gee it s fun to see others, all drenched and shivering running haywire when u  puff to glory and yes munch into the "classic salted" chips all this by the warmth of the tea and shade of the covers above you (did i say i have horns and a tail with arrow head)   Then there was this friend of mine who had no other word than "F#$*" in his vocabulary,  though it was preceded or vice versa with one of your ancestral names oh and the group of highly safosticated "DUDes" who thought the "duds" who were on stage were "Moksha",when all the while some demented freak band was playing the Rock version of a sanskrit sloka in a high falsetto. Well there was a feel good factor though "babes" .. but the saga comtinues, the "KOIYAN's" sweep em all.  All wet and shivering  and satisfied after Swearing at innocent musicians who didnt play , just because they loved their life and didnt want to die electricuted in front of a bunch of "KOIYANs",  or instead the lead singer could have gone back to chennai and said.. "well no more MOKSHA the rest of them got fried till their jocs, trying to play a tribute for the KOIYANs"  I drive through the mud and dirt back abode to listen to some Kobain in sankars ancient MP3 player. alas my rock thirst bilogical cells  atleast get get to tell each other brrrr.. "dine with the devil".

      Happy birthday another of my " FAT "friend( no malice intended here ) and "FAT" is a conjecture with refference to some of my friends, the quaint method to insult someone,no not for me. I have always loved the ones on the ,kaushik ishtyle of quote(all about him latter in the bickering)...."  A little on the  MUSCULAR   "...side, to stike off four names that are ettched to my brain. Read on ....and keep in mind I Love them all,  1)BIJOY(1989-1992)   height:short then ..dont know now   weight:then- was no concern, but had never let him play crocodile-race as my                 partner,esp when i had to carry him.          now - NO IDEA Kendriya Vidyala Naval base, Cochin. Class of grade-3, Bench 4th from the front, {Anoop[intro]:}A new-comer timid,adventurous and all alone,....{Bijoy:[intro]}....The first person to come and smile at  me was  10 times..hmm 6 times bigger than me yobo and it looked like he was going to browbeat me, atleast that was what  I thought. Ended up the best of pals.We used to exchange cards ,penned "To my dear Brother..". I still remember he gifting me a pawn supposed to be made out of marble.When 10yrs old it was a venerated posession. I lost it ,though i have the birthday card he gave me the same year. After his dad, a naval officer ,got transferred, BIJOY got embedded in my LTM.  2)ASHWIN PAI alias Twinkle PAI(1997-1999)   height:average then..dont know now   weight:then- plumpy 	 now - musta reduced (ass H&*^* mail me..) Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Cochin. Class of grade-12, Waiting in the assembly. {Anoop[intro]:} Why the *#$* am I here...{Ashwin pai:[intro]}... NON EXISTING The year 1999 did bring about a lot of changes, to mention, Going to school in a BOAT.one of the most scenic mornings you can ever think of, aaah to start the day with aesthetically pleasing backwaters and sunrise (dishum....my school used to start at 7 in the morning) that was the greener side of my memoirs ,definitely (I will write a  drivel on my puerility days in Willingdon Island). I get to know this plump,chweeet,ruddy Ashwin through "Parameshwaran sir's" tution ,rather than as a class mate,latter benchmate. He was not fat though ,but his tummy could have made a sub for my punch bag(not that i had one) Admirer of "Tinkle" comics( note the year please.. ahem age please ) and hence the alias. Me,Sankar and tinkle "used to be good" chumps(Ashwin please read the quotes, if you still alive u FAT TWINKLE reading dud,you make me do this all the time,HO-hum.  3)KAUSHIK alias FATSO alias KAU(2004-tilldate).   height:6ft..and still growing (horizontally hehehe).   weight:then- cannot divulge here(Kau i keep the promise).          now - hail unswerving Anoop. Came as a storm ,but that was only the semblence,de facto zephyr. I ll never forget the "wall slam" on my Bday he gave me (to explain the agony ill have to disclose the fortofied "weight" factor) Staunch me (kau you listening....get that bottle of Tequila for me) and i will get back to you for that some time. And the "No fear" T is still me favourite. habituated HOGGER ,soulful,definition of "lie through your teeth" ,brag about his so called muscles ,fiery underpants and more ....  I love you Kau ....hope i m alive when you stop vaunting. Please dont lose weight ...half my property for you ..please  4)Vittal Happy Birthday .. have more obese days and make me proud.  My  mentation tells me that the "FAT" ones in my life has always been the cute, loving ,toteup "FAT rocks dude" Now why did i start ..ah...   flabs... bitch tits... thunder thighs... what the heck the earth holds me..

      It happened out of the blue.At first I was dubious then skepticism creeped in but then it was too late for any kind of quelch.The news was out " urlLink  Creed   has  DISBANDED ". Some bad news come as a storm but then there is always hope of a new sprout ,a new begining after every disaster. Next time we'll hear the deep mellifluous voice and highly vehement compositions ,may be some time when the band does the "One Last time we ll do it together AGAIN" concert ,and god knows when!  A heavy hearted FAN signing off.  ....Cos when you are with me ,I m free ,I m careless ,I believe....

      3 days away from the aboninable sound of tapping on the key board, ( the 3 day week end was a "operation success", the commando operation deviced in this pudding-head...BUNKED  work with the excuse of Bad tummy ) a long restful week end.All this I consider a treat for myself, question of whether meriting or not has no relevance here.  Its like the first breath of air after you dive 30 feet deep ..whoaa the gush the relief,what an anology   started the week end in a pretty shakky way, friday evening and ,my brain cells were annulled by the bangalore taffic ,and then to add to my agony "I PRESENT TO YOU ..the man who crosses the road blind", damn i felt like running him down.  and there he was the mirthful "RAJ" himself, i think that is what i wanted after having such a disastrous day.  The string of events start from then, for the next 2 days i slept 9 hours (i dont believe it) ,though it was made up to on  monday, when things were happening so fast i ll have to brain storm to recollect the wierd things we did 1)stay awake and entertain each other with prosaic ghost stories, though a few of us did get spooked. me too me too.. when it turned out that there was no power in the house, what a conjunction.  2)Do the "Wall trip" all nite and freak every body, and hoodwink them into believing that they were "DEAD".... paramapara .. i m a GOD man now "the man who conquered death".  3)Play B-ball after night out--every body had their eyes closing even before they said "i'm sleepy".  There were more to add but amnesia has taken over,who can avert the obviate. Monday revitalised me ,13 hours of sleep and a dainty "MALLU" lunch to top.  Wish just wish they would pay me the same lump of currency to just sit in "Shiva MESS" or "Achaayan MESS" and  treat my taste buds to the full,ah ah ..wait or I could just jump of the building and drift like a feather ,float down to the lap of that beautiful lady I saw at "KABAAB MAGIC" or just walk on one hand till the whole world follows me...fataaak... u can do a better hallucination than that Anoop.

      Mentioning a few roses and bricks of my experience with the "PICKLE". Please do not expect any expert, adept recipe or assistive thoughts here to make your culinary experience more gracious.  Read on the drivels of a food faddist. I recall, those huge satchels I had too carry to hostel after a house visit. Mummy's special, Granny's love, aunt's compultion, neighbors’ threat.... and many more in the menu. All of them, collage of exotic spices, chili, oil, vinegar ummm and.. and ..can’t remember, my short term memory always betrays me damn.  Eat them in groups hiding from the seniors or threaten the freshies and grab em, any day any time any where is "PICKLE" time.  I had the pleasure of, staying in all the four south Indian states and taste the different “PICKLES”. Let me put the whole story in an ordered way. _________________________________________________________________________________________  1.PLACE: ”Ochira” (Maternal house)   ACTOR: "Vaasanthi"(my umma umma granny)   PS: “umma” is kisses in mallu, though one reference is enough, I am a little   extravagant in Granny’s case. _________________________________________________________________________________________  Rewind 9 years, eveninig, the huge sack of miniscule mangoes collected during the week is at last ready to be sorted and readied for their last divine trip, in to those HUGE pickle barrels. That evening it is a regale for all the kids, I ve lost count of how many, I used to hate sharing with mallu, shallu, kannan, nandu, ammu, marrarikullam madhavan nair (yes that is a name, and of my 3 year old cousin) in the house. With the constant squalling from the elders we manage enough of the ripe ones to be relished with salt and chili powder. Don't know how it is done but then after 3 days of "Operation Pickling", they are sealed tight (not tight enough for us) and stacked into the dark and dismaying storerooms. We get to taste them "officially" only latter ..long after, till then the reserve Barrels from the past years fill our “PICKLE” needs.  Red in color they can tingle your tungee for 2 litters of water (when I was 13). Vaasanthi used to love seeing us kids run around in search of water bodies with the tongues hanging out loathly, now I can settle for a glass, to Vaasanthi's dismay. My personal fav is the ones doused in vinegar and salt, even I can make it.  Apart from the foretell, after every incident I will give away my well-kept and exotic recipes to the readers one by one. These were passed down to me from my forefathers and contain the secret to success of many chefs and hotels. Please don’t pass it around and spoil its divinity.  Presenting to you "Recipe de exotique pickle au Anoop". YOU NEED: 1) Tiniest mangoes (nos-your need). 2) Vinegar (till u get drunk... kiddding. Just a little bit). 3) Container. 4) Cloth (to tie the mouth of the container). HOW TO MAKE IT: Clean the mangoes thoroughly, don’t cut them. Drop them one by one into the container with lot of salt and vinegar, SLOWLY. Count them for amusement. Tie the mouth with the cloth, very very tight; even Vaasanthi should not be able to open it. Wait for ages and let your great-grand children eat them and get drunk.  Look amma your boy can cook  PS: Author is not responsible for any medical complications or death. _________________________________________________________________________________________ 2.PLACE: SRM Engineering College, Hostel MESS-2.   ACTOR: Anoop MohanKumar. _________________________________________________________________________________________  College days are to be remembered, coincidence this incident feature our HERO "Pickle" but in a completely different advert "OORUGAI".....(had to ask that to a Tamil friend of mine, even now). So, fresher in the canteen, my turn to collect the paapad and help myself with sumptuous Pickle (last time reference), but alas the bucket was missing, which prompted me to ask a simpletons question "Anna pickle engai"(where is the pickle). The inevitable happened, a sudden hush fell over, a bees buzz would have enounced thunder, all the mess boys and the "Master-Mathiazhagan" (Head chef) turned to me and stared, not knowing what was wrong, this dolt repeats the question "Anna pickle engai".... Note: The referral "mess-BOYS" don’t do any justice to the physique of those guys. I still get nightmares, and am daunted by those stares.  One of the "BOYS" came close to me, smell of sweat, raw cut vegetables,  the tanned skin from the furnace,  it was just him and me, the silence was killing, with a tooth-pic squelched in his mouth, the deep and shivery voice ask me "ne ENNA solai...?"(What did say).  Before the shots were fired. from the back of the queue, the savior came "give him the '  OORUGAI '...." and from nowhere the bucket of pickle remerged, pooh what a relief. Till date I’m proud to have withstood that onslaught by the pickles oops " OORUGAI ".  Presenting "Recipe de merde Mathiazhagan"(don’t bother look for English of "merde", not worth it)  HOW TO MAKE IT: You don’t want to know. YOU NEED: Mangoes (supposedly), and lot of other things only Mathiazhagan knows and you’ll never want to. Those days “medre athiazhagan pickle” used to be our best pick in the menu , and thank you HEAD CHEF.   PS: No harmful side effects. Turns you into a capable soul to survive any cuisine anywhere, even the Satyam canteens. ________________________________________________________________________ 3.PLACE: Varun Reddy's Residence.   ACTOR: Aiyo Anoop Again. ________________________________________________________________________ After a hard days work (you do that when u join first in a company, latter on u learn the tricks), I am looking forward to meeting Varun and pamper myself on the exuberant dinner he has promised me. Ocassion-Vijayadeshami.I could smell food from the doorstep, my tummy avid. Starving since morning was paying off. All that was to change. Thanks to my short-term memoirs, I will refer to the dishes except our hero, as X, Y, Z, a, b, c. We started the meal with a serving of X, which was great, then jump on to Y oooohh, and then came a large serving of Z again ummma, a, b and c came after that ....wha kya meal tha I went home a contented man with a temporary paunch.... and lived happily ever after. NOOOO that was not to happen, did I forget to mention X, Y, Z, a, b, c every thing even the water came along with our hero "THE PICKLE".  What is with these Golties (no malice indented here), please refer to the meaning of Pickle in the dictionary it says " (a sauce made from) vegetables or fruit which have been preserved in a vinegar sauce or salty water:". It’s vinegar..baba ….vinegar ..Not 15 KGs of red-hot chili.  I remember the next day, I spend in the toilet. Dreadful days are not worth remembrance, so no more details on that. But I realized that, with all the pain and trauma I went through I still like the “PACHADI” A pickle with a tickle............... That was the best pickle I ever had and there is no vis-à-vis for it, and never will be. Hats off. "Een jesnaaru saru .. oka manchi pachadi cheyi" for the ordinary Human.(excuse my telugu)  Presenting "Reciep de chaud au Valsala aunty"  HOW TO MAKE: Please call 09886464668. YOU NEED:    Please call 09886464668.  WARNING: Do you want me to explain more of my days in the loo.....common  ___________________________________________________________________________________ 4.PLACE: Some where in Bangalore.   ACTOR: Anoop and the unknown crusader (just for the effect) ____________________________________________________________________________________ New in Bangalore, look out for the life sustaining, pleasing, most wanted, something every verile, anthropoid dude wants.. no no .. not the babes, we are talking about food here..  food. I see a restaurant at the corner of the street. Looks decent enough, pretty crowded (Now the babes come into picture). I decide to entertain my taste buds there. Still remember the restaurant name "some saagar”, kudos’ to my short-term memory.  Ordered lunch (mini meals) south Indian. Every thing is fine, even the price tag. The food is good, it is tasty and served clean enough But then something is missing (5 Rs for guessing what)..Our Hero "Upinna Kai". On request the waiter got me a small bowl of "Upinna Kai", the look of it reminded me of my fish tank with the "gold fishes “swimming around. The bowl substituted the tank and the "Gold fish" raw pieces of mango; the water was the same only for the color, RED. Bangaloruuuu give me the best "Upinna Kai", that’s a dare ( Especially, girls who are single, have no parents at home, preferably settled in Bangalore )    My encounters with our hero will continue in different forms and names, and hopefully I will get to drivel about them more some time latter. If there is one person reading this and has not tasted "PICKLE" please get a cup of water and drown yourself, for if there is a GOD, then his/her second name is  " P. I. C. K. L. E ".   Bone apetite and happy pickling. Anoop

       Painting:   second name of Anoop, the only stress releaser.  Critics go to hell.    Blah Blah:   I am adicted.  &nbsp;  Friends:  Can't survive without them. My only float in troubled waters.   Girls:   No No no NOOOOOOOOOOOOO...  execpt Vids.No regrets on what happened, never will.  After all you have the good memoirs.  The whole episode did teach me how to take "HURT".   picture this,... Juicy FAT watermelon squelched with a sledge hammer....  I know how it feels on the melons side.    Smokes and alco:   Foot ball without the "CAN" ..it's like swimming with no legs.  Nicotine is not necessary, can live with the occasional inhalations.  After all u have to live in today's world, Pollution outside and INSIDE(excuse the obtuse).  I have a better excuse, "EVERY BODY DIEs, SO WILL YOU"(apretiate the plagiarism).    Laziness:   I am I am I am, seems as a foetus I didn't even kick my moms tummy.

      Late post&nbsp;to commemorate another " day " , reminds me that I'm running out if time. My birthday is done with for the 23rd time. was home&nbsp;when the day started, ended up in a " kallu shaap " (local&nbsp;toddy shop) by the evening. I was decieved into the place by my mentors back in cochin, Vasanth and Girish chettan. when vasanth asked me to come home fast ,I thougth there s a surprise&nbsp; party waiting for me (even told vidya, I'm goin to be surprised with a party, yes she called )poooh...ya rgth surprise and a party too, but never thougth it's going to be like this in my wildest dreams. &nbsp; The  "kallu shaap"  was located by the river XYZ, and it looked beautiful with the moon light bouncing of the ripples made by the " vallam "(man powered boats), cruising through. &nbsp;  "kallu",  &nbsp;suppposed to be one of the purest form of liquor, tasted like Vanilla-shake with vinegar in it,&nbsp;but tasted&nbsp;divine, kinda baffling. To top it we&nbsp;had sumptious servings of  "karimmen porichathu", "meen pollichathu",  prawns fry,  "vedi-irrachi"(crane meet) , i too felt a lil disgust ,thats before I tasted it. &nbsp; The owner of the place,"BABU" was "Girish-Chettans" buddy,&nbsp;he too was on&nbsp;our table, after getting a lil tipsy  he started off with the golden, evergreen songs in Malayalam, Boy it sure feels good to hear it from some one who knows what he's singing. &nbsp; trrrrrrrrrriiiiing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;achan&nbsp;calling ,panic ,cut the song (whoes&nbsp;bothered).....&nbsp;  "anthi kadapurathu oru oola kudayeduthu, naalum kooti murukinajunathu aranu....." &nbsp; blasting in the background, I pick up the call.Told him ill be late and that&nbsp;I have the keys.Told him not to let  "tikku"  out of the kennel till I come ...ya the last thing you want is to get ravished by your own dog ,cos you dont smell like "Anoop" instead stink of  "kallu".    &nbsp; Got home by 1am and amma was still waiting for me, she knew what her 23 year old son was upto and asked me to take a shower and go to sleep.Next day morning I told her every thing, things were cool. Achan also got a brief description of the evening, though i spoke to him&nbsp;only about my&nbsp;clinary satisfactions, I m sure he knows his SON better. &nbsp; And i went to  TWO  temples the next day .................................see how pious I am ,just not a souse. Back to work now . &nbsp; Happy Bday to you .. happy Bday to you .. happy Bday to chupru..... &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  I always thought  "Yoga&trade;"  was another of those martial arts-gimmicks. Left leg up, right hand on you nose, twist your head, bend down to touch the knees, aha....got you, now try and get out of the   "twistero-aasana"  . But then my cogitation changed when I experienced it myself, I became Yogic-Spidiee.  &nbsp;  My first experience with  "Yoga&trade;"  was dire.  &nbsp;  A friend of mine-"Quarter Kumar" told me that his granddad was giving Yoga classes "FOR FREE", and like the usual "Fall for FREE" dud, I took the bait.  Hey and did I tell you readers, I was  3 times champ in "Who can spit highest on the wall"(was suspended in class 4 for the same), ultimate in "hanging upside down till you faint and the macho who could stand on one hand, and still not fall down for a record 2 seconds.   Any way, next day morning at 4, I got up, took a shower and go all the way to Quarter Kumar's house on my cycle.  &nbsp;  There I was on the first floor of the house wearing a loose shorts and T shirt, eyes half closed, saliva driveling from the mouth, not even able to make out if the slender figure in front of me was Quarter Kumar's Grand-dad or a half peeled banana, I wanted to scoot and crash on my cozy bed as soon as possible.  According to my mom, Yoga would help me, tone-up my body and senses, refresh me spiritually, and awaken my inner "gyaan",.......TWAAAANG.... inner what??!!  Mom.... you are talking to the  3 times champ in "Who can spit highest on the wall", ultimate in "hanging upside down till you faint" and the macho who could stand on one hand and still not fall down for a record 2 seconds.  He needs no refreshing the atma or toning the body.... He's " FIT', just like 'Thambi', the drunkard neighbor of ours.  &nbsp;  But then, to keep the school-bully your best pal, I had to go to Quarter Kumar's place.  &nbsp;  Quarter Kumar's granddad was a, short, thin, man in his late 60s(that was 7 years ago). According to Quarter Kumar, his granddad was supposed to posses the divine skills of Yoga, which helped him not have a single white hair even at that age. Well I can do that too, after all what is  "Rose-Brand kaali mehandi"  for.  Intellectually, he was at the penacle. Vedas, mantras he had authored a few books also.  &nbsp;  Quarter Kumar was all enthu about the Yoga session.  Grandpa started off reading a mantra for us and we had to repeat with him, then he asked us to sit up with straight backs and take deep breaths. Straight backs hah .......¦deep breaths haahahhahha, old man you are talking to the  3 times champ in "Who can spit highest on the wall', ultimate in "&oelig;hanging upside down till you faint" and the macho who could stand on one hand and still not fall down for a record 2 seconds.   Please please, give me the big one and save all these for the sissy.  Still the old man did not heed. He went on to explain how to go about doing "Surya-namaskaram", "Surya-namaskaram" and Me pooh "¦the  3 times champ in "Who can spit highest on the wall", ultimate in "hanging upside down till you faint" and the macho who could stand on one hand and still not fall down for a record 2 seconds , was being asked to do one of the easiest Aasana"&nbsp; &Atilde;&cent;"Surya namaskaram". All right, all right I'll do it.  Stood straight, knees straight, hands above my head, bend down........ &nbsp;  .............................  I blacked out ................................................................................ &nbsp;  &nbsp;  When I got up, I was  SPIDERMAN , the friendly neighborhood  SPIDERMAN .  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Note:&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear reader. Anoop lost his humane instincts after that accident and since, has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;been in a mazed state. Please excuse his insane-mumblings.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.    Sign: Grandpa. Still having black hair.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       First of the waves you touch will be the last you feel, now was that the last or the first wave?  Evry single grain under my feet, stimulates me into a cacoethes.  Should I bend down to itch, hah yes itch till every layer under your feet find their way into the salty depths,  and you stand there; still, quiet, feeling the wind through your osseous tissues.Slowly, very slowly till you..you.... don't exist.  The waves touch your feet again,  Is it the first or the last one!!!!   creepy eh, this is what i saw in my sleep yesterday.  amaaaaa I want you here now.  I remember the one time i got my bones chilled, in my sleep when I dreamt a snake chasing me all around the place.  Slept in amma and achan's room that nite (hey.....i was in 6th grade then ok and i don't like&nbsp;' MY ' bed, wet).With the revelation of the dream, I had to do a marathon vist to 3 temples (with snake deities) that week.  If i tell amma about this, where am i going to end up??!!!!!!!  . .. ... .... ..... ...... ....... .

      Week end was just fine.   Was down with " empty your bowel while you sneeze " disease on Sunday. Damn, it's no fun to be in the loo when your buddies are having fun, just a door away.I also missed&nbsp;Sunday treat for myself at a Pub or Restaurant.  The bettter part of my week end, Went to ISKCON (International society for Krishna Consciousness) here in Bangalore, on Saturday.  Got myself a "sandalwood mala" (oh, how I LOVE beads).  I used to don two beautiful mala's during my college, one was tulsi beads and the other, red sandalwood (a cheaper version, and has no smell).  Still have the red-sandalwood one , the other is with   HER  .GOD let a day past by, with me not thinking of   HE  R,pleaaase....  Well abt ISKCON, they serve   PIZZAS for      prasa  d  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;    &nbsp;krishnaaaeeeee.....&nbsp;the elysian, bless us. Pssst.... this time with  chatpatti paneer-extra cheese - stuffed crust ,&nbsp;please.   When Pankaj told me this, before&nbsp;I left for the place, I thought it was another one of his "CRAP".  Blimey, they actually had doughnuts and pizzas with sign-posts saying,"Lord Krishnas Prasad,  Donate  Rs 30/-".  Alrght Commercialized GOD freaks,I preffer " Thripunithura Kshetram " back home.When you want to feel&nbsp;divinity, the smell of Pizza or samosas is not required.   On a postivistic note, super architeture, lovely landscaping, idols were amazingly comely and aesthetic.    PS : I'll love to go there again (even&nbsp;when&nbsp;I&nbsp;am warned&nbsp;of their&nbsp;organ-trading reputation).

      " He's an accomplished champion but he's not invincible ", a cliche.(comment by Race director Jean-Marie Leblanc)    Hats and my " chaddi " off to this man. To win six times in a row one of the most difficult races, is something my grandpa would make me proud of.  urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/cycling/3924971.stm   &nbsp;  urlLink  &nbsp;

      Never wanted to scribble down my personal stuff here (contradicting statement though), always wanted to pen down things of no importance or of absolute nimble value what inspired few of my drivels.But now, if I have to keep my blog updated I'll have to jot down few things that happen every day in this dandy's life.  Last 2 weeks, full of bollywood-style, masala added stunts and emotions, not to forget "the forgotten friends and their re-union"(mithun came down to Bangalore), "apathy of a mother in the hospital"(every day I pray for my friend KK to get well), "elope into the wilderness with the CHICKS( road trip to the great Bunyan with Ashok, sankar, dwipin,tahir( DUDE CONGRATS ON THE JOB ),shabin,ya ya "CHICKS" was just an adjcetive). There is soo much to write and like I said, don't want to encourage personal stuff here.  hey watch out for the "  The bubble gum story  " ..comming soon!(here at chupru.blogspot) (boy now wht the hell will I want to write about a bubble gum??!!, yes I'll write abt the one I swallowed without chewing at the age of 2, and that got stuck in my A*#@ hole, induced super-hero powers in me and I became "FArt man").
