      	I was dancing along a parapet. Leg up, leg down, I twisted gently and spun upon my pointed toes. The boys and girls beneath me smiled and were cheered, because I was dancing upon the parapet, a pointless protrusion of concrete to run along a case of stairs. It was freestanding, and when I stood beside it at the bottom of the stairs I was shorter than it; at the top I was only barely taller. 	I climbed up upon it and I danced, because it seemed a rather good thing to do. People milled about me on the bare concrete quad, looking up or looking down, smiling when they saw me. It was an amusement, and the weather was clear and still. 	I twisted round and caught squarely among my abdominals a large irregular stone. It was nothing like the geometric lines of the square courtyard; roughly hewn and uneven.  	I tipped backwards from the narrow parapet. My leg flew up in a desperate attempt to redistribute my weight; I tipped backwards. It was an endless moment, in which my limbs flew out and I flew back, following the arched center of my spine. The pink ribbons of my shirt drifted toward the sky as I plunged down to the earth. I was not meant to fly.   	People froze and stared, aghast and horrified. My frantic eyes searched the sky for salvation as they stood helpless, too far distant and too weak.  	 	I land squarely in his arms. He had run from nowhere to stand beneath me when I fell, and together we tumble onto the hard cement. We sit up rattled, pushing my long hair from our faces and untangling our jumbled limbs. I gaze about through the mesh of golden hair which crosshatches my vision. The people, broken from their trances, spill around us in waves of color and flesh, imploring our health and applauding his celerity.  	The rock? It came from over there, we say, and in fury and in rage the thrower is sought.  	He rises, and pulls me up after, and we stand bemused as about us pours the raging pursuit of the malingerer. Stop, I say, I am unharmed and also he. They are a mad amoeba without ears, or certainly without the capacity to digest what falls upon them. It is revelry, and a crazed mob, but what do they seek? It is not for my revenge: I will not have it.  	It must be theirs then, for it is none of mine. But why?

      		My cousin wanted her portrait drawn before we left the antique Canadian municipality called Gastown. The streets were lined with gas-burning streetlamps and vendors, selling junk to tourists. It was late afternoon and clouding. 	We found an artist, his watercolors and sketches pinned to a makeshift easel. He was just preparing to head off for the day, but our troupe accosted him and begged that he draw one last portrait. An old man, skinny and white-stubbled, he wore an old army coat and his vehicle was a rundown bicycle. He was frustrated that we had come so late, but was clearly in need of the money and agreed to stay. Early into his drawing the rain broke, and his distress was evident as the drops neared his shabby display of striking paintings.  	This disturbed me too, so that I moved to shield the manâ€™s works with my own jacket. I realize now that what I really feared was that my own art and skills would be banished to such a disgraceful life, to suffer the whims of a selfish girl for a few dollars. It is a horrifying prospect, and I see now that to deter this fate I have to sculpt my own impending lifetime. I try to take advantage of what supplies and time and attention are available to me today, and to search for a career which incorporates my art, so that I need not suffer poverty to do what I love.

      of childhood, perhaps second grade or first. i was alone but i never knew it, so i wasnt lonely really. even so early i fanatacised over style - my pretty dress coat of navy blue boiled wool was my first fashion statement. i wore it always. i hated school. it was so demanding; not the work, which was too simple, but the people, who also were too simple. even so early they played at the games of adults, drama queens and pimps and know it alls. i received my first love note in the first grade room so amply paved with puce coloured carpet from the 60s or 70s. what was i to do, i wondered, with this silly little scrap of paper? i tossed it away, both from my fingers and my thoughts. while other children played kickball, i did little side from contemplate their games and wonder, why? i am a natural athlete. i did not fear to join - what good would it do me, however, to do so? i would construct my own devices for amusement, solo, ignorant to their metaphorical significance to my later life. now i see the irony, in my scorn of games, for i myself partake in them as human nature - though they are yet of my own devising.  much of my concentration focused on the gutter which ran the length of the sparsely vegetated field, burnished raw at the base stops and parched of water here and there.  on overcast days of rain or snow - a happy occurence in my early life -i the gutter child delighted in constructing dams to block the flow of water to the drain, diverting it instead across the blacktop or sending it backward into its own origin. sticks were scarce, no trees having been allowed to take root and thus also depriving the field of shade. a rare commodity and prized for their structural capacity, they were gathered near the edges of the chain link fence, where they clustered in the savage wind, unchecked as it was by any substantial structure but the hulking redbrick school.  a clear day, the water froze along the gutter track, congealing as a thin sheet just suspended over the unmoving stream of gutterwater. i broke it gently with my mitted hands, shattering it like a mirrors surface. even more delicately i lifted the ethereal plates up from their watery bed and set them upon the narrow curb which ran along it. a shadow fell over me here at my work bench, but i did not look up to ascertain its wielder; too frequently did the older children come to watch my strange activities in momentary fascination.  'what are you doing, jen?' asked the shadow maker. i looked up against the sun to see my own mother, come to visit, and my younger brother, not yet in school. he wore his puffy down coat that made him look like a fat blue marshmallow, stupid with his red rosy cheeks and button round eyes.  'i donno,' i think i said, inexplicably embarrassed to be caught alone at my solitary game. i straightened one of the scraps of ice self-consciously, still half kneeling on the asphault.  it was so clear and bright and blue that day.

      in christmas vacation i went to maui. we took surf lessons - who doesnt in hawaii? it was brilliant to paddle around on our boards, and certainly more so the exquisite instructor. damn the luck. the most incredible guy i ever meet lives on an island too many thousand miles away. 'are you a cheerleader?' another instructor asks as i lay prone on my surfboard in front of him; theyre standing. i laugh no, 'a model?' asks my own instructor. 'you guys want tips, dont you?' i laugh back. trailing down his back like medusa's snakes were long sienna dreds, a number of them bleached white as the exalted white sand. they were just skinny, and he had massed them back with a rubber band. i loved them. when i went up to him after the lesson with an obscene tip, he was busy rinsing the coarse golden sand from his reef booties. 'do you have a pocket i can just stick it into?' i asked. he directed me to a small pocket on his thigh, and proffered his leg. 'uhh listen,' he said, 'there is like, a party tonight for new years, its gonna be pretty sweet. wanna come?' so i snuck out in hawaii. i do it at home all the time - is it worse or better while on vacation with the parents? that was the first time id been drunk in a while. we had so much fun that night. it was on a beach, and we splashed and played in the water and by a giant bonfire. there were people everywhere, beercans, surfboards and a million cars in the lot and down the street. ive never had a better new years. kimo was pretty short, only a few inches taller than me (im not small.. 5'6). wiry-muscular and dark tanned, a japanese style tattoo covered most of his lower back. he was hot. we took a sufrboard out (he took it out, i rode) and we surfed blind in the dark, partner style, for a while. i have to say, hawaiian reefs are a little sharp for night surfing. when one of his friends swam out and jumped on the board, scaring the shit out of me and capsizing it, we all went back in to the beach. everybody got wasted on heineken and guinness and tequila.  theres nothing more fun than one night stands in a city thousands of miles of ocean from your home. theres no inhibition of any sort. everyone in hawaii drives a small pickup (if theyre native) or a 2004 mustang (if theyre not). all of the pickups have surfboards layered in the back, and who would have guessed - they double as a mattress. another oddity - 9 inches, 5'8; 5 inches, 6'3. hmm. i guess its true - height has nothing to do with it. drunk and hyper and free, we landed in the back of kimos pickup. most of the cars near us were enjoying similar occupations. theres something inherently sexier about leaving clothes on to do it. it seems so much naughtier, so much more 'my-parents-could-get-home-any-minute-and-catch-us'. we tried it side by side, we tried it missionary, we tried it flat doggy. he wasnt any 'better' than any other guy. the situation was.  afterwards we partied more. he drove me home at four am, and we sat outside my hotel for an hour in the car, knowing we'd never see each other again. its a weird feeling, sitting with a guy youve just met and fucked and know youll never see again. we didnt know whether to laugh or cry. so we had sex again. in the cab of the truck. it was so good, straddling his lap with my hands on his shoulders and his arms around my waist.  i walked into my hotel, into the enormous lobby where the desk attendents looked at me in alarm. i tipped them not to say a word. who actually does that in real life, james bond?

      	I have trouble sleeping. Itâ€™s been a chronic problem that has plagued me since I moved into this house, eight months ago. At first I would be too frightened to leave my bed or even move a muscle for fear of dark-dwelling demons. I would lay for hours in itchy, overheated sweat, hoping my covers would protect me from fearful malingerers. Since then Iâ€™ve learned to listen to music or read a book. Iâ€™ve read a lot of books and watched a lot of terrible late-night TV from my bed.  	I woke up one night at what the red dashes proclaimed as two forty-six A.M. I laid for a few moments trying to go back to sleep, but it wouldnâ€™t come. At last I threw back the covers and slid my legs out of bed. I live alone, so I didnâ€™t bother to put on the sweats thrown over a nearby chair before going downstairs in search of a drink.  	Why is it that that night I wanted a glass of water? Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s never put me to sleep. It was surprisingly cold downstairs. I planned subconsciously to turn up the thermostat in the morning. 	I walked into the kitchen and turned on the halogen light. It takes a while for it to warm up, so it was still pretty dim in the room as I fetched a glass and held it under the tap. I looked out the window in front of me as I waited for it to fill, trying to discern individual shapes from the fuzzy blackness.  	As I left again I happened to glance behind me as I hit the light switch. I thought vaguely that I must put in a normal bulb - the room hadnâ€™t much lightened in the few moments I was there. 	It wasnâ€™t until I was a few steps away that I realized that there was a man in the kitchen, standing against a wall in the corner, his hands folded demurely before him. 	Panic washed my body like a cold shower. I walked through the rest of the dining room, the living room and up to the front door. Tears slid down my cheeks and my hands shook the water from my glass.  	I couldnâ€™t help but run the last few steps to the door, and in my haste to twist open the lock I dropped the glass. It shattered loudly, and behind me I heard an anguished, masculine cry. I watched my hands opening the door, my ears and mind behind me. I sprinted from the house, across the lawn. 	At the nearest neighborâ€™s house I screamed and pounded on the door with my fists. Behind me I heard him coming; I looked - he wasnâ€™t there. I saw a movement in the shrubs beside the porch - he wasnâ€™t there. Screaming and sobbing hysterically, I pummeled the door with my fists until it opened and I fell into the neighbor's arms.  	Two days later a policeman stationed in my house found him in the same place, two fifty A.M.   	The man told the prosecutor he had used my phone every night for seven months to call his grandmother, whom he had smothered to death in this house six years before.

      I was hiding under greenish white flowers, creeping among the stalks. The flowers were held high enough, and splayed wide enough, to shield me from vision like umbrellas. Nevertheless they were indoors, enclosed by a sheath of old grey wood that was only as high as they were. Above this were clean windows, to let in the light. I don't believe there was a ceiling.  I hurried through them; I had to escape. They had come for my parents, and detained them even now, but before they came my parents had told me quickly: "Go, you can evade them if you are crafty. You must carry forth the business. We are lost." I hid beneath the flowers, but still they rustled with my movement. I was forced to hold myself at odd angles, to avoid the stems and still touch only my feet and hands to the dry ground.  They searched and searched the house, but this little alcove was safe from their efforts. Either they did not know that it was here - could not find or see it - or they did not expect it to be a viable sanctuary. Whatever the reason, they did not seek me out. And when the moment was safe, I squirmed from among the tall plants and broke free of the wood enclosure.  I fled into the street before the house. I thought that I was safe now, I had made it to the open, and I stood tall in the cloudy light. But he was waiting for me there. Stepping from a car which I had thought was empty, he caught my wrist in his vastly larger hand.  "Let me go," I gasped. "I can't do that. You know I can't," he replied, cool. "You will not force me," I said. I would fight him. For my parents. He pulled me closer, yanking me by my captive wrist. His aviator sunglasses loomed over me, and his khaki bomber jacket made him enormous and imposing.  I pulled the boxcutter from the backpocket of my jeans.  "Do not force me," I hissed. He held me tighter. Slipping out the blade with a quiet snick, I forced it under the elasticised knitted cuffs of his coat. I slashed viciously through the veins of his wrist. He shouted, but still he did not release me. Again I cut his wrist, viciously, as desperate as a cornered animal. I  would  escape- he would not rob my freedom from me. Over and over I dragged the blade through his skin, cutting through his cuff now. I felt the crunch against his bones, the scraping and ripping. Even now the phantom sensation haunts me.  "Jenny-" he said, holding his wrist and falling to his knees. He had released me.  Coldness. It was him. I knew him now. Always he had dreamed of astronautics, but here he was now, a mere policeman. I was cold. I had loved him once- loved- and I had killed him. I. Was. So. Cold. I whispered his name before I could think. He was reaching for me. I shrugged him off and ran. I had killed him and I was cold. I ran - for my parents.

      the salmon are running. upstream, through the falls. counterclockwise. the nez perce kneel beside the water's edge, and scoop them from among the rocks. a makeshift tent of cerulean tarp crouches beside the road: the fish are for sale. a fifty dollar steelhead salmon for pennies. its a game. she wanders among them, towheaded among a field of long black braids, swarthy mens' faces. adorned in brilliant colours of orange and green and yellow, lost within the grey and black and faded blue-grey jeans. old, old levis.  the young men are beautiful. smooth, round cheekbones stretch proudly from wide mouths. long limbs, shapely, lightboned and broad at calves and forearms. and their skin is golden, like brown sugar or toffee. most have caramel eyes. delicious. damn it, theyre so delicious.

      Save the ones you can; put them in a taxi. Someone is crying - who is it? Hey, is she ok? Is she ok? Theyâ€™re being forced into the taxi, pushed and herded. They donâ€™t want to go, but to stay and help their friends. Force them. The driver is waiting. A hundred bucks, he says, if they puke in my car. Each. Shit.  Send the clean ones, get them clear. Theyâ€™ll go to safety, come back for the rest. What will we do with the rest? Send the ones you can. Load them in, as many as you can. Slap the roof: go. Theyâ€™ll come back for more. Itâ€™s the middle of the night - we canâ€™t find one of the girls. The other two went with the EMT. Theyâ€™re poisoned. We canâ€™t find the other - we donâ€™t care about anything else, just her. She might die, do you understand? She might get raped, or poisoned. We have to find her now. Call everyone who knows anything. We have to find her.  Were you there? Did you see where the girl went? She might die. Come with us in our wailing car, youâ€™ve seen more, youâ€™re not intoxicated. Come with us, we have to find her. Youâ€™re the only one who knows enough.  Sheâ€™s here. Thereâ€™s a mass of them; theyâ€™re out on the floor, and the couch. One answers the door; he canâ€™t see, canâ€™t think, can barely stand. Sheâ€™s ok. Poisoned, but safe. We found her, thanks to you who knows. Now we care about the rest. See my gun? Donâ€™t make it aim at you.  Itâ€™s over.

      "I have a question for  you ," he says, walking towards my lonely table. There are a few kids in the pool, but for the most part the vast conservatory is empty; it's almost midnight. Everyone else has gone to bed. We lonesome teenagers linger, yearning for company nearer our own age. Apparently, we think ourselves more likely to discover it in the early morning.  I know what his question is. I asked him the same not a day before. I'd been avoiding his eyes as he came down the stairs, embarrassed for my own audacity. But he came towards me, and he spoke. "I'm seventeen," I say, setting aside my book and lifting my cooling coffee to my lips. I don't even like it; I take my coffee Irish. This is not an option here. For my age group, at least. He pulls out the empty chair across from me, looking quizzically. I nod. He sets down his near-empty glass. Knowing I would need it from the coffee, I slip a lifesaver from my pocket and into my mouth.  An hour or two later: We're walking on deck. I'm too restless to simply sit still and chat, and he's humoring me. We stalk the cold promenade, looking down at the fourteen- and fifteen-year olds in the hot tub below us.  "Look," he says, pointing at an unidentifiable yellow light in the distance, toward shore,&nbsp;"a streetlamp." I laugh. "It's a buoy." "No. Streetlamp." "For the Eskimos?"&nbsp;I ask. He nods solemnly.  We discuss the little-visible landscape for a long while. At last, a surprising change: far off in the diamond speckled&nbsp;sky, a star falls.  "Was that-" I say. "Whoa," he says. Even this far north, comet sightings are rare. He looks at me from where he stands leaning against the railway to my left. I feign interest in the view for a moment, then give in and turn toward him. I smile a bit and nibble my lip. I know where this is going. And why shouldn't it? Some god has given us a divine signal that screams,  do it! . My heart is fluttering. I'm still so much a little girl.  He reaches out and brushes my cheek with his fingertips. My mind is squealing like a twelve year old at an N'Sync concert. I never liked them. I smile at him, pushing back the edge of my flapper cap, from the shameful designers at American Eagle. He's a brand name boy, though, and he respects it. Ok.  Moves in. I'm lost. Here we go. Forget the 'tweens' below, watching us, surely. Perhaps their eager young virgin bodies will be inspired to greater efforts than poolside flirting.  Mmm. Hands on his neck, don't you dare back off now. His hand is hot on my waist, sliding under my vintage denim jacket, well-worn sprite-green sweatshirt. Hands on his shoulders, a hand on my lumbar, a hand on my neck.  We stagger over to the wall, lean there for a moment, clumsily move away from the pools. No one goes this way, we know. Safe here. Cold cold  cold .  "Here let's go inside", someone says. Was it me? 'Have you seen that commercial,' a guy named M once asked me, 'where the chick and the guy make out in an elevator?' We didn't.  But then, a guy named S got M's wish. O dear. All the way down six floors. Nobody's here to witness. All the sane have gone to sleep. "My room is empty," he whispers. Yes. After telling me we were going on a cruise, my dad spent the next hour outlining the various punishments we would suffer if we brought someone into  our  room. Apparently someone else's room slipped his mind. A boy named S. Whose sticky mouth tastes like sugar. And a girl.  I'm lost.
