       You work your butt off all day You stress yourself to get your boss’ O K You go home wrecked and tired Meeting deadlines to avoid getting fired.  You forget your family &amp; friends You prioritize your colleague’s comments You work hard to get your stuff done You work until late, ‘til everyone’s gone.  You think you’ve achieved something You think people care a thing They’d laugh with you and thank a bit But that’s all there is and nothing more to it.     … a petal from a rose               there was a time that i felt like my work and everybody else was squeezing the vigor out of me. sucking up all my energy, giving me fake smiles and meaningless 'how are yous'.. such a stage of crapness!       just penned my thoughts one morning soon after i woke up - t'was just 6.00 am. then, i read this out at work during the morning briefing, everybody was there. some thought it was funny... perhaps sarcastic too!     oh! life...

          i wrote this poem while i was in a relationship that couldn't give     me an emotional security. i loved the guy, but i had always felt      and known that 'parting' will come. so i wrote this poem to      capture that moment where i was capable of saying to him -      'i love you and i always will'.  knowing that, ' that'  very moment     will also soon pass once the parting is done.      Time will pass… Far away you may sail There’s a chance that your memory will fail Distance and people might close our door, Then we might not be one anymore.  So, I wrote this poem for you to remember. That you and I once had times together That there was once a lass who loved you truly There was once a girl to you did things that are silly.  You will recall that once upon a time you’ve been lucky You were given, you were blessed with a girl like me And might wonder once more about things that came our way Scrutinize from each scene, “ IF ” you may say.  In time a smile in your face will also be seen And that’s when you’re thinking of the places we’ve been And the things we did - laugh and tease each other. ‘Hope these memories shall serve as a reminder.  But before you reminisce things of our past, Think of me, my presence from somewhere don’t cast. Never forget and be reminded still That once I told you, “ I love you and I always will ”.    ... a petal from a rose

        I used to frown during the setting of the sun I’d always feel cold, empty and glum. I hated to see the sun coming down the sky I never liked the sun saying goodbye.  It seemed to me that I’d be more lonely, It made me feel alone with nobody I associated it with tears and goodbyes The reason why I hated to see the shine dies.  That feeling had stopped when I finally set In my mind I entrenched something good I’ll get From the setting of the sun today becomes past Tomorrow is another day at last!  Tomorrow sun will rise, hope shall it bring Everything’s new just like the coming of spring. Life we can start anew, new dreams to build Everything’s new; new fruits are yield.  I frown no longer during the setting of the sun I just smile with new hopes that tomorrow will hum For deep inside I know, after the sunset Hopeful sunrise the next day I will get.      ... a petal from a rose

        I’d like to let you know, I enjoyed the times with you The talking, sharing Had set my heart aglow.  I’ve loved you that moment I know you did as well. I felt it so I’ll treasure In my heart it shall dwell.  Though it will come to pass It’s something special still It was a moment’s gift To cherish and so I will.  If it was but a fleeting flame We found in each other I know the message that touched In our hearts will linger.  If tomorrow would choose For feelings to wane Let today ourselves admit That our hearts feel much the same.  If this may be the last That I’d be able to tell you Allow my heart to say That I really cared for you.  For now I’d leave this sad thing To tomorrow which can tell How everything will end And when the wound will mend.        ... a petal from a rose

         I wrote this poem almost 8 years ago when i was feeling so down and felt like have been through a lot of ups and downs...felt pain, felt happiness, hoped for hopes and had to cling unto something to remain standing against all odds.      I’ve been through a long and winding road I have traveled so far ‘til my mind became broad.  I’ve shed tears after the bliss, I cried after laughter. I have answered questions but continued to think and wonder.  I have traveled life, left a trail of joy and sadness I’ll never forget the pain I experienced after gladness.  If I would count the wounds, if I would feel the pain I would be so proud of myself to be able to survive the rain.  If anyone could only feel the harshness and the blow He or she too will surely grow.  This is my sad story This is my fruitful journey.     ... a petal from a rose

       When the star we follow had gone into hiding As the rain cloud appears all smiling When crooked path seems the one guiding It’s the time that you mustn’t stop trying.  When the dream may seem unreachable As go we go our way in chasing the ball, When things we planned won’t shape up This is the time to push hard, not give up.  When the dream you dream becomes impossible. Start again but don’t you fall Dream good and dream anew For there isn’t a dream you can’t renew.  Hold on to your dream firmly and steadily For often it drifts apart unknowingly You’ll learn too late when time would come The dreams you made have all been gone.  Whatever may come let your dreams stand Don’t ever join the failure’s band Dreams may remain dreams for a while When they come true, truly worthwhile.       ...a petal from a rose

       This poem goes to a gorgeous lass Who’s really funny when she gives out gas Too often than not she belches out She’s one of a kind - without a doubt!   In the morning she comes wearing a smile Owing to the night that was worth her while. If you see her with a morning frown I guess because she was never out to town.   When she starts her work for the day …. Better be quiet or out her way She could be an angel she could be otherwise. She’s a real person, witty and wise.  There’s so much to like about her – Her singing, humming `and swearing like no other. In the office we could have hours of bliss Because of her and her phrase ‘What the fuck is this’.  So there you go my partner and friend…. Hope you’re okay with this, my life you won’t end. You are liked and loved the way you are. Stay that way – lively &amp; bright like a shining star.     ... a petal from a rose

             loving every moment ...     never thought that someone could love me this much.... never thought that i could love and give so much of myself to someone.  after going through tough times of that 'getting to know each other' stage,  sometimes we realize that no matter how loving, thoughtful, intelligent & fun that person can be, still he's not the one. then, when you u finally found that special someone, it's bliss! it's like finding that last missing piece of the puzzle!

        this poem was especially created for my one &amp; only partner in life who has given me all the love in this world - Jeffrey Ximo Ramos...the man who showed me what real love is!       Everything I have, you’ve got for me. The bliss, the truth that you made me see. The love you give - the same you keep Makes me alive, my heart upbeat.  My world you coloured, enchants me well. For I see the rainbow and there I dwell. My life when you entered is made complete, Full of joy, contentment replete.  The man you are is a man of word Every promise fulfilled, I thank the Lord! The way you care, the most I adore The reason for going on, to have this amour.  My days are blessed ever since you came I seriously journeyed and played no game You helped me get through life’s burden Offered a paradise, a Garden of Eden.  Myself so proud for I am with you The kind who’ll make me happy, never blue. This feeling for you never will I doubt, ‘Coz you are the person I cannot live without!      ...a petal from a rose
