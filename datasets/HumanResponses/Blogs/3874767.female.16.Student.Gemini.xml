       When your hurting I listen to you, I open my hand and take it in. I close my fist and you are better, I hold onto all the pain & frustrations so they do not bother you anymore. But when i'm in despair i'm all alone, left to deal with it myself. So i open my fist & see if there's anything that can help me but all I am left with is more hurt more anger more emptyness... until I fade away... submitted by: Pyro_52      what's this?

Tuesday July 6, 2004 9:52 AM ET Lies I am going crazy Everything is so gray What happened to the perfect yesterday My heart is so broken Yet it is intact Will it ever mend when can I have my life back The sins of the human race They tear my world apart What was I thinking When I gave you my heart I feel all alone Even when you are by my side All of this Because you won’t swallow your pride As the sun sets I close my eyes I try to drift in to sleep But tears fill my eyes One day you will be true To us and to your heart But can we make it that long Or will it tear us apart?

Tuesday July 6, 2004 9:49 AM ET A father finds his son praying at night. 'God bless Mommy, Daddy, and Grandma. Ta ta Grandpa.' The father finds this odd, but doesn't think too much of it. The next morning the grandfather dies. The father remembers the night before, but doesn't say anything. That night, the son prays, 'God bless Mommy and Daddy. Ta ta, Grandma.' The father hopes that nothing happens to the grandmother. Sure enough, the next morning the grandmother dies. At this point the father gets really scared. That night, the son prays "God bless Mommy. Ta ta, Daddy". The father stays up all night long, frightened. Early in the morning he goes to the doctor to make sure everything is fine. When he comes home, his wife is waiting frantically in the driveway and yells "Honey, come quick! The milkman just dropped dead on the porch!"  submitted by: noplanB      what's this?
