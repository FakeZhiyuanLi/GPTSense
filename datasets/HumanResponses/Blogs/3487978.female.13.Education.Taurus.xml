      My holiday was quite boring and quite fun (",) too! I went to Kuala Lumpur on the 2nd of June,2003 till 4th of June. then from the 4th till 6th June, I went to Genting Highlands.  I went to "Duta Vista" (hotel) at Kuala Lumpur. I went to that hotel many times before years ago. But years ago, the "quality" of the hotel was perfect. Everything available. I guess things change over the years... Basically, when we got in the room, there wasn't any soap in the soap dispenser in the shower and only one towel!!! How dumb is that? Even the aircon in the 2-single bed bedroom! It couldn't even on! On the 3rd, My family and I went to "Berjaya Times Square". Supposedly, it is the biggest shopping mall in the world! But practically, there is nothing much... There are not many shops, too. There's an indoor theme park with the pretty creepy roller coaster. It is practically 3 football fields long! Yeah, at the sight of it moving pretty quickly makes me damn dizzy. At night, we went to the KLCC. It is also quite big but at least there are many shops. Bought "No Nut Chocolate Chip Cookies" from Famous Amos. The next day, we checked out and went to "KAMDAR" to buy curtains and some other stuff. After going to KAMDAR, we had an one-hour drive to Genting Highlands...  We went to the Genting Shopping Centre... SO BORING!!! ok?? Anyway, we got free tickets to The Outdoor Theme Park and the Snow World.  Happened at the Outdoor Theme Park on the (5th June): Took rides on: Super Tobagon (Quite fast, it gave me a heartache. I met this person I know too...) Cable Car (Weehee... my sister is afraid of heights. But we had a whale of a time) Ferris Wheel (Yawn... so boring. it just go round and round) Flying Dragon (Weeee.So fast!!! Argh!! I shut my eyes and didn't scream, aren't I brave?) I guess thats it.  It was really fun and damn tiring lar... OK? Had lunch and went to SnowWorld.  It is damn cold. They gave us Winter Jackets to wear, even snow shoes and gloves!! In the SnowWorld, it was practically -3 degrees.. So cold! My sister keep throwing snowballs at me till my gloves practically came out and my hand froze, I had to get out to put it back on. When we were done, we gave back the shoes, jackets and gloves. Damn! My big toe was blue!! haha, my face also red!! AHAHAHA  on the 6th, I came back to Singapore.. Ok... Happy to get back. This is it. My Holiday Trip...   Eva Drama collapsed at 9:50:49pm

      Here's the review to Confessions of the Teenage Drama Queen:  Lola (Lindsay Lohan) is a mini Carrie Bradshaw. She's a native New Yoiker and has the attitude to prove it. But Lola has just had her teenage world turned upside down after her mom's decision to up sticks from the big city and relocate in an achingly uncool New Jersey suburb.   Lola sticks out like a sore thumb at her new school in Dellwood. She's got the crazy, quirky fashion sense of any self-respecting New York fashion follower and we suspect she'd be capable of having a tantrum if she couldn't find the right pair of shoes to match her latest boho-chic ensemble.   When a classmate asks her if she's not embarrassed at all the attention she's drawing to herself in her floaty white cheesecloth and lace combo, she shrugs and replies smugly, "Maybe I like the attention."   In fact, she's desperate to get maximum exposure and sets her sights on the lead role in the school play. That means going head to head with little Miss Popular, Carla Santini (Megan Fox), a confident brunette with a trio of wannabes constantly riding her coat-tails.   In the run-up to the school play, which is the film's disappointing climax, there are assorted fashion emergencies, a few stroppy incidents with nagging parents and an obligatory dance-off between the two female rivals.   The plot is humdrum, the jokes barely raise a smile and the scenarios are ridiculous, even if you're still young enough to pay half fare on the bus. The action, one suspects, is supposed to reflect the everyday dramas in a teenage girl's life, but the "comic episodes" are tedious and half-baked at best and ridiculously overdone at worst.   Despite a terrible script, Lohan holds her own admirably and proves she has real potential for offbeat comic roles. Her self-assuredness and natural charm makes the cringe-worthy musical numbers seem almost bearable and, for a young teenager, she pulls off a red glitter mini-dress and showgirl stilettoes with illegal degrees of sassiness.   Her confidence in the musical routines harks back to her days as a real-life budding popstar when she tried, unsuccessfully, to launch a solo singing career and dated Aaron Carter, younger brother of Backstreet Boys, Nick. She definitely has rhythm and personality, if bubblegum pop is your thing, but this certainly isn't the vehicle for her teen talents, nor will it signal her arrival on the serious acting scene.
