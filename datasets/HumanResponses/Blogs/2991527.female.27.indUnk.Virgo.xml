      hey everyone! well nothing much happened today except that i got third one my science fair project that i did with my friend caitling. now don't think "oh third is really good!" because its not. for one thing our school gives only first second and thirds and everyone gets a ribbon. our project was on acne and now i regret that i did it on that! i wish i did something else so ya i really hate our project except that i really like the design on our poster considering that i did it! so any way for our girls club we have secret penpals so we are combigning secret penpals and mother daughter night and the theme is beach party! we are a loowed to wear capris , sarons , t_shirts but not bathing suits! well any way my friend(yes thats u lane!) is coming over and we are going to make palm trees. any way i have to go now! bye!

      Hey everyone! today my sister came home !sometimes she can be so cool!  i am taking care of my aunt stephenie tonight . she is severley handicapped and is one of the reasons i want to teach special ed.  my msn has something wrong with it. i went online and then this guy who i deleted like last year was online and it showed up on my contacts list that he was online. i didn't no it was him and i ask who he was.  it was SO weird . i hate talking to him lane he is NOT hot.don't get any ideas.(lol)  hows mark?(lol)  any way nothing much to say except this:  one day a fat lady stepped on a scale and its on of those scales that once u step on it a piece of paper with something written on it pops out of the scale. so the lady steps on the sclae and a piece of paper pops out that reads: ONE AT A TIME PLEASE!
