      Well then, today was rather good. I FINALLY got my ticket to Dethfest for September 3 & 4. I can't fucking wait. I'm sorry, but $35 for an entire weekend pass to see upwards of 15 bands (I don't know the exact number, could be more, could be less) is a pretty damn good deal. However, Dethfest is being held in Lethbridge (or, as it's known to the metal heads in Alberta, DETHbridge) and I need to pay for transportation, shelter, and food. A friend and I will be staying in a hotel together, and I think it ends up costing somewhere between 40-50 dollars each for that. Plus his mother is acually driving us to the venue, so it will be a bit cheaper to pay for gas than to pay for a bus ticket. And food...meh, I can live on cheap takeout for a couple days. I believe we will be leaving on Saturday, September 3 in the AM. Staying Saturday night, and then driving back to Calgary on Sunday evening. So only one night away from Calgary.  I was going to check out on getting a tattoo today, but I didn't. There was a little tattoo place down by Charisma, but I'm a bit weird, and I want quality. So, off to the smiling Buddah. But it's a good ways away, and we figured by the time we'd get there it would be closed. I KNOW one that I want to get for sure. I'm going to get "Carpe Diem" written on the back of my neck in cursive. That shouldn't be too expensive. I also want another one on my arm, but I don't know exactly what. I'm thinking a dragon, because I love dragons. Or a skull, because I also dig skulls. Originally I wanted a dragon wrap-around, going from the middle of my upper arm, around my elbow, to the middle of my fore-arm, but that wouldn't work for me. I have really skrony, really ugly arms, so that would make me look more like a crack-addict than a hardcore rocker! I found one I kind of like. It's fairly small, but it's still pretty bitchin'. It's a dragon, but it looks like it's bursting out of my arm. Hard to explain... urlLink http://www.bullseyetattoos.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID=1396   That's the tattoo. I think it's pretty cool, but apparently I have horrible taste. Whatever, I dig it, so I'll get it if I want. Actually, I won't, because I'd need to pay to get the designs/guide off of that site. Bastards...maybe I can find a similar one. Who cares...I'm all talk anyway. I want a tattoo, but I probably won't get one. I'm too damn bad with my money.  I'm getting kind of homesick. I have a picture next to my computer of one of the beaches in my hometown in Newfoundland. It's a really pretty picture. It has the sunset reflecting off the water. Really gorgeous. I love it there. I don't know if I could live there anymore though. People seem to think there's nothing to do in Calgary...try this place. But still, it's home.  I hope tomorrow after work I get to see Arielle. She's going away again, and I would like to see her once more before she goes. But if I don't...HAVE FUN ARIELLE! Even though I don't think you read this very often.  Anyway I'm done for now. Thank for caring about my life, all.....hmm...1 of you. Maybe a couple more. BLAH!  Anyway, whoever is out there, don't fear the reaper, and Carpe Diem!

      What is the leading cause of suicide amongst teenagers do you think? Is it teasing/bullying? Me thinks not. Is it being "dumped?" Me thinks not. Is it the loss of a loved one (ie. mother, father, etc.?) Me thinks not. What me thinks it is is the future. Us teenagers worry far too much about the future. Take me, for example. I was happy as a lark not worrying about anything for the past few years. Now it's dawning on me; this up coming school year will be my final one. After that, it's the real world. When the hell did that happen? REAL WORLD? No...not yet! I'm not ready to leave the womb. My mommy still cooks my meals for me. Hell, she still buys my socks. I don't want to venture out into the real world. It's cold out there, and there are wolves...  So, now I must think what I am going to do for the rest of my life. Rest of my life? I can't even decide what kind of candy I want to buy when I go to the seven-eleven. ARGH! So here's what I was thinking: Electrical Engineer. No, don't think so. Work load would be far too much, and I was never very good at handling stress. Okay, so maybe a career track in the military? Maybe, but probably not. There are too many people I love in this world to join the military. I always wanted to, but lets face it, I couldn't handle being oversease for 6 months at a time having shells launched at me. I could handle the shells, but lets say for what ever reason someone falls in love with me, and we get married. Shouldn't I think about them? What would happen to them if I died? What if at some point I want to have children? What would they do growing up without a father? And my parents...No parent wants to out live their kids. Personally, I don't want to out live my parents...I'm really scarred of loosing them. I wouldn't want to put the people I love through that kind of hell. So, those two options are out. How about an electrician? Well, you would think that would be very possible. My brother is an electrician, so he could take me on as an apprentice, right? Wrong. He said before when I mentioned it that it's highly unlikely that a person as young as him could take on an apprentice. Maybe it was just that company he was working for at the time, but it would make sense for every company. So what the hell do I do?  Tonight my eyes were opened to something completely new and different: medicine. I could become a doctor. All I need is a bachelours degree in ANYTHING, and then I could get in to medical school. So...four years for a bachelor's degree. Then, four years in medical school. Then, I'm Dr. Aaron Brown. However, if I choose to become a specialist, like a surgeon (go Weird Al Yancovich!) then it's another 5 years on top of that. Add to that the fact that getting in to medical school is extremely difficult, I would have my work cut out for me. The University of Calgary has a list of courses which they "recomend" taking for people planning to get into Med school. I think what I'm going to do is talk to my counselour in school and find out what high school courses I would need to take those particular subjects. Lets see...I would more than likely need biology...so I would need to take 2 classes of that. Then there's also chemistry...that another 2 classes. Then Physics, already got one of them done, so only one more to go. Then of course Calculus. So all in all...I would need to take a grand total of 5 courses that I do NOT have room for in my scheduele in school. You know what REALLY pisses me off? If our stupid ass school and our stupid ass principal didn't change the way our stupid ass scheduele worked, I would be able to do all those courses in school time. However, no I would need to take night school, or summer school, or whatever. Thanks alot, assholes.       You think Metallica will be looking for a third guitarist anytime soon? Ugh......

      Today was really great. Let's see...woke up, and then went out. I went to see Garfield with Arielle. What a great movie...I love that orange cat. He is officialy my hero in life. I am going to try and be more like Garfield.  THEN, we went shopping. Not only did we go shopping, but I actually enjoyed it. I'm not a big fan of shopping, but it was fun. Maybe I'm becoming metro-sexual. ALL because I had one day where I enjoyed shopping. yes...yes indeed.   We're here We're not queer But we're close Get used to it!   Arielle, you are my hero. You bought me a wizard! Thank you so flippin' friggin' much. I love it. Now my dragon has a brother. I shall name him Gandalf. Or Elrond. What should I name him? GAH! I haven't even named my dragon! NOOO!  I just watched Canada lose in rowing. They came in fourth place, which means they didn't qualify for the finals. Now the best they can do is seventh. That makes me sad. I love Canada, and I love watching my fellow coutry-people win. They work so hard, train so much, give up so much, just for the OPPERTUNITY, not the guarntee, at olympic glory. I look up to them so much. They're not like those greedy ass hockey players. "Oh, we only make 4 million dollars a year, we want a raise!" Get a life you hosers! Look at the olympians...they get practicaly NO money. THEY are the real athletes, not you prick hockey players. And don't even get me started on baseball...  I think I could be a baseball player. I used to be pretty good. I don't want to sound full of myself, but I could play. But my throwing arm is messed, so I can't throw. And now, my OTHER shoulder is messed up, so there's no hope for me. Damn...I could have made 12 million dollars a year for hitting a ball with a stick.  I ate a pack of bacon for dinner. Probably not very healthy, but screw it. I'm lazy, and don't want to cook anything else.  Now the Americans just finished fourth in another rowing race, so they don't advance either. I'm not a lover of America, but you got to feel sorry for these people. they train for like 4 years just for one race, and to not even qualify...that's gotta be a cold slap to the groin. ALL Olympic athletes, from every country around the world (that's in the olympics), I salute you.  I guess it's true. The olympics to bring the world together. Normally, I would be spitting on the Americans. But they deserve to win just as much as anybody. Individuals aren't to blame for the way America works. During the opening ceremonies, the American athletes and the Iraqi athletes smiled together, laughed together, and even took photographs together, with arms drapped around one-another's shoulders. It's really odd that two nations at war with one another could be brought together by brutal competition. You have got to love that. Maybe we should have the olympics more often than every 2 years. How about every 2 weeks?

      Well well well, I'm pretty damned tired. I shouldn't be, considering I got...well, I guess not a helluva lot of sleep last night. Quite the voyage me and my friends had. Indeed. Let's see...walking from downtown to Inglewood. That took...let's say about 45 minutes to an hour. then, from Inglewood to Forest Lawn, that took another hour. And Matthew, you bad bad man, wanting to go and wake up poor Arielle to make her give us a ride home...tsk tsk tsk.  Anyway, yeah. The movie was pretty good. Aliens VS Predator, for those of you who didn't know what I went to see. I thought it was a good movie. I guess it was better than I was expecting, but at the same time not as good. I never   saw   one human get their head ripped off. I never saw any humans get brutally murdered...well, minus the one downtown, but that's not in the movie...(That was a joke, by the way). All in all, it was a descent movie. Definately worth the over priced movie ticket. I was hoping at the end he would at least kiss her, or even get a little action, if ya know what I mean, but oh well. Poor dude. He died for her, and never even got a kiss on the cheek. Wait...did he even HAVE a cheek? Next movie to see: Garfield. I hope it's good. I loved the old Garfield and Friends cartoon. Hell, I still do. Those farm animals crack me up...  Anyway, I guess that's it for now. Sorry if my life isn't interesting enough for you, but that's the life I'm forced to lead, so YOU have to deal with it! Fare thee well, and Carpe Diem.

      Been here before Been here before couldn't say I liked it Do I start writing this down? Just let me plug you into my world Can't you help me be uncrazy?  Name this for me, heat the cold air Take the chill off of my life And if I could I'd turn my eyes To look and see what's comin'  It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive And I die a little more It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive Each moment here I die a little more  Then the unnamed feeling It comes alive Then the unnamed feeling Takes me away  I'm frantic in your soothing arms I can not sleep in this down filled world I've found safety in this loneliness But I can not stand it anymore  Cross my heart hope not to die Swallow evil, ride the sky Lose myself in a crowded room You fool, you fool, it will be here soon  It comes alive, It coems alive, It comes alive And I die a little more It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes Alive Each moment And I die a little more  Then the unnamed feeling It comes alive Then the unnamed feeling Treats me this way And I wait for this train Toes over the line And then the unnamed feeling Takes me away  Get the fuck out of here I just wanna get the fuck away from Me I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate I hate it all, why? Why? Why me?  I cannot sleep with a head like this I wanna cry, I wanna scream I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate I wanna hate it all away  -------------------------------------  Okay, I'm not a HUGE fan of St. Anger, but the songs on there aren't as bad as many people seem to believe. The only song I can't stand is Purify...such a stupid song. What really bugged me was the annoying snare drum, and the fact that Kirk Hammett (The man I;ve idolized since I was 8) never played a single guitar solo. That really bugged me. I think that if they re did it with a sensible snare drum, and maybe some kick ass, face meling solo's, it could be a really good album. I mean, there are some pretty awesome riffs on that album. The lyrics leave something to be desired, but whatever. If I could write lyrics like are on St. Anger, I would be about one billion times better of a writter than I am now. But I'm not here to debate St. Anger. The meaning of my life is plain and simple.........................  ...And as soon as I figure out what it is, than I will get back to you on it!
