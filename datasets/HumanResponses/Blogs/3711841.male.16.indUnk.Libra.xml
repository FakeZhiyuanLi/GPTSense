                          Autobiography    By Eric Heppner   The air was far too cold for it was a late march blizzard outside. The confining blanket of blue was not the same for it was not alive, it felt abrasive and rough compared warm softness from which I had just come. All twenty-two inches of my body shivered slightly from shock. My journey had been difficult to Fergus Falls, Minnesota, maybe because I had tried to take too much with me. Ten pounds and three ounces is a lot of baggage. My face was bruised something awful, my mother had always called me a prizefighter for that. I recognized a few of the voices surrounding me though I saw little besides soft white light and shades. I noticed one shade in particular. His voice was deep and frightening yet familiar and warm. I heard my name called out in song, I knew it because I had heard it all my life, Eric Ole Heppner. The shade spoke as if he didn’t expect me to be there to receive it. I heard singing for the first time. It was praise, praise to God that I had been born. I did not know this. When the tremendous shade held me in his arms, as a reaction, my body, without my consent, released my stored waste upon him. This only dampened his mood for a second as his strong arms held me all the closer. His name was Steven.  I learned from a far a more familiar voice that called me away from his arms. Her name was Joan. I had heard it many times throughout my journey yet her voice was my voice, her breath mine, and her love was mine. She held me gently to her breast and I could hear her heart, the heart that I had heard for nine months. That moment on March 27, 1987 was the greatest moment of my life.  	My older brother Jon had spoken for me for the first year or so of my life. This made life very simple. I ate when he did, slept when he did, and got changed when he did. But I never had a first word. I had a first phrase. “I read a book.” What I wanted was for my parents to read to me. This was my first individual want, and I am glad that it was dedicated to a search for knowledge. My first actual word then would be “I” and for the life of speaking afterward, I would be trying to explain that word to others. Even though I was now speaking for my self, Jon was still wanting for the both of us. We did everything together. Early in the morning Jon would climb into my crib and when I had more wants I would say to him “Jonston leave me alone!” as I couldn’t pronounce Jonathan. This would never abate him and I would soon be awake and on an adventure whether it was eating various berries outside or flying imaginary planes made out of large cardboard blocks in the living room.  There was no limit to my imagination and Jon’s thirst to never sit still.  	One particularly large adventure came when we found the special advantage that men have over women. We found that we unlike women could pee any place and at any time we desired. This magnificent freedom sent us on a quest to water every plant outside our Staten Island, New York parsonage. We built a small following in this venture and our best friends from church, Marcos and Luis, would ease the burden of our quest and passion. Yet with this help there came a terrible cost and her name was Maria. She was old yet I can never remember her getting any older, and she was little. She had had six boys and a girl; seven children in all and I remember thinking that each one of them must have taken a piece of her to make because there wasn’t much altitude left. Yet this had been attributed to her as her greatest weapon against our small band and our free ways for the closer she was to the ground the closer she was to her sandal. She wore leather sandals with everything, and it only lay at the most two feet from her hand that must have been made of wind. On one of our front lawn escapades, Maria caught us giving fluid to desperate shrubbery in the flowerbed. There she stood, all four feet of her magnificent power ready. As one can recall in the midst of great danger the motions of something so fast that it is uncaught by the natural eye.  I shall recall her motion. She flipped the leather weapon off her foot into the naked air in front of her and leaped forward. The sandal spun twice in the air and Maria caught the heel in her hand. She relinquished a scream that froze us dead to our very souls even if we had had time to go anywhere. I saw the face of Marcos get slapped and pushed out of the way as it headed like an arrow for its next target plowing Jon’s face back wards as he fell into the flowerbed. Louis next received the punishment and I saw saliva rocketed from his mouth as contact was made. I watched with terror unfelt in my young mind as with a helpless stare I saw the sandal close in inevitably on my tender jaw. The contact didn’t hurt at first yet surprised me as my slow motion vision had ended and those long mille-seconds ended as I spiraled through the air into the flowerbed in an instant. The pain rushed to my cheek as if I had no skin, muscle, or tissue of any kind left and the pain was simply flowing out onto the ground to create the next flood that would destroy the world. Luckily my cheek was still there. The shock of this left me dry for several days and nearly ended my infamous peeing crusade. Yet I have been notorious for not knowing when I have been vanquished.  	It had only been a month after the Maria incident and I peed alone. Groups where to conspicuous. On occasion Jon would help but I didn’t feel safe with anyone else anymore. My legs were crossed when Marcos and Louis came. On this day I felt the irrepressible urge to water the honeysuckles that traipsed the fence of our yard. I stood on a solid fort built by my father to house Jon’s and my adventures. On this second story hideout I did the dastardly deed again. My golden arch reaching the honeysuckles, the fence, and the sidewalk. This was my error. Luckily I did not make the apocalyptic error of hitting a passerby in NYC with anything more liquid and warm then a sideways glance, and even that was dangerous. My ramifications for my sin came from across the street. Gwenn, one of my dad’s parishioners, happened to see my pernicious deed and I had barely gotten my fly back up when my mother, ear fresh from the phone, brought swift ramifications upon my backside and ears. Thus ended my illustrious urinating career and routed the last urination threat left in the community. I was to reform and forever after have been forced to use the head.

                                  The Lilies of Connecticut    By Eric Heppner   Jordan flipped his car off the road during a late clear night in Connecticut. He got out and walked toward a house in the center of the woods. It was a small house, yet when he opened the door it showed a huge open plain that contrasted the night outside with the day within. He entered and the door stood open like a cut in the wind, bleeding wind and leaves through. Jordan walked through the tall grass to a large flat pool in the center. He bent over to the pool and lifted some water to a cut that had appeared on his head from the crash, the cut stopped bleeding and then disappeared. The crash left him covered in bruises and cuts and his arm was badly broken, in hope to placate his pain he slid into the placid pool. The walls of the lake were sheer and the clarity of the water betrayed the depth. He fell through the water as if it were thin cotton sheets. The water finally thickened and he gasped for air as he had been holding his lungs. The water slid into his through and the sides of his neck soothing him. He stopped moving and the water stopped flowing and he felt out of breath again. He kicked his legs but they barely moved and in desperation he arced his back moving a massive tail behind him propelling him forward at a great speed. He reached forward with his hands which were webbed to the first knuckle and very smooth. His ailments had passed away. He swam forward at an incredible pace, the faster he went the clearer his mind. Soon his tail burned as the muscles strained. He saw a light below him and fled toward it. As he approached he could make out a city,  a massive golden city surrounded by awe giving fields of purple and blue and green. The base to the golden city was coral that was nearly transparent as tiny creatures moved in and out strengthening it. He swam to the city and the men and women in the field approached him with awe on their faces. They kept they're distances and whispered among themselves. Several young children raced to the city yelling in a strange melodic voice, that Jordan strangely understood, they yelled victory, victory, he returns, he returns. The city poured with people of every size age and build all of them had wonder etched plainly on their faces. One old man came to him and held an old rusty metal rod. A worthless lump of rust that looked hewn from the car Jordan used to drive, the axle maybe that was so horrible it had cracked and flipped him. The elder presented Jordan the gift. He tried to refuse but the aged man was insistent. He reached out with his strong purple hand and lightly touched the metal and the most marvelous thing happened. As his fingers lightly caressed the jagged metal the flakes of rust melted into silver metal beneath. He grasped the growing bare silver spot with a familiarity that was returning to his hand from a long forgotten dream. The pole transformed into a flowing silver color that looked like a waterfall of platinum without the crash simply a steady beautiful stream. The scepter was fluted on all sides and at the summit was a grand pearl, the greatest in the ocean it held a slight pink hue within its swirling white wonder. From the staff his arm was coated in silver plates that decorated him. His chest was adorned with a single silver banner that flowed with the water around him, and on his head was formed a stunning gold crown that reached to the surface with seven fingers each crowned in a little pearl. He looked over his people of which he was king. They chanted his name yet in their language it took enough syllables to be a chorus of intense melodic beauty. Jordan looked toward the old man that had brought him and he saw the face of his greatest friend. He touched the face of the elder and the age passed from him. He found in the old man the general of his armies, the advisor to his thrown, and the keeper of the city in his absence, his name was Mathew. Mathew became not unlike himself in the beauty and grace of a people of a great age.  	Finally came to him one ragged old women. She had a tear in her eye that surpassed the beauty of the city, and the fields, and the pearls. He saw greatness in her. He reached out and touched her face with wonder and mystery and the hope that he would reveal her true beauty. The women shattered and fell away too the ground. The king was devastated at the loss of this beauty and chased after the shards. As they fell to the ground they broke again and again into a fine dust and as they touched the ground. They were eaten by the seaweed that then grew together and formed a glorious white bulb. The bulb broke and pedal upon peddle fell away before the kings eyes. Finally at the very core of the now heavenly flower there sat a maiden rained in white foam with a crown of purple fish swimming above her head. He swam to her and held her head in his strong hands. He lowered his head to hers and as their lips touched all the flowers in all the fields in all the oceans of the world bloomed a glorious white flower The king married his new queen that day on a platform of pink coral under a tent of translucent silver cloth. He then sat on his golden thrown and ruled wisely in ageless beauty with his glorious queen. Every summer after that glorious year the lilies of Connecticut yield white flowers in their honor.

                         Lifewright    By Eric Heppner   It was the forest Lifewright With boughs of green and gold That held the stars of heavens And shaded the men of old  Through it ran river faithful Which flowed through every root That quenched every fire And washed away the soot  The insects of Lifewright The mantis and the bees Kept the order of the forest And flowered all the trees  Still it was the druid Who sparked live in the wood Who loved the forest As only its father could  His eyes saw all the corners His mind foresaw the wind His hand started the beat of the heart And could stop deaths painful singe  He guided the trees of Lifewright Crafted each branch with his hand He brought up the golden kernels of grain And gave the fruit to the land  The forest grew tall and glorious Its roots grew down to core They filled all the soil with grasping hands And still they wanted more  They stretched the bounds of the river Their roots reformed the soil Its bottom sank into the waste And sunk its might to spoil  As the water fled the sun grew hot And turned forest plush to hard It dried the leafs to fire The forest’s face forever marred  Now the forest was ablaze The faithful all were gone The trees fell quietly around him The druid was now alone  He gripped the last seed From when the trees were young and grew He groped his fingers through the blackened ground And hoped the forest would grow anew  He dug at the base of the river For the scent of a drop He dug till his strength left him But the water was for naught  He pleaded with his servants The mantis and the bees They flew far away  Yet never found the trees  His strength was gone And his tongue was dry His eyes were heavy He was about to die  He buried the seed Still clenched in his fist His last tears fell For the forest he missed  For an age he lay Unspoiled by the world His hand tightly closed As the seed unfurled  Watered by the tear That it had stored so long ago Its roots ran through the ground And the faithful began to flow  The tree grew slow and strong The faithful steadily poured And watered the trees first fruit The cycle now restored

                             Moving On    By Heide Hoffarth   Our time has come, a time to move on; A time to reflect on the past and look to the future. As we leave this place, may we be filled with a sense of His grace, As we embark on this new journey in our lives. When we think about the past, we laugh and cry, But now we have to leave, and I don't know why. We will leave our mark on the world, As doctors, painters, and businessmen. And as we think about the latter, we think about when We will see eachother again Face to face, after we have left our mark  And come to realize that the real world  Isn't all we thought it would be, But that we have the strength in and of our  God to help us see that we did the best  That we could- thank you Class of 2003.   The author is a student at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa.

All these feelings I'm feeling inside. Why do I feel so much pain? All the blood rushes through my veins. Why do I feel like I'm hurting another? All I am is a mask with a cover. Why cover something I can't even see? All because I don't want you to see the real me. Why do I feel like I'm wearing a mask? All of my feelings I no longer grasp. Why does all of this run through my mind? All the answers; too hard to find. Why try to look when I can't even see? All I see is a reflection of me.

                        The Long March    By Eric Heppner   March, march, march Left, then left, then right. Death is beating across my back, But I will survive the night.  My boots are worn Through the soul, Yet my feet are tough, And my mind is whole.  The stench of death Runs down the road, But my eyes stay straight; My spirit stays bold.  I cannot die, For my will is too strong, My mind is too sharp, My life will be long.  I will see my homes again: The Southern sands, The northern mountains, For I protect those lands.  I stride with the confidence That I am far away From that aged field Where my deathbed lay.  I will not die in this war; My life is too great. I will change the world Before I meet my fate.  With this confidence,  My battles are won; My heroism shines; My medals are hung Back in my tent For another time, Another life, Another design.  For now there is duty That must be done; Victories to be had; Battles to be won.  March, march, march, Has led us to the field Where our valor is shown In the weapons we wield.  The enemy is here, Weak and scared, Our guns are fired. Their ranks are marred.  I laugh at them, Defying my death. As their bullets fly, One enters my breast.  A mistake has been made;  I fire to rectify The fool it was  That let it fly.  My breath is short, Cut small into gasps That spit up blood Along with my rasps.  It will not be; My day has not come, Yet I can feel the darkness Begin to overcome The will I had When the war had begun. I lie on my back; And can’t see the sun..  “No!” I scream. I will not die here. I will not give in To this cadaver’s fear.  “My life is not spent!” I yell. As I rise from the ground, I hear the victory shouts-- What a beautiful sound.  Later that night, In victory’s camp, I lie back waiting For my breath to revamp.  I look to the doctor, Yet no time can be spared For an able soldier With breathing impaired, Whose limbs are still strong, And trigger finger quick-- For many are dying, And many are sick.  There are legs to be severed, And bones to be set; Cuts to be bandaged, And makers to be met.  And in all the turmoil, I am transparent, With which my unwelcome Is made apparent.  I cannot feel my breath; My lungs feel halted; My chest seems still; Yet my senses must be faulted, For still my mind works, And my legs do their purpose, For my life is too important For ailments to surface.  I see a man crying, I ask what he’s lost; He says, “why must war Have such great cost? Cause so much death, And pervert so many living? Why can’t men find peace, Joy, and thanksgiving?” “Because men are human” I say with a smile. “There will always be that which is vile.. Which we must destroy-- To preserve our world And keep our homes Safely curled, Away from the destruction That would destroy the race And take the beauty of humans From the planet’s face.” But the man keeps crying As if he had not heard, Or thought the reasons I’d given Were purely absurd.  So I move on past the man With my victorious mood-- Off to the mess To acquire some food, For inside I am empty, That I cam feel, And I need the comfort Of a good, hearty meal.  As I sit at the table, Behind potatoes, and meat, Corn, and green beans, And Cake as a treat, Behind baskets of rolls, And puddings, and pies, A whole plate of cookies, Yet all of them are lies. For as I bite into the meat, The flesh turns to soil; The potatoes to manure; The green beans are spoiled.  My emptiness roared As my bare stomach wrenched; My mind filled with fury, As my fists fly clenched, At the table of plenty And the food flies off the table Onto the ground, Around men who were able To enjoy the meal. Without convulsing in pain At the feel of food for the living On the tongue of life’s bane.  I did not feel my heart, Yet it could not be true-- My life was too vital, So I flew from the room.  I am running far Without breath or weary; Without the feel of the wind, And the burn of muscle searing.  I run through the night, And with the first light, I find the harbor That would aid my plight, For it held the ship That could bear me home, Where I could assuage my fears And not be alone.  The ship is called sorrow; Which is aptly named, For it bears the souls That death has claimed.  I wandered the ship, Whose job was to ferry The unlucky ones home To sadly be buried.  At the end of my voyage, As I roamed through the hold, I came upon a box That added fear to my cold.  The box held markings That I was sure I knew, Yet I seemed to have forgotten For my memories are few.  As I stared at the letters Carved into the wood, The meaning came suddenly And I understood.  The words were clear: Robert M. James. I ran because It was my earthly name.  Over the side of Sorrow,  I do not care If what I run on is nothing but air. I have to find The one who would know What had happened, why my reflection wouldn’t show.  When I reached my home, I ran to my girl-- She sat in a chair With letter unfurled. It read from my commander Who had to have lied. For it gave the message That in battle I had died. I try to lift The tears from her face, Or feel my love In her embrace. But the tears still flow; my embrace was cold my hands aren’t there And my time is getting old.  I look at the face Of my darling wife. And can feel the tether break That ties me to life.  My spirit is failing I have nothing left. My mind is finished Deceiving death.

                                  "Havelock baseball rolls past SW Onslow"    By Corey Friedman   HAVELOCK, N.C.--Rams head coach Chad Smothers said his team didn't play as well as expected Monday afternoon, but the scoreboard said otherwise.  After a sluggish start, Havelock ignited in the early innings to spring ahead by six runs, eventually easing past Southwest Onslow 8-2 to remain undefeated on the season.  "It was good enough, but it wasn't a great, great effort," Smothers said. "We played hard, but it wasn't as sharp at times as we need to be later on. That's a little disappointing, but I thought Chris Holden pitched pretty well--he did a good job today throwing strikes."    urlLink Full Story   Originally published and copyrighted in the March 9 Sun Journal.

                            "Homegrown Products"    By Corey Friedman   WINTERVILLE, N.C. -- Déjà vu took on a whole new meaning last Saturday.  Four homegrown athletes squared off on the baseball diamond last weekend as Pitt Community College hosted Louisburg College in a National Junior College Athletic Association doubleheader.  Wearing PCC pinstripes were former Havelock High School standout Phil Schandorff and Zach Williams, formerly of New Bern High. In the opposing dugout sat Kenny Flythe--dubbed K-Fly during his time as a Bear--and West Craven's Mike Ange.   urlLink Full Story    NOTE:  Corey apologizes for the appearance of "hogging" the blog, but if Eric would stop WRITING poetry long enough to POST it, we'd have more of a balance between fictional literature and fake journalism.

                 Unalterable Ocean    By Eric Heppner   One day a man, With staff in hand, Marched arrogantly against the Ocean.  He cast aside the rod and said “You will kneel before my head, For I will conquer you Ocean.”  “How can you be such a fool? Think me not a little pool, You cannot win for I am the Ocean”  Then bold, the man strode into the surf, Defiantly stomping to foamy turf, Saying “I will break you, Ocean.”  “Come then oh tiny mortal, But beware for I give no safe Portal, Today you dance with the ocean.”  Then the breakers assailed And the waters prevailed Casting the man to the briny depths  From crest to crest Poseidon gave him no rest As he screamed for unreachable breaths  Then Neptune regurgitated in disgust This weakling who could not take one gust From the lungs of the mighty Ocean  A broken man on the beach wept, “Why oh why could not I have kept, My pride away from the Ocean.”

       Walking    By Eric Heppner   Out the window life goes by Images blur into another It’s a long lonely trip But my motor keeps whirring The motor that halts just long enough For me to walk around at night To walk the cramps out of my legs Yet when morning breaks My vehicle starts up again And I go off again Like it or not  I’ve seen the world It’s a big place I once that I could see it all But the first steps of my journey Claimed ultimately that impossibility Still I drive on against impossibility Hoping to see enough Before my motor quits Before my vehicle is too hold and broken Before I lose heart  Through my best efforts, age sets in And I’d still like to see that first museum again To catch the things I’d missed Though that is a very long list But the hydraulics don’t work any more But my journey continues, slower than before  Motion is slower, I’m hardly moving at all Though I still get out at night and walk without walls I try to go as far as I can, before the morning calls me back To the vehicle that is old, and worn, and slack  One morning my vehicle, didn’t start at all I came back from my walk and looked at it for a while Other vehicles came by, and buried my car I just kept walking, didn’t matter how far

                         Nede    By Eric Heppner   	There was light in existence for the first time. The translucent brilliance of the womb, tried my new eyes. There was motion as well. Motion and light enveloped me. Then finally, there was pain, pain beyond thought, pain that preceded the darkness. 	I awoke from the darkness into a light that did not hurt my eyes. Stepping forward by instinct, I felt my own form. It was bigger than I had though, or remembered. I could see, smell, and distinguish touch. What I saw I understood as naturally as a lifetime of familiarity. The solid trees, soft soil, and ever-moving water were familiar and beautiful to me. I wandered in the world, without pain. My mind gave me strange visions of a life I had never had. 	The people of the city were all like me. They all wandered in and out of the different houses that belonged to no one. There was all manner of food that appeared without work on long tables. Yet, there was no desire to eat it, for there was no hunger in the city. People slept in large soft beds, despite not being tired. No weary pulled on the people’s eyes. No blissful ache invaded the muscle, no matter the toil or strain, of which there was none. The perfect city’s name was Nede. 	The people of Nede, like me, all knew the lives they would have had, if they had not come here. Some would smile, when they first saw the life of hardships that they had bee spared. All though, eventually turned sullen as they saw what could have been, the choices left unmade, and things left unchanged. 	I know nine musicians, whose lives would have created beauty on the Earth, where there was none before. There are athletes who have never known the heights of victory and the resilience of defeat. I see innumerable lovers who will never know a living relationship, the warmth of a lover’s embrace, or the trust and fulfillment that comes from a lover’s silence. I have the friendship of a woman who would have been a great healer. She would have cured the plague of cancer from the world. Now she sits under the trees. Unable to save the lives of the people she has never been able to meet.  	I am often asked, around the dinner table, what would have become of my life, had I lived. I would have been simply a teacher. I would have been great to a few. I would have had a wife and two children. Though now, I have nothing. I never made it past birth.

                    Satire    Kobe Bryant Crowned Lakers' MVP    By Corey Friedman   LOS ANGELES—His wide-toothed grin gone the way of his signature Afro hairstyle, a furious Kobe Bryant retreated from the Lakers’ locker room to sulk yesterday after being unanimously voted the team’s Most Valuable Pervert and awarded a trophy depicting an electric toaster hovering above a bathtub.     "I can honestly say that no one deserved this more than Kobe," said Los Angeles starting center Shaquille O’Neal. "The little freak should do us all a favor and take the trophy's suggestion. But out of all the pervs in the Lakers' line-up, Kobe is by far the most talented athletically."     The gutless worm is currently standing trial in Eagle, Colo. for the rape and sexual assault of a hotel employee. An insistent coward who refuses to own up to his repugnant actions, Bryant entered a plea of not guilty.     The MVP award was presented before a capacity crowd at the Staples Center yesterday afternoon. Child molester and musician R. Kelly was scheduled to perform at the ceremony, which was cut short when the brooding baller bolted.     Bryant priggishly refused to answer to reporters' questions after the awards ceremony, acting like the repulsive bottom-feeder he is.     "Even though looking at Kobe Bryant makes me want to vomit out my innards, there’s no denying his ability on the basketball court," said Lakers head coach Phil Jackson. "This sicko has a gift for basketball. He truly is the most valuable pervert we regret having on the team."

      All Night Murder  She picks up the pen, so she can write. Watching as the day turns to swift night. Blood vessels clench, hands turn white. Hate fills her soul, holds her so tight there's no breath, there's no air. Just the sensation of nausea and that feeling of despair as she lifts her head and looks at him bound by rope, gagged by sin. The rage holds her in grip so strong as she slowly brings her insturment down. No longer a pen, now only a knife built to stab and cut and slice. Strangled noises beg for release, until one swift jab causes him to cease.  He is silent now, just waiting for the end, as blood drips down and pools chalk thin. Agony builds, muscles strain, and only the gentle pouring rain covers the helpless screaming he's doing when she cuts open his skin in magnificent fury. Intenstines glisten, white bone gleams, and still she ignores the heartfelt screams. He swears he'll never do it again but she says nothing, and stabs him again. He promises he won't ever hurt her, As she turns the hours into all night murder.

      One is one I came up with earlier tonight. well here it is.   Missing you is like missing your heart.  Because without your heart you have no Love.  Without Love you have no emotions that go along with it.  Fear, not there without Love you have nothing to fear about losing.  Anger,You are always Angry at someone you Love, its just you keep that loved locked away for a little bit.  Jealous, you are Jealous of those who get to have the thing you love or loved.  Right now I feel None of these, just blind rage. Dont you see? You drive me crazy, the way you Love and comfort me. But I dont have you right now.  I have no comfort.  I have no Love from you.  You arent alive right now to me. I would let a tear drop but then my memories of you would blur. One thing I am sure I feel is Pain.  The Pain of not having you by my side.  I am lost like a child in the dark, crying for his mother to comfort him, like you once did to me. I feel like a bug that got to close to the beautiful flowers.  Only to be poisoned by something bigger.  Now slowly I am dying.  My only Wish is to have you, with me as I die.  I Miss you Liz!Where ever you are

      This one is called "Our Love" I came up with it this one morning before school.   Our Love is pure.   Our Love is not blind nor selfish.  Our Love is crisp as a spring morning.   Our Love is like the dew on a blade of grass in the morning.   Our Love is red like a rose, bright and livley.  Our Love is bud of a flower waiting to blossom to full potential.   Our Love is untainted.  I Love you Liz! I hope you had a good day
