      I left alot out in my previous posts,like my mom breaking my arm twice as I was in her way, The grapic details of what "He" did to me.Alot of details of my marriage. He had a gambling and drinking problem,we often would not have money for groceries,and I would have to go to local food pantry. But,I always found a way to make sure my kid's had what they needed. He was a total control freak. I could not have any friends,he would call me at work several times during the day to make sure I was there. If the house was not spotless,he would let me have it later. If he was not given sex,it was hell to pay,so to protect us I would just lay there and cry until it was over. He held me up against the wall by my neck one day because I wanted to take the kids to a carnival,and he did not feel like going since he had been out all night.I was going to take them by myself and he freaked. My kid's were right there,and my son who was about 6 at the time,started kicked him and screaming at him to let his mom go. I was soon afterwards that he started telling me that if I ever left him,that he would take the kids and run. And I would never see them again.And that if he couldn't have me no one would.He would often tell me I was ugly,no man would want me ect ect. I became very depressed and finally went to the doctor,they wanted to put me in the hospital that day as they thought I was suicidial.But somehow I convinced them that I would never leave my kids,and they put me on 3 different types of meds. To this day I'm still on two. Gawd It feels like it's going to take me forever to get brought up to date to today.So many things happened after the divorce.So many nights of drinking myself to a stupor when he came and got the kids. Calling into work for 3 days at a time as the depression had set in so bad I couldn't even go out of the house. Financially I was in big trouble.Could not get help from the state,so would have to borrow money to pay the rent or buy groceries. My son is bipolar. I didn't find out what was wrong with him until after I left his dad as I was always told "there is nothing wrong with him,it's YOU,if you can't handle your own son then that is your fault. He would go into a rage for no reason,but then I could handle him,just putting him in a bear hug sitting on the floor with him and holding him down until it passed. Sometimes it would be an hour. But after the divorce it got much worse. He is a big kid,right now is 6'3 and weighs 210 and is only 14. I'm 5'7 and weigh 117 when I've been eating right. During the first year,he was always in a rage,going as far as throwing me against the wall,or throwing me down on the floor and jumping on me and try to strangle me until my daughter would jump on his back. I finally knew I couldn't do it anymore when I went into his room one morning to wake him for school,he woke up,grabbed a baseball bat and missed my head my an inch.I called the police,and they told me to get him to the hospital if I was able. I lied to him and said we were going to get breakfast before school. The whole drive there I kept thinking that they were going to say I was a bad mom,take him away from me ect ect. But once there it took 4 security guards to get him out of the car,then 6 nurses and 2 doctors to strap him to the bed. Then,they called me into a private room,and asked me what he has been doing.I told them everything. The doctor called in a nurse,and gave me a gown,and asked me to put it on. I was very confused,but did it anyway (still hearing my son screaming and saying he was going to kill everyone there in the hallway). When they came back into the room they asked me to let them see the bruises. I was horrified,shocked, I showed them,and hadn't even realized how bad they were.From months of being thrown around,hit,shoved,things thrown at me.I had black and blue marks all over my body.They took pictures,and told me that he has a severe mental problem.That they feel he is a threat to himself and us,and that they were going to send him to a mental facility for evaluation.FINALLY someone knew,someone believed me and I was going to get help. Or I thought anyway. He was there for a week,they gave him anti depressants and sent him on his way. We went to counseling every week,but the meds were not working,I kept telling the DR he's not getting better please help me. The police have been called to our apt several times and they said if they come back again they are taking him. They would walk in,and look right at him and say" what did you do to your mom now". They knew,they saw,but I begged and pleaded with them not to take him. I had promised him on one of his "good days" that we would get thru this and no matter what no one was going to take him from me. He would not be put in a juvienelle home. Maybe a mental hospital for help,but that would be the last extreme. After going thru several doctors,I went in for my own appt with my Dr for my meds,and was reading a health magazine,and there was a huge articile about bi-polar.I was able to check yes to the 50 questions of symptons. My heart raced,I almost felt like I was going to faint. I brought the article in to my Doctor,and told him everything,and said I'm not getting any help with these others...please help me. He went in front of the medical board the next day to get permission from them to treat my son,telling them that he was being passed from Dr. to Dr. and I needed help now. They gave him the ok,and he has since tried 3 different meds.Each working better and better,just 3 weeks ago he increased the dosage of his current med,and the change is remarkable.He still has a little bit of rages,but not as bad as before. His dad still won't admit his son has a mental problem (bi-polar can come from another family member too,and I think his dad might me also) so he tells his friends he just has ADHD.  I'll post more later

      he became a different person then,leaving me at home alone.Going out until 6am. The abuse started about a year after my daughter was born. Both physical and mental. I never told anyone,as all I had heard before was "we would never make it",and I believed that since I never had a dad that my daughter needed one.So I just fought back,trying to keep my family together,enduring the violence,doing my best to keep her away from it. I had my son in 1990.Soon afterwards he took a job where he worked nights,I worked during the day,and at night it was great.Just my kid's and I. His family was all on welfare,doing drugs,causing all kinds of trouble.All of the boys were the same,as their dad was abusive too.So the wives just took it. 13 years later,I woke up one morning,and again had something just "break" inside of me. I made coffee,called my mom,told her I was leaving him and that I needed help in moving out today. I waited for him to wake up,poured his coffee,let him sit down at the table,and looked at him and said "you will never hit me again". He replied by I"ll do whatever the hell I want. And went to punch me,with all of the strenght I had in my body I caught that punch in mid air,held his arm,and looked him straight in the eyes and said " I'll kill you if you lay one hand one me,the kids and I are leaving today,my mom and my brother are on their way over,and the police if needed". He just sat there in total awe.We were moved out by 7pm that day,moved in with my mom.And I filed for divorce the next day.

      One of the neighbors called the police one morning at 1am and told them there were 2 children left home alone all of the time. They gave my mom a break (feeling sorry for her I guess) but told her she needed to find a babysitter. She asked one of her ex-boyfriend's mother to watch us. She was around 70,and we loved her to pieces. But,she soon became ill with cancer,and I remember sitting by her bed and brushing her hair on Christmas eve day, and she turned to me and said "don't ever be alone with him,please he's my son,but don't ever be alone with him". I had no idea what she was talking about of course,expecially since at that time he was good to us,would take us shopping,buy us clothes ect ect. That night I refused to leave,and laid on the floor by her bed,she started to pray like she did every night,except that night she prayed to be taken home,that she could not take the pain anymore,and for God to please protect the children when she was gone. My mother picked us up the next morning,and around 7pm on Christmas day,"he" called and said she had passed away in her sleep. I was devastaed. Nightmares for months,crying in the middle of class. Then one night while we were back at his house,he came into the room where my brother and I slept. That night,is when he started preparing me for what was to come. Touching me,rubbing himself against me,putting porn on the tv,telling me if I ever told anyone that he would do the same to my brother as he was doing to me,and then would kill him. I never told a sole. He started buying me drugs,keeping me high the entire time I was with him. Each night it would be worse,and each time he would get on his knees afterwards,grab me by the neck and force me on my knees saying we had to pray for forgivness. He ended up forcefully raping me on year later. I remember screaming,crying and the more I screamed the more violent he became,punching me in the mouth,finally just putting his whole hand over my mouth to where I could barely breath until he was finished. I ran away the next day and was gone for about a week before the police found me. Beliving every word he said,I still never told anyone.But begged my mom not to send us back there. She did anyway,and it continued until I was 15.He would have huge parties,and tell me to invite all of my school friends,supplying us with the drugs,beer,whatever we wanted. Finally at 15, something broke inside of me.I had enough,and went to his house to get my clothes and any personal items that were there,I had brought 2 of my closet friends (whom I later found out had suspected,but never said anything).He went crazy,while my friends were in the living room,he attacked me in the kitchen.We were fighting like two men would fight,and by the time my friends heard what was going on,he had grabbed a knife off of the counter and was getting ready to stab me in the back. I ran out,went to my friends truck,got his baseball bat,and took it to "his" car,and just went insane.Smashing every window out of his car,beating the car everywhere,screaming that he would never touch me again,and I was going to tell the world and he would never hurt my brother that I would kill him. I ran away that night,and was gone for about a year.Got a job,went back to school,forging my mom's name on all of the papers and thought my life was better. I met a guy from school,that basically "took me in". I wasn't in love with him,but he was with me. His family was very screwed up,his dad was addicted to darvon,and they had to move from state to state in order to get his drug. They decided they were going to move to Cali in 1985,telling me I could go with them.So I packed up my things and did. We got married in Cali in 1986,and I became pregnant with my daughter in 1987.

      Once we got to the city,my mom soon realized that she could not make it just cutting hair.So we at first moved in with a friend she had met who had 2 kids of her own. The oldest was 3 years older than I and we soon became like sisters.I don't remember alot of that move,it didn't last long as they soon started fighting and my mom finally moved out. We moved several times,within those times she went into partership on a bar with that friend we had lived with. By then she had married an evil man.Had a son,and within a month of having him he walked out on her. He hated me with a passion,he didn't work,so during that last summer of him living with us I took alot.I would try to stay out of his way,but if I somehow didn't he would hit me,kick me as I was running up the stairs to my room. Soon,I just stopped coming home until I saw my mom driving down the street at 8pm. She never questioned why I stayed out so late at night,or why he would give me evil looks,or why I would shudder whenever he walked by me. But,he was gone,and we have never to this day heard from him again. So,here is a woman with 2 kids,she can't afford to take care of them,they both have loser dad's that don't come around. She started drinking,bringing a different man home almost everynight after the bar closed. I had to take care of my brother while whe was working.So soon became his mom more or less.I remember him waking up at around 3am,and come crawling into bed with me,as the "moaning" and the bed squeaking would wake him up.So I would cover his ears with my hands so he could go back to sleep,and I would just wait for it to be over so I could drift off to sleep. Once in awhile we would wake up and a strange man would be in our kitchen. Funny,sometimes they knew she had kids and would try to give us money,or be really friendly,but I always steered my brother away from them,and take him outside until they left. I never trusted them,men to me were scary,and I didn't want any part of them. It wasnt until I was 12 that I found out how scary they really could be.

      I have a story to tell. In a fact,while just thinking about it,since I'm a avid book reader, I think this would be a story that I would want to read,just to see how that peroson made it through the things that happened in her life. I, to this day still question that,how did I survive? It was almost like something inside of me took ahold and pulled me through the dark alleys,or turned me down the right road. I want to start from the beginning,mostly to get it out.Then I can start posting on a regular basis,probably not daily,but when the mood strikes...when I feel life has taken a turn and I need to get it out. My mom became pregnant with me at the age of 18.Back then,and living in a small town,she was a curse to our family.She was made to hide out the entire time she was pregnant,then was forced by my Grandmother to give me up for adoption when I was born. That was back in 1969. For some reason,my mom wanted me back (you'll see later why to this day I still question that).So she moved from the small town into the big city, went to beauty school,and when I was 2  1/2 she went back to court and told them she could take care of me now,and since by then I was in and out of foster homes,the state was glad to get me off of their list. I didn't find out about the above until 2 years ago,and it broke my heart.My Grandparents have always been there for me,I've always kept them on the highest pedestal there is.To me they were perfect.But,within the last 4 years I have had to learn that hard way that they are not. I still love them with all of my heart,and even understand why my Grandmother did what she did.I can't imagine what they were going thru back then.And have forgiven them. When she first got me back, my Grandmother was furious,and refused to come see me.But my Grandfather had to see his first Grandchild,and would come see me every week. Bringing me presents,sitting with me and reading me stories,helping my mom with money and groceries. I don't even know how it came about that I finally met my Grandmother.But,after she did she fell instantly in love with me,and since then I have always been their favorite.Spoiled to the hilt with them. They were the only ones in my life that I knew truly loved me,and I would often call them or ask my mother to call them so I could go stay with them on the farm. My Uncles would take me everywhere with them,my Grandfather taught me how to drive a tractor,and I would stay out in the fields with him all day long. When I wasn't with my Grandparents my life was alot different. I remember feeling like I was always in the way with my mom. So I learned to "disappear" until it was time for supper,then I would take my shower and go to bed right away. I didn't have many friends back then as I was very shy,so I found places to hide out,often with the horses,they would find me sometimes late at night in the barn as I had fallen asleep in the hay. Amazing as I know have 2 kids of my own,and I know where they are every second. I can't imagine not knowing where you child is,having them gone all day. I don't remember birthday parties,I dont' remember Christmas. Maybe I have blocked all of those things out. Sometimes things will come back to me,little things about my childhood,But when my kids ask me to tell them about my childhood,I have to tell them that I don't remember it. They don't understand at all,as they have so many memories,and I hope that they have alot of great memories when they are older and can tell their own children about them. When I was 11 we moved back to the city.That was when my life took a nightmarish turn,a turn that forever changed me,somedays for the worst,other days it makes me stronger.
