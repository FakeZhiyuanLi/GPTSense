						   "Like massive tax cuts for the wealthy, wiping out overtime pay for workers goes against American values, and serves only the interests of the wealthy at the expense of hard-working Americans. The willingness of the Bush administration to turn its back on working Americans stands in clear contrast to the Kerry-Edwards economic plan which aims to strengthen the economy by putting middle-class families first."  --John Edwards August 21, 2004

						   Today, at work, I handled a document for someone who claimed that the wounds John Kerry received in Vietnam were "minor wounds", and that he didn't deserve the awards he was given for them. To anyone who actually thinks this, I offer a deal: I will shoot you in the arm, and then you tell me that what you are feeling is a "minor wound".  I've seen gunshot wounds, helped sew them up. No gunshot is a minor wound. They  hurt , and they are life-threatening, whether from blood loss, massive trauma, or infection. To refer to such a thing as minor is to expose one's own ignorance of such things.  On a related note: I have also noticed that the Shrub campaign is doing a good job of keeping the press focused on Kerry's war record, rather than their own boy's. They'd better keep that up too, because we already know what his record is: he is a DESERTER. They used to execute people for that.

						   I forgot to wear my watch yesterday. I hadn't realized how addicted to time I had become. I kept finding myself moving around whatever room I happened to be in, so I could see a clock.

						     Lies about Halliburton's activities  Another fact that would seem particularly embarrassing to an administration who made such a show of the evil of Saddam Hussein was the revelation that Dick Cheney was doing business with him at Halliburton. Of course, he was embarrassed to admit it was true, so he lied and said it wasn't. It was. From a  urlLink  report   by  Counterpunch , March 19, 2003. 				   				      During the 2000 presidential campaign, Cheney adamantly denied such dealings. While he acknowledged that his company did business with Libya and Iran through foreign subsidiaries, Cheney said, "Iraq's different." He claimed that he imposed a "firm policy" prohibiting any unit of Halliburton against trading with Iraq.  "I had a firm policy that we wouldn't do anything in Iraq, even arrangements that were supposedly legal," Cheney said on the ABC-TV news program "This Week" on July 30, 2000. "We've not done any business in Iraq since U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990, and I had a standing policy that I wouldn't do that."  The Washington Post first reported Halliburton's trade with Iraq in February 2000. But U.N. records obtained by The Post two years ago showed that the dealings were more extensive than originally reported and than Vice President Cheney has acknowledged.

						     Lies about ties to Halliburton  Some folks were worried that a Secretary of Defense who becomes the CEO of a defense contractor and then becomes the Vice President might present a conflict of interest--particularly if he was still on that contractor's payroll. Not to worry, said Cheney, I'm off the clock. Except that he wasn't. From a Boston  Globe   urlLink  report   on September 9, 2003:  				   				      "Since I left Halliburton to become George Bush's vice president, I've severed all my ties with the company, gotten rid of all my financial interests. I have no financial interest in Halliburton of any kind and haven't had now, for over three years."  Within 48 hours, Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey pointed reporters toward Cheney's public financial disclosure sheets filed with the US Office of Government Ethics. The sheets show that in 2002, Cheney received $162,392 in deferred salary from Halliburton, the oil and military contracting company he ran before running for vice president. In 2001, Cheney received $205,298 in deferred salary from Halliburton.  The 2001 salary was more than Cheney's vice presidential salary of $198,600. Cheney also is still holding 433,333 stock options.  Flushed into the open, Cheney spokeswoman Catherine Martin said the vice president will continue to receive about $150,000 a year from Halliburton in 2003, 2004, and 2005. If President bush wins a second term, that means Cheney will make at least $800,000 from the company while sitting in office.

						    A long article in Fridayâ€™s New York Times reveals the real players behind the so-called 'Swift Boat Veterans for Truth' and details the inconsistencies and contradictions in their stories about John Kerry's record in Vietnam.       "Records show that the group received the bulk of its initial financing from two men with ties to the president and his family - one a longtime political associate of Mr. Rove's, the other a trustee of the foundation for Mr. Bush's father's presidential library. A Texas publicist who once helped prepare Mr. Bush's father for his debate when he was running for vice president provided them with strategic advice. And the group's television commercial was produced by the same team that made the devastating ad mocking Michael S. Dukakis in an oversized tank helmet when he and Mr. Bush's father faced off in the 1988 presidential election.     The strategy the veterans devised would ultimately paint John Kerry the war hero as John Kerry the 'baby killer' and the fabricator of the events that resulted in his war medals. But on close examination, the accounts of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth' prove to be riddled with inconsistencies. In many cases, material offered as proof by these veterans is undercut by official Navy records and the men's own statements.    Several of those now declaring Mr. Kerry 'unfit' had lavished praise on him, some as recently as last year."  -Air America Radio

						   The Republican National Convention is about to happen. Yet another televised beheading. In the meantime, a Republican congressman from Nebraska is now calling saying that the alleged president mishandled the Iraq war, and that it shouldn't have happened anyway. Cracks are appearing in the legendarily united party.  And who can blame them? Cheney spewing profanity everywhere he goes, Bush flipping off teenagers, a constant barrage of negative campaign attack ads. The continued focus on Iraq, when we have problems here in this country that go largely ignored, such as the collapsing economy. To say nothing of the forgotten war in Afghanistan.  Oh yeah, and the memos that have come to light from within the administration advocating torture, and finding creepy little ways to justify it.  Shrub also refuses to condemn the Swift Boat Veterans television ad, attacking John Kerry's heroic service in Vietnam.  It seems there might still be politicians in the Republican party who see problems with this kind of behavior. Either that, or they realize they are on a sinking ship...   Current election projection: Kerry= 327 electoral votes (51.3% of popular vote), Bush= 211 electoral votes (46.9% of popular vote)

						   There is every probability that I will continually contradict myself in this record. Hopefully, this not a product of muddled thinking. I prefer to think of it as a product of a medium that is well-suited to stream-of-consciousness writing, and which allows me to simply ramble aimlessly on. I intend to make the most of it.

						   Does it really matter? There are too many people I know who don't seem to think so. They say that there are no real choices. They see little difference between candidates; the hot issues of the day don't really affect them, they say.  How could I disagree any more? There is such a culture of apathy in this country. The difference between having no choice, and choosing not to exercise the privilege of making that choice known, is so tiny as to be insignificant. If you don't choose, you don't deserve the privilege, anyway.  Of course it matters. There are few things in life that matter more. Here is what I am talking about: In Venezuela, just a couple of days ago, Hugo Chavez won a referendum on his Presidency. Voter turnout was something like 90%. In this country, we are lucky to get 40%. That is pathetic. If the same kind of apathy were at work in Venezuela, right now there would be chaos. But, in constitutional terms, Venezuela is a brand new country. They only put together their constitution about a decade ago, and there is still great love of democracy there.  Not necessarily so, here. We claim to be the Land of the Free. Part of that freedom, I suppose, is the right to choose whether to vote. There are problems with this: Voting is the basis of democracy. If you aren't voting, you aren't participating in democracy. This means that you don't live in a democracy.  Germany in the 1930's allowed their democracy to be taken away by a screaming lunatic, because no one would stand up and protect the weak in that country. There are few things that are more basic to a democratic society than the protection of those who cannot protect themselves. Give that up, and you give up your right to self-determination, because when it comes your time in the weak position, you also will be left to die.  There is nothing so pathetic than a people who will not fight for that right to self-determination. 40% is not a good number. A people with so little grasp of what it means to live in a free society does not deserve to live in that society.
