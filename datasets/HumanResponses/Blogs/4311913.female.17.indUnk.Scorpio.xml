                who's that someone thats worth loving for you? the person that u think u hv that special connection with or that someone thats willing to do whatever for you no matter if you like them back or not? last summer i met the one guy that is willing to do anything for me, i mean ANYTHING. it was quite unexpected. all through my life its mostly me developing crushes on others rather than others developing any feelings at all for me. and if so, the guy that actually likes me are usually not the ones i would ever like.                 we were in the same school for almost a year before we started talking. it wasnt till almost the end of the school year that he started talking to me a lot. this was in grade eleven, and back then i had a lot of spares in the afternoon. that year my dad was in an accident at work and as a result i had to do most of the stuffs at home because the rest of my family weren't in canada. sometimes when i went to downtown to pay for some bills, DY, this guy would come along with me because he had spares too. at first i thought he just wanted to be friends with me, cuz i could never imagine that someone like him would ever like me. but once my friend said to me, "you do know that he likes you right?" and i was really shocked. i didnt really believe it till a long time after. he bought me a lot of presents, asked me to go for dinner with him and stuff. i dont know why but i just never had that feeling for him back. he seemed like such a complicated person for me. im a person who cares a lot about school and family and my future, but he never seemed to care about school, he does care about his family i guess. but for me it was hard to accept a guy that doesnt care about school or his future. he always made me feel so important, but then at times i felt like i wasnt getting enough air. he bought me flowers for valentines day and i was so happy. it was my first valentines day that i actually receieved flowers on. i finally felt somehting for him, but it was then, that i talked to my friend. he asked me what i thought about DY, i then i finally woke up realizing that things would just never work out between us. i felt really bad but i knew i had to let him know before he thinks that he has a chance, i started ignoring his calls. i know this was the only way that i could let him understand cuz even if i told him i dont like him he would still do the thngs he does. this went on for a year, and still going on.
