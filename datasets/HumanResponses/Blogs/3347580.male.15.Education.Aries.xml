      What a disaster... my section lost another member due to their parents. Now there are no more sec 2s in my fhorn section!!! AHHH!!! The first sec 1 (now sec 2) to quit was Hayati because of her parents i guess. Then today it was revealed that Ain, another sec 2, is considered a band quitter because of her parents who don't allow her to go to band because of MYE results. Of all the time in the world to quit band! Fhorn section is diving into a deep ravine, unless me, marcus & penny train up the 2 sec 1s very hard for competition, cause we might be bringing either one to SYF 2005 Indoor Band Competition and one of them might be the SL next year after we (Me, Marcus & Penny) step down.  Oh, and sentence of the day from Faris the flutist in my band : "Stand there collecting dust... by the time finish already got cobwebs!"  Fish signing out

      No blog for yesterday. Why? Too happy because MYE 2004 is over. Naturally.... :-P. Going to M.A.S.T Music tomorrow to ask around if they sell french horn hand guards. I'm really hankering after one of those, before the holding area starts going bad. That would be disastrous wouldn't it?  Fish signing out

      Went to do a bit of window shopping at Tampines Mall today. Of course, I made a beeline for the Yamaha outlet there. Breezed through the instrument prices and the accessories. If I want my own horn, I'd have to save up for 50 freaking months!! Freak!!! By then i'll be like, 20 years old T_T. I now have 20 bucks, and i need at least 36 more to buy that new Denis Wick french horn mouthpiece. Well, doesn't take that long to save that much.  Anyhoo, eyebags are developing under my eyes, courtesy to the Exam Syndrome. However, the consolation is that MYE 2004 for me will end off with Sub Physics, and that is tomorrow! Then can paint the town red already!! ^_^  Fish signing out

      Very funny ah Jun Hao and Wei Han. Go suan me than still can laugh... T_T... nvm, you'll get justice. Anyways, today's SS paper not that bad lah. The SEQ was just memory work but Section A was a bit of a challenge. Had a hard time to identify the common issue between Sources B & C! AhhH!! I'm gonna practice somemore on my french horn to train high notes using a big mouthpiece, then can die happy ;-).  Fish siging out

      Ahhh!! My new stand got a scratch!!.... so drama. Anyways, just finished polishing not even 3/4 of my french horn. Very the ma fan le... anyone volunteer to polish it for me? Hehe ;-P. Tomorrow is Social Studies and I more or less studied the whole chunk of it. Why not test on Bloody Sunday? I like that part.. sure get full marks one. So confident! Lucky the duration is only 1 hour, if not can rot for 2 1/2 hours T_T...  Fish signing out

      Ah... Mast Music is closed today. How convenient T_T.... so I went to Yamaha Thomson Plaza instead. They only sell the ones that OPMB's percussion use, and not the one I want, but it'll have to do. I'm dazzled at the band instruments on display. The Yamaha YSL350C Trombone really caught my eye... maybe i'd like to buy it, hehe ;-p. But it costs SGD$1.8k, so i'll save up.  Fish signing out.

      Only left Social Studies and Physics (Combined),  Monday and Tuesday respectively.... THEN CAN BURN HALF YEAR'S WORTH OF NOTES!!! WEEEE!!  Lame, right? Anyways, I'm buying my own music stand from Mast Music today. I'm picking a black one. And possibly i'll be searching for a french horn hand guard as well. But who wants to know? I've got few activities lined up after MYE. Going for Raffles Institution Military Band's Prometheum X on the 20th of May with Yi Hao (VS Concert Band), watching movies, wasting time away, yadda yadda yadda.... anything else to say? Nope. Lastly, good luck to all OPSS students for your remaining papers and your MYE results.  Fish signing out. ;-)

      Back from band camp... now i have lots of stuff to tell over the past 4 days i'm imprisoned in school!   Day 1:   I actually proposed my group name to be "P.R.A.M" but the rest didn't agree. My group consist of Me ( FH ), Si Hui ( Cl ), Rei Kun ( Tba ), Jia Min ( Tb ), Clarissa ( Cl ), Cynthia ( Tpt ), Yu Jia ( Perc ) & Kai Xin ( TSx ). We had Sebastian ( Perc ) and Le Qi ( ASx ) as our Sec 4 supervisors. The "Wild Goose Chase" game was satisfactory, though i must say that 2 stations were easy to pass. After lights out, my roommates, boys from group 2,4,6 & 8, couldn't sleep.. naturally! Our 1st night mah. Anyhoo, me, shannon, othman & daryl trash-talked about everything and anything that came to mind. In the end i only managed to catch 30 mins worth of sleep.   Day 2:   Breakfast arrived late, which was only two pieces of bread with jam. After that was marching & exercising. I was made the timer at one point, but not for long anyways. After that was sectionals i think.. then came lunch, which i was sure rice with something and nuggets. After that was games (Captain's Ball). By that time the sun was directly overhead and we were made to play between groups in the glaring sunlight. At night, lots of members were struck with headaches and other ailments, due to excessive running around in the strong heat of the sun. Then after music rehearsal we played "Mysterious Trail", which is a odd game, in my opinion. I immediately fell asleep before lights were out. I found out that Daryl, Shannon & Othman talked about Geylang (of all places?) and mamasans.   Day 3:   As expected, breakfast was STILL two pieces of bread with jam. Shortly after Mr Tan brought us running outside to OCC and Seletar Reservoir. Upper or Lower also i don't know, and I don't care. We came back, only to find the GB girls had locked us out... of all the nerve! We had music rehearsal later on, followed by sectionals. Like before, lunch came late and Cynthia nearly vomitted everything out. Then we had music rehearsal somemore, along with with Mr Terence Teow, a flutist from WestWinds, who will be our guest player for the upcoming concert. Around 8 pm like that, we had our last group discussion about our cheer and rhythm, for the Group Presentation later on. Surprisingly, I found out that our group had scored 8/10 for rhythm! We tied with group 4 at 3rd placing for the competition. We had a bit of pizza which Ben's mother had treated us to (Ben is the DM). We all slept like a log, cause we don't have any topic to discuss... (Obviously..)   Day 4:   Breakfast is still two piece of bread, but with scrambled eggs and a slice of cucumber. Then we had ensemble practice, brasses in the hall and woodwinds in the music room, followed by 25 mins, sectional and combined for brasses. Not much events that time, we gathered in the music room, debriefing, notices, blah blah blah... and we're dismissed at exactly 12 pm. However, Sebas, Daryl & I went to McDonald's to makan (who wouldn't want after 4 days straight of a strict diet) with Shirley & Esther from Euphonium. Out of the blue, the mamasan with the mole joke came up and we were like laughing our heads off. When walking to the bus stop at Sebas's block, he kept coming up with tune titled "The Mamasans of Singapore" and such... the weather was dam bloody hot seh, so were forced to take refuge under one of the void decks. T_T  I must say the camp is satisfactory.. but I'm looking forward to the December camp later on. ;-P  Fish signing out
