      La La La! I'm back from Thanksgiving at my grandma's.   Trevor asked me to Christmas at his grandma's house. It's about two hours away and we'd probably have to stay the night. Is that strange? My mom, of course, isn't too keen on the idea. We'dd be in separate rooms and we won't do anything.  We did hold hands tho. *smile*   Do you think I should be able to go to Trevor's grandma's for Christmas?  BTW, It's their family Christmas celebration but it's on the 13th of December, so I wouldn't miss my own celebration.

      Hooray! But still crap. I missed school today cause I was too dizzy to stand and walk. I don't have a fever anymore, and I don't know why I did in the first place. But I'm still going to my boyfriend's school's last football game of the season, or post-season or whatever. It's a playoff game. He's on the football team but he won't be playing. I'm still going, I guess to see him stand there. That is if I can stand. I didn't tell him I missed school today but only because he didn't have time to talk at all. I think he was calling from football practice. That's gotta suck. But his mom was at first supposed to pick me up, and buy my ticket, and sit with me. Now she's only sitting with me because she's getting there late and can't pick me up. Remember, I don't go to this school, I really don't know anyone and I'm still going. I'll probably sit with some people that I met at his church last Wednesday, but of course I have to find them. Oh yeah, and I have to try to stay standing, literally. Still, I'm going. I know there's really nothing he can do about this... at all. I really don't blame him, I want to see him. I just hope if I fall someone can catch me, if he's not right there. That's all for today. I have to go to the football game.

      Damn it. I just lost my post. Damn it.   So here's the story again. For the second time. I was almost done too.   I talk ed to my boyfriend's sister last night. I was negotiating his online time, you know cause she controls the computer. Not saying that's a bad thing; I control the computer at my hosue and I "allow" my brother to use it every once in a while. So I'm trying to appeal to her... sisterly senses. Not working tho. She's a year older than me. My boyfriend's two years older. Kinda scared my mom... anyway, I digress. So she's like "I'm older and you're... stupid," or something that meant that. And I was like "Yeah, you're older but you wouldn't know it." Sadly she didn't catch the insult. Just proves my point. So she hates me. But I blocked her so we're even. And then she got off and Trevor got on. *smile* So we talked. I went to his church yesterday too, as I have... well this is only the second Wednesday but still.   I'm happy. My self-esteem is up. Boyfriends will do that to you. Lol.   Also I have an ear problem wher I get vertigo and can't stand up every once in a while. It's a pressure thing. But yeah, it's happening again. It has to do with the humiditiy and pressure this time. I've always been able to feel pressure changes; like if someone opens a door realy quickly next to me, I can feel it in the pressure. Yeah. I'm a wierdo, I know. But it's something I'll always have to live with. It makes me feel like the whole world is spinning and I'll try to stand up strait and balance but I can't. Eventually I just close my eyes and fall over. But I hear it hilarious to watch. I'll just be swaying and reaching out for things to hold me up while the rest of the world just looks on in dismay. Then of course when I fall the pressure changes really rapidly cause of like altitude changes so it takes me a while to get back upright.  But yeah, that's happening again. Bad. But I'm trying to cope with it.

      Okay. Now my boyfriend says that he didn't say ANYTHING. I believe him. But it's weird. You here's the story:  I was talking to Trev, my bf, last night and we were talking about bad things we'd done in our past, but not specifically. Jsut agreeing not to ask each other about them and accpet the fact of not knowing everything. You get it?  Anyway the next day, his best friend IMs me asking if I've ever shoot up heroine. (Which I don't and never have, btw.) It was really wierd. And I wondered for a minute if he shot up heroine or if Trev did or does. Really scarey thoughts. See Trev had told me the past night that wahtever I did in the past could never be as bad as what he did, times ten. So maybe he shot up heroine, I thought. Which still wouldn't be as bad as mine, in my opinion. But still that scared me. But it's in the past.  Okay... now he says he never did any drugs at all ever. Good thing. Me either. Life is good again. Aaaawww. He wants to come see me. How sweet. Ok then. Cool.

      Oh... cool. I think it worked. Although it's not 4:47 pm. It's like 7 something. Weird. But seeing as this is a kind of journal, here goes:  I'm talking to my new boyfriend right now. He's great. Really really sweet. But we're going through things. Nothing much, just that whole boyfriend/girlfriend/best friends of each thing. It's weird. It's this whole thing with shooting up heroine and stuff. I don't get it.

      Is this working? I hope so.  A lot of my friends have blogs so in an effort to keep up with the times I gotten one too. I know, I know it's totally keeping up with the Joneses but still. It's kinda fun. That is if this works. Let's see.

      I'm much less depressed today, tho quite a bit more sick. It's just a head cold. And I'm still going caroling in the cold weather with Trevor's chruch. I'm very very glad I'll get to see him. I miss him. But I'm not depressed.  Today was the first day of exams. I had World Histroy and Math, both were easier than I thought they were going to be. That's good. I got finished with my math exam a whole hour and a half early. I was so bored so I wrote one of those letters that you'll never give to the person, to Trevor. That's okay. It's three pages long. Took up a lot of time. I told him some of the things I'll never bring myself to tell him in person, at least not yet. Of course he'll never see that note. That whole note took up about an hour. Then I played solitaire on my teacher's computer. See... I could have gone to LotR:RotK with Trevor; but no. Ugh. I don't think he ended up going anyway. He has wrestling and then he's coming to church for some hearty caroling. *smile*

      I'm really depressed. Exams are coming up and that's bad and very stressful. But I'm just really missing Trevor. I spent like twelve hours with him this weekend and I was really high because of it yesterday, but today I'm just really missing him. I want to see him. And then my friend Jessie was talking to me and saying stuff like "Oh, I love my new boyfriend" and "We're going to see Lord of The Rings tomorrow." It really depressed me even more. And then Spanish was last period and that's always depressing. I don't know if that's the only thing that's making me depressed. I'm just pretty down. I know I really like Trevor and I want to see him. Not that I'd be completely happy if I saw him but I'd enjoy seeing him.  A while back his mom forgot to pick him up at school after practice and he had to walk home in the rain, almost 4 miles! He came over to my house and we talked for while and cause he had had an obviously really bad day. Well, if I could only have one extra day to see him... a week I guess; I'd pick today. Cause I'm that depressed and sad and just down right sad.  But then again I'm gonna have a dulcimer to play and that's cool. Cause Patrick's coming over to get my brother's old guitar and amp and in exchange he's buying me new dulcimer strings. Hooray! Hooray for Patrick. So then I'll be happily occupied with playing my dulcimer.  But for now I'm sad. Except that Anna told me some pretty funny stories about her and Patrick and some awkward moments.

      I'm so totally happy. So happy. Today's Sunday; on Friday Trevor called me up and asked "do you want to go to the movies tonight?" "Uh... sure. Lemme ask." So we went to the movies and Dixieland and Wal-mart and Krystle. Oh well, we saw Duplex with Ben Stiller and Drew Berrymore. Pretty good movie. Great person to see it with.  Then, as planned, yesterday I went to Alabama with him and his family. His mom and his mom's fianc√©, they sat in the front, and me and Trevor and Trevor's sister in the three to a seat back seat. A little cramped. But now I understand perfectly what Anna was talking about when she said, you don't really want any personal space with your boyfriend. *smile* Two hours there and back plus about six hours actually there. Fun stuff. I met a whole bunch of people, his family. I learned where he's tickleish. Good stuff. But the really fun part was on the ride home. His sister had a really bad headache so we couldn't talk much. Tell me: what do you do when you're squeezed in the back seat of a car with your boyfriend for two hours? Well, you play footsie, of course. That and hold hands and play with each other's hands. Man... that's fun. We even went for thumb wrestling while holding hands and 'twas great fun. And we messed around with each other's hands, more him than me, not that I minded. He like felt me up, only my hand. There's no better way to explain it. It's like he's searching my hand.. figuring it out. He's awesomely sweet. And there was some... stroking and uh, squeezing. I'm so happy. Those were the best two hours I've had in a long time. And I didn't really know where I was half the time and he was holding my hands and I was truely happy to be lost and happy and with him. It's a really awsome feeling. I'm so lucky to have such a great boyfriend. All the marauders are lucky. We all have such great boyfriends; Anna and Pat, Tiffany and Taylor, Char and noone... she's so happy tho.  I'm so happy. So truly happy. But I do miss him. And he's wearing the shirt I got him for Christmas and I love my stuffed Geoffery the Giraffe from Toys-R-Us. I so happy. Like truely, truely happy. I so happy that my boyfriend is that guy with a mullet and a chipped tooth and is totally insane. I'm so happy Trevor is my boyfriend.

      UGH! Today was total crap. Of course it's not over yet, it can get worse. Technically it can get better, too but I doubt it will.  First my history teacher is a really smart person and he's nice and all but he's really annoying... all the time. And I have two tests and a quiz left to make up from him from when I was absent for three days in a row and some other time. I keep asking him when he wants me to come in and make them up but he's like "Whenever." I'm the kind of person where if you don't tell me a date I'll schedule over it. So I either keep forgeting a scheduling over it or just no bothering to remember in the first place. He's driving me nuts. And my friend Anna keeps reminding me that I need to schedule those make up days, but I never really do.  Also my math teacher... God, she's driving me nuts. I really want to exempt that exam and it's forth period, which is December 17th which means I could go see LotR:RotK. And Trevor also had that period off, exempting that exam so we were gonna go together and see the movie and get lunch or something, like our first date. So cool. We've been going out for a month, I checked last night. We've been going out a month and we've never gone on an actual date, like to the movies and dinner or anything. Is that normal?  But anyway... my stupid math teacher. I have a 94.0, and you have to have a 95 to exempt. Grrr, most teachers will let you give extra credit or something, but no. AND.. I have a 100 point test in there tomorrow and it's gonna be so easy and I'm sure to do really well on it, but no... she won't count that into the grade for exemptions. GRRR.... she makes me sooo mad. I'm fuming.  On top of all that, I had the palying part of my band exam today. Now I suck, I really suck at band and I know it. I accept it. That's fine. But I still don't won't to fail my exam. And band is right after math so I'm already fuming. I had four scales out ten that I knew, I knew. Four scale, I could ace those. Two scales that I was just gonna say, "Mr. King I can't play those scales" on. That's fine. And 3 scales that I was gonna muddle through. If you miss five mistakes on a scale he tells you, "stop, go on to the next scale." I totally bombed the 3 that I was okay on and I totally bombed 2 of the 4 scales I did know. I was so nervous. I hated it. Now, Mr. King's an asshole anyway but he really graded hard on this. Pat... he's actually good. He's first chair, and he makes 90-100 on all his chair tests. Pat.. made a 29 out of 50. He was on the verge of tears. Imagine this 6'3" guy standing there, in awe, almost crying cause he failed a band exam. That's really mean of Mr. King. He's an asshole naturally. Everyone hates him.  So... nevertheless my day was totally maddening. I'm totally... enraged and really down right pissed.  I actually hope Trevor doesn't call. Cause if he does I'll end up ranting totally to him, and I don't want to put him through that. Otherwise... call on.  Goodbye, Goodnight. *sob* No more FIF.

      I'm back from the dead. I've been still sick but getting better still. Now, of course, Trevor's sick. I didn't do it. I really didn't. I haven't seen him. *sob* I'm getting better pretty well.  Exams are coming up. The work is piling up ahead of me, and yet my teachers aren't really piling it up. Idk.  But I'm happy. I have the family Christmas with Trevor's family this Saturday. I'm going to the movies with him Wednesday of next week. And there's another friend's Christmas party on Friday of that week. And then Simon and Garfunkel!~ Hooray! ~

      Gah. I'm tired and sick. My dad wanted to pick me up today, but I was too sick. Not really a problem tho. Cause I'm here. I think I'm dying but I'm still here. I'll be ok. Especially if Trevor gets on tonight. Then I'd be totally fine. Lol.   But my friends Anna and Pat... I think Anna's overreacting a bit.  Who do you think should come first, boyfriends or girlfriends or best friends?  Somehow I'm leaning towards best friends because you can less easily break up with a best friend than a boyfriend or girlfriend.  IDK. But yeah Trevor might get on tonight! Hooray!

      I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I need to get better. I know I'll only get worse at Dad's. It's his weekend again. And Trevor says he's coming over to my house on Sunday whether I'm sick or not. He's invicible, he's not going to get sick. Laugh. I told him that I missed him and there wasn't much I wanted to do to stop him from coming over but that I'm sick and I don't want him to get sick. But I'm not stopping him much cause I really want to see him.  Anyway, about Christmas at his grandma's: My parents are in a court case over the custody of me and my brother. Mom says I can't go to Trevor's grandma's for a Christmas thing because it'd look bad in court. That's gay. "And you let your daughter go to Alabama with a 17 year old boy!" I'm sick and tired of doing something or not doing something to please the courts. It's so damn annoying.  So I hope I get better in time for Trevor to come over on Sunday so he won't get sick too.   Also my best friend, Anna and her boyfriend, Pat are... oh I don't know. But I'm their "relationship counseler." I'm trying to figure out Pat's problems. I know Anna's cause I talk to her more cause she's my best friend naturally.

      So I'm sick as a dog and tired and feverish and I'm only online so I might get to talk to Talyor, Trevor's friend, who might be taking him to chruch. If he doesn't take him, he'll at least be there and can give him a message for me. I hope I get a message to him. He's got a wrestling meet at 5:30 and will have to rush to even make any of church. I don't want him to rush if he doesn't have to. He likes chruch, but he has a paper to do and he's only coming cause he thinks I'll be there. I don't want him to have to rush for almost nothing. And then he'll want to come see me and I can't let him do that. I'm sick. I don't want him to get sick. I feel really really crappy, I don't want him feeling really really crappy too. If he comes over he'll want to hug me and comfort me and that'd make him sick too. Hince the badness of him coming over. That's all. Goodbye, Goodnight.

      At home sick. Like I think I said I've had a fever. And I ache all over and I'm tired and I feel like I'm going to throw up. Fun stuff. Not. But this just means that I'm not going to Trevor's chruch tonight. That's ok. I don't want him to get sick. Not that we're kissing and it's mono or anything. I think it's the flu. Sucks. But chances are that if his wrestling match starts at 5:30 and chruch is at 7, he's not gonna make it anyway.So that's okay. I'll call him or his mom later after most of the not sick people are home. Someone's bound to be there. I'll tell his mom and his friend Talyor, who might be picking him up and taking to chruch after the match.  So that's the news. I'm too tired to talk anymore. Or type, whatever.

      I'm happy. Giddy almost. Tow of my bestest best friends have wonderful boyfriends and so do I, of course. And my other best friend likes someone... so what if he's a real jerk.  Appearentally he's nice to her. And I got a puppy. Or my little brother did. He's 12 almost 13. She's 2/3 German shepard and 1/3 Rottwiller. Her name is Nickels. Don't ask, my brother named her. She was born on Halloween.  She's so cute.  Trevor called me again today. Hooray!

      Hooray!  All my fears and worries are unjustified and stupid! I called Trevor and the onloy thing that happened was that he failed his English paper and now has to go over it with a fine tooth comb with his dad. He'll be doing that all week and won't be able to see me, but that's okay cause he said he really misses me and wants to see me. Maybe we can go somewhere on Friday. No wait, I think he has a wrestling match. That sucks.  Oh crap. It's my dad's weekend. My parents are divorced. So I spend every other weekend with my dad. I really strongly dislike my dad. And I don't really want Trevor to meet my dad. He's not that greatest person, you know how that goes. So if I go to the movies with Trevor over the weekend Trevor and dad would probably meet. But at this point I wouldn't care as long as to se Trevor. So, I don't know. It'd be worth it just to get to see Trevor.  You don't understand. I was gone for a week and then I won't get to see him for another week. I miss him.   Also my almost 13 year old brother, Ty, got a new puppy.  2/3 German shepard and 1/3 Rotwiller. It's so tiny. But of course it's gonna be huge. It's named Nickels. He's weird. The dog is a she btw. And so cute. We already have Daisy the now six year old half Jack Russel Terrier. She's getting a little jealous. But Nickels is sooo cute.

      Hmmm... I think Trevor and I are... drifting. That's really bad I know. I told one of my friends and she's like almost crying. I don't want to break up with him and I still like him and stuff. But we're drifting. I don't like it, but I can't seem to stop it.  But in the mean time: I need to get him a Christmas present.  I'm happy for the moment cause I've made plans to go to the movies. It's this gay little triple date thing with me and my two best friends and their boyfriends. But as this story is playing out it looks like it's gonna be Love Actually on Thursday. Good movie. But it also looks like Faye's bf may not be able to come. *sob* Oh well. That means that our other friend, Char, can come and she really wants to see that movie.  DAng.. And now Faye's complaining cause it's a chick-flick. *sigh* I'm trying here. We're still figuring it out. Whatevs. Bye.

      Gah... court today. The judge took me and my brother into the back into the "judge's chambers" and talked to us about everything. He little bit biased and one-sided. He asked us what was the best and worst things about your mom and dad. We told him that mom tells us everything. He seems really... bad about that. It annoys me. But it ends up that we're living at my dad's house until our next court date. It's a trial period to see if we understand what it's going to be like to live at Dad's permanantly. Make sense? So I'm living at my dad's which is only about ten miles away from Mom's so I'm still going to the same school and seeing my friends and stuff. It still hasn't hit me that I'm living at my dad's fro mthe next three and a half months.

      Ugh. Today was... another day. Got report cards today. Only they wouldn't give me mine because they said I had an obligation for my Spanish book. But I already turned in my Spanish book. So I had to stay after and talk to five different people and try to get it sorted out. In the end I just signed my life away in blood and got my report card. It's imperative that I got it today because court is Wednesday. It's a deciding factor in where we live. And today after school I was so pissed that I just said "chocolate and books." That's what I needed; chocolate and books. So I went to Books-A-Million. That's always fun. But I couldn't do what I wanted to do; stay there and read some of a good book while still in the store. Of course, Books-A-Million doesn't encourage that as much as Barnes and Noble. I gotta get to B&N. Soon.. soon. But I did get Trevor's brithday present. I got the book called, Taking the Blue Pill, Philosophy and Religion Behind the Matrix. God I hope he doesn't have it. And his dad's trying to plan a surprise party this Friday but he knows about it. I have to talk to Tiffany and Taylor, see if they can go. I gotta round up the people.

      *sigh* Got good news and bad news.  I told, my boyfriend, Trevor something really bad that's happening to me. Like really bad and I had to leave me house and he came to get me, basically escaping me problems. So I spent the night at my best friend's house and we talked a lot. I still know nothing but it helped.But Trevor didn't take it the same way I'd expected. He's never had to deal with anything lioke it in his own life and he's always like my mom and this changed his opinion of my mom. And he's always seen me as innocent, which he now knows I'm definately not. He's really totally wonderful and really one of the nicest people I know. He's all wanting to come take me away from here. So sweet. He's really awesome. But I'm afraid I really scared him, a lot. And he's not truely mad at me, I don't think, but he's wierded out and he's thinking and he's still sorting things out in his head. I think that he cares about a lot and whereas most of my other friends who knwo about this really didn't know what to do, he's gonna spend hours trying to think of something to do. But there's nothing that can be done. I've tried. There's nothing. The only thing he can do is just be there for me, mainly as a source of transportation but definately as a moral supporter too. He's really really good at making me feel better and he's always there for me when I need him and he makes me happy. That's all, at least right now.

      Ugh... it's been a while. Dang, it's been a long while. Lots has happened, actually.  Uh, a run through: Anna and Patrick broke up... mainly because Pat thought she wasn't a Christain and that's all screwed up.  Trevor kissed my cheek and once my neck... *smile* And me and Trevor pulled a Tiffany and Taylor all today.  Pulling a Tiffany and Taylor is named after two of my friends who make out all the time and have several times fallen asleep in each other's arm, etc. Me and Trevor didn't make out or anything but we sat all curled up in the same chair, reclining, and he actually did fall asleep. Hehe.. while holding me and my hands and stuff. Totally sweet. One problem... he must have really really enjoyed himself because then we went back to my house and he was always tackling me and trying to get me to sit with him. Not at all that I didn't enjoy myself just as much as he did but I don't think it's right to do that in front of my mom! Actuallyshe wouldn't mind too much cause it's not like his hands were up my shirt of anything... not there at least, lol.

I liked the days when I'd come home from school and just do one post about my day that day and then do my homework, eat dinner and possibly go online again and post a second time, all in one day. If I didn't have anything else to do that is. Let's see... Thursday was a snow day! The one and only we'll have this year probably. A bunch of us went to Faye's for the day after some dad issues. That was fun. I think I need to point something out tho because it's still bugging me.  You know, it was me and Trevor and Tay and Faye and Anna and Russ and Amanda and John and Michelle and Allison. Well we watched a movie and that seems to always be make out time for almost everyone especially at Tiff's house. Taylor and Tiffany definately and Anna swears her and Russ weren't making out but they were showing lots of affection and sitting on each other. Amanda and John aren't going out yet and so they weren't making out ut Amanda was sitting on John's lap. Michelle and Allison didn't have their guys so thy weren't making out or sitting on anyone but still. Me and Trevor... we don't do the PDA stuff. We are reluctant to hold hands in public. Not even in front of those guys, at least my bestest best friends. I'm not saying I want to sit on him or do anything like that but... idk. And he even wanted to make out while everyone was either making out themselves or talking during the movie. I didn't want to. I don't have clue why not. It doens't make sense. I'm not afraid or weirded out by the fact of making out in the same room as my friends. And I'm not, you know, withholding anything... testing Trevor. I don't know why I didn't just go for it. I thought about it too much. Just like in Faking It. And I talked to Anna about it some and she listened and gave her opinions on things. It's not that we don't love each other or than we're embarassed to be with each other... I don't know. It's really bugging me though.   Anyways, he did come over last night and danced for Uncle Brett and ate dessert and played "The Totally Insane Card Game!" 'Twas fun. I hate my family and he knows that, but he also recognizes that I have to spend time with them. I think he's trying to lessen my load and give me something good to do while I'm spending time with my family. That's good. But he shouldn't sacrifice too much. UGH.  Wierd sensation: I burned the tip of my tongue on hot coffee earlier that day, yesterday. Do you know how weird it feels to kiss someone when you can't feel with the tip of your tongue!? Gah. Weirdest sensation.   Also Amanda's having a party tonight at her house. And then I think I'm having an Oscar party tomorrow at my house. Only problem is it's my dad's house and my dad's insane. So no one really wants to come. It's a lose-lose situation.

      Hi. Wow, Trevor was right. I haven't posted in a good long time.   V Day: Was totally awesome. Trevor took me to three movie. We watched only about 1 and a half. Ate dinner. And then went hottubbing. Fun stuff.   And that previous Thursday was progress report day at school. He went a failed like three classes and got grounded. Grrr... His dad says only one day a week out with me. I haven't seen him in four days. FOUR! Count them, 1-2-3-4! Four! That's the main reason why this week has sucked. And I probably won't get to see him until Saturday. Grrr Argh. hehe.  The second reason why this week sucks is my dad. He's being a real douche. Last night he wanted me to go to bed at friggin' eight o'clock. That's just gay. There's more to it but I'm not supposed to be on the computer and when my dad get home at like 5:30, I better not be on the computer.   I miss Trevor. *sob* And there's almost no way for us to see each other this week. Zero. No chance at all. That's really gay. And now I just found out that I may need to work at a ColorGaurd event on Saturday. Grrr Argh. I actually really love working those events but I'd so rather spend all the possible time with Trevor. This sucks. I'll try to post again today or tommorrow with some more updates on my life situation.  Also I check my email quite a lot now so anyone who wants to contact me can do so more easily that way than on AIM.   Thanks.

      BTW: Somehow I doubt anyone actually reads this other than Anna and Trevor but if anyone cares: here's my email address. Feel free to email me. keldan3@juno.com. On to posting:  Dang it.  I'm not particularly mad, in fact I'm really quite happy. It's Friday the 13th! Hooray! I'm pessimistic and counter-superstitious. It's the only way to go. But Trevor got bad grades in school and now he's grounded for like forever. He can't talk on the phone but for an hour between four and five. And he can only see me one day a week plus Saturdays. And of course tomorrow, Valentine's Day. That's gonna be awesome, I'm sure. I got him a Build-A-Bear. It's so cool. And I got a white T-shirt with it and jeans and a hat; and on the white t-shirt I'm gonna try to draw Dance Dance arrows. Try... that doesn't mean they'll come out good. I'm trying.  I'll be okay. I'll survive and I think our relationship is gonna survive too. I really really hope so.

      Wow. Just plain wow. Ok maybe I've just read too much romance novels, like one; but here's my description: What he does to me with his mouth is outrageous and I can't think of anyone better to do it with or a better time in our relationship. I'm gald we waited as long as we did and I'm glad it's him. He's totally awesome and I love him, and not just cause he's a good kisser. Tho it only improves. Yeah so I spent from about 3 til about midnight with him. And now I'm talking to him online. Yay! We rented movies: Freddy vs. Jason and Monty Python's The Life of Brian. We watched The Life of Brian, which was good and because his mom was there. And we watched most of Freddy vs. Jason because his mom was there. Dang, I was hoping not to have to see that one. It was scarey; blood and knives and slasher type stuff. Oh well, I survived. Then we went into his room and didn't watch Shrek. Fun. And then we went to his friend John's house and Dance Danced and played other video games. Saw his friend Patrick, who I'd been warned about. He has the absolute blue-est eyes I've ever seen. Bluer the Elijah Wood's or that guy from Cheaper by the Dozen. I was warned that he'd steal me away. Not so. They're very blue but for some reason just not at all... seducing, not like that at least. Then back to my house. We're so pathetic. He calculates how many red lights we can hit between his house and mine so that we can hit everyone and kiss when we stop. Sad... but cute. Yeah we go to my house, made out some more inside. Walked outside and made out some more. Is there such thing as being addicted to making out?  Just some observations: When we were on my bed kissing, we rolled over some and he ended up on top of me. Interesting, just an observation. It was really okay with me because it didn't feel sexual at the time, but looking back on it, it's so wrong. Oh well.  Also he'd said that he thought I enjoy french kissing more than he does. I still don't know quite what he meant by that but I did talk to him about it. He said it's just that when we're like hugging or just kissing he initiates the action. Whereas whne we're making out I do more, I "pull him in to me." I guess that's because I can't think much while we're making out. It's not that I want to think more, it's just that when we're making out I guess I stop thinking and just do. Which I guess is why we do more. Otherwise it's him making all the "how far do we go today" type decisions. Idk. I'm trying not to write myself in a circle. I don't know much. All I know is I'm blissfully happy for once and it's all because of Trevor. YAY! Man, I love him.

      Ok... ASO. Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Saturday night and my dad has season tickets and he didn't want to go so he offered the tickets to me and Trevor. "Sure!" So we got all dressed up and went. Dad drove and Tyler was with him and they went somewhere else during the show. But we... we held both hands and... petted and "explored" each other's hands. Actually he explored mine more than I explored his. Because I'd start to explore his hand and then he'd start to explore my other hand and I'd get caught up in what he was doing to me and forget about what I was doing to him. Idk. I was very very fun anyways. And for the first time that might we held hands in front of my dad, and he was fine. Idk. Very fun times though.

      OMG... chronologically updating starting for closest to now.  Okay, my dad has a hottub. And he offered to let me and Trevor use it one night. So today we went to see Master and Commander with Anna and he newest boyfriend Russ and her ex-boyfriend Patrick. Yeah, that was great. Not only were Anna and Russ making out with in hearing distance of all of us but they were making out when they've been going out for only two weeks. Me and Trevor... we're taking it slow and savoring every moment. It's very fun that way. Very fun. So yeah... if you ever want to take your relationship to the next level get in a hottub. It's so fun. So yeah... 2nd base is really awesome. I mean you go to the movies and you see people making out and you think it's rude and stuff. But until you've tried it you don't understand how awesomely fun it is. You never want to stop.  And the thing is that I'm the second girl he's kissed and he's my first. And we really don't have much to compare to. But seriously for one of little experience, he's absolutely awesome! Wow! I mean wow! You know it's very possible to just be a bad kisser. But no... he's just a plain awesome kisser. YAY! So.. I'll post another post to explain ASO.

      Not really here to talk on my blog too much. Just to rant. Just that like Monday I didn't call Trevor and he didn't call me, which was just fine because I knew he had things he was doing. His dad had just got onto him about not doing his yardwork in time, which he still didn't finish. Tuesday after he didn't call me and didn't call me, I called him only it was about ten thirty and his sister was on the phone or online and I couldn't get him. I miss him and I'm sad that I can't talk to him as much as I want to. But then there's the fact that niether of us really "talks" while we're talking on the phone. We sorta don't talk too much. We just... don't. I don't think it's because we don't have anything to talk about; we just don't chose to. I don't know. So today I called him. It was report card day, and not only did I jsut want to hear his voice and speak with him but I'd liked to know how his grades were because that pretty much dictates how often and how much time we get to spend together. His parent's rule, not mine. It sucks, but I can see why it's nessecary. So he failed three classes... crapola. Now that's less and less time that I get to spend with him. And the thing is whenever we do spend time together we go to his friend's house or somewhere to play video games. I'm glad he gets to see his friends and all but he goes to school with them, he doesn't go to school with me; he sees them everyday, he doesn't see me everyday. And I like our alone time, and it's not jsut because we make out while we're alone and not otherwise, it's just because.. because I haven't been around those people long enough to feel completely comfortable around them. There's things I can't say, things I don't feel comfortable saying. And they don't hang out with the same people I hang out with because they go to a different school, so they don't know all the inside jokes I know. I'll laugh at some random word and they'll think I'm insane because it's an inside joke. I realize that to gain acceptance with them I either have to tell them all our inside jokes (not happening) or spend more time with them to get in on some of their inside jokes and maybe form some new ones. And it's not jsut inside jokes. It's the video games and the people playing them. I'm not too much of a video game person. I'm just not. I don't know why. And that seems to be like all they do. And they're all guys, all of them and they talk about... guy stuff. Like looking at that hot girl who passed by and lifting wieghts and wrestling and stuff. I'm not a guy. That's how it works. I'm just not and I'm not at all saying they should censor their words around me, just... I don't know.   That was my rant. Bye-bye now. And just for the record I still love Trevor, always will. I love you Trevor since you're also reading this eventually.

      Hi yo. Jsut really decided I should post something about a life changing experience that happened to me over the weekend. I went to Disciple Now, a Christian (typically stereotyped as Baptist) retreat thing. And it was awesome. Not only was the fellowship and friends really awesome and the Casting Crowns concert Saturday night, too. During the Casting Crowns concert, they'd sing a few songs and then pray some or talk about the "help the children in Africa" fund, which was cool too, but you know... So anyway, they said a prayer and asked for anyone who wanted to be saved to please pray that prayer with them. I did it. I got saved. "Saved" is typically a Baptist term. But it simply means that you've accepted Jesus into your heart as your Lord and Savior and give yourself up wholy to God for his service as a Living Sacrifice. I did that. Wow. Mom kinda wierded out on me and asked "So are you like a Baptist now" which I kinda took offense to. Dad, I haven't told him, I don't know if I'm going to. I gave a testimony at the church service this morning in front of all the Disciple Now people and a bunch of other people who go regularly to the church, Trevor's, that I registered with. Scarey. I said I'd gotten saved and the whole crowd burst into applause and came up and hugged me and they prayed for me and... wow. All these people I've never seen before are congradulating me and crying, some seriously had tears in their eyes. Whoa. They prayed for me in the closing prayer for the whole church even. Whoa.  Trevor acted kinda acusatory. Asking "How many times have I asked you if you'd been saved?" I seriously couldn't think of any. He congradulated me and I know he was way happy and all for me.   I'm very glad I did it. I'm happy to have Jesus with me always and to be a part of his body. A living sacrifice.

      Another post today...  Very recently, as in this weekend, me and Trevor have, I think, taken making out to another level of passion. I saw him Friday and Saturday and I hoped to see him today I but couldn't.  Friday it was cold so we said our goodbyes sitting in his car. I seriously don't know what it is that's different or what either one of us did to make it that way but it's good. It was the first time I couldn't breathe. I took my breathe away. Intense. And passionate... just wow. So when we literally came up for air, I said, "You do that really really well." And in response, he kisses me again. Go figure. Not complaining at all, just commenting. Seriously tho, for someone who has no expierience with that, he's really quite awesome. We've both learned pretty fast.  We've seriously done something to take it to the next level. And it's so good. Whoa.  BTW: I  think he accidentally cut me. Wtih his snaggle tooth. It's funny. Like when you're that... close, that... pressed up against each other... it happened. It cut my lip and it bled a little bit but that's all and now it's almost non existant. Good stuff. I wanted Trevor to come over today and possibly go hottubing. But no... he's at John's. Dang him. Oh well. sok.  That's all for today. Three seperate posts. Dang.

      So yeah, on Thursday Dad pulled me aside and told me that basically the courts think that there's something bad going on at your mom's *snort* and we want to fix it. So someone told the courts. Not Anna. Not Trevor. Probably Tiffany. She's pissing me off recently. And she's feeling like she should make everything right with everyone before she leaves. So she or here mom probably told. Lovely.  So on Tuesday the Gaurdian-Ad-Litem came to talk to us. Fun stuff. He asked questions and I answered them pretty much truthfully yes or no. I sold her out. I told on her. Dad later warned me that they think that she may "retaliate." Not good. She sent me an mad email and signed it- Mom, the child beater with a telephone wire.  Lovely. Jsut totally lovely.

      *sigh* It's been a long weekend; good but exhausting. Let's  see there was supposed to be something at Russ's house this Friday but that didn't work out. So me and Trevor went to Dixieland, no wait... hang on. *runs upstairs to get her journal in which she writes daily*  Back. *flips through the journal* When was the last time I wrote? Holy crap! Feb 28, dang.   Ok: Amanda had a party on like Feb 29 and me and Trevor showed, to quote Anna, "our first real PDA." She say's it like it's a goal to achive. Like we should be here and we're here and we're working up... courage to get there. IDK. But yeah, we sat in a recliner together, and watched practically everyone else make out.   Nothing much happened Feb-29 til March 5th or 6th.  On some Friday we all went to the movies. No Trevor. But Patrick picked me up and took me home.  It was actually a more fun car ride than I'd expected. He's always been a close friend of mine but idk. I thought it'd be boring and it wasn't.  Then Saturday Trevor picked me up around noon and we went bowling and Dixielanding with his family for his cousin's birthday. 'Twas fun. Then we got to talking about the Holocaust and all the Holocaust and WWII books I read. Trevor didn't like that I read so much... Nazi propaganda books and whatnot. I can see his point bad it's not influencing me at all. It's just interesting material. But he didn't see it that way and we had an itellectual discussion about it. We brought his dad into the convorsation and he gave his view, basically siding with me. Trevor got all... pouty and moody and broody. Really quite scarey on someone who's almost always happy and smiling. I had to go really soon and so on the car ride home nobody talked. Really scarey. We jsut didn't talk, didn't look at each other, nothing. Until I said, "if you're not mad, why aren't you talking?" sorta angry like because I thought he was seriously really mad about it. Basically he was worried. This is a way over simplification: He thought that because of my... less than perfect family situation, that I'd be more suseptible to influence by the stuff I read. Brutality runs in my family. It's only natural. And I know he really cares and it's going to something that just going to have to be that way if we end up together. Agree to disagree thing.  But we drove home with both of us crying silent tears. Then once we got there, to Mom's, we did the ususal thing of going in, saying hi and i'm home and going back outside to say goodbye and kiss. But we'd both been crying and Tyler noticed it. He screamed up to Mom that something had happened and she called me upstairs. She asked me what was wrong and why I'd been crying and I said that I didn't want to talk about it right then. She told me that I had to come up and talk to her right away after I got back inside. She thought, and Tyler thought too, that me and Trevor had had a big fight and that we were going to break up. Not so.  So we went outside and talked. A lot. And cried. A lot. Mainly I cried. It was basically a "Harry and Cho" moment from Harry Potter. She cries and they kiss. That's not the main part but he did initiate a kiss, a good long kiss. And I'm glad. It was a happy break. But I told him lots of stuff that I hadn't told him before, details about my mom and what she does. Some weird things like hugs that I didn't really think mattered. We talked for about 45 mintues, I think. And then he definately had to go home. He called his parents and told them he'd be home in 20 mintues even tho it only takes 10 mintues to get home from my house. Since I had to go talk to my mom, he was afraid something was going to happen. He was going to stay there across the street for ten minutes, or until I signaled to him that all was okay. I went upstairs to talk to Mom. Nothing particularly happened. I just told her I couldn't tell her and that I wasn't truely mad at Trevor and he wasn't mad at me, I didn't think.  So that was fun. And it only sered to piss Mom off more.  On Sunday I went to Trevor's too, to escape the crying and stuff. Before I left I packed up my stuff to go back to Dad's and asked Mom to please take it with her when she took Tyler. She didn't. She refused. And I didn't get my stuff back until the lawyers called around and talked to her and they sent someone to get the stuff. I didn't have my school books for a day at school. That's really bad.  Will post another shortly.

      Wow. When did Blogger update it's homepage and all? It's cool. I like it a lot better. Now you can search for people. Not that I'm like trying to find anyone's blog in particular just wondering. And I've tried to tell people, Anna for one, Trevor for another, where to find my blog and I always get the address wrong. I'm pathetic, I know. but you know what: I'm not at the band concert and that very fact upgrades me from pathetic to a little sad. And I'm fairly happy. I guess. Except that Trevor told me last night that he really needed to talk to me about something serious and important today, and then he called me and said he was spending the day with Taylor. Taylor's his best friend and his girlfriend jsut broke up with him, the same girlfriend, Tiffany, who set me and Trevor up; which is a little unerving that they broke up. They're Tiffany and Taylor, Faye and Tay; they were going to be together forever; he proposed (sorta mockingly, sorta not). But anyway back to the story. We usually go to YoungLife together on Mondays, but today he wants to spend time with "the guys" and Taylor. Fair enough, if my best friend's boyfriend jsut broke up with her I'd blow jsut about anything off to spend time with them. But all the same he's leaving me to wonder what he wanted to talk to me about that was so important. He said he had to talk to me in person, not on the phone or on AIM, so it must be fairly important. But then again, it can't be like he's breaking up with me because he wouldn't let that go on for too long, any time at all for that matter. And plus he can't be like breaking up with me because there would have been some signs; anything... arguments... fights... disagreements... infidelity... none on my part, that is. Of course he keeps on saying that he has lesbian women sleeping over at his house all the time. Some of that makes me mad; I knwo he's kidding around and that it's not really true but sometimes it just gets in the way of talking on more serious issues. He also keeps saying that we need to fight more, that it keeps us together. Hatred, or momentary dislike makes people grow closer, you know? But he also sorta keeps trying to pick fights with me. Doing things that he knows piss me off just to get me angry. I don't know if it's like make-up sex or make-up making out... because it's not anything different than what we usually do. Idk. So I'm over-analyzing every situation again. But that's why I keep this blog and my own journal in writing: just so that I can rationalize my thoughts and sort them out. Yay!  In other news: We published LitMags today! Yay! We have every single last one of them done... done... done. Except selling them, which every single one of us is doing today, tomorrow and every day after that until we get every one of them sold. And next Monday we're having a pizza party to celebrate.  Let's see I will forcefully sell to... Brett Lorber, Billie Dawn... Scott Adams... Scottie... I think that's all. I'll sell around tho.  C-ya.

      Coolio. I like this post from any site thing. I'll be posting small tidbits every now and then.   As a random factiod: I ordered my first books online with my own debit card yesterday. 'Twas fun. I ordered three books for my AP US History summer reading project... which I should have already started on, *cough, cough,* and I also ordered a book that I've been wanting and wanting and wanting for a long time. I've seen it in Books-A-Million in hardcover for $30 or so. Way too much. Well, I found it online, paperback edition, used for $7.95. Boo-yah!   In other news: On Gaia, Taylor bought me and weretail and I don't want to sound stingy or impatient but the full moon's coming up and I really need it. He's out of town. Crapola. So I asked/begged Faye to get on his account and trade it to me. I hope she will. Please, Faye, please!

      So I failed my driving test.  I ran a freaking stop sign. Simply because I didn't know the area, 100 milles from my home, and I didn't see it because I wasn't looking close enough. Sucks... now I'm just sorta brooding. I'm kind of mad at myself.  We spent the afternoon looking for another place that would take us. You're suppossed to make an appointment but we know they'll take you if you beg enough and they'll take you more if you actually show up and say "take me, now!" One place, LaGrange, almost did. Almost doesn't count. But on the bright side if anyone I know ever needs to know where the DMV office is in Columbus, Americus, LaGrange or Newnan, I can tell them.  Now I'm waiting to wake up very early again tommorrow and do it again... everywhere.  You guys don't understand. I have to have a driver's license before school starts because otherwise I can't drive to school which means I have to go to McIntosh. Starr's Mill is my home... my friends, my family, everything I know. I've gone to Rising Starr in middle school and Starr's Mill all the years of high school. I tried really hard to apply for that "Special Attendance" scholarship and I got it. Now I deserve to get to go to Starr's Mill, gd it.

      So I'm stupid. So what. I just know got off the phone with Trevor and I decided to post again. I was reading Trevor's blog.. he's the only one who reads mine anymore so this is useless but here's the link anyway: www.mulletman584.blogspot.com So I was reading his blog... and he's talking all about how worried he is about me and that I'm hiding something. Well, I was, and I realized I'd forgotten to discuss that here, on my own blog. My mom... it was a really bad weekend, really qutie bad. Just about the worst it's ever gotten with me. Now Tyler's had worse. Tyler got hit for a long time before I ever got hit. Used to be that I only got hit when I got in the way of Tyler and Mom. The first time I ever got hit myself without anyone else's interference was that night that I was so scared that I did call Anna and she persueded me to call Trevor simply because he had a car and could drive and could get me out of there even for a night. I was really really scared. I mean I was so scared I ended up calling Trevor from my bedroom, in my closet with blankets piled around me. That's how scared I was. Since then I've gotten hit some but it's never been that bad. To tell you the truth I've gotten hit just as bad, I jsut didn't scare me near as bad. Not nearly as bad. I've called Anna a few times before hiding again. But I must not have been as scared sounding becasue Anna made me call Trevor that night; she's sugessted it since then but never insisted it so admantly. It's very sacrey. There have been times whne I just do not call anyone, Anna or Trevor or anyone because I don't want to anger her any more. There have been times when I probably should have called Trevor when Anna suggested it, but I didn't. Trevor was worried, I don't know how it showed through, but it did appearently. And he got worried. I guess I just broke down because of what had happened the weekend before that. It got really bad again. I know I should have called someone, anyone. But I didn't. I didn't call Anna; I didn't call Trevor and most of all I didn't call my dad. That's the one thing that most stops me from calling anyone: that they'll bring me to my dad's. I do not want him to know. He'll ask questions, he'll know things. He's manipulative and he'll try to get anything out of me. I know he'll get things out of me, some things that are true and some things that are stretched, like a lawyer leading a witness. That's not good. I know I should probably tell him something but I'm just no where near ready to do that yet. He sacres me. Mom scares me more though. I don't know what to do.  Crap... I was happy. Now I've depressed myself again. Crapola.

      Ok. So I'm talking to Trevor on the phone right now. I'm pretty happy with life right now. There was this question on the Extended Dicussion forum on Gaia about "Are you happy?" The choices were something like "Yes, I'm wonderful," "I'm okay," "Things could be better, things could be worse," "I'm alive and moving, what more do you want?," and "Life sucks." I chose the "things could be better, things could be worse" option. That's pretty much how I feel right now.  Tomorrow I'm going to get my license in Americus, Georgia. That's 2 and a half hours away and a good drive. Today I parallel parked perfectly, twice. And I drove to the airport, which is a big accomplishment. And I came back home a way that I didn't know, Riverdale Rd to Fayetteville Rd. to Fayetteville.  STOP LAUGHING AT ME, TREVOR!  So I hope I do well tomorrow for my driving test. Wish me luck...

      Yeah, so I broke up with Trevor. I'm not to happy, pleased, or excited about it. It's over and it's something I don't really want to spread around becasue I regret it. We're back together now after some deliberation on my part. All seems good, although it's never perfect.  Right now, I'm dead on my feet tired and high on caffine. I slept over with the Girl Scouts at Day Camp and didn't sleep much at all. Caffine is my only friend... ironically Anna's in France, or flying there as I type this. So it is kind of like "my best friend left me... my only friend is caffine" but I only said it figuratively. Thankfully she'll be able to check email and talk online. Fun stuff. And I'll get a postcard from her soon enough. She's of course visiting Juliette and her family. I probably will have to babysit Jake for a bit while she's gone. That's okay. I think they'll pay me but it's okay if they don't becasue they're like my family anyway. Paul Anka at the amphitheater tonight; it's 30 mintues from leaving time. I still have to take a shower and get dressed. Fun stuff. Mom's weekend, so I'm packed for that. Next week I'm probably going to watch Jake most days. Okie dokie? Okay.  That's funny. I danced a dance to a medley from Grease today; Better Shape Up, Greased Lighting, We'll Always Be Together. 'Twas fun. I gotta go take a shower and hopefully be ready in time. I know Ty won't be, ha!

      I'm happy right now. I just read Trevor's blog; he's way way too sweet. I really don't deserve like anything that he's telling me and nothing of what anyone says about me. I really have done nothing in my life worth praise. The only thing I've got to show for myself is my Girl Scouting accomplishments. I've been to Rochester, NY, Mexico and I've earned Silvere Award; I'm working on Gold. Not to mention all the various trainings I've taken and given; heck! I was training adults when I was 13 years old. That's pretty impressive, and I'll take praise for that but anything else is pretty much exaggeration. Seriously, I'm not pretty by any strech of the imagination and although I must be fairly nice in personality, I'm none too polite or curtious.

      Taht was my little... "State of the Union" letter to Trevor.   I feel like Anna's losing touch with reality again. She's not talking to me as much. She seems to be talking to Russ a good bit tho, that's good. But still there's a lot you can't tell your boyfriend. And there's always stuff that you must keep secret until you die. I'm not really jealous that she's talking to Russ, more worried. I liked her much better with Patrick. Patrick anyone can talk to, he has a way of making people feel comfortable so that they tell even their darkest secrets. I can even talk to him. And he's a good listener whereas Russ, not so much. He tries to turn everything to be funny. Like when I was waiting for forever for my dad to call so that I would know what happened during court. Russ turned it into something funny, about how it didn't relly matter because I'd spend so much time at Trevor's that all it was a bed. And that jsut really didn't help at all because that's part of what my mom said to make me feel guitly. Not good. So I'm worried that Anna's talking to much to Russ and I'm glad that Russ won't tell anything but he's still not the best one for counseling. I don't know maybe I;m just jealous that she's talking to him and not me but it still scares me because she used to always get mad at me for things, now she's mad at other people and they actually get mad back. I've never really truely been mad at Anna but once and we know why that was.

      I like how the first screen is called a "dashboard." Like The Dashboard Confessional. Good band.  So I'm back from Mexico, had agreat time. I'd tell more about it but it's very long and I keep a very detailed travel journal while I was there. Just to keep record. Most days I was too tired to write so I'd get up early in the morning and write about the previous day. It worked that way.  So since I know Trevor reads this blog I've always sort of kept that in the back of my mind, not to censor things, thoughts, just to omit certain details at times. So I've decided rather than write this totally like I don't know he's reading it when I know he is, I'm just going to change my writing style a bit. So to Trevor: You know that I haven't been writing much in my journal or here, the blog recently. I figured out why today. It's becasue I simply missed a few days writing and actually enjoyed it. I enjoyed not analyzing our realtionship and every move we make. I think that thinking has made me forget to feel... at least a little bit. Sure, I understand the passion and actually analyzing everything has made everything seem more passionate becasue I've relived each moment over and over again while writing about it. I think maybe it blinded me to where we were headed. I love you, you know that. And I always will love you. I can actually see myself growing up and still loving you, still being with you, maybe even marrying you and having a family someday. But that's a long long way off and if we don't slow down... God, I don't know what's going to happen, but we're going to be in some deep shit sooner or later. I know you've said that this is fast. I know it's fun, very enjoyable but that's the problem: It is so enjoyable that we're liable to end up going much further than we know we should. I trust you but you and I both know that you're only human and only male and you can lose control sometimes. And we both know that we can't count on me to stop it. I love you and I trust you within an inch of my life but I want to put more security there we that if you can't maintain control and I don't stop you; so that we won't go too far. Of course no one's ever 100% secure but we need some kind of limit, obviously. There's been many a time when we could have done way more than we did, thank God. I don't know what we can do to put limits, to give us some security but we need it. If you can think of anything... please tell me. Jsut know that I love you and I always will.

      I'm posting, really with nothing to say. Otherthan I like how the Streaking Guild's "E'rebody in the Club gettin' TiPsY XD!" shows up in the URL. Random, I know.   And today my Granny came over and she's still here: Cleaning. Even though she knows she doesn't need to clean. Our house is clean. And she has breathing problems that I can't spell here and she's using chemicals. She's folding clothes... my clothes... my underwear that's jsut going to get crumpled up into a drawer anyway. Who folds underwear? I can understand folding things like shirts and jeans and maybe even bundling socks together but not folding underwear. And the things is when she folds my underwear she always has to comment about it. "Kell?! Kell!? You really should throw this pair out. It's too thin here." or "Kell!?! Where are you? When you folded these clothes you didn't fold your underwear. Come back and do it right." So who folds underwear? Grannys fold underwear. I wonder if she fold her own underwear before she puts it in drawers at home... She probably does, as if anyone can see if your underwear has a wrinkle in it... *sigh*
