      ‘Origins of species by means of natural selection; or, the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life’, maybe a bit of a mouthful, but it is an important book for all those thinkers out there. At the age of 22, Charles Darwin went on a world tour with a few of his naturalist buddies (not to be confused with the now popular naturist buddies) to far off lands with coral reefs and dragons, where he met strange natives with bones in their noses and poison tipped arrows. They wandered around uncharted seas in a little boat for 5 years, picking up plant samples, finding insects with thousands of little legs and analyzing multicoloured birds before the hungry cabin boys could put them in the pot. Despite suffering badly from sea sickness and giving up the life of luxury that a rich Victorian is used to, Darwin soldiered on with his project, and returned to England quite the world savvy explorer. He spent the rest of his life recovering from some mysterious Amazonic STD, studying the bottles of pickled lizards and dried butterflies that he had collected on his travels. Darwin also had a few theories on life; how it was created, how it was evolving and perhaps how it might end. He shared his thoughts with friends over a pot roast pheasant one night, which thought he might have a strong case.  ‘You should write a book Charlie, you’re bloody clever so you are’.  So he wrote a book, that even he thought was good, so he wrote another, and another. The titles became longer and stranger, and the discussion deeper and darker with the summing up of a life’s work being published in his penultimate year entitled ‘The formation of vegetable mould, through the actions of worms, with observations on their habits’. I’m yet to get to that one, but it will certainly be next, just after I finish reading the National Enquirer that is next to my bed.  It is important to keep up with world affairs, and following the British dramas of the Hutton enquiry and the American Martha Stewart scandal, as well as keeping up with Jordan’s latest flame and the conspiracy theories of Janet Jackson’s right nipple clamp is nearly a full job time in itself. Reading the Enquirer at night helps with the American gossip, but isn’t much use when I want to know about John-two-jags-Prescott’s latest punch up or Wayne Rooney’s new love nest. So, when some friends came over from old blighty, they were instructed to bring over ‘Britain’s biggest selling newspaper’, the SUN. As the American audience may not know the Sun is famous for it’s outrageous headlines (such as KUNTZ! After master striker Stefan Kuntz scored the goal that put England out of the Euro ’96 championship) but also for the upstanding young ladies who get their baps out for the nation every morning on page 3.  ‘Well fit’, was Jonny’s comment on Zoe, 22, from London. And with 32-24-34 C measurements I could appreciate what he was talking about.  We were all at a bar in the right part of town later that day, at a poetry slam, and a hilarious middle aged woman got on to the stage and tickled us pink with a long winded story about a little blue box from Tiffany’s, ‘I don’t know what it is about her, she isn’t that fit, but there is something about her..’ Jonny, she is over 50, she has let herself go a bit too far, I’m not with you on this one. Jonny, Anna and Lou stayed for a week, and every nightspot we went to Jonny would find beauty, where sadly sometimes it was hard to find. Maybe those Chicagoan beer goggles are that bit stronger than the ones back home. ‘That girl looks like Joley Richardson, she is absolutely gorgeous, the fittest I have seen here so far’. Time for bed Jonny. When the English crew returned to their daily grind back home and I was left in Chicago with nothing more than a sack of carrots to keep me company, I started to think back to the funny northern boy and his funny northern lingo. What exactly is fitness all about? It used to be about how far you could run, or how many lengths you could swim, but now in England it is all about beauty. So I wonder what exactly Charles Darwin was thinking about when he wrote about his theory of the ’survival of the fittest’. Is it about beauty conquering all? When the pet cat has kittens, the runts of the litter are always the first to go. The kids always want to keep the prettiest kittens for themselves. And in an age where appearance has never been so important, over-worked plastic surgeons may agree that Darwin was right all along, straight teeth, and a good rack will be an important part of getting that promotion, and finding that dream man (insurance of survival). Beautiful people are often more confidant, more likely to succeed in life, as the cream always rises to the top.   But then there are those who believe that to survive, you must battle your way to the top of the pile, be it in one big punch, or a slow wearing down of the competition, body beautiful or ugly as sin. It is all about what is inside, and how much you have inside. Survival of the fittest is certainly relevant in the army where they push you to your limits physically, to train you to fight those merciless strangers in a far off land that have pissed of your President. Preparation is three quarters of the battle. If you are trained well, if you are fit, you are more likely to survive. But as strict as they train them in the army, you all should know that we have the famous General in charge of discipline in our kitchen, and making it through the day is as much of a challenge as it is making a career in cooking. I doubt if the General has even heard of Charles Darwin, yet he knows all about his theories on life. It is back to animal instincts when in the kitchen, everything must be harder, faster, cleaner and twice as beautiful as the time before, and anyone not keeping up with the pace will fall along the wayside. I have the cuts, bruises and burns to show for my days of fighting with hot pans, wrestling with sweaty chefs, sharp knives and mind warping verbal torture. That coupled with the stamina of working a minimum of 14 hours a day, and no wonder chefs are never the prettiest boys in town.  Kitchens draw a strange crowd, the general attitude in England for the new generation of chefs in an up-and-coming culinary destination is; ‘well, I was shit at everything else at school, and I like burgers, so I thought I would learn how to make them.’  Doomed I know.  So there are the dull’uns who will get to cook the grill one day if they are lucky, too stupid to realise they will be working life-threatening hours for the rest of their lives. Take Paul for example, he is from up state New York, says Cwoffee like every good New Yorker should, and never talks about the ladies, despite his rugged good looks and muscular physique. He looks a bit like Mr Potato-Head with the tired-chef clip-on eye-bags. I saw him chatting to a girl at ‘The Store’ one evening, but had to cycle on home before I was snowed in, and the next day over heard him telling big John about the ‘piece’o ass’ he got the night before. What? ‘Yeh, piece’o ass, you want me to spell it out?’ Naïve little English boy.  The 20 kids from the hood came in later that day, and there was a girl who seemed to be carrying some junk in her trunk, I turned to Paul, ‘piece’o ass?’ ‘Nope, that is some classic ghetto-booty boy. Britney Spears, now that is a piece’o ass..’  Being brought up on New York pizza does nothing for your chosen culinary career, and when the only thing you know what to do with a chicken is fry it after 5 years in the industry, you’d better get out if the game when time is still on your side. But for some the challenge of making through the day is sadistically addictive. I’d prefer to leave those sorts of sick power games for the slaves of this world.  Then there are those who genuinely enjoy cooking (you would be surprised), are interesting and interested, who unfortunately have the organisation skills of cuckoo on acid. The heart is in the right place, the passion is often there, and maybe even an understanding of food and cooking. But as soon as the tickets start coming in, and the pressure of feeding 70 people on 27 different tables is on, the chaos theory then starts kicking in, and a random mess comes out of logical progression. We have our representative from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to fill that void. Big John from the Northside learnt his trade from cookbooks and trial and error. He was voted Best New Chef in Florida before realising that there is more to learn in this big old world of fast food and fancy restaurants, so he went straight to the biggest name in American oat-cuisine, and took a job with Charlie and his angels. Unfortunately Big John has never had a chef to look up to and to work under before, and has never had the pressure of someone else’s discipline put upon him. Suddenly he is in a kitchen with people telling him what to do and how to do it, and as ‘the Best New Chef in Florida’, gets flustered and frustrated with his own lack of direction. It is a tough old life, kitchen life, especially with 20 odd egos flying around. The Big Chef must not only be a talented cook and organising wizard, but also a king mediator and chief ego capper. The General is the best person to bring cocky-two-shoes down a peg or two. A bit like the sin bin in rugby or hockey, a good 15-minute spell in the pot sink will bring any man crashing back to reality with a thud.  ‘I gonna ride your ass boy, I gonna break you..’ Gloria Gaynor got it right. I will survive.  So there are the dull’uns, and the ones who wouldn’t be able to work out how to get out of and open door. Both Paul and John get paid for their services, but there are then at least 5 people in the kitchen who work for nothing but the satisfaction of it. We get ‘chefs for the day’ who pay thousands of dollars (to charity apparently) to dress up in the starched whites, and self-consciously wear those famous tall hats. Usually enthusiastic dinner party cooks who just happen to have fallen into a high paid stock broking jobs which enables them to lavish their guests at home with fresh white truffles from Alba, and come to Charlie Trotters to pick up hints on cooking Kobe beef. They come in their mufti clothes, which around Chicago’s high-end stock broking fraternity is a strict dress code of an English hand tailored shirt, Prada jeans and those nasty tasselled slip-ons that went out of favour for English gentlemen in the late 1980’s. They help peel South African porcini mushrooms, sipping Fiji water from a Riedel glass, while the undernourished chef next to him tries to make polite conversation while deep in the shit, guzzling warm Chicagoan tap water out of a plastic beaker. Worlds apart, but which is more likely to survive if Saddam dropped a scud on Chicago tomorrow I wonder?  We have a chef who should be the hardest nut of them all. He grew up in a war zone, spent a few years in the army, and is the only one in the kitchen train to kill, yet young Roy, hailing from some obscure goat herding village outside Tel Aviv, is the tenderest, nervous wreck I have ever come across. On paper he is the perfect employee for a hard kitchen. Firstly he should be able to handle himself physically; with all that torture training they do in the army, never giving up, even under the heaviest of provocation. And Roy is also hyper-intelligent, speaking no less than 7 languages fluently, so theoretically he should be able to handle himself intellectually too. Unfortunately theory doesn’t always match reality. For all his world knowledge, and his expertise in killing a Palestinian 9 ways. He lacks the all-important trait in a successful chef, common sense. As an extern, here from culinary school for a 3 month unpaid stay, he unfortunately does all the jobs no one else wants to do, and when faced with a mountain of squabs on a Tuesday morning, you know you won’t see him for two days. He sets up camp down the back of the kitchen, and only moves from his spot for a 3.30pm feed, and a 5.00pm mop of the kitchen. I caught him wandering around the hotline during service having just finished his squab odyssey in some kind of dazed dream world that I think only factory workers get from doing the same thing for hours on end. He stumbled upon the grill station and watched Big John the meat man carving all sorts of delicious hunks of meat fresh off the wood fired grill. ‘Tell me John, is this bison you are cutting?’ ‘No Roy, this is a quail breast’. He came back two minutes later,  ‘John, tell me is this chicken you are cutting?’ ‘Roy, this is rabbit, chicken is quite different.’ ‘So John, tell me, this must be bison.’ John looked up in disbelief from his cutting board. For young Roy had just finished his marathon butchery lesson, pulling the legs and breasts from 200 flightless pigeons, carefully boning out the legs, de-skinning and trimming the little breasts. Did nothing sink in? ‘Roy, this is not bison, quail, chicken or rabbit. This is a squab breast, remember?’ Poor Roy probably can say squab in his seven languages, can crack codes, and knows all there is to know about the falafel, but give him a squab breast and a hunk of prairie grazing bison, and he is lost. Sadly some have it, and others can only dream of it.  Cooking is in the blood for a lucky few, and being Italian certainly helps with that. Brought up drinking cold pressed extra virgin olive oil, knowing the way pizza ought to be and cooking risotto the way mama used to make it is an education even 4 years at the Culinary Institute of America can’t teach you. Resident foccacia and mozzarella expert all the way from Milano, Giuseppe Tentori is the big sous chef, the number 2, in charge of everything from butchering one of his beloved rombo (AKA turbot for those of you who don’t know their Italian fish names) to being the chief tormentor on the hot line in the evening. Giuseppe has spent the last 6 years with Charlie Trotter and is living proof of survival of the fittest. He may look a little kitchen weary with his blood shot eyes and his ‘strawberry blonde’ beard, but there is still plenty of fire in his belly. I swear that his right ear must be deformed from having a phone pressed to it for 10 hours a day; such are the hardships of a busybody sous chef.  After a 14-hour day feeding 180 hungry Chicagoans, Big John the grill man, looks like he has only just survived stepping on a land mine, the boy is a mess. At least 2 nights a week his apron is melted from standing too close to the wood fired grill (good luck having children John, if your apron is that frazzled..) on the other hand Giuseppe looks no different than the minute he walked in the kitchen, there isn’t a hair out of place, not a mark on his apron, despite getting stuck in butchering fish and painting plates with orange, purple and black sauces. Having spent the last 10 years in this land of milk and honey, you would assume that language wouldn’t be a problem anymore, but when an Italian with an accent as heavy as Giuseppe’s, is screaming at you in the height of a busy Saturday night, he does tend to repeat himself quite often,  ‘Hiillooow? Miit, wera is thea miit?’  Unfortunately everyone in the kitchen has anglophile names too, which is a little too much for our little Italian buddy. If everyone had names like Paulo, Francesco and Giorgio life would be so much easier, because Joseppy might be able to remember them. But because he has an aversion to remembering non-Italian names he calls everyone in the kitchen Johnny, or Jackson, which means in the height of a busy Saturday night, he does tend to repeat himself quite often.. ‘Hiillooow? Johnny, miit, wera is thea miit?’ I have been promoted to the name of crack-boy, which at least narrows it down, as there is a crack-pipe in the kitchen too, and the Maestro from Milano is slowly coming round to the idea that my parents had of calling me Jesse. But one step at a time. He loves his kids, even if there is hatred in his bloodshot eye at 7.26 when the meat he has been handed is a bit overcooked. All is fair in love and war, and at the end of service he has been known to smile, well at least twice since I have been here anyway.  But if we are talking about survival, there is no better survivor than the Big Chef, Chef de Cuisine, Chef Matthias. Stick him on a desert island with nothing but a corkscrew and a fig leaf, and he will still make it happen. Chef Matt has been at the restaurant for nearing on 9 years and I remember the first day I arrived, he walked up to me with his overly tight-fitting toque pulled over his brow like and army officer, and came close up to me and stared very deeply, deep into my soul with contact lenses floating around these huge hazel eyes,  ‘ARE YOU PSYCHED?’ To be honest I had never been psyched before, coming from a country that is about as enthusiastic about life as a wet Tuesday in March. In England we are real about life, honest about life, and if we are honest, life is difficult and grim sometimes. People complain about all those grumpy people they meet on the tube in London. You try living there with a permanent smile on your face, especially when sitting on a tube, which at any moment could derail; such are the problems on anything public in England. Americans on the other hand are the most enthusiastic people I have ever met, pity little of it is real, ‘hi, how are you today? Great! Great!’ is a long winded way of saying hello in this country, to ask some one how they really are you must repeat the question, ‘no, how ARE you today?’ and just to throw people, I sometimes answer with a negative answer, because as we all should know life doesn’t always smell of roses, ‘I feel like shit today thanks, a splitting headache and I have the most awful diahorrea.’ Watch the face drop, and the fear appear in the eyes. The fear of reality. But Chef Matthias, although having grown up in some safe suburb of Chicago, and being partial to the occasional high-five is quite real about life. He is the most European American I have met. He is interested in organic food, small producers of speciality goods, such as the mop haired hippy who comes to the restaurant every week to deliver real cream, eggs and the latest unlucky animal around the farm. He is fascinated by the contrasts of European and Japanese discipline and works the best from both worlds. He also makes things happen, he is feverishly passionate about what he does, he is sensitive and delicate, but is also an aggressive hustler when he needs to be. I think his philosophy on life is all about application and adaptation, the true goals of survival. That coupled with the fact that he has the biggest and sharpest knife I have ever held, a two-foot tuna razor, and if anyone wanted to challenge him for the throne of ‘the fittest’, he’d cut you into the finest sashimi this side of the Pacific.  To survive in this little world of ours, we must fight to get to the top of the pile. If my poor mother heard this she would shudder with disgust,  ‘How did I bring you up thinking like this darling? Life is all about living, loving and being.’ But maybe I am just talking about my little competitive world of constant limit pushing in the pursuit of excellence. We all have our goals in life, I wonder what yours are?  Jesse Dunford Wood  12 March 2004
