       Why is it that everything has to have a "reason" and be rationalized to death?? What is with this mystical "reason" anyway? NOTHING that I do really has a "reason"~ with the exception of my daughter... Her reason was to straighten me out. But, I mean.... seriously, let's stop trying to explain stuff.... Let's right this instant stop looking for these elusive "reasons" and start making our own. Be honest, are we truly ever going to find what we're looking for?? Does anyone even KNOW what they're really looking for?!?! WHO'S WITH ME?!?!? Let's start being proactive and aggressive and let's just take charge of our destinies a bit. If there's something you don't like, then CHANGE IT!! I know I sound all Television guru-ish, but seriously... I hear so much whining all the time from EVERYONE I know. I just want to slap them and say, "Look... do something for yourself!! Don't trust that some all-seeing power is just going to make things go poof for you." Because, really, does anyone really know?!?!     Seriously, though, if anyone knows Morphius could they tell him that I am in need of one of those pills?!?! :)

       Just a quick post before I leave today.... it's crappy and a bit cold here in NY, lovely August weather.  So, a bit about me... I'm 26, go to school for Dental Lab Technology, have a 4 year old daughter, fancy myself a movie snob, but am a fangirl at heart..... give me really any guy from the Lord of the Rings and I go weak in the knees... although, if forced to choose, Elijah Wood is my favorite because he seems really smart and kinda dorky, ya know?!?!  Orlando Bloom is just too PRETTY and too... I dunno, I just don't trust a guy who's a techno-phobe!!!  Anyways, I also love Speed Racer cartoons (the old-school ones), Pinky and The Brain, all movies~ especially Monty Pythons.... classic!!~ music.... some favorites are Stone Roses, Beastie BOys, The Beatles, Led Zepplin, Elvis, Blondie, The Clash (my daughter was named after a Clash song), Bob Marley.  Right now, I've started reading the book Cheet.... I've just finished About a Boy (much better than the movie, but isn't that how it always is?!?!).  So, I'm off into the world today... Will post later!!
