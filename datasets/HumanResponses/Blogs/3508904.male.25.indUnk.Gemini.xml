      So here goes, my first blogging experience. I guess I am starting this since it is much easier than email everyone updates constantly.    Austin truly is a unique town.  There is defiantly a strong contrast between it and Waco.  There are several stark contrasts.   As you are well aware if you know me at all one of my favorite activities is going to Common Grounds to study, people watch, and spend time with friends.  I knew replacing CG’s for the summer would be an impossible task, especially since part of the great appeal of CG’s is all of the friendships that I have there.  But,  I have already found a few good coffee shops here: one right across the street from where I am staying the first couple of weeks—Flight Path,  and another a couple miles away—Spider House.  While these coffee shops don’t have my friends, yet at least, they do have one thing that Waco’s coffee shops lack that makes them almost as good if not at times better—they all serve beer.   But the differences do not stop at the local coffee shop.  The very make up of the average person here is quite different than that of Waco.  In Waco, I have the appearance of a hippie communist freak; meanwhile, in Austin I have the appearance of a yuppie.   Ok, not quite but I while defiantly stood out in Waco, I look rather kosher for this town.  Moreover I must admit that I am a guy and can’t help from notice that bras are much less popular here than in Waco.  But it doesn’t stop there, oh no it doesn’t.  Friday night, a couple friends and I were going to 6th street to see Okerville River and Shearwater play at the Parish.  Both en route to and coming out of the club we noticed a woman who was not only lacking a bra, but her shirt as well—she was walking around completely topless, we even saw a cop ride right by her, look and do nothing.  This really is a different town.   But, I am really loving the diversity of culture that this town offers.  Mosaic’s (the church I am working at) meets on Sunday nights leaving my mornings free to either sleep in or go elsewhere.  This past Sunday morning I went to Liquid, a postmodern styled Chinese church.  It was really awesome, my friend and I were totally made welcome there.  We even went to lunch with several people from the church including the pastor.  We got to talk theology, missiology, and the possibility of forming some partnerships.  It a something neat to be in a service where I am in the overwhelming minority.    Mosaic’s service went fairly well despite one of the most hectic Sunday afternoons I’ve had in a while.  The church normally meets on the 4th floor of FBC Austin, but that room doesn’t have any AC so we will be spending the summer in the basement in the fellowship hall.  But, the room presents a bit of a problem, it is too sterile and too big.   So, one of my tasks this past week was to  construct a frame to hold up black fabric to break the room up.  Thanks to a friends help and a random visitor who arrived an hour and a half before the service we finished constructing this curtain a whole 20 minutes before the service was to begin.    Anyways, all is well for now.  I am just still finding myself frustrated waiting for that phone call telling me to come to Dallas to become an Uncle.  Kate Elizabeth Smith, was due this past Tuesday, and still no word! She is soooo tardy.

      So, the past couple weeks I haven’t been quite as good at blogging as I was when I first started.  I think when I started I was so excited about my niece I wanted to tell everyone, and I also think I was a little lonelier here in Austin at that point.  But slowly I am making good friends down here.   It is hard to believe that we have already reached the end of June.  I am excited about going home this weekend for Andy and Jen’s wedding.  As I have told everyone it will be really strange but fun to have everyone in town.   All my worlds will be colliding this weekend—I am just hoping than none of the atoms get smashed blowing everything to smithereens.  Friends that I grew up with from middle school, high school and youth group will be there, as well as roommates and good friends from college, and on top of that a whole bunch of seminary friends will all be there.  And oh yeah, my parents also live there and my aunt and uncle will be in town, so pretty much Amarillo this weekend will be the nexus of my universe.  Who knows it may turn into a black hole and suck Chris in from Carolina and David Wiley in from Scotland.  There is only one bad thing that I realized last night about this weekend. I usually look forward to going to my home church, it is far from the perfect church but I still like it.  But I will be there now on the 4th of July,  and one of my biggest peeves is patriotism in worship services. No doubt this service will be full of such stuff, so I don’t know if I will even want to go then.   So last night I preached at Mosaic, I talked about suffering and death, I used the first chapter of Philippians.  I thought it went fairly well and people told me I did really awesome: so in actuality it would probably fall into the category of good.  Although I was given one really high compliment by Emily Vanderslice, or so Don V told me, that my style etc. reminded her of Jeff Raines—the Assoc. Pastor in Amarillo, someone whom I have an awesome respect for.  It really is one of the highest compliments I have received in long time.    I forgot to write in my blog last week that I had the privilege of planning a commissioning service for Eric, one of the guys at Mosaic who is taking a team to India for the next 6 weeks.  Not only was it an honor to do so, but it was really neat thinking about it, preparing it and doing, not only for Eric and his teams sake but also I couldn’t help but think about Jen, Julie, Lizzie,  Tim, Dr. Stroope, and all my other Truett friends who were in India at the time.

      You know how sometimes everything is just going along on an even keel—nothing awful nor anything great happening at the moment.  Which really means things are quite well, because after all if things aren’t bad then they must be good, right?  Then comes the wrench and it wreaks havoc on everything.  Well the wrench came on Friday, the day after my birthday no less. L  I had gone over to big Phil’s to hangout with a few friends and watch a movie.  Afterwards, I was just about to leave grabbed my stuff, told my friends I would see them tomorrow and walked out the door.  They were surprised by my reentry to the room just a few minutes later.  My car had been broken into—for the third time and it isn’t a charm.  Stolen: my wallet—with all of my ID’s, credit cards, and insurance cards--, my iPod (something which is one of my prized possessions), and my spare tire.  They took my freakin spare tire, it isn’t even a full size one, but the little donut you can’t drive more than 50 miles on, why?  Is there some secret black market in Mexico or something for donut tires? Anyways, I got all the credit cards cancelled before they made any charges.  Now, I just have to go about rebuilding my identity: drivers license, SS card, ATM card, credit card, etc. . .  Each of these will of course cost a little bit each adding up to a lot. But, in the end it is still just stuff, but it is really a big pain in the ass to get it taken care of.      Oh, and thanks to Cisco and Kimberly for getting me my passport the only proof of my existence that I have any more, legally speaking, I don’t often doubt the reality of my own existence, but that is another discussion entirely.

      Ok, most Americans are likely wholly unaware of the great sporting event that has just begun across the pond—no I am not talking about Wimbledon or the Tour de France, but I am talking about the Euro Cup, a soccer event which occurs only every fourth year.  All the European nations get put in pools and have a big tournament.  Today Don, one of pastors of mosaic, and I were going to go to a bar and watch the Germany v. Netherlands game.  We called the bar to be sure they were airing it, and sure enough they were.  So we set out to walk to the bar—a little over a mile from the church.  We get to the bar and walk in and there is a 20 dollar cover charge.  Yes, that is right you read that correctly twenty dollars to watch a soccer game on television.  Unbelievable.  This past week was rather uneventful.  I have moved down to shelton’s—way on the south side of town, but a very nice house.   The house is on border of a new neighborhood and the greenbelt—an area that is city park to recharge the local aquifer so it will never be built on.  It is nice to look out the window and see the hill country.    This past week also went to a couple of really good concerts.  Some friends came down to see Pedro the Lion play at Emo’s on Thursday evening.  And on Tuesday night The Sad Accordions, the worship band at mosaic.  Both shows were awesome.  There is something really cool about seeing authentic Christians play good music at bars, while having a cold frothy beverage.  PS.  I almost forgot to include that I am rather upset at myself this week.  I came very close to going to FBC Austin on Sunday morning, but I backed out and decided to sleep instead. When we got to the church to setup for Mosaic for the evening we ran in to Roger the pastor of FBC.  He told us who we just missed—the official canter for the Dalai Lama—apparently he is friends with a member of the church and came to town doing some human rights stuff.  It would have been awesome to meet him.

      On my trek to dallas (ok it isn’t really far enough to be a trek, but I broke it up to see friends along the way, so it defiantly was a journey) Kate born I was struck by several juxtapositions.  On Thursday morning going through Hillsboro I drove past where I-35 southbound was closed, because a trucker had been killed, it appeared as though the truck in-front of him ahead slowed down and he couldn’t stop in time and rear ended him, there was nothing left of the truckers cab, it had been smashed to oblivion.  Here I was going to see a new life while next to me a life had ended—the church must be big enough to cry and celebrate at the same time.    The night before on my way to Waco for a night I was mesmerized by the show that laid ahead of me throughout the drive.  Just after I got north of Round Rock it began to show itself.  A marvelous lightning storm.  At first I would only see a strike every minute or so, eventually it would rise to nearly every second.  Each strike illuminated and silhouetted the storm heads from a different angle making each more unique than a snowflake.  This lightshow was far and away better than anything ever on the side of Stone Mountain.  I was in absolute awe of the beauty of this show.  That was from a distance, when I got into Waco, it began to change.  As soon as I passed the city limit sign a lightning strike in front of extended the yellow reflectors on the left side of the road infinitely skyward.  Then after running by the house I headed to Common grounds to meet some friends.  As I passed through downtown it hit—high winds shook all the signs and the same lightning storm, which had been so beautiful from a distance I was now in the midst of. And it was loud and destructive—knocking out the power for a while in downtown.  When I got to CG’s many of the people there were worried about the possibility of a tornado, fortunately there was none, but only some heavy straight-line winds.    The next day I thought about that storm and how it was so beautiful from far away but quite scary from within.  Then I thought that is much like God.  God is beautiful and truly amazing from a distance, but if we allow ourselves to get to close—utterly destructive.  God when we come too close God destroys everything that we have known about truth and reality and leaves as something new. Isaiah 6.

      Well, What a week this has been.  While my first week in Austin was relatively laid back—a few big projects to do, but overall laid back; the second week was almost the exact opposite.  Crazy, frustrating, tiring, and exciting.  Early in the week it was hot and my car broke, as I already posted, but I eventually got it fixed and I managed to work my way up to Dallas on Thursday morning around 10 to wait with my family and spent the morning and early afternoon waiting and waiting and waiting . . .actually we didn’t have to wait as long as some have had to, but when you are waiting with baited breath each minute can seem like an eternity.  But eventually, a little after five my brother emerged to the waiting room to tell My parents, Shelby’s Mom and brother, and myself that Kate Elizabeth had been born at 4:43 all 6 pounds and 13 ounces o and 20 inches of her.  She is so beautiful and sweet, not that I am biased at all but I think she is gonna be a genius or the next Serena Williams or something, at only 18 hours she was already lifting her head and turning it on her own. She takes after me and her other uncle, she has ouw fingers, they are super long.      then I drove back to Austin late on Friday night, then got up bright and early on Saturday morning and spent all day on a decostruction project with habitat for humanity. I probably used a skill saw on over a hundred boards and removed a few hundred nails from boards-so that the boards could be recycled and sold to help with the next habitat build.  I was very tired by the end of the day.   In the post below this there is a link to a pic of Kate.  (I am still learning this bloging thing, and how to embed pictures in one).

      Today has been one of those days when it is really hard to tell if it was a good day or not.    Midmorning came, and with it so did staff meeting, but we don’t meet like a typical church staff, today I just had to walk across the street to Flight Path, grab a cup a joe and then we started.  Right as we were about to leave my phone rang, I looked at the name and there it was “Harold” (my brother) the name I had been hoping to have call me for the past 3 weeks.   He said, ‘well first off, we’re not having the baby now, but we wanted to let you know that we are having it induced on Thursday.’  A friend and I were talking the other day about that waiting for a baby is kind of like anticipating a sunrise when you live in northern Alaska, you have been waiting for it for months, but don’t know for sure if you will actually get to see the sun today.  Well, now I finally know when I will get to see the sun, months even years of waiting finally have an ending date set.  J  Then, I was driving around this afternoon and Ben, one of the guys in the band at Mosaic, called and asked if I wanted to go with him to Zen for lunch.  Zen, is aptly named as it a fast-food Japanese place here, complete with sushi.  Ben works at this Zen, but it doesn’t open until tomorrow, today was one of those VIP/family and friends of workers day.  Which meant we could have all we wanted and it was all free. J    Then I went to Target to begin working on some projects for the church, they didn’t have what I needed so I was going to head to Home Depot.  I got in my car and started it. SCREEEEEEAAAAAACH.  God awful sound so I killed the engine, popped the hood and saw that my belt-the only belt in Jeep Cherokees had busted.  So I called AAA, had the car towed to a mechanic, and walked home from there, about a mile and a half.  Now that isn’t too far.  But when it is hot like it was today it far very far.  The heat index was around 108—that is the kind of heat, that when you ring out the sweat from your clothes when you get home you squeeze out your own body mass in sweat.  L  Then I spent the rest of the afternoon cooling down and reading. J   I’ll have to wait till tomorrow to find out how bad the news is on my jeep, but I must say overall it has been a dang good day.

      Suck, well it now appears the michael moore will not be there apparetnly he recieved several death threats etc.  not sure if i am going to be there or not now.   since i know how often i myself pick up the paper in waco, it is often easy to miss something going on in town, particularly when it happens on short notice.  today i was doing my usual looking at news on news.google.com ( a good news site that puts several links to the same story from different news bureaus) and couldn't help but notice the headline 'michael moore invites bush to crawford screening.'  i looked at this and tomorrow night (wed. night) there will be a special screening of Fahrenheit 9-11 in the football stadium parking lot in crawford, tx.  moreover, michael moore himself will be there to talk about the movie and have a Q/A session.  whether you agree with him or not this is a pretty neat opportunity. they are asking for $8 donation, it will be kind of old school drive in style--meaning the show will start at dusk.  I am hopefully going to be able to be there, maybe you can too, and who knows maybe we will even get a state visit (yeah, right).    more details/ directions @: http://www.crawfordpeacehouse.org/

      revision after *****  ok, in light of the imminent democratic national convention,  and in honor of our president’s annual vacation to my beloved central texas city, i am going to make a brief foray into the realm of politics.  i get rally frustrated some times because we claim to be living in a democratic and free society—free to choose our own destiny.  but what choice do we really have?  a multi-millionaire war mongrel or a multi-millionaire pro-choicer? it seems that despite our free elections there really is little choice, votes are all bought and the rich get richer while the poor get f#%ked.  if you know me then you likely know that I am planning on voting for kerry; bush’s passion for killing people and his ‘well we can leave the poor kids behind’ policy based on the idea of uncompassionate greed leave me with a desire to see almost anyone else in office (not quite but close to it).     but alas, i think i have finally done what i would have thought was impossible a few weeks ago.  i have finally come up with a truly sound reason to vote for bush, which just might turn my vote.  (not that my vote really matters since i am registered in texas.)  here it is:  if bush loses he will be in crawford=waco all the freaking time.  gone will be the days where we would have two weeks vacation between his ‘working vacations’-our hell of diverted traffic and constant helicopter noise.  so there you have it, a sound reason to vote for bush.  ****************** ok, i have just been informed that there is a second and possibly even more valid reason to vote for bush's reelection.  the yankees have not won a world series while a republican is in the white house since the '60s.

         Dr, Conyers professor, writer, and friend passed away yesterday morning.  His death did not come out of the blue, but rather as has happened more than once in his tenure (ironically he being a founding faculty member had just completed ten years—‘tenure’ of teaching young theologians) at Truett found himself imminently close to death much of this past year.  Not that you would know such from any conversation with him in the past year, despite his visibly distraught state, he was always jovial and curious as to my own well being.  Perhaps it is because we have heard tales of Ruth Ann Foster and other faculty visiting him in past years on his deathbed that brought shook to me yesterday when I heard of his demise. He came to class in the fall, with an altered schedule, and apologized to us for having to take a call from his doctor, his lung had collapsed earlier in the day, but before going into the hospital he insisted on teaching us. He has been able to recover before and despite the fact that the doctors had given up treatment of the disease, surely God had not given up on healing our beloved professor.  And if God had not given up, then I should not give up hope either.  I am even signed up for one of his classes in the fall, and while I wasn’t expecting him to be there every day I was certainly holding on to the hope that he would make a few appearances to impart some of his profound wisdom, all be it in his convoluted way.  A few weeks ago I preached on death and suffering, from the first chapter of Philippians, Paul writing from prison says that he looks forward to death and would even choose that over life to go and be with Christ.  I concluded that sermon with the closing page from C.S. Lewis’s epic, The Chronicles of Narnia, the last page of the last book in that series—The Last Battle reads:   “Then Aslan turned to them and said: 'You do not look as happy as I mean you to be.' Lucy said, 'We’re so afraid of being sent away, Aslan. And you have sent us back into our own world so often.'  	'No fear of that,” said Aslan. “Have you not guessed?'  Their hearts leapt, and a wild hope rose within them.  	'There was a real railway accident,' said Aslan softly.  'Your father and mother and all of you are—as you call it in the Shadowlands—dead.  The term is over: the holidays have begun.  The dream is ended: this is the morning.' And as he spoke, he no longer liked like a lion to them; but the things that began to happen after that were so great and beautiful that I cannot write them.  And so for us this is the end of all the stories, and we can most truly say that they all lived happily ever after.  But for them it was only the beginning of the real story.  All their life in this world and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover and the title page: now at last we are beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read: which goes on for ever: in which every chapter is better than the one before.”   One of my favorite memories of Dr. Conyers came from my semester in his Intro to Theology class, one of his patent jokes in that class was, “So years from now when you are in the coffee shop reading and chatting and someone asks you what ______( novationism, nominalism, etc) is you can tell them  . . .” Several of my friends had gotten together one night at Common Grounds to prepare for one of his midterms, and we had some confusion in our notes, so we decided to call him, I called and told him, “Dr. Conyers we are at the coffee shop discussing  . . . and needed your help.” He just rolled into laughter, and then gave us a good deal of help.    Dr. Conyers you have departed us, you have awoken from this dream that we call life at the feet of the Lord, fully enlightened and fully restored to worship our Lord in resurrected perfection.  Years from now when I am chatting at coffee shops I will be talking about you and remembering you fondly.

      So wow, it has been a little while.  Sorry for that—the trip to Amarillo, while good was a bit of a whirlwind.  Everything went pretty well: got to see my family and friends young and old alike.  We kicked my parents out of the house and had the bachelors party there including a good little bit of torture for Andy.  Anyways that is over and done with.    I skipped church on Sunday.  I normally look forward to going to church back home at least a little bit.  But this time was different—I had seen the order of worship in the room where the groom’s side hung out.  This time the worship included the pledge of allegiance and the national anthem as well as a testimonial time for veterans.  If you know me at all you are likely to know that patriotism in the religious sphere of life is one of my biggest pet peeves.  I don’t know if anything gets my blood boiling more than seeing a cross draped in an American flag.   The whole phrase ‘God bless America’ also causes me to cringe because it is so often said not only out of a petition of God’s favor to show upon us, but also out of the belief the we are God’s chosen instrument to enact the divine will upon the world.  If I were to go to church that Sunday I would likely try and rip the chair out of the balcony and throw it at the stage.  Ok not really, but I would defiantly be pissy as result for a good while.  We in the American church are guilty of committing idolatry with the American flag.  After some thought and venting though I have come around a little bit and must admit that I am thankful for living in a country where the flag stands for having the right to rebel against it.

      The other day I had a couple of meetings with a pastor here in Austin.  It was a very refreshing meeting.  The agenda of the meeting was to be about discussing the preparation and carrying out of funerals, weddings, and baptisms.  But like any good relationship driven meeting (rather than one which is simply concerned with checking things off a to-do list) much more was covered.  We talked about schools and common friends.  Talked openly about the things that irk me to no end as he did as well.  He talked about going to school with my professors and affirmed that even as a lowly undergrad Hulitt Gloer could even then out preach anybody in Waco.  We talked about those professors whom both teach and inspire us and cussed about the administrators we loathe.  This meeting was very refreshing to me—to spend time with a pastor of a major church in Austin who was willing to be so real.  Not that are other pastors are holograms or anything like that but often times they might as well be since the worries over how they will be perceived create ministers whose only concern is for image rather than substance.    But it was not simply a couple of bleeps that made this meeting enjoyable, but also he imparted a great deal of wisdom.  In particular in talking about marriage.  Nothing earth shattering new that he said but just a reminder of the nature of a covenant.  The pastor got onto one of my soapboxes and talked about the marriage not the wedding ceremony being what is important.  In doing so he briefly mentioned the fact that marriage is to be a covenant not a contract.  In a contract of one party does not hold up to their end of the bargain then the contract becomes null and void.  However, with a covenant it does not matter what one does it does not dissolve.  No matter how many times Israel screwed up (and boy was it ever a lot) they were still God’s people inescapable of his love.  Today we hear many evangelicals arguing for ‘marriage protection acts.’  Why don’t we start by truly protecting marriage inn the church.  That would mean divorce regardless of how bad a marriage is getting would be almost nonextant (abuse and adultery being the exceptions).  It would mean that rather than creating a culture where good little Christians go to college and find their ‘soul mate’ to get married within a year of graduation would die out.  It would mean we openly affirm and put people in leadership who are single and have been rather than simply doing something they were supposed to end in divorce.  It would also mean though that we would love and cherish the people whose marriages are in shambles but they have not yet given up on it.    It means that if I get married no matter what my wife would do she would still be my wife whom I must love.  After all it is a covenant and to date Christ hasn’t stopped loving me.

      Despite the fact that my iPod went bye-bye at the hands of some thieves (those bastards ;) ) I still use iTunes a good deal on my computer, it is an awesome program for being your computers jukebox.  I love the way that it keeps my music organized automatically.  The program is free and works on PC's as well as Macs.  Occasionally I will log on to the iTunes store website to see what is new and available even though I have no cash.  Today I found two things one which was exciting and the other utterly depressing.    First the good: on the site they have the majority of the speeches from the Democratic National Convention available as free downloads-FREE, I really like that (see note above about cash assets).  Certainly all of the speeches are a bit pompous as is understandable in a convention setting, but some of them are really good, others (ie Jimmy Carter) are ones i really want to hear.  I only hope that they will do likewise with the RNC (I really do hope that).  I highly recomend Barack Obama's speech.  now for the depressing note, I clicked on the audio books link within the speeches section, perhaps it appealed to me after reading Myles's blog (http://godinthedetails.blogspot.com/) but i think i really did so to see if there were any other freebies.  I think audio books can be good for long drives etc, but i am a particular fan of radio shows they have such as This American Life and Prairie Home Companion.  Anyways, that is when I saw it: the "audio book version of the novelization of the film Spiderman 2"   And there you have it.
