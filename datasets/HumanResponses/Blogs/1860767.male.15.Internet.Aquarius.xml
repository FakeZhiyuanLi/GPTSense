      Hello and welcome to theblackbunnyofhell.co.uk  The site is currently a total mess but it should be sorted out eventually.  That's all I'm going to say for the moment because I'll be able to say more than this when the site is running properly.  ~ TBBOH

       Bill Gates died and went to heaven.  On arrival, he had to wait in the reception area. This was the size of Queensland, with literally millions of people milling about, living in tents with nothing to do all day. Food and water were being distributed from the backs of trucks; staffers with clipboards battled their way through the crowds. Booze and drugs were being passed around, fights were commonplace. Sanitation conditions were appaling, the whole thing looked like Woodstock gone metastic.  Bill lived in a tent for three weeks until, finally, a staffer approached him - a young man in his late teens with acne scars wearing a blue T - shirt with TEAM PETER written on it.  "Hello." said the staffer in a bored, bereaucratic sounding voice. "My name is Gabriel and I'll be your induction co - ordinator."  Bill started to ask a question but Gabriel interrupted him. "No, I'm not the Archangel Gabriel, I'm just a guy from Melbourne named Gabriel. I died in a car crash at the age of 17. Now give me your name, last name first, unless your Chinese, in which case it's first name first."  "Gates, Bill"  Gabriel checked his clipboard.  "Why are all these people here? Where is St Peter? Where are the pearly gates?"  Gabriel ignored his questions until he located his entry on his clipboard. "It says here you were the president of a large software company. Is that right?"  "Yes."  "Well then, do the maths, chip head. When heaven opened, only 100 people or so died every day. St Peter could handle them all himself, no problems. No there are over 5 billion people on earth. Jesus, when God said go forth and multiply, he didn't mean like rabbits! Now around 10,000 people die every hour, over a quarter of a million people every day. Do you think Peter can meet them all personally?"  "I guess not."  "You guessed right." So Peter had to franchise the operation. He's now the CEO of Team Peter Enterprises Inc. Just sits in the Corporate Headquarters and sets policy. Franchisees like me handle the actual inductions. Your paperwork seems to be inorder and with a background like yours, you'll be getting a plum job assignment."  "Job assignment?"  "Of course. Did you expect to spend the rest of eternity sitting on your arse and drinking ambrosia? Heavens a big operation. And you have to pull your weight." Gabriel had Bill sign a form in triplicate, then tore out the middle copy and handed it to him. "Take this form to Induction Centre 23 and meet up with your Occupational Orientator. His name is Abraham."  Bill started to ask a question. Gabriel interrupted "No, he's not that Abraham."  Gates walked down a long, muddy trail until he came to Induction Centre 23. After a mere six hour wait he met Abraham.  "Heaven is centuries behind in it's data processing infrastructure." explained Abraham. Were still doing everything on paper. It takes us a week to process new entries. Your job will be to supervise Heaven's new Data Processing Centre. We're putting in the largest computing facility in the history of creation. Half a million computers connected by a multi segment, fibre optic network, all running into a back end server with one thousand parallel Cyrix CPU's on a two gigabyte channel. Fully fault tolerant. Fully distributed processing. The works!"  "Wow!" said Bill. "What a great job. This really is Heaven!"  Abraham and Bill caught the shuttle bus and went to Heaven's new Data Processing Centre. It was a truly huge facility, 100 times the size of the SCG, with workmen crawling all over it. And in the middle, arranged in huge circles around a massive, house sized mainframe, were half a million computers in neat rows. Half a million.  "Macintoshes!" exclaimed Bill, horrified.  "All running ClarisWorks software. Not a single byte of Microsoft code. " said Abraham.  The thought of spending the rest of eternity using products hed spent his life trying to destroy was too much for Bill. "What about PC's?" he exclaimed. "What about Windows? What about Excel? What about Word?"  "This is Heaven", explained Abraham. We need a computer system that's heavenly to use. If you want to build a data processing centre based on PC's running Windows, then GO TO HELL!"

      This is an actual alert to IBM Field Engineers that went out to all IBM Branch Offices. The person who wrote it was very serious. The rest of us may find it rather funny.  Abstract: Mouse Balls Available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit)  Mouse balls are now available as FRU. Therefore, if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement. Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel. Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls. Ball removal procedures differ depending upon manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop-off method. Domestic balls are replaced using the twist-off method. Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge. Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used immediately. It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction, and that any customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these necessary items.  To re-order, specify one of the following:  P/N 33F8462 - Domestic Mouse Balls  P/N 33F8461 - Foreign Mouse Balls

       The help desk from hell.  Monday  8:05am  User called to say they forgot password. Told them to use password retrieval utility called FDISK. Blissfully ignorant, they thank me and hang up. God, we let the people vote and drive, too?  8:12am  Accounting called to say they couldn't access expense reports database. Gave them Standard Sys Admin Answer #112, "Well, it works for me." Let them rant and rave while I unplugged my coffeemaker from the UPS and plugged their server back in. Suggested they try it again. One more happy customer...  8:14 am  User from 8:05 call said they received error message "Error accessing Drive 0." Told them it was an OS problem. Transferred them to microsupport.  11:00 am  Relatively quiet for last few hours. Decide to plug support phone back in so I can call my girlfriend. Says parents are coming into town this weekend. Put her on hold and transferred her to janitorial closet down in basement. What is she thinking? The "Myst" and "Doom" nationals are this weekend!  11:34 am  Another user calls (do they ever learn?). Says they want ACL changed on HR performance review database so that nobody but HR can access database. Tell them no problem. Hang up. Change ACL. Add @MailSend so performance reviews are sent to /US.  12:00 pm  Lunch  3:30 pm  Return from lunch.  3:55 pm  Wake up from nap. Bad dream makes me cranky. Bounce servers for no reason. Return to napping.  4:23 pm  Yet another user calls. Wants to know how to change fonts on form. Ask them what chip set they're using. Tell them to call back when they find out.  4:55 pm  Decide to run "Create Save/Replication Conflicts" macro so next shift has something to do.  Tuesday  8:30 am  Finish reading support log from last night. Sounded busy. Terrible time with Save/Replication conflicts.  9:00 am  Support manager arrives. Wants to discuss my attitude. Click on PhoneNotes SmartIcon. "Love to, but kinda busy. Put something in the calendar database!" I yell as I grab for the support lines, which have (mysteriously) lit up. Walks away grumbling.  9:35 pm  Team leader from R&D needs ID for new employee. Tell them they need form J-19R="9C9"\DARRK1. Say they never heard of such a form. Tell them it's in the SPECIAL FORMS database. Say they never heard of such a database. Transfer them to janitorial closet in basement.  10:00 am  Perky sounding intern from R&D calls and says she needs new ID. Tell her I need employee number, department name, manager name, and marital status. Run @DbLookup against state parole board database, Centers for Disease Control database, and my Oprah Winfrey database. No hits. Tell her ID will be ready tonight. Drawing from the lessons learned in last week's "Reengineering for Customer Partnership," I offer to personally deliver ID to her apartment.  10:07 am  Janitor stops by to say he keeps getting strange calls in basement. Offer to train him on Notes. Begin now. Let him watch console while I grab a smoke.  1:00 pm  Return from smoking break. Janitor says phones kept ringing, so he transferred them to cafeteria lady. I like this guy.  1:05 pm  Big commotion! Support manager falls in hole left where I pulled floor tiles outside his office door. Stress to him importance of not running in computer room, even if I do yell "Omigod -- Fire!"  1:15 pm  Development Standards Committee calls and complains about umlauts in form names. Apologizing for the inconvenience, I tell them I will fix it. Hang up and run global search/replace using gaks.  1:20 pm  Mary Hairnet from cafeteria calls. Says she keeps getting calls for "Notice Loads" or "NoLoad Goats," she's not sure, couldn't here over industrial-grade blender. Tell her it was probably "Lettuce Nodes." Maybe the food distributor with a new product? She thinks about it and hangs up.  2:00 pm  Legal secretary calls and says she lost password. Ask her to check in her purse, floor of car, and on bathroom counter. Tell her it probably fell out of back of machine. Suggest she put duct tape over all the airvents she can find on the PC. Grudgingly offer to create new ID for her while she does that.  2:49 pm  Janitor comes back. Wants more lessons. I take off rest of day.  Wednesday  8:30 am  Irate user calls to say chipset has nothing to do with fonts on form. Tell them of course, they should have been checking "Bitset," not "chipset." Sheepish user apologizes and hangs up.  9:10am  Support manager, with foot in cast, returns to office. Schedules 10:00am meeting with me. User calls and wants to talk to support manager about terrible help at support desk. Tell them manager about to go into meeting. Sometimes life hands you material.....  10:00 am  Call Louie in janitorial services to cover for me. Go to support manager's office. He says he can't dismiss me but can suggest several lateral career moves. Most involve farm implements in third-world countries with moderate to heavy political turmoil. By and by, I ask if he's aware of new bug which takes full-text indexed random e-mail databases and puts all references to furry handcuffs and Bambi Boomer in Marketing on the corporate Web page. Meeting is adjourned as he reaches for keyboard, Web browser, and Tums.  10:30 am  Tell Louie he's doing great job. Offer to show him mainframe corporate PBX system sometime.  11:00 am  Lunch.  4:55 pm  Return from lunch.  5:00 pm  Shift change; Going home.  Thursday  8:00 am  New guy ("Marvin") started today. "Nice plaids" I offer. Show him server room, wiring closet, and technical library. Set him up with IBM PC-XT. Tell him to quit whining, Notes runs the same in both monochrome and color.  8:45 am  New guy's PC finishes booting up. Tell him I'll create new ID for him. Set minimum password length to 64. Go grab smoke.  9:30 am  Introduce Louie the custodian to Marvin. "Nice plaids" Louie comments. Is this guy great or what?!  11:00 am  Beat Louie in dominos game. Louie leaves. Fish spare dominos out of sleeves ("Always have backups"). User calls, says Accounting server is down. Untie Ethernet cable from radio antenna (better reception) and plug back into hub. Tell user to try again. Another happy customer!  11:55 am  Brief Marvin on Corporate Policy 98.022.01: "Whereas all new employee beginning on days ending in 'Y' shall enjoy all proper aspects with said corporation, said employee is obligated to provide sustenance and relief to senior technical analyst on shift."  Marvin doubts. I point to "Corporate Policy" database (a fine piece of work, if I say so myself!). "Remember, that's DOUBLE pepperoni and NO peppers!" I yell to Marvin as he steps over open floor tile to get to exit door.  1:00 pm  Oooooh! Pizza makes me so sleepy...  4:30 pm  Wake from refreshing nap. Catch Marvin scanning want ads.  5:00 pm  Shift change. Flick HR's server off and on several times (just testing the On/Off button...). See ya tomorrow.  Friday  8:00 am  Night shift still trying to replace power supply in HR server. Told them it worked fine before I left.  9:00 am  Marvin still not here. Decide I might start answering these calls myself. Unforward phones from Mailroom.  9:02 am  Yep. A user call. Users in Des Moines can't replicate. Me and the Oiuji board determine it's sunspots. Tell them to call Telecommunications.  9:30 am  Good God, another user! They're like ants. Says he's in San Diego and can't replicate with Des Moines. Tell him it's sunspots, but with a two-hour difference. Suggest he reset the time on the server back two hours.  10:17 am  Pensacola calls. Says they can't route mail to San Diego. Tell them to set server ahead three hours.  11:00 am  E-mail from corporate says for everybody to quit resetting the time on their servers. I change the date stamp and forward it to Milwaukee.  11:20 am  Finish @CoffeeMake macro. Put phone back on hook.  11:23 am  Milwaukee calls, asks what day it is.  11:25 am  Support manager stops by to say Marvin called in to quit. "So hard to get good help..." I respond. Support manager says he has appointment with orthopedic doctor this afternoon, and asks if I mind sitting in on the weekly department head meeting for him. "No problem!"  11:30 am  Call Louie and tell him opportunity knocks and he's invited to a meeting this afternoon. "Yeah, sure. You can bring your snuff" I tell him.  12:00 am  Lunch.  1:00 pm  Start full backups on UNIX server. Route them to device NULL to make them fast.  1:03 pm  Full weekly backups done. Man, I love modern technology!  2:30 pm  Look in support manager's contact management database. Cancel 2:45pm appointment for him. He really should be at home resting, you know.  2:39 pm  New user calls. Says want to learn how to create a connection document. Tell them to run connection document utility CTRL-ALT-DEL. Says PC rebooted. Tell them to call microsupport.  2:50 pm  Support manager calls to say mixup at doctor's office means appointment cancelled. Says he's just going to go on home. Ask him if he's seen corporate Web page lately.  3:00 pm  Another (novice) user calls. Says periodic macro not working. Suggest they place @DeleteDocument at end of formula. Promise to send them document addendum which says so.  4:00 pm  Finish changing foreground color in all documents to white. Also set point size to "2" in help databases.  4:30 pm  User calls to say they can't see anything in documents. Tell them to go to view, do a "Edit -- Select All", hit delete key, and then refresh. Promise to send them document addendum which says so.  4:45 pm  Another user calls. Says they can't read help documents. Tell them I'll fix it. Hang up. Change font to Wingdings.  4:58 pm  Plug coffee maker into Ethernet hub to see what happens. Not (too) much.  5:00 pm  Night shift shows up. Tell that the hub is acting funny and to have a good weekend.

      July 18 - I just tried to connect to America Online. I've heard it is the best online service I can get. They even included a free disk! I'd better hold onto it incase they don't ever send me anther one! I can't connect. I don't know what is wrong.  July 19 - Some guy at the tech support center says my computer needs a modem. I don't see why. He's just trying to cheat me. How dumb does he think I am?  July 22 - I bought the modem. I couldn't figure out where it goes. It wouldn't fit in the monitor or the printer. I'm confused.  July 23 - I finally got the modem in and hooked up. that nine year old next door did it for me. But it still don't work. I can't get online.  July 25 - That nine year old kid next door hooked me up to America Online for me. He's so smart. I told the kid he was a prodigy. But he says that's just another service. What a modest kid. He's so smart and he does these services for people. Anyway he's smarter then the jerks who sold me the modem. They didn't even tell me about communications software. Bet they didn't know. And why do they put two telephone jack holes in the back of a modem when you only need one? And why do they have one labeled phone when you are not suppose to hook it to the phone jack on the wall? I thought the dial tone sounded funny! Boy, are modem makers dumb! But the kid figured it out by the sound.  July 26 - What's the internet? I thought I was on America Online. Not this internet thing. I'm confused.  July 27 - The nine year old kid next door showed me how to use this America Online stuff. I told him he must be a genius. He says that he is compared to me. Maybe he's not so modest after all.  July 28 - I tried to use chat today. I tried to talk into my computer but nothing happened. maybe I need to buy a microphone.  July 29 - I found this thing called usenet. I got out of it because I'm connected to America Online not usenet.  July 30 - These people in this usenet thing keep using capital letters. How do they do that? I never figured out how to type capital letters. Maybe they have a different type of keyboard.  JULY 31 - I CALLED THE COMPUTER MAKER I BOUGHT IT FROM TO COMPLAIN ABOUT NOT HAVING A CAPITOL LETTER KEY. THE TECH SUPPORT GUY SAID IT WAS THIS CAPS LOCK KEY. WHY DIDN'T THEY SPELL IT OUT? I TOLD HIM I GOT A CHEAP KEYBOARD AND WANTED A BETTER ONE. AND ONE OF MY SHIFT KEYS ISNT THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER. HE SAID THATS A STANDARD. I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T WANT A STANDARD KEYBOARD BUT ANOTHER BRAND. I MUST HAVE HAD AN IMPORTANT COMPLAINT BECAUSE I HEARD HIM TELL THE OTHER SUPPORT GUYS TO LISTEN IN ON OUR CONVERSATION.  AUGUST 1 - I FOUND THIS THING CALLED THE USENET ORACLE. IT SAYS THAT IT CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I ASK IT. I SENT IT 44 SEPARATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTERNET. I HOPE IT RESPONDS SOON.  AUGUST 2 - I FOUND A GROUP CALLED REC.HUMOR. I DECIDED TO POST THIS JOKE ABOUT THE CHICKEN THAT CROSSED THE ROAD. TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE! HA! HA! I WASNT SURE I POSTED IT RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 56 MORE TIMES.  AUGUST 3 - I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE WORLD WIDE WEB. I DON'T NOW SPIDERS GREW THAT LARGE.  AUGUST 4 - THE ORACLE RESPONDED TO MY QUESTIONS TODAY. GEEZ IT WAS RUDE. I WAS SO ANGRY THAT I POSTED AN ANGRY MESSAGE ABOUT IT TO REC.HUMOR.ORACLE. I WASNT SURE IF I POSTED RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 22 MORE TIMES.  AUGUST 5 - SOMEONE TOLD ME TO READ THE FAQ. GEEZ THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO USE PROFANITY.  AUGUST 6 - SOMEONE ELSE TOLD ME TO STOP SHOUTING IN ALL MY MESSAGES. WHAT A STUPID JERK. IM NOT SHOUTING! IM NOT EVEN TALKING! JUST TYPING! HOW CAN THEY LET THESE RUDE JERKS GO ON THE INTERNET?  August 7 - Why have a Caps Lock key if you're not suppose to use it? Its probably an extra feature that costs more money.  August 8 - I just read this post called make money fast. I'm so exited. I'm going to make lots of money. I followed his instructions and posted it to every newsgroup I could find.  August 9 - I just made my signature file. Its only 6 pages long. I will have to work on it some more.  August 10 - I just looked at a group called alt.aol.sucks. I read a few posts and I really believe that aol should be wiped off the face of the earth. I wonder what an aol is.  August 11 - I was asking where to find some information about something. Some guy told me to check out ftp.netcom.com. I've looked and looked but I can't find that group.  August 12 - I sent a post to every usenet group on the Internet asking where the ftp.netcom.com is. hopefully someone will help. I can't ask the kid next door. His parents said that when he comes back from my house he's laughing so hard he can't eat or sleep or do his homework. So they wont let him come over anymore. I do have a great sense of humor. I don't know why the rec.humor group didn't like my chicken joke. Maybe they only like dirty stuff. Some people sent me posts about my 56 posts of the joke and they used bad words.  August 13 - I sent another post to every usenet group on the Internet asking where the ftp.netcom.com is. I had forgot yesterday to include my new signature file which is only 8 pages long. I know everyone will want to read my favorite poem so I included it. I'm also going to add that short story I like.  August 14 - Some guy suspended my account because of what I was doing. I told him I don't have an account at his bank. He's so dumb.

      Hello readers, 'tis I, the legendary Black Bunny of Hell! (Bwahahaha and all that stuff.)  Anyhow, a new version of the Mozilla Firebird browser has been released. Only now it's not called Firebird any more, it is now called Firefox (not to be confused with the movie of the same name) due to Firebird being the name of a different opensource project.  All the features you know and love are there and have been made bug-free and it only takes a few minutes to download over a broadband connection so you really have nothing to lose.  There is a link to the right and also a download in the downloads section.

       with apologies to Edgar Allen Poe   Once upon a midnight dreary, Upgrading to 98, and oh so weary, Whence upon mine eyes that were so bleary, Fell an image I am now fearing.  My disk is not optimized oh so well? Fat 32 shall correct this so please don't dwell, The fate of my data in it's hands fell, My format did it sent straight to Hell.  It stores much better it did claim, Something mistrustful in it's name, Fat 32 convertor, was I insane? Yet I guess I am to blame.  So onward forth did I care free tread, Images of recombined data in my head, Lack of sleep making my eyes go red, So with the process I went ahead.  Ready to reboot it deftly quoted, Dreams of extra space in my head floated, More space at no cost it softly purported, Lordship of my data it quietly gloated.  Waiting and waiting my confidence shrank, Watching my screen slowly go blank, Inward into itself my computer shrank, And for this whom have I to thank?  What doth thou mean invalid partition? All of my data consumed by this Gryphon, If I only knew before I would be soon be wishing, My allocation tables I was not risking.  I knew then that my OS crashed, Within the disk, formats clashed, Blinking lights on my computer flashed, Thoroughly my data it had trashed.  After several minutes I did look, Within the holy instructions book, It said there was no chance in what I took, I felt as though I had been rooked.  The repair disk the book claimed to need, Was the one the computer refused to read, Would not repair the result of my greed, For hard drive space that I did not need.  In my haste and wanton lust, For hard drive space it was a bust, Tools in which I did place my trust, Betrayed me only to leave me lost.  In the wee hours of the morning, If you hear a soft little groaning, Know it is but I my hard drive moaning, For which my format I am mourning.

      1 (TIE) Two greedy Richards. Richard the First In August, the board of the New York Stock Exchange decides to give CEO Dick Grasso his $139.5 million pension up front, ostensibly to save the estimated $10 million it would cost to deliver the payout at retirement. Grasso offers a succinct if not altogether satisfying explanation: "I'm blessed." When a firestorm erupts over Grasso's payday, he graciously agrees not to take another $48 million he has coming to him. Then, a week later, Grasso "resigns"—and quickly claims he was fired, which entitles him to another $58 million, including the $48 million he had promised to forgo.  Richard the Second In October, New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer's wide-ranging investigation of the mutual-fund industry reveals that Dick Strong, the founder and chairman of Strong Financial, has made $600,000—the equivalent of about 60 bucks to a regular working stiff—through market-timing trades contrary to his own company's rules. He's forced to resign and may have to sell his nearly 90 percent stake in the firm, valued at just under $1 billion.   3 Don't hate the player. Hate the game. In September, retail chain Urban Outfitters begins peddling Ghettopoly, a Monopoly knockoff. The top hat, shoe, and car are replaced with a machine gun, marijuana leaf, basketball, and rock of crack cocaine. Reacting to protests, Urban Outfitters pulls the game from its stores.  4 The next day, Count Chocula drops by to pick up an application. Dairy Queen franchisee W.A. Enterprises is docked $700,000 by a jury in Richmond, Va., after DQ employee Ayman Ahmed Hasaballa allegedly slides into a booth next to a female customer, pulls down her sweater, bites her breast, and says, "I am like Dracula." The jury holds the company responsible because it didn't fire Hasaballa six months earlier after he allegedly attacked a female co-worker.  5 If we accuse them of backpedaling, does that make them a target? "We deeply regret that comments made by on-air personalities were misinterpreted. Clear Channel does not condone advocating violence in any form."—Clear Channel Radio CEO John Hogan, after disc jockeys at three of the company's stations urge listeners to attack bicyclists with tactics that include slamming on car brakes, throwing open car doors suddenly, and beaning riders with soda bottles.   6 The company places the blame on junior analyst Mary Jane Bogart, a chronic underachiever who never has the straight dope and often fails to weed out her own mistakes. Research firm Nielsen/NetRatings issues a report describing a website called the Blunt Truth as "an educational resource for marijuana." It's actually an online game site in which teens reveal secrets to one another anonymously.  7 The annual Pearl Harbor Day bash, however, is a real blast. In August, online "social planning destination" Evite sends an apology to its users for having cited Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, as a "reason to party" in an earlier e-mail newsletter.  8 Just to be on the safe side, let's also lose the jack, the fuel pump, and the four-stroke engine. In Canada, General Motors is forced to come up with a new name for its Buick LaCrosse sedan after discovering that crosse is a slang term for masturbation in Quebec.  9 It then opens a new store in La Crosse, Wis. In April, Swedish furniture giant Ikea explains that a children's bunk bed called the Gutvik is named for "a tiny town in Sweden." Announcing that bit of etymology becomes necessary when Germans point out that, in their neck of the woods, the word sounds like a phrase that means "good f***." Ikea yanks the Gutvik from its catalogs in Germany.  10 Buick LaCrosse buyers were sorely disappointed. In November, Chrysler announces that it will sponsor the Lingerie Bowl, a football game to be played by female models airing as a pay-per-view special during halftime of the Super Bowl. After the carmaker comes under fire for the sexist nature of the event, CEO Dieter Zetsche quickly distances himself from the spectacle, claiming he had no knowledge that it was in the works. The company reportedly pressures the event's producers to change the players' uniforms, demanding that participants wear sports bras and volleyball shorts; then, a week later, it drops the event altogether.

      I don't know who found it first, but I just had forwarded to me what has to be the most ambitious web site user agreement of all time, from the home page of the Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum. "Ridiculously overreaching" doesn't even begin to describe it.  The legalese is an astonishing 21,000 words long, and gives every sign of having been professionally drafted by a competent lawyer with severe OCD. It's not quite that any individual term is clearly insane as that the redundancy makes the whole much less than the sum of its parts. We've been cracking each other up by reading selections aloud. Some highlights inside:      "All other access, use, disclosure, reproduction, delayed use, reduction to human-perceivable form, printing, copying or saving of digital image files or other content, reformatting, file sharing, downloading, uploading, storing, posting, mirroring, archiving, recording, distributing, redistribution, repurposing, modification, rewriting, manipulation, creation of derivative works, translations, or products, licensing, sale, transfer, display, public performance, publicity, broadcast, televising, reporting, publication (in whole or part) or transmission whether by http, ftp, electronic mail or any other file transfer protocol, and whether by electronic means or otherwise, or use by other than individual scholars, or commercial use requires prior written permission of the rights owner(s) and payment of a fee, and severe penalties apply for theft and unauthorized publication, which is also a crime."       "You agree that your use of this website is irrefutable acknowledgment by you that you have read, understood, and agreed to each and every term and provision of this User Agreement . . . ." (emphasis added).       "You stipulate, warrant and agree that you will not . . . challenge or dispute validity of our copyright."       "The application of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded."       "You are warned that computer viruses can be transmitted via e-mail, so the recipient of any e-mail should check it and any attachments for the presence of viruses."       "[Y]ou should print a paper copy of this User Agreement . . . ."       "Time is of the essence hereof."       "If you want permission, we sincerely hope that you don't get scared off by all this legalese and give up!"       "Telephone calls placed in disregard of the foregoing will be charged at two hundred fifty dollars per telephone call."       "Licensee acknowledges that 19th century images such as 3 1/2" stereograph albumen prints are of limited resolution and are generally degraded, containing various imperfections of image and mount due to aging, and damaged, including but not limited to foxing, spotting, chipping, cracking, abrasion, folding, tearing, gouging, emulsion loss, soiling, staining, glue streaking, discoloration, motion blurring, darkening, and fading (often uneven in degree over various parts of an image), and acknowledges that images rescanned or photoduplicated from the original as a result of its request may require additional processing or restoration."       "Additionally, in the event that your actions in violation of this User Agreement result in our being deprived of our exclusive rights . . . you agree to pay us liquidated damages in the amount of five million U.S. dollars . . . ."       "Please read this Legal Notice of Infringement which applies to you only if you have violated this User Agreement, or made any use of this website in any way not specifically authorized and permitted herein, in which case you acknowledge timely receipt hereof, which you agree is sufficient notice, at such time as you commenced violation of this User Agreement."       "You further assume the risk that certain historic subjects, accidents, attitudes, and stereotypes and descriptions or depictions thereof, some graphic, may prove to be disturbing and that warnings and rating filters relating to such content may be absent or ineffective."       "Access to or use of this website in any jurisdiction that does not allow the exclusion of implied warranties is strictly prohibited."       "You agree to immediately notify CPRR.org by e-mail of any errors, historical inaccuracies, technical problems, typographical errors, broken links, incorrect or missing citations, proprietary content included without required permission, or any other defects or deficiencies which you discover on this website . . . ."       "Force Majeuere: Additionally, in not in limitation of the forgoing, we shall not have liability for any failure or delay resulting from any condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to illness, governmental action, or acts of terrorism, earthquake or other natural occurrences, labor conditions, or power failure."       The parties hereto agree and stipulate . . . that such images are not in the public domain, that this website is a compilation posessing originality with new material added, and that copyright law does not preempt contract law."

      In 2 days time I'm going on a school trip to the WW1 battlefields in Belgium so I won't be updating from the 31st to the 2nd. It should be quite good, we get to muck about on the bus for about 7 hours and it'll be a 3 star hotel so it should be quite comfortable. I'll be sure to tell you about it when we get back but for now, bye.

Getting a NVQ at the end of it so it isn't useless. Friend of mine is getting UT2k4, his name's gonna be "Brother_Gomez" (minus the quote marks), he's a good guy so don't frag him too much. Well, that's all I've got to say for the moment, adios comrades.

      Hey there, sorry for not updating for a while, I've been really busy, upgrading my PC, playing UT, etc. Tommorow is the europe release date of UT2K4, YAY!!!!. As you can tell, I'm quite excited about it. I will be going to Belgium for 3 days soon, school trip, so I won't be able to update at that time. A friend of mine has a good website you may want to check out, she is very good at anime art. The site's also got track listings for all of the radio stations on GTA:Vice City (she really plays that game too much). Go to her site by following this  urlLink LINK .

      Hi, just completely reinstalled the OS on my PC, currently running win2k, I'm installing the Linux partition as soon as I can get the sound card to work. I'm going to try to get through the filtering on the computers at school, the filter runs on a proxy at the isp so I can't just turn off a system process. The proxy I'm going to attempt to use is 81.137.45.114 port 80. It's based in the UK and it works. Wish me luck.

      Just recently got Mozilla Firefox 0.9 installed and running nicely, the extension and theme dialogs look nice, I'm currently using noia eXtreme as the theme, nice icons. I would suggest that you take a look at the mycroft project if you do download it, the project has a lot of search plugins that you can use, there's also a part in the extension section of Mozilla update that contains the 20 most used plugins. Flash was a breeze to get working, although macromedia only gives out a command-line client to install flash but it installed easily for all you people who are complete newbies when it comes to one of the worlds best operating systems. I attempted to get Soldner: Secret Wars to work on my windoze partition but it just won't work, I mean for starters I had to overclock my puny 1250mhz processor to 1667mhz to actually get enough speed out of it and it still doesn't work, I've got the latest drivers and nothing should be going wrong but it always crashes to desktop just after the first loading screen. If any of you know how to fix this please e-mail me, (anything) @theblackbunnyofhell.co.uk will get to me. One of the problems of OCing my processor is that MDK suddenly got all unstable, kept on freezing up, really quite annoying, still, easily fixed. I've got 2 GMail accounts left, anyone want 'em, e-mail me, thatpenguinguy@gmail.com.

      I'm writing this particular rant because someone was stupid enough to say that windoze is actually any good. They say this because of the market share, not stability, usability or anything else. The idiot said that just because windoze has more users, it's better than Linux. If the majority of people were fascist would that be good? The answer is no. In other news, one of the GMail invites has been sold, 2 week rental of Soldner: Secret Wars so if anybody has any offers like or better than that just email me, thatpenguinguy@gmail.com I have 2 left so make sure you get yours before someone else does.

      Just a _very_ quick how-to on setting up a telnet server in win2k/nt. Just go Start -> Run -> tlntadmn.exe. Then you can change the settings, turn it on, off, etc. You can also run ipconfig from a DOS prompt to find your IP. The user accounts will be the same as on the host PC.

      Hi there, I may be doing web radio in the near future, the company that makes  urlLink Shareaza  has created a new P2P radio application called  urlLink Mercora . I will probably put together a few good playlists from my large collection of music and I will stream anything you suggest as soon as I get hold of it. In other news, in a recent study it has been found that  urlLink Ducks have regional accents . What is most funny about his is that somebody actually funded this. Still, that's all I have right now, adios.

      I haven't been posting for a while because I've had a lot on my plate. At the moment here near Bristol it is bloody hot. Really bloody hot. I've recently been playing about with a n64 emulator, it's quite good, I've been playing Conkers BFD. Started to get into flying kites, got one of them delta jobs, got it at a boot sale for about 3 quid, had to get some new strings and some other stuff though but still, the kite usually retail at around 50 pounds so I got a pretty good deal. Anyway, that's all I've got at the moment, I'll post again when something interesting happens.

      Nothing at all has happened since I last posted. Absolutely nada, nout, nothing. It's been really very boring. My school is digging up 45% of the field to make space for an astroturf pitch, don't have a clue why but they decided to do it anyway. I've put together a small .bat file that I hope to try out sometime on the school network. It'll flood the system with messages when it's run. The message it sends is "I am the ghost in your machine, I will walk on your grave", it's a quote from an old game called AI, it seemed appropriate a the time. If anyone would like to sponsor a message then just e-mail me. One thing happened online that's quite interesting, it seems that M$ is stabbing itself in the back, on  urlLink Slate , owned by M$, they are advising people to use  urlLink Firefox  instead of M$'s own  urlLink Crap Browser .
