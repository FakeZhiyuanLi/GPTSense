      We met with the production manager and brand manager yesterday at the workroom.  Apparently our first collection of clothes is selling well, which is really cool because it went into the store so late.  Also discussed our new stuff for summer, everything seems to be going well.  We are looking at an early September delivery.  Now I just need to finalise some of the art work and make some new swing tags etc. etc.

       urlLink    In Thailand, kao soi is made with ba mee, a variety of egg noodles, that can be difficult to find in the U.S. But lo meinstyle Chinese egg noodles are a good substitute.  4 cups vegetable oil 3/4 lb. fresh lo mein-style egg noodles 1 tbsp. Thai red pepper (coarsely ground) or cayenne pepper 3 tbsp. Thai red curry paste 1 tbsp. Madras-style curry powder 1 tsp. ground cumin 2 1/4 cups unsweetened coconut milk 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 2 tbsp. nam pla (Thai fish sauce) 1 tsp. sugar 1 lb. boneless chicken breast, cut in 2''3'' pieces 34 scallions, white parts only, chopped 2 shallots, peeled and quartered 1/3 cup pickled cabbage, rinsed and julienned 2 limes, halved  1. Heat about 3 1/2 cups oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add a large handful of noodles and cook until crisp, about 1 minute. Remove noodles immediately and drain on paper towels. Pour off frying oil (which can be reused 23 times; strain and store in a closed container until needed), wipe out wok, then add 2 tbsp. fresh oil. Heat over medium-high heat, then add red pepper and fry, stirring constantly, until oil begins to smoke, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and stir in enough remaining oil, about 3 tbsp., to form a thick chile oil. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.  2. Wipe out wok, then add curry paste, curry powder, and cumin, and cook, stirring, over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Stir in coconut milk and stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, add nam pla and sugar, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Stir in chicken and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes more. (Add up to 1 cup of water if soup is too thick.)  3. Cook remaining noodles by blanching in a large pot of boiling water until soft, about 1 minute. Drain, then refresh under cold water.  4. Divide noodles among 4 soup bowls, ladle soup into bowls, and top with scallions and fried noodles. Serve with shallots, pickled cabbage, chile oil, and limes. &nbsp; urlLink
