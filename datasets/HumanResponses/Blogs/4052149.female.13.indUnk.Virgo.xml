"... you see, i was hoping that it was like noon... and that my appointment was at like 1230 or something.. but nooo, i look over at the clock.. at its 9 in the morning.&nbsp; I couldnt be woken up like 10 minutes before my appointment.. but I had to be woken up 1 freaking hour earlier.&nbsp; Ohhh, I was pissed.&nbsp; Its not too bad.. im supposed to be home alone for a bit today.. but i think my dad isnt leaving.&nbsp; Psssh, oh well.&nbsp; Is anyone up for hanging out today?..

      im awake at 815.   i woke up at 630 something.  mal came to my house at 630 something and woke me up.  then we woke up brittney and sara.  then graham and alex came over.  we went to lights, i  was too tired to eat so i just had hot chocolate.  really, youve got to be kidding.  why the hell am i awake.  normally, i would have 3 hours yet to sleep.  jasdifjaklsjd.  yeah.  so. yeah.  well, sara, britt, mal, alex, and graham are here.  i dunno why im on here, but im tired.  very tired.  well, theyre talking about a kid who wants a dick thats longer than a foot...i find it amusing, but yeahhhhh.  wow.  well, idk who the heck would be crazy enough to wake up this early like us.  i wanna go lie edown but everyone has taken up all the room on the couch, and we dont have the bed in here anymore, and the floor is  too hard.  im just gunna sit here still.  lol.. i find it amusing that i no longer have a boyfriend, and i really dont mind.  last time we broke up, i was a mess... this time, its just funny.  idk, i cried at first but then i found it pathetic cause i wasnt even really sad just kinda..just really.. idk.. i have no idea... i was in like a melancholy mood.. where i was sad, but  really.. wasnt sad.. just dissapointed in a way? who knows.  i think i just cried cause i havent in a really long time and i was on some pain killers.  it was barely crying though, i got teary eyed.. and then i laughed a bit.  sorry if this your reading this and its a bit harsh hodge... i havent said anythign to anyone and so its just easier to write a journal entry, and its not like the whole world wouldnt know within a week or two.     anyway.. i need to vent a bit more.  idk if i like the kid anymore, i dont really think i do.. but we just went out for a frickin long time, so its just a ton of memories that i cant really forget.  our relationship rrreally sucked for a while, so i was expecting it.  so thats why i wasnt really sad.. cause i knew it was just gunna be like that for the rest of the time we went out anyway, but i thought about the great times we had, thats just what made me sad.  yeahh, thats it.  i dont like how things were the past few weeks.. but i loved the rest of the time we were together.  thats all, so some good and bad things.  i really dont like him anymore...its just only been a matter of like a day and a half since we broke up, so im not gunna completely drop everything and forget about it that fast.  gimme a few more days to a week.  haha, just kidding.  gimme a while, things'll turn out alright.  i just hope he didnt dump me for another person.  that tends to happen to me.  ouch.
