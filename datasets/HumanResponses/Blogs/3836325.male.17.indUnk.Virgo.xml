Unlike some other people who just have strict teachers, I have a teacher that is convince that all our class ar losers, and are destined to work in fast food joints, and shining their shoes. bah. I shine no-ones shoes! Anyhoo, apart from the bland boring stuff, (the stuff thats just me bitching) I have some rather important news.    &nbsp;  Behold the new name in Alt. Rock/Trance...

       I really hate how the majority of my gender gives the minority a bad name. I'll give you an example:    &nbsp;  A female frend of mine, i'll call her jo for privacy, used to date another friend of mine, lance (name changed). After about 10 months of separation, lance asks jo out, and jo is still in love with lance, but 2 hours later he claims that he can't get romantically involved with anyone because he's going to join the army. (in england) Now he knew that jo was still interested in him, but he didn't care. and of course he denies it, straight to jo's face. asshole.    &nbsp;  Jared

      Welp, I'm back at school. Yay. fun.  Its not all bad, its nice to see people I only see at school, and the common room is a unique experience. Just think of it as a lunch room only for Year 12s (final year). many a topic is raised, like the use of the legality of fornicating with ones sister, the proper use of a vacuum cleaner (even discussing those dyson cyclone bagless... *shudd3r*) and other weird pheonomena. The majority of the time its just a place to sit and relax away from the stress of VCE. (HSC for every other Australian)  Anyhoo, the classes are still the same, and I get to start my project in Visual Communication. whoopee! For the uneducate, thats graphic design. I've taken on the task of designing a Heavy Fighter for Freelancer! hopefully I can get a MS3D model to Harrier and Parabolix so they can use it in Epsilon.  Thats enough from me for now. Laters!=)  Jared

      Just got back from my friend's house, shooting some stuff for his Media project: a trailer for a movie about cool guys abducting nerds to make them into jocks. Now I didn't know the story before I signed up for this caper. No-one told me about the fight scene i had to do... and no-one told me I was an evil ass. (I only found this stuff out -after- the fight scene started...) Still it was fun having to choreograph a fight scene because of the lack of preparation on the director's behalf. I wanted to shoot it again, knowing where each blow would come from, but sadly, this was not so. If I get a hold of a copy, I'll post it on a website, including all the outtakes =).  Anyway, I now have gravel rash from falling on ashphalt. Ouch.  Jared

      If anyone cant remember the wonderfulness of the mother know as Doom, then you are missing out on lots. I just went through the first episode of Doom 1 (Knee Deep in the Dead) on Nightmare difficulty. Lets say my trigger finger is no longer itchy. It reminds me why I loved that game in the first place. The only thing that could make it better would be to play Rammstein or System of a Down or Iron Maiden's Hallowed Be Thy Name in the background. Nope, looks like I got everything.=D  Jake

      Just a word of warning: Whatever you do, DONT listen to Evanescence when you're feeling blue. It does jack shit to make you feel better. Its beautiful music, yes, but it brings you down like a sack of shit.  However, on the CD which has my Evanescence songs on it, it also has VAST. VAST are an awsome pick me up band. Proof that life is a double edged sword.  But most of the time it just shits me. I just hope that a therapist doesnt read this and try to talk me out of suicide. Because no. 1: If I were suicidal, no-one could talk me out of it. and no. 2: Suicide is the easy way out. I like to take the long road and walk it. (shameless quoting of the music) But there are times at which I feel that I want to end it all. And then I remember that I eventually want to live, and that it isn't as futile as it seems. Those days are some of the best.  Even though I seem whiny and bitchy at time, I have to look on the bright side of life. If I didn't, I surely would have topped myself a long time ago. wooo optimism!=)

      I haven't done much today, other than some homework, and some other chores.  It's gotten weird between me and a friend of mine. You know that feeling when if you become friends with a chick, and you end up screwing up, attempting to ask her out, and being declined? I got the weirdness from the aftermath right now. And it's driving me nuts. My concious mind knows that nothing will come from this, but somewhere deep within me, a part of me still wants her. I can't change other people's minds, however, and if I tried, I would just fail misirably. Such is life. *sigh*  Jared

      This is basically the story of my life. Hopefully it will be more interesting to read about it than have me talk about it non-stop to the people i know.  My name is Jared Tyers, I live in Melbourne, and I'm 17, almost 18. I'm single and not loving it, and I play video games to entertain my mind. I'm a writer, a musician, and artist and a designer. I'd like to believe I am all those, but I can't judge myself accurately, so I don't talk much about how good something looks that I've done.  But away from my pessimistic side, I'm actually an optimist, beliving that thing could always be worse, and that what I have done could be done no other way. Every now and then I slip into a depressed state, and hate the world. But those moods are usually short lived and my positive side shows through. (jeez, i sound like an infomercial=D.)  Anyway, check back for the world of Jared, also known as Jake Langley, IV:XX, and of course, Viator.  PS: for those who are curious, Viator is latin for Traveller. I got it from Final Fantasy VIII.=D

       My humble computer is going in for an upgrade, and is getting a bit of knifework done...  it reminds me of something a famous person said.  "640Kb (RAM) should be enough for anybody."  now who said it? none other than  bill gates!   Jared
