      Today is another day sat at this desk, sat at this computer, whilst working from home.&nbsp; My normal routes of pretending that it doesn't drive me insane, are: dancing madly around my kitchen to loud music which sounds like hamsters on speed, talking to a squirrel who comes and sits and eats out of a purpose built hanging basket or accosting the postman into having a chat.&nbsp; So, I thought a blog might entertain me, even if it bores the pants off everyone else!  &nbsp;  This job - working for an internet based&nbsp;company, who are actually great fun to be with but are about 60 miles away from me and it makes it tricky when I want to make a cup of coffee for everyone but it&nbsp;is my bread and butter, whilst I am training to be a sound healer.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I am currently working my way through case studies and a thesis to finish my qualification but I feel this training has been going on since I popped into this world.&nbsp; Everything which has happened to me has bought me to here and I really like here.&nbsp; People moan and whinge and say the world is a terrible place but really thats a matter of perception.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Maybe I was brought up on a diet of Monty Python and that has a lot to answer for?!  &nbsp;  I love doing the sound healing - I love singing - I love watching people's reactions to what I do and I love music.&nbsp; I am looking for people's comments on how music moves them.&nbsp; To me, it creates an emotion, a feeling which is beyond words but that has never stopped me trying to explain.&nbsp; Music has bought me towards so many people who would normally have been shy to come up and talk.&nbsp; I used to be a DJ and people would hug me and would chat chat chat about the smallest sounds and noises which they adored.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As I explore using my voice, I get the same reaction ... a connection with people and a connection with the Universe. &nbsp; I had an epithany a while ago and decided that working in the City for a corporate business just wasn't for me and so I packed it all in and decided to try and find out what i really wanted from life ... what being truly authentic means to me.&nbsp; I have met some interesting people along the way and I have certainly had a few highs and a few lows on really trying to understand what really makes me tick.&nbsp; I certainly don't have any regrets for the things I have done in the past but I do feel like I have stopped thrashing around and everything has simplified itself as a result. &nbsp; I am, I guess a spiritual person and everyday presents another bit of my path in front of me but I love the balance of dark and light in everyone and I find it fascinating watching people transform into something 'more' as they examine their choices in life.&nbsp;  &nbsp; This is why I love sound - it doesn't judge.

       My lovely man is currently indoors with me, suffering from 'all the aches'.&nbsp; He does look grim but I realise I really am a rampant, active Aries at heart.&nbsp; One part of me is wanting to fuss him and keep him at home forever (it beats talking to my buddha statue) and the other part is like wishing him better at speed.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Where has my play mate gone. My sparky demon lover who understands me when I make jokes about Jesus-on-a-stick.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I know he is ill because I gave him a connoction to drink (which included honey with toast crumbs in it) and he just drank it!
