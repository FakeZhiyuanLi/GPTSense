      I just wrote a poem called "Falling Apart Again" and put it to music. It took me about 30 minutes to write the poem, and about 15 minutes to write the vocals and music. I surprised myself. It sounds pretty good. It's another deep, insightful poem. I remember when I was in the hospital after one of my surgeries. I had an internal infection and they didn't know if I was going to live. I wanted to see the sky, so the nurse wheeled my bed to the hall where there was a big window. I was giving up on life. I was dying. My wife was too fucked up on oxycontin and zanax to come see me. I was in the hospital for over a month and she only brought my daughter Tasha to visit me twice. The hall was glowing from the sunshine, and I thought maybe this is the angel's hall and they were coming to take me. I remember being wheeled to the window, and thinking if a crow comes to me, my time is up. I didn't see any crow.  I hiked the back trails at Core Creek Park to play my guitar and sing. It's peaceful back here. My local getaway. I saw several crow, and it reminded me of when I almost died in the hospital, looking for crow in the angel's hall. It's a beautiful day with cumulus clouds puffing up in the sky. A butterfly came to visit me. Was it a sign? The butterfly visited me and the crow flew away.  I can sense that my love is out there somewhere, and her spirit has found me. Watching, waiting, everywhere. I'll know her when we meet. I'm finding reasons to live. My life will be a good life. It's coming together now, but it still falls apart.  They say if a crow visits you, it's a sign of death. The crow didn't visit me today. Another reason to live. I'm up, I'm down, I'm up, I'm down.  It's all coming together now...  and it's falling apart again...    Falling Apart Again    Can you see the angel's hall Can you here the gypsy call Can you see clouds in the sky Can you here the reasons why  This is where I want to go To sing a song, to watch the crow I can sense you're always there Watching, waiting, everywhere  (Chorus) It's all coming together now And it's falling apart again It's changing like the weather now And it's falling apart again   I have seen the angel's hall I can hear the gypsy call I can see clouds in the sky Giving me the reasons why  This is where I'll always go Singing songs and watching crow And I know you're always there Watching, waiting, everywhere  (Chorus)  -

      (Notes &amp; poem from 7/28/04)  It's so beautiful here in the old growth forest. These trees are 200-300 feet tall and 4 feet in diameter. I'm surprised I didn't come here sooner. I wish I could've shown this to my daughter Tasha. Maybe someday...  It's been raining a lot this summer. I just wrote a poem called "Longfellow Trail". The pain comes through in my poems. I should try writing happy poems. Na! When I fall in love I'll write happy poems. What I write now are deep, emotional, reflective soul-searching poems. I write them for music. I create the music later. It's weird. I'm here where I want to be, and I love it here in the mountains. But I can't help feeling really lonely. I don't like being around crowds, and I love to hike trails where no one's around. It's what I do. The rain here is starting. It reminds me of the emptiness in my heart. I sit here where I'm happiest, but I'm so sad and lonely. I come to these places and take in the beauty, longing for someone to share it with. I dream about love when I'm here. Someday...  When this lonely feeling hits me, I don't feel like being around people. What I long for is someone to love. I want to love someone and someone love me so bad. Someone who would love to hike in this old growth forest. I guess I need two things in life. Someone to love, and the mountains. I here children coming up the trail. A family. A happy family. How beautiful. That was me long ago, with Tasha, 4 years old, asking her Daddy questions like "Daddy, are there any bears here?" "Daddy, can you put me on your shoulders?" It breaks my heart. The tears are coming again. Just like the rain. I need somebody to love. To help me wipe away this pain. It hurts so much.  This pain, this loss, is driving me. My emotions are driving me. Without them, I would be dead. The sun will shine again, shine down on me, and I will be happy again. She'll be smiling for me then, on Longfellow Trail...  Well, it's time to go. I have to hike down the mountain and then drive 4 1/2 hours. I don't want to be driving on the turnpike late at night. The last time I did it changed my life forever...      Longfellow Trail     It's starting to rain again I'm feeling my pain again I'm looking for love again On Longfellow Trail  See her waiting for me then She'll be smiling for me then Sun is shining on me then On Longfellow trail  (Chorus) Sun shining down on me On Longfellow Trail My lover fantasy On Longfellow Trail This is where I'll always be On Longfellow Trail   I feel so lonely here So melancholy here I'll always come back here On Longfellow Trail  The skies are darker now Rains falling harder now Feels like I'm drowning now On Longfellow Trail  (Chorus)

       urlLink    My pack; Tasha, Blue, and Thunder. Oooh, how I miss them. This is my Daughter and my baby boys. She's 18 now. I love her so much and I love my baby boys. I can't stop the tears. I wrote a poem that I'm going to put to music and make a song.   Haunting Me So Sad   I'm Thinking about you now Stuffed animals and teeshirts Happily ever after stories Somehow it always hurts  I miss you so much now Missing Thunder, missing Blue How we used to go hiking How we learned, how we grew  (Chorus) All my dreams and inspirations All my trials and tribulations All my scenes and situations All my troubles and frustrations Haunting me so bad Haunting me so sad   I dreamed of you again Dreamed of Thunder, dreamed of Blue Happy times spent together All the things we used to do  My life's so empty now Barren desert surrounds me Rusted spirits, broken soul Haunted dungeons, never free  (Chorus)

      This is my poem. This is me.    A Forest   I find myself walking through a forest In quest of a dream I had long ago Where happiness and peace and love overflow  I find myself walking through a forest Escaping the pain from my troubled past The memories, like nightmares, forever last  I find myself walking through a forest Traversing my path, crossing my stream Searching my soul in quest of a dream  I find myself walking through a forest Walking through a forest, I find myself

      My new pack wanted me to take them to Gettysburg and be their tour guide since I've had previous experience with ghosts there. They wanted ghosts. Be careful of what you wish for... Well, I came up with this idea. I learned how to sing and play "When Johnny Comes Marching Home". I played it in A minor. I wanted to serenade to the haunted spirits that roam the fields and woods of Gettysburg. Some people think I'm crazy. I am just trying to live to its fullest and howl at the moon.  Well, we got to Devil's Den at 9:40 pm. We started walking around. My pack was taking pics. My camera is at my ex wife's and I'll probably never see it again. We felt the spirits all around us. We walked to the Triangular Field and I started singing lightly (without guitar). At the top left corner of the Triangular Field, I started feeling a cold spot, then it got hot. My chest felt like it was getting squeezed and electricity was running through my veins. We walked into the field and the feeling left. We ran into a couple from Illinois taking pics. We could see orbs from the flashes. The lady told us last time she was there, something pushed her from behind real hard, though no one was there. It left a mark on her back.  We left the Triangular Field and headed back to Devil's Den. Everyone was leaving. It was 10:00 and the park closes at 10. I wanted to play my guitar. We went back to the truck, and I pulled out my guitar and sat on the wall facing the Slaughter Pen in front of Plum Run. I started playing and singing "When Johnny Comes Marching Home". I learned to play it nice and slow, giving it a creepy, eerie, haunted sound. About halfway through the song, I heard a woman singing with me in front of me. At first, I thought it was our pack female, but she doesn't sing. Then I heard more voices singing both in front of me and behind me. When I finished, I said to Margie, "were you singing? Somebody was singing!" She said no, but she heard a whole bunch of   people singing and it wasn't coming from our pack! She told me to play it again. I played it again and I had a haunted chorus join me. My whole body felt like it had electricity running thru it and was surrounded by some kind of energy field. Marg was trying to figure out if the voices we heard were just some kind of echo playing tricks on us. But the singing was on time with me, with no delay, and I could differentiate between a female voice and several other deep male voices.  I played it a total of 5 times. I had to stop because I was shaking so bad, and was also worried about the park cop showing up and giving us a ticket. My body felt like it was being pressurized and running with electricity. I could barely walk. I thanked whoever was out there for singing with me. I was in shock!  I said maybe some people were on top of Devil's Den and their car is parked behind it. We drove around Devil's Den and there were no cars anywhere. We had the whole area to ourselves. This was wednesday, and I still have that feeling 4 days later like I am surrounded by an energy field and something is squeezing my chest. This is freaking me out.  A former pack member of mine lives down in Florida. He's a musician, too.  urlLink http://www.johnnysquest.com/  I sent him one of my poems and he put music to it. It was cool. Well, here's the email that I sent him describing how I came up with another poem, and the poem itself.   John, I'm starting to scare myself. I can't get rid of this weird feeling, like I'm electrified or something. Like there's an energy field surrounding me. This all started when I was singing and playing at Devil's Den and I can't get rid of this feeling. Creepy. Speaking of creepy, I came up with this poem, mixing the experience of that night, along with some civil war stuff and you coming home. You are Johnny, and so is a civil war soldier, (When Johnny comes marching home) You and "Johnny" are yankees who joined (or moved to) the south. Emily was a real rebel female soldier during the civil war. Her family lived up north. She died after being shot in battle. Nobody knows her last name. She asked for someone to deliver a message to her dad to "Forgive your dying Daughter" just before she died. Rock Creek is a creek at Gettysburg where they setup a field hospital in the woods at Rock Creek where many soldiers died. Devil's Den is the haunted place at Gettysburg where I sang with the ghosts "When Johnnie comes marching home". This whole thing is creeping me out. Well, here is.       Coming Home   Johnny when you coming home It's been so long ago Since last time I saw you  Johnny when you coming home Our hometown rebel foe we're still waiting for you  Johnny when you coming home Emily's been shot dead Forgive your dying Daughter  Johnny when you coming home Rock Creek is running red Tainted by the slaughter  Spirits were singing At Devil's Den Wanting to know When you're coming home  Haunted rocks ringing At Devil's Den Echoes of glory For you're coming home  Johnny when you coming home   Well, that about sums up my most recent trip to Gettysburg. I shall return...

      I don't know how men can be such jerks. I hate men. I guess being raised by women and not growing up with a father has something to do with it. Especially after being lied to about his existence. For some reason unbeknownst to me, I was afraid to ask my mom about my dad, and she never talked about him. Ever. I asked my aunts and cousins who he was. My cousins didn't know. One Aunt told me he was a no-good drunk and I didn't want to know him. Another Aunt told me he was dead. I never asked about him again. I always wondered why I didn't have a dad, and was ashamed to tell anyone. Back in the 60's it was taboo to not have a dad. Especially with the Irish Catholics. (My mom stopped taking me to church at an early age for some reason...) I was a secret. It was heartbreaking to see other kids with their dads.  I remember when I was 11 years old, and my Mom and I moved to another relatives house. I ended up making a friend with a kid named Dominic. We became best friends. He was my only friend. One night he started bragging about where his dad worked and telling me about how strong his dad was. He then asked me where my dad worked. I told him I didn't have a dad. This blew him away. His jaw dropped, his eyes nearly popped out of his head, and he said to me, "That means you're a  Bastard!  You're a son of a bitch!" He said he had to go, and never talked to me again. (I believe his family was devout Catholic.) This shocked me. The reality of the situation really started to hit me that night. I was something that people are afraid of. Not having a dad was a lot more serious than I thought. I don't know why he called me a son of a bitch, and I later found out what a bastard was. I never again told any kids I didn't have a father. I lied several times to other kids about my  dad  after that episode.  I found out I was half Italian when I was 16. I managed to lie through school saying I was 100% Irish. I finally asked my Aunt.  When I was 23 my uncle asked me if my mom ever told me who my dad was. (my uncle will be another post; a  big  post) I told him no. He must've said something to my mom and she called me and asked me to meet her. I was shocked to learn that he actually lived about 2 miles from where I grew up (age 11-18), and he had a wife and 4 daughters. Apparently, his wife and daughters didn't know about me.  After I found out, I got really drunk with my friends and went to his house. I knocked on the screen door and his wife was sitting on the chair in the living room. She looked up at me and said "What do you want!" I told her I'm (my mom)'s son, and I'm here to see Joe (my  father ). My father came around the bar, stirring a drink, looking at the door. He had an older couple behind him. He came up to the screen door and we just looked into each other's eyes for what seemed like an eternity. They were  my eyes . I was looking at  my eyes . It was so strange. He finally said, "Can you come back another time? I have company." I said "Sure. I just wanted to stop by and say hello." I turned around and left. Well, I guess I let the cat out of the bag.  I heard his wife divorced him after that. I didn't want that to happen. It just did. Revenge of the bastard son. That was back in 1983. You know he still never tried to contact me. I guess someone will tell me when he dies. I never got the balls to contact my sisters. I don't know them, and I don't know if they know about me. If so, do they hold me responsible for their parents divorce? I don't remember the 4 girls from school. 2 are older than me and 2 are younger than me. I guess I never met them. I am the secret. I am the bastard son.
