      Could you pretend to be someone you were not? Could you keep up the mascarade for long? It can be draining to constantly parade around with that facade up. Who have you pretended to be over the years? The past few months? Today? Are you being the person only you can be? Too many people are so obsessed with what others may find out about them, they remain hidden in a cave of misery in order to appear normal...  Fuck normal. Normal is a setting on your washer, not on you!

      This is the world of the imperial fire hose. Let me tell you about myself: I am a feminist. That's pretty much all you need to know now. I don't take shit from anyone and this is for all the rest of you who are just like me. We all want to be unique, but at the cost of what? Our friends? Our souls? Being unique is different for everyone. Some people are content with their life because they are making a difference, like me. Some people are suicidal becuase they walk around in a miserable fog, like you? God, I hope not. That's the last person I want on this site.  Please - only women who are fed up with the men in the world and are dedicated to making it a place of equal power!

      Do you remember Legally Blonde? In particular when Elle went to the not-so-costume party as a bunny? Good. Now think about the line  Meredith Scott Lynn  (Enid) had during that party about changing the semester to the "Fall Ovester." This is&nbsp;exactly what the world needs. More lines in movies and on TV shows making feminists out to&nbsp;be  psychotic-english-language-changing-bra-burners ! I bring this to your attention because it was brought to mine... by a very obnoxious young tart attempting to explain to me why&nbsp;she&nbsp;thinks feminists need to&nbsp;"get over themselves!" THIS IS WHY FEMINISM POPPED UP&nbsp;IN THE FIRST PLACE! WOMEN HAVE BEEN GETTING OVER THEMSELVES FOR&nbsp;CENTURIES.&nbsp;In the first centruy,&nbsp;women's bodies weren't even considered to be worth the pain of torture and you're going to tell me that I&nbsp;should work&nbsp;the  same job   for less  than a man because&nbsp;I have tits?  I DON'T THINK SO , "HONEY!" I'm not a crazy woman, but&nbsp;I do  respect  myself, which is far more&nbsp;than we can stand around the water cooler and say for you!&nbsp;

      Today is the first day of the rest of my life. I've officially begun another chapter of empowered women. It brings me a great deal of satisfaction to observe these women sharing feelings with one another they have believed for so long were alien. As they experience this they become more aware that increasingly more and more women view the world the same way in which they have been for some time now. My desire is not for all women to become men haters and lesbians. No. My desire is for women to be heard across the nation as a voice of importance, of dedication, of the back bone of this damn Republic!   Don't be misled by others. These groups are not groups of angry women meeting across the southeast vowing to never have sex with a man again, or to overthrow government as we know it. They are meeting to affirm themselves, to affirm a belief system that women do matter, and to affirm thier feelings regarding the way women have been treated for so long. If you are interested in finding a location near you, please email me.

      I know that my girl and I haven't been separated that long, but I've had my eye one someone. It just wasn't the right time for us to be together. But, yes, I've been reading blogs from all over this site. And I've stumbled upon one called The Portable Cafe`. From what I can tell it is a community site for 2-3 women. And one of them, I love to read her stuff. She may eventually find her way here one day and I want her to be aware that I'm a fan. Here's to you, Nic. ;)
