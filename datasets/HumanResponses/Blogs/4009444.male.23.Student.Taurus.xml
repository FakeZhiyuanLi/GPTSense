      The transcript of a drunken voicemail from Swany via Horvie's phone:  "Hoo hoo it's Jonathan - I'm trying to call J.P. the jackass... Williams.  um... This is Swany, me and Horv are coming back from the bar and from eating ... food, because we're both fat.  We beat these old people at darts today, we kicked their ass like...  we played seven games and we beat them like five games to one, because... we're young, studly, and better than them... at darts... and you are in...  Mount  Prospeeeect!   You should... This is your last chance at Iowa State tomorrow, we're leaving at like 6... Of course that's 6 pm, you should come.  Did I say pm or BM? Cause I have to make a BM. And... Fish having sex is cool, so your research paper is cool.  And I have to fart, listen to that (farts into phone). My farts rule."  Keep in mind he is huffing and puffing through the entire thing, which makes it so much more funny.  In case you can't tell, I'm tired of doing the love/hate lists already, so don't expect them.

      Headache.  Won't go away.  I get these headaches every day around 4 pm during the late summer and fall.  I hate it.  Makes me worthless... more so.  Gonna try to put a piece of plexiglass between the door so the cats can see each other and hiss and growl and do whatever stupid cat dominance things they feel like doing without actually touching each other.  Going to have to trim both of their nails so when I get bored and put them together and have a "Kitty Thunderdome" they won't kill each other.  Brazil is being the bully, and weighs 4 lbs more than Sam, but Sam could probably beat the living crap out of Brazil.  He just doesn't have any interest in it.  C'mon Advil, do your magic. :(

      That's all I ever talk about, right?  Well you can bite me.  I picked up Sam this morning, snuck him by Brazil into the bedroom and let him out of the cage.  Brazil had no idea until he started meowing at the door.  Sam escaped through the sliding door a few times; the first time Brazil didn't even notice it seemed, the second time he ran right underneath where she was sitting and hissed, but as soon as I picked him up and threw him back in the other room, it's like she totally forgot he was there.  Maybe this will work out...  Here's the only pictures I could get...  they are no good, but I couldn't get anything better because Sam does not sit still for more than a second.

      Well as far as I can tell, nobody has adopted Sam (the cat that some douchebag gave to the shelter) yet, so I get to pick him up tomorrow morning.  That's good.  In other news:  Love: Coming home Coming home to a cat that is really excited to see you Coming home to a cat that is really excited to see you and wants nothing more than to play, despite the fact the she is too lazy to walk more than a few steps.  Hate: Petco closing at 9, the shelter closing at 7. Sitting next to atrociously fat women on planes. The fat women masking their fat odor with fat lady perfume.  Nasty.

      Not good considering I have to fly back to LA tomorrow.  Oh well.  For some reason I thought of this quote of a quote, from Barney Gumble.  "There's a line in `Othello' about a drinker:  `Now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast.'  That pretty well covers it."  Even better is when he says, "Now they're going to play my movie." Lisa says, " You  made a movie?" Barney replies, " I  made a movie?"

      Nothing like a fake fight to draw attention, or to get kicked out.  The bouncers were yelling at these Mexicans when we were on the way in, saying "I don't need to see your ID, I need to see a green card!"  Horrible, yet funny.  Love: Fake fights Games involving bean bags Eric yakking Calling people on other peoples phones and leaving wretched voicemails  Hate: Losing contacts Forgetting to get your credit card back from your bartab Having to return to the bar the next day with a large tip added to your tab

      ...explained that I wouldn't state the obvious loves and hates in my life, but apparently that went unnoticed by another certain redheaded blogger :)  tisk tisk.  Loves:  White Castle, once per 15 years of life. Eric saying, "Turn down the music, I can't hear myself eat." The gay Mexican calling Eric "Dolomite" and telling him he's cute.   Hates: Bar tabs Fat chicks grinding on each other The guy at the White Castle window being angered by me saying "God Dammit!"

      It's created a hatred that is far too large to keep to myself.  Henceforth, I shall express my love and hate of people (beyond the obvious) and things on any particular day.  Starting now.

      ...time to put weird crap on the internet.  That's what its for, right?  Let's see, since the last time I posted on here, I have gone diving, gone diving, and gone diving.  Today I had to drive our 17' Boston Whaler through some nasty swell to our dive site.  Considering this is only my second time ever driving this boat on the ocean, and first outside the federal breakwall, I'd say I did okay.  Anywho, the swell was so bad that we couldn't even do the shipwreck mapping dive we were supposed to do.  Instead, we did fish counts near the wreck and just a siteseeing dive on the outer breakwall of LA Harbor.  The breakwall was crazy full of stuff.  Note to Kathy: There are tons of  Corynactis  on the breakwall from about 15 ft to 45 ft.  Catalina is a waste of your effort :)  Okay, less jibber jabber, more stupid crap.  Remember when I said I was going to cut my hair, and then I said I cut my hair after a few adult beverages and used the wrong size clipper guard?     I wasn't kidding.  Back to the cats...  Sam is a loud meowing bastard who needs to be all over you at all times of day.  Don't get me wrong, he's a sweetheart - but he makes you lose a lot of sleep.  So Brazil gets the first picture, since she is fat, but doesn't annoy anyone.    Why is she so fat?  Well, tell me how you can look at her when she begs like that and not feed her.  Plus she's a lazy sack of crap, but she's MY lazy sack of crap.  Okay, Sam's turn:    What a weirdo.  Not sure why he needs to have his belly scratched all the time.     Sam doing what cats do best and most people wish they could do.  Let's call this one a 'candid shot'.     If the last one was candid, I don't even know what you'd call this...  Oh wait, its called 'poop'.  "You haven't dealt with women for a looong time, have you, Sergeant?" - Edna K. "Are you asking me out?" - the REAL Principal Skinner

      ...do NOT cut your own hair after drinking.  You may grab the wrong size clipper guard and make yourself look like a leukemia patient. :(  At least I don't have to worry about cutting my hair again for a while.

      That's weird...  oh wait, I still had to go feed the fish in the wetlab at school.  Oh well.  More cat crap:    It looks like they are coexisting quite peacefully...     Until a noise outside makes them both  very wary  of each other, prompting a quick staring contest, followed by a lengthy and loud hiss from Brazil.  It's a  slow  process.  I get to lead the dives tomorrow off the boat at Palos Verdes since I am the resident fish expert in the class and know how to do diving fish transects.  Should be interesting.  There's one broad in the class who owns only one suit, and it's a dry suit.  Note to self:  Dry suits are a pain in the ass, and worthless unless it's below 50 in the water.  She flops around like a dying seal with that thing on - its almost embarassing.  Out of water she looks like a mix between a firefighter and a clown.  Maybe I'll cut my hair tonight, since it's the longest it's been in almost 10 years (a full 1.5-2 inches).  It's pretty rabid looking.  I even bought some spray on sunscreen for my scalp so it doesn't get cooked while I'm out there.  Nothing worse than a burnt scalp.  Judging by the fact that I've put sunscreen (SPF 30) on my face every day during this class and still gotten burned, I'm going to be hurting no matter what I spray on my skull.  Que sera, sera.  "The flow of time is always cruel.  Its speed seems different for each person, but no one can change it.  A thing that does not change with time is a memory of younger days." - yep, another quote from Zelda; they are oddly deep...

      After dropping Kathy off at SCMI to go to Catalina, I stopped by Pacific Wilderness (dive shop in San Pedro) to get a hooded vest, since I hate the skirted hood I have now.  I had an hour to kill before the AAUS class was to meet, but as Murphy's Law predicted, PW was closed.  So I drove to Point Fermin where we were to meet, and I just flipped through the atlas.  I found myself looking at the two pages of North Carolina maps, remembering my time there fondly.  Who knows - maybe I'll be back there someday.  "Time passes, people move. Like a river's flow, it never ends.  A childish mind will turn to noble ambition. Young love will become deep affection. The clear water's surface reflects growth." - believe it or not, from Zelda: Ocarina of Time  "My god its been so long, never dreamed you'd return But now here you are, and here I am..." - Pearl Jam - Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town  "Thas only in tha mo'nin'.

      Day 2 of the AAUS dive class - did some diving in a pool.  I first did that in December of '02, did it again in December of '03 to extend my referral, and now I'm doing it again, most likely (and hopefully) for the last time...  although an 86 degree pool is much nicer to dive in than a 56 degree ocean.  Just not as much cool crap floating around - except for random jimmy hats...j/k.  Ate some lamb coconut curry at Bollywood Cafe across the street on Ventura Blvd.  So now I have to poop.  Later...  "You've all seen the man at the liquor store begging for your change Hair on his face dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange He asked the man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes 'Get a job, you f*@$ing slob' is all he replies."

      Well, first of all, one test I took today was swimming the length of the pool (25 yards) underwater without breathing.  I passed the third time with ease, but the first two times...  Try #1:  I made it about 10-15 ft from the other side and then accidentally kicked the buoy line.  It sorta startled me and I turned and let all my air out.  Oops.  Try #2:  I made it about halfway across when I looked forward and there it was...  Brent's middle finger extended in my direction.  I laughed, and laughing underwater is a bad idea.  After that I felt like vomiting since I didn't eat any breakfast, but I eventually got over it... after swimming 400 yards and treading water for 10 minutes.  "A rose by any other name still smells like a rose." "What if it was called 'crapweed'?" "I would mind a bouquet of crapweed."

      That sucks.  I just got back from 3 days of research in Santa Barbara/Ventura.  Yes, I hurt myself.  No, not badly.  I smashed the knuckle on my middle finger between a metal rail and a plexiglass windshield.  It was super.  Now I spend the next two weeks getting my scientific diver certification.  It's an intense load of diving, doing some crazy stuff that I'm not terribly comfortable with yet... but hey, that's why there's a class for it.  On the last day, we do a dive to about 100 ft and get nice and narced via nitrogen bubbles, then do math problems and see how hard it is.  So I have to do a rediculous swimming test tomorrow morning at 9 in Long Beach.  Did I mention I'm not in shape?  Plus these research trips are exhausting?  :(    Eh, they're sorta getting along.  They brawled when I came home today...  Brazil discovered that Sam can beat her ASS in if he wants to.  "Duuuuuust in the wiiinnnd." - Kansas, The Scorpions, and a bunch of other bands... oh yeah, and Will Ferrell.

      Surprise, surprise.  I've been letting the cats roam around in the living room together.  Maybe a little   Kitty Thunderdome   will solve the problem.  They've been trading sniffs and swipes, and for the most part getting along.  Lots of ass-sniffing, so that has to be good, right?     What a couple of clowns.

      So, if you don't know already, in early June I broke both of my legs, tore my MCL, LCL, and calf muscle courtesy of a research/boating accident.  Research causes damage, since it's tiring, takes a lot of muscle use, and repetitive; sometimes you just fall into a routine... or into a bed of sea urchins, like I did two nights ago.  I was out collecting cryptic fish from tidepools at Resort Point in Palos Verdes Estates, CA, from midnight to about 8 am.  Needless to say, I didn't sleep for over 24 hours, but I'm still not sure how I went from squatting to having about 20 urchin spines in my hand and arm.  I spent about 45 minutes picking them out with a needle and tweezers.  It was great.  Then I went back to work, squatted down to grab more fish, and prompty fell backwards and slid down about 4 feet of rock, urchins, anemones and angry crabs.  At least I was wearing my Gorton's Fisherman gear, so I didn't get soaked when I fell in the tidepool.     Like my yellow bib?  I used to be the balance beam champion of kindergarten at Fairview, too... What happened to me?  (Answer:  I stopped doing things that require activity and I eat too much)  So yes, I'm a clutz, but apparently so is Sam (the new cat).  I'm not sure what the retard did, but he started limping around really hard last night, and still is a bit today.  I hope he just twisted an ankle (pawkle?) and didn't do anything serious, 'cause frankly I'm poor and can't afford vet bills.

      Cubs win, Nomar with an RBI.  That makes my day right there.  So I got an idea from a dude at  caazone.com .  I put a piece of plexiglass in the doorway between the two rooms so the Sam and Brazil can stare each other down but not kill each other.  Seems to be working a bit, we'll see though.     If Brazil weren't so damn fat, it would almost be a mirror image.
