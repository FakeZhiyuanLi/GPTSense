						   Many on the left think that we need to find out why the terrorists hate us so much and find a way to make them like us.  The only way we can make them like us is to convert in mass to their radical version of Islam and subjigate our women like they do.  I don't think even our liberal friends would find that an acceptable solution.  While having 72 virgins for being a martyr sounds like a pretty good deal for a man I don't think the 72 virgins would exactly be thrilled serving 1 man.  Most men I know have a hard time keeping 1 woman happy.  I think the Nevadans found the best way for creating wealth and enterprise in a desert as well as employing people in meaningful jobs.  Build casinos and brothels.  It is just a suggestion.  It is Friday and I have many important things to do so I will make this a short post.  I think the Arab people should brainstorm and come up with better ways of maintaining a culture other then by killing their own people.  Until they do we will come up with ways of making sure they do not kill us.

						   Sean Hannity is calling the Democratic Convention the Reinvention Convention.  I think this is an apt term.  John Kerry has attempted to reinvent himself many times during this election year.  The only reason he would do so is because each previous attempt when people have come to know who he say he is they have rejected him.  He is the typical Democratic candidate of the polls.  He holds his finger in the wind to see how he can get the nomination.  His party has so been taken over by the lunatic left wing fringe so that he went to the left of Howard Dean and Dennis Kuccinich.  At least Mr. Kuccinich has stayed to his roots on the left lunitic fringe.  Mr. Dean has been more pragmatic and endorsed what he considers to be the lesser of two evils.  Thus he has compromised his supposed integrity.  John Kerry has no core values except for the promlugation of his own legacy.   I have met and known many liberals in my lifetime.  They are as a whole a fairly decent sort if misguided.  Though not true in all cases for the most part they do not let facts get in their way when making an argument.  Feelings as a whole are more important to them then truth and reality.  I am a conservative at heart but I am not a conservative koolaid drinker.  I am an independant and realize that the most important part of a society is independance and the individual being responsible for their own success or failure.  In the future I will reveal more and hopefully educate the unwashed masses with what is truth and common sense.  Until then God Bless the United States of America and I will remain a devout follower of the greatest president of my lifetime, Ronald Wilson Reagan.  God bless all (and yes there is a God)

						   I am new to the blog world.&nbsp; I am setting this up now.&nbsp; I feel that this election is a turning point in this countries history.&nbsp; John Kerry is the most disengenuous candidate I have seen to date.&nbsp; This blog will not be just about this election but about my thoughts on many issues.&nbsp; I will post this now and hopefully set up this blog so that others will be able to make use of my intellect.&nbsp;

						   I guess when I started this blog it was with the hope that I would attract a great many people to it and share my wisdom and intellect with them.  I have come to the conclusion that I am am not entertaining enough to attract a big following.  I will still continue to post.  At least it gives me an outlet to share my feelings.  Perhaps I can educate a few people with my writings.  I want to share some of my thoughts about the people on the right and left of this country.  I don't think you can really put people in a particular bucket.  We are still a country of individuals and I thank God for that.  That said I will make the following generalizations:  The people on the right tend to be more acute to the importance of the individual.  They feel that each person is responsible for their success or failure and is accountable for each.  The people on the left tend to look at fairness and how society should be reponsible for each person and their environment.  This is a noble thought.  The problem with this is that their solution for society's problems tends to be taking money from the more successful and giving it to the less fortunate.  However you look at this it boils down to stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.  I do not want to live in a Robin Hood society.  It may sound callous but if a person can not succeed in life then they are deserving of the fruits of their endeavors.  Many people look at the conservative movement and call them the far right.  This is misleading and disengenous.  The people on the far left today use the most despicable of tactics and are the sorriest bunch of people I know.   A person should be responsible for their success or failure in this country and accountable for their actions.  I realize that in real life their are still things we need to work on.  As far as feminism goes their is not a glass ceiling but their is a glass obstacle.  This can not be fixed by legislation but must be changed within societal workings.  Their is still racism in this country.  Once again this will not be fixed by legislation.  Racism will only recede as older generations die off and take with them their bigotry.  Fringe groups are not helping but are only exacerbating the problem and ostracise otherwise good people.  If you really wish to make a positive change in this country abandon the socialist Democratic party and start a party that is a true alternative to the Republican party.  Until this happens vote Republican.  If you vote otherwise you are an idiot.  I hopes this helps give you a better understanding.

						   Hi there.  How many days until the election?  I think today I will speak about taxes and how I think they should apply.  Today I cosigned with my son on his house.  I speak of this to show how parental involvement in our children is important.  I divorced my wife when my son was 10 years old.  We have a good relationship even though we are no longer married.  After 12 years she could no longer put up with me but the two of us realized the responsibility we had with my son.  My ex is a good woman and I thank God for that.  She recoginized as well as did I that because we had a son that our responsibility was in raising him.  Too many people in this country are selfish and worry about their own self interests and forget about the children.  My son was my responsibility and I did not want to confuse him so for the past 10 years I have forsaken haven a girlfriend so I could concentrate on raising my son.  My ex did the same.  For this I have the utmost respect for my ex wife.  I thank God that she votes for conservatives and has the same contempt for the lunatic left wing democratic party.  When you make a committment and have children you must commit to seeing that they are raised correctly.   Now I can go on with my life and pursue another relationship.  I will do so but will always be their for my son.  I hope this helps you understand where I am coming from.  George W. Bush has my vote.   I hope he has yours.  God bless the United States of America.

						   So I have listened to the political chatter of the day.  The most significant news is that President Bush has proposed realigning our troops throughout the world.   He has proposed bringing home some of our boys and girls in Germany, Japan, and South Korea.  Let's look at Germany:  The main reason for having a force in Germany was to stabilize the country and restrain the threat from the Soviet Union.  Let's recap.  Germany is a democracy and our ally in NATO.  The cold war is over and Russia is now one of our allies albeit with a ways to go to being a true friend.  Japan is one of our strongest allies in the Pacific and an important economic partner.  North Korea has been reduced to being a laughingstock and is waiting to economically implode.  Our democratic "friends" here at home have long lambasted the conservatives and said that we should bring our troops home.  I personally don't think they give a damn about our troops and only with to see their socialistic agenda realized.  The truth of this has been realized now that President Bush has proposed that we bring these troops home and the lunatic left attacks him for unilaterialism.  This proves that their only objective is to return to power,  decieve the American people what their true intent is, and turn over American sovergienty to the Useless United Nations.  The Hollowood elite along with our Socialist leaders (The leadership of the Democratic party) wish to confuse the American people.  They prostitute themselves to appeal to the poor of this country and say to them that although you will always be poor we will look out for you.  They say to the poor of this country that you have no chance but we the caring elite will make sure you have bread and health care.  They are liars.  This country offers opportunity for all those who will reach out and grab it.  If you are lazy and a neer do well then you deserve to be shunned.  A society can only exist successfully if their people are willing to do the work necessary to sustain it.  If you are capable of adding to society but are too lazy to do what is necessary to support it then why should we support you.   Safety nets should be in place for those that try their hardest but can not make it in a society.  Safety nets should only be there for those that try but still need our help.  Work your hardest to be a productive member of society.  If you do and still fail I can promise you that the American people will do their best to make sure that you have every chance to succeed.   This philosophy is foreign to today's Democratic party.  If you vote Democrat in today's world you are either ignorant, on the wrong side of American values, or evil.  Take your choice.  I see it no either way.  God bless you and God bless the best country in the world, The United States of America.

						   Time for another post.  If you have not figured it out yet I am encouraging all those who are not completed retarded to vote for the Republican ticket.  If you vote Democrat you are most certainly a moron.  Voting Republican at this time shows that you are for individual responsibility and wish to make your own way in life.  Voting Democrat shows that you are unsure of yourself and wish someone else to be in charge of your life.  Voting Democrat is akin to endorsing serfdom.  This shows that you are weak and a wimp.  How many wimps do we have in this country?  I can count them by the number of idiots in this country that vote for the Democratic ticket.  Europe is such a waste of human idiocy.  France is the country that is by far the most weak and despicable I have seen.  If you wish to be more like France then you are a weak despicable idiot.   The Mulim people who have such a moronic culture wish you to be more like the French.  I ask the American people,  who do you wish to emulate, a wimpish people like the French, or a strong people who are individualistic and repsonsible for their fate?  You decide.

						   I had asked acceptance in the blogosphere from such blogs as I respected and enjoyed.  I guess I have not done enough to realize their acceptance by accolades.  I guess this it appropriate.  I must put in my time.  When I realize the acceptance of Rachel Lucas, Frank J, and the nice doggie by blog life will fee more complete.  Until then I will continue to educate the unwashed masses with the truth.   On taxes,  We need a national sales tax.  A flat tax would be better than what we have today but is insufficient.  The income tax needs to be repealed and made unconstituional.  We need to spend less time on drugs and vice and more on such serious crimes as murders and armed robbery.  Prostitution should be legalized.  Men and women will offer there services regardless of the law.  We would be better served regulating and taxing it rather than prosecuting it.   I am a religous man but religion and law do not mix well.  We should not be putting people in jail for pleaures of the flesh.  Fines are appropriate but not jail time.  I feel that if prostitution were somewhat legalized we would have less instances or rape.  Like it or not if a guy can legally get laid by a nice looking female we would have less instances of rape.  I am not excusing rape,  I am just saying that if a woman is in that line of work it is better that she get paid for it and have health benefits.  We need to get real.  In this aspect for once our liberal friends are correct.  Our Hollowood "freinds in this aspcet are on the money/  The femimazi's are not.  I have not even heard them object to the treatmeant of Arab women by the backward culture that many Arab people espouse/  They are hypocrites.  They can n0t even seriously condemn our so called friends. I call myself an indepenant.  In truth I am a Regean Republican.  I have not joined the party.  I will continue to vote Rebublican because I have been given an alternative.  As long as the Democratic party continues down their socialist path I do not have a choice.  I realize that my intellect would make me the logical choice for an alternative but I made many bad decisons in my youth that would come back to haunt me.  So until an alternative presents itself I will continue to support the Republican party.  I ask you to vote Rebublican until I am able to provide an alternative to the Socialist Democratic party of today.

						   Hi there friends and neighbors.  I brag about how you must come to me to get the truth.  Our "democratic" friends are causing it to be so that you can go anywhere in the conservative part of the blogosphere and you will see so clearly that you do not need my great wisdom.  Even so I must comment.  Our Vietnam swift boat veterans have exposed John F'ing Kerry for the lying punk that he is.  While not amazing it is with continuing wonderment that the left wing national media of our country continues to ignore this most important story.  J F Kerry said he was in Cambodia on Christmas Eve in 1968.  He has proven to be a liar.  He betrayed our troops and has proven to be a liar.  This is not news to CBS, NBC, ABC, NPR, or any other socialist media source.  Thank God for the blogosphere, Fox news, and talk radio.  It is shameful that the mainstream media would put there own political beliefs before responsible jounalism.  If this is not proof that our mainsteam media and the Democratic party have not come so far towards socialism I do not know what it will it take before the average American realizes how destructive our so called "Democratic" party has come.  We have a two party system.  The Republican party which represents big business and the socialist "Democratic" party.  There is no party representing mainstream America.  We have a choice between a party (the Democratic party) that has sold us out and the Republican party which represents big business but has not sold us out.  The choice is clear but not the best.  Anyone in my mind who votes for the Democrats is either an idiot, ignorant or is so insecure that they would rather have a state run government to take care of them.  I admire George W. Bush.  I do not agree with all his ideas but I respect the fact that he speaks his mind,  has our best interests at heart, and honestly tries to make this country and world a better place.  After the election I just hope that he will take steps to do away with the income tax and return this country to its roots.  If you do not understand what I am trying to get at or where I am coming from I would be most happy to educate you.  God bless you all and God bless the best country on the face of the earth, The United States of America.

						   I will try this post again.  For those of you who are more than stupid I will explain the American posiition.  If you ever attempt to invade Israel or their people we will crush you.  This is a fact and non-negatiable.   Viet Nam was not a mistake for most of us.  The hippies and neer-do-wells of this country have received a free ride due to our form of government.  We welcome free speech.  Our left wing "friends do not".  If the Arab  people of this time continuse to be such stupid assholes then we will continue to treat them as the most stupid people as they deverve.  If you want to understand what the best route is you will ask me.  Otherwise you will continue to ask people less understanding then myself what we should do?

						   I thought I heard something on the radio yesterday morning and got all excited.   Since then I have not heard a word about it.   What I heard was that the republicans were thinking about putting in their platform to do away with the IRS and the income tax.  Since I can find nothing else about it I must have been caffiene deprived and not quite coherent.  One can always dream.  I think this would be the perfect time for such a proposal.  For all it's worth you have my wholehearted support.  If you had a National Sales Tax then everyone would truly pay their fair share and would no longer have income tax welfare in the form of the earned income credit.  Only a Democrat could come up with a way for a person to get a refund when they paid no taxes.  If anyone hears any more about this please let me know.

						   Now we are being told that John Kerry is an avid hunter and fisherman.  I guess next we will discover is that he is a card carrying member of the NRA.  You would think that terrorist organizations such as Greenpeace and PETA would be completely distraught and up in arms.  I don't think we will hear narry a peep out of them.  They know this for the farce that it is.  This man will say or do anything to get elected.  Once again I must remind you that as far as liberals are concerned lying is okay if it is for a greater good.  I have not checked his voting record but I would be surprised if he has ever voted against gun control.  I will leave that to my good friends in talk radio to investigate.  He is also now espousing his faith in God.  I wonder what his voting record is when it comes to appointing judges who have religious beliefs.  I think we all know.

						   To date 32 of you have taken the time to realize that if you want truth and understanding you must come through me.  I have heard many recent diatribes on the good or ill of globalization.  If you believe that protecting jobs here is a good thing then you or a moron.  The theory of economics is really a very simple one.  If people in other countries have more money to spend then we will be better off as a country.  Protectionism provides a short term positive economic boost to any economy.  If it is truly important to you that your children and grandchildren are better off than you are then you will reject a protective perspective.  Poetry is such fun.  As third world countries come to enjoy the idea of having disposable income Socialism will fade into the scrapheaps of history where it belongs.  We can bemoan the loss of jobs overseas or we can celebrate the decline of despicable dictatorships and creeping socialism.  The choice is yours.  If you have any doubts what is the right choice is then come to the best place for obtaining truth and wisom.  Me.
