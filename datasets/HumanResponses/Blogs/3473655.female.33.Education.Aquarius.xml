      Today is our last full day of school.  Us teachers are just as anxious as the students to get this next week over with.  I still have to make my exams, though... Last night I had to meet with my sponsor (I am an alcoholic thankyouverymuch) and had a very good meeting after it.  As I was driving home, I couldn't help but think of my ex and how he is drinking, constantly, it seems.  He hangs out at Hooters (yes, he is white trash!), biker bars, and rents videos from porno shops.  His problems are deepening.  I am so glad I am now on the outside, not a part of it.  When I think to the sick last months we were together, and the strange stuff he was doing, I realize now that the majority of things going wrong were him.  I hadn't been kissed for weeks.  Sex was something that came about after weird stuff happened....drugs, porn videos, whatever.  After three years together, things are supposed to get better.  Comfortable.  Sane.  But it just got more and more insane, and I am glad he flipped out that last day and I'm glad he moved out.  I am happy to be single.  I am LOVING it!  I have done so many good things for myself these past two weeks.  I feel great getting up in the morning.  I am busy.  There are lonely times, but then again, I had worse lonely times when he was there.

      This begins the story of how I got to where I am today.  Happy, sober, and in a relationship so full of promise I could cry.  If I weren't on Paxil! All the major men in my life have been broke, uneducated, with no ambition to be anything.  They had no eye for the future.  Issues grew as fast as my waistline did.  I was completely unhappy with my ex-husband.  I had left him for a younger man...he was 21 years old when we met.  I got so sucked into the party scene, one I had grown tired of so many years before.  At 30, it definitely seemed like a mid-life crisis.  I was staying up until well past midnight, even though I had to get up at 5am for my one-hour commute to work the next day.  I was teaching Middle School Spanish, and I didn't care about how irresponsible I had become.  I was in lust.  I was having unbelievable sex with someone 9 years younger than me.  I was drinking heavily.  I had stopped going to yoga classe because they interfered with the party life I had just come into.  I knew, with the family history of alcoholism, that it was a possibility I might develop a problem.   I remember being at school, teaching on September 11 2001.  We had been watching everything all day long.  It was an exhausting day and I just wanted to go home and be with my boyfriend.  What I found was beyond what I could handle that day.  It was about 3pm, and as I walked into the house, a heavy cologne smell came over me.  I hate cologne, and didn't even have any in the house.  I walked upstairs to find my boyfriend had spent the day drinking at the bars with his "friends".  That's what he called all the losers he knew at the bars.  Nevermind that he didn't *know* them.  They were barflies and he thought they were his friends because they shared a common interest: becoming as blasted as Hell as the drop of a hat.  He had gotten wasted at noon and tried to cover it up with the cologne.  The bedroom reeked of booze.  I was crestfallen.  Wasn't my day difficult, too?  I had no inkling to go drinking, even though I am sure many people around the country were doing just that.  It was traumatic for everyone.  Then I got the phone call.  The news back home had read off the name of one of my best friends from High School.  We knew she was in one of the buildings, in NYC for business.  I wouldn't leave the house, for fear I would miss really important news.  Luckily, just a couple hours later, I found out she had made it out alive.   We had rented a house together an hour from where we first met.  I was snowed into thinking that a location change would make our relationship stronger.  Hell, I was glad to get him out of that small town, away from his "friends" so we could begin a peaceful relationship.   What a fucking stupid loser I was!  He got a job bartending at a really nice restaurant, and wouldn't make it home until 1am some nights.  This really didn't work for me.  I needed a good night's sleep to be able to teach, but he refused to find a day job.  Within a couple weeks, I was finding phone numbers of other girls in his pockets.  His stories were so outrageous, I can't believe I fell for them.  I made him move out, but he had forgotten his phone book.  As I looked through it, I was finding random names of girls...written recently...on every page.  Some were written on cocktail napkins, some on scraps of paper that fell out as I opened the book.  I was so angry and hurt, I cried for hours.  I called some of them.  I needed to know if he had cheated on me...the age of AIDS and all.  Luckily, none of them even remembered him.  In his sick and twisted mind, he thought this made him a bigger man.  Getting a phone number.  I actually did get a hold of a girl who invited me to her salon to meet her.  She didn't remember his face.  She was with friends drinking after a funeral.  He had said he was single and gotten her number.  I know he called it, because it showed up on my phone bill.  He had called her a few times, but she wasn't home.  I had no ill feelings toward her.  She thought he was single, but never even spoke to him.  Maybe it made him feel more attractive or something.  Who knows.   I decided to give him one last chance.  I know, what a loser I was!  I made a decision to move from Upstate NY to Phoenix.  My best friend from High School lived there, and she was a stand-up comic.  She had told me for years I should do it, and I thought "What the Hell, what else have I got to lose?"  So, I told him I was moving and gave him the option of going with me.  He said yes.  We rented a nice apartment and got jobs.  He got home earlier than me, but sometimes worked the night shift.  He had no car, just a skateboard.  I often stayed up late to pick him up from work.  Sucker.  I found out later that while I was working, he would go to tittie bars on his days off, always making it home before me.  I am a very good looking woman, secure, educated.  We had an amazing sex life.  What the fuck was drawing him to some dark, dank hole-in-the-wall?  I had given him the chance to start a new life with me.  What the fuck more could I give? After a year, we bought a house together.  We had a blast decorating it.  Unfortunately, his drinking picked up again.  I followed along.  We had no friends, just each other.  All we did was drink after work.  We painted our new place, completely hungover from the night before.  We finally moved in, and the drinking continued.  My father had died a few months previously.  He was an alcoholic and I always swore the disease wouldn't get me.  It did.  It caught up with me FAST.  `I was gaining weight, not wanting to spend money to go the movies even, because that would take away from drinking money.  I got a great new job teaching, only to go in hungover, sometimes still drunk.  It was insane.  We would close the bars on weekends, buy more booze, and drink until we passed out.  New Year's Eve showed itself to me as the begniing of the end.  We invited the bar back home.  Here in Phoenix, bars close at 1am.  Hardly a time to stop partying on New Year's Eve!  We had a good time with our guests.  There was a guy there my boyfriend's age.  He invited him up for a 3some.  I had never done that before, but we were always into trying new things in the bedroom, so I didn't think much of it.  It was his idea, anyway.  Besides, it was me and 2 guys.  A bit strange, as most couples invite another woman into the bedroom for fun.  The other guy had a bit of "trouble" performing.  I looked up to see my boyfriend with the guy's dick in his mouth, trying to get him aroused.  Now, I am not sure many men would do that, no matter how drunk.  And I suddenly remembered a part we had been to almost 3 years before.  MY best friend was gay and had a bunch of friends over.  There were straight and gay people there.  It was a great party, until I "lost" my boyfriend.  I found him...and a room with a total flamer, with the door closed.  Both were fully dressed, but I could tell I walked in on SOMETHING.  Flash back to New Year's 3some.  Guy still couldn't get it up, boyfriend used his hands and mouth on the guy.  He eventually went home.  Showed up the next day saying he "had 20 minutes to kill".  I didn't fall for it.  I was hungover, making food.  The guy ended up coming by sometimes 5 times a day.  Found out a few days later that he was "mentally challenged"!  I had had a 3some with a RETARD!!!!  I laughed hysterically.  I also didn't let my boyfriend forget the fact that HE was the one who tried the hardest to get things going.  He blamed it on drinking.  WHATEVER. Friday the 13th of February...2004...we went out drinking at the corner bar.  Got trashed.  I ended up kissing some random guy.  Who knows why.  Maybe I knew things weren't good with us, maybe I was just so wasted.  I can't make excuses about it.  We went home and got into a huge fight.  He threw things.  Pushed me.  Spit water into my face.  I got really scared and tried to dial 911.  He pulled the phone out of the wall.  I tried using his cell phone.  He took it from me.  One of my attempts must have gone through, because a bit later there was a knock at the door.  I explained to the cops that he had hit me and spit in my face.  They took him outside and questioned him.  They came back in, told me to turn around, and slapped the cuffs on.  I guess since I ad pushed him back in self-defense, I was also being taken in for assault.  I waited in the back of the cop car for the paddy wagon.  I was completely shocked that I was in this position.  I was a teacher, damnit!  I was trying to defend myself!  We arrived at the jail downtown, went through booking and everything.  I was still drunk, still shocked.  It was a nightmare.  I had my period and had to take my tampon out in front of 2 male cops.  It was totally humiliating.  They needed to make sure I had nothing "up there".  Like I had time to think about that!   We spent almost 24 hours in our cells.  I was in a room with at least 15 other women.  I thought I was so much better than them, a professional who just had a bad night.  What an ass.  How can I be better than them, when we were in the same place?  I made the best of it.  Actually had alot of fun.  We joked around, slept (tried to, I should say).  I finally got out, took a cab home, and tried to lay down for a bit.  He called about an hour later, just got released.  I went and picked him up and we cleaned up the house a bit before crashing into bed.  The next few days were a blur...will write those later.
