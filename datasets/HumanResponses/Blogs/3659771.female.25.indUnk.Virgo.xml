      God please give me strength. I dont know how i knew, i just *knew*. i knew he was lying to me about his "meeting" and i knew he was lying about why he borrowed the money from de and i knew he was lying about where he went. I dont know why but something told me to look in the trashcan and thats when i found it. I CANNOT handle this shit again. i can't go through this. EVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME he says he wont lie to me anymore and he just does it over and over and over and over again. i dont think he will ever stop. i know i should just leave him but i dont have the strength. and i have no where to go. i just dont know what to fucking do. it makes me think that if i am right about these drug feelings then the cheating on me feelings might be right too. he went to his brothers (he at least had the decency to call and say where he went after he screamed "fuck you" and gave me the finger before he drove off) and i told him to come home and i dont know what to do. he should come home on his hands an knees begging for my forgivness. but he wont. i bet he wont even say he is sorry. HE LIED TO ME TO MY FACE FOR THE THOUSANDTH FUCKING TIME AND HE HAS THE AUDACITY TO BE MAD AT *ME*. he is so fucked up. I thought yesterdy went so well and i was beginning to really be a little bit happy and then he pulls this SHIT on me once again. i dont know what to fucking do. i wish i could punch him in the fucking face.  i wish i could pull his heart out of his fucking chest and stomp all over it. i want him to feel every bit of the agonizing pain he has put me through for 2 and half years. why cant see what he is doing?? why cant he see how much he is hurting me and the kids?? why does he do it over and over and over again??  i dont knw what i should when he gets home. i dont know what to say. he is so fucked up he tries to turn everything around on me and say everything is my fault. he lies to my face and does things behind my back repeatedly YET SOMEHOW IT IS ALL *MY* FUCKING FAULT. all i have eever don ei love him with all my heart. that i sll i have ever done and he continues to treat me like

      well the weekend wasn't so great. we went to the reunion on friday and that was fine. but on sat it was not fine. d hit a squirrel on the way up and i was very upset. i probably shouldn't have said some things that i said but he definitely SHOULDN'T have told me to "shut the fuck up". i tried to get him to give me the keys so i could leave but he refused.he also refused to apologize as if that was an acceptable way to speak to your wife. then he threw one of his little baby temper tantrums. so i sat in the car and sobbed for an hour before he finally realized i was in even in there. then the rest of the day he kept wandering away from me and he refused to sit tby me the entire day. i would be sitting there on a bench by myself and he see me and walk over and sit on another bench. i have no idea why he does such messed up things like that. for the past 3 nights, i have been hinting that i want to do it, and of course i get no response. both the kids were sleeping yesterday and i sat there in my underwear after i got out of the shower and NOTHING. he didn't even notice. he barely even looked over at me.  i  cannot stand being rejected over and over and over again. i just feel like the biggest ugliest most pathetic loser on the planet.  i cant just sit around and wait for him to notice me. it is killing me. i cry every day and it is always the same. i know he will come home from work today, make a point that he is SO tired. he will lie down on the bed and watch TV and i will sit there just waitiing for him to talk to me or even look at me. he will go sleep and i will hug and kiss him and he will just say goodnight and rollover and i will be all alone lying there. i am so lonely, i don't know what to do. he will never grab me and kiss me. he will never pull me over to him so he can hold me. i will just lay there alone on the bed for the rest of my life.

      well today has been better. d didn't go to work because he wasn't feeling well. we were lying in bed and i started crying and told him how frustrated i was. i told him i try so hard and it doesn't seem to make a diffrence. i don't know if he just felt sorry for me or what but we did end up doing it. he did initiate it but in a not so great way. i guess in my situation, you can't take what you can get. it was kind of rushed because the kids could have come in at any moment but it wasn't too bad. he has been lying in bed  all day since then. i know he said he didn't feel well but part of me can't help but be suspicious that he is taking something again. i guess i will just have to wait and see.  the kids have bad sunburns from yesterday so they stayed inside all day and drove me crazy. they are so cute though and i love them so much. so i don't know where it goes from here. i guess we are kind of just waiting until we go to counseling. i am going to try and not cry and complain all the time, i think that was just making it worse. I am not going to pretend to be completely happy either though. i have been feeling the baby more and more and the kicking is getting stronger. i am still worried but the us is soon and then we will know if everything is ok and if it is another little boy or girl. i can't wait.

      bedtime is is the worst time of day for me. i even broke more rules. i layed there with just my lace unders on hoping just hoping for a little spark. nothing. i went even further and scratched his back and touched his arm. i even spooned him from behind and all i got was good night kiss and lecture on how bad his head hurt. i swear his does this on purpose. it is like he thinks "l might want to have sex with me tonight so i need to make a point to tell her how sick/tired i am so she will leave me alone" it just makes me feel like shit. EVERY night its another excuse. i will be waiting for years at this rate. i just don't know if i can do it. i am trying really really hard not to cry. he is never gonna do it. he is never gonna grab me and kiss me and touch me. he never will. this sadness is so deep and so painful i don't think it will ever go away.

      i don't know if i will ever be happy. i don't think he will ever change and i don't think i will ever get used to my life being this way. i broke my rules today and climbed over to him on the bed and kissed him. why do i keep trying and trying. why is is so hard for me not to touch him but it is so easy for him not to come near me.the guy on the blog that is a mirror refection of my feelings seems to have alot of fantasies about other people. the sad thing is, almost every single one of my fantasies are about my very own husband. how sad and pathetic is that?? I have to fantasize about my OWN husband. I even attempted to try and make him a little excited today by shaving off almost all of my body hair from the waist down and telling him about it. no response. stupid stupid STUPID me. I have to learn that NOTHING i do excites him or turns him on in anyway. it is hard to get used to. everytime i think about it i just want to burst into tears and cry until my eyes run dry. my heart is so heavy. sometimes i think he thinks my pain is almost a joke and i think he mocking me or taunting me. that is the worst hurt in the world to have someone make light of your pain. he keeps promising me he will write down his feelings because when i try to talk he pretty much says nothing like his head is just empty of thoughts and he totally devoid of any feelings. he still hasn't done it.

      the good husband made a really good post today. i think i need to calm down and not make myself so upset. i do believe him when he says he loves me. we just need to work things out. of course it does make me very sad to think i will go my whole life and no one will ever do those things that posted in an earlier entry. this is only day 3 and already it has been very hard. i don't want to live like this. i don't want to be in a marriage like this, where i do all the work. i hate to just wait and wait and wait. i wish i could just fall asleep instantly every night instead of jut lying there alone, waiting. i hate that more then anything.

      another horrible miserable day. i thought he didnt know all those things. i thought he didn't know. but he has known all along and he never did ANYTHING. i lie next to him in bed every night and he NEVER DOES ANYTHING. i must be the ugliest most pathetic loser on the planet. he says i do turn him on. then why has he been TOO FUCKING TIRED for the past 2 and half years?? why does he NEVER initiate sex?? i am just so upset. i just want to crawl out of my skin and be someone else. i can't take this anymore. i can't live like this. it is killing me. i can't cry every day. i can't walk around with a broken heart anymore.

      i hate myself. so much. the kids are sleeping and he just says nothing about what i wrote, even when i ask. i just lie their and i know he doens't want to do it and it just kills me. it just rips my heart right out of my chest and i just want to die. why isn't he attracted to me. why doesn't he have sexual feelings towards me at all. he has so many oppurtunities and he just does nothing. NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING. i am such a fool. such a stupid pathetic fool. i wanted to jump on him so badly, i just wanted to grab him and kiss him. but i didn't because i wanted to wait and see what he would do. of course HE DID NOTHING what the fuck is wrong with me.  i can't even cry because he will yell at me and throw one of his baby temper tantrums. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME??????????? i am just too ugly or fat or am I just bad in bed or is there someone else?? I will never ever  fucking know because he refuses to even have the decency to tell me why he won't ever have sex with me. why he never ever ever initiates it. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME????? I can't go downstairs. i can't lay next to him. it tears me aprt and i just want to scream. i don't know what to do. i don't know what to do. i don't knowhat to do.

      i am so stupid. i actually thought it would have an effect and it didn't do a thing. he told me he would tell me what he thought and now he is downstairs playing the ps2. being very loud and annoying and immature. i HATE when he gets like this. i swear he has multiple personality disorder. or it could be that he taking something and i am jsut too stupid to catch on. just like i thought maybe my words would have some effect. i just keep hoping and hoping and nothing ever changes. i guess i will just go back to ignoring him. What else can i do? i spelled it out for him and he didn't do a thing. or he just doesn't care. i guess i will just lie down and go to sleep and tomorrow will be the same fucking thing over and over and over again.

      i really dont want this to seem like it is all about sex. its not. i love my husband very much. more then he will ever know.  i feel like we have drifted apart so far and there is no closeness anymore. sex is important but it is past that point.  it is the lack of intimacy and affection, that we once shared, that is lost. and i can't help mourn for this loss.  it kills me that he can't even talk to anymore. i really have no idea how he feels about anything. i really hope that counseling will help us through this and not  shut us off from each other even more. i love him so much and i love our kids and i want us to be a family.

      i guess the part that hurts the most is that i don't turn him on. he can't just look at me and forget about being tired. i can even touch him and i will still get almost no response. hell, i even crawled on him naked and get nothing. it really hurts that he doesn't think i am hot, that i dont make him hard, that he doesnt get excited by me. it really hurts to think he was to look at girls on the internet to get excited but he doesn't feel a thing for me. so many things about him turn me on. i love his arms, his lips, his eyes. i just look at him and think about how i want him to throw me up againt the wall and do me right then. but i know he doesn't feel that way about me. i feel like i have tried so many things to get him interested, i shaved my pubic hair, i dress up in VS underwear and he still doesn't care. i just don't know what to do anymore. just give up i guess

      or this morning i should say. i had a sex dream about ex-boyfriend chris which is pretty funny because he is the last person in the world you would think to have a sex dream about. Especially since it hardly ever got to that point. it was actually a really good dream though. very tender and sweet. i have decided i am going to break my rules and tell d that the next time we have sex i will do anything he wants. anything. i bet you a million dollars he will respond with a "k" and that will be it. I kissed him extra hard today before he went to work and tried to pull him close but i dont think he noticed. i really really wish he would just grab me and kiss me hard and pull my clothes off. i know it is just wishful thinking though it is a nice fantasy i guess. i really like when he initiates sex, i really really like when he takes my clothes off instead of me, and i would really really love if he would touch my face while we are kissing. i would love to just make out with him, just kiss and kiss, but he never seems interested. i tried to see if he wanted to do it standing up, with me in the front bending over so he could grab my boobs, the last time we did it but once again he was not interested. i guess its the shower and my stupid fantasies again, just like every day.

      even after all i told him today, he still came home from work and didn't even say hello. not even a glance. he just ate and went straight downstairs to watch tv. nothing. not a touch not a glance not even a simple hello, just nothing. it is so hard not to be upset. even after everything i said, he doesn't even try. not one single tiny little effort. i want to cry. but he will just yell at me and say he didn't do anything. thats the point. you don't do ANYTHING. why does he even bother to say he loves me when his actions are those of a stranger. i am just invisible and i always will be.

      i dont think it is working. i still feel terrible today. i think i have decided to just ignore him. i will treat him exactly the way that he treats me. it will be hard not to be touched. even if i am the one doing everything,  at least it was something. now there will be nothing.  i found a big snail outside today.

      i think i am been going about this all wrong. obviously what i am feeling now is not working. i need to focus on myself. i need to find the reasons in myself why i am a good wife and a good person. even though i love him more then anything in the world, i can't base my happiness on him. it will be hard to  not get upset when he doesn't pay attention to me or when he looks at girls on the internet. it will be hard but i can't let it affect like i have been doing. it is tearing me apart. i need to do my own thing. go out by myself. i can't wait around for him anymore. if he is never going to change then i need to change. of course that scares me because i am always afraid he is looking for someone else. i know i haven't always felt like that, i wonder if it was because of him or because i lost myself that i started feeling like this. i am scared that if we move to oregon or washington, he find a pretty interesting punk rock girl and forget all about me. and all that i went through and all that i fought for will just be lost. i guess i shouldn't stress myself out over things that haven't happenned or by things that could happen. i need to focus on right now and not make myself so upset. i always thought that you could truly tell when you were in love with someone because their happiness was more important then your own. that is certainly true for me but what about him? i don't think i will ever know.

      i hate how normal things are such a chore for him. you would think you wouldnt have to ASK somone to touch thier own wife. he acts like it is such a burdon to even sit by me, like he has to make some great effort. touching somone you love comes naturally. why doesn't he want to touch me? am i really that ugly and horrible that he can't stand even being close to me? he doesn't even look at me, i am that awful. is is such a terrible feeling, and i don't think that the sadness from it will ever go away.

      If I go back and read my entries, I sound like a horrible depressed loser. maybe I am but there is more to me then that, though it doesn't seem like it.  I guess it is hard for me to write things down when I am happy. but it has been such a bad few years that i can hardly think of when i was last truely happy.  I guess i should be happy about the baby and sometimes I am but most of the time i think that this baby will just have terrible life. i can't stop worrying about money and bills. and of course i always worry that there is something wrong with the baby. hopefully i will feel better after the u/s. only 3 more weeks.   (i guess it hurts me so bad that you are going out of your way to help, because i know you would never ever do that that for me. i am just not that important)

      most of the time I still feel like a little kid. I thought by 25 years old i would feel like an adult. especially since i have children of my own. i remember in my eyes were watching god when janie after all she had been through, suddenly realized herself and became a full person. will that ever happen to me? self-actualization-is it just an unrealistic dream? does it even exsist? i don't anyone who feels like like. or maybe everyone does.

      somedays are just SO bad. I get so lonely and my heart is just broken. I know it is just me. I crawl on top of him and I get nothing. But I know if miss bikini did the same there wouldn't be a problem.  It is just me. fat ugly pathetic me.  he just ignores me when I cry. he doesn't care enough about me to get mad, I am so stupid. He doesn't care enough about me to have any sort of feeling. I think he knows no one would ever be interested in me, that is why he shows no jealously. he just doesn't care enough. even if he knew how lonely and deperate for affection i was, he still wouldn't care. it is the worst feeling in the world.

       Elm   by Sylvia Plath   For Ruth Fainlight  I know the bottom, she says. I know it with my great tap root: It is what you fear. I do not fear it: I have been there.  Is it the sea you hear in me, Its dissatisfactions? Or the voice of nothing, that was your madness?  Love is a shadow. How you lie and cry after it Listen: these are its hooves: it has gone off, like a horse.  All night I shall gallop thus, impetuously, Till your head is a stone, your pillow a little turf, Echoing, echoing.  Or shall I bring you the sound of poisons? This is rain now, this big hush. And this is the fruit of it: tin-white, like arsenic.  I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets. Scorched to the root My red filaments burn and stand, a hand of wires.  Now I break up in pieces that fly about like clubs. A wind of such violence Will tolerate no bystanding: I must shriek.  The moon, also, is merciless: she would drag me Cruelly, being barren. Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have caught her.  I let her go. I let her go Diminished and flat, as after radical surgery. How your bad dreams possess and endow me.  I am inhabited by a cry. Nightly it flaps out Looking, with its hooks, for something to love.  I am terrified by this dark thing That sleeps in me; All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.  Clouds pass and disperse. Are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables? Is it for such I agitate my heart?  I am incapable of more knowledge. What is this, this face So murderous in its strangle of branches? -  Its snaky acids hiss. It petrifies the will. These are the isolate, slow faults That kill, that kill, that kill.

      sometimes i think i will always be alone. That no one will ever really love me and my whole life will go by. no one will ever really want to grab me and kiss me, the kind of kiss that takes your breath away. no  one will ever cry because i have broken their heart or because they can't stand to go on another second without me. no one will ever write a love song about me or watch me when i am sleeping. no one will ever tell me i am the most beautiful person they have ever met. no one will ever move the hair out of my eyes and touch my face.  no one will ever feel that desperate longing, right on the edge of sadness and euphoria, when you love somone so much you don't know what to do.

      I knew it would go back to this. not as terrible as it was before but it is still not good. i guess 4 or 5 days were all he could take at being nice to me. the past 2 weeks have sucked. im being ignored and rejected AGAIN. why do i keep thinking that things are going to change?? i don't know how to react to this. i am trying to ignore it and go with the flow but i am feeling desperate and lonely again. I am trying not to go back there.

      Things have actually been going pretty well.  We found out we are having another little boy! We have to the perinatologist on wenesday because the tech said the baby's bowel was distended.  So I have been worried about that but hopefully there is nothing wrong. D has been much better lately. After the stunt he pulled last friday, I thought things were never going to change but just when i didn't expect it, they did.  he has been so kind and affectionate and loving, it is like he is a whole new person.  i don't feel that deperate hatred that filled me before.  We did it twice within 4 days which never happens and it was really nice. part of me wonders if it is the blacklist thing or maybe the scripts i got form the neurologost for my migraines that precipitated these changes. i want to think he finally stepped outside himself and realized what he was doing. i want to think he realized how important i am to him and how much he loves me. i really really want to think that.

      i cant believe he has the balls to accuse *ME* of not trying. We havent had sex for 10 days (and he knew every single night i wanted too) and i am the on e that doesn't try?? I always tell him how much i love him, how handsome and sexy he is, i write him little notes, i do all the things he asks me to do. i pretend to happy i don't cry i don't nag him and he still won't fucking sleep with me. that is what hurts the most. that he lies in bed next to every single night and he has absolutely no sexual feeling for me at all. even if i try to be sexy and wear my VS and i try to touch him it just has absolutly no effect on him at all. this is day number 10 and i don't know how much longer i can take it. i guess i am just counting the day until our couseling appt. I have pretended to be happy for the last 10 days so he would have sex me with me and i just cant do it anymore. no matter i what i do he still doesnt want me. he still doesnt feel anything for me. i cant pretend anymore i cant. it kills me. it terars me apart and i cant take it anymore.

      i am trying to be ok with this. i am trying really hard to be happy and not to complain or ask questions or cry. It is still really hard. I wore my VS underwear set yesterday but i should have known it would have no effect. I am proud of myself for not crying. this is day number 9. My u/s is on monday so i have been thinking about that alot. the baby has been kicking alot and it is pretty strong too. i have been worried about other family issues too, so it makes whining about myself all the time seem pretty stupid.    he ia t the store now and he has been gone for a long time. i know if i ask him why he took so long he will just yell at me. am i just being really stupid??  he is acting funny today, makes me think he is up to something. i cant accuse him with no proof or he will freak out. i feel like i just cant do anything.  i am not allowed to feel anything. i just have to pretend i am this happy fake girl so maybe just maybe my husband will have sex with me and it SUCKS.

      Rejected for the 900th millionith time. Boy don't i feel like shit. i have come to the realization that he has no sexual feelings for me at all. he lies next to me in bed every night and feels absolutely nothing. nothing makes me feel more stupid and fat and ugly then that. i dont know what to do. just ignore him i guess. paying attention to him and writing him notes and telling him how handsome i think he is does absoletly nothing. he still treats me like an annoying stranger. like someone who is just *there* i am just a big fat ugly nothing.

      i lost my last 2 posts so i hope this one goes through. yes, i am jealous of my own kids. how pathetic is that?? i can lay next to d for hours and nothing. but as soon as the baby comes by he is all over him hugging him and kissing him. why does he show all of his affection to the kids and none towards me? Just makes me feel like more of a pathetic ugly stupid loser then i already do.  i spent another horrible night lying in bed, waiting, trying not to cry, so he wouldn't yell at me. I tried reading To Kill a Mockingbird, trying to force back the tears and the sobs. i went for a walk and sat outside so i could cry without him hearing me. it was a horrrible horrible night. and of course absolutely nothing. i make myself totally available to him at anytime and he does absolutley nothing. i offered to scratch his back. he said no. i asked him to sit outside with me. he said no.   i decided i am going to wait for him to initiate it. This is day number 6.

      i don't know why it has to be like this. every night i wait and wait and wait. i am so stupid. i just lie there and wait and fantasize about him coming up behind me and grabbing me and it will NEVER happen. it will just never happen. whats' wrong with me. why isn't he attracted to me. he could have sex with me any time of any day and i just wait and wait and wait. i don't know what to do but just cry and cry and cry.

      sometimes i think these really evil thoughts. sometimes i hate him SO BADLY. he woke me up eating VERY loudly, didnt' say he was sorry, then fell asleep and snored so LOUDLY there was no way i was going to fall back asleep. then i go to take one of my pills because i can't sleep and ANOTHER one is gone. after i begged him for the millionith time to NOT take any of my pills. I HATE SO MUCH RIGHT NOW. I HATE HIM IHATE HIM I HATE HIM IHATE HIM I HATE HIM. why is he so fucked up. why does he keep hurting me over and over and over. why do i keep taking it?? what the fuck is wrong with me that he thinks he can treat me this way. why does he continue to treat me like shit, when all i do is love him???

      The last post got cut short because he came home. i tried my hardest not to yell and throw things at him and we actually had a half way decent dicussion about everything that has been going on. i do  understand more of what he is thinking but he still doesn't really acknowledge all the horrible things that he does. I don't think he *really* understand all the pain he has put us through. hopefully the  marriage counseler can help with that. of course I am still suspicious and i just know he will lie to  me again. he does it so easliy with no remorse. And i just have to sit back and wait. I HATE it so  much. I HATE always being suspicious and worrying and crying all the time. i wish i just had a normal  husband that is nice to me and doesnt lie to me. i am still stressed out so much over all the bills we  have to pay. we are going to be stuck here forever. hopefully when s moves out and we have the other  room things will be better. i know it is going to be hard when the baby comes. especially since it is  right before christmas. right now we are just walking on eggshells and not really saying anything. i  am trying my best not to bother him and cry all the time and he is *supposed* to try to be nice to me  although he seems to have a very hard time with that. he said some things i have still wonder about but  i am scared to bring them up. maybe i will tonight if he is being nice.  i am still really confused.  i feel so numb now, i cant even cry it seems. and i have been having terrible migraines, just to add  to all the great stuff that has going on. sigh

      Still the same. it has been 16 days. I am trying really really hard to not let it bother me. Still worried about the problems they found with the baby. Praying by my next ultrasound they will be gone. I think we have decided to name him Peter for now.
