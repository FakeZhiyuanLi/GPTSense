      My neighbor is having a baby any day now so I sat down the other day on my front porch and turned out a cute little baby hat in some vintage dusty rose yarn I found at goodwill one day.&nbsp; I have about 10, one ounce skeins.&nbsp; It is quite thin, saying on the package it is good for socks, baby articles and lace.&nbsp; I think the hat is darling, and will take a photo of it tomorrow.  Otherwise I have been knitting a bit on COn's sweater, it is just too freakin hot to think of sweaters right now.&nbsp;  I also have been knitting on Sherri's poncho...switching it up between panels of garter and stocking stitch...I may throw another stitch pattern in there at some point, just sort of winging it.

      Yesterday someone on ljknitting posted that the barnes and noble in her area had the suss knit kits on sale.  I knew from looking at them before that they ran about 40 bones for a pattern, yarn, bamboo needles, crochet hook and tapestry needle.  I had priced out the yarn a couple different times and it was anywhere between 15-30 dollars depending on what I used.  Well I got this kit for 10 bones.  yahoo.  I actually bought two, thinking I would do one poncho for Sarah's holiday present and perhaps one for my mom, although I still think I will do a heavy weight shawl for her.  My co-worker sherri really liked one of them so bought it from me and is having me knit it up for her.  I may go back and purchase the other poncho kit they had left.  I started on it last night and it will knit up really quickly.  I had to take a small break from COn's sweater...I'll go back and forth between these two projects for a bit.  JWW

      I found out today that the library in beaverton (not my usual local one, but the huge branch) carries interweave knits.  I got several back issues and will put some of the newer ones on hold.  Yahoo.  I was also able to get a couple other knitting books.  I have to page through them and see if there is anything in there to go with the pale yellow yarn I just won on ebay.  I have several more auctions I am looking and watching...but don't really know if I will even bid.  I shouldn't, but there are some nice angoras and a couple wools that I really like the colors of.  The lots are in big enough batches that I should be able to make a sweater for myself.   I have worked on Conor's sweater just a tiny bit this weekend.  I did get the back done, and have the first 8 rows done on the front.  I am now ready to move onto the bigger needles.  Going to get going on that tomorrow.  JWW

      I have been slow to knit these last few days.  I did knit at the blues festival this weekend, but just about 6 rows on Conor's sweater.  It was all Alicen would let me get done.  I have about 1 1/2 inches left on the back, then I will begin on the front, and actually have to work on shaping and such.  I am a bit freaked by it all.  I did win one auction today for some yarn...I am thinking of a soft, short sleeved BASIC sweater for myself.  I am bidding on a bunch more, although I don't know if I will end up with any of it.   that's all for now, it has been too warm to really feel like knitting, and I have had good books on loan from the library so that has also slowed me down.  JWW

      Today Alicen and I went to the knitting bee.  I knew I had no money to spend, which is why I hadn't gone there lately, but we had such a lovely time.  When we got there the owner was just leaving with a bundle of yarn to make another sample for her shop and the new clerk, Christina, was working.  Alicen and I walked around looking at all the samples, touching some amazing yarn and then sat on the floor by the toys and books so Alicen could play and Christina and I looked through knitting books and talked about knitting.  It was fabulous.  I confessed I hadn't come in as much as I would like to because I was on a strict budget at the moment.  She didn't hesitate to say I should just come in to hang out and knit, talk about knitting whatever.  I was so pleased.  I told her I was making my first sweater and she asked me to bring it in and show her the progress on it.  She loved Alicen's poncho and wanted to know if I would write up the pattern.  I told her I didn't know if I could since I winged it so much.  But that I would think about it. There was a poncho in the shop that I REALLY want to make.  It is on Large needles and drapes asemetrically.  LOVED it.  must go, lili sleeping and need to finish Miles' room. JWW

        this is the slipper that i really thought I would love.  I don't.  I find that the toes are too pointed and they are quite slick to wear.  I have almost fallen several times. I would like to find a better slipper pattern.     this was a hat I knit up quickly for an auction at my older sons preschool.  I liked this hat, but it was a bit big.  I guessed on the cast on.  This was before I figured out how to read a pattern.  I am still not 100% on patterns but I am getting better.    booga J before and...   booge J after.  This was the bag of the season it seemed.  Almost everyone I "know" knit this bag this year.  I really liked it very much.  I loved the felting process and really want to do more of these.  I gave this one to my mom for mother's day.     this is the other purse that I made this year.  I used this one quite a lot, and liked all the compliments I got on it.  I wasn't thrilled with the handles, and may try redoing them or using an icord.     I made two of these scarves this year.  One for Alicen and one for her July03 buddy.  It was just a quickie scarf, but this was way back in the begining of knitting and I thought I would be content to knit scarves forever. I just loved the process.        two more scarves, one for my mother and one for my son.  and this is the very first finished knit object.    I was so proud of it.  I gave it to my friend Sarah...but had to wear it myself first.  I know there are a couple other things (scarves for others) that I don't have photos of right now, but this is the main gist of it...now I have to actually get more knitting done so I can post more photos :-)

      this is the only shot I can find of the twin peaks shawl.  It calls for 500 yards of baby mohair boucle.  I LOVE this shawl.  I plan to make more.  in this yarn it is light and airy, but in the acrylic version I made to practice it is actually quite warm.  I want to make a winter weight one for my mom's holiday present.

      This is the birthday dress I made for Alicen when she turned one year old.  I bought the yarn at walmart for 70 cents a skein, and used only part of one skein.  This was based on a pattern for a sweater for an older child.  I didn't add the arms, and I made it a bit longer for a dress for my petite wonder.  I didn't gauge the neckline very well so I closed it with a cute flower pin. here are a couple snapshots of it.

      I am going to start backwards because I don't know if I can find photos of all my knit stuff.  This little beauty is what I just finished.  It is based on a large shawl pattern that I got from ONE MORE ROW.  It is called the twin peaks shawl.  I changed it up by making it *much* smaller and turning it into a poncho.  I also added some delicate pink ribbon detailing.  I love it.  I have gotten so many compliments on my daughter wearing it.  This was knit with goodwill yarn, I have no idea the kind, color or yardage.    I had to try it on winnie the pooh the night I finished it. Here is the "arm" detail   and a full shot of winnie in poncho   JWW

      I had been toying with the idea of creating a journal/blog for just my knitting things as it has become quite the obsession.  I am not so great at it yet, but I am learning.  I would like to keep a record of the things I have done, and create a space for feeling accomplished. so that is what this will be.
