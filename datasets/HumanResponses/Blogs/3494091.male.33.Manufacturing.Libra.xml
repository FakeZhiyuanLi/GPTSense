      that was said by my good friend roger once, as he was drunkenly hanging onto an awning over a door of a small cafe. of course, immediately after he said that, it cam crashing down and we all ran off into the night.  los angeles is a fucking great city and it's been great to me. i live in a loft in downtown los angeles. i woke up this morning early and drove roughly 30 minutes to the beach, where i got my kidneys pounded by the 10-foot surf of the pacific ocean and a pretty good sunburn.  you can do anything here in los angeles. yes, there stuff about los angeles that everyone always complains about does suck, but that's just one part of it. los angeles is filled with people who hate it. they are stuck here working in the entertainment industry and they aren't making the big bucks, so it's a struggle. cry me a river. life in the big city is tough. suck it up, crybaby.  los angeles (and california) have been great to me. i knew once i stepped off the plane for a 2-week vacation in 1993 that this was my ne home. i never left. adios, east coast. have a nice winter. i suffered for a little, then fell ass-backwards into money and some degree of fame and fortune in the music buisness (artist side). that came to a rather abrupt screeching halt when i got fed up with the bullshit. nothing 6 months or so in hawaii couldn't fix though, right?  now, i work as a designer for the biggest video game company in the world on arguably one of the top 10 game titles in the world. the last game i worked on sold 5 million copies and is still selling (and is also viewed as a failure by the company...whatever...more ranting about that to come).  life is good. los angeles is good. my dog is good.  - art.  np - "edward appleby (in memorium)" - rushmore soundtrack

      online dating is weird.  many of us do it. there are many reasons. my reason to try it was because as i begin to get to an age where you are supposed to act like an adult, i realized that my interest in bars and getting wasted and trolling for girls is incredibly hollow and ultimately unsatisfying.  so, i found myself on an internet dating sight. you make up a profile and post it along with photos that you think accurately depicts who you are and hopefully, the type of animal you are interested will wander into your area because they smelled something good to eat.  so now, you have a virtual human zoo. you stroll around, looking in all of the pretty environments (but let's face it...you can dress it up all you want...it's still a cage) at the inhabitants. you see one you like and you spend some time there. checking it out, reading the little info card. you learn about what it likes, what it dislikes, it's habits and fears. you become educated in it's entire life (or at least a smart, punchy bio-blast cramming the life into a short paragraph) and then you make a choice. is this one of my favorite animals or not. if you choose yes, that particular animal goes into another smaller, exclusive, private collection. now you have all of your favorite animals in your own private zoo.  this is the part that creeps me out the most. the personal people collection. more on this later...  today i'm meeting someone from my personal collection. i've developed a really great friendship with her online and over the phone. we are already very well-suited for each other. it's like i've known her a year already. we have everything in common. it all started very carefully, and as guards were let down, it became very apparent that something was there. as of late, i've noticed that the "romantic" element has gone by the wayside and the friend part has been developing at a rapid pace. our meeting should be interesting. i'm pushing for romance.  - art.  np - "self destruction, final" - nine inch nails. kind of on a thing right now...

      i'm just going to say "i told you so" to myself right now.  hopefully that will serve as sufficient punishment when someone in the future reads this and finds out something about me or themselves that they were previously unaware of.  i still have not decided whether or not to use real names to protect the innocent (and not so innocent) in my posts. actually, it's really about protecting me, isn't it? i mean, i am doing this anonymously...  i'm going to have to sleep on that one.  - art  np - nine inch nails "leaving hope". "still" is possibly one of the greatest pieces of music ever recorded. this record makes me feel music in a way that i haven't felt in a long time. you should listen to it. in headphones.
