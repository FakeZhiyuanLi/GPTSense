      I didn't dream much last night. I fell asleep around midnight and slept deeply. Here's what I do remember:  &nbsp;  I dreamed I was going hiking and at the top of the hill was Mara, an old friend of mine who I have not spoken to in years. She was with someone else I knew and we stopped to chat. I explained to her that I was just starting to exercise because I had broken my ankle ( in real life I do have a broken ankle) and she started to cry. Not loudly but tears rolling down her face and it seemed she had something important to say to me - something deep and meaningful but I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I didn't want to tell her I lost my job because my continuous state of unemployment is just down right embarrassing,&nbsp;so I said "bye" and left. I was thinking she could always call me if she had something to say and then I wondered if she was crying because I had gotten so fat over the past couple years. I thought, is my weight such a tragedy that people actually cry about it? Could that be possible?  &nbsp;  There was another dream that had to do with me protecting a briefcase but I can't remember anything else.  &nbsp;  60 second analysis: I have struggled with my weight for the past couple of years and currently I am on a roll with eating right and exercising. I'm certain that's where the weight issues come in. As for climbing or hiking that's a reference to a challenge and in this case again my struggle with weight. As for Mara crying, it could be a reference to leaving something in my past behind. Something sad? I don't know.  &nbsp;  Anyway, here's what I ate last night:  &nbsp;  lentil's &amp; brown rice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 400&nbsp;&nbsp; Cal  Hot dog &amp; bun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 350&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cal  Red Peppers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp; Cal  3 eggs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 225&nbsp; Cal  Sundae&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 340&nbsp;&nbsp;Cal   TOTAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1320 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Not bad, I need to stay under 1500 to keep loosing weight. Now, I just need to get some exercise in this weekend. &nbsp;&nbsp;

      I vaguely remember this dream from last night...  I dreamed I was living in my old apartment in Connecticut when I heard a noise outside. I went to investigate and there was a huge Polar Bear lying in the snow. The bear was sick but friendly and so incredibly soft and warm. She let me pet and hug her. Then I realized she just had babies and wolves were attacking the tiny Polar bears. I freaked out and started beating the wolves and hollering for someone to call animal control. No one did so I made the call.   Animal Control arrived and I explained the situation. They took her and the one surviving baby away to the zoo and reassured me that they would take good care of her. I was greatly relieved.   Then I started to walk towards my apartment which was now on the 1st floor. Earlier in the dream it had been on the second floor and looked identical to a recurring apartment scene I frequently see in my dreams. The dream apartment looks exactly like my home in Connecticut but it's decorated differently and there's always a lot more light than the real placed I lived. The neighborhood always looks the same and is the neighborhood I lived in. That never changes.   Anyway, as I was walking to my apartment these tiny dogs began to run inside a hole in the screen door and I started screaming at my neighbor to get her animals out of the house. Secretly I wasn't angry but I was so distressed from the Polar bear situation that I needed to vent and she just happed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. So I yelled at her and it felt really good. Then I woke up.  60 second analysis: Last night Dan and I watched "The 90's" on VH1 and I was having trouble enjoying it because the early 90's were brutal for me. In fact the show down right pissed me off.   In the early 90's I lived with my now ex-boyfriend David who was a complete and total fucking asshole. We broke up in 94 and I drove across the country and settled in Seattle. The rest is history.   Anyway, among the many things I hated about him the worst was that he was an intellectual and cultural snob. It was a constant source of tension. No, we couldn't get cable, and I was only allowed to listen to Nirvana and Pearl Jam in my car. The only movies we could see were artsy farts flick by Merchant Ivory. They make movies like: Jane Austen, the Remains of the Day (which was pretty good) and the Ballad of the Sad Café. I had to drag him to see anything fun. He mocked the X-Files, Melrose Place (we only got one channel without cable) and only boasted that he only listened to NPR. All these things: grunge music, Dr Dre and Snoop dog, TV, popular movies, and even tiny things like wanting to get a George Foreman grill were beneath him. BARF, BARF, BARF! What a dick.   I'm certain the dream taking place in Connecticut is a reference to my life with him. As for the Polar bear - I'm not sure what that means. I'm tempted to say it's a representation of me during that time because after she was taken to safety I had a new apartment. So, leaving changed where I lived just like my move to Seattle. Her having babies and them being devoured by wolves may parts of me that were dying from living in a situation that didn’t fit with who I am. This is my best guess.

      WOW - crazy dream last night. I dreamed I was a shoplifting stoner trying to get weed on a cruise ship to Mexico.  I dreamed my husband (Dan) was a thug and had a friend that dealt marijuana. It's bizarre - his friend looked like this guy I knew when I was 14. In real life his name was Dave but everyone called him DC because he was crazy about AC/DC. I and Richard Harbstreet got high in his basement once and he lined up packs of matches on his parents bar and played some AC/DC song that started with FIRE and then he lit the first match setting off a chain reaction so it appeared like the bar was on fire. We were impressed but then again we were 15 and stoned. As a side note the three of us used to like to write our names in gasoline and then set it one fire. What can I say there wasn't a lot to do in New Jersey when it was too cold to go to the shore.   Back to the dream...  Dave and Dan were going to rip someone off and it looked like we were on Yessler in Seattle. As they were walking I slipped my hand into Dave's pocket and pulled out a handful of joints. I quickly put them in my pocket and I was eager to get away to somewhere private to smoke them.   Then I was walking around Queen Ann smoking this huge joint and I ran into some Buddhists. The joint was literally the size of a cigar. As I talked to them I casually smoked my doobie like it was a cigarette and thought, "Maybe I shouldn't be doing this in front of them."   Then Dan and I were in a hotel that looked a lot like my old apartment in Connecticut I was smoking pot and he didn't care. He just didn't want me to drink. He told me we were taking a cruise and I wanted to buy more pot from Dave and take it with us on the cruise ship. Dan said, "We'll have to get it past the drug sniffing dogs so you better buy some Spanish coffee to wrap it in." I wanted to know: did I need to get the coffee ground or could I just hide it in the beans or did I need to get coffee grounds. I had heard the latter worked from an old episode of Miami Vice. He didn't know.   I went to Walmart and thought, "There's no way they'll have any decent Spanish coffee. Everyone that shops here is so white bread middle America all they most like have is Folgers and Maxwell House coffee." And sure enough when I got there all I could find was those two brands. Finally, after searching each shelf I found one bag of Spanish coffee." Instead of paying for it I just put it in my purse and walked out.   I brought the Spanish coffee back to the hotel and Dave said, "Oh the best way to get pot past drug sniffing dog is to UPS it. I'll just send it overnight." And sure enough the minute we walked onto the cruise ship I was handed a UPS envelope filled with the most beautiful marijuana I had ever seen. I was eager to smoke it but first we needed to check out our room on the ship.   As it turns out we were sharing a room with frat boys and sorority girls who were drinking heavily. Dan didn't want me around so much drinking so we tried to change our room. Just before I woke up we were planning to go to the top of the ship and smoke some weed.   WOW, I’m a shoplifting stoner in my dreams. I wonder what that means.

      Last night a had a few odd dreams.  In one dream I was climbing though a large frosty pipe into frozen tundra. When I peered outside of the pipe there were snow capped mountains and I slid and slid for miles and miles until I came to a supermarket. I went shopping lifting and I stole add kinds of make-up. Mostly blue colored eye shadows and lip glosses. Then I went to a ghetto that was somewhere in Seattle to clean out a dirty fridge.  Then I was working at the democratic convention. I was a banquet waitress and we were all watching the election on a big screen. Kerry was winning but then the terrorists attacked. The building starting coming down and everything was shaking. As the room began to implode Bush's votes starting going up and up until he won the election. I was really pissed.  what a bummer. I hope it's not a premonition.
