      Buzzflash.com is a great website. It's not flashy and is essentially just a bunch of links to articles and editorials on the web. It leans left and provides liberals like me a place to go for validation of of our beliefs. AM radio and cable news is so angry, depressing, right-wing, evil and sad. If you've ever heard Michael Savage's show he is the absolute worst! I know I shouldn't tune in because I just wind up screaming at the radio but I feel like I need to know what they are saying. Right now on Buzzflash.com there are letters from people commenting about the DNC convention coverage by the "journalists" and pundits. I've been thinking about the same stuff lately. CNN is getting to be as bad as Fox News. It's amazing how critical they are of the speakers. I swear if the Bush thugs get another term I'm going to look at Canada as a possible place to live. I guess I'm all over the place with this post but it's what's going through my head today.

      Al rocks! I really enjoyed him during the Democratic primaries but tonight at the convention he was&nbsp;incredible. &nbsp;He really shakes things up. The crew at CNN are all a tither about the length and content of this speech. It's a riot. The talking heads don't know how to deal with anyone who's not polite. We need more Al's to fire up the sleeping voters who don't yet quite realize that GWB is killing America. Our course this is my opinion and I'm a self-described "Proud Mass Liberal in Arizona!"

      "They will be in a position 'so they can surge quickly to deal with unexpected threats,' Bush said." (from his Cincinnati VFW speech)  I thought this was interesting...isn't the whole idea behind national security and the recommendations of the 9/11 committee that there be no "unexpected threats" from terrorist groups or nations? If the agencies are doing their jobs there shouldn't be anymore surprises. Besides, having troops in Europe probably means they'd be physically closer to where these "unexpected threats" originate.  To me, this looks like an election year stunt to win over veterans who are on the fence about Kerry. It's just another play for votes from the heartland. Hopefully the enough voters in Ohio will see through it and the state will go for Kerry.

      I find it incredible that John McCain would go out and campaign for George W. Bush after what the Bush campaign did to him in 2000. McCain's character and record were assaulted by the chosen president's team. I'm all for party unity but this is ridiculous. It makes me wonder what skeletons Bush would create for McCain if he didn't do it. I like John Edwards but I would have liked a Kerry-McCain ticket too. As an Arizona resident I find his moderate stance almost Democratic in the sea of Republicans that represent this state. I emailed him to let him know I appreciated his "no" vote for the stupid marriage ammendment. I just hate to see McCain as one of Bush's poster boys.
