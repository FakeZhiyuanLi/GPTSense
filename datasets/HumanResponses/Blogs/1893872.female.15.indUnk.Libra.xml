      hello people.  how is everyone today?  im ok i guess i could be better who everyone could.  today was a normal day.  nothing really happened.  all the periods today were fine.  well in art it was freaky bcuz someone kicked the folder cabinet and the teacher got all mad.  if no one confesed we were all gonna get saturday school.  i dont know if someone said it was them or not but i hope so bcuz i dont want a saturday school.  anywho other than that today was a normal day.  my bf and i were ok today.  i little fight but nothing big.  i wish there was no fights what-so-ever but all relationships have fights no matter how perfect 2 people are ment to be. at the moment i am so hungry and i dont even know why.  i feel like having taco bell but i have no money to get food.  at the time im talking to eric.  i was talking to daniel like a minute ago but he had to go.  oh wait... now eric left me to.  well not really but he is talking to cat and i dont want to be there. my birthday is coming up.  im so happy (like ve said for the bilionth time).  if i get money im going to treat myself to taco bell.  mmm... good stuff right there.  oh another good news is that steph is making this thing where people vote one of eahc between 2 girls and 2 guys.  the girls are grace and i and the guys are mychal and daniel.  as for the girls i know whos gonna win... grace.  that was a given.  lol.  oh today stupid carlos scared me bcuz he made me go to a website and look for waldo but after a few seconds an ugly face came on and scared the hell out of me.  it was funny as hell though.  well this is where i end it today bcuz nothing else to write.  bye bye everyone.  take care. yours always ::pathetic little me::

      hello people.  today was an ok and bad day.  i dont really want to talk about the bad part all i want to say is that im sorry (they know who im talking about).  the ok part of my day was that some of my friends came over.  we watched music videos and paul ended up falling for my mom... ("debbies mom has got it goin on").  lol.  inside joke.  well anywho today was ok but then it got really bad. something that has been bothering me all day... well for a while now... its two people that are in my school.  they say that theyre my friends but i dont really believe them now.  i feel ignored by one of them and i feel like i cant trust the other one.  i have no idea what to think of them.  i know that they have both been talking behind my back but i cant seem to get the guts to tell them.  i hope that they would just tell me to my face.  i would love it if everyone told me what they thought of me to my face or in an email.  you know what... heres my email address... bugala678@yahoo.com... email me saying what you really think of me.  if you write to me i will really appreciate it and id thank you very much.  if you read this i am personaly asking you to.  it would mean a lot.  as the subject write "my feelings".  ill read them as soon as posible.  thank you again. anywho right now im talking to daniel.  were talking about birthday presents bcuz his birthdays is coming up.  i cant wait for my birthday this year.  nothing has gone really bad.  i love it.  well one thing did go really bad but another one got really good so i guess they cancel each other out.  i just hope everything goes good this month and i get no fown calls (bad ones).  speaking of this month i cant wait til halloween.  i love halloween.  its my favorite holiday.  i was gonna be a fairy but not anymore bcuz grace told me she was and i dont want to ruin her halloween.  i guess i have to think about it some more. homecoming is coming.  lol.  that sounds funny.  well yeah its coming soon and i really want to go.  i want to dance and ive been wanting to.  i love dancing.  kristyday should know bcuz everytime i hear a beat at school or anywhere we walk i start dancing.  lol.  yes i know im dumb but like mario said its the mental people who look like they are having fun and guess what?!?!  i fan lots of fun.  lol.  thats for you mario.  well back to the dance.  i want to go but i dont know if my bf will take me bcuz he doesnt really like to dance.  i hope he does take me bcuz i really want to go. anywho i must get going bcuz i have to go to school tomorrow and i need to finish my homework.  bye bye.  take care. yours always ::pathetic little me::

      hello people.  today was eh not really good but some good things happened today.  today i felt alone to tell you the truth.  in most of my classes i was just there actually doing my work writing a letter or just trying to talk to people.  during 2cd period i talked to paul and catherine and i did my work.  during 4th i talked a bit to martin a bit michael and just for a like a min to carlos.  i havent really talked or anything with carlos.  :(.  anywho during art it was fun.  im almost done with the project ss im happy.  i love that period bcuz its so fun and i love to draw and pain and color.  its also fun bcuz i sit with vincent christina h. and jazmin.  well after that jazmin and i had tennis.  it was quite fun today bcuz... ummm... i dont even know why it just was.  well the reason i felt alone was bcuz i knew there was something wrong with a couple of people around me and how they are feeling toward me at the time.  it makes me sad bcuz i dont like when people hate me or dislike me.  i dont think anyone likes it and no one likes losing friends.  :(.  im so happy bcuz i have people to talk to and be my friends even though some arent anymore.  for some reason im doubting some friends of mine.  i have my reasons but i rather not say to public.  *sigh. well my birthday is coming up.  im actually happy!  :D.  10 more days!  i just want to have all my friends with me that day.  i hope this will be a good birthdya bcuz the past birthdays havent been all that great.  well 2 of them have.  (1.) when christina a. made me a little birthday party at the park after school and (2.) when mychal took me to dinner with his family.  i loved those times bcuz i felt special.  *saying to mychal and christina a.* thanks to both of you and your families for making my birthday something good to remember. guess what?!?!  i love this month.  for some odd reason my sisters are being so nice to me.  my parents arent but hey my sisters are and i love it bcuz they talk to me.  :D.  i love it! anywho right now im talking to daniel a bit to steph and a bit to vincent.  i had metioned before that vincent didnt come to my sisters party and i found out why... it was bcuz... ummm... well he didnt want to be here bcuz of someone that was here.  im sorry i dont want to really say much but i understand vincent.  i am talking to daniel about doing sit-ups.  lol.  anywho i must get going now.  bye bye.  take care. yours always ::pathetic little me::

      hello people.  today was an all around good day.  nothing really went wrong today maybe just a bit with my bf after 5th period but after school and stuff it was way better.  today at school i had a good time in pe chem and art.  i hate math analysis wld. civ. and english.  anywho today my bf transfered to my pe class (well not really but yeah) and i loved that.  i liked chem bcuz its always fun in that class.  mr curtis is so fun and funny.  i also liked it bcuz i wasnt there for most of it bcuz my tennis coach called my to get some things ready for the game.  art is always fun bcuz i love painting drawing and stuff.  the other classes i hate bcuz (math) the teacher isnt fun and doesnt know how to teach (wld. civ.) the teacher isnt fun at all (english) its so boring!  oh well i guess i have to go through that the whole year.  anywho today i went to my ortho dr guy after school and they just put a new wire and stuff.  nothing much but i still had to go.  after that i went to my sisters house and stayed there for about 30 min helping my nephew with his homework and then left with my sister to big 5 to buy my tennis thing.  i should be doing math homework but ill do it after this blog is done. guess what??!?  i got a gift today.  it was a star bracelet.  a different one from the one daniel gave me.  this one is from jazmin and its like a best friend thing.  i love it but then again i love all the stuff that people give me.  at first i feel bad bcuz they spend money on me but then i love the fact that they thought of me  yeah i know i am a geek and an idiot(sandra).  lol. right now im talking to sandra daniel a bit to andrew.  i must be going now bcuz i need to do my homework.  bye bye.  take care. yours always ::pathetic little me::

      hello people.  today was great yet boring.  in the morning i woke up and cleaned and talked to whoever was online and mychal on the fown.  after that i went to mychals house for a while to help him with his homework and just to go see him.  to tell you the truth i love spending time with him.  the more time i spend with him the more i like my day.  i feel like sometimes he doesnt want to be with me (not as in realationship wise but as in mext to each other) and much as i do but i cant help it.  well after that i came back home and talked to him again for a while.  then it got boring bcuz i stopped talking to him and no one is really online that i can talk to.  anywho that was my day.  not really much to say now so i guess til tomorrow.  bye bye.  take care. yours always ::pathetic little me::

      hello.  i would like to start of by saying my sorry that i havent written in like 2 days when i promised myself to.  anywho yesterday was my sisters bithday and today is her birthday party.  today i was taking care of mychal bcuz one of my little cousins hit my and he got hurt so i took care of him.  i think he feels better now but im not sure.  my sisters party was all chunti.  lol.  mychal and i were making fun of it the whole way through.  vincent was suppose to come but i guess christina didnt let him or he just didnt want to come.  well it was still fun bcuz i had mychal with me here.  if it wasnt for him i would be in my room like i am now.  at the moment im talking to pedro and daniel and just a bit to grace. well so i can catch you guys up into what ive been doing here it is.  on thrusday i had an ok day and had tennis.  jazmin and i played doubles against other people and we won 2 games!  this upcoming thrusday is my first game.  its against south el monte high.  its away so not many people will go (which is a good thing for me).  im kinda excited but then scared bcuz its my first game but i still suck at tennis.  now on to friday.  on friday i went out to eat at dennys with steph her cousin daniel paul and mychal.  it was fun and stuff bcuz funny stories were told.  after that i went to mychals house and stayed there for about 1 hour then left to the football game at my school and after that to the dance.  i kinda got my groove on but not really.  i liked the music though it was very dance-able. well those were my days.  i know boring but hey just be thankful theyre not yours.  if you ever have any comments im me at babycakes678j since i dont have those things so you can display them.  ill be nice if you im me.  :).  bye bye.  take care. yours always ::pathetic little me::

      hello people.  it seems like today was my day but then wasnt.  the good thing i can say about today is that i got a bracelet and a dress.  i got a star bracelet with different colors form daniel.  he had gotten it long time ago but be barely gave it to me.  thank you daniel i liked it very much.  the dress i got is such a pretty dress.  its like a princess one.  i love it.  also on the good side of my day i noticed something.  my sisters have been a lot more nicer now.  i love it bcuz even faby is being nice.  the down part is that my parents havent but thats ok.  to my down side lets just say i tried to help but couldnt.  im just a f- up f-in up their life. anywho on to another subject home-coming is coming up.  i really want to go bcuz it would be my first real dance at pioneer.  on friday theres a game and a dance.  i dont want to go to that dance bcuz its not very appeling to me.  there is also a football game that day but i want to go but then i dont.  i want to bcuz i dont want to come home or do nothing but i do bcuz it gives me something to do.  im still confused but ill choose tomorrow. guess whats in 17 days?!?!  MY 15TH BIRTHDAY!  OCTOBER 4TH!  ive never been happy about any of my birthdays but for some reason i feel like nothing back is going to happen this birthday.  the reason why ive never been happy is bcuz REALLY bad things tend to happen around my birthday or on my birthday.  it really sucks but oh well.  i feel like this year will be different and not that many things will go wrong. sorry but i got to cut it short today bcuz i feel like lying on my bed and think.  bye bye.  take care. your always ::pathetic little me::

      hello people.  today was a cool eh and funny day.  it was cool bcuz at school it didnt just seem like a regular day to me (i dont know why bcuz it was but yeah) it seemed like most people were happy.  it was eh bcuz after school i went to eat with some cousins abd stuff and it wasnt fun.  today was funny bcuz after eating my sisters mom and i went to go looking for a dress for me since i have to go take pictures.  well anyway it was funny bcuz i would keep trying on nice dresses and by the end i was just trying on anything that fit me.  there was this bright lime green yellow dress just my size and i tried it on and i looked so funny.  i started to laugh so hard it was hilarious!  when i went to eat i played the little games and i got like 175 tickets so i first got a bracelet for mychal bcuz it reminded me of him then a bracelet for me and then i saw this one watch and it looked like the one i had a long time ago and i membered that andrew had said he wanted one so i got one for him.  after i got another bracelet but i didnt get this one by choosing it i got it from my little cousins friend.  anywho i hope mychal likes the bracelet i got for him.  i also hope andrew like the watch.  today i also got to take care of my little baby girl (not my own but my little 6 month old cousin).  shes so pretty and she loves me!  :D. quess what?!?!  tomorrow is going to be my first day with my old 7th/8th grade backpack.  yes thats right i am bringing it back.  i love the bad i use for school now but it has been hurting my shoulder with all the books and stuff.  im sorry mychal i love the backpack but its hurting me a lot.  if i quit math analysis then ill use the bag again.  my 7th.8th grade backpack is so old and it has so many writings on it.  it was like a yearbook in the middle of 7th grade. well hey my dad came in so thats my cue to go.  bye bye.  take care. yours always :pathetic little me:: p.s. i might have a sleepover on my bday but im not sure so i cant invite people yet.

      hello people.  today was sad scary and like pedro said was a lazy day.  today was sad bcuz i heard stuff from a friend that wasnt so nice to hear.  i never really thought id feel this sad over it though.  i said today was scary bcuz my dad was in a car crash.  i got a call form the police and i got so scared so my sister went to go see what was wrong but then like 10 minutes later she called and said that everything was fine but the car.  my other sister is happy bcuz nothing happened to my dad but sad bcuz she has no car now.  like pedro said today was a lazy day.  i didnt feel like doing anything i just wanted to lay down and do nothing.  maybe its bcuz theres school tomorrow but i dont know. anywho ive met a lot of different people online lately.  its kinda weird but i love it bcuz i have more people to talk to during the day.  today i got to talk to joey more bcuz i know his sn so yeah we got to chat a bit.  he showed me this one song it was really sad but i liked it. here are 1 quotes ive had in my head that make sence to me: 1. "im a product of your hate just the one youd create is anybody listening to a word i say? i hate today" 2. "tonight  Ill stand  In the light  So you can count how many tears fall from my eyes  this time ill be alright  my heart cant get any worse" well i dont really know what to write anymore so i guess til tomorrow.  bye bye.  take care. ::pathetic little me::

      hello people.  i dont really want to talk about today but all im gonna say is that it wasnt as good as i expected.  anywho i would like to start off by saying that my bf isnt stupid he knows how to play the drums really good and i love him a lot.  to anyone who thinks otherwise youre wrong.  if you havent heard him play drums you really should bcuz he has only played drums for like 3 months and he has already improved songs and stuff.  i know what your most likely thinking "youre just saying that bcuz your his gf"  well im not.  im saying it bcuz thats what i know.  i said that he isnt stupid bcuz lately he has been feeling like this bcuz a certain someone has been telling him.  well he isnt and again im not only saying it bcuz im his gf.  i also said that i love him a lot and i said that bcuz he doesnt trust me right now.  i dont blame him but i wished he did.  i love him so much and i just wish i could have his trust right now.  everything would be so much better. anywho today was stephs party.  guess what?!?!  i got her a present!  i got her this bracelet but the weird thing was that joey got her one that looks almost the same.  i hope that she still likes the one i gave her more.  im sorry to say but i loved/didnt like the party.  i know that steph knows why but guess what?!?!  things are better now bcuz when he signed off i called and we kinda fixed things.  i love you steph!  (dont worry jackie youre still my wifey and i love you more).  (dont worry mychal i love you more than both). right now i was talking to my bf on the fown but he was too tired.  now im talking to steph daniel billy paul and pedro.  i must go now bcuz im gonna talk to them.  bye bye.  take care. ::pathetic little me::

      hello people.  today was fun fun again and then kinda bad.  it was fun bcuz i had pe today and i was dancing and singing with  twisted foot.  then it was fun again bcuz after school i went to jackies house and i tried on some of her shirts which was fun.  then after that i went back to my school and waitied til the bus got there for drill team and all male.  when the bus got there i walked to lesleys house to get picked up by martha to go to the movies and meet paul and daniel. we saw cabin fever and i was scared the whole way through.  after that we went to eat donuts and when we got there it was scary bcuz a guy with a red had went in there and yelled and the lady who worked there and then the safety people came and looked for him.  toward the end of my day it got not so good bcuz when i got home i picked up the fown and called my bf.  he doesnt really trust me right now but i dont know how to fix that.  im sorry mychal and i love you very much. anywho tomorrow is stephs birthday party and i havent gotten anything for her bcuz i have no money.  i dont even know if i can go.  i hope i can.  if i go i get to see my bf :D.  speaking of him IM TALKING TO HIM RIGHT NOW :D. you know whats been on my mind?!?!  its more like a question... "why am i such a f-up".  its like everywhere i go and everyone im near i f things up.  ive been feeling like this for a while now.  it hurts me but i know i do  things p for the people around me.  to tell you guys the truth i dont feel like i do things right at all.  darn me!  i dont really want to write tonight so ill write tomorrow.  bye bye.  take care. ::pathetic little me::

      hello people.  today was great stupid and ok.  it was great bcuz my bf came after his zero period to my house to eat with me and then during lunch we found our spot at school so he was hugging me for a while :D.  today was also stupid bcuz jazmin and i waited after school bcuz we had tennis pracetice but nobody ended up showing.  when we went to the fron to get picked up we saw our coach there just talking.  it was so stupid bcuz he had us waiting for him.  er to him er!  toward the ending of my day it was ok bcuz i got to talk to people online but then most of them would stop talking to me so id go away.  then when i finally got people to talk to i had to do something for my sister and then i took a shower.  by the time i came back they had to go.  darn it!  oh and tomorrow i might get $10!  (sorry i just almost never get money).  the only bad thing about me getting the money is that i have to wear a skirt.  anyone who really knows me knows that i hate skirts but hey im getting money for it so i dont care. anywho right now i am talking to someone... prung!  hes my bud and i hope im his too.  tomorrow i got invited to go to the movies and hang out at uptown with lesley and other people.  i hope i can go bcuz i dont really want to be home.  on the bright side i think i twisted my ankle more bcuz now it swollen.  you know how i mentioned yesterday that mario was comparing me to a mental person well i told jazmin about it and she says she could picture me as a metal person too.  it was funny but kinda sad bcuz im like a mental person.  today and last night i havent been feeling so great.  i threw up many times last night and today like 30 minutes ago too.  the good thing about it is that it made my tummy feel better. i still need to buy presents for two people.  pedro and stephanie but i have to buy stephs first bcuz her bday is on saturday.  well i have to go bcuz my dad is mad at me well i had nothing else to write anyway so i guess this is where i leave off.  bye bye.  take care. ::pathetic little me::

      hello again.  this thing might say its sunday (which it is) but its still saturday to me bcuz i havent gone to sleep.  i made this blog thinggy bcuz my original website hasnt been working and i just needed to write stuff for you people to know.  the first day of school was on thrusday.  it was kinda boring but hey all first days are boring.  as for the second day it was much better.  i dont know if this school year will be fun like last year of better.  you see my bf just changed schools to mine and he doesnt seem to like it much.  im afraid that he might go back and i dont want that bcuz i used to miss him so very much during school. a while back ago i went to the mall with pedro stephanie her cousin and grace.  for me it was fun.  grace and i bought underwear together :D and we wore them on the same day (yes i know lame but hey it keeps her and i laughing).  throughout some of the time i thought pedro was kinda bored or just didnt want to be there so i felt bad bcuz it was me who kinda made him go.  im sorry if i made you go and made you have a boring time. anywho today i spent the day taking care of my bf :D.  he and i were gonna go to a birthday party but ended up not going bcuz my bf got sick.  i took very good care of him bcuz toward night he was doing better.  oh and as for the birthday party i passed by when i was going home and i dropped of a gift from me and my bf.  it was drum sticks (happy birthday eric!).  oh and guess what?!?!  jackie is my wifey!  :D. well i guess thats all i have to say for now.  bye bye.  take care. ::pathetic little me::

      hello people.  sorry for not writing in a while but it was just that my internet kept going wrong when i would click on internet explorer.  anywho on wed. i went to school and then to burger king with my bf eric vincent steven and grace (we later met up with gaby).  well then on thrusday i had a tennis game at santa fe.  it was horrible.  they cheated so much.  i wanted to kick that little shot thin girls ass.  i kept telling jazmin (in the words of vincent) "shes a freken perra".  well anyway it was fun at the end and before the game started.  at the away games no one from our school really goes.  at the santa fe game only pedro but he doesnt go to pionner anymore (graduated).  as for today (friday "still") i went to school and then came home.  at around 6:20 kalynn 2 of her friends and paul came over bcuz they were gonna get a ride from me to the football game.  at the game there was FIREWORKS!  i was so happy to see them!  after the game my family and i sang happy bithday to my daddy and then eat cake together.  i didnt like the cake so i just sat there and watched them eat.  after i was online for about 30 minutes and i had been talking to my friend pedro.  at last minute we decided to go out to eat bcuz i wanted pancakes bacon and ham.  so we both headed to dennys.  the pancakes were amazing!  well anywho i came back home and tried the internet.  it worked (if you hadnt notice). as for tomorrow i dont know what ill be doing.  maybe go out with my bf or out to a movie.  who knows.  on sunday i have to go to tj with my family bcuz my dad wanted to go for his birthday bcuz he loves these tacos that they have in this little place.  i got to admit they are darn good. well i must be going to bed now bcuz my mommy told me already.  bye bye everyone.  take care please. yours always ::pahtetic little me::

      hello people.  it seems like today wasnt so good as i wanted to be.  at school everything was going fine (well not the saturday school part) and the tennis game went better than i expected.  after the tennis game was when my day started to go eh.  it was around 5 when i left from the game and took mychal home.  when i got home i got in trouble for no reason.  it sucked.  then my mom made me to "shopping" when really we just went to see priscy try on dresses.  throughout the whole time i kept getting my mom mad for NO REASON.  anything i did or said was wrong to her. anywho today mychal pedro christina h. joey and faby went to the game.  im thankful that no one else showed up.  well that was today after school and for tomorrow after school im gonna go to the movies and dinner (i think) with mychal.  i havent gone to the movies with him in a while now. nothing much else to write except my birthday is here (almost).  im excited for it to come.  i still hope nothing goes bad.  bye bye everyone.  take care please. yours always :pathetic lilttle me::

          Hello, everyone. Today I spent the day with my sister, then my dad, then Daniel, and then my other sister.  It was interesting if you ask me.  With my sister I was on her computer the whole time.  I updated things, I deleted things she didn't need, and a whole other things she wanted.  With my dad I just sat there while him and my mom argued about what car too keep.  The only good thing was that I found ways to entertain myself there.  After that I got dropped off while my mom went to get some stuff from her friend.  I got ready and I went to Daniel's.  I love hangin' with him.  He makes me happy.  :).  His aunt scared the heck out of me today.  She just popped her head in the window.  Lol.  After that, I came home and watched t.v. with my other sister.  She's always, in some way, fun.  At around 10-ish, we came to the room and took more things out.  TOMORROW I START PAINTING AND STUFF!  Whoop, whoop!  :D!  Lol.  Well, that's it for today.  Bye, bye.  Take care. Yours Always, Debbie.

          Hello. Today was bleh day. I don't know why but I'm feeling like I use to like a month ago. It's like I have everything I need but I'm not happy. I know that something's that I want I can't have but eh, that's never broughten me this down before. I feel great but then I feel down. It's weird. It's like I'm amazingly happy because of I have everything I need and I found someone to be happy with. Yet I'm down because... I'm just down. I feel like there's something missing. I feel like crying yet I can't. AH! I hate confusement. It's only good when it's the funny kind and, believe me, this is not the funny kind. Better days. Bye, bye. Take care.   Yours Always,   Debbie.

          I'm back again.  :).  Here's something to give an update in my life. Hello everyone. Today I had an amazingly great day! I woke up and just tried to go on my computer when I recived a call. It was my good old friend, Carlos. We had planned to hang out with both Paul and Daniel. It ended up being only Carlos, Daniel, and I. It was great though. We had our laughs and good times, well, at least I did. We all went to eat together after a great Indian show. It was HIGH-larious! Lol. After eating we left to Uptown where we hung out, ate AMAZING ice cream, and then headed back to Daniel's house. Like 2 hours later, Carlos left and I didn't. I had an AMAZING time with Daniel. To tell you the truth, I love spending time with him. He makes me happy. :D! Well, anywho, we watched a lot of T.V. and stuff. Toward the end we ate pizza and then I had to leave. I didn't want to leave. :(. I guess that was the only bad thing about my day. Well that was my day, today. I thank Carlos and Daniel for it. Oh and just to keep people updated, I LOVE DANIEL! Your Always, ::Debbie::
