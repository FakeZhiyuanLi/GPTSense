      Hey have you been watching the news lately. If you have you probably heard about Governor MacGreevy's affair with a boy. He admitted that he was GAY! Some people say he is a great governor because he told the truth about himself, and others were shocked and didn't like it. Macgreevy dropped out from the job of governor. I think he is a verry good governor because he told his people the truth and was brave enough to pick up the topic. In other hand I was also shocked when I heard this and was un happy that New Jersey's governor is GAY!!!

      On Friday One of our friends from New Orleans. We were going to Niagra Falls. We headed out at 8:00. We drove for nine hours. The ride was very uncomfortable. We reached at about 4:00. The Motel that we stayed in was Budget Inns. The motel was close to the Falls. We saw the American Falls and it was mad big. On that same day we went on the Maid of the Mist boat ride. The boat went deep into the Horseshoe Falls and got really wet. After that we were heading home when we saw the a man who survived th Horseshoe Falls without protection. His name was Kirk Jones. He explaind why he did it. It was his intention to jump of the falls. Due to this action he was banned from Canada and was fined 5000 dollars. We went back to the hotel and came back at 11:00 to see the falls at night with the colors. The day finally ended. The next mourning we were going to go home. Our friends, my brother Anish, and I went to the Cave of the Winds. After that we went on the trolly and went to explore the Horseshoe for the American side, It was a great sight to see. Then we went to or motel and changed into somthing dry and were on our way back. As I have told you  the ride was unmfortable. When we reached home it was 12:00 A.M. We went strait to bed. This was a great trip for our friends and also for us. I encourage you to go some day too.

She helped me make Trinava's Lair too. Also My friend Neel came. He is Nima's cousin. We had lots of fun on that day. I hope she come again and stay a little longer!!

              I think that Kerry will win the election because his speech at the Democratic Convention was great. It was better than the other times he was involved in political events. I think that he got some pointers from Edwards.         George Bush already was president and did not do that of a good job. Also Bush new that there was going to be an attack in New York City, but he didn't take any action.         So thats why I think Kerry will win                                    Beware of my lair, you might get ensnared
