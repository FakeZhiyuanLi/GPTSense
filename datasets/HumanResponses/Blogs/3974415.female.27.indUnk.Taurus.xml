      I feel like I have been blessed beyond measure with the opportunity to re-live the 70s and witness the rhetoric surrounding the Vietnam saga. "I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty..." Oh, by the way, I served in Vietnam and have 3 purple hearts. Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam..... tax cuts! Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam.... strong national defense! Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam.... health care!  So.... besides stuff about Vietnam, what did you do in the Senate for the last 20 years? Oh, that's right... how could we forget? You voted on the balanced budget and worked on increasing the police force. So hopefully you know how a bill becomes a law by now... good, good, good....  You know Hillary and Bill... that's reassuring. And John Edwards is cute. Good choice. Can we do something about his wife? Can he have an affair or something? She's kind of too normal -- it's probably baby fat, but still.... And speaking of -- why the generational divide between their children? Did they forget how babies are made? Did they not like how the first one turned out? She seems nice enough. Did they  need some kids for the camera ? Poor woman. Now I feel for her. She's a baby-makin' machine for her husband's political aspirations. That's gotta suck. "What do you do?" "Oh, I wait for my husband to decide what he's going to do next, and then pop out a kid."  That's family values.  I'll tell you what family values is!! Family values is ridin' down the subway wich yo mama in yo bling bling.... catchin' yo ride to yo crib sayin while yo chillin'... "Yo, mama, where we be?" And havin' yo mama speak truth sayin', "Shut cho mouth, boy, where we goin'? To get me some mo bling bling up in heya."  Amen.  Hallelujah!  Praise Jesus and Reverend Al Sharpton!  And while we're at it, Jesse Jackson!  And MLK!  Go Democrats!  Vietnam, Civil Rights, and Unions.... That's some original material right there!

      Last night I had some of the worst dreams I've had in awhile.  I think it was because we watched "Amish in the City" and "Shark Week" back to back.   Consequently, I was at beaches I had never been to before and was watching people in shallow water being eaten by great whites.  It was horrible.  My stomach is still off this morning because of it.

      Today....    Today was a department meeting from hell.  From 1:00 to 4:00 we discussed the annual report for the department.  Great fun, let me tell you.      On a more interesting note, I found a musician I think I really like -- Mindy Smith.  She sounds somewhat like Alison Krauss, but more bluezy.  "Come to Jesus" is really good.    I missed yoga today, and that's frustrating, but I did have quality time with Reagan, and I'm making hamburger pizza for dinner.  MMMMMMMMMM - YUMMMMMMM    I've had a lot of weird thoughts throughout the day, but probably the most worthy is a new paper idea I'm working out in my head.  Jeff Weaver asked about Mayhew's notion of hiring leaders to take care of collective good problems in Congress due to all Members seeking personal reelection rather than institutional maintenance.  I answered that it made sense that those "hired" like Dennis Hastert were probably less marginal than other Members and thus in a better position to fulfill the task.  But I don't know that this has been tested.  So maybe I'll do just that.

      Sorry that everything I write is about my dream life, but it's really been active lately.    So last night I was in my grandmother's old house in Fort Walton Beach, and nobody was home except the little kid from the Sixth Sense and me.  The kid would wake up each morning and make stewed tomatoes... dump a can into a saucepan and heat it up till it was really boiling over, and then eat it.  All I remember is that this kid was really interested in finding out about me.  He asked me sincere questions.  I was supposed to go to this dance, and so I had asked a friend to take me, and the kid kept asking me whether I was excited about going, about getting dressed up, and about going with this friend.  I was none of the above, and rather felt it was an obligation for me to go.  The other thing that stood out in the dream that I remember is that the friend, though in the dream he was from highschool or college or something, was actually Jeremy White - one of my Jeremy's friends from Oklahoma.  I told the kid that I didn't trust him, that he was not a decent guy and had bad habits.  I was not looking forward to spending my time with him... and the kid didn't understand why I would have chosen to go with him.    The other dream I had involved my trip to Chicago.  I had left Pensacola and was in Charlotte catching a connection.  The stewardess and pilot were fighting with each other, so I decided to go to the bathroom and freshen up.  When I walked in there was an elderly man in the doorway, and when he saw me he looked at the sign and realized he was in the wrong restroom, and as he left I heard him say "I don't even care any more."  The sinks in the bathroom were full of poop - all of them except one.  I used that one to wet down my hair, and when I dried it in the hand drier it was perfectly straight and beautiful.  In the process of fixing my makeup with a broken applicator, my hand brushed a sink and got poop on it.  I freaked out and washed my hands really hard, and then left.  I realized I was late to catch the plane and began to run down the terminal.  At the gate I realized I hadn't checked in, and that my ticket actually was for the following week.  I was a week early and stuck in Charlotte.

      Last night was really really weird.  The whole night I slept really well, but had these dreams in which I felt extremely sad.  It was just waves and waves of sadness.  Most of it was feeling sad about seeing Jeremy's friends and having to decide how to handle the situation.  I still don't know what I'm going to do.  I feel like I need to be honest to myself, but on the other hand I don't want to estrange Jeremy from them any more than he already is.    That's all I feel like writing.

      Today I seem to be focused on figuring out what the meaning is of a whole bunch of dreams I've been having lately. I've looked on dreamdoctor.com (fun site), but most of them aren't mentioned in any way. So I'll just write about them and maybe things will come to me.    The first dream I had a few days ago. Jeremy and I were visiting or living with my parents in a house that I didn't recognize. The focus of the dream was this new red convertible. My parents had bought it and placed a big red bow on it in the middle of the night. My sister was asleep and my mother and I were awake (very unusual indeed), and we were trying to move the car into a better place outside for her to find it when she woke up. It was at this point that I realized the car wasn't for me. I was extremely jealous and angry. After helping my mom, I went to my room determined not to get up and join in the festivities in the morning with my sister. Morning came, and I did not join in, and my father was upset that I was in my room. He came upstairs to get me, but I didn't have any pajamas on, so I made him wait in the doorway for me to get dressed. I searched and searched for pajamas, but never could find anything decent. And then I woke up.     The second dream I had was last night. I was in a cold place, but not too cold... somewhere like Tennessee in the winter. There was some snow on the ground, but not a whole lot. I remember telling my friends that this was nowhere near what it was like in Wisconsin. All my friends were classmates from elementary school who had come together for some kind of reunion. I remember telling Brandy the story of my birthday when she ran into the glass door at 5 North Dr. I remember seeing Nathan Throckmorton and how shy he still was. We were in some kind of safari snow jeep thing. It was all going well until we had to climb this hill covered in black ice, and then we kept slip sliding all over the place and getting in the way of the other jeeps on this tour or trip with us. The only other scene I remember from this dream was in a school building. We had gathered for a guest lecture on atheism. My parents were there as well as all of these old classmates. The speaker showed up and at first looked like some earth mother. She started doing yoga stretches to "prepare" for the talk, but she was wearing a dress. So my mother told her that when she spread her legs we could see up her dress, and she might not want to do that in the front of the room. Then when she began her talk for some reason she had on this weird voodoo witch doctor mask and prayed in jibberish. When she tried to tell us what she had prayed, the band class in the next room piped up and we couldn't hear anything she was saying. Finally we decided to move outside, and we all lined up against this chainlink fence. She told me to sit down right where this frog had been hopping. So I did, and Nathan and I talked for awhile. That's all I remember.    The other dream I had last night involved this huge house -- looked more like the inside of Lowe's or Home Depot. The most striking feature of the house was this great big garden outside... it was more like a greenhouse with vegetables and flowers and ferns and all kinds of plants. I had inherited this house from some old lady who I didn't even really know. I had no idea how to care for all the plants, but I really thought they were neat and wanted this to be my new hobby. Finally Mary Ann and Jack Murphy came over with a team of gardeners and helped me learn how to care for the garden in the greenhouse. Then Jeremy's family (Paul and Shana, Heather, and Lily Beckers) came over to see the garden. They started picking all the vegetables and making a nice sample of everything to take home with them. At first I was upset, but then I started finding things to give them to take home. The final thing I remember was walking through the house for the first time - even though I had been there for days - and realizing that the other end of the house was this wonderful upscale fruit market with candles lit and music playing and perfect lighting and that the purpose of the house was to provide the produce for this small business... and then I realized it was also mine and it was so lovely... and I just started crying tears of joy.    Dreams... who needs 'em.  They just mess with your head.

      Reagan slept till 8:30 this morning. That's a miracle. When she woke up though she was absolute psycho puppy. Jeremy left to get breakfast, and she was fit to be tied. We have a very vocal dog. She barks and whimpers and yawns out loud. A lot of personality, this one.    Jeremy made me chicken and dumplings for dinner while I was sound asleep taking an afternoon nap. What an awesome surprise! We watched Aqua Teen Hunger Force and had a grand ole evening. Nathan Scott Phillips! Oh, if we could all have a pet snake.    I've gotta clean my house, and I have absolutely no desire to do so.  Gotta hate it.    Here's my wisdom for the day:   Ooey,Gooey Butter Cake          1 package yellow cake mix..I like Duncan Hines  1 stick of butter (melted)  1 egg    Mix all of the ingredients above and pat in a 13 by 9 inch pan      Topping    1 8 oz package of cream cheese (softened)   2 eggs   1 box of 10x(powdered) sugar    Mix cheese til light and fluffy, add eggs and mix well, then add box of powdered sugar. Beat till all of the lumps are completely gone.   Pour this mixture over cake in pan and bake at 350 for 30 to 45 minutes or until topping is golden... allow to cool.      If you save some confectioners sugar, you can sprinkle it over the top to make it look even more delectable...

      To love and be loved.  Is there anything better?    I was really having a sad-feeling day. There are lots of reasons, probably none of which I should share with cyberspace. Maybe when I get to know cyberspace better - start calling it cyb for short, then we'll talk.    Anyway, I digress...    I was feeling blue, and soooooo incredibly distant from my world around me, and I just needed a break from it all. And then my husband surprised me at work with flowers. No special occasion - just a day... a random day... and he thought of me.     Yes, there are still issues. Yes, I still feel blue... but I have a basket of flowers and a note that reminds me that my husband loves me and also still likes me just a little bit. :) Today's not so bad after all.

      Here is the first endorsement in for my book --     "During the past thirty years political scientists have sought to explain the behavior of members of Congress by assuming that  members are rational actors guided by a set of shared motivations - to gain election and reelection, to advance policy goals, and to further career ambitions.  Such explanations have tended to downplay the importance of variables such as gender or political party.  Jocelyn Jones Evans now offers the most thorough study to date of the role of gender and party in shaping the behavior of members of Congress.  Drawing upon both quantitative and qualitative evidence, she argues that both gender and party affect member behavior.  Furthermore, she offers an explanation of how these variables relate to explain the differing experiences of female Republicans and female Democrats.  Her findings will command the attention of congressional scholars and chart a direction for future research."    -- Ronald M. Peters, Jr., Regents' Professor of Political Science, University of Oklahoma

      I don't know why I thought of this book this morning, but since I was thinking I thought I would share. &nbsp; Gary&nbsp;Chapman has written a book called  The Five Love Languages .&nbsp; Its premise is that we each give and receive love in unique ways. He identifies five particular "languages" as examples:&nbsp;gifts, acts of service, quality time, words of affirmation, and physical touch.&nbsp; Many couples don't understand this principle and spend years feeling unloved because of miscommunication rather than a lack of effort.&nbsp;  &nbsp; For example, if the primary love language I speak is quality time, but my spouse only hears acts of service, then he could interpret my messy house as a lack of love for him - even though we spend all our spare time together having "quality time."&nbsp; In contrast, if I hear physical touch (sounds like an oxymoron), but my spouse speaks words of affirmation, then I could spend the rest of my life feeling insufficient and unattractive even though he tells me every day how much he loves me. &nbsp; I actually got a lot out of this book.&nbsp; More than anything, I think I realized how different we each are and how important open communication in every language is with your spouse in order to have a fulfilling relationship. &nbsp; That's hard.&nbsp; You're mad; you don't feel important to your spouse, but yet you have to be open to physical touch?&nbsp; words of affirmation? acts of service?&nbsp; That sucks.&nbsp; Let's just say that learning this principle has kept me busy for years.

      I will rejoice   I will rejoice  and be glad in it  and be glad in it....    Good morning, world.  It's 7:00, and my dog has defecated.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  You know - dogs are funny animals.  If one thing is out of place or different in their small world, they are fit to be tied.  I can relate.  I've never been able to truly communicate what's it's like to someone to be OCD, but then I watch my dog want more than life itself for the bedroom door to be open as usual - and I can relate.  If I'm out of "good drinks" - diet soda of any variety perfectly chilled in the refrigerator - when I wake up, then watch out buddy... somebody's gonna get it.     It's humbling to me this morning that the Lord made today.  It's not yesterday, and it will not be repeated tomorrow.  It may rain, but the rain will be uniquely different today.  What am I going to do with July 20, 2004?    Well, for one, I'm going to get Aqua Teen Hunger Force, volume 2.  I've been waiting for a month for it to come out so that I can watch the Nathan Scott Phillips episode.  If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on some quality programming.  (11:00 on Adult Swim - Cartoon Network)    For two, I'm going to puppy class this evening to train my dog to not do all of her tricks at the same time.  How embarrassing is it when your dog is so smart that she does everything you have ever asked her to do at the exact same time so as not to waste time in getting a treat?    For three?  I'm going to give a riveting lecture on Elections and District Design to my Legislative Process class -- trying to hold their attention for a full three-and-a-half hours.  Good luck to me.

      This is my first blog.  I'm trying it out because I largely don't understand the phenomenon of blogging.  Where have all the journals gone?      I figure it provides some kind of release for a good number of people, and since I stay fairly stressed out it might be beneficial.  We'll see.

      just a few months ago, i remember telling our office manager how strange i found it to be that she would actually purchase a car on ebay.  who does that?  that's crazy!  you've never actually seen the car; you have no idea if they are being honest with you; and yet you send thousands of dollars through "pay pal" to an unknown identity in exchange for a hypothetical vehicle you have to travel hundreds of miles to go get.  that's crazy!  and yesterday i bought a car on ebay.  it's what i've always wanted - exactly. ... little black sports car with a sunroof, great sound system, stick shift, dark tint, leather interior, v6 engine.  i'm thrilled.... but it is in austin, texas.  i've gotta wait 2 weeks to go pick it up.  bummer.  Here is a  urlLink picture ... if you're interested.

      last night as i was drifting off to sleep i started thinking about my relationship with my puppy.  it occurred to me that in her life i am this big person -- this person that provides for her and loves on her and plays with her... that even when she is frustrated about something or lonely i am there to comfort her.  even if i can't change it, i can still comfort her.   that made me feel really good to be able to provide that for her and really sad all at the same time.  i started thinking about how nice it would be to have a tangible figure in my life that had the same relationship with me.  i know that i have my husband, and we do love each other and comfort each other... but somebody bigger.  it would be nice to have God physically here sometimes... wouldn't it?  to provide for us and love on us and play with us.... to comfort us by giving us a hug and sitting with us as long as we needed it.  i know i sound sappy this morning, but i've just been thinking about how nice it might be to have a dog's life for a day.  to eat, sleep, poop, play, and give puppy kisses all day long.  reagan's sweet, and we are very happy to claim her.  it is a good morning.
