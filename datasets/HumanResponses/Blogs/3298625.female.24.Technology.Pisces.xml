      The first time:) Saturday, May 15th, 2004   Hello one and all,  no not that first time, first time on blog;)  I have always wanted to have a blog but.. been kinda lazy, so now I have started however I do not promise to update everyday. lol.  So anyway I'm in the states (incase you were wondering)I go to a college called waldorf in Forest city Iowa. Iowa nuff said, forest city is tiny, extremely tiny, however this is where they make the world famous winnebagos. yeah so atlest there something happening... lol.  I miss my family in Tanzania, so much but in two years I will have my degree and it had better be worth it otherwise I will tear it up.  So it is saturday today nothing planned, but on friday night I had some japanese food, okonomiyaki, it is a japanese pizza great stuff, some friends and I made it, ok, ok, so they made it and I watched.. had some green tea and a sort of saki that girls drink on 'girls day' in japan. Don't ask. anyway I lan to make them so pilau next weekend that should be fun. hopefully it will turn out ok.  anyway now I gotta go back to bed it 7:08 AM for heavens sake.

      I know I said I wouldn't update everyday but don't begrudge be this one time :)  Today, I went to the library and picked up two books, a Johanna Lindsey and Cathy Maxwell, then came back read the Johanna Lindsey then slept woke up made some chicken strips and now I have to write 4 papers, one on pro-choice for women, dying as a public affair (euthanasia and PAS), on illegal immigrants; humanitarianism or national interest, and ecology. Yeah I have quite a night a head of me. If and when I finish I will then go on to my business class homework, decision making and creativity. Dear reader I am not creative at all. Then I think I will do some laundry and clean up my room. That should be fun. Soemone tell me if a pro-choice stand contradicts feminism.. I am lost here...  Had dinner grilled cheese sandwiches made by Lindsay, on her new machine and cokes provided by me yee.. so later. Is there 'the one'? I wonder.. if there is, where is he?  Oh well one of those questions... nite nite...

      Okay is there anyone out there who is actually an exceptionally good kisser? I mean don't I know how? okay a new guy came into town, one I hadn't seen in ages, and wam he kissed me... it was short but not at all very impressive. I admit to trying it out and seeing how it was when it wasn't all that stopped it.. that was evil.. but hey it has been a while and a girl has needs and ohh kissing is such a need..;) I think I will take kissing classes, I&nbsp; believe there is an art to kissing and if done right shit could be the most erotic things ever. Actually as I am writting this I have discovered what was wrong with his guys kissing.. for him kissing isn' just kissing it is a way to get a girls cloths off. I think when it is that guys don't pay all that much attention to it and then they miss all the signs that the girls give, like slow down or lets do the nibbling or maybe lets make it a dance. Am I putting way too much emphasis on kissing? mhhh I think not. I mean afterall it is kissing for heavens sake.. give it as much emphasis as you can. LOL.  My first kiss to a guy I was heads over heals for to&nbsp;this day remains one of the most erotic kisses ever, I will try to explain how it happened.&nbsp; it was around 11 at nighton august 3rd 1997 I believe, it was his birthday and from me he asked for only one thing a kiss.&nbsp; This guy had loved me for 3 years without any reciprocity from me.:( anyways, he was slightly taller and when he saw me he knew I had finally agreed and he didn't say a word he took me in his arm and when his lips touched mine, the magic started. It was a dance, when I withdrew he came in for me and when he withdrew I went in for him and then right on top of each other there was suction but not like suction.. get it?&nbsp; The rest of the world seriously evaporated, I didn't hear anything, I saw fireworks, literally maybe it was in my head since my eyes were closed but damn it was good.&nbsp; and then my first serious boyfriend he knew where my limits were and so he would never push the line and his kisses were addictive like literally, and I remember he would drink redbull and then uhhh... he would tatse like, ohhhh &nbsp;I don't know what but it rocked my world.  Since then I haven't met any guys who kiss just to kiss you. Oh yeah there was another one&nbsp;but&nbsp;I think I &nbsp;have told enough kissing escapades don't you think... and he eventually destroyed it but wanting to go further LMAO.. why do they do that?  later

      Okay, no ones awake but the net so hear goes... &nbsp;   Isn't it ironic that right after I talk about my list I actually think I am falling in love, and the person is so not my type. we are going to 'nip this in the bud'. I think he is right in everyway characterwise however there other stuff.&nbsp; maybe it is the idea of a new person, the discovery of a new mind that I find so overwhelming and perhaps thats what I am confusing with love who knows. Please God I know you are reading this, let it not be love. He has a girlfriend, this will be my chant whnever I see him, whenever we are together, or anything along those lines I will chant that he has a girlfriend over and over so my wandering mind wil not have the opportunity to wander.:) ohh he suprised me today when he remebered that he got me(inside joke) anyways I simply remembered that he got couldn't remember how and he remebered everything. and now for the reality check,.. he has a great memory there is no hidden meaning it is all in your head. that was when I actually noticed him like seriously when he remembered that. SHIT. and then he said he would play if I did, darn it I am in deep shit. I gotta find me a man. any single nice guys out there hear my call and answer.    I don't think he will fit in with my friends, plus we have very different styles of watching movies. He does so in silence, I kinda do but I express myself. okay lets talk about somethng else the more we talk about this guy the more I am going to fall in infatuation with him.   oh well 1 week without seeing him should do it (the logic behind being, out of sight out of mind) hope this stuff works. and when I do see him it will be for short occurances. 10 min tops no chance to impress me with his oh so brilliant mind.   See you in a week, hopefully completely over this guy.:)

      So it has been a while, there are a few times I wanted to do this but wasn't not able to for some reasons. There was this one time where I had a dream was so perfect I wanted to write it down but I didn't, and yes the dream had to do with a guy. one that was perfect. Oh I remember this other thing that I thought I should write down, the entertiment we have here in Iowa. The other day me and my beloved friends Angelika and her son Amos went to  watch fireflies over corn fields, it was trully great, but that the entertiement we have here in Iowa. anyways later.
