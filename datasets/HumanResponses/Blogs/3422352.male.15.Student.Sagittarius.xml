      If your wondering how this got it's name, 'Behind the Sun' was a song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I beleive that it talks about how evil and corrupt the world still is and how inhumane we are. 'Behind the Sun' was also a book written by Hillel Slovak, the first guitarist of Red Hot Chili Peppers. He was also Anthony(singer)'s best friend.  Hillel tragically died from a heroine overdose in 1988, the year I was later born. 'Under the Bridge' was written to commemorate his death.  I am very interested in Hillel. In all of the band's pictures he looks so distant. He was a magician on guitar and a very talented musician elsewhere. He encouraged Flea to start playing the Bass Guitar, and actually taught him some of it. He could also play Sitar, which I hear takes a lot of skill to play.  John Fruscante (current guitarist) used to go and watch the Chili Peppers. They were his favorite band. He joined the band when he was 19 and braught them fame and glory.  So, that's how this part of the site got it's name...

       God Bless America... Me and Sam were all kitted out for the Chili Peppers in cardiff: T-shirts, gloves and graffiti upon our arms. We couldn't contain ourseleves and had to keep ourselves occupied on the long journey to cardiff by eating unhealthy amounts of sweets and waving to people we didn't know. We finally got there at about 5:20pm. We'd had to walk when the 'park + ride' bus dropped us off halfway to the stadium. We walked around the stadium to gate one and went in. Chicks on Speed were about 1/3 of the way through their set, and thank god we hadn't gotten in earlier, they were terrible. They were wierd techno-space furturistic crap, and they probably were on speed. Tonnes of plastic bottles were redirected from the bins to the 'Chicks' faces, and at the end, they said we were the best audience they'd had!!!  Half an hour later James Brown and his band came onstage and were surprisingly good. He performed a few of his classics and some funky stuff that everybody got down to (especially a bald guy who had a metre long spliff). Then everything went quiet. James Brown and his band went offstage and the guys started setting up the stage for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' set. They had a walkway round the back of Chad's drumkit and four massive screens on either side of the stage.   Then everything went black, the lights went out and suddenly Flea (bass), John (guitar) and Chad (drums) were on the stage! An amazing sound shook the stadium, it was undescribable. I knew this was going to be good. A new clean-cut John sliced through the monstrous bass sound of Flea with the simplistic but skillful sound of his guitar. Chad Smith was playing better than I'd ever heard before and everyone loved it. After the opening song, Anthony (vocals) came onstage from the left in three quarter lenghts and a school blazer. He had grown his hair to about shoulder length.  They started the set with 'Can't Stop' and played a number of songs from 'Calafornication', simplistic stuff like 'Emit Remmus' and 'I Like Dirt' and of coarse the classics, 'Under the Bridge' and 'Calafornication' iself were also played. There were a number of solos and jamming sessions involved which included a new song which they had written recently. To end the set, they played 'Give it Away' the song in which they trashed the drumkit and started getting a bit crazy: Flea wearing one of Chad's symbols on his head while playing bass and Anthony barely balancing on the loose Bass-Drum whilst singing.(He fell off a couple of times).   We left with a buzzing in our ears and an experience that both of us will never forget. Thankyou Red Hot Chili Peppers!!

      Guitar... what a creation. It could save me from "the brink of emptiness"... Almost every guitar player, picks up a guitar to look cool. I admit it. I did. But something strange is happening. I am beginning to realise something more. More about me. A guitar isn't just a fret-board with the capability of producing sounds. It is a way of communicating a wide variety of emotions to a listener without the need for words. The same can be said for all musical instruments, although some can represent more emotions than others might. A song can give the listener an idea, make them think from another viewpoint, reflect an emotion the listener might've had, it could be almost anything. We shouldn't take any kind of music for granted. I dosn't matter about what their image is. It is the relationship between the listener and the song which is important. Some people don't understand, or choose to ignore this fact when choosing who to like and who to dislike. I like the 'Red Hots' because they reflect a part of me. I can't explain it with words what makes them so special to me. I'm almost certain that Sam feels the same way about them... I really hope I can  get the band together and do the performance. Not so we can look cool and be popular (that's just an added bonus), but so I can share a peice of me with everyone else and help people realise who I am.

      Tommorow begins the last week of year ten. In seven weeks (not including work experience) we will be in year eleven, our final year. Oh God. I'd like to act cool and say: "YYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!," but I don't at all feel like doing that. I don't want to lie to myself that I am pleased to be leaving school in just one year. I am seriously scared...  What will I do? I just want to stay in school and play guitar and mess about with my friends and continue to try and chat up nice girls. Now I have to fit it all in to one year before my life begins to decompose.  You never realise how good you've got it until you lose it. The trouble is all I can do is get on with it. The weekends away from you all get longer and longer, and my weekends with you get shorter and shorter.  I have a preminition that my life as a guitarist will all go to pot, and I'll just become somekind of washout. I want to die young and free, instead of old and bored. I would want to comit suicide if it all didn't work out well, but the problem is that I couldn't do that to myself. I'd just be watching my life tick away, sitting in my chair. Watching young people enjoying their lives, through a pain of glass. I'll just be sitting there, rotting away.  I've never talked to anyone about Sophie W except to Badge. I really like her, but I can't say anything to her for fear of rejection. I kind of know I'll be rejected as soon as I say anything. She only cares about the other guys like T.J and Zach and so on. She told me herself. She probably just thinks I'm a dufous compared to those guys. I'm so immature and stupid for falling for her of all people. It may seem like I like her for obvious reasons, but that's not true. Anyone who says that is just jealeous. She is a genuinely nice person. I only have one year left though, so I might aswell tell her. You can tell her if you really want, I don't care anymore. I have nothing to hide. When you're telling her though, just think of me and what you are doing to me. What have I done to anyone to deserve that? Just think about that. I am a PERSON with FEELINGS, not just some geek that no-one likes.  I'm just afraid that I will spend the rest of my life regretting what I didn't do for fear of rejection, when I had nothing to lose anyway...

      Finally... (as Mel Gibson once said),FREEDOM!!! I have quit my paper round. So I'm free. Free to do what I want any old time. Someone invite me to a party or band practice. I'm so high :) "on what?" I hear you ask. I'm high on life, that's what!!! I don't want anything to change. I love the world and everything and everyone. I LOVE EVERYTHING!!!!  Today I watched the best film in history ever to be made ever ever: 'The Crow' starring Brandon Lee (Bruce Lee's son). Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) is a guitarist for a band (Hangman's Joke) who has fallen in love. He and his partner Shelley are soon to be married, when they are both brutally murdered (Eric thrown out of a window, six storeys high and his girlfriend beaten and raped). Eric dies instantly, while Shelley holds on in hospital for another 30 hours before giving it up.  The two were very in love, though. The love between them is enough to bring Eric back to the 'material' world as an indestructable being. His lifeforce is bound to that of a crow (A symbol of death). He comes back to avenge the death of Shelley, by killing the people who raped and killed her. Only then can he rest peacefully.  Don't want to spoil it, though. I advise anyone to see it, rent it or whatever.

      My God. By the end of the London trip, we had spent 13 hours on the bus, and about two hours at the gallery. I did one measeley sketch (which wasn't that good anyway) and then got lost. I'll write some more later. Sarah is kicking me right now telling me to add her to my 'friends' list. maybe, in time...

      Oh hell. Perry's makin us go to goddam blists hill so we can draw stuff...boring... then later in the week, we got goddam sports day, then to top it all, we're not going to a theme park this year. Goddam it. Sports day is so crappy. The school makes everyone do it and for what, humiliation. That's what. We don't raise any money for anyone, not even the school and no one watches it apart from the whole school. People's social lives (including mine probably) are at risk for the sake of some crappy school event. }:( I feel sick just thinking about it. They're going to have to drag me if they want me to do anything at all, and I'm not bringing my kit. I don't care how severely punished I get, I'm not doing anything. I hope they've got some reserves. The art trips'll be alright, apart from the London one which we have to be at school for 7:30am and will arrive back at 9:00pm (or something like that.) I think I'll just go and slit my wrists a few hundred times and hang myself and shoot myself and decapetate myself and walk heavy-footedley into a 1,000,000 acre minefeild, then off a cliff into the icy sea with lazor guided sharks with drills for teeth in it and freeze and drown and fall into a coffin and get buried alive and get eaten by maggots and then be reborn as a fly and get squashed by a gay guy, dressed in just an apron.   v. pissed off

      Green Heaven   About this planet, there is something I know There's a very big difference between above and below A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow  Here, above land, man has laid his plan And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan We got a government so twisted and bent Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution And that's a heart felt shame 'Cos everyone's crazy, everyone's the same So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?  Time now to take you to a different place Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none 'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun No one tells 'em how their life is run And no one points at them with a gun They have a lot of love for every living creature The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you  Back to the land of the police man Where he does whatever he says he can Including hating you because you're a Jew Or beating black ass, that's nothing new Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail So support your police, support your local wars That's the way to open economic doors Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore We assume the position to sell the ammunition What the fuck? It's the american tradition Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?
