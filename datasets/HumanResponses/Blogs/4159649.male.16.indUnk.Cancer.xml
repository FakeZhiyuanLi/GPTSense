      Hey ppl was up this is my first actual entry besides Lily's ...So yeah my weekend kicked ass .. First I got picked up by my dad and then we went to pick up Maria ..... Shortly after picking her up , we went to Miami Beach where my family was .... Maria and I changed and went off to the beach....At like around 9 went off home to homestead and fell alseep around 3 to 5 in the morning wrapped around my babe MARIA..Woke up at 10:30 and went back to the hotel, spent the whole day swimming with Maria (which was fun) Then on Monday I got up and made Maria brunch which was good.. We watched TV the whole day and wrestled a little of course I won .... Or did I ? lol ..That was pretty much my kick ass weekend ... Now IM in Lily's house updating my blog .. and then shortly after this post goes up I will be heading home where I will lay in bed listening to slipknot's duality CD which gets me so depressed and miserable so yeah..... Life for me sucks unless maria's around so yeah I love u babe........ Well Laters ( feel free to leave comments)
