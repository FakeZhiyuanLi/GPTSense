      TBS is running this new series called Outback Jack.  They take a bunch of women, women who have been screened down to the biggest prima donnas who can't last outside a city with high-end salons and hotels, and drop them out of a plane into the Australian Outback to compete for an Australian guy named Jack.   Seriously, that's the premise of the show.  The saddest part is: I'm hooked.  I missed the first episode, but having gotten through 3/4 of the second show I find myself looking forward to the next episode. In my own defense, I enjoyed the stuff about what the Outback is really like. OK, I like the petty fighting among the women too, and checking out Jack. For one thing, he's pretty cute.  ...and his accent rocks!  Is this really what we've sunk to - watching other people's love lives played out in a completely unrealistic setting?

      I'm finally done with the inspection process.&nbsp; Last week I walked through the house with a home inspector, who found various issues including evidence of a mouse infestation.&nbsp; I submitted my list of things I wanted taken care of before closing, including bringing in an exterminator.&nbsp;   Boy, did she bring in an exterminator!&nbsp; She apparently spent $4000 on an exterminator.&nbsp; They told her they'd need 8 hours with no one in the house, which they used, and they were back the next day to finish the job.&nbsp; They replaced&nbsp;all of the insulation from the attic because it was infested, with rats.&nbsp; EEW!&nbsp; She even went so far as signing up for 6 months of monthly checkups by the exterminators to be sure they don't come back, and she won't even be living there in 2 months!   After finishing that and bringing in a roofer to inspect the roof and tell me she pressure washed it and that's why it looks unusually worn in a few spots, we've agreed on a set of things she'll take care of or give me a credit off the purchase price for.&nbsp;   I've got my insurance taken care of, so all that's left is to finish the loan process.&nbsp; It's a month minus a day from when I'll take possession, can't wait!

      Ever since I moved here almost 4 years ago I've been living in a 1BR apartment "temporarily."&nbsp; I didn't buy any nice furniture or decorations because it didn't make sense to spend $$ on furniture meant for an apartment I wouldn't be in for long.&nbsp; Ha ha, the joke's on me, I've been living like a college student all this time for it.  &nbsp;  Those days are done&nbsp;- a few months ago I decided to bite the bullet and start looking for a house.&nbsp; A permanent, all-mine, no-shared-walls house.&nbsp;&nbsp; I eventually got an agent and started looking at houses and this past week I found it.&nbsp; Split entry, with finished daylight basement, deck, 3BR, and more than twice the square footage than my dinky little apartment.&nbsp; I put an offer on it and it was accepted that night!&nbsp; So, come the end of August (which, coincidentally is my birthday) I close on my first house!  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;    I now have a packed schedule of things I need to do to make sure I'm not screwing myself - deadlines for contingencies, applying for loans and insurance, review paperwork on the house...&nbsp; Having only been through the process of simply offering to buy the house, I'm already dumbfounded at the amount of paperwork it takes to do this.&nbsp; Saying "can I buy your house" took 25 pages alone!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Stay tuned for more on my adventures in moving...
