      My mum got a phone call from her sister { My Aunty }, saying that their mum { My Gran } was in hospital, because of  she has heart attack on the Wednesday, my mum rang up the hospital, and ask is her mum ok, they said "yes she is doing ok and she is able to talk to you if you want". My mum was pleased she was able to talk to her mum, my gran seems to be ok and she will be having a scan for her head, to see anything from there that might have caused the heart attack. My mum will ring to find out more information.   babydragon x

      Today was not bad, just a quiet day.  Had my friend over, we just listened to music and chilled out.  After that, just went food shopping with my mum.  I want to die my hair red, but a red that will show/stand out since I have natural colour black hair, while shopping with my mum I was just looking around, maybe in a few weeks I will do it and get a picture.  Nothing interesting at the moment.    babydragon

      Ok, I went to my ECDL class this morning, and just got told there is a NEW Module...... *breathes in and out* WHY ? Why 8 Modules. There's me thinking I kicked 5 modules ass's and I now have THREE more modules, NOT two, oh well, just have to do them. The paper sheets for this Module 8 has the answers to them which is no help to me, I want to learn without the answers in my face, just have to get my mum to ask me the questions without me looking.   Just got a phone call from o2, saying I can get more out of my phone, I listened, I hardly understand what the woman was saying and it seemed it went on for every. Why don't they listen when you say I am busy { I wasn't really }.   babydragon x

      Yesterday was fun.   Had another session of sports, we played rounders and then unihoc, which was great because my friends ankle healed enough for her to play. Lots of fun.    I got some great news I have received today and a few days ago. I am not going to mention till it happens : D but if it does happen it will be brilliant.     babydragon x
