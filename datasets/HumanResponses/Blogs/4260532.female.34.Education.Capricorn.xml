      So there is all this talk about "being in the moment," what is that all about? to live in this moment, where did this philosophy and/or approach come from... how and where did this become influencial in my life... what names and/or categories does it within?  GESTALT Theory.... this guy Fritz Perls and others developed this psychotherapeutic approach in the 1940’s... using this holistic approach...  "Perls’ basic premise was that life happens in the present – not in the past or the future – and that when we are dwelling on the past or fantasizing about the future we are not living fully. Through living in the present we are able to take responsibility for our responses and actions. To be fully present in the here and now offers us more excitement, energy, and courage to live life directly."  urlLink http://www.gestalt.on.ca/new_page_one.html   Hell if I knew where this thread of knowing went.... so this is just something to chew on...

        It’s a beautiful day on Cheyenne River where the people are smart and funny, where they gather the first weekend in September to whoop it up with carnival rides and cotton candy…. where the best of show of cucumbers to photography can be seen all day long…. where there are play days, fun runs, and floats with beautiful Native people all bright and shiny…. where the cowboys come to ride late into the night and cars are backed up past Chinatown to see the fancy feather dancers strut their stuff…. where horseshoes and softballs are pitched with pride and jackets on the line…where dancing feet are seen all over town, in boots on the street and in moccasins on the grass…where each year the weather comes in different guises - hot, cold, wet, dry, windy, calm – unpredictable and unaffected… where they cook up taniga, hotdogs and funnel cakes for your dining pleasure… where no matter where you have wandered, come Fair Time you can always find yourself back on Cheyenne River.

      Assurance and doubt are they mutually exclusive concepts...??  I am assured that I am doing the best for me, that I am strong and clear as to what my choices are, what circumstance I am in the midst of at this particular time and space.  I am doubtful that I know anything at all, I am doubt ful of this confidance in the choices I have made. I am doubtful that I am without blemish, this I am sure of.  People need to talk, need to look and talk about what other people have to say, to stand in judgement and hold themselves in higher regard. "I would never do such a thing! I am above that, I am right and she is wrong. They are bad and awful and full of trangressions. They are bad and full of evilness and must be repelled away from this true and righeteous state. "  I am sad to be in this spot. Sad right now anyhow, sad to know that for this moment in time I and my choices are the subject of idle gossip.  Insulation. Constant reassurance and clarification and open dialogue within myself about what matters, about who I am, about what is what, about where I am going, about what I am doing, about who is who and where I've been.  I see with different eyes really. A new place of justification ... "you don't have to justify anything to anybody." Easier said than done.  Social institutions and rules to keep thee in check. To hold up as the right and wrongs in the world, in this world. No matter the actions. Actions tell us all. We are called to be observers. Then we have a choice. To judge or not.

      leave like children swing in groups outside my window switching spots and playing jumping games twisting turning spinning swirling little people on the wind

       waited for 8 minutes for the pilot car north and south on Hwy 63 this morning .... followed it and watched the TREX remove half of a hill.... a landmark really... a landmark from my childhood, when i used to travel 1.5 hours from eagle butte to mclaughlin to swim twice a week one whole summer... that hill was all we could see for miles and we knew once we went around it, that we'd had reached our destination.... THE INDOOR SWIMMING POOL.... (where incidently, I vividly recall learning to swim out of fear of being dunked by the big kids).  don't 'cha love the smell of the earth... it is a distinct smell ...  rich and alive...   the earth under this new road is white and brown and black - what makes these colors?      urlLink http://http://www.sddot.com/Operations/construction_report/mobrdpjt.htm
