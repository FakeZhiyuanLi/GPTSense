      Hundreds already dead, civilians told to flee, us to invade with marines, watch the deathtoll soar, I had done a long article with links and all, but had problem when I went to post, cant do it all again, _____ Iraq American forces urged civilians to evacuate the combat zone in Najaf on Tuesday, the sixth day of clashes with Shiite militias that have restricted output from southern Iraqi oil fields and sent world oil prices soaring.  .  U.S. troops in Humvees drove through the center of the Shiite city, using loudspeakers to call on civilians to evacuate the zone immediately.  .  Residents said it was the first time U.S. troops had called for a mass evacuation, adding that they feared a massive attack on the Mahdi Army of the radical cleric Moktada al-Sadr in the city's cemetery, and on the shrine of Imam Ali, one of Shiite Islam's holiest sites.  .  Artillery and tank shells earlier pounded positions in the vast cemetery. A thick column of smoke rose from near the Imam Ali shrine, and Iraqi police in trucks were seen heading for the area while U.S. helicopters flew overhead.  .  A senior U.S. military official said Monday that marines had been given permission to enter the Ali shrine to attack the militants, and that any action taken would be "on the order and direction of the governor."  .  On Monday, Sadr vowed to "defend Najaf until my last drop of blood" and rejected calls by interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi for his men to lay down their arms and leave the city." _________   from www.iht.com  _________________________  Back later to keep this story alive,

      Afternoon,  Just a quick moan as I sit on my fifth floor office with a great view of Dublin city. There is a massive fire just beyony my line of site, buildings etc in my way, however there has been a steady stream of thick greyish smoke billowong far across the city, soomething like a sceen from Iraq and do you think I can find out what the hell it is. on the net for over an hour trying any Irish news and radio sites and still can not find a dam this on what caused the fire or what was even on fire, I suppose I will get it on the evening news.  Not very impressed with how Irish companies have not yet invested in the Internet in any big way, oh well maybe there will be some improvements going forward,  (could even be a carrer change on the horizon :)  )  end of rant.

      I have a real and immediate concern for Italy being the next target for a BIG attack from al-Qaeda. I expect in the same mold as the march attacks in Madrid.  I've just read this article on a website (abovetopsecret, excellent site), regarding the latest threat to Italy.  Link to article and plenty of comments  urlLink http://www.terroranalysis.com/story/71455.html  ___________________________________________________________________ The Deadline set by al-Qaeda has passed and this threat has been received....  quote: On Ubay Hfs 's battalions compact : the end of the deadline to the Italian nation On the compact of its source The In the Name of Allah Most Gracious Most Merciful Ubay Hfs 's battalions the Egyptian The Al-Qaeda Network To the Italian nation ... The peace on the one(s) who followed the guidance and after ... The end of the deadline that was defined for you and to your government with the withdrawal of its forces to a relative, and we will see if you were being characterized by the wisdom so that you take the decision of the withdrawal from Iraq, or then the bloody war in its way to you, and we will not stop the raids about Rome, and you will not feel the safety in your houses, then each place will become a goal after the end of the deadline, and will complete targeting any place, and the goals defined, and remained that the deadline that was issued in a first last month ends .. Our cells in Rome and in remainder Italian cities have prepared their equipment and any power will not dissuade us about hitting your strongholds, and we will transfer your life to a hell it is not tolerated, if you did not withdraw from the Muslim country, Iraq . The mocking at the Islamic civilization will not pass below a punishment, and your nation will not enjoy O Brliscony is with the safety except if the Iraqi nation felt the safety when you withdraw from their country .. And that changed then our hitting will head for each place in every age .... Until your getting out of Iraq land .. To our cells in the Italian cities ... The war has approached therefore that mobilize you all to the fierce war after the end of the deadline that was defined, you got ready for hitting any target that waves in front of you after the end of the deadline that was defined ... So that we make taste Brliscony and his group the bitterness of the blood that made taste him to the Iraqi nation, after they chose the mean following Bush, and the mean is Blair .. And he who wronged will know any return they turn back Ubay Hfs 's battalions the Egyptian The Al-Qaeda Network Saturday 21 / 6 / 1425 hijri - 7 / 8 / 2004 ______________________________________________________________________  As stated there are a lot of comments also but I have not included them here, just the chilling quote from the group, follow the link to view the discussion.  I am more concerned about the immediate threats to Italy as opposed to Ney York which was also mentioned, (we have been getting blitzed about the threats to the US and most have been just scaremongering and playing politics with terror alerts. I expect later this year closer to the election there will be a spectacular attack on the US.)  I think al-Qaeda will feel they were very successful in getting Spain to leave Iraq, Madrid bombings saw to that, and you saw the public response. Sack the Gov go with anti-war party/pull out troops. The Al-Qaeda will see this success as a blueprint for all European countries who it has targeted. (I also think they are fully aware of the European citizenry opposition to this illegal war and hence this is a good strategy).  For me Italy is more in danger in the shortterm than say the UK or the US, though I do not rule and attack on either out altogether. The next few weeks will be telling,  I do hope I am completely wrong and this is just more rhetoric.  Garlo

      I have not blogged in a while, thought id just do a quicky,  Watching the News Over the last couple of days, and we continue to see constant terror alerts/arrests and developments in Iraq.  In Iraq have things have kicked of again with Al Sadr and his army, there have been a huge number of deaths on both sides and it looks like it will continue. I also believe they have declared war on the British down south in Basra.  Basra has been relativley quiet and more stable than Baghdad or Najaf, and certainly more secure than fallujah.  This could be a worrying trend with the resistence controlling large parts of the country be it that we dont see such reports in the media, Iraq would begin to resemble Afghanastan. Watch this space I am sure there will be  more to post on this issue.   Garlo btw football season is started back today, our year this year i hope (LIVERPOOL are  my team)

      Just got home from work, caught the news, live bush news conference to announce a new intel tzar (or director as he puts it).  I just caught the Q & A at the end of his announcement and obvuiousley they were about Iraq and the lies he went to war on.  didnt catch the question but the answer was class. He still maintains he would have gone to war regardless of the false intel, WHAT, he believes he was still right to go to war and keep mentioning links with TERROR, joke ."The world IS abetter place with saddam hussain not in power, ". I am sure GOD told him as they do communicate regularly  you know.    Has he not just decided to have a new drug tzar exactley because the 911 commision has recemended such due to the false intel. the commision has clearly stated there were not links between UBL & Saddam, they hate each other for god sake.  As he was speaking, there was breaking news about guess what, *ELEVATED TERROR STATUS* in new  york & washington, this goes to what I was sayin in my other post today, (see below). New York Cheif of Police was explaining all the restrictions and new security plans.  Bush is dellusional, I have also read reports latly of him being on strong anti-depressants , hes loosing it ,  worrying since it is his finger on that dredded red button  oh where will it all end, enough for now will post more on these issues in the days n weeks to come,  Garlo

      This being my first proper post, I will be serious.  Its summer 04 and we are in the run up to the elections in the old US of A. There is or it seems to me anyway a hugh ammount of scaremongering going on  all over the Mainstream Media.  Stories about Threats, percieved Threats and the like. UK gov has just releases its onw pamphlet on what to do  "if" those peskey terrorists come calling, no we are getting near daily, wall to bloddy wall, the terrorists are coming , we just dont know when or where.  The American gov has got to be the worst offender, this admin is run on fear. Just look at the Homeland Security website to understand what I mean--  http://www.ready.gov/  I predict here in my first proper post the good ol dubbeya (GWB) will be saved in the nic of time and be re-elected due to a massive 911 style attack (my guess a dirty bomb), this should be enough to give him another 4 years, heck he may even cancell the bloody elections (I can confirm they have sought legal status if such a thing happens).  If this turns out to be the case, I see more wars on the way people and lots of them,  I believe the whole world will be shitting themselves at the thoughts of what the US response to any attack will be, remember the reasons used to justify the wars in Iraq and Afghanastan. All lies to further a foriegn policy goal which is to control the Oil come rain or shine.  As for the Uk I think it is most likly EU country to be targetted, being from Ireland this concerns me alot. I do not trust what the Blair gov has to say on anything, they are getting just as bad as the USA for the scaremongering, well they did not lick it of a spoon. Check their Pamphlet --http://www.preparingforemergencies.gov.uk/ .  I could go on and on but will not, my main point is that we are currently living in a cliamte of fear created by the gov  and centred on 1 main threat "Terrorism".  This has been the case since 911 and will continue to be the case for many a year to come.  I think this percieved threat is a tool of the gov to increase their powers over the citizens, implement policies which would not pass in cliamte of calm.   enough from me for now,  no doubt I will be back soon, I have copied the link below for you entertainment, I thought it was brilliant, have a look http://www.thomasscott.net/emergencies/index.htm,  Bye for now
