      This morning my husband has called 5 times on the cell phone needing me to check on things and look up phone numbers for him. I really don't mind. Makes me feel like he could not do it without me. We have our own contracting/remodeling business.   Today I am going to a friend's house that is a certified mechanic to have him check out my car. My GrandAm has the mysterious "low coolant" light on. It appears to have a slow leak somewhere, but two garages cannot find anything wrong with it. It is not overheating, just has the light on. My oil is clean and last February I had the intake manifold gasket replaced. Everyone says my headgasket is fine as well as all hoses, so I am at a loss. It just makes you feel uneasy in 95 degree weather to have that low coolant light on and having to get around.  After that I am going for lunch and then coming home to more housework. Not tons, just a little. Then I have actually bought a book this weekend to start reading again. I hope my attention span is still there! I never find myself sitting still for long, not even long enough for a full half hour sitcom. You would think that I would be thinner! I am hoping to find something that can hold my interest longer than a magazine article. I have established a new cozy nook reading area and it has been calling to me. The afternoon showers we have been having add to my desire to curl up and read.

      Now that could be alarming for any 35 yr old female. Luckily it just feels hairy because I am peeling from a sunburn. It is driving me crazy. No, it is not itching. I just cannot stand the thought of little dead patches of skin everywhere. Ick!   The sunburn is a result of a trip made to Ship Island last week. My step mother-in-law was down visiting. She had just lost both her mother and father within 5 weeks of each other and was feeling a little down, so my husband and I invited her for a visit. I get along great with her so I really enjoyed her company. Anyhow, one of the touristy things we did was ride a large ferry boat out to Ship Island and play on the beach for 6 hours. Now let me set this vision up for you: I have light skin and auburn hair, my mother-in-law has blonde hair and light skin. We both bravely (or is that stupidly?) thought we would wait for an hour or so before we put on our Waterbabies 50 spf sunblock. Idiots! Needless to say for the next 3 days we had to go braless. Not always a comfortable task for women who have had children and no cosmetic enhancements!   Ship Island is one of the barrier islands here along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. We do have regular beaches here, but the water is not clear like Florida because we have these barrier islands off the coast that inhibits the easy ebb and flow of the tide washing out the silt along the shoreline. If you travel a mile or so to any of the islands (Ship, Horn, Petit Bois, Chandelier, etc.) the water is a lot clearer. It is also a magical experience to have dolphins swimming by your boat or circling you swimming in the water only 20 feet away. Love it!  I think we have rain coming this afternoon. And tomorrow afternoon....and....I am about to get a shower and run to the library and local Walmart Supercenter. Also, a short stop at Bayview Gourmet for some muffins. I think I would like blueberry, blackberry, hmmm...I am definitely a berry lover. When my sister was visiting earlier this month she loved this little restaurant in the quaint town we grew up in, Ocean Springs, Mississippi. She also journals in a blog from her home in Chicago ( http://good2bhome.blogspot.com ). She has 4 children and many adventures. Heck, 4 children could be an adventure in themselves!  I must go now and scratch against the door jamb like a pig in a sty (peeling back again!) and then jump in the shower. Hopefully I can get my 3 yr old out of the tent she has built this morning and get her ready, too. Better strat now, it makes the transition less painful, for me that is. lol

      I mean that figuratively. I could never physically keep up with my mind which runs in circles. After 20 minutes I would pass out from the physical exertion. Yet my mind can go in circles for hours....  Today I am doing some last minute straightening before an old friend of mine, Sheila, comes to visit. We were good friends in high school. She is now a doctor and lives in Oakland, CA, with her husband, also a doctor, and their beautiful baby girl. Sheila is very sweet and generous. I question how much I have accomplished in life when I see all the work that they do. Don't get me wrong, I feel very useful and blessed to be a stay-at-home mom. I just tend to feel like I could offer more, more! Ah, well, a little laundry should fulfill me for today. lol  I am also feeling a little panicked. Let me explain something about myself, I tend to fret and worry over little things, things over which I have no control. This is a pattern in my life. I find my mind racing in circles trying to find a solution to that which I cannot doing anything about. Tiring? Yes, but unfortunately it is how I am wired.   On to my dilemma. Yesterday we received a 4 page letter from my husband's brother's girlfriend. (Soak that connection in for a minute) She is pregnant and about to deliver my brother-in-law's baby (August I think). Anyhow, my husband and I have never met her. About the most conversation we have had with her is when my husband has called the house and asked to speak to his brother. We decided to send a baby swing along with a box of new baby boy outfits/shoes to help them out and show our support. In return she sends this letter that goes on and on about things we have no knowledge about and in incredibly incoherent. In the letter she mentions moving down here. Now, I like my husband's brother and would like if he lived down here, but this girl we do not know at all and from what I understand has a questionable character. Anyhow, she is acting WAY too friendly, too fast. I would not mind getting to know her, but she has kind of stepped on my toes by writing this letter to my husband, to whom she has never said more than hi to. I guess you would have to read them to understand the high school mentality expressed in the letter. I hope everything works out between my brother-in-law and her, especially since they are about to have a baby, and I would like to try to get to know her, but she has very inappropriately sent my husband this letter and I am not happy with it. See, this is the type of thing I worry about. Useless, isn't it?  Anyhow, I just received a call from my husband. He is on his way home for a late lunch/early dinner due to the rain. Good snuggle weather I think...

      This morning I am sitting in my office listening to the mellow tunes of Diana Krall. I find her voice and music very soothing. I am sipping on my favorite cranberry tea and finding it very hard to become motivated. I slept in this morning and still need to shower and get dressed.  Today my daughter and I have a trip scheduled to the local library and a stop to pick up some of the most delicious muffins at a local gourmet restaurant. I also have a lot of house cleaning to do today. I have an old friend that I grew up with coming in town. I haven't seen her in 10 years. My husband and I will probably have them over for dinner.  The weather outside is a little overcast. Not necessarily bad news for someone living in the south. A little cloud cover helps cut down on the heat and humidity. Perhaps a good day for a bike ride?  Time to get dressed. My husband is on his way home and I want to present the illusion that I am more industrious than I am necessarily feeling today. What is marriage without a little mystery?? lol

      Today is a slow day. Slow as molasses due to the heat. It seems as if the sweltering heat and humidity has come on us sooner this year. My 3 year old and husband have both fallen asleep and I am typing on the computer. We live on the bayou along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hopefully as the day begins to wind down and the afternoon wanes, we will take a boat ride.   This past month my sister and her 4 children were visiting from Illinois (Chicago area). Now this week my mother-in-law will be visiting from Texas. I have been playing the hostess quite a bit lately! I enjoy the company and tourist-type activities. I must admit though, my obsessive side does sometimes interfere with the true hospitality spirit. I love having things in a certain clean and orderly fashion and have to mind my manners at times so as not to offend. I am just lucky my family loves me anyway.  Tonight or tomorrow during the day we have a small low pressure disturbance that may be coming towards the coast. By the time it gets here, it may be a tropical depression. All that means for us is wind and rain. Living along the coast we have seen many of these and they do not raise much cause for alarm. When we start to take notice is if it is a category 3 or higher hurricane headed this way. And this is supposed to be a much more active season they predict....  Time to wake everyone up from their nap so that we can get to bed at a reasonable hour tonight.

      It is a lovely afternoon, overcast with light drizzle here and there. Just what I need to calm my nerves. Gives me a homey feeling.  Today has been a busy day. This morning my daughter and I had to register for preschool. I have decided that we will try 2 days a week from 8:30 am-11:30 am. I think that is all momma can take right now! lol Baby steps for this momma. Anyhow, on the way to registration we had to pick up a form 121 with her shot records on it from the doctor's office. Surprise!! She needed a shot for chicken pox to complete the form. Just what every 3 yr old wants to hear at 8:30 am. After that we went and completed some applications and looked around her new school. She will be attending preschool at the local Methodist church. I am hoping this will provide her with some socialization she is craving at this age as well as some constructive activities.  During our registration process I received a distressing call. My husband called to tell me that a roofer we used for our construction business must have stolen his coil roofing nailer since he was the last to use it on a jobsite. I was livid! This roofer we ave given numerous chances because of his lot in life. But let me tell you, there are 2 things I DESPISE: a liar and a thief. We had to go spend another $300.00 for a new rofing nailer. It is not that we don't have the money, but it is the principle. The roofer would not answer his door when we went by his house. Or I should say when my husband went by his house. I went by on my own later and would not take no for an answer. When I could not get an answer at the front door, I went around to the back door and started knocking. I was so angry that the 2 pit bulls tied up in the yard barking at me almost escaped my attention. The roofer's nephew came to the door and had the gall to tell me that the guy did not live there anymore. I asked him to give him this letter and he refused. I left it with him anyway and simply stated he could choose to put his uncle in touch with me or he could explain it to the sheriff. He was trying to give me a bunch of attitude, but I made a few choice statements to get my point across and left. The track him and his uncle are headed down does not need any help to spiral further south. To make myself feel better, I took my daughter and I to have our nails done.  My daughter chose blue for her nails like any 3 yr old would. The salon does her nails for free and I just tip them really well. I chose a rose color. It is a lot easier to relax and unwind when someone is massaging your feet and calves. My husband indicated that he was a little jealous. I asked him have you looked at my feet? These are a working woman's feet. No appeal here! He is funny.  After the nails we went to lunch. We ate Chinese. When we were leaving I found a $20 bill in the parking lot by my car. I looked around and saw noone to claim it, so I put it in my purse. I figure that is a sign from above for me to give back to someone who needs it. We usually try to do that anyway. As our business builds, I find real joy in contributing more to church, charities, and people that we know that need the money. Recently we purchased an air conditioner for someone who had none here in the deep south in the middle of the summer. It feels realy good when you can help someone out, no matter how you do it. If I ever won the lottery I would probably set up a charity for different people and keep the charity anonymous in its donations to individuals. I am actually an old softy. I hate to admit it sometimes, but I am. I am the type that will pull over and wrestle a bird out of a cat's mouth (done that). Move a turtle out of the middle of the road. One of my favorite things to do is, when I am at a drive through window and there is someone behind me, I have been know to ask the cashier what their total is and pay for the meal as a surprise. I have done that a couple of times. Usually it is under $5 and what a lift to someone's day!  I think I need some tea. I want to sit down and read my magazine for a few minutes before my daughter wakes from her catnap. Have a good weekend to all!

      My sinuses are bothering me this morning. Living in the South is a constant test of wills. So many different allergy seasons, so little time to recover. And, the dust! I have never seen this much dust anywhere else. I hate to dust because of sinuses, plus within an hour or two, there it is again. That is not enough time for me to enjoy the fruits of my labor!   Speaking of my sniffer, I have to organize my closet today. Lately (the past 6 months or so) I have been in to anything that smells, in a pleasing way of course. I have managed to collect a variety of candles, both in scent and brand. Votivo, Trapp, Old Colonial, Yankee, and Root candles, to name a few. The one type of candle I am not fond of is anything food scented. However, Trapp candles makes a scent called White Nectar that makes me hungry when I smell it, yet I love the scent. I have also found an item that tends to scent the whole house, a catalytic lamp. I bought 2 Redolere lamps at a Hallmark store on Sunday. They burn oil with no flame, hence the catalytic part. The scent really does disperse and it eliminates odors such as smoke. My husband has just recently taken up the smoking habit after a 2 year hiatus and when he comes in from outside, this helps to rid the cloud that follows him inside.  Today my daughter and I may go swimming. I think we will go eat lunch at a little cafe and then swim at my parent's pool for an hour or two. Last night while she was getting a bath she said to me,"Mommy, I have no friends." I was unsure that she said friends, so I asked,"What do friends do?" She replied,"They play with me." It broke my heart. She is 3 1/2 and an only child (I have been unable to have any children since, even with Progesterone.) My daughter saw me start to tear up when she said that to me and said,"Mommy, don't cry. You are my best friend." Makes me cry now thinking of it. We do have some different friends that we have over or go to visit for her to play. I guess I just need to do a little more. She still has 2 years before she starts kindergarten because of where her birthday falls. This fall I am enrolling her in beginner dance and tumbling. I hope that she enjoys the activity as well as the companionship.  Sniffle, sniffle. Sinuses bothering and tearing up, just doesn't go well together. I have a little house cleaning to do today, but doesn't every day have a little? And I have one or two calls to make, but overall today is not too busy. A day for lazing in the pool. Swimming is best after about 2 pm. The past few days the heat index has been 105+ and the temperatures themselves have been 95+. You don't feel like doing much when you sweat everytime you breathe.   I think on my way out I will rent a movie for tonight. I wonder what comes out today? I know Starsky and Hutch (which I never watched growing up) is out now. I may have to compare that with what else is available. Sometimes I like a goofy movie that does not require too much of my attention to follow. I also have an odd sense of humor. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are right up my alley.  This little tidbit is just for my sister, who I know will eventually read this post. Today I will definitely get Blackberry, and maybe, ummmm, cranberry? I have to get four muffins so they put them in that little box. It is what makes me feel like I went to a bakery :p
