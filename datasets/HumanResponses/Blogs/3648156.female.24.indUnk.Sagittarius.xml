      Me and Baby went to the mall today.  Actually it's a "lifestyle center  urlLink  " not a mall.  What's the difference you ask?  Well a lifestyle center doesn't have a roof.  Imagine a circular strip mall.  I'm not mall people.  We made this unlikely journey is because it's about a million degrees and humid today and me and Baby were getting cranky at home in the heat.  We went to play at the tot lot, which is air conditioned.  Oh, how I love air conditioning.   When we're out at places like this I make it my business to observe people.  The demographic is white women, in their mid-thirties to early forties.  Well-dressed, expensive jewelry, nice bags, well-coiffed.  They have kids ranging from a couple of weeks old to five or six.  And they don't freakin' watch their kids EVER.  They do is sit in a group, sipping lattes, talking about their SUVs, house additions, sleevless sweaters, private schools, and vacations.   While the moms are chatting away a brother and sister pair, who were about 4 and 2 respectively, started poking and pushing My Little Girl, who isn't a year yet.  I spoke to them several times, explaining that Baby is smaller than them, and they shouldn't push her.  Then I started scanning the lot for their mother.  No one seemed to be looking for her children, and no one was watching them.  For a second I thought about holding them in the air and announcing "Watch out for these two, they're pushers".  I decided against that course of action.  Instead I said "Honey, please stop pushing her," and a rather elevated speaking voice.  At which point the wonderfully oblivious mother came over and took them away without a word of apology.  At least they weren't poking Baby in the eye anymore.    On the way home I reviewed the scene in my head.  I saw a mental slideshow of the day's mothers.  Comparing myself to them, not in a critical fashion, but trying to figure my place in this peer group.  And what I came up with is that I'm not like other mothers, but that's good.  I don't want the SUV, the house in the burbs, and as much as I complain about it, I really do like my job.

      My shoes are wet, my pants are wet, my hair is wet, and I'm cold.  Forget that it's about 80 degrees outside.  This is the third or forth day of afternoon thunderstorms (as the weather man would say).  Torrential downpour is more like it.  So I'm wet and cold and at work.  Three things that I just don't like, rolled up into one.

      This day started too early, as most do, and will end too late.  This is not a complaint, rather an observation.  My daughter, we'll call her A, is eleven months old today, this also marks eleven months of waking up to a human alarm clock.  I must admit that she is the best sleeper I've ever had the pleasure to meet. A sleeps for eleven or twelve hours each night.  Unfortunately, it starts at 6:00 pm. So we're awake with the sun every morning.  Make that every morning but Saturday, which is the one day a week that my husband, we'll call him R, gets up with her.  On this one beautiful day each week I get to lay in bed and sleep until 8:00 or 9:00.  A year ago, 9:00 was painfully early.    Now don't start thinking horrible things about R.  You see he works in the mornings and I work in the evenings (so we don't ever have to send A to day care (read baby jail)).  So while R doesn't get up with the baby, five days a week, he is up soon after, and walking out the door to work.  I'm on baby-duty until noon when he gets back home and we switch.  Sometimes we have time for lunch.  Then I'm at work until 9:00 pm.  When I get home A is in bed, sound asleep.    Sound asleep, that is unless I wake her by going into her room to turn off the air conditioner as I did last night.  This is how it went down:   10:30 - decide to take a shower, but make sure it isn't too cold in baby's room first 10:31 - open door, baby wakes up, starts crying, retreat to hall without being seen 10:35 - after listening to baby cry for an unbearably long time realize that she is not going back to sleep without eating, go into nursery, start feeding baby 11:25 - put baby back to bed, with full belly, remind self to never, ever, neverev go into baby's room while baby is asleep 11:30 - finally get in shower, have first alone-time all day midnight - watch tape of season premier of Six Feet Under, in bed with husband, fall asleep immediately afterwards  So today I am tired.  It's a little before 9:00 and I'm about to leave work.  It is pouring down BUCKETS of rain and I have to stop at the grocery store.  I get paid tomorrow so I can write a check tonight.  We've been eating peanut-butter for too long.  I will be tired again tomorrow.

       My husband made a thousand dollars this week doing nothing. That's right, his unemployment benefits finally came through. His first check was $750, three weeks worth of no job, and then later that week he got another $250. We're swimming in it now. Seriously.  The day that his first check day he handed me a sweaty $50 bill and said, go buy yourself something nice. I thought about this for a while, it didn't seem to make sense to me. I go to work 40-hours a week, 8-hours Monday through Friday, he stays at home, plays with our daughter, goes to visit friends, plays at the park, goes to the museums and HE gives ME money to buy myself something. Well, I took the money and ordered  urlLink shoes  yesterday. Zappos.com is the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean they always have my size (an 11) and free shipping. Why ever leave your house?  Well, they'll be her no later than Tuesday, August 2nd, and I promise to post pictures of them on my very own feet when they get here. Maybe I'll even photoshop in something fun, like a skateboard. Well assuming that I actually learn something about photoshop in the class I'm in right now.

       Ack, so much has happened since I've had time to post.&nbsp; I've been so obnoxiously busy.&nbsp; Work has been a steady stream of advertising positions, reviewing applications, interviewing applicants, and training new people.&nbsp; I've barely had time to take a shit, much less write anything.&nbsp; So, I fine myself today, sitting in my office with no interviews for the rest of the day, and no trainings scheduled until 5:00.&nbsp; I have time to type out a few lines.&nbsp;    Walking   Less than a week after Anika's first birthday, she started walking.&nbsp; Just a few godzilla like steps at first, but now she's really hauling ass across the living room without thinking.&nbsp; She still looks kind of drunk, she doesn't move with a real precise action, but she's getting places.&nbsp; The falls don't seem to bother her as much as they did a week ago, and she's perfecting getting up on her own.&nbsp; She first moves into a position that greatly resembles downward dog, then she bends her knees and slowly stands.&nbsp; She actually makes it all the way up about 75% of the time now.&nbsp; This is real progress.    Weaning   I'm making a half-assed attempt at weaning Ani.&nbsp; She's a year old, she doesn't  need  breast-milk or formula, and I'm starting to feel like a cow (See   urlLink  Concerning Boobs   ).&nbsp; However, after one day of this I already feel like a horrible person.&nbsp; I'm second guessing myself every time she pulls on my shirt.&nbsp; I'm starting to think that Anika has a  need  to nurse even if she doesn't have a  need  for breast milk.&nbsp; I'm already thinking of giving up.&nbsp; She won't drink the cow's milk (the really good, very expensive, local, organic milk) out of a cup, and I've been warned my several people that if I give her the milk in a bottle, she'll take that bottle with her to Kindergarten.&nbsp; (Although right now we're thinking about home schooling, so I don't really see how that is a problem).    Whining   Well, maybe I've just chosen a bad time to start weaning.&nbsp; There has been a considerable amount of fussiness emanating from the pants area of Anika for the past week or so.&nbsp; She's cut two teeth this week and I think there are about four or six others all trying to come in at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't imagine how painful that must be.&nbsp; We've exhausted our supply of Oral-gel and must purchase more before something horrible happens.&nbsp; Anika has been drooling non-stop and has developed this charming way of blowing spit bubbles to calm herself.&nbsp; This produces an awful lot of drool which runs down her chin and soaks her shirts.&nbsp; The first time I noticed her doing this we were in the car, I looked in the rear-view and she was literally foaming at the mouth.&nbsp; I pulled over and frantically searched for the this-is-for-emergencies-only-prepaid-cell-phone thinking she'd contracted rabies, before I realized that it was a cute spit-bubble game.&nbsp; Kids.&nbsp; I hope that this crop of teeth comes in soon, maybe then she'll accept weaning easier.&nbsp;

       Today my daughter turned one.&nbsp; It doesn't seem possible that she's only been in our lives for such a short period of time.&nbsp; I can barely remember what life was like before she was born.&nbsp; She has taught me so many things about myself, about the world, and about herself.&nbsp; Everyday I watch her as she grows, learns, and becomes more independent.&nbsp; The best parts of my days, and indeed my life, are the times spent with Anika and her dad.&nbsp; When we are all together as a family I know what truly matters.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      After a few weeks of feeling pretty miserable, mostly because of the brokeness, I finally get some good news..........I got a raise!  A whopping 7%.  In case you couldn't tell, that's sarcasm.  Now I make about 29K and change.  And it only took a YEAR to go through.  I was denied my piddling 7% for the last three quarters, but I guess the provost, who must make eight or nine times what I do, finally decided to cut me a break.   So, at least for today, I really like my job.  Work today went like this: 1. arrive 30 minutes late (no one noticed) 2. announce to subordinate that I’m leaving the office to go hang up flyers 3. spend about an hour hanging flyers 4. go to coffee shop on way back to car, get iced coffee and a scone, sit and enjoy while reading paper 5. stop at thrift store on the way back to the office, buy awesome retro green lamp, think about finding pink lamp shade, wonder if that would just be “too much” 6. get back to office, announce that I’m taking my lunch  7. after lunch review some applications, write some e-  mails, make some requests, file nails 8. meet briefly with boss, learn that raise was approved by provost, try not to appear overly enthusiastic 9. start writing blog entry  Tomorrow me and my new found wealth (and my husband too) are going out to lunch and then to see Fahrenheit 9/11 while his parents baby-sit! Yay for the weekend.

      While it may not be a very motherly thing to think, I'm just damn tired of whipping my boobs out anytime Ani is hungry or bored or needs comforting.  When I started breast feeding I thought I'd keep it up for about 6 months, then wean.  Well six months came and went.  Ani will be one in a week and she's still going strong.  In fact she want to nurse more now than she did a few months ago.  At her 9-month check up I discussed weaning with her doctor.  It looked like we were well on our way to a baby-led weaning process.  She wasn't too interested in nursing any more, she wanted to eat solids, things she could pick up herself, and only demanded the boobs in when she woke up and before bed.  This was progress I thought, and eventhough I was saddened by the thought of not feeding her, I also felt relief.  All this changed on our family vacation in May.  Suddenly I was around all day, which meant that my boobs were too, and Ani could eat whenever she wanted.  I was reluctant, but our first day of vacation was dominated my Ani crying, demanding milk, and me holding out.  On the second day I just couldn't take it and gave in.  Since then she has had a new found fascination with breast feeding.  She wants to nurse 5, 6, 7 times a day.  She has learned that the boobs are never far, just hiding under a shirt and bra for most of the day.  Now she pulls my shirt up and yanks on my bra.  When we play at home I have to sit with my boob out and she comes and goes as she plays.  Suck, suck, suck, play, play, play, suck, suck, suck, play, play, etc.  Maybe I should just keep breast feeding her until she gives up.  I keep thinking that it will happen soon.  We're going to introduce cow's milk soon and see how she deals with that.  I hope that she'll like it enough that we can wean without a crisis. I just want my boobs to stay inside my shirt for a whole day.  That would rock.

      My husband was fired from his part-time job last Monday.  A position in medical records that he'd held for over two years.  He used to work there full-time, then when our daughter was six months old, he moved to part-time so we wouldn't have to send her to day care.  Although it meant a 50% reduction in salary, we would have actually grossed less if we'd had to pay for day care.  Money was already tight, then he lost his job.  Why?  Because someone else in the office complained that his clothes were wrinkled (which they weren't) and that he smelled bad (which he didn't).  I don't know how this is grounds for termination, but they fired him.  With no warning.   My salary alone is not nearly enough to keep the mortgage paid and the electricity on and the pantry stocked for more than a few months.  I don't know where we can cut back, since we were already pinching every penny until our fingers bled.    I thought we might apply for food stamps.  I filled out the paperwork, but haven't been able to make myself go down to the social services building.  That would be admitting defeat.    I wish I could be mad at him, but I'm not.  I know it wasn't his fault.  I'm somehow mad at myself, although this makes no sense.  This situation is putting a huge strain on our relationship.  He's going to get depressed if he doesn't find a job soon, and that will make finding a job harder.  I just don't know what to do right now.

       Ever since I found out that I was pregnant with Anika, I worried that I wouldn't have any friends with kids. Which, for the most part has turned out to be true. Rob and I were one the first of our friends to get married and the first to have kids. We only had one other set of married friends, Anika's god-parents (do you still say "god-parents" if you're atheist?) and they moved to Indiana before Anika was born. It seems like now is the time all of our friends are getting married and engaged. We were just at a wedding a few weeks ago, and we have four, or is it five sets of couple friends who are engaged and planning their weddings. But still no other friends with kids.       So I decided recently to register with   urlLink  myspace   . It's not really something I'd normally do, not being a real big into using the internet to meet people. But I did it and I met some great people. One couple who will be having a baby in the fall, and another couple with a little girl about two. I was so happy to see that there were some other parents in my area who share similar interested and are about my age. I hope this doesn't sound too much like an advertisement for this silly web-site. I just wanted to reflect for a minute.
