      ok. 4th blog.  my weekend with will was spoil me. seriously. to the point where i feel guilt. i am not used to someone wanting to do all that stuff for me. it was a lovely weekend. nothing like laying around eating drinking and being in  one of my top three places to see.   the fact that i was there meant more than anything you know.  i have to remember to thank him for that.   i keep updating in this thing soley cause i like the template.  shows how lazy i am.  i sent andrew an email with the goings on of my life. of course he doesnt know it all but his response had the title "pensive". i didnt know how to take it. andrew's opinon weighs heavy on me.  andrew does not like matt.  andrew thinks will is using me.  both maybe true. one things for sure. i have to remind myself that i am going home and niether of these boys will be like..."no stay here" or "i'll come with you" i need to make this year a "boy vacation" year.   however...i already know its gonna be a "jennifers sad" year. overall. my heart will be broken.   when matt ditched out on me, i had a bad reaction. i would intentionally punish myself each time he ignored me, then i would repeat even though i knew he wouldnt.  on the other hand though, i knew that he would eventually deal with me. so i kept pushing.  god i want pizza. and those cute shoes i saw at target. or targee as they seem to like to call it.  curtis is in bed for being satan. cathy yelled at me for not spanking him.  jonathan ames willbe on tv tonight. he'll be a dork and i will love him for it.

      ok i wonder how long i will keep this "blog" for. Seriously  i am soo backwards when it comes to computers that it took  me like 10 minutes to see the tab to create a new blog.   i like this new empty space.   i get secretly excited each time privacy manager comes up on the telephone even though i know its  not who i want it to be. this is me apparently  back at 16 years old.   i think the next post is going to be all about matt. that makes me want to vomit all over myself. i am  not "that" person.

      i have no idea if i am doing this right??  meh oh well if not.  i will enjoy the hearty laugh ones will get when they are like..."stupid you've been doing it like this when you should be doing it like that"  meh.  packing my bags for a night with matt. most likely to clear things up. it took alot of talk to not really have it all solved. its not solved though.  2 outta 3 aint good you know. i'm gonna slow down. i cant like people for real while i am here. i am going home at some point...doesnt really make a differnce does it.  oh you boys. always screwing with my head.  i come home to go off with will. always fun. until the end...then i am not so fun.  when this is all over and i have 2 weeks to be alone again...ill lose my mind. reminds me of how lonely i get here

      day one of this blog. lets see what will come of it.  i slept with one sock on. i intentionally wanted to try to sleep with my sock on, just to see "if i could". the result was I took one off in the middle of the night because i was too hot. Seems it's fairly easy to sleep with one sock on. Its the two sock thing that will tear me down.   i havent bothered to put that other sock on. although they are cute, as far as socks go.
