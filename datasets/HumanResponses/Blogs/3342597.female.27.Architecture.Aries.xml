						   11 May 2004 - Tulisan Jelek   Kata Mas Yudhis, tulisan film ku jelek. Emang sih..hehehe... !! Habis nonton Homeland, aku nggak suka filmnya. Udah gitu selama nonton juga gak konsentrasi, abis ada Kelik..hihihi.. manusia malam itu. Trus Fahrenheit 911, aku nggak nonton, cuma disuruh nulis. Well, tapi sebenarnya, bukan soal itu.   Emang aku lagi nggak mood aja nulis...makanya tulisannya ngaco.  Kata mas Made, aku tuh harus duduk diem, konsentrasi. Barulah tulisanku bisa bagus. Mungkin juga. Aku kan beda ama Mas Krisnadi. Mas Krisnadi, banyakan malesnya tapi konsep tulisan udah ada di kepala. Sementara aku, udah males juga nggak punya konsep apa-apa dalam kepala...hihihi.   Kayaknya ini saat yang tepat untuk liburan. Ya sudahlah. NEXT TIME BETTER!!!   Eh, tapi ini ada hasil evaluasi Mas Yudhis, lumayan melegakan!!   EVALUASI GATRA EDISI 24 APRIL 2004 Boks:  Penjaga Gawang Mencari Jalan  (ASMAYANI KUSRINI).  Lead dibuka dengan: “Jangan diragukan, Amien Rais adalah news maker.” Kenapa dipilih kata “jangan” yang bersifat larangan langsung? Apa hak kita? Lebih netral: “Tak perlu”, atau langsung saja: “Amien Rais adalah...”   Apa pun Partainya, Minumnya Teh  (Pewawancara: ASMAYANI KUSRINI & HATIM ILWAN). Judul oke, tapi terlalu langsung, “terlalu sesuai” dengan slogan iklan/ kutipan Amien Rais. Sebaiknya, selalu dilakukan pendekatan “kontradiksi”/plesetan terhadap jenis-jenis ungkapan yang sudah “baku” (judul buku/film, peribahasa dll), sehingga kita tampil lebih cerdas. Misalnya: Apa pun Partainya, Minumnya tak Pernah Nyampe. Tapi, isi wawancara oke. AR memang politisi jenis yang quotable. (Apa pun pertanyaannya, jawabannya pasti laik kutip!)   ARSITEKTUR (100-102):   Gedung Telanjang Warisan Kahn  (ASMAYANI KUSRINI). Judul dan cerita bagus! Lead of the Week!!   EVALUASI GATRA EDISI 1 MEI 2004  Dokumen Hantu Mata Sipit  (ASMAYANI KUSRINI). Judul oke. Pemikat kepanjangan, potong satu kalimat. Cerita, oke. Ilustrasi kronologi bagus.   PRAYOJANA (h-47-53)   Konsistensi Karakter dalam Kotak  (ASMAYANI KUSRINI). Cerita dan foto-foto bagus. Akan lebih bagus jika sebagian foto dibuang (kebanyakan bikin sumpek), agar gambar bisa besar-besar. Sayang tak ada foto sang tokoh, arsitek Tan Tjiang Ay.   ARSITEKTUR (h-90-91)   Mimpi Spektakuler Pancasila  (ASMAYANI KUSRINI). Judul juga spektakuler, tapi oke. Cerita agak ruwet dengan proses pemilihan.    FILM (h-99)  Bertahan Hidup di Rumah Kabut  (ASMAYANI KUSRINI). Judul, pemikat dan tulisan bagus! Memberi pengayaan dengan aspek (penulis) novelnya.   EVALUASI GATRA EDISI 8 MEI 2004   Pelintiran Temu Empat Mata  (ASMAYANI KUSRINI). Judul & cerita oke. Kalimat penutup (“Jangan-jangan, inilah cara Gus Dur membesarkan Hasyim Muzadi”), merupakan simpulan yang “mengejutkan”. Ketajaman analisisnya, oke. Tetapi, kalau melihat perkembangan hingga sejauh ini, kesimpulan tersebut bisa disimpulkan “terlalu jauh”!

						    Mon, 30 Jun 2003 11:15:16   Rini-DONG,  What an email! It was longer than all the other emails I had today combined! But that's good, because I love to read, and I love to read messages from far away ... it is almost a substitute for travelling, to receive a message from a distant place and to imagine the place it came from. It reminds me that the world is bigger than the walls of PAI, bigger than the city limits of London, bigger than the coasts of the UK ...  It sounds like terrible times at the airport! I really hate that, that certain moment when you realise that the adventure has come to an end and you have to return to the boring reality of your everyday life. It is no surprise that many people choose to travel all the time, never returning home but always moving somewhere new.   I'm pleased that the homeless guy called you - it showed you that you had a really positive influence on a new person while here in London. Make that two people, because you had a really positive influence on me as well. I don't know what to think about Friday and Saturday, and I am trying not to think too much about it and to destroy the memory by attempting to give it too much definition or analysis. I have to be artistic and not scientific in this instance! Like you say, what will be, will be, and what has been, has been. I have no regrets, as long as you have no regrets either. It is good to travel through life collecting experiences, and to establish connections with people, of whatever type. I once remember Thom Yorke from Radiohead saying something similar in an interview: that "the purpose of life is to meet and make connections with people. Because there's nothing else to do". I think it's a good philosophy; or at least it's a better philosophy than any I could invent!   I don't know if I have found a friend, or something more, or something else, or whatever, but all I know is that I have found a Rini, and the word Rini has more symbolism than any other descriptive term. So, grunge girl, I just got your sms about new year - it seems that you will be very busy then as well. I guess I will plan my trip to Indonesia for next year, and for now I will have to content myself with daydreaming. I am very good at daydreaming, so hopefully I will be contented enough.  Have fun in Makassar with your family ... and it seems as though they confused you with Tanto in suspecting that Club X was a strip-club! That terrible London, destroying the innocence of so many young Indonesians! I hope you enjoyed the band, and it was great to hear the first diary entry of Rini. I look forward to the next entry. Until then: keep smiling, and laughing, and singing, and saying 'MY GODD'!   I miss you a lot. Who else do I have to visit the underground vaults with?????  Matt-lah.   Tue, 1 Jul 2003 10:26:43   Asmayani Kusrini, DONG! How are you? I've been getting your sms messages all day, and trying hard to reply but still, STILL, my damned phone network is not sending them. To make things worse, the stupid PAI office still has no internet access so I have been searching for an internet cafe ... sometimes it seems as though the entire concentration of the world is spent upon ruining my attempts at communication: no phone, no internet, all the internet cafes are full up ... any second now a freak earthquake will cause this PC to fall to the ground and even this unfinished message will be lost. Let's hope not ....  Putra spoke to me about his girlfriend and yes, she has got chicken pox, and you are quite correct in saying that it is a 'pustular skin eruption' but, MY GOD, Rini, what a way to describe it! A pustular skin eruption - it leaves nothing to the imagination whatsoever! No wonder you are a journalist - maybe you should consider a career as a horror novelist! And for someone who doesn't even like cemeteries either ... my god ...  I am still disgusted that Poppy and Damai became obsessed with that guy (he's from Ukraine, by the way). And they are two old women, married, with children, who should know better! I am glad to hear that you did not share in their crush, otherwise I would think that the whole world is going crazy. You know, he and I don't really like each other very much ...   I received your sms with the words from 'Black' by Pearl Jam in it ... I tried to send you some song lyrics in reply, but my annoying phone again refused to send them. My first thought was to send you some words from Fake Plastic Trees by Radiohead ... "she wears me out .... she weeeearrrrrrrrs me out" (although of course I had to add that you wear me out in a good way). And then I thought that maybe, in answer to your lyrics (which seemed a little despairing) I could send "hey you, don't let me down, take a sad song ... and make it bettterrrrrrr" by of course the Beatles. I remember that night in the bar in Scotland with you, Poppy and Putra, with the three of you singing along as loud as you could to that song which was being covered by that young guy. It still makes me smile ;-)  Hey and guess what else? I no longer have to be jealous of your video tapes, because today I found the tape of all the interviews so I can watch them to remind myself of you and of everyone else! Maybe we could arrange a swap - I'll copy you that tape, if you copy me yours ...  Your secret cape sounds really nice, and it's terrible that civilization has invaded it. Everyone needs somewhere quiet and unspoiled, even if it is only inside their head. Maybe you can invent a mental cape that you can escape to, although it's never as satisfying as going to the real thing. A mental cape where you can meet Kurt Cobain, Ed Vedder and the rest of your heroes, and sit around strumming guitars with them, watching the sunset, talking about life and everything else, a place that GATRA doesn't have the number for so that they can never track you down, a place where you can catch fish that will already be hot and spiced so that you can eat them immediately after you've caught them.  And now you are taking a cookery course? My God, you are so active ... you work so much, you belong to so many organisations, and now you are taking classes as well. It makes me embarrassed that I am so lazy. But I am very enthusiastic and encouraging of your cooking course ... because when I come to visit you can cook me lots of wonderful things, lah? I don't mean to be sexist, because of course I wouldn't really expect you to cook for me (it's a good thing this email is not being sent to Damai) but already I am looking forward to the taste of Indonesian food. I might take my brother to Bali Bali one day, I think he'd like it. Incidentally, my brother has brought back all the CDs I requested, so I can make you a really good tape. Prepare to hear some amazing music, Rini, and I won't even be singing it myself!   Well, I think I have written almost as much as you have. My friends always say 'my GOD Matt, you write so much!' but I think in you I have met someone who beats me. Which is a good thing, because I don't feel so guilty about making someone read all my crazy thoughts and impressions.  Have a big hug from me, mi querida Rini, and I will write some more soon.  Remember to practise your Slovak language every day: ZMRZLINA!   Matthew.  PS - you know I now have 3 Indonesian-English dictionaries??? Nurcholis gave me 2, and Runi gave me 1, so I guess I have no excuse for not learning Indonesian, hey?   SALING BERCIUM!   Wed, 2 Jul 2003 10:25:54  My GODD ... I didn't know that 'bajingan' was such a bad word, I'm sorry ... I searched for 'devil' in the dictionary, and I found the idiomatic phrase 'little devil', which in English is a 'cute' phrase that means something like 'naughty'. I'm glad you didn't take offence, anyway, and I'll certainly make sure I don't say it to any strange Indonesians! I don't want them to break my nose, and even though (I think) I am very tall compared to many Indonesian people, they might know some kind of kung-fu or tae-kwon-do or Thai kickboxing that I would have no defence against! You know, it's always been an ambition of mine to learn karate, or kung-fu or something like that, just in case I was ever attacked by an angry Indonesian or any other angry people. London can be a dangerous place (Runi can confirm that), especially in some parts, such as the part I was born in. Can you believe that somebody I once knew at school is now in prison for committing armed robbery? And that som eone else from my school was killed in a knife fight outside a McDonald's restaurant? Maybe that's why I never had a 'gang' at school, because the gangs were always fighting each other, and fighting other gangs at other schools, and so on ... it's probably very tame compared to Indonesian schools.   Hey that's a coincidence, because I was going to send an email to Runi to say thank-you for leaving me the dictionary, and as a joke I was going to say that when her new baby is born, if it's a boy, she might like to name it Matthew. But now I can't make that joke, because she will be sure that I have been speaking to you or to someone else that knew about her stomach-touching aura activities! It's very complimentary, if Runi wanted her baby to be like me, although as a 23 year-old man it is a little disturbing that women see me as having all the desirable qualities for a baby, rather than having all the desirable qualities for a man. Still I should stop complaining: a compliment is a compliment, right? Better to be a baby than a dog, or a politician ...  As for getting angry, sure I get angry, just like everybody else, but maybe the difference is that I find the whole idea of anger a very funny one. Especially for someone like me, a 'decadent westerner' who has never really known any pain or hardship in their life, at least not pain in the sense of torture, revolution, oppression, starvation, earthquakes. Whenever I get angry, I get into a rage for a second or two, my face turns red like a tomato and my eyebrows lower, I growl like a devil, and then a second later I start laughing because I realise how funny it is that I am getting so annoyed because of whatever the issue is. It's the same when other people get angry: they start shouting, and growling, and their face turns red and their veins start to pop out from their necks, but instead of being scared or concerned I always begin to laugh. But then again, there is always something guaranteed to make me angry, and it's too difficult to laugh about ... MARGARET THATCHER. My GODDDD, that woman makes me really ANGRY! I don't even want to start thinking about her.  I hope you enjoyed your cream hair-bath (in English, that phrase sounds a little strange ... like something Tanto would have experienced when he went to Soho: my god, that guy still makes me laugh even now). It's a shame that people still describe you as the ex-girlfriend of the guy who took an overdose ... I suppose it's a very common thing, to describe someone as 'the friend of x' or 'the girlfriend of y' - we are always being defined in terms of someone else, and for you it's just unfortunate that you are associated with such a sad situation. My advice is to do something amazing, become a celebrity, make a grunge album, fly to Mars, so that the legend of Rini becomes more famous than the story of your ex-boyfriend. I will start spreading your legend here in London by telling everyone I know about your adventures ... catching SARS in Singapore, going to Aceh, meeting PADI, writing 30,000 words in four hours, having a house full of servants ... ;-)  Talking of words, if you need any help with your article on Marx, just ask me. I know a little bit ... I studied Marx for a while at university, and I wrote an essay on his influence in British literature. I could probably also suggest a few articles for you to read, and find a few books that might have a whole chapter on Marx and England that you can copy-lah!  Okay I'd better go - tonight I am going out with my brother, I don't know where yet, maybe just get some food, and have some drinks. Try and get some sleep tonight, so you don't wake up surrounded by lots of screaming girls! For a man that would be like waking up in paradise, but for you I'm sure it's like waking up from a dream into a nightmare!   Take care little devil - not a demon, like Frans Padak!   Sayanara  Matthew Bloomsbury   Thu, 3 Jul 2003   Christ on a bike. So Runi called me a 'chubby baby'? Damn, that's another insult to add to my list. Chubby is a very cruel word in English ... it means (as I'm sure you know) to have a fat face. Well I was just about to buy myself a meat sandwich for dinner (because I haven't eaten anything yet today) but I guess I will go hungry, to try and escape the chubbiness :-(  I have just attempted to go shopping - GOD, I hate shopping. I bought a shirt, coincidentally I was trying on a black one but it didn't fit properly. I'm glad you like the black shirt though; it's my favourite as well. I will wear it every day in Italy - or perhaps I will buy five more and wear a different one each day!   But all these complaints are insignificant compared to what you are telling me about Aceh and the missing journalists. My God, I hope you are not sent to Aceh, because I would be worried - and if you were kidnapped, then I would be forced to try and rescue you, and of course I would be unsuccessful and get kidnapped as well and we would both be locked in a cell, given only bread and rats to eat. And one of your friends died in your arms as well ... Rini, you are so young, but you've had all these deaths to deal with already - it makes me realise how lucky I am to live in the UK.  When do you return to Jakarta? Is it this weekend? Back to your little room, and your desk, and the smoke and the traffic? Do you plan to meet with any other participants, or will there not be enough time? I hope your boss gives you something interesting to write about ... maybe he will ask you to write about your experiences in London, the Parliament, the BBC etc. Unless he wants to restrict your London stories to just Harry Potter!  I have to go now and continue searching for hotels in Italy. I am so lazy - I simply want to go home, eat, sleep and never think again about work, holidays, the world, anything. Maybe I should learn to meditate, to clear my mind of everything so that no thoughts can disturb me or annoy me. Matthew Bloomsbury Buddha!  Okay take care grunge girl  Matthew.   Fri, 4 Jul 2003   Purple light! My GOD, it's already been a week (almost) since you left the UK! It currently feels as though I am simply taking a break from all the Indonesians, and that next week you will all be back again, just as normal, going on visits in coaches, and I'll be running up and down from the office to the hotel all the time. But no ... you are in Makassar, and will be in Jakarta tomorrow, and next week I will be in Rimini - international friends-lah! Rini-Dong! Rini, rini. My GODDDD ...  My phone has just quit on me: there's no power left in the battery. It's not surprising as I have been calling Italian hotels all afternoon. When I get home I'll recharge it, and send you loads of sms messages. Tonight is a lazy night ... I am watching a movie with my brother, and eating junk food - sometimes it's the nicest thing, to just sit around and watch a crappy Hollywood movie. It's a waste of time, sure, but often it is a privilege to have enough time to waste. If I come to Jakarta, I will make sure that we spend at least one day just loafing around: watching movies, drinking coffee, eating ice-cream (zmrzlina) and falling asleep. My GOD, I can't wait, I'm gonna book my ticket already!  Tomorrow is shopping day: my brother and I will go together to central London. He will be able to tell me what looks good and what doesn't: for some reason, I find it really hard to buy clothes (lack of decision again!). Plus he has a grunge style too so he can point me in the right direction. Terima kasih for your nice words about my t-shirt and jeans style. I feel infinitely more comfortable in casual clothes than in a suit. You know, I always thought hmmm, Rini looks very good in her baggy trousers: but then one day you wore a pair of tighter black/grey trousers, and you know what? (I shouldn't tell you this) I couldn't stop myself from staring at your ass, because it looked so good in those trousers. Of course later I discovered that it looked good without ANY trousers ... ;-P  I hope you are prepared, and that you are not over-weight with your baggage at the airport - it would be a shame to waste the £158 on baggage penalties! Have a good flight-lah!   Goodnight purple Rini-Dong  Matthew Bloomsbury-Dong   Mon, 7 Jul 2003  Hmmm ... so your friend is disappearing from the 'front lines', and retiring to live a quiet life in the Netherlands? Maybe you should go to the wedding: I would love to see the pictures of you in a pink bridesmaid's dress!!!!! ;-P It sounds as though a lot has changed since you have been away: new housemates, changes at work ... a month is a long time in political journalism. Are you glad to see your little room again? I hope you have filled it up with all the things you brought from the UK! And I hope your family didn't eat all the sweets you brought back ... last year's participants fell in love with Cadbury's chocolate, and took back many kilograms of bars with them - the chocolate was one of the main reasons their baggage was so overweight!   Thanks for the phonecalls and the sms messages over the weekend. It was nice to know that ten thousand miles away somebody was wishing me a happy birthday! And I can't believe I spent the whole weekend SHOPPING! I hate shopping, I hate it passionately ... but then I would have been so embarrassed wandering around Italy in my ragged old clothes - my few good clothes would have got dirty very quickly, and I might have even had to wear my suit, my GODD!  As usual I obeyed my prejudices and avoided the shops near where I live, and went to Covent Garden. I didn't find much there, so the next day my brother and I decided to go to Camden - we thought that we might as well visit some local shops first, and to my surprise there was a new shop, full of sk8er clothes ... I am not really a sk8er boi, but I found some nice clothes there and we didn't have to go to Camden at all. But we both really like Camden so we'll go there later on in the summer for a drink. I will remember the good time that you and I had there, and I will say hello to the canal and to the bars for you ;-)  Well little flower, I hope the storm of your first day back didn't damage your roots! It sounds as though you jumped straight back into things: and was offered a position with Reuters as well! Congratulations. Although I can understand if you don't accept it: a few weeks ago, I was offered a job with a charity as a Policy Advisor. I turned it down: not because I didn't like the job, but because I didn't want to commit myself to staying in London for the next few years. Sometimes it's good to take chances, but it's also good if you don't compromise your freedom-lah!   Rini, rini. Two mobile phones, three numbers, two cards - what a crazy life! I am surprised that you have a head of such thick and healthy black hair - you should be bald and grey with the amount of stress that you have. Maybe you have discovered the secret of relaxation: a cool drink, Pearl Jam and a puff of marijuana! Welcome back to Jakarta, anyway: take care of yourself, be good, and let the little devil loose from time to time!  Sayanara  Matthew.   Fri, 11 Jul 2003 09:52:45   My GOD! I spend three days in Italy and you decide to marry a gay guy! The world moves so quickly. But my initial thought is that it doesn't sound like a bad idea, if you are really so desperate to leave Indonesia straight away. Are you really so desperate to leave? Marrying someone for a visa\passport sounds very extreme, but then many people say that 'extreme times call for extreme measures'. A gay guy would be the ideal candidate to marry, of course, because it would avoid any potential problems involving love and sex.   I'm really sorry you can't call me (and I can't call you) from here ... I thought that my phone network had an agreement with an Italian company, but I was mistaken-lah! Anyway, I am having a good time so far: the first city we stayed in was quite small and quiet, but today we arrived in Rimini which is a party city, so it should be exciting! The weather is very very hot, and I am melting like an icecream (or a 'gelata' as they are called here). And of course I am becoming even more of an ORANGE BOY!  You know, as I am your diary, you can be my invisible friend while I am in Italy, because on many occasions I have thought while here that it would be good to have you here with me, to walk around with, to see the sights with, to experience this country with. So please don't be alarmed if I have imaginary conversations with you over the next week!  Okay my time in this cyber-cafe is almost finished, so I had better say arriverderci, ciao, and va bene! Molti abrazzi!  Blooby Matthew Bloomsbury   Tue, 22 Jul 2003 03:27:45   Rini-lah,  Yes I tried to call you from the airport in Italy, to tell you that I had missed my flight and so I wouldn't be able to call you from the UK like I promised, but for some reason the connection didn't work so I couldn't speak to you. Italian public phones - arrrggghh it took me ages to try and understand how to use them!  My GODD, I still really want to be back in Italy! I had such a great time, it really makes me realise how bad my life is here in London, working for PAI. Ohhhhh, to just sit down under a big parasol at a cafe in Bologna, smoke a cigarette, drink a glass of fruit juice and watch the world walk and cycle by!  It's great that I am able to talk to you and send you sms messages again. I was so disappointed when I discovered that my mobile wouldn't work in Italy. But hey, I got some great postcards of each place I visited: Forli, Rimini, San Marino, Bologna, Parma - you can make a display with them when I send them! And don't worry, I will remember to send them to your work address. Can you remind me of that address?  Hey, I also got an email from Runi. I wrote to her to say thanks for the Indonesian dictionary that she left for me, and she wrote back and challenged me to learn Indonesian! She also said "I know what you did on the final Friday night, which is why you were so tired and couldn't come to the airport" ... MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDD!  Arriverderci l'amica  Matthew, matthew   Wed, 23 Jul 2003 08:11:11   I still can't stop laughing at that name 'Blooby'. It doesn't have a meaning in English, but it has a certain sound that is funny, a bit like 'blobby' or 'gloopy', which are both slightly disgusting words in English. But even so, I suppose I am getting used to the nickname!  Such a shame that your energy and mood will be wasted on GATRA's assignments, rather than spent on poetry or music. Lucky for GATRA that they will get the maximum of your energy! But it's always the same ... if we spend lots of time at work, then work gets the benefit of our good moods and energies.   That's interesting: the Indonesian Government can't buy British planes. I didn't know that. Does Britain refuse to sell the planes to Megawati's government, or are the planes so bad that Russian planes are considered to be better? A few years ago there was a scandal about British warplanes falling apart at high speeds and killing their pilots.   And congratulations - you won the kite competition! Even if you don't have time to fly it, you can always hang it from the ceiling of your room-lah. It would make a great decoration.   Tomorrow I will take my camera to the developers, and print my pictures. I'll ask them to print two copies, so that I can send you any good pictures, although I warn you, nearly all of the pictures I take look really bad. I can never get it right: always the light is too weak, or too strong, or I am standing in the wrong position, or the picture simply looks boring. This time I tried to take some more interesting pictures, from unusual angles - at one stage I was lying on my back in a Catholic church, taking a photo of the paintings on the ceiling!   Okay Vietnam girl, I'll keep the record of your office address. Now get some sleep in your new redecorated room!  Ciao  Matthew Bloomsbury    Fri, 25 Jul 2003 08:03:49   Asmayyyyyyyyani KusRINIDONG! You have to make time for yourself, my GOTT. But I hope you managed to finish your assignments. Mr Burhan's daughter must always finish her assignments, or else she will never be able to say, on behalf of all of us, we are very diverse group ya, four of us from printed media, one from NGO ...  I am so glad it's the weekend. For the first two days I returned to the office, my nose and throat felt terrible, and my head felt as though somebody had been sitting on it for a week. The last two days, my head has felt okay, but my nose and throat haven't got the message and so I have had no motivation to work, just to sit around and stare into space ... my GOTT, such a lot of complaints about a stupid case of flu! I should realise how lucky I am!   Have you been able to see any of the others since you returned to Jakarta? I'm curious to know if anyone has been 'changed' by their experiences in London: if Tanto has decided to dress like the people in Soho, or if Pak Franz still continues to look at the naked Page 3 in the Sun paper.   And hey - I am definitely going for another holiday in August! My friend from Ecuador emailed to say that he's booked his ticket, although it wasn't clear if he is flying to Madrid or to Amsterdam (I think it might be Madrid via Amsterdam). I'm so pleased - it's always depressing when PAI just stretches ahead of me without any end! And what about you - are you going to Aceh? Or put back inside the Parliament to cover the annual conferences? Poor Rini-lah, no more adventures, unless you put on your backpack again and run off to the Phillippines, Laos, Thailand ... maybe you can go to Vietnam and, because you look Vietnamese, get a passport and become a citizen, start a whole new life!   Almost time to go hoooooomeee ... arrivederci my friend  Matthew Blooby Bloomsbury   Mon, 28 Jul 2003 02:25:55   My GOTT, the GATRA office is used as a film location? It must be a really nice office in that case - lucky Rini-DONG to be working there, and to sleep under her desk! I will look out for some Indonesian films in the UK, and if there's an office scene, I will look for you hiding like a mouse under your desk, killing the bugs that are crawling on it!   So it sounds as though everyone is keeping in touch, or most people anyway. If it's Putra's birthday tomorrow, I'd better send him an email. How old will he be? or doesn't he want people to know his age ... ?  The PAI office is quiet today: Don has gone on holiday, and at the end of the week nearly everyone else will be away too, so it will be just me and one or two others, which means I can mess around on the internet all day! I can't wait for that. Don has gone to Egypt, the lucky old bastard, for two weeks. He has so many holidays. Earlier in the year, he went to Barbados for two weeks - and because he went to Barbados, I had to cancel my plans to travel with a friend to Venezuela. I was very angry about that, because I had hoped to spend a couple of days in Ecuador as well to see my other friend. Never mind.   Yes, my flu still loves me. I cannot believe that one human skull can hold this amount of - well, I won't be disgusting, but you can imagine what I am talking about. There is no end to it, it keeps flowing and flowing. It's like nuclear fuel, a continually-renewable resource. Maybe I could find a way to burn it and generate electricity: I could be the eternal power source for the UK!   Oh well. Time to start researching the prices of my flight to Madrid! (OUCHHH it's not going to be cheap)  Ciao bella  Matthew Bloomsbury-DONG   Mon, 28 Jul 2003 09:32:11   Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr - my GOTT, Rini-DONG, I am so frustrated! I am trying to book a flight to Madrid, but I need to know when the friend I am meeting there is travelling back to London (because the whole point of the trip is to travel back to London with him). I have found a cheap flight - well, quite cheap: it's one hundred and twenty pounds, which is about eighty pounds cheaper than any other flight, and my GOTT, eighty pounds is a lot of money! Yes, even to a terrible Westerner like me, it's a lot of money! I remember when Tanto asked me if I got paid 4000 pounds per month - my GOTTTTTTTT, no way! I don't get ANYTHING LIKE that kind of money!  But I can't book the flight until I know when he is returning, so I keep returning to the website just to check if the special offer is still there, and I just looked now - and it's GONE! I can't believe it! I have sent my friend hundreds of emails, saying plllllleeeeease, let me know when you are flying to the UK, because I can't get my ticket otherwise! And still I have no answer.   It reminds me of when I was hoping to go to Cuba in May ... I was going with a friend who lives in Mexico, and we made plans, I found a flight on some suitable dates and sent her an email saying 'hey, how about these dates?' - and waited ... and waited ... and waited ... and waited ... for a reply ... each day I returned to the website, and each day the price of the flight had increased by five or ten pounds, and after two weeks I realised her lack of response had cost me almost one hundred pounds, so I simply told myself to forget about the holiday.   My GOTTTT - I hate having to depend on other people for my plans! It makes me feel like a child! I think I should follow the Rini-lah example - buy a backpack and just LEAVE!   Oh, listen to me, complaining about all this nonsense! But travelling is such an important thing to me - it's one of the few times that I feel I am really alive, and so I am always anxious for it not to be spoilt, or to give somebody else the control over my happiness!   Hey, today you have become my diary! Sorry Rini-DONG, it's supposed to be the other way round! Never mind. Tell me - did you manage to book a hotel for Bandung? Or will you have to wait for another time? I haven't heard much about Bandung - is it a tourist place, or a big city ... ?  Okay-den, have a nice night-lah!  Bloo.   Tue, 29 Jul 2003 07:58:22   Ahh - luckily, my bad moods do not last very long. I have now managed to buy some tickets, and I found some that were really cheap! I saved myself over one hundred pounds! I also booked hotel rooms for me and my friend. I will be arriving one day earlier than him, so I can meet him at the airport, take him to the hotel etc - because he, as we say in the UK, "does not know his ass from his elbow", so I feel that I have to look after him, just like Hermione Granger has to look after Harry Potter. Just like I have to look after Bob and Don and all of the Transition to Democracy group as well, my GOTTTT!  I can't believe that in these two days, I have not done a single piece of PAI work. I have been spending all my time looking for flights, and hotels, and sending emails ... but it's been fun, certainly a lot more fun than working.   My flu has almost left me - for the first time in ages I don't keep coughing every five minutes, and using thousands of tissues each day and sniffing all the time. I can start smoking cigarettes again!!!  My GOTT, a Tea Party at the Ambassador's House! Rini-lah, you really are becoming one of the social elite! Soon you will be telling me that you are going to be a politician, supported by your network of important and powerful business associates! And a meeting with Win Griffith as well, my GOTT. Just make sure you don't oppress me, okay?   So tell me about your travelling. I want to know all the places you have been, which were your favourites, which ones you didn't like, where you want to go to next ...  Almost time to go home, yessss, my GOTT-lah!  Bloo.   Wed, 30 Jul 2003 08:01:25   Rini-DONG-lah!   The orange Hulk, can you imagine? Raaaaaaahhh!   I'm glad you like the phrase 'doesn't know his ass from his elbow' - it's a typically English phrase, even more a specifically London phrase, and to be pronounced properly you should say 'arse' instead of 'ass'. It's one of my favourite phrases, especially as I seem to have so many friends who don't know their arses from their elbows!   It sounds as though you have a very exciting life as a journalist. But it also sounds as though you have a life that is very immediate, very hectic, and that you don't have time as a journalist to rest, to think, to take a long-term view - you are always in the middle of events and in the middle of the world, instead of being able to take a step back and to look at the world from the outside for a moment. It must be very exciting but also very frustrating.   For me I think it's the opposite. All the time I am standing outside of the world, outside of current events, observing them but not really feeling like a part of them. Maybe we should swap lives for a year! Maybe I should set up an internet exchange society, for people to swap lives with each other for a year ... sounds like a good idea?  I just started reading Che Guevara's Bolivian Diary. As always, whenever I read about Che it makes me desperate to visit Cuba. Sometimes I even get a pain in my stomach and an ache in my legs just thinking about going to Cuba, because I want to go so much. I almost went in May, but my friend cancelled at the last minute and for some reason I decided not to go by myself. I wanted to go last year, but instead chose to visit Ecuador and see another friend. I think I do too much planning and not enough action! What I will do is wait until October or November (when I can take some more time away from work) and go to Havana for a week. If anyone wants to come with me, that's great: if not, I'll just go by myself. I think I have to go to Cuba soon, otherwise I will never have any peace!  That's enough of my complaints. So you are getting excited about the Parliamentary Conference? That's good - it is good to get excited about politics, because politics is so important, although most of the time it is just frustrating when nothing ever changes. Will you be interviewing any of the politicians, maybe even Megawati? Or perhaps Burhan - "And tonight, a GATRA exclusive: Pak Burhan interviewed by his own daughter!"  I wonder if you will let the devil loose while you are covering the Conference? That could create some headlines ...  Ciao my friend!  Matthew Bloomsbury   Tue, 5 Aug 2003 04:12:38   Rini-Dong-lah-Dong!  (that can be your Vietnamese name. I think it's a good Vietnamese name)  So you went to a party, then to Bandung, City of Flowers, my gott, such an exciting life, even though it makes you tired!  As for Leicester, it is a city in the middle of the UK, maybe an hour from London by train. Like many cities in the middle (the region called 'Midlands') it has a very large Asian population, so it is quite a cosmopolitan city. I don't know much about the university, but I think it has quite a good reputation.   Higher education is just a term for 'education after high school'. So higher education is just a description of all types of university study. Postgraduate is a more specific term: it relates to courses that are taken after a bachelor's degree, for example a master's or a PhD. Students studying for a bachelor's degree are called 'undergraduates', and students studying for a master's degree or a PhD are called 'postgraduates' - it is simply a way of identifying the different levels of university study.  So to answer your questions: a postgraduate programme is a higher education programme. It is the same as saying "a car is a machine". A car IS a machine, but machine also has a wider definition. A car is a type of machine.   And similarly, a master's degree IS a postgraduate degree. It is a specific type or level of postgraduate degree.   And as for postgraduate research programme ... I don't think that is any specific kind of qualification. It is probably a wider term for a number of different master's degrees and Phd's.   And - my god, I just got your sms about the bomb. That's awful - shit, I'd better call u   Mon, 11 Aug 2003 06:36:28   Ohhhhhh, Rini !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Poor Rini. Rini, rini. Rini-Dong. Rini-dong-lah. Did you manage to get any sleep, at all, in your own room? I hope so, or else you might start to have hallucinations and hear strange voices in your head! But this week you are flying to Bangkok-lah, is that correct? I hope you will be able to get some sleep while you are there.  Maybe sometimes you need to say something if you are given too much work. Surely no boss can expect their workers to keep on working for seven days a week, without any sleep? Or at least, if he makes you work Saturday and Sunday, you can at least ask for Monday and Tuesday off! Or even pretend to be sick, my GOTT! Are you friends with any doctors? Ask them to write you a note, to say you have nervous exhaustion. It seems like you give your life and your soul to GATRA!   Here, I will send you some Cadbury's chocolate by telepathy. Mmmmm, isn't that nice? Make you smile? GOOD-lah!   Adios  Matthew, matthew.   Tue, 12 Aug 2003 08:57:38   Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrini lah!  That novel sounds like a very good idea. And your short story sounds very interesting too! I haven't got much time to write things, because I have a lot of work to do before Don returns to the office tomorrow, and Claire (PAI's other director) has just given me a load to do as well. You know, when I return from Spain, I think I am going to go ahead with my plan. To research into jobs overseas - and then, if I have no leads, I will research into English-teacher courses, and then sign up for a course - and then QUIT PAI! I can't wait to see Don's face. I want to time it just when they have done something quite bad to me, like complained, or given me lots of extra work or something. Hahahahaha!  Okay grunge girl, I gotta go  Keep smiling  Matthew Bloomsbury.   Wed, 13 Aug 2003 08:16:03   Ahhh, I see ... what people in the UK call 'the time of the month', i.e. the time when all the women get angry, emotional, sensitive and tense because they are having their menstruation. Although many people don't believe that menstruation causes emotional changes, and indeed, if men make a comment such as 'why are you so angry? Is it because it's your time of the month?' they are called sexist. But anyway, I understand what you're saying!   An open-air concert, my gotttt, I hope you have fun-lah! And of course, because you are famous, you get to go backstage, meet the band, see them in private etc - you can be a groupie!!! :-P  There's going to be a free, live open-air concert in Trafalgar Square at the end of August, to celebrate the release of Nelson Mandela from prison - he will be there, as well as London's mayor Ken Livingstone, and they will have lots of famous bands - a very good British band called Morcheeba will be there, as well as REM! Unfortunately, all the tickets were gone a long time ago, but because it's an open-air concert, I will still go along to stand around the edge - hey, maybe I can stand on the steps of the National Gallery and watch, it will be a great view!   Almost time to go home - have a nice day-dong!  Matthew, matthew.   Fri, 15 Aug 2003 01:20:38  Hey, well yes I did know that menstruation causes body swelling, sickness and so on, although I was told that it affects different women in different ways. My second girlfriend told me that for her, it's not bad at all: she has a little pain and discomfort for just two days only each month. However, from my own observations I think the emotional effects were a lot stronger!  Oh come onnnnnnn ... don't say you are a nobody! Look how popular you were with the rest of the group, you were like the star of the group! Everyone got to know you, you were friendly with everyone, and everyone started to say 'my GOTT' all the time! So you have the gift of being able to make friends wherever you go - that is a very valuable gift, and not very many people have it.   Okayyyyyyy, I promise to try and take some photographs of Nelson Mandela and REM, although because I don't have a camera with a zoom lens, the pictures might be really bad. But anyway, I will try, my GOTT!   I hope you are able to have some sleep in your own bed this weekend! DONG!  Stay cool  Matthew.   Mon, 18 Aug 2003 02:45:39   three days off? my godddddd, what a holiday for young little flower! what will you do for three days? SLEEP, i hope! you really must rest yourself, give yourself some time for daydreaming!  regarding your text message: i don't really know of any quick way of getting the records of calls made to your phone while you were in the uk. my advice would be to call your mobile phone account company and see if they can help. if they tell you to call the uk partner company, then tell me what company it is and i will find the number for you. can you remember the company from while you were here (the name would have appeared on the screen of your phone when you arrived in the uk) - it would have been one of these: orange, vodafone, t-mobile, virgin or o2.  i got an email from my friend in south america, the one that will be travelling to meet me in spain - my goddddd, he gets himself in so much trouble-lah! he has no money to travel with, no money for a taxi from the airport to the hotel, no money for food! i was supposed to be arriving in madrid before him, so that i could meet him at the airport, take him to the hotel etc, but he made a mistake with his flights so he had to take a different plane that arrives two days early! my goddd!  anyway, i hope you had fun and went mad on your three day holiday! a good preparation for bangkok, vietnamese girl!  arrivederci  matthew.   Mon, 1 Sep 2003 08:36:14   Rini-lah! Rini-lah! Rini-lah-dong-lah-dong-lah-dong-my-GOTT-lah!   How are things today in Rini World? I hope they are very good, and everyone is having fun! Lah-dong-lah-dong-lah, Rini-lah!   As for me, I am bored here at work. Every time I go away for a trip, I really hate to come back, it feels so boring and empty - almost like this office is just two-dimensional, while the rest of the world is real and substantial. I had fun in Madrid, although it was crazy ... I met my friend from South America (he is returning to live in the UK after working in Ecuador for a year), who has become addicted to alcohol and cocaine. We went out to a couple of bars in Madrid, and then he suggested that we try some of the bars in one of the dangerous districts ... we walked into one bar, and I quickly realised that it was a prostitute bar (they are called 'brothels' in the UK) - however my friend insisted that this type of bar was a good place to buy cocaine. So while he was buying cocaine, I was trying to have a drink and not get noticed by anyone!   I thought that night was bad enough, but two nights later, he had finished his cocaine and wanted some more. I got quite annoyed, and told him that he shouldn't turn this holiday into just a search through the back streets at night for drugs. He agreed, and so we just had some drinks in a couple of bars - however, he got drunk, and decided that he was going to find some cocaine after all. I couldn't let him get beaten up or robbed, so I had to go with him, and eventually we met some men from north Africa who took him to their house to buy some. They were a little bit suspicious of me, so they made me wait outside, with some of their friends guarding me in case I tried anything. My GOTTTTT, what a holiday! And that is even before I tell you about the three times that someone tried to rob me!   Well, I hope you are having a much quieter and calmer time in Thailand! Stay away from the cocaine and the brothels, lah!  Have fun grunge girl!  Mathias el Bloomzveri   Fri, 5 Sep 2003 10:07:44   Hey blooby grunge girl!  Hope you are having fun in Thailand, going mad and being a Bad Girl!   Keep partying ...  Matthew.   Tue, 16 Sep 2003 09:25:16   asmyyyaaaaaaaaaaaani kusrini!  sorry it's taken me so long to write, it has been so busy here - so much to do, and every day don gives me more and more to do, my GOTT!  glad to hear that you had fun in thailand, and hey you're going back in february, that's great! i hope to buy a ticket to cuba soon ... but it is so expensive. i need to be rich-lah!  don't worry, i haven't forgotten about the tapes, and i have some pictures and postcards from italy and spain as well. so i will post them sooooooooooooooooooooooon!  adios amigo  matthew the cuban!   Fri, 30 Apr 2004 14:42:59  rini rini rini! sorry it's taken so long to email you back. i've been busy as usual at pai, they always have plenty for me to do. but (and this is a secret) i applied for another job, this time in vienna - in fact, a 'headhunter' company called me and asked me if i was interested in applying for it. i had a telephone interview, they really liked me, and even paid for me to fly to vienna - i was getting really excited, thinking that this was my dream, to finally live and work abroad, but finally they didn't offer me the job, they offered it to a german girl that was also on the shortlist. even so, i wasn't too disappointed, because once i got to vienna and met the heads of the company, i started to have some doubts ... they had deceived me about the salary, and it would have been very low, and also they wanted me to move out there straight away, no time to say goodbye to my family properly, no time to see all my friends before i left, so i guess maybe it's better overall.   it's a public holiday on monday, and i am going to see a band with my brother - the 'violent femmes', have you ever heard of them? they're an american rock-type band, a famous song of theirs is 'blister in the sun', it's fantastic, i've wanted to see them for so long. and i'm also going to a music festival in the west of england in august, to see the pixies !!!!!! i love the pixies so much, i can't believe i'm finally going to be able to see them. muse will also be there, plus some other good bands.  there are no groups from indonesia coming this year: apparently there is no more funding for 'transition to democracy' study programmes :-( no more crazy south-east asians for me to look after !  how are you, anyway? are you still working for gatra, and still sleeping under your desk? what about your master's degree in norway, whatever happened to that?  nice to hear from you, anyway, and hope you're still smiling and saying my GODDDDDD!  adios amigo  matthew.
