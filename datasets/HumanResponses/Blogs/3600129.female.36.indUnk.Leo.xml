       I could update more often if not for my dial-up at home  Yes, I'm at work, and I've been swamped and nonproductive. But anyway, stealing a few moments here.   Every time I see a reference to the Army planning to call up more troops, or to soldiers or Marines being killed in either Middle East theatre, I am compelled to drop and press out 25 push-ups. I don't know what this contributes to them, or what it proves to me, or why I still harbor fantasies of striding into the recruiting office and demanding to go to Jump School, even though (1) I'm too old by a little less than a year to actually enter Jump School, (2) I'm openly gay, (3) women aren't allowed in the infantry anyway, and (4) I don't do particularly well with regimentation. Not to mention the shot knees and extra 25 lbs I'm carrying on any given day.  Maybe I would post more often if someone actually    this damn thing.

       What a lovely name for a virus  Oh, it whopped me good, got into me system and went all bam smacky on the hard drive. Suffice to say I'm back.  I have all the letters my mom sent me when I was in college. I distinctly remember opening my mailbox one day and being excited to see an envelope in there--must have been waiting for something from someone--and thinking, "Oh, it's just a letter from Mom." And in the same split-second I thought to myself that there would come a day when I would give anything for a letter from her, because she didn't write any more... No, no, she's alive and well, and our relationship is fine. But she doesn't write any more. I think it was a holdover from her own college days, when she started writing her mother once a week, a habit she continued as long as I lived at home. I miss those letters. I wish she had e-mail, because I would write her all the time.

       Animal Farm.  Lord of the Flies. Abu Ghraib. No one is ever happy with just a little bit of power; it's more addictive than crack or Seventh Heaven. Put ill-educated volunteer soldiers in an untenable situation with nebulous and ever-changes rules of engagement against opposition forces who follow no discernible rules of human conduct, and atrocities are inevitable.  It doesn't make it okay, it doesn't absolve anyone from blame. It's sickening.    Things We Wish Had Legs and Could Walk Around  Our coffee mug. A plate of cookies. Potted plants.   Things We Just Can't Appreciate, No Matter How Hard We Try  Hong Kong comedies. Opera from anywhere. NASCAR. Pork chops. Gold jewelry.

       paint, that is  A weekend spent in snuggly proximity to my sweetie AND several gallons of paint, caulk, kitchen cabinet hardware, lumber, and power tools. It was a sweaty 48 hours. The bad thing about making progress on several fronts is none of them looking visibly close to completion at the end of the day, but... progress is progress.   Things at Ace Hardware I simply must own  Sanding sponges. So many grit choices in sandpaper. DeWalt cordless drill/driver. Utility knife. Stained glass butterfly-on-a-stick. Hammers. Shovels. Magnetic nail-picker-upper.   My New Mad Crushes  I am in love with my table saw (Craftsman) and belt sander (DeWalt) and drill bit set (also DeWalt). DeWalt makes the best power tool cases. Even the drill bit case is big, rugged, bold yellow and black.   News Flash  Went to see the Mexican Women's National Soccer Team play the Arizona Heatwave (semi-pro team based in the Phoenix area). The Mexican players were unbelievably fast, quick, skilled, everything. We got to the stadium area in plenty of time to get something to eat. We quickly discovered that there are no real restaurants anywhere near HoHoKam Park in Mesa (What-A-Place-A). In the four or so square miles we searched, we found three Mormon temples and more fast-food places than you can shake a stick at, but only one certifiable restaurant. Luckily, it was really good. RigaTony's, if you ignore the cutesy name, has a soothingly dark interior with wood-paneled walls, tall booths, and small table lamps. Freshly-baked ciabatta and olive oil come with every entree, along with a house salad (Genoa salami, pepperoncini, red onions, fresh parmesan on greens with the house balsamic vinaigrette). Both were wonderful. The entrees were quite nice, tasty and comforting. I had cheese ravioli with marinara. The service was friendly and impeccably timed. All that for $25 for two.

       can i look yet?  Is the funeral over yet? Has the Right succeeded in building a Trickle-Down fountain on the Mall yet? Still waiting for Morning in America to really show up...  I don't remember being too emotional one way or the other about the man, other than mild indignation that the hostages landed after he was sworn in, which even to my tender adolescent mind had the sniffings of dirty pool about it. One of my uncles was named after Mr. Reagan. I don't think he ever quite forgave my grandmother for that; after all, at the time Uncle Ron was born, The Great Communicator was still nothing more than a hack B-actor sharing the marquee with a chimp. Given my uncle's gay sensibilities, maybe he would have preferred being named Douglas or Errol.    fantabulous folks for friday   urlLink Stacy Dragila , US polevaulter. Mmmm mmm mmm. 'Nuff said.  urlLink Erica Beach  is a pitcher for the Arizona Heat, Tucson's entry in the National Pro Fastpitch softball league. She came on in relief late in last night's loss to the New England Riptide. She's, um, a big girl, not exactly the stuff of most folks' pinup fantasies, but my GOD, can she whip the ball in there. I can't imagine what it is to stand in the box against her, which brings us to...    today's haiku, in honor of erica beach  mountain in circle ball explodes from windmill whoosh! strike three; you're out  fastball in! fastball out! 0-2 windup and pitch! whiff! huh?!? oh man, nice changeup

       bang bang bang   Oh, sorry. Didn't see you come in; sorry for the ruckus. That's the sound of me dealing constructively with living in W's America. Banging my head against the desk momentarily blocks all negative energy from my brain. Plus, it feels really good when I stop.   sighted today:  A Saturn, I think, with a Marriage Encounter sticker, a sticker saying, "Smile! Your Mother Chose Life!," and another sticker saying, "Marriage = (stickman) + (stickwoman)." And a license plate holder that says, "I love my family." Mmmm mmm. I wonder if the driver enjoyed procreating, and if the process was enhanced any by the certain knowledge that she's fulfilling God's mandate to the chosen people?   thursday haiku   brake job at midas pads, rotors, many grease seals kiss the cash goodbye  The post office and many banks will be closed tomorrow for Ronald Reagan's funeral. I find this rather odd. If he were a sitting president, well, sure. But he ain't. Did the country close down for Nixon's funeral? I'm thinking it didn't. Will anyone outside the Michigan alumni office notice when Gerald Ford dies?

      Nothing. Nothing matters.  My soon-to-be-ex-GI brother has been back from Iraq for several months now. He still lapses occasionally into Baghdad mode, driving down the middle of the street and gunning the engine, still with a hair-trigger temper. But what bothers him the most, he says, is people giving him too much credit for what he did in Iraq. Telling him he's a hero, telling him he's brave. He doesn't feel equal to the adulation because he knows the whole story, and parts of it he's not immensely proud of. It doesn't matter to me. I didn't ask him about details. He'll tell me when he needs to.  We're both going gray, the thick dark brown manes we share going salt-and-pepper as we watch. Our cousin, who's between us in age and could pass as our brother, is the same way. All three of us have things in our pasts we're not proud of. We shrug them off, chalk them up as lessons learned, and move on. That's as good as it gets in this life.

      Barnes & Noble is selling a line of classic titles in small hardbound format, much like the beloved (to me, at least) Modern Library series published in the first half of the last century. These are pocket-sized editions with a built-in ("integrated," in modern parlance) ribbon bookmark. They are very satisfying to hold in the hand, or look at sitting in the bookcase.  Why  Emma ? is a question that has come up frequently when we converse about these books. It's dreadful to get through. I assume it's still published and forced upon high-school students because it's a representative specimen of a long-gone literary style. It's painful. It keeps insomnia at bay. It's a classic.

      Seven years ago, almost, I turned 30 the same day my son started kindergarten. I cried. Not over being 30, but over him growing up and away from me. Now he's on the cusp of 12. My dog turns 8 next week. This is the dog he will remember as the dog he had when he was a kid. I went through dogs a bit more rapidly as a child; we lived in a rural area where dogs tended to get hit by cars or stolen for rabbit season. This will be his dog.  My boy is getting big. He hasn't started hating me yet. He's only 12, almost, and there's lots of golf left. But the sweet days of young childhood are behind him now. It's been so quick.   I wish I had done better by him.

      Rose from my lonely bed with aching arms. Maybe I'm getting old. I'm having a growly day, not finding much to be thrilled about, then feeling guilty for not being exuberant over being alive and not having a relative in a war zone, family relatively intact, roof over my head.  I'm still growly.

       Normal, Illinois?  Nah, nowhere near that exciting. Normal as in my normal life, as in two kids in the house, as in... well, as in celibate, which is so totally  not  normal, but hey, it's where I find myself. And now that the kids are back from their summer jaunts afar with other relatives, I can go back to my comfortable delusion that it's celibacy enforced by the presence of virgin ears, or by the exhaustion that heralds the end of a day spent parenting, or anything but reality, which is...  It's gone. Parched clean out of me. Forget to water your plants for a few weeks, or, as in my case, a few months (adapt to anaqueous living or perish), and they slowly dry up, until one day you look at them (in the desert, at least), and notice that while the outer trappings of life has been largely preserved, if a bit strained, the shape of the leaves and the green they had, but then you touch them and discover they have become fragile memories of what was once alive and vibrant. They crumble. You can either throw them away or keep them around as imitations of live plants, what with the residual green leaves and all, but it's a sham and eventually you conclude there's no point in pretending to be a gardener when everything you touch seems to crumble into dust well before its time.   things we wish we could do   drink heavily   things we can't do any more due to advanced age   drink heavily
