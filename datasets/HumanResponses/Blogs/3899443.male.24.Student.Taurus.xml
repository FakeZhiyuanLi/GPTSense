      Mel Gibson's  urlLink  The Passion of the Christ     just won't go away. For those of you completely out of touch with reality, The Passion is the film that is supposed to save humanity from itself and turn us into anti-Semite. I like to call it the film that made Protestants realize Catholics might in fact be Christians.  Well, the DVD of the film is coming out on August 31, so our store is rolling out the merchandise in eager anticipation. This means the reincarnation of  The Passion of the Christ  jewelry. My favorite is the  urlLink Nail Lapel Pin . It's a solid pewter pin fashioned like a nail with the biblical reference Isaiah 53:5 carved into it.  You should really see all these  urlLink officially licensed products . It's one of the most frightening things I've ever seen. Who comes up with all this? And will a lapel pin really make someone become a Christian? If you ask me, it will just make people more cynical. Heck, I'm cynical about this, and I'm a Christian.  Luckily, many of my coworkers feel the same way. We decided to come up with more appropriate uses of these pins. There's the obvious golf tee. I thought it would be a cool nose ring. It would seem reminiscent of the bones you see in the noses of various National Geographic centerfolds. One person suggested using them to make a studded belt, but that idea seemed a little too labor intensive.  Now, if I could only figure out a better use for my  Left Behind  trading cards.

      I'm going "Up North," as the natives in Minnesota call it. I'll be in the middle of the woods with my in-laws for a week. Hilarity will ensue. With no access to the world of Christian retail, there will be no new posts for about a week.

      As my first week in the world of Christian retail comes to a close, I feel I should at least try to put a positive spin on the industry. While those who love me call me a cynic, especially when it concerns&nbsp;all things related to the Christian subculture, I do believe there are authors, musicians, artists, etc. within this subculture who are doing some good things. Instead of always bashing the pathetic aspects of the culture, I think I'll try highlighting some things I like. (Note: I'll keep bashing the bad things of Christian retail. It's just way too fun.)   I recently read a book by Donald Miller called   urlLink Blue Like Jazz .  I actually loved it. The book is a very easy read. It is very much a stream-of-consciousness account of the author's spiritual journey. It's not a perfect book, but I found myself unwilling to put it down. It was just too honest, and I have to respect that. This book won't change the world, but it could make you realize there are Christians who care about the world. I would recommend it for high school or college students who grew up in the stereotypical whitebread Christian youth group.

      We got a large shipment of books in the other day. Opening a box I noticed it was a book entitled   urlLink The Signature of Jesus   by  urlLink Brennan Manning  (who is probably most famous for his book   urlLink The Ragamuffin Gospel . ) I asked my supervisor if this was a new book by Manning.  &nbsp;  "No, it's an old book. They just put a new cover on it, and the sad thing is that a lot of people will see the new cover, think it's a book of Manning's they haven't read and buy it."  &nbsp;  "That sounds a little sneaky for the Christian publishing world," I countered.  &nbsp;  She laughed. And she kept laughing. Eventually, she stopped. "So young and so naive," she said.  &nbsp;  This is what makes me mad about Christian publishing - they are all a bunch of liars. They claim to be about something bigger than themselves (or as Manning's publisher says,  urlLink "That's why we're here -- to&nbsp;change lives for the glory of His kingdom." ), and yet they are all about the money. They even stoop to re-covering books so the idiot public will buy them a second time.  &nbsp;  I'm not saying being in business to make money is wrong. But when you represent yourself as someone working for the glory of God, using underhanded tactics to turn a buck seems highly inappropriate. It's not like they're televangelists.

      This crazy customer got me thinking earlier this week. She was an old woman with a hokey Minnesota accent. She came into the store looking for a children's Bible to give to her new grandson. She had no idea what the name of this particular Bible was, and of course,&nbsp;every Bible I showed her was completely the wrong. She would try to describe it. "It has a white cover." That does me a lot of good. And she kept saying, "You know what I'm talking about." No, lady, I don't have any clue what you're talking about. In fact, I'm beginning to wonder if somebody didn't take their medicine this morning and wandered away from the home.  &nbsp;  But I digress.  &nbsp;  After about half an hour of looking, she finally finds a Bible - with a yellow cover. We go up front to check-out. While&nbsp;waiting to pay,&nbsp;our friend discovers the wall of wood planks with inscriptions. These have Bible verses, patriotic sayings, etc. She finds one that quotes Psalm 33:12a, "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord." (NIV) She proceeds to read the inscription out loud followed by a desperate exclamation of, "Yes, we are so blessed; we are so blessed, Lord. Please don't leave us, Lord. Please don't leave us. Don't leave us."  &nbsp;  It was the way she said it as she looked at the wall. There was genuine fear in both her voice and the way she looked. It was actually very sad. And I wondered, how often do we do things out of fear? Maybe it's fear that God will leave us or that a spouse will stop loving us, but we do or don't do things motivated simply by fear.  &nbsp;  I don't want to sound like a pastor giving a sermon, but it was just all very&nbsp;sad. And I can't seem to forget her or the way she almost cried at the thought of God retreating. A thought that was all too tangible for her. And I soon realized there wasn't a whole lot separating me from her at that moment. And that's the really sad part.

      The first day of work is always fun. You learn the lay of the land, meet new people and try to figure out if you've just made the biggest mistake of your life. All of my co-workers seem like very nice, very cool people. They all seem to enjoy gently mocking certain items in our inventory. Take my surpervisor as an example. On my tour of the store we stopped in the gift section (think Hallmark figurines with a Bible verse). She told me, "If you happen to break any of the ugly things in this section, oh well -- we can't sell them. Not that I'm advocating randomly breaking store merchandise, but some of this stuff is ugly as sin."  I think my favorite thing of the day was a kids t-shirt. Imagine the Mt. Dew logo, but instead mentioning soda it reads, "Jesus: He Died For You." Do you get it? It sounds like "Do the Dew." Oh my freaking gosh, that is so cool. Move over Billy Graham; this t-shirt will save millions of angry suburban teens from their sins. Honestly, this shirt did not make me want to repent. It did make me want a Mt. Dew slushy. Of course, I would have probably gotten a brain freeze as some sort of cosmic punishment for mocking this divinely inspired cotton billboard for Christ.  What have I gotten myself into?

      This was mentioned in the comments section for one of my posts, but I thought I would mention it here for all to see. Apparently, there is a wonderful site called  urlLink Arts &amp; Faith . It's a message board covering all forms of art from film to music to literature and so on. I've only briefly glanced through it, but I can tell I'll be spending a lot of time over there. I might even post every once in awhile.  It's a great site, and you should check it out.

      Ouch. Check out the less than flattering  urlLink review of the  Passion of the Christ  DVD  by  Rollingstone ’s Rob Sheffield. (Warning: This review is not suitable for Christians with an extremely thin skin.) Sheffield’s comments about “The Passion [being] slow and pompous with too much blood,” do raise an interesting question: Do Christians like this movie because it is good art, or do they like it simply because it is about Jesus?  As is usually the case, I am not the first to ask this question. For an interesting discussion of this issue, check out the article “ urlLink Overcome with  Passion  ,” in the March 2004 issue of  Catapult Magazine , written by my old college friend, Kate Bowman. I recently came across it, and though the article is about five months old, I think the issues are still very relevant, especially within the context of the film being released on DVD later this month.  Kate raises some excellent points about Christian views of art, film and culture in general – issues that are near and dear to my heart and my academic pursuits. Plus, whenever anyone mentions the film   urlLink Magnolia   in a positive light, I perk my ears up and listen.

       Yesterday, I discovered  urlLink Left Behind-The Movie  TM  Board Game  (yes, that’s the official title). I especially enjoy the flames of hell that appear at one corner of the board. I wonder if the loser misses out on the rapture and is forced to spend eternity on a post-apocalyptic earth (insert your own joke about New Jersey).  How do you market a game like that? Imagine being in the marketing meeting trying to come up with slogans for the game.   “You’re not just playing to win, you’re playing for your life.”  “Buy the board game or Kirk Cameron will make a sequel. Go ahead; test us.”  “The most important board game – ever.”  “The board game that will save your friends from hell.”   I wonder if they have  Left Behind  lunchboxes?

      The Christian apparel industry never ceases to amaze me. My store is currently running a sale on  urlLink Kerusso  t-shirts. The one that caught my eye is bright red and with the phrase " urlLink Heavy Drinker " in large letters. The biblical reference John 7:3 appears in smaller type below the uplifting message. The back of the shirt displays the verse as a quote credited to Jesus: "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink."  Many will recognize that Jesus is speaking in a spiritual context. Whether or not you believe he is correct, is a debate for another time. My question is why would a Christian t-shirt have the phrase "Heavy Drinker" on the front? I don't know about you, but when I see a bright red shirt that says "Heavy Drinker," I think drunken frat boy not spiritual enlightenment. While there are many things about the Christian culture that make me wish I was a heavy drinker (including this t-shirt), I'm not going to declare it on my chest. (And please don't use the argument that Christians are trying to co-opt a phrase with negative connotations and turn it into a label of empowerment. This is not African-Americans using the n-word. This is Christians aligning themselves with the frat boys on MTV's Spring Break.)  This t-shirt is an embarrassment to anyone who takes their Christian faith seriously. I cannot believe a company with the motto, "Change your shirt; change the world," would actually release this shirt into the public. I have a feeling some cynical intern came up with the idea as a joke, but the powers-that-be loved it and made a t-shirt out of it.  Hey, Kerusso! You're making baby Jesus cry. Stop it! What's next? Are you going to release a t-shirt that tries to declare all Christians are  urlLink brainwashed ?

      We sell these bumper stickers that say, "Angels protect this car."  I'm probably evil for thinking this, but if I ever see a car with that bumper sticker, I want to run it off the road. Then I'd ask them, "Where were your angels? On their cigarette break?"  Like I said, I'm evil.

      I just received the new  urlLink Over the Rhine  live album,  Changes Come , and I can't stop playing it. This self described "Christ-haunted" band has a large cult following and is one of my favorites currently making music. They'll probably never be sold in my Christian bookstore because they're on a secular label ( urlLink Virgin Backporch ), they don't say, "Jesus loves you" in every song, and they play in bars. That's a shame because I think it's beautiful music.   Changes Come  was recorded live during their Fall 2003 tour to promote their critically acclaimed album  Ohio.  Seeing Over the Rhine in concert is always a highlight of my life, and this album comes the closest to capturing the feelings of those concerts. After I saw them last fall, I wrote in my journal, "Seeing Over the Rhine play is like going out for a couple of beers and a smoke with your best friend. You spend the night talking about everything and nothing at the same time. And for that moment, in that bar, on that corner, life makes sense." (I believe now would be an appropriate time to quote the musical  Rent,  "That's poetic; that's pathetic.")  But seriously, those of you who are fans know what my melodramatic prose are attempting to say. In a world where sub-par singers like  urlLink Ashlee Simpson sell 398,000 albums  in their debut week, bands like Over the Rhine are a message from God reminding us that the entire music industry has not gone to hell.  You can only  urlLink order  Changes Come   through the band's website, where you can also pick up  Ohio  or other Over the Rhine projects ( Good Dog, Bad Dog  is another personal favorite).

      Today, whenever I was in the music section I kept hearing the Chris Rice song, "Cartoons." For those of you unfamiliar with the song, let me fill you in. The premise is simple: what if cartoons got saved and became Christians? Chris Rice then sings "hallelujah" in a variety of rather decent cartoon voices. Check out the  urlLink lyrics . Apparently, it's supposed to illustrate that Christians can have fun too.  Is it just me, or does it seem sacrilegious to have Astro from  The Jetsons  sing hallelujah (ra-ra-ru-jah, to be exact)? I thought worship was about reverence toward God. I just dislike the entire thing. I'm even more disgusted with the cult following surrounding this song. I don't usually advocate censorship, but if someone wanted to organize a CD burning party for this song, I'd bring the beer.  That all sounds very harsh. I know some people love the song and think it's just a clean, fun song that Christians can listen too. I just wonder when turning faith in God into a nursery rhyme was ever healthy for anyone involved.  That's one of my major concerns with the Christian subculture. All we do is pander to the lowest common denominator. We never push forward. We never ask real questions. Maybe I should be thanking Chris Rice. Maybe he's showed us that constantly pandering does not edify the church but in fact forces us to devolve until we're speaking in cartoon voices. It's like Mr. Rodgers on an acid trip - it might seem fun, but do we really want to go there?  I don't want to speak ill of Chris Rice, a man I have never met. I just wish to point out one of the many reasons I believe Christian music is irrelevant and in many cases detrimental.  P.S. If you're really brave,  urlLink listen to a sample  of the song (Track 17 on the playlist). Press play at your own risk.

      I had to work today. If you'll notice the time/date stamp at the bottom of this entry you'll notice it's Sunday. A Christian bookstore open on Sundays. I think the world is going to end. I haven't watched  Left Behind  in a while, so someone let me know if this is a sign of the impending apocalypse.  We're only open from 1-5pm on Sundays, because they want to give us time to go to church. Well, my church service didn't get over until 12:00 pm. So I had to skip the opportunity to fellowship (Christian code for talk) to my friends so I could get to work by 12:30 to open the store. Is that really the church life we want to promote? Especially for a couple hundred bucks worth of business.
