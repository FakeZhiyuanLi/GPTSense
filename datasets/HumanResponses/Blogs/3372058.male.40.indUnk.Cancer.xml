      Ok,   I guess I will keep this thing going.   I have to use this to give a faint shout out, or a notice of genius to the folks at HBO for having the best dammed tv shows period.   The past few days I've been itching to call someone a "Hooplehead", or a "CockSucker" ala. Al Sweringen, from HBO's Deadwood.   That show has some great writers, as do alot of HBO's shows. Great writing, and great acting.   I have to do a google on Calamity Jane's character. She could curse with the best of them.   Emma- I miss hearing you curse! I wish you guys didn't have to move to the back.   So, HBO Sunday night is worth the price of Cable all on its own.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  I had my first photoshoot today since my eye hemmoraged. I had laser surgery last week and all was better, until I woke up this morning. I found a nice blob of blood in my vision again, but not that thick. The doctors said it would be off and on for a while.   It makes me sick. I could shoot ok, thanks to Autofocus. I didn't even use my 6x7 because I wasn't sure I could manual focus or not. Lucky I didn't have to drive far.   The photos ( the digital ones ) are some of the best beauty stuff I have ever shot. The film should be a tad better. It usually is.  I can't afford an Eos 1D Mk II, but the Eos3 did just fine, and im sure my scanner will as well.   Check back to see what nonsense I pollute cyberspace with next time.

      a friend used to type her name in lower case. i secretly admired that, breaking those rules.   anyhow, on to yet another deviation i really don't have time for, but figured what the hell.   adult ADD is fun.   i am sitting here, in the dark, too lazy to go turn on the lights, but i am content to be looking at the shadows of red blood cells floating around in my vision. last week one of the blood vessles in my eye sprung a leak, and led me on yet another test of my personal strength and fortitude. thank god for two eyes.  i was about to freak out. i still might.  never has there been a floating collection of gooey blood visible when my eye is open ( left eye, my shooting eye to make it worse ). it is a pain when clumps gather near the center- read "important"- part of my vision. all of my life the eye doctor has said, wow, your left eye is better than normal. my right one is not that great, so hence, more aprehension about the future of the left.  wednesday is the soonest i could reschedule my appointment with the doctors. it was next week ( in the middle of vacation yet again ruined by ill timing, but that's ok, i still have one more week i think.  is this how this thing works? i sit here and try and be witty and get folks to feel sorry for me? don't waste your time, things will turn up for me.

      I had to stop what I was doing at work to make a mental reflection, and hope by chance someone would see this and everyone realize how absolutely Absurd we humans are.   Today a private company launched a small spaceship into the edge of space.   CNN is on a huge monitor where I work.   I just saw what appeared to be the bodies of 4 dead US Marines in Iraq.  I am both joyous at human exploration, but more so, saddened by the senseless deaths.   Most of these deaths are traced to something that has neither proven or disproven.   Beliefs of Man.  Beliefs of people who are too stupid to see the absurdity of our own contradictions, teachings and general disdain for human life.   I am not talking about any one group, other than Homo Sapiens.   Apparently we are all idiots.

      I was driving west on I-670 today, with a bunch of towering cumulus clouds all around.   I was looking thru my sunroof up at the massive clouds, listening to John Beltran, the song "She Is".   Suddenly it struck me as perfection in music, timing, and as the sun shown its rays from behind the clouds, and it was clear all at once.   A tear ran down my cheek, and I acknowledged that, there had to be a God.   No Doubt whatsoever.   All things were beautiful to me in that time and space.   A moment I will try and remember as special.
