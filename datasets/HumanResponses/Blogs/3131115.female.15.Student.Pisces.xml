       Song: My Axe -ICP- Mood: Happy   I'm eating Apples and Cinnamon oatmeal. Yummer dee dummers. Anyhow, William woke me up this morning..hehe. I like when he wakes me up. I'm going to Ashley's later. I'm kind of nervous, because I have to meet her family. Eek. --I'm downloading videos off Warez of Mad TV. I love that show. Have you ever been watching t.v. alone, and laughed, and then got wierded out by it. Grr,  I hate when I do that. But, then it makes me think..about why I feel comfort laughing when other people are around, and why not when Im alone. Are the laughs around other people fake..or, who knows. Anyhow, I think that William is going to come over today and we are going to have Chinese. woo hoo..I love chinese chicken. It tastes SOOO good! Hopefully my dad will get it for me. If not...*pout lip* I'm going to be sad. I woke the iguanas up, I think that I woke them up too early though. Not long ago, when I looked at my clock it was 8:40..and now it's 9:39...It seems like only 10 minutes ago I look at my clock and had it say that..Time is flying, and Im bored. Yippee! The videos are almost done. I supposed I should go watch those now. hehe...If I have time I'll probably write later..if not, I'll write tomorrow. :) Have I skipped a day yet? hmm...I dont think I have. I love this Blog. hehe..I really do.     Im in a good mood...for an AKWARD reason, I am happy. Maybe because William woke me up? :)

       Song: Falling Away From Me -KoRn- Mood: Extremely upset   Nibby has become my life. In some awkward kind of way, him and I have become attached. I feel like him and I have something in common. Tonight, I came home from the movies and a great day with Bill, and my mom says that Nibby is being taken to Pennsylvania. Something shitty always has to happen. My best friend is being taken away from me. He's mine...no matter what my sister or anyone says. I love him. Everything is taken from me..always. I'm beginning to think that Im not aloud to be happy. William is trying to make things better, saying that we can go pick one out at the pet store and such..but I dont know if I want another one. I'm thankful that he's there for me when I need him, like he has been since I started feeling this overwhelming sense of lonliness all of a sudden. *sigh*...I dont think that things could be going much worse. I'm feeling sorry for myself...Im so selfish. Going to go cry myself to sleep...  -Hold on to me, we're fading fast Nothing in this life will ever last Attaching myself is only a curse Dont think things could be much worse-   ~You think that Im a child and I may just be but children are able to have responsibility Willing to give up space to make a new home for something neglected, and always alone Something in common, this creature and I have tell me, wanting to help, now is that so bad?~    Im alone....again.

      Song: What It's Like -Everlast- Mood: Extremely Happy  Welp, where to start? I went to the mall this morning and bought a dress for myself. My skirt's too short and I dont like wearing it anymore so I got a new dress. After the mall, I went to Bills house. I had a great time there, and...we had great sex. We also cuddled for a long time, and I fell asleep in his arms which was the highlight of my day. hehe...I love my Booskie.  This morning I was feeling lonely. I guess that's what I get for not having friends. -Obviously- So anyhow, Ashley asked me if I wanted to do anything with her Saturday. A smile ~mysteriously~ crept onto my face. Of coarse I said yes, Jesus..I'd be stupid if I didnt. Anyhow, so Im supposed to go to her house. I dont know if she wants me to stay over night though..who knows. I'm waiting for her to get back on so that I can talk to her about it.  Update: Mom is thinking about letting me have an iguana, since I've been responsible about them. She explained to me that the iguana is going to get up to 6 feet long, and she thinks the cage will be too big. I told her that it wont, and that my daddy can just make one. She said "Talk to your father about that", so..there's a chance.  I have super powers. :) I let Ashley have my flying power for a little bit, she was flying around her room and, I turned her into poop. :), So she's a flying piece of shit now :) ..hehe. But, then she saved me from her flying elephants, so I turned her back into Ashley.   Anyhow..Im going to go to bed now.   ~As I lay me down to sleep, I see no god..I only weep and if I die before I wake, PLEASE just know that god's a fake!~

       Song: Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades -Brand New- Mood: Mad-Upset   I dont know which I am more..mad, or upset? How can they do this to me? My mom said it so clearly that if my sister didnt let me have Nibby we might be able to get one, and her words were "they're not as expensive as the other animal that you want." That's saying..'we can get you one'..AHHH! My sister doesnt want me to have Nibby, only because she thinks I'm too young to take care of him. 6 feet? My wall is BIGGER than 6 feet..I dont live in a closet!  Yet, I have all these feelings and all these things to say....all to be kept inside of me. My words mean nothing when they're not heard. My voice is heard...but the words that my voice sounds out,  dont .     I have failed .:you:.

       Song: Please Dont Hate Me -ICP- Mood: Extremely TiReD   So this morning I got up to get coffee. I was walking back to my room, and my sister oppened her door, (very early) :and VERY uncommon for my sister to be up this early:..She said that one of Christinas fish died lastnight. Amanda was..heh, not so happy. Deep down inside, blaming herself and probably thinking of ways to tell my sister. She cleaned the tank-a-ma-bobber, so Im sure that the fish was either old.....or had some kind of a disease. hehe, the iguanas are still sleeping. They look so incredibly cute when they sleep. *blah*..  Anyhow. So this morning I didnt wake up at 4:30,  as usual . I slept in until about 6:00. Still horrible, but ehh..oh well. William is probably still sound asleep. I wish I was sitting next to him watching him:(. I love watching people sleep, well..not just anyone but I know what I mean. Grr...Coffee is turning cold. I DONT LIKE COLD COFFEE. WAAA. 'Not Really' Nothing to say..Nothing to say. Im lazy. :)..very lazy. Im thinking about puting a picture gallery on here, for my own likings. heh, William tells me I'm beautiful. I very much disagree. I can't stand looking in the mirror for more than two seconds. If any more time is given, I point out all my flaws. Trust me, it doesnt take long. +But« If William thinks that I am beautiful, that's all that really matters.   I think Im going to work on that, something to keep me busy. I can't be bored..boredom does *big*  and  !AWFUL! things to me. I'll probably write later...Depends on what the day's like.      Where are my {TRUE} 'friends'? Is there even such a thing? Hmmm..Will I +ever+ know the truth? If there is..Will I ever find mine?

       Song: Only the thoughts in my head :and my damn computer: are ALL that I hear. Mood: Not sure of anything at the moment.   Where to start? Well, I guess that I'll start from the beginning. I woke up early this morning, and took good care of the Iguanas. I accidently picked up Niblikitosh instead of Tizzy, I felt so bad. Anyhow, after that..I went to Williams house. Things were..good, then horrible...and then great again. KILL BILL -Volume 1- was EXCELLENT! I can't wait to go see KILL BILL -Volume 2- Friday. William is taking me, being the sweetheart that my Booskie is. After the whole \car/ insident...things were spectacular.   Anyhow, I got home and I cleaned the Iguanas cage. I then took out Tizzy, he only struggled for a few minutes before calming down. While holding Tizzy, I found myself desperatly wanting to hold ^Nibby^..and so I did. After spending time with Tizzy, I took out Nibby, after about a minute and a half of TRYING to get him out of his cage. He finally calmed down, and after holding him for a while I started to fall in love. I tried letting him down, not wanting to hold him for too long, because my sister told me that he doesnt like to be held. Being the nice person I am, I was going to let him be. Surprisingly, Nibby didnt want to leave my hand. He stayed right there in my hand, and let me pick him up again. Four times I tried setting him down, and he just wouldnt leave. So after a long time of sitting with him, he fell asleep so I decided to put him to bed. I fell in love. Holding Nibby was a challenge(?)..and now I am able to reach my hand in his tank and pet him without him scurrying away. I know none of this means anything to anyone, but it does to me. See, I love Nibby now..and I am not going to want my sister to take him back. :'(...One more loss in my life. I should have never got attached.   So...today went okay. These iguanas are taking over my life. My mom is even talking about buying me one, if my sister wont give me Nibby. Im very excited...because, this time..It was my mom's idea and not mine. I feel weird, because other than Bill, all I can think about are these iguanas. Beside the fact that right now, I really want Bill to be holding me. Im always scared to go to bed now. He goes to bed so early, and me..being the bastard that I am go to bed late all the damn time.   DAMN YOU BLOG..YOU'RE KEEPING ME AWAKE!   .:I beg you to listen but you refuse  I give you a choice and you wont choose I show you my tears and you laugh walking me onto an unpleasent path:.  Boredom...I want to call William. It's only 9:30..I WANT TO CALL HIM! I want to wake him up and tell him that I love him. That's mean..and selfish. I dont want to do that, well I do..but I wont. Grrr..I need music.   .:I was never good enough to be a permanent part of your life. Even the distance could not have stopped us, *before* but now you have so many better things to do with yourself and it comes down to this.. something you said that would never happen.. I am alone, and without you ~forever~!:.    Going to bed...Sweet Dreams, to -|myself|-

       Song: Fade -Staind- Mood: Lonely?   It's been an extremely long day. Christina brought over the Iguanas for me to watch. I was quite excited, but I'm not so sure anymore. I'm actually sad, because it seems as if they're not happy. Niblikitosh is hiding under the carpet, and Tizzy is trying to climb out of his tank. Maybe after a while they'll calm down and not scurry every time I put my hand in there to clean up their..yes, that. William got off the phone with me a few minutes ago, and I'm feeling lonely as I stated before. Nobody to talk to, Nobody to care, etc etc. I'm feeling sorry for myself, something I do an awful lot these days. If only I could be a little less of a fuck up, and a wee-bit more intelligent...things might be better. *might* key word.   Tizzy is now trying to get under the carpet with Niblikitosh. Hmm..It's quite sad that when I have nothing to think about I look to the iguanas for amuzement. ~blah~ Self pity..once again. GO AWAY! I haven't worked on my web page in a while..hmm, I forgot about that until now. That was the main thing that kept me busy when I was sitting home by myself.:then too..feeling pity for myself: Now I mainly concentrate on this. ---It's too early to go to bed. I want to sleep, I need to sleep but for some reason Im afraid. I love having a mind..it's what makes me unique +even though I rarely use it+ but thats beside the point...I love having one, but..it thinks too much when I DONT WANT IT TO!   Âhhh! Bored out of my mind. I'm writing too much. Paranoid...Im paranoid! Chill out you beast. Im chill. _Anyhow_-I have nothing left to say. Im thinking about...water. Water sounds great. Im going to go get myself a \COLD/ glass of water.     yummy...

       Song: Okay I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don't -Brand New- Mood: Eh...   Today is Easter. The 'Easter Bunny' came to my house this morning. I got a new shirt,~*HATCHETMAN* FOR PRESIDENT 2004~, and other shit. The Family is coming around 1:00, grr. Im excited about watching Kill Bill Volume 1 with William Tuesday. Hopefully tomorrow, I'll be able to go to his house. hehe, I can't wait to be in his arms. Other than that..life is going okay. Thank "god" that I have William in my life. I dont know what I'd do without my Booskie. I dont really have much to say right now. There's nothing really on my mind at the time. So ehh...I'll write later.    AHHH! Day is ruined. I finish and my mom comes in and tells me the WORST news I possibly wanted to hear. Easter, once a day of joy and smiles..Now a day of hate and frowns.    Cant I ever be happy for JUST ONE DAY?!?!!

       Song: Southwest Voodoo -ICP- Mood: Happy   haha...I just wrote this, and I mean it all.   My heart has been torn and hope slain Memories haunt and torture, energy drain Carried guilt, too far down one lane Blazing sun, dry weather, but no rain  Lay down, sudden desire for rest rising and falling in a pattern does my breast fallen weakly onto the hills high crest what i wouldnt give for one last simple jest at last the sky turns a darkish gray struggling to breathe, dehydrated all day thunder showers replace the sun, faded away take the blade out of the bag, its time to play waiting my whole life, now i can finally cry i cut my wrist for every time someone would lie for all the hellos, and for all the goodbyes my blood now washed downhill by the rain in the sky as I smile my first real smile, I'm ready to die.   Welp..anyhow, leaving now.    The Bull Shit Will Be Over In A Minute.

       Song: Knife Party -Detones- Mood: Tired   Today was blah, as usual. School was boring...hmm, had a teacher say shit to me...which she's going to be in trouble for now. hah..anyhow, I came home and talked to William for a while. I took a nap after that because I was tired..and here I am, STILL tired. I'm actually waiting for Ashley to get on. I just found out that I have to go have breakfast with a very old friend of mine. Grr...She's like 17 now I think. I am going to be the youngest, Im sooo mad. I dont want to see her, It's been so long! Maybe, 7 years or so. Errr...Im scared. Bored out of my mind..Im leaving.    Eww..My arm pits smell. :-P hehehe..

       Song: So Far Away -Staind- Mood: calm...   Welp, today was a long day. I did it again, lastnight..errr. Hid it today. Anyhow, I had a fairly good day I guess. Gym last period was okay, but I had to walk back up to the school from the other school, and when I got on my bus...I had an asthma attack. I was sent to the little school, because it was closer. After scaring everyone, including my mom...I started to feel better. After calming down completely I went home with my mom. It's so scary not being able to breathe. AHHHH! FUCK! Okay..Im calm again. I just hit my foot on my desk, Grr...That hurt. So, I come home and I see Tizzy's skin all over his cage. So, I thought that I'd be nice and put them in the bath tub for a little swim while I cleaned their cage. Tizzy cut up my fucking hand. I was bleeding, and wanting to swear, but my mom was home..so I refrained. Anyhow..yeah, so the water is still in my bath tub and I am contemplatning whether or not I should try again. I probably wont..I tried being nice once already. Trying twice might be over doing it. Ehh...anyhow. Im cold, and tired...and still a little bit dizzy. I think that I'm going to go take a nap.   I want to use this space to thank my wonderful mother. Hearing her voice today while struggling for air, even under the circumstance made me extremely happy. She told me not to be scared and that everything would be okay. I have to admit, hearing her say that took a whole bunch of worry off of my mind.    ~I Love You Mommy. Thankyou.~

       Song: Hey Ya -OutKast- Mood: Lets just say that I am in a very *random* mood...   I'm trying to find things to make my blog better. This is becoming a very big challenge for me. This one, I dont know if I am going to accomplish though. I dont really know if I will ever be fully satisfied with my Blog. Errr...If I ever am, it will be a miracle. I can't quite say that I'm a perfectionist...but writing a letter or something and messing up makes me angry. Therefore, usually...if the time is given I write a new one. I have a habit of messing up with pencil, and scribbling it...forgetting that I have an eraser only on the other side of the pencil lead. Big habit...how do I break it? Could I...purposely write with pencil and erase it lots of times, over and over? Would it work..or next time I messed up would I still scribble, not thinking about it ahead of time....? Hmmm. Should I try? Naww....Forget that. That's a waste of time.   It's times like these where I question anything. Anything there is out there..and it makes me happy. Although, Asking myself if I had a choice between two things makes me feel in control. God never gives us a second chance. Well, if he does it's called a Miracle, and obviously if it's called a "miracle" then it doesnt happen often. Although, in stories..you hear Satan giving you things and in exchange you sell him your soul. Atleast the devil gives you something in return for it. heh...even though I believe in niether thing..it's still something to think about. If there were a god..and a devil,  which would I worship? Well, according to all the shit they say in church.. "god forgives" so one person could worship/follow satan their whole life and when they turn 80 ask for forgiveness. Why anyone would do such a stupid thing I dont know, just something else to think about. I'm boring myself now..Although speaking of God and the Devil...my ex boyfriend once got mad at me for not believing in God. His response after making fun of it was...  "So you worship the devil?"  I was dying of laughter..(on the inside of coarse). But I was so filled with anger for him having such stupidity that I couldnt laugh to him. Instead I called him an idiot,  and explained to him WHY I can't believe in the devil if I dont believe in God.  You know, some...and most people who are religious think they know their shit, yet them knowing their shit doesn't stop them from asking stupid questions, for example the one my ex boyfriend did. Grr...I dont know anything about the bible, or religion...but I DO KNOW HOW THE DEVIL GOT INTO HELL...and this earth 'wasnt made by the devil' I know that much. Stupid people...grrr. Poo on them. Especially Justin. My oops..:-X, I didnt just say his name. ;-)  Anyhow, I'm going to leave now. I'm getting myself worked up about religion..BAD idea. Forget about it...grr..Laura! Forget about it! It's evil...discriminating..!! EVIL! LIVE!...DIE! EID~ (heh..just thought I'd throw that in, because it didnt make sense)   God is fake...and so are you.

       Song: Find My Way -POD- Mood: Sick   I didnt have time to write in my Blog yesterday. eek...sorry. So anyhow, I started school yesterday and then I went to Williams. hmph...what a night. That's basically everything that happened yesterday.  So, I'm not going to school today. I have stomach pains and such. Today is going to be a long and very ~blah~ day. I'm taking up drawing. I'm actually quite proud of my work. It's no good, but for me...it's good. I'm not good at anything, so ehh...the lines looking decent atleast works for me. I had a dream that my grandma told me that I should look at porn...hmmm. Quite a weird thing to dream about if you ask me, but eh. Thats my head for you.   I love William. I think that I love him too much that it's scaring me. I keep trying to ignore it and back off...but I can't help it. Every time that I see him and hear his voice, I want to be holding him. I wanted him to write in this Blog too, but for some unknown reason he doesnt want to. errr...I wonder why. I can't believe that I missed a day, that's too long. Shame on myself.   The babies are still sleeping. Nibby tried biting me yesterday, probably because I wasnt home all day to hold him and stuff. He's probably mad at me. :( I haven't had time to pick them up as much as I used to. Poor mamas. I want to find some blogs that I can read...but I dont know how. Hmm...My next challenge. Challenge=Not finding a blog...but finding a blog that I like. This could be tough..almost everyone and everything annoys me. Sooo...I'll let you know how that goes. I suppose I'll go do that now.   I dont know how to let you go. I've given to you all of me, all that we'll ever be, we share the same. Heart and soul I want you to believe in me. See through my eyes and you will know, Ill take my chance that you will come home to me. Even if it takes some time for you to work it out, I'll be there. -POD-    Inside I always knew, I'd find my way to you.

       Song: Epiphany -Staind- Mood: Sick, and very tired   So I stayed the night at Ashley's house lastnight. We had fun hanging out, or atleast I did. It was cool hanging out with someone new for a change. I came home around 6:00 today..Bill was upset because he missed me. But, trust me..i missed him a whole lot too. It was so weird not saying goodnight to my baby...and not calling him two minutes after I woke up in the morning. I still miss him right now. I want to be holding him. Anyhow..I dont feel like writing tonight, for once. So I'll give the update and some other news below before I part.  Christina said that Nibby looks better, so she is thinking about calling the lady in PA and telling her that she's going to keep him here. My sister wants me to take him, but she encourages me to get a bigger cage which I am going to talk my dad into. So I was quite excited to know that Christina wants me to take him. yay..  Kill Bill -Volume 2- wasn't as good as -Volume 1-. Actually, everything just changes within the movies. I'd score the first a 5 out of 5, and the second a 3½ out of 5    Blah...Nothing Left To Say.

       Song: Welp, CD..Pink Floyd 'The Wall' Disc 1 Mood: Sick..Tired   Welp, I'm not going to school today because I'm dizzy and I have an upset stomach. I didnt write yesterday, and I'm not sure if I did saturday or not. Hmm...I dont think that I did. So, breakfast was boring. I had nobody to talk to..as usual. I went to Bills after that, and then Ashleys. hehe..I had a good time there. I love hanging out with Ashley.   "you got served" err...sorry, that was random just thought of it.   Greg took Nibby to that ladies house to get help for a month or two. I'm alright with it...I just hope that I get ...*HER* back. Yepp, yesterday we found out that Nibby is a girl. I'm thinking about changing her name since she is a girl...maybe Nitosha instead of Niblikitosh...or even tosha or something. err, I might even keep her name Nibby.   Things are going okay..and I dont know what else to say, really...err umm *blah*  Leaving now...    -Is there anybody out there?!?-

       Song: So Far Away -Staind- Mood: Depressed  Err..for some reason I am really attached to THIS blog. I find comfort writing here. I'm in quite an unusual mood. My mood sucks, but it's unusual. I feel alone right now..I AM alone, in my house....but that's not what I mean. Nothing seems to be going right. I mean, everything is right in my LIFE, other than a few very unimportant things...but I'm still feeling like everything is fucked up. I've been having quite a good time spending my weekends with Ashley. I guess that it kind of makes me feel good inside thinking about that. Although....at the same time it makes me feel alone, again. She isn't here now..and it seems that weekends dont last long. I dont get to see her often. Neither do I get to see Bill a lot. I love spending time with Bill. I really wish that him and I could be alone though. His mom was talking to me about how she can't leave us alone and shit, it makes me uncomfortable, but oh well. It doesnt matter. I want to go to sleep, but for some reason I feel like I should be doing something right now. I need to find something else on the internet that will keep me busy and inerest me. I want to find more people lke me on the internet to talk to. :-/ Maybe I should try... I will write later.    It's always raining in my head

      It's been quite a long time since I've written in here. I have a new Journal on LiveJournal.com. That one isn't half as good as this one, but for some reason writing in this Blog now seems pointless. Although, this morning..I woke up with a feeling of guilt. I thought about writing in my other Journal, but I miss this one. So for some odd reason, I feel that if I dont update here too then I am a very bad person. Anyhow, Ashley, Amber, and Sam are over at my house. They stayed the night lastnight. Who knows if they had fun or not or anything, but I hope that they did. We watched Fight Club..part of THE WALL, we ..or I played True Crime Streets of LA. hehe...Life right now is going pretty damn good. I guess I never really expressed how much I liked Ashley in here before, afraid of  someone  reading it..but eh, everyone knows now. So, Ashley and William and I are all together again. This makes me so happy..the two most important people in my life right now. I can't wait to go to Williams...hehe, Im sooo excited to see him. Icky..I have bad breath. I ALWAYS have bad breath when I brush my teeth at night. If I dont brush them at night, everything is fine in the morning. No lie...I thought it was quite weird myself, but it's the truth. Err...I have so much more to say, so I think that I will either save some for my LiveJournal one...or just post later when I'm alone. heh...    Why wont you answer me? Why are you acting as if I did something wrong?

      Life pretty much sucks right now. I mean overall, things are going pretty good but on the inside, everything is just fucked up all over the place. I have feelings and emotions toppling over eachother corrupting my every thought. Why am I so selfish anyway? I love helping people, or atleast people that I care about. I care so much about Bill..and I wish he understood that I really do care and that I want him to be happy. Although, that's probably hard for him to know, seeing as in how I keep saying that I'm not leaving Ashley no matter what. I've grown to really really really really like Ashley. She is a major part in my life, and I dont want anything to change that. I dont want to lose Bill, nor do I want to lose Ashley. I got snot all over Sams shirt, so I feel kind of bad about that. I'll have to wash it really good before I give it back. Her and I haven't been talking a lot lately, I dont really know why. Sam is cool to talk to. I hope that Ashley and I can hang out REALLY soon. I didnt get to last weekend which sucked, badly. I think that Bill is going to come over tomorrow after school..That is if I can get ahold of him and have his mom write him a note..if she will. She's mad at me now, so she probably wont..just because she doesnt have to..or because she just wants to make mine and bills life miserable..as always. heh..not joking either. Sometimes I think about asking him to talk to somebody about how his family treats him. I know he doesnt like people knowing about this...but, pretty much anyone that reads this doesnt know me anyway so therefore they dont know him. If he were to tell someone, they could look into it, and he could be taken from them and put in a better home. That would suck..badly, and...I guess that he can probably make it another couple years. He'll be sixteen soon, so I hope that he can make it that long. WIth my by his side, I think he'll make it. Although, sometimes I really really worry about him. It smells like Williams penis in my room right now, and I dont know why. It's not a bad smell...it not really a "smell" at all..I dont know how to explain it..nevermind. Anyhow...I finished my English Essay tonight, I was so proud of myself that I got it done, and my math. Now all that I need to do is my Science homework and Global Studies homework. Oo yay...School. hah..I wish I could drop out, but..that's stupid and I dont think that I would even if I had the choice. I dont really like talking randomly in my other Journal, then I know that people read it..and I dont want to bore people with my problems...this is pretty much for me and me only. Although, I stopped writing in this one..but, now.....as you can probably tell I have so much to say that I can't stop writing. I dont think that I've stopped writing since I started. Okay.....now I have. heh...figures. I'm writing ANOTHER story..hehe, I dont even think I'll continue with it. It's turning out a piece of shit. Im excited about reading Ashley and Ambers story tomorrow though..wicked excited. I hope that Ashley will help me write this story..she probably wont. She'll realize that she's better than me and then she wont want to write, afraid of making me feel bad. heh...thats okay though, I know I suck..but hey, its something to do. la la la....Amanda Hodge likes bill..and her and I haven't always really gotten along. I guess that she admires me, according to Bill. He wants to be with her, Ashley, and me...I think that's a bit much but I told him that I'd put it into consideration. Although I think that when he see's her and I standing next to eachother he'll change his mind. The thing I hate, is all these girls like him and say that he's perfect and stuff but they dont know anything about him. I could stay on all night explaining how much there is about him that they dont know, or will ever know. bla bla..Im rambling too much. I think that I should probably save some for my other journal. So sorry Bloggie...but I think you're full already.

        Well, I guess that I am writing in here because I have nothing else to do. It's 2:03 am..It's really early. I have a feeling that I am not going to sleep at all tonight. I have never stayed up all night, but I probably will tonight. Bill has Lee over, and I can't get to sleep. I've tried. I'm still trying to find a Blog Skin for my other Blog, the private one that nobody is going to read. I dont even think that anyone reads this one..hehe. I hope not, but Oh well.   Things are shitty between Ashley and I. I feel so akward around her now, and its like..I dont know. It's just so weird. We really have nothing to talk about anymore, and it seems like once again I am pushing everyone away. Not saying that's neccessarily a bad thing.   Hmm..lets see what happened today. Well..I went to school and then I went to Bills. Bill and I watched House of 1000 Corpses. Well, both of us fell asleep during it, but after that we watched a Rammstein DVD. It was excellent. They put on a great show, and are insanely talented. I never really liked them as much as I do now. Bill really does listen to amazing things. Odd...but amazing.   La la la..I have nothing else to say. I think either I am going to TRY and go to sleep, or I'm going to try and find a Blog Skin. Either way..I'm not going to be doing much. Goodnight I guess..even though I'm not really say that to anyone. hehe..so BYE BLOGGIE!

       Song: Anas Song -Silverchair- Mood: Sorry   I have so much to say, but I'm not sure if I want to say any of it. I really hope that nobody comes to this Journal anymore. I mean, I really dont see why SOME people did in the first place..It's not as if they actually CARED. In a way, I am sorry for having a Blog. Apparently my thoughts are upsetting people. I think I'm feeling sorry for myself. Wonderful..heh, no wonder. So, this..once again is my new best friend. :-/...Oh well, I liked this one better anyway. I actually like being able to write down my thoughts without people reading them. and Then I dont have to worry about anyone elses feelings. haha..Im so selfish, but oh well. I have to be able to settle my thoughts and shit, so too bad. So I've been thinking a lot lately, and I really love William. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I want to change my name. I feel like I should be someting different than Laura Shedd, because that name is known to so many things, and I want to get rid of all of them. I want to be like..I dont know, nevermind..that was a stupid thought. I got a new e-mail address, finally. CrimsonTears36L@yahoo.com . I need something new to do on the internet. Actually though, I think that I am going to get a new template for this, because I HATE this one. It's so retarded now. Oh well, whatever. I think I should probably go do that now..heh.     ~i am not suicidal, I just need a way to cope~

      Song: Emotion Sickness -Silverchair- Mood: hurting  Everything is shitty, and I really dont know what to do with myself. I guess though, I really should say that I dont know what to do with my parents. I found out that Cierra is dating a black guy..and I guess she's changing. I dont want her to change. I love her so much. Although, I haven't talked to her in a really long time..so I dont know. Everything is fine in my life until I start thinking about her again. Shit.  Anyhow, Im supposed to go to Bills but I wont talk to my dad because he's a fucking dick head bastard and my mom wont drive anywhere because she's lazy and never wants to drive me anywhere anymore. AHHH! I want to be out of this house. Fuck..I have to go.

      I am really happy right now for some reason. I just got done hanging out with Bill which was cool. We watched Speed which was a great movie. Nothing else really happened today...It was extremely boring. I did get mad at Bill a couple of times but for stupid reasons. Hey, he bought me jolly ranchers and a snapple so it was all good from then on:-P..Just kidding.   Anyhow...I REALLY want to find another skin for this..AHH. I can't find a good one. I want one that's kind of happier than this one. I'm sick of being sad all the fucking time. William and I are actually gradually getting better, which relieves a lot of stress that I've been having for the past bunch of months. Shit is going okay for once. I'm hoping that it gets even better. Although I hate when things are REALLY good, because then when shit gets bad again it's so much worse. Damn..sometimes I feel like I am walking on a road that has the same fucking scenery over and over and over and I only see something new once in an extremely great while.   Tomorrow is my last real day of school, and it doesnt really seem like it at all. In Global Studies we're still learning new shit that is on the final. I'm really really scared about Finals and Regents next week. I think that I'm going to fail all of them. I dont want to be in 9th grade again, that would suck. I am actually started to grow concerned about school. For a while I didnt give a fuck, but I do now. I think that I'd be passing everything if I wasnt so disorganized and didnt stay home from school all the fine. I dont even fucking have to be organized, I just need to stop being a lazy ass and get the hell up for school. *sigh*..I'm dissapointing myself.   I think I'm going to look for a skin YET again. I think I'm actually going to start writing every day..I miss it. I'm sorry Bloggie..I've been too good for you lately. :( I love you:-D hehe..You're the best! (okay..I know Im pathetic..but shhh)

      The fucking nurse called me down and made me show her!! I am so pissed about it..whoever the fucking teacher was that saw needs to fucking mind their own business. All these people think that I do this shit all the fucking time, but I dont. I dont even do it anymore..It's bull shit..Grr..anyhow. I saw ashley today and I wanted a hug...that didnt happen. heh..but Bill and I were really good today.hehe We went to the art show and it was nice being about to walk alone holding hands in school. Anyhow other than that..I'm still waiting for my Cierra to call. I hope that she calls REALLY soon! I NEED to talk to her:( Grr....Grrr....Grrrr...I dont have anything else to say. I'll write more later.

      I'm back..and I say that with pride. My other blog sucks ass..and I dont write in it much. SO much shit is happening. I dont want to explain again, because I have so many times tonight not only to other people but to myself. I wrote this..   I cant have a feeling without being wrong my feelings mean shit and you tell me Im weak but when Im with you my head is strong I dont studder or stop for air when i speak give me one more lesson before you turn away Im finding it so hard for me not to cry I guess its okay if you leave me today I wont ever ask myself how and or why When will I see what ever it is that you teach I just push it away when it is negetive everything you say is one good long speach about how hard it is for you to live You give me my strength that I'll admit but I have to feel on my own when i can None of my problems mean shit and I'm left holding my own fucking hand.   Anyway..just like..basically I am extremely weak, and WIlliam thinks that I cant make decisions on my own..but I think it's really driving my crazy. How am I ever supposed to be myself if I cant make decisions. I dont want to anymore..I'm pretty much sick of talking. I always say I'll stop but I never do..I'm scared of holding shit inside..because I did my whole life. I pretty much changed and bill told me that I need to be able to speak my mind..but now when I do it's not "my mind" and I just say shit..and like, I dont know..shit is SOOO fucked up. I love Bill so much, but I'm having doubts. I'll never be good enough..when I say this bill thinks that I do it to make him feel bad but I really really dont. I have to go..I cant take this anymore..AHHH

      Cierra is still here hehe...She's on the phone now so I decided to write again. Im a little scared now because she's leaving and I dont want to say goodbye again. William just left and he looked pretty upset that he had to leave. Now I'm scared...extremely scared. *sigh*..I'll make it. Anyhow..I have nothing else to say. :'(...I love her so much I dont want her to leave:( She's not coming up next summer either so this sucks..It's going to be two years until I see her again, and maybe even longer. leaving now..

      Cierra and I just went for a walk. We had some cool conversations. She's writing in her book now so I decided to write here. We're listening to "Im Lost Without You" by Blink 182 extremely loud..it's Bills song to me. I love it so much..it makes me sad:(. It brings back memories too. I'm so glad that she's here. I've missed her so much. We were going to go swimming but we'll probably wait until Bill gets here to do that or something. Bill is coming over when my mom picks him up on her way back from work. Now we're listening to "Stockholm Syndrome" la la la...William bought me the White Pont CD today:) I'm so happy. My last post was confusing..:-/, for some reason I STILL feel sad, but I'm happy. I dont know how to explain it. *sigh*..I'm leaving now..

      I am such a bad person. I really and truly am. Grrr...I thought about cutting again this morning..only this time for no reason. See..I'm extremely happy but I still have so much pain..everything changes soo fast. This morning I was happy and shit..now Im not, but when Cierra gets up I'll be happy again. I want to see Bill, I think that will make me happy too. I dont know..AHH!

      A lot is going on in my head right now that I kind of want to write about. Cierra is still sleeping so I have to be quiet. I fell asleep in my bed lastnight and Cierra was like in the crack between my wall and my bed. I woke up at 6:00 and looked at her and then woke her up and told her to move over. I feel so bad. I went on the floor to sleep, but I didnt succeed. Once I'm up I can't go back to sleep. I've been thinking about *you* a lot. I really really miss you, and it really sucks. Im extremely sad. But other than that I'm still insanely in love with Bill. I think he's coming over to hang out with Cierra and I today. I'm sort of excited about that. *blah*..I want another skin..I'm still not happy with this one. I guess I kind of liked the Rain one the most..there's too much white like we said but..I like it better than all Black. I want a really dark purple one but..I can't find one. *sigh* I'll look more. Anyhow...Im going to go now.

I wish that I could see him today but I have to clean so that Cierra can come over. I'm sooo nervous about her coming over. I'm afraid that there wont be anything to talk about with her. Im so scared..AHH! :( Anyway..I guess that I should go now, I want to find ANOTHER blog skin because the one I have sucks. blah...Ill write later.

I hope she doesnt cancel anytime tomorrow. hehehe:) anyway..Ashley, if you read this at all i REALLY REALLY miss you. I loved my hug today, thankyou...Everytime that I think about it I smile.

      Today was an okay day. I had an english final today and then I went over and ate lunch with my mom. After that I hung out for a while with Marrah and Bill and then we took our Global Studies Final too. I failed that one I think..I did extremely bad. I think I did okay on the english one though. After that we took bill home and then I came home. An hour or so later I went to A&W and Long John Silvers. Me and my mom are getting along good now thankfully. :) I dont know what Im doing tomorrow..Probably doing something with Bill but who the hell knows. Wednesday night if my daddy will go pick up Cierra she's coming here until Friday afternoon. Grr...Im going to go now, I think that Ill probably write later.

That was all..why wont he realize how much I love him..grr          William and I had great sex today:-P nobody was in the house and then we were like..just about to grr..and then his brother came in the house. I was SOOO out of breath I think his brother knew..hehe, but it was GREAT anyway. :-p

      I always used to listen to the song "you dont own me" and I feel like listening to it now. It's such a korny song..but it seems to go with what I'm feeling right now. Well like..I dont know. I really dont..I mean, I feel like he tries to make me feel like I am HIS. I mean..I totally am..but I am a person. I love William with ALL of my heart. Every single fucking last piece of it. He doesnt need to keep my on a leash for me to do that. I want to be able to love him as a person..not as his dog. I know he doesnt look at it this way, and sometimes I dont..but a lot of the times I do. I love doing things for him. I love getting up and getting him drinks and cooking for him and getting him things and buying things for him. It makes me happy to see him happy. Although, I feel so bad because when I'm at his house and I ask for food he makes faces and stuff and I hate it. I know he does it jokingly..but he does it SOO much that I feel like he really does that and then tries to make a joke of it to not make me feel bad. I dont know..I love him so fucking much, I just wish that he would see that. I WANT him to be my life..I WANT to spend the rest of my life..I WANT to love him, and I do...He just NEEDS to see that. I wish there were some way for me to tell him that. *sigh*..anyhow, I dont know what else to say.     Baby..I love you, and I will always love you!

      I did it. I read Ashley's posts..and Ambers. It made me soo sad. I feel so alone. I had so much fun with them, and they were the coolest people that I ever hung out with. AHH! I miss all of them so much. I'm really not as happy as I make myself sound. Well, atleast not now. Fuck..I'm so lonely. I need to stop, I really do...:'( I dont know what the hell to do. I'm...grrr. I shouldnt feel this way. Like, I get so jelous because Ashley's ex boyfriend and her are talking..and I shouldnt. I REALLY shouldnt be getting jelous. Besides..it probably makes her feel shitty when she sees me with Bill. I feel so bad..I dont know what to do. AHH! :'( Im so sorry. For all that I've done..I'm SOO sorry!

      It's almost 7:00 am and I can't sleep. I'm out of school, and still waking up at 6:30. I hate this..I hate not being able to sleep in. It's really starting to bother me. Everyone else I know, besides my dad can sleep in like any normal person. Although, I hear if you sleep in you're lazier and have less energy during the day. :-P there's a good side of it I guess. heh..but still I hate not being able to sleep in. Because then I'm up for hours doing THIS waiting for people to get on. By this I mean COMPLAINING. I'll never be happy.  Anyhow..I went to a wedding with Bill lastnight and had a lot of fun. Well, We didnt hear the wedding, because the people werent loud enough, and everyone was crowding around so we couldnt see the bride and groom. Grr..but oh well. The rest of the time Bill and I hung out with Adam and his girlfriend. His girlfriend was insanely cute and pretty..hehe. Bill thought so too, she's wicked short and young but she was cute as hell. We had fun with the two of them. I got a wicked bad migrain but bill's sweetheart aunt gave me pills. I love some of his family. His immediate family..pfft, I hate them. I love when Bill and I hang out together, It really is a lot of fun. It makes us closer. OH! Great news. I'm being put on birth control in two weeks so Bill and I can be alone again. Yayyy! :-D I'm so happy. I finally got it through to my mom that she needs to put me on it. Although, Im a little scared to get a papsmire or however the hell you spell it. I hate people seeing me naked..ewww.   I'm writing too much. I'm sorry. I have nothing else to do. Grr on myself. I want to go to Bills today but Im sick, so I dont think I'm going to. Besides, my dad already left to take my sister and that was my only ride. *sigh* anyway...Im still looking for a skin. I know, it's taking me a really long time. :-/..It's hard to find one that I like. Actually..I found one, but then I couldnt get the code for it, so that was a waste of my time. I really want to go to the other site and look at ashleys posts. I always want to but I never do. Maybe I'm afraid of something..who knows. I think I might really go this time though. I miss her believe it or not.   Amanda Hodge e-mailed Bill after I told her that I didnt want them talking. But anyhow, she e-mailed him and TOLD him "you best call me". Bill doesnt think that it's that big of a deal, but to me it is. He was trying to make excuses for it. He said "well maybe she e-mailed you asking for permission" I said.. "obviously not if I didnt GET one and EMAIL her back giving her permission because she did it anyway" and then bill said "well she probably thought you were going to be here anyway" and I was like "yeah..do you REALLY believe that? You know..She's doing this behind my back" Bill said "well I havent talked to her, she probably doesnt think that I'm mad at her" I was like "I TOLD HER NOT TO TALK TO YOU BUT SHE STILL IS TRYING TO GET YOU TO!" and then he got mad..I mean, seriously..She's obviously doing it behind my back and it's pissing me right the fuck off. I mean I talk to her sometimes, but like..that doesn't mean that I'm going to trust her. She's like FLIPPING out because we talked for like 2 seconds, she might think that that's permission for her to talk to him or some shit, who knows. Grr..People make me extremely mad.  I kind of miss having Ashley around. Not only did she make me happy, but she made Bill happy too. Well, for the most part. The only thing that really went wrong was the fact that Ashley was never a part of anything. I mean, we were always doing things without her, and that wasnt really our choice. We wanted her to be a PART of us..WITH us. heh..It's so weird. Im like thinking back on everything, and how the two of us "met" is pretty funny. hehe...It makes me giggle. I miss waking up next to her beautiful face. aww..I need to stop. I'm going to make myself cry.  Ashley if you read this..I miss you A LOT   Anyway..I think I'm going to try and find another skin AGAIN. I'll probably end ALL of my posts with this same sentence. :-P...Bye bye Bloggie. I LOVE YOU!

      I keep skipping days due to being extremely busy. This week is insane, but I'm having a pretty good time. I went to the mall yesterday and I got my hair cut, and then Bill and I got earrings and went to my grandmas. Grandmas house was fun:) hehe..I had a good time. Tomorrow is my sisters graduation party..hooray. not..:-\. Fuck face is probably going and I dont want to fucking see him. AHH...I'm dreading it and my mom says that my door is going to be locked to my bedroom and that I have to stay outside. Grr..family, I hate them. I have it all planned that I'm going to ask my parents that if I keep up my grades if I can get my lip or tongue pierced..and if they dont I'm just going to tell them that I'll get it done behind their backs, because they said that they'll kick me out..but if they do I'll just go live with bill or something and they wont like that so they'll keep me. Good plan:) welp, Im leaving now. bye bye

      It's been a while since I've wrote in here because I started a new journal with bill..well, we read eachothers. Although, sometimes..I just want to come here and vent, because it's not the same anywhere else. No matter what happens, I always find my way back to this blog...which is going to carry on into my next topic.  No matter what happens..I always stay with Bill. I want to, dont get me wrong..neither of these are bad things, just..things that I question to myself a lot. There is so much to explain..I dont know where to start. Marrah told me that she was with Justin, and it made me upset..I dont exactly know why. I told Bill...we had our..*time*. Anyway, so we were great and now Im just being a complete bitch. William thinks that I'm hiding shit from him, but..Im not. I dont know what to do. I would just NOT be bitchy..but there's only one problem with that. I dont realize that I'm doing it. I love him so much, he's my life..my everything. Although, the two of us are having our doubts. I mean, I'm always fucking up..I always say that I'll stop doing shit, but I always do it again. I dont trust myself, I dont know what the hell I want. William does, which is the bad thing, but then again..its an extremely good thing. I never thought that I'd fall in love so early..and I am so very very thankful for it, but sometimes its just not fair.   He's on...I'll write later...

      I'm writing to update on grades and such. I'm supposed to go to Summer School for Global Studies, but I decided to double up next year instead of taking Health. I also failed my Earth Science Regents so I have to go take that August 17th. I'm afraid that I'm going to fail it again, because I suck at Science. I dont know how to study. Grr...oh yeah, and I also failed Studio Art. So, I'm still a freshman until January. I hate school, but I plan on doing good next year, hopefully. Anyway, I have to go because I'm going to Bills house to paint today...just thought I'd update on school. :-/

      I know, it's been quite a while since I've wrote in here. It's so hard for me to keep up because I'm always busy. I dont really have much to say here either. I really miss bill, and I just got off the phone with him about a half hour ago. I hate sleeping alone. :( I dont want to go to bed. A lot went on in my mind about Ashley today, but that's another story. *sigh*...Life was so simple when it revolved around Bill. Now I have so much more going on, and I dont like it. Not that I dont have fun with *other* people...it's just that, I seem to hurt people, and I hate that I do that. I really dont want to go to sleep, but right now, I have no choice.   ~I'm left here with nothing..nothing to live for..but you~

      I'm really pissed. I guess I'll just come out and say why. I'm getting...fatter. None of my pants fit me anymore..yes, I can't fit into a 1 anymore. (Im not saying Im fat..just fatter)All of my pants are 1's and all the buttons and shit have broken off of them and I dont fit into them anymore. It's not that I want new clothes, I need new clothes. My mom doesnt want to spend all the money that you have to at Hot Topic anymore..so I dont know what the fuck I'm going to do. This fucking sucks. I have no clothes to wear, I have one set of jeans and one set of shorts..That's all..and I'm not exaggerating. *sigh*..Oh well, too bad for me I guess. Whatever..

      William and I had quite the night lastnight. I was up until about 1:00 trying to calm shit down. I really do treat him like shit. I'm such a bitch..I'm so mean. :(  The other day, Ashley IMed me..and asked me if I needed someone to talk to. Sure enough...as soon as I was going to open up again..my computer froze and I couldn't do shit about it. Not only did it freeze, but when I tried restarting it..it wouldnt work, and by the time I got it working again she was already away. *sigh*...I feel bad because all this shit happens and then I feel like she doesn't believe me. Oh well..:-/.   I'm kind of pissed because a week before Christmas my mom ordered a POD shirt off the internet. They took the money from her account, but they never gave me the shirt. I was trying to tell my mom this morning to check her mail, to see if they sent anything about it..but her response was throwing her hands up and saying "I dont even care, that was a long time ago" but I do..I didnt get my damn shirt!   Bill and I decided that we're going to start to chill out more..and if "drugs" will make that happen..we'll try it out. Now..If we start..IF..We're not going to turn out big pot heads or anything..just once in a while to chill with eachother and stuff. Also, if we do start..Nobody will know. Everyone I know who does "drugs" wants everyone to think of that when they think of them..they want to be KNOWN as a pot head...but me, I dont care..nor do I want anyone knowing. I guess I've never actually been 'high' before..the shit I did with Zack was PCP..which just kills braincells and fucks with your brain, so I never really got a 'good' high..I got a shitty one that was probably twice as bad as anything 'normal'..Grr. I'm kind of proud to state that I finally (maybe) quit smoking cigarettes. I still get the urge to, but..I dont htink I'm going to give in. I have 4 left..but, I dont know..I dont really have the desire to smoke. I mean, I do..but I'm sick of sneaking around and shit...when I turn 18 I'll probably start and then I'll do it whenever the fuck I want. Anyhow..I dont want to talk about this shit anymore..it's already taken up too much space.  I'm sick of the excuses that you want me to believe I've been understanding giving everything you need Using me is over now and soon you're gunna see Im done with you..Im done with you  Will there be a difference if I follow what you say taken from my mind and I cant seem to get away using me is over now and soon you're gunna see Im done with you..Im done with you  Everyone is the same quick to point the blame all I know is that life is a struggle I cant seem to escape all the games that you play all i know is that life is a struggle -ADEMA-  That's to a sertain someone..but I dont want to get into that now. I will upset myself. I used to talk on Yahoo and shit..I loved going into chatrooms, and sometimes I miss the chatrooms but I dont miss the stupid guys. Once, I talked to this really cool guy..he was wicked cool, but..I dont like yahoo anymore. I dont like yahoo because guys always ask to see my cam, and I dont like people watching me. It bothers me..its bad enough looking in the mirror..but having OTHER people look at me? :( Just staring at me...It scares me. I'm really glad that nobody reads this. I kind of wish that it was a private journal so that if someone I know goes on here..they can't stumble accross it. I dont want people knowing whats going on in my life..well, besides *you*. This is the only way you'll ever really know how I'm feeling...because this is the only way or time that I put my feelings into words..or think about my feelings for that matter.  Anyway..I'm going to leave..too much post for one day.

      William died yesterday. The last time we saw eachother we went to the movies. He kept telling me how much he loved me that night, and I pushed him away and thought nothing of it. At first I couldnt stop crying. When I called him in the morning to talk to him and his mother told me what had happened. I didnt stop crying...even screaming. Although, I dont know what I was crying for. If I was crying because of how much I missed him, what my life was now, or if I was feeling sorry for myself. At first I think I was feeling sorry for myself, but now I realize that I dont need to. Feeling sorry for myself has no use...I am nothing. There is no me to feel sorry for. I haven't a life any longer. My day began and ended with his voice, and the thought of him. Every inch of my house he's walked through, and pictures cover my wall and my computer. There is no way of escaping. I've thought about killing myself. I've thought of many ways to stop myself from breathing. Although, now I'm just looking for better ways to cope. I dont see myself ever being with another person, there is nobody that could ever even begin to take his place, nor love me the way he did. Every movie I watch, every song that I listen to, he's in it. I still cry, although now I cry because I miss him..but I also cry because I'm so thankful that I got to spend the time that I did with him. Although, I still have many many many years of my life to live..without him, in lonliness. I may end up going..I may decide to stay. Either way, I'm alone. Forever.    *none of this is true..but Bill and I are going through our own little therapy, and I need to change. I'm going to do this a lot..to tell myself how much he really means to me. Although, if this were really to happen..I dont think I'd even give suicide a second thought before giving in. I hardly doubt that I'd write in my blog either..I'd have no purpose. I dont really have a purpose now either, but..William told me to do it..so I did. He doesn't know that I did it though...Goodbye for now*

      I wish that I knew how to shut my mouth and just not say anything. I'm always making Bill feel like crap, and I need to stop. I just want to stop. :( I hate when I do this. These are the times when i wish I had a nice razor blade in my hand..cutting my flesh..but that's all over. No more of that.   I babysat Korah today. It was fun, but she wouldn't sleep. I finally got her to sleep after a long time, but then she only slept for an hour instead of two. Oh well, I had fun with her anyway. I think I might be getting paid, I dont really care about it..but it would be nice so that I can pay for the paint for my room.   My dad wont let me paint it the colors that I want...but, maybe I can work something out with him. I wanted to color my walls black, but I think that I'm going to end up with red or something. My dad said that he'd look up a guitar for me on the computer which is cool. Bill is getting his drum set in a couple of days, so Im going to get a guitar..and then bill and I are going to be in a mini band and I'm going to end up playing drums and him guitar and singing probably. Okay, we'll never end up doing it..but oh well. Bill said that he'd never be in a band with me..but I think it'd be cool.   Anyhow, I'm going to go make a movie. I'll write more later maybe.

      It's 1:16 am. There was a big spider in my room, so I refused to sleep in here. Although, I hate sleeping in my living room because there is just way too much space, and I'm a scardy. I watched scary movies too, so that doesn't really help much. Stupid me. It's really really late, and I just want to go to sleep, but I can't. I'm such a loser. So, now...being in my room again I am going to do nothing but scratch myself in fear that there is a large spider crawling across my skin, bound to bite me at any second. I'm over-reacting. Grr...I'm soo tired. :( I miss Bill. I want to call him, but I dont think that his family would be really okay with that. I guess what I'll do is just lay in bed and try to think happy thoughts, like fluffy bunnies and stuff instead of spiders and things that crawl. Hopefully I can sleep soon. I really dont feel like sleeping alone tonight, I dont know why..I just dont. :(  I'm going to warped tour. yayy, daddy finally gave the okay.

      Okay..now, as I was saying.  Bill and I fight. A lot..I was starting to have doubts about us. Not major doubts, but doubts as to if he was really the one for me. This morning, I looked down and saw a picture of the two of us holding zachary, and it made me happy. So happy that I started to cry. Bill and I have our problems, and we're often mean to eachother..but that means nothing. Relationships aren't easy. I get annoyed when we fight..but I'm glad that we do. It only makes us understand eachother better. So instead of dreading them, I will welcome them. I'm not saying that I want the two of us to fight, but when the time comes I will not be angry. I now believe that nothing at all could ever be a threat to our relationship. I am in love, and I plan on spending the rest of my life with him and having his children. I dont think that anyone could every make me as truly happy as he has. Somebody may make me happy for a few hours at a time, but in the long run, I find myself wanting to be with bill rather than others. I'm always worried about my friends, like "oh no, I dont have any friends"..but at the end of all this and after school none of my friends will be there, but he will. William is there for me no matter what, and I am there for him. No matter what happens..or how mad we are at eachother..We will always be there for eachother. I'm hoping that it will stay this way for the rest of my life, and I have no doubt that it will.

      I woke up this morning to the sound of the telephone, along with many other various things. I've come to an agreement with myself this morning. And I know..somebody probably wont want to read this..*I suggest not to*  Bill and I fight, a lot. We are always disagreeing with eachother.....I have to restart, I'll write about this when I get back on.

      Welp, I got a new skin and I think that I'm going to stick with this one. There's a lot of white, but I actually like it white this time. It was black, but you could hardly see the lettering so I decided to change it. i dont really like the name of it, but it will have to do. This one is set up a little different than my other ones, but I like it. I like having the Archives.    I'm having a little personal problem..I can't really say what it is because it's insanely sick. Although, it's getting better..gradually. I'm really missing William at this point, I kind of got off te phone with him in a hurry and I hate more than anything doing that. Grr..Oh well. I think I want to go to bed now so that I can wake up tomorrow and talk to him. I love him with all my heart. HEEE -William-..:-P.   I'm in a good mood, that's surprising. This Blog makes me so happy:) aww..I love you Bloggie. :)  Leaving now...

      I just read the rest of your posts, and they make me sad. I told myself to stop reading them, but I couldnt. At the moment I feel empty inside, and I'm not really sure why. Oh well. Anyhow, I made a new friend today. I named him Henry. Henry the Lobster. Although, what happened was..my mean daddy killed him and his brothers. My family is so mean. My dad fucked up and he killed them even before puting them in the boiling water because he wasn't supposed to put them in water he was supposed to freeze them. Oops. Oh well..Poor Henry. I'm going to miss you little buddy:-P. Okay, I'm pathetic...so ater my family ate Henry my sister brought me a pice of his leg and it's hanging on my wall. If I ever mention about my room starting to smell...maybe someone should remind me of it.   William and I never have anything to talk about on the computer. It sucks..we get on, and then we're in silence the whole rest of the time. I'm extremely tired and I want to go to bed right now, even though its only 7:45 or so. *blah*..today was a lazy day. All bill and I did was watch/play shit on NG's. I'm trying to talk my dad into letting me go to Warped Tour. I think that he's going to let me..hopefully.   It's really starting to upset me that I dont have any friends. I mean..Marrah is in Ohio, and her and I dont hang out anyway. Amber and I aren't talking and she's back being a stupif fucking retard with Brooke again, but..whatever..I dont really care I guess. I'm just feeling sorry for myself. My cousin came over, but that was just annoying and all she fucking did was want to take my cigarettes. So, I gave her some and she smoked them and she doesnt even inhale, which pissed me off because I have very few left. Yes, I've taken up smoking again..well, I have been for like 2 months or so..but..eh, I'm going to stop as soon as this pack is done..I hope.   Tomorrow my mom and I are going to start walking..4 days a week now. We're taking my dog and walking around Otsinango (?) Park...My mom wants to lose her stomach, so she says that if she does she's going to get her belly button pierced and she told me that I could get it done with her which is cool. I personally dont really like belly button piercings, but just getting it pierced will be fun. I pierced my nipple again the other day. It felt really good, and I want to do my other one..although, Its hard to get the rings in and I have to get better ones before I do it again.   Anyhow, I think Im going to go now...too much typing for only one post.

I'd go through anything to have her back..but I'm just going to shut my mouth and miss her and thats all...grrr. Oh yeah, and I'm probably going to warped tour with bill in august, I'm really excited:) yayy. We'll stay in our first hotel together..hehe. Welp, Im leaving now..

      I know that I say this a lot, but I truly do not want to smoke anymore. I said that I'd smoke them all tomorrow and get it over with and just smoke them so they're gone...but now I know the truth. Tonight I couldn't help it. I smoked...infact, I smoked two..and I was about to smoke three when I started to shake uncontrollably, and I almost fell backwards. I sat on my bed...and I couldnt move. Other than the shaking..my body pretty much had no feeling. I've never heard of someone acting like this after smoking. I mean..I think it's just the position Im in when Im smoking..because I stand on my nightstand and do it out the window like a moron..but it gets worse each time. That has nothing to do with what Im going to say though...I thought I could stop. I told myself that I wasn't addicted. I am. I am so ashamed to admit it, but I just can't stop getting the cravings. I know that when I smoke the last two tomorrow..I wont be able to get more for a long time....which I'm really happy about..although that doesnt stop the itching for them. I dont know what the fuck to do..I feel like when I smoke the last two, Im going to start stealing from my parents, or stealing from other people or doing something. I dont know...it's horrible. Even now, after smoking two and all of that happening, I want more. I want more..but I dont want to smoke anymore. I dont want to want more. How the hell could I let this happen?!? I said that I could never get addicted to anything..and here I am, finally admitting to something that has probably been true for a year now....I truly do hate who I've become.

       Tomorrow I think that Bill is going to hang out with Lee. I'm kind of jelous..but I'm not..because I guess I kind of want to stay home alone and listen to music as loud as I want to. My mom wants me to go hang out with my sister and the two boys, but I can't stand how mean she is to them and it just frustrates me. My parents are going to see my grammy, and I hate seeing her..so I dont want to. My mom doesnt really want to tell her that I just stayed home and didnt come because I didnt want to..but I dont really care. I mean, that is the truth isnt it? It angers me that my mom lies to people to make them feel better..but that's how most society is. My mom got a new car today, I didnt like it..but after being in it I decided that I do. It's nice. It has a lot of space, and a lot of cool things inside. I always told myself that Im not materialistic..but I guess I am. I'm one of those people who..when shit is clean has to be clean ALL the way, all the time nothing ever out of place. My mom had a tiny scratch on it and I flipped out. I mean...atleast it takes you from place to place..I'm so picky..and I'm never happy with anything.     &nbsp;  Besides that, I had an excellent day with William today. We went to Wegmans with his mom and stuff for no real reason at all. After about an hour or so, we went to Burger King and then we went to rent movies. The movie we rented was okay, but it was korny at the same time. We also rented State of Emergency which I can't play because my sister took my PS2 controller and I cant play it with a regular playstation controller. We also rented NBA Street Volume 2 which is kind of fun. My sister or her fiance are bringing over my other controller so that I can also play State of Emergency tomorrow while being home. I'll probably finish off my last cigarettes, and then that's it. No more smoking after that..I'm done. Or atleast until I am old enough to buy them. *sigh*...I have cramps really really bad. It's gotten to the point where I dont want to take medicine anymore. Bill never wanted to, and now I dont either. I never actually really thought about it until my mom asked why I dont anymore. hmm...I dont know, but anyway..I'm going to go call bill now I guess..    &nbsp;  I'll probably write more later.

       Shit sucks pretty damn bad. I was supposed to go to Bills this morning and everything was planned out, when i left my phone in my moms room and Bill called to tell me he was coming and i didnt hear it. Well...so his mom left without him and now he's pissed at me. I didnt leave the phone in there on purpose..and I'm really upset because I wanted to see him. I haven't seen him in about 4 days or more..No..it's been 5 days, almost 6. That's a long time..a Really long time! *sigh*...so he's mad at me and yelling at me, I cry and he hangs up. What a lovely morning. Now, he doesnt want to come over to my house later and shit..so pretty much that part is his fault.     &nbsp;  I can't talk to anyone. The only person I'm really talking to besides bill is this girl Joslin I think..? hmm..I think that's how you spell it. Anyhow..the way we started talking was weird, but she's cool. She's fun to talk to, and surprisingly we do find stuff to talk about even though we're two entirely different people. Which brings me to missing Ashley. I took her off of my buddy list because I figured that it would help me to forget. I was wrong...Very wrong. Although, I dont really want to talk about it at the moment, it kind of upsets me.     &nbsp;  I'm extremely COLD right now..I dont know why. Actually..now that I said that, I'm really hot. I dont know how Im feeling, everthing is just so messed up right now. I'm always fucking something up. ALWAYS...I swear. I'm not even exaggerating. When I say that I'm a fuck up..people are like "no you're not, everyone makes mistakes" but like..that's not how it is. I'm just a HUGE fuck up..and my mistakes are ALL THE TIME! I'm not even saying that jokingly, Im not even fucking messing around. I'm so stupid and shit. I just wish Bill would understand how much it really hurts me when he talks the way he does to me, like Im a fucking idiot. It's bad enough that I think it myself, but having him talk to me like Im one makes shit worse. It doesnt help either...He might think it will help me not to do it anymore but it doesnt at all. I hate myself, yet I'm selfish.     &nbsp;  Life sucks and it isnt fair. I pushed myself away from everyone. I distanced myself, and now I wish that I hadnt. Thats why i HATE when people are like "I like being alone." and shit...and I think I've probably said this before but it fucking sucks. People say it all the time "I like being alone" and its soo dumb! Although, what those people dont understand...is most of the time the people that are saying it have a shit load of friends. What they dont understand is they can call someone and they'll have someone to hang out with them. If they get bored..they can pick up their phone and hang out with someone..whenever they want. But me...if I'm alone and I get bored..I have nobody to call. So it makes me mad when people say they like being lonely..because they must not really feel lonely because feeling lonely fucking sucks and I dont know how much more I can express how fucking horrible it is.     &nbsp;  I'll stop complaining now...:'(

      I feel weird...everything is just akward. I can't talk to Ashley anymore..I mean, it sucks..but...I dont know. I do feel bad for Bill, because I did do shit behind his back, and if he did something behind my back I wouldnt let him talk to the person either..so I understand I guess. Besides..I dont know what I was going to say.  *sigh*...too tired to type anymore.

      I love reading your posts. I read them every chance I get. They make me so sad, but it makes me happy too. I love reading what's on your mind. It's not often..if ever that you tell me how you're really feeling..and I'm glad that you do in your posts. I love talking to you now..I mean, I know sometimes we get that akward minutes of nothingness...but the little conversations we have are worth it. I've been thinking about having you over, but I know that that can't happen...*sigh*  Bill told me lastnight that he doesn't love me anymore. I understand why he wouldnt. I mean..I'm always thinking of myself first. I dont know why that is.  He just called me, and told me to talk. I told him that I dont want to be with him anymore..  He's on..I'll continue later

       Even though its gunna crumble down Ill keep building till you come around Even though its gunna fall apart, break my heart Ill keep building till I die    wait, wait for me wait, please wait for me wait, wait for me wait, please wait for me   So anyway, now that I got that off my mind, I dont have anything else on it. Bill is telling me that he wants a new life, but I understand why. I'm fucking everything up, and I can never do anything right anymore. I'm always making bad choices..and, I always apolojize for it. Bill is like "you say that you're sorry for always making bad choices, but when are you going to actually stop making them?" and...he had a good point. I guess I feel like I have no control over my own actions, and I guess I do. I just need to stop being so stupid.   I wish that I knew how to put pictures on here. I want another new SKIN...yet again, I'm not happy with this one. :-/, I'll never be happy. Way too picky...*sigh*   Anyway, Shit sucks at the moment, and bill is upset and wants this "new life" (without me) and stuff because he's always being fucked with..but when he keeps telling me that he doesnt want to be with me then my mind gets fucked over..badly. I dont know what the fuck to expect anymore. We could be kissing, and the next thing I know we could be fighting. It's insane. I mean, I love Bill with all my heart, but shit is growing hard. I want a baby really bad...and I'm so mad at myself for saying that..but I want one soo badly.   I'm kind of upset about the world and society. I was talking to my grandparents and they agreed that this world is a very cruel and unsafe place. I asked them if they enjoyed watching the news, and they said.. that they guessed so. They didnt say yes, and they didnt say no..just "I guess so". Every time you turn on the news something bad is happening..but that's our world..this is our so called "safe" place. We walk over to wherever Saddam is because he's killing innocent people, but I'm sure that there are just as many innocent killings here as there are there. Think about it..how many people are murdered in a month in our country? How many people are in jail here? A lot. We have no business going over there and sticking our greedy little noses into their shit. WOOO Our country is wealthy...big fucking deal. They brag and shit..but look at what we're spending all our fucking money on. How much money do you think goes into the fucking military and shit. It's such bull shit. To tell you the truth, I've never thought about any of this before now..just that our world was shitty..I never really had input on it..i guess I do now. But anyway, back to the news story, we were watching a news..and this is my impression of a news person. "6 people were murdered today..(blah blah)" *at the end of what they're saying, the flash this little fake smile. The weather man..smiles, and you can tell that it's fake. He's like "We're expecting a severe thunderstorm. Try not to drive on the roads much incase a telephone wire comes down on you" *smiles*..I just made that up..but come on, think about it. I'm rambling for nothing.  leaving now...  "It kills me that we fall apart every day it seems I break your heart I wish I could open my mind instead of my mouth..then you'd know what my thoughts are really about" -me- :-/

      I'm at my grandmas right now. I guess it's pretty good for a change, because I'm away from everything. The only part that I dont like is being away from Bill. I mean, it's good for us to get away for a while. I kind of wish it was him getting away though because I dont like it when he's alone with his family. He gets grumpy, although I dont blame him. His family has problems, and I wish they didnt. Life would be so much easier for the two of us if his family was better. They all need help. Although, I am having fun at my grandmas. Not as much fun as I usually do, because I've grown up a lot...but its cool still. When I'm here, I watch a lot of home videos but all the ones I watched tonight were stupid because I'm a big big big retard.   I'm trading my computer desk with my grandmas I think, and if not I think that I am just going to get a new one. I want a black one, but I highly doubt that that will happen. I want to paint my walls red and then get a black comforter and stuff...Im getting either black or really dark wood for my room, nightstand, tv stand, head board, computer desk, etc. I hope that my parents let me re-do my room. These are the time when I wish I had a job so that I could pay for it. :-/..oh well. Grr  I miss Bill so much..I want him here with me. I get scared when I stay the night here. I get bad thoughts, and then I can't stop thinking about them. My grandma has a lot of plans for us for tomorrow though. She's going to fix my arm warmers that I made, and she's going to sew my shorts and stuff. I dont know what else we're going to do though. I hope that we have pancakes tomorrow..we most likely will, because...we always do in the morning. I cant publish this until after 10:00 because they're working on the site...so pretty much Im going to wait until then..I have nothing else to say.   Goodnight...

      I'm waiting for Bill to call. I guess I'm kind of scared because he said that he thought too much about us lastnight..so, eh..I'm kind of worried. I have to go to my grandmas today too, so that wont be so good if somethings wrong and I have to leave.   I talked to *you* lastnight for a while..it kind of felt good, and then Bill called so I had to leave without saying goodbye. He told me that he doesnt want me talking to you, I dont really know why. Somtimes I wish I never told him, but..I feel better now. Sometimes I think about what had happened if I had stayed with you instead of going back to him..but, when it comes down to it..I guess that I dont have a life without him. If I left him, all my dreams would be destroyed. I hope that you're happy. Even though for some reason, I'd be mad...I kind of hope that you find someone else to be with so you're not lonely. Not like...nevermind. I dont know what Im talking about so I'll shutup.   I've been thinking about killing someone. Stalking someone. I had a dream lastnight that I was a stalker, and it felt so good. In my dream I was hanging out with this person..and he started to like me..and I was like "do you remember my voice?"..and he started yelling and, well..I strangled him. It felt so good too. After that in my dream, Bill and I got in an expedition and drove off..(illegaly) of coarse. The funny thing is..is the guy in my dream had Jordan's physical traits. I dont care about the rest of the dream..but I just know strangling him..whoever he really was..felt so good. But it's not just me dream..I think about it in real life too. I know that I would never ever get away with it, or ever do it for that matter..but I think about it. I've even thought about getting surgery and changing how I look and then going to see Robbie..and like, I dont know..Stabbing him in his throat. *sigh*...stopping now.  I want to go back to sleep, but I know that I wont be able to. God dammit..I should go, I dont feel so good.

      I'm just a liar and that's all there is to it. I lie about everything pretty much..I mean, atleast now I think that I do. I told Bill about *us*..he was mad because I lied to him. Although he sat there and asked me to give him details about the whole night. I said I didnt really remember anything..but, that kind of was the truth. I used to lay in bed and remember every detail..but I guess that I've kind of tried to forget so I wouldnt feel bad anymore. Im assuming that I was successful now.   NegativeWilliam: It's not a big deal.. NegativeWilliam: and you didn't even rEALLy lie.. NegativeWilliam: I just, need you here so i'm looking at you, realizing you're mine.. NegativeWilliam: i don't feel like you're mine anymore.   But Bill and I want a baby...we really do, and there's nothing that is going to change my mind. We realize that our parents would hate us and shit...but, I know that once they saw him/her they'd fall in love. Bill wants us to have a full year of fulfillment in our relationship..before we try. I think we're ready now, but I will wait. I'll wait forever I guess...I want his child. Nobody elses.   Im leaving...I keep running out of things to say.

      In the link above, there are various definitions for what it means to be happy. Part of me feels somewhat like the definition says, although..a lot of me seems to disagree. Can you be partially happy? It's almost as if...my happiness is forced upon me. I dont know if I'm making any sense..but somebody, somewhere knows what I mean.   It's like..I'm depressed..deep down inside. I hate myself, but I cover it with selfishnes..Yes, I am selfish..and it is becoming a problem between Bill and I. Unfortunatly, I dont know how to stop. Maybe it's because I try to love myself because I feel that nobody else does. *sigh*..I just want to get better. I want to be able to say that I am happy to the fullest, although..I feel that can never happen. He may not want to be with *you*...but, oh nevermind. I still think of how beautiful you are, and how good you made me feel about myself. I need to stop before I upset myself again.   Coffee is excellent. I love Coffee...Besides the fact that it wakes me up. heh, I told my dad yesterday to come in and give me coffee when he makes it, and..I woke up (feeling his presence) and he was standing over me holding out coffee with a grin on his face. That's some scary shit, but it's cool. My dads coffee is the shit. So then I decided to get on and write..I haven't wrote in a while and you said that *you* still read, which makes me happy. I'm glad that you do..because right now...and pretty much always you're the only one who knows how I really feel about things. Although, I do have to kind of not say everything incase this blog gets put in front of the wrong eyes. I want *you* to be a part of my Blog..I want you to write posts, in here. It will still be my blog, but..I want you to have some too. Will you? If you will..IM me later and I'll give you the password and stuff.   Anyway..I am going to go now, even though I have nothing else to do for a few hours. *sigh*...Bye bye

      This post will most likely be long because I have a lot on my mind. Bill and I got in a fight..it started out being about the most horrible thing. Yesterday I told him that I wouldnt go swimming with my cousins and shit..and I did and he got mad because I "lied" to him...yet, I didnt realize that the lake was clean and that they had a Paddle Boat. I jumped in the middle of the lake, and rode in a tube accross half of it. Something I probably would have never done if I werent with my cousins. I am deathly afraid of deep water...and I jumped in. The water probably being insanely deep. Im not talking...10 feet..I'm talking..a LOT more. My cousin is also deathly afraid of spiders..and on the other side of the lake across from where their house was..there was a 'slide'. (We're not sure if it really was used as a slide, but it was a large tube leading into the water. Inside the tube were many many BIG spiders..ones that looked like they could bite you very very easily. She stole a step stool thing, and she climbed up there and went down it. She did it, even though there was a LARGE spider web across the hole at the end of the tube. So we both did something and it was nice. So anyway, I had a really good time, and I'm proud of myself so obviously I'm going to get mad if bill tells me that he's mad because I lied to him about it. It's not like I cheated on him and lied to him about it..(again). But anyway..so we started fighting. My cousin, dresses in short shorts and skimpy shirts and she's one of (those) kinds of people...yet, she listens to some music that I listen to. I was telling Bill that, and he called her a Poser. He's never met her before..but he called her a poser..and this is why I am mad. People like "bill" and.. 'me'...and everyone who dresses at hot topic and shit think they have the right to call people posers. I never hear any so called "preppy" people call anyone posers, because they dont give a shit. But Bill had the nerve. He's like "they dont feel the music. They love themselves so it angers me" "they shouldnt be listening to that kind of music if they love themselves because most of the people singing that they listen to sing about hating themselves so they cant feel it"...but I think he's wrong. I guess being one of (those) people my entire life..I understand better than Bill ever will. When I was like that, I hated myself. he thinks that all these "preppy" girls Love themselves and shit..but I know different. I'm not saying all dont..because a LOT of girls do love themselves and are infact conceided..but some are not. I guess I pretty much HAD to love myself back then..I didnt really, I hated who I was..but I was forced to be "selfish"...I had to love who I was because nobody else accepted me any different. When I was popular..I had to do shit for it. I had to do shit for people to like me..I had to be good looking for people to like me. Yeah, I was good looking back then..but when I didnt do anything with myself people told me that I was ugly. Do you think it was easy? No..It wasnt. And I'm not talking like...little school and stuff. I'm talking middle school..5th 6th 7th and half of 8th grade..that's what I was. It wasnt easy for me...and I didnt like it. When I was dating Justin, and best friends with Cierra, i hated myself..and they were the first people that I told openly. I mean, Amber and Marrah knew that I hated myself, because I always said it..but people on the outside think Im happy..no shit, I put on a fake smile. I'm sure a lot of "popular" "preppy" girls feel the same way I did..if not then I must have been crazy. But Bill will never understand..He will never ever know what it's like. Nobody like "him" really thinks about it either...they just think they're better than everyone else and think that they have the right to call everyone else a poser. haha...they HATE themselves yet they make themselves feel like they're BETTER!! Everyone-even popular people strive to be something better..yet they say they dont. Especially people like "us"..we are the devil. It is people like us who are picky, and dont let things go..and judge everyone else yet say we dont. On vampirefreaks.com all the girls are like Dislikes: Stupid people, ignorant people...yet they're judging people..and being ignorant themselves. It's like..they go out of their way to let people know that they hate stupid people. They may not THINK that they want people to think BETTER of them...but they do. Everyone thinks their cool...especially people like "us" not all of us..because some of us really do hate ourselves...but most.   I told my cousin about *you*..and she seemed kind of disgusted, but I dont really care. That doesnt bother me..we live two different lives..although she's still cool. She may be a tad bit close minded, but I dont blame her..I blame the people she hangs out with. i know that if she hung out with me for a while..she wouldnt think that way anymore. It's all in who you grow up with. I know that's not supposed to make a difference, and you're just supposed to be who you are..but you learn who you are from someone...you dont just all of a sudden know things. I mean, music wise too...our teachers and parents (well most) dont teach their kids about which music to listen to..and what it means...and all that shit.   Anyway..my thoughts are being put to rest, because I am going to see Bill...I dont know what it's going to turn into..but I'm going to see him today..

      I accidently didnt write when i wrote that last post...so basically what I wanted to say about it..is that the lyrics are good, and I dont care what anyone says about it..It's a good song. It's an old one that I listened to with my dad when I was little, but I never understood what it was about until about a year ago.&nbsp; And now I understand just what it means..

      Saying I love you Is not the words I want to hear from you It's not that I want you Not to say, but if you only knew How easy it would be to show me how you feel More than words is all you have to do to make it real Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me 'Cause I'd already know &nbsp; What would you do if my heart was torn in two? More than words to show you feel That your love for me is real What would you say if I took those words away? Then you couldn't make things new Just by saying I love you &nbsp; More than words..... &nbsp; Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand All you have to do is close your eyes And just reach out your hands and touch me Hold me close don't ever let me go More than words is all I ever needed you to show Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me 'Cause I'd already know &nbsp; What would you do if my heart was torn in two? More than words to show you feel That your love for me is real What would you say if I took those words away? Then you couldn't make things new Just by saying I love you &nbsp; More than words.....

       .."so go get your knife(go get your knife)   and come in go get your knife(go get your knife)   and lay down   go get your knife(go get your knife)&nbsp;and kiss me   I can float here forever   in this room   we cant touch the floor   in here we're all anemic   in here..anemic and sweet so   go get your knife(go get your knife)   and come in go get your kinfe(go get your knife)   and lay down   go get your knife(go get your knife)now kiss me.."   -DEFTONES-  &nbsp; Zachary left and so did Bill. I dont really want to leave today now, because I know that I'm going to be left out and there's going to be nothing to do. I'm so much different than everyone. I'm not the same as I used to be. *sigh*..Nobody there is like me..not anyone, and..I feel horrible now. I want to be with bill. I do..I want to be at his house cuddling and sleeping with him. AHH! I made another stupid decision. i dont want to make decisions anymore..I hate when I do it. I always make the wrong ones. I hate myself..:( &nbsp; I miss *you*..:(

       "..And it breaks my heart to know the only reason you are here now is..   A reminder of what I'll never have   I'll never have...I'll never-   Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in   Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in.."   -From Autumn to Ashes-  &nbsp; I'm in a lot of pain now. Not only emotional pain, but physical too. I feel like I'm going to puke...and my head hurts. I keep swollowing, because I feel like there is puke coming into my mouth. Yesterday Bill continued to tell me that he did not want me to come to him house (today)..so, I made plans with my mom to go see my cousins. It's been about 3 years since I've talked to them last, I've always been angry at them for past reasons..but my mom says that they've changed and that they've been asking to see me. I do feel kind of bad because I never go and see my family anymore. So I decided to go with her today, and do something with my family for a change. I hate when Bill gets mad about this..I called him this morning and told him that I was going Of coarse, because I'm doing something without him..he got mad and wants me to go to his house. I told him that the only reason I did this was because he told me that he doesnt want me coming over..and in the process, he hung up on me.  &nbsp; Justin, for some reason called me&nbsp;on the phone lastnight..and it bothered me. He kept saying "son" and "pimp" and telling me that he's turning prep and all this other shit. I was trying to talk to him about something, something that I wanted him to understand and he did nothing but try to turn things around..and I was like.. "justin, stop assuming and just listen" and no matter what, he didnt understand and like everyone else just waited for his turn to talk..and didnt even care about anything I had to say..yet he tells me that he loves me. Grr...I hung up on him. Which I am now VERY thankful for, I can't deal with it anymore.  &nbsp;  "I could be mean..   I could be angry..   you know i could be JUST LIKE YOU...   I could be fake..   I could be stupid..   you know i could be JUST LIKE YOU..."   -Three Days Grace-  &nbsp; Shit just sucks so bad. I talked to another guy (an old one) and he actually gave me hope for the future..something I never thought that I'd have again. His wife died in his arms. She was in labor..and had triplets, but died in the process. So this guy..has triplets, and I dont think he will ever take his children for granted..or anything in life for granted again.&nbsp; He told me that he re-lives the night that his wife died, every night before he sleeps. He said it was so hard, but it gets easier to manage...and it gave me some hope. I know I sound stupid..but by the end of our conversation..I was in tears.  &nbsp;  "Will you still hold me when you see what I have done?   Will you still kiss me the same   when you taste my bitter pride..?"   -Atreyu-  &nbsp; Anyhow..My mom and I are going to pick Zachary up at 10:00. I'm really excited about watching him, but bill doesnt want to come. Grr.. &nbsp;  "I was never good at hiding anything   My thoughts break me   Do you understand what you mean to me?   You are my faith.."    &nbsp;  "When&nbsp;I sit and think of the days we shared   and the nights you covered for me   Every little thing that I ever did   you would stand by me   Every time you cried it would take my wind   My heart would break   if I could be strong like you were for me   YOU ARE MY FAITH!.."   -COLD-  &nbsp; I should probably start getting ready..but&nbsp;I can't stop listening to music. Sometimes I wish that I could be locked in a room-forever. Although, I just wish that I could have all the music that I love, and be able to listen to it as loud as I want..and have a very very nice stereo system in it..and have NOBODY able to hear me..and stay in there..forever, until I die. Then...in my little cell or whatever it was..With sound-proof walls and doors and such..in my "cell"...I know that I would be safe. I know..I'm stupid, but that is my   wish  .  &nbsp; I have to go get ready... &nbsp;

      Sometimes I wonder if you're really happy  or if you  cherish  the things that we do  I have my doubts that you are content  and I'm not sure if I'm happy with you  It's seems that so often we're pushing away  and we struggle so hard not to yell  We get angry so fast that it angers me more  and it upsets you too, I can tell  Sometimes I dont like being touched  and I dont know what the cause of that is  I tell you that it's just lack of comfort  and then I cover it up with a kiss  But, I dont really know what else it could be  I really dont know what to think anymore  It seems that every time we are happy  one of us is always asking for more  It's not only me doing the pushing  when you're angry you push me away too  it hurts me inside, and I feel this way  This way that I so often do..  I'm not having any doubts about us  nor do I think that we wont last  but I'm scared that you'll leave me someday  after all that I've done in my past  I feel like every time something is wrong  you think of the past and get mad  I dont know why Im the one always wanting more  because you're the best thing that I've ever had  I want to try and make everything better  and I dont want you to think anything else  I dont want us to break up, and I dont want anything more  all I want to do is just help  I know you're depressed, but you wont admit it  I know you think you cant get help, but you can  medication can take some of it away  but you dont want that and I somehow understand  I'm not saying it's your fault how you feel  because it's not your fault and we know that its true  but medication can help calm your "hormones"  and it will help our relationship too  I think you should try and get better  because being sad all the time isn't good  I'd like to be hugging and kissing you now  and every second that I possibly could  I want you to be happy, and stay that way  I dont want you to be sad anymore  I want us to love and  cherish  eachother  like we did for so long before... &nbsp; &nbsp; I  cherish  so many  memories ...

      I'm sorry for all the things that I've done  The guilt is too strong for me to throw away  Causing pain is all I seem to know how to do, (just one)  Ill take (just one) last breath and wish the best for you   The blade is rusted, and  so is my heart  As I cut my wrist..I come apart   The blade is rusted, and  so is my heart  As I cut my wrist..I come apart   You will come to know that this is for the best  I know that you'll cry but you'll soon forget  The blade calls my name, my only friend  I wont have the chance to hurt you again   The blade is rusted, and  so is my heart  As I cut my wrist..I come apart   The blade is rusted, and  so is my heart  As I cut my wrist..I come apart   I look inside your blue-ish eyes just one last time  into your heart that is forever mine  I see your pain, but there's so much more  something I have never noticed before   I know now what I mean to you, the hate is so much thinner  I thought this blade would help me out and let me be a winner  Inside your heart, is filled with love and I see now its immense  I will not hurt you anymore, I cherish your forgiveness   The blade is rusted, and  that's how it stays  As I set it down..I walk away -me- &nbsp; I know it sucks..and it needs some work, but thats okay. That's the first thing that I've written in a really long time. *sigh*..anyway, leaving now...

      I dont know where to start. I haven't been writing a lot in my posts in the past few days. Today, I spent my day with William and I had a great time. Yesterday I pretty much just chilled, and I talked to an old friend which..probably wasn't such a great idea. If bill found out he'd kill me..but it all happened by mistake to begin with. Oh well...anyhow so I talked to him. We used to like eachother and now his feelings are back. I kind of feel bad..I dont like him anymore, but he's a cool friend. He listened to me talk, and cry...and I felt weird because I've never personally met him. We met through other friends and he lives about an hour or so away.   Anyway...Tomorrow my mom and I are going to watch a little girl named Autumn which is such a beautiful name. *FROM AUTUMN TO ASHES* hehe...sorry, that was random..great band anyway...but Autumn is two. Tuesday Bill and my mom and I are going to watch Zachary hehe.. Which is awesome. I love Zachary so much. Bill put him to sleep tonight and was singing to him when he was crying and he got all better, and it made me want a baby more because he'd be a great father.  &nbsp; I've been thinking about *you* a lot lately...A lot of the times when Im with Bill. I feel bad saying that..I doubt that you even read these anymore..I wouldn't blame you if you didnt. I've been such a shit head and stuff. I haven't talked to Bill about letting us talk, I guess I've been avoiding it because I know how it is all going to turn out. Oh well..anyhow..*sigh*.. &nbsp; I just wrote a whole thing..but didnt want to post it. :-/, Im going to go now....bye bye

      My day was okay. Although Bill and I kept wondering what Ashley was doing all day long, but oh well. It seems weird to him and I that every morning we tell eachother what we're doing, and some days go by and we have no idea what Ashley plans on doing or anything. I think it's going to take getting used to again. I dont know if she realizes that everything that Bill and I do, she's invited. Maybe she doent know that, I dont know. It's weird hanging out with someone who has a life. I've been with Bill so long, I'm the center of his world..but with Ashley there are so many other people to 'worry' about. :-P..It's going to take time, but I'll get used to it. hehe...Anyway, i miss her so much. She IMed me saying that she probably wasnt going to be on for the rest of the night, and it worried me. :( I wont be able to say goodnight and sweet dreams back. I slept with Darwyn lastnight, hehe..I've never slept with him before and I've had him since 6th grade. He's been sitting in a closet ever since I got him...he was extremely expensive and I never even did anything except sit him in a closet for a couple of years. hehe...I'm happy that Ashley is going to take him. :-D It makes me so happy. I'm going to try and put the picture on here of Ashley and Darwyn, even though she hid, AGAIN. Welp, I'm going to go and try to put that on here:)  I MISS YOU ASHLEY! I CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN...xoxoxo

      I hate myself, and I deserve to die. I'm not even kidding...right now, I'm about to puke and I'm in pain. Like..I've said this a lot, but I want to die. More so, I want to run away. I'm going to puke. I've been doing shit behind Bills back, and I am going to call him and tell him that I cant be with him anymore....

      Nothing good is really happening I guess. Shit is just kind of *BLAH* lately...I'm going to the fair with Bill tomorrow (I think)..That should be fun I guess. I'm always afraid of being beat up at the fairs...haha, I get really nervous when I go. I guess it's okay though, everyone likes Bill...so I dont think that I have enemies anymore. I used to have atleast 3 enemies at one time..and somebody always had to give me a dirty look. I remember some stupid clown guy that critisized people, and he made fun of me and Danielle Hand...(yes, I was friends with her at one point)..I got really mad though..Why? I dont know.   I'm listening to The Pixies..hehe, for some reason I've come to love listening to their song called 'Where is My Mind' I belive that's the name...I'm not sure though. I watched the end of Unbreakable today...it's an AMAZING movie. I love it how all the good directors and actors work together, and they're usually about the same people in totally different movies and it's awesome. I was going to watch American History X again today, but I decided to watch Jackass instead because I didnt have enough time, and Jackass is fucking funny. It would have been so cool to see 'ZACKASS'..which was something that Zack Zabor and Bill were going to do...It would have been insanely funny. I wish that they would still do it.   I was picking fleas off of Bills puppy today. I dont know why I said that..I guess that just popped into my head for some unknown reason. Actually, now that I think about it, I was itching (or scratching as most people say) my arm, and that made me think about it. I came to realize right now, that usually when something pops in my head, something triggers it. Like...I always say random things, but I guess that they aren't random to me..just to the other person. I feel soooo dirty this summer. I'm always with Bill really early in the morning and really late at night, so I never have time to take showers. I feel so insanely dirty. I mean, yeah..I make time and all..but this summer, I went 3 days without taking a shower...EWWW! The thing is, is that I dont even realize it either..it's like...shit is going by so fast now. I remember when it was like just starting July, and now it's almost August. Still one full month to go of summer. That seems like a really long time, but I guess that it's not.   Leaving..:'(

      I know that it's been a really long time since I've updated. A lot has been going on. I dont even know how to express how much I've had to go through throughout the past couple of days. For a while I've been having feelings about my ex-boyfriend Justin...thoughts of being with him and not William. Everytime that I was with Bill, I was thinking about Justin and my stomach would hurt whenever I was around him. So..I told him. I sat down with him and told him everything, about how I was still thinking about Justin and how part of me wanted to be with him. Bill was very good about it actually, and it ended up being a great day in the end. I dont want to really get into details..just that I told Bill that I couldnt be with him anymore, and then I realized how much Bill is there for me and how much that Justin couldnt be. I left Justin messages on yahoo, (which bill told me NOT to do) but I did..I had to, and I'm glad that I did..because now I feel so much better about being with Bill. Justin and I talked this morning before Bill came over, and he told me that I've changed too much and that I'm not the girl for him anymore. I have a feeling that he was saying this because he wanted to make it easier for me...because when he left he was like "whatever"&nbsp;when I told him goodbye. I told him that I knew now that he would always hold a grudge because I changed...that no matter what, he would always be wishing that I was who I used to be. I believe it now. It's so hard for me though, because..I'll still always think of him as who he was and who I was before he left. I was happy with him, and I'll always remember that...my mind wont ever let me think of the bad things about him. Although, I'm happy with Bill now..we had a very short, but tremendously great day.  Now this brings me to *you*..I miss you. I'm really really thinking about asking Bill to let me talk to you now since Bill and I can actually talk without flipping out on eachother. Our relationship is so much better now. *sigh*, I really want to talk to you. Just our hellos and goodnights meant so much to me. I know that we didnt talk much, and when we did it was all random, but I cherish the random shit. I cherish our memories...Every time I look at my bed I think about you. It hurts..a lot, but I'm getting through it. I had so many great times with you, and you were one of the BEST friends that I've ever had...even better than Cierra, and Cierra was the best. So pretty much besides Bill, you were my best friend. I wish we had had more times to hang out and such. I wish that I could promise Bill that nothing would happen between us if we hung out, because maybe then he'd let us hang out. But anyway...  I dont know what else to write about.&nbsp;I guess there really isn't anything to say anymore. I know that it makes me so jelous when *you* talk about your friends in your posts. It hurts, because I dont have anyone. I'm not even kidding..I haven't hung out with anyone except for my cousin this summer..and that was only twice. I have no friends..and I miss having friends. *sigh*..oh well. You deserve to have friends...you deserve everything.   "The Street Lights Flicker Like This Match In My Hand(x3).. Beggin' To Strike(x2)...." -From Autumn To Ashes-

      For some reason, I dont feel right.  Something is wrong and I'm feeling shitty.  I had Bill punch me yesterday so that I would bruise...but there is no bruise. I don't bruise easily, and I guess that's why I strive to have a bruise somewhere on my body. You see..bruises to me, are probably the most beautiful thing. I know that sounds dumb..and everyone is like "bruises are ugly"...but they are so beautiful to me. The scars on my arms comfort me. Every time that I look at my arm, I see my scars and they too are very beautiful. Nothing on my body is as beautiful as my scars. I just looked at myself in the mirror...and I almost want to cry. It seems that every time I look in the mirror I'm looking face to face with my enemy. I know that sounds weird it's just that...I can't stand living with who I am. Yeah, like...I have people, like Bill and Ashley for example but neither of them understand how truly bad I feel for letting them become involved with me. I am lucky to have the two of them in my life.  Inside my head I hear screaming Someone's screaming at me, I wonder if I'm dreaming but I blink and find myself lonely The yelling continues and I cry tears falling fast I try and comfort myself with a lie only the lie doesnt last I search for help but the voice doesnt fade When will it leave? I stand still trying to fight, to be brave but inside I just want to bleed I try to find this voice that I hate so I walk into another place I go into the bathroom and look straight Staring at my enemy...face to face.  I just wrote that....umm, but I have to go now. I....can't really write anymore, I'm just in one of 'those' moods where silence seems conforting.

      I wish that I could make things all better. I think the only thing good about this summer is going to Warped Tour. I can't wait to go to Warped Tour. I'm surprised that my parents are lettting me go. It's just going to be Bill and I hanging out all day because my sister and her fiance are going to be at Six Flags the whole day. ..I'm not writing anymore I stopped writing and forgot I was writing..:-P

      Well scratch all my plans for today. :(....Bill's mom is being a bitch yet again and wont come get me. She wanted Bill to say goodnight to some guy on the internet for her, and Bill wouldn't because I IMed him and was upset. She didnt care that I was upset, just that she wasnt getting what she wanted. She's like "well you too were fighting anyway" (which we werent) but even if we were..she acts like because we were fighting Bill shouldnt care what's wrong with me. Its like...she's so bitchy. She goes to Bill "I'm not doing anything for you, I'm sick of it!" and he goes "then I'm not doing anything for you" and she said "what do you do for me?" and he does a lot of her...He does like anything that she wants him to do and its fucking bull shit. She's such a whore..she's not even a mother. I swear to god if I could let Bill live with me I would, because his mom is such a fucking bitch. I have NEVER known anyone as fucking bitchy as her. GOD! I wish that I could shoot her in the mother fucking head. AHHH! Because she didnt get her fucking way everything that I had planned today is fucked up. I didnt see him yesterday, and I can't see him tomorrow either. I fucking hate his family. It's so dumb because my mom does shit for me all the fucking time and doesnt expect anything back..but Bills mom WONT do anything for him unless he does something for her first. She's selfish...she doesn't know what a mother is. She should have been careful or something when she was having sex with his dad..because she should NOT have had children. My mom ALWAYS puts me before her. You will never see my mom going out and buying herself something unless she gets me something first. His mom...always gets herself stuff and lies to him and says that she has no money so that he can't get anything. It was storming one night and she's like "I have to get home, I have a baby..I can't die, I have to take care of him." and shit....but like, if it were my mom driving she would have said "I need to get you two home..I dont want you two riding around in this kind of weather"..anyway, I'll stop complaining. :( GOD i hate her. Errrrg...anyway, yeah..so I'll update later on I guess..

      I spent almost all day yesterday doing me hair and then I ended up taking it out. I put like electrilcal tape over it and shit...and it hurt like hell sleeping with it in, and it hurt like hell taking it out. Grrrr...It didnt turn out to look how I thought it would. Oh well though...whatever. I guess that I'm stuck with having short hair...*sigh*Anyway...I can't wait to go to Bill's today. It's going to be awesome because we're home alone for a couple of hours. We'll most likely be practicing forour new band 'All Hope Denied'..Bill says that he's going to teach me how to play the drums and that's going to be our new band..but haha....I can't do the simplest thing on the drums so I'm not going to be able to do it. I was playing and bill was playing guitar and singing and it sounded nice, but I'll fuck up or something and he'll look back at me and I get nervous and I can't do it anymore. He get's mad..which is going to suck so bad when he tries to teach me and I can't do anything. Eeek...Oh well, I'll update...tell you how that goes.  I have to get in the shower though because I'm leaving at 9:30. Yayyy! I'll update tonight.

      God damnit I hate it when people tell me that I'm wrong when I know that I'm not. Like...Bill said "I dont know how to play Minesweeper" so I explained it to him..and when I did he was like "you're wrong" I've been playing that game for a long ass time, because my Uncle is the shit at it and he taught me when I was little. I want to ram a fucking spoon into the back of his throat...that had no purpose..:-P that wouldn't really do anything...but hey, atleast I didnt say that I wanted to stab him. I love Bill...I just hate when he tell's me I'm wrong when I'm not. AHHH! Anyway...I kind of had fun today I guess. They day was pretty much boring though, because Bill and I spent barely any time together at all. Now...this is what Bill got on and said to me.  NegativeWilliam: I can't do this shit.. Auto response from NegativeLaura: waiting for Ashley to get on...:-) NegativeWilliam: ..can't do it..NegativeLaura: You can't do whatNegativeWilliam: Bye.NegativeLaura: DO WHAT? NegativeWilliam: Just can't be with you..NegativeWilliam: ..just can't..  It's like..what the fuck, I didnt do anything..I was just explaining how to play a game and then he tells me I'm wrong even though he didnt know how to play it from the beginning:(....I also hate how he gets mad because I hate the phone. It's not so much that I hate the phone all together, but that I hate the phone at night..and he likes to talk at night. Yeah, sometimes I swallow my anger and talk to him, but it's just like...It's sooo frustrating because we never get off until really late at night, and then he gets mad when I dont call him early in this morning. It's just like AHHH! I'm not complaining..it's just SOOOOO frustrating. But I still love him:)...  I had to let Charlie go, but I dont feel like getting into that. Actually, I dont feel like doing anything anymore. Sorry I haven't been updating a lot..I'll try to update more from now on.  Oh yeah..The Goonies! haha..GREAT movie! ::claps hands::

      Welp, Lastnight I didnt get the picture to work for some reason. :(....but after I went to bed, I woke up this morning when my daddy came in and gave me coffee. I saw this on my computer...   It's The Aniversity of Integrity,   Relentless thoughts of Diversing Dreams,   Feeling the violence of the Ecstasy,   Hearing the Stretching of my Mind,   The Vaguest Fragrance of A vacant bruise,   The Suffered Rotting in the Narrow Noose,   Need Verification Of the Sharpest Pin,   and Your the cause of all this pain I'm in    Let Me Die,    I Pray To God,    I'll Beg,I did my time,    I've done my time,   All hope is lost,    All wishes Failed,   Nailed to the cross,    My face is pail    Fade to Black As The Poison Sinks,   Believe any thought that the hero thinks,   The Angel's Just a Black burned crow Abandoned,   His Halo's as Holy As My heart,   Crumbled Ink And Paper Murdered,   Charred and Scortched Shamelessly,   The Merit Is Not hard to find,   In the beautil torment in her eyes    Let Me Die,    I Pray To God,    I'll Beg,I did my time,    I've done my time,   All hope is lost,    All wishes Failed,   Nailed to the cross,    My face is pail   Bill wrote that, and it occured to me how truly amazing he is at writing lyrics. I mean I've read a lot of good lyrics and poems by people, but his are incredible. They're insane, and the worst part is..is it takes him NO TIME to write it. Sometimes people have to find words to rhyme with it and shit, but everything just comes to him. It's insane...I've heard him freestyle(rapping), and it's soooo insane. I dont think that anyone admires his talent as much as I do. Like, yeah people are like "it's really good" and shit...but I dont think that ANYONE understands the MIND that you have to have to write shit like that. Nobody KNOWS the mind that he has, and the shit that he thinks in his brain to come up with these kinds of lyrics. He is the most intelligent person I know, and I guess I forgot that for a long time until I woke up this morning, and after I read it..I got butterflies in my stomach. But anyway, I'll stop rambling on.  Ashley, I want us to hang out today. I think that Bill, you, and I should all go to the mall and hang out, but...I dont think that will ever happen. I wish that we could all hang out like every day. I'm hoping that when you get on you wont be doing anything today and you'll want to do something with me, but somehow Im doubting it. Of coarse, because I'm always thinking the worst..but, maybe the worst is the truth??  Anyway...It scares me. My dad comes in and wakes me up to give me coffee, and I'm naked. Like...he has SOOO many times, and I've always been covered but what happens if I'm not one time. Wouldn't that be a little weird? I dont know..sometimes I think about wearing clothes to bed, but I get uncomfortable and it's hard to sleep. I guess I'm just weird and wont put on clothes just in case. but eh...he's my dad its not like if he did see anything he'd get a hard on over it. (atleast lets hope not)...but oh well. -My sister and I have been getting along really really good lately. Yes, the one that I've punched and kicked and been grounded many times for hitting. :'(..I never meant to hurt her..I can't control myself sometimes. Which scares me, because I swear that if I had a gun or a knife in my hand and someone made me mad, I dont think that I'd think twice about killing them until after the fact. *sigh*..I think both Bill and I should start to help eachother on that, because some day the two of us are going to end up killing eachother.  Speaking of killing eachother, Bill has been having many many many dreams about killing me. (which is why he wrote those lyrics at the top)...Like, in his dreams, he shoots me...cuts my head off..stabs me...slices me up....and so on and so forth. He says that his dreams are so real to him, that when he wakes up..having me by his side seems like the real DREAM. I didnt really understand untill he explained to me. He asked me if I had to see someone kill him, what it would do to my mind. I said, I'd probably go insane afterwards. And like, he explained that Dream or not..he SEES me die. He FEELS my hair, and my blood when I am dead. He says that in his dream when he is holding my lifeless body in his arms it seems like its real. I guess that would kind of suck, especially if he's the one killing me. Oh yeah, and it's accidental by the way. I've been trying to interpret(?) his dreams..but I can't seem to figure them out.  When I was in 5th grade, Amber Pangburn and I went camping together. The two of us got bored so we decided to walk to the 'other' part of the camp. Like, where we knew nobody, and we'd never been there before. We were walking and we saw an open field surrounded by trees. Right in the middle there was a swing set with only two swings. Which was weird, because all the rest had like 6. We dedided that we'd swing on them for a while, until we were ready to go back. We were there for a while, and then these two boys rode up on their bikes and they were harrassing us. Asking us where we lived, How old we were...if we had any brothers or sisters and so on and so forth. Me, being the dumbass that I am started talking to them. Amber wouldnt talk, so I was like "come on amber, talk"...but she wouldnt. I answered Ambers questions for her, because by that time I knew everything her being like a sister to me and all. (I know this is boring, but there's more to it) So anyway....I told these two guys (they were like 17 or 18) that Amber and I had to head back to our camp. They told us that they werent letting us leave. I said "We have to go" and I was like begging them to let us get off, but they refused. Then they started being dumbasses and being like "what's the way out of here?" and we told them, but they went the other way..and we didnt dare move because they werent that far away, and they came back and started circliong the swing set. Amber and I were freaking out by this time. Me being the older one was like "amber its okay, calm down" It being a campground and all, you would think that there were people around..but everyone was gone. So finally they left, thinking that they'd go the opposite way we did because they had a better chance of catching up to us since we were walking and they were riding bikes. They were almost to us when we had no choice but to run into the woods..Somehow Amber and I split up. I was screaming "AMBER!! AMBER!! WHERE ARE YOU!" but I couldnt see her. I had NO idea where the fuck I was going, and I figured neither did she...but I kept running. By this time, I'm sure the boys had stopped, and were just trying to scare us..but I kept running anyway. Somewhere, I did find Amber, and we were both crying. I hugged her so tight, and we went back to our camp. So that's my big amazing story that had no point..  Anyway...so after that I had a dream, and I never put it together until about a couple of days ago. I've had this dream before...and I never knew what the location was until then. Well, not the whole thing, just the swing set. I dont remember what was around us..but I remember that there were these two guys, and they were running around killing all of my friends. (this was the year that I split from all of my friends)..I didn't really care about any of them. But Amber and I were sitting on a swing set (yes...a swing set, which I never put together until a couple of days ago)...Amber and I were sitting on a swing set, and everyone was dead. Amber was scared as hell..and I was trying to comfort her and tell her that everything was going to be okay. All of a sudden...one of the guys (the other one dissappeared)...but, one of the guys came up and stabbed amber in the back while she was on the swing. Not only did he do that, but he slit her throat. I remember seeing Ambers body fall forward onto the stone. I looked up at the person who did it..thinking that I had nothing to lose and that I was going to beat the shit out of the mother fucker. I remember reaching down and picking up a big rock, and I was about to throw it when I looked at the guys face and it wasn't a guy at all...It was me. I guess I figured that it was just a dream but after that is when I lost all of my friends. I was leaving them for guys and so on and so forthe. Maybe that was a sign or something...who knows, but..I know what Bill means now, because I saw Amber die...and when I woke up I cried. I cried for so long. I forgot about it though...and I'm pretty sure that a couple of days later Amber and I got in a huge fight, and she started becomming best friends with Marrah. That's when I lost her for good...and for the next few years, I had to fight for her to have me over instead of Marrah. Even then, Marrah came along.  I used to love Amber. I would have done anything for her...she was like an angel to me. I hate that word, but...I never wanted to lose her. No matter what happened, Amber was always there to help me get back up and start again. I still love her so much, I mean..I'll never ever stop loving her. I would have married that girl if I could have..just so that I knew she'd never leave me. Although, I decided to let her go, and get on with life. She still has growing up to do, and she doesnt know who she is..and that hurts me. I figure that if she misses me, she'll come back to me. (which we all know wont happen) I hope that she knows that I'd still do anything for her. I'd kill for her.  Anyhow..I'm rambling...and I hope that nobody actually stays to read this..because that was all just pretty much to myself. To remind myself that I do really care...I'm not just a heartless bitch. I'm so tired...but like........I can't sleep. Grr....Ashley, when you wake up IM me..and tell me what you're doing today. Maybe we can hang out or something..IF you want to.  I have to go call Bill and tell him not to ignore his dreams.  Bye bye
