      After 6 weeks of waking up in the middle of the night, it's finally over. Today was my last day of summer school. I am officially going to be LAZY and UNPRODUCTIVE for the rest of the summer. I'm leaving for Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts on tuesday. Anyway...I'm really tired tonight because thats just the way fridays are. So peace out.

      Yeah I didn't get blamed for anything of the things mentioned in my previous post. It turns out that the "marine" was actually in the army reserve and was like a volunteer cop for the roswell police department. (We were in Fulton County so he was out of jurisdiction. The person who got in the most trouble was the fake cop/fake soldier. He got screamed at by parents and by the principal of the school and had to leave there feeling like an idiot. The other kids whom he blamed got off with a light warning. So nothing serious came of this incident except GI Joe feeling like a GI Dipshit.

      OK, jesus christ what a funny/scary situation/story. Ok so you know that i'm in summer school and I have to wake up at 5:30 to drive to my school to catch a bus to Centennial High School, and ride the same bus back to my school and then go home. Anyway...we had developed a habit in the afternoon of throwing pencils/pens/other random objects at passing cars (to pass the time) So this afternoon we do the same thing as usual except we got a few BIG hits. There was some traffic so we really took advantage of it, nailing anything that moved. Out bus driver has never noticed because he is older and kindof oblivious. So today in the home stretch to our school, we notice that theres been the same dark-grey Ford Taurus tailing us for about 3 minutes. We started to get a little nervous as we approached the entrance to our school. As we pulled in, so did the Taurus. Thats when everyone was realling thinking..."Oh shit..i'm screwed.." So we stop and the car stops and guess who jumps out of the car like a bat out of hell....none other than a United States Marine. Throws open the car door, car still running, sprints over to the bus and right as the bus driver opens the door the psychotic marine (in his uniform) jumps on the bus and SCREAMS: "STAND FAST, STAND FAST". And everyone is like what the hell is this guy saying. He points to two kids right next to me and says RED SHIRT, BLUE SHIRT, STAND FAST NOW! And he turns to the bus driver and continues SCREAMING saying "YOUR OCCUPANTS HAVE BEEN THROWING OBJECT AT CARS FOR THE PAST 10 MILES!!!!" At that point and time, GI Joe literally drags to kids off the bus who hardly did anything and demands to speak with the principal of the school. That was funny because theres no faculty at our school during the summer. (Good one private) Somehow by the graces of God almighty I managed to slip by without him recognizing me as one of the people who threw things. Right about the time United State's finest was screaming SHUT UP, MAGGOT to two high school kids (the accused) their mothers came over and started ragging on the marine for yelling and screaming and thats when one of the most heated arguments i've ever seen erupted. So I kindof innocently slinked up the hill SLOWLY until I got all the way up to the entrance gates of the school and I HAULED ASS all the way home. I feel sorry for those kids who got blamed for it cuz like..that has to suck. I still don't know if I'm gonna get ratted on. I guess i'll find out tomorrow. ANYWAY, WHEW....breather....I get my braces off in like 2 hours. WONDERFUL! Anyway...hope you like that story...Peace out, and pray for me that I don't get screwed over.

      10 Things I hate...(no offense to anyone)  1) I hate waking up at 5:30 A.M. every day to go to summer school to sit in a classroom for five hours of math every day.  2) I hate people that go to summer school by choise.  3) I hate reality TV shows.  4) I hate how it always works out that the slow drivers end up in front of you and the speed demons are always behind riding on your bumper.  5) I hate how every time I go to Kroger I get into an argument with the employee in the checkout line.  6) I hate people that dye their hair colors of the rainbow.  7) I hate being bored.  8) I hate John Kerry.  9) I hate the Red Sox and the Yankees.  10) I hate Ford.  Have a nice day. =)

      Yeah, 4th of July break is over and I had to wake up at 5:30AM again this morning to go back to summer school. Let me clarify one thing: I may be lazy, but the reason I failed math is because I chose to have fun instead of workin my ass off. But I can't do that anymore cuz I need to get enough credits and such. Anyway, last night I watched Super Troopers (the 2nd best movie in the world next to Office Space). It gets funnier and funnier every time. I seriously reccomend watching it. Ok...peace.

      Wow. Friday turned out VERY different then I had planned. My motorized scooter ACTUALLY did come yesterday for some odd reason. AND, I went to the braves game which KICKED ASS. There was complete lack of rain. Nick Green hit a walk off homerun in the 11th inning to win the game. Then since it is 4th of July weekend they had a fireworks show which was awesome. So it turned out that the rain and the online catalog's didn't get in the way of a good friday. OH and today I could possibly be looking at cats because I'm going to get a cat and name him OZZY. Yeah, Ozzy. Thats right. Just like Ozzy Osbourne.

      Sup. Today I'm supposedly going to the braves game at 7:35PM but considering that it has rained for the past like 2 weeks straight I'm not so sure. If this game gets rained out I will honestly flip out something fierce. My motorized scooter that I ordered online was suppose to arrive yesterday but the fudgepackers accidently shipped it UPS Ground. Therefor, I have to wait another damn week. ARGH!! Some people in this world REALLY suck, don't they?

      Yeaah this is numero uno. The biigggggg first post. Wow, this is such an emotional moment. Excuse me while I go grab a tissue. Yeah, anyway one day I started randomly writing down how I felt on a sheet of paper every once in a while and I would look back on it later and laugh at what I wrote. So I decided to make one of these here thingy's so instead of writing it I could be lazy and type it. So I hope you like the rambling crap that I put on here. Enjoy.
