      I'm home guys! Hahaha.. Was over at my cuz's place while my parents were away.  Its nice to be home although I will miss  urlLink J . :) Went to NTUC with my family to shop for groceries. My brother was funny and stupid at the same time and he did something embarassing that this woman kept staring at him. He picked up this long thing, which looks like spring onion to me and place it slightly below his tummy and I was laughing at him. A woman walked pass and kept looking at him.   Bro: Look, fishing rod. *obviously the woman thought it was something disgusting*   Me: *laughing* You're dead, now that woman thinks lowly of you.   Bro: I think lowly of her too, who call her keep staring at me? Its a fishing rod what.   Me: What, did you say think lowly?  Bro: I wanna correct it, I think so "HIGHLY" of her till her head can hit the stars.   Me: Lame.   Was a stupid thing la. That woman kept staring at him and I kept disturbing him.   Am going off now. Ciao.

      Watched  HARRY POTTER 3 TIMES. Anyone wanna compete? Haha.. I didn't pay for all 3 though. Everytime i watch it gives me a new feeling to the story, never get sick of it. Especially Professor Lupin! Ahhhh.. I just love him!  Well.. Study about 2 - 3 hrs a day for the whole wk. Good eh? But its not good enough. Have this nagger next to me every second every minute to ask me to study. But its good. At least there's someone who makes sure I do.  Parents away in Malacca currently. They were at Ipoh a few days ago. When they come back I'm gonna cut my hair, get my plastic bright red specs that they don't know about. I feel so happy.  Got to go soon. Studying again before the nagger returns. Bye.  JJ 林俊傑 - 精靈   月光下的你沈默而孤單  挺直的脊樑和瘦削的肩膀  眼裏的迷惘  影子的蒼涼  夜霧　茫茫  可以對著你一整個晚上  什麼都不說數著呼吸幻想  想著真實的你　到底怎樣  怎麼堅強  但愛　輕悄悄的　追來的不露痕跡  化成一件外衣  披上眼前的你　我思念到了底  就一直逗留在你心裏   因為我遇見你像一場虛擬的遊戲  我認識你也只是網路上一段訊息  你若不在　我的腦海  就一片空白  因為我不停猜想你的心思你的臉  類比著和你見面走在一起的畫面  我會等待　你能接受  這麼愛

      Finally. The last day of the june vacation lessons. Had an O level talk by the cambridge examiners at the Singapore Power Building today. Was quite okay, we actually intended to run away but did not. Cause we're good girls. Haha.. Sharan and Clare took photos of Nat when she was sleeping and sent em' to me. *bursts out laughing* It looks really funny + Clare was laughing not stop like a crazy idiot.  Walked around Cineleisure for a while after that with Su Tian, Rach', Stella, Gena & Jian Wei. Quite boring... the whole of orchard has been walked repeatedly over and over again by us! Urr Hmmm.. The   DODO BIRD   here thought she lost her keys due to the big pocket she has and waited outside her house for an hour for her parents to return and when she step in and search her bag,  SHE FOUND HER KEYS . WTH?! But I did check my bag before that but couldn't find a single thing. Bloody..   Bye bye.. Going to watch Eternal Sunshine Of A Spotless Mind. Hope I can get pass that bloody box-office lady and also the guard at the theatre. Wish Me Luck. :)

      Saturday and Sunday morning was spent eating. Went to Chinatown with my parents to eat laksa and those traditional kaya with bread. Consecutively 2 days. Heehee.. You might think i'm sick but their laksa is dang good. Umm Hmmmm...   Shop with my parents at NTUC, grab lots of stuff off the shelf. Sheesh.. all food, HAHA!   Went to my cuzzy's house this afternoon, was fun, waddle in the pool with them [all small kids.] played with bubbles in the garden, was tiring but quite fun. Drank diluted tea with loads of carnation milk added by the goondusamy here. :) Had steamboat for dinner today although i didn't eat much. Wasn't hungry due to the egg tart in the afternoon and the delicious lunch my cousin made. Wheee.. And now, I'm stuck on the computer chatting away, checking mails and all.   GOTTA STUDY.  I don't see the motivation. Aarghhh.. I've better buck up alright.   Going off. Bye!

      F.I.R - 妳的微笑.  喜歡用我的音調 唱出你的味道 這一秒 有種感覺甜蜜的發酵  一百種言語知道 愛有一個聲道 才明瞭   是你眼神傳來的暗號 太多的幸福報到 拼湊愛的美妙  笑一笑投入你懷裡然後撒嬌 不需要別人來教   把愛緊緊抓牢 這一秒 決定擁抱你給的美好  愛情是你獨特的味道 在我的心中圍繞 別人都不了   只有你知道 因為你 世界不再單調 我的微笑  你明白就很好 你就像月亮繞著軌道 擁抱著地球閃耀   在我的星球 寫下驚嘆號 有了你世界神魂顛倒  你的微笑 編織了每一個奇妙   I like this song.   Oh wells.. School was boring. 1 hr of History and then 4-5 periods of art.  I practically rot in art, but i did draw some crap on my paper, which looks pretty good to me. Haha! Bought 8 days. DANIEL RADCLIFFE IS SO CUTE. :)  I'm gonna watch Prisoner of Azkaban again. I don't care! And I'm gonna get the VCD too.  As you can see some give me hugs thing below. You can go click and click if you are bored and give me as many hugs as you want. :) I'll feel loved. Haha.. Please tell me who gave me the hugs. Went to bugis after school. Took Neoprints with Rachel, Su Tian and Stella. Turned out quite fine. Jian Wei had very bad fever he went back after joining us for a while. Hope he gets well soon.   Signing off here. :p       This picture is what my friends claim as a sissy. While I think otherwise.

      Hello. I'm blogging. As you can see from my pathetic template, i don't bother to do this blog up as i don't see a need to as it would go down most probably after the holidays.  Watched Harry Potter today. And I ain't satisfied with it. They compress so much into 2 hrs 15 mins taking off a lot of parts in the book.  The elaboration on Hogsmeade is missing, and Harry's birthday. The firebolt. The lesson with Professor Mcgonagall on divination on "Animagus"?? ALL GONE.  Man, I was dying to see all these parts. But the cast were all very very good looking. Hermione looked the best! Very very pretty. I admire her curly long hair. Haha..  Well, would be signing off here. :)

          HAPPY BIRTHDAY NAMIRAH!! :)      As you people can see, i haven't blogged for a long long time. Had Adam Khoo for the first 3 days of this week. IT WAS GREAT! Now the whole class is so motivated. Oh well.. I shan't blabber much about it as its a long long story. Ask me if you want to.  Friday, good news came!  WE WON        張善為 &amp; 潘瑋柏's concert tickets.    5 pairs in total.  1 pair for me.  1 pair for Stella.  1 pair gaven by the drink vendor auntie as she ain't going.  2 pairs for Su Tian. She won both the starhub and the i sport competiton.    I think we're so super lucky, when we want we dont get, when we didn't even put a little hope it in, the tickets come flushing in! I think God's trying to put a stop to what we're doing. After the concert, please stop all nonsense. Hahaha..   Adios!

      No words can explain how happy I am now. :) Su Tian will know what it is, but then, the fear is there too. Hai.. I suppose there's pros and cons to the situation.  Counting down 3 days before good/bad news befalls. I hope its SUPER GOOD news.   The wedding was great. Four Seasons Hotel, really good service!  Saturday night's play was superb. The story and all. Kept me attentive.   Will that person ever come back?  The one who taught me how to spin my pencil. The one who watched a ghost movie with me when we intended on Lilo & Stitch. The one who kept talking to me when I was in class.  The one who knows who "mushroom ng" is.  The one who is 'gay'.  The one who wrote a 7 page essay on some funny warcraft story. The one who drew on the back of my foolscape a messy classroom with hamsters and all.   That day. I wish, will come back to me.  It was a silly mistake only a dumb fool like me would have made.   張善為 - 這麼多 那麼多  還記得那天下午 妳說妳沒有感覺了  妳說妳不想再哭了   妳還說 妳不怕孤單不怕面對寂寞  那所有快樂不再屬於妳和我   曾經我是愛你這麼多 曾經你也愛我那麼多  一滴滴眼淚一段段的回憶 害怕如此寂寞   想大聲說不要離開我 讓我繼續愛妳那麼多  一個個承諾全都變成失落 明天醒來 希望是一場夢   夢會醒天會亮 揮別了昨日的溫柔  我擁有了自由 卻不懂得該忘了走  默默去 承受 接受這一刻   Ciao.

      Hello people.. :)   I bought a pair of red sketchers shoe. so happy. haha.. but then, its leather. Furthermore, its premium natural leather. I wonder how many cows i've killed by drinking their milk, using their skin. Those pictures i see from  urlLink Peta.org  on the cows scares me, so i change to drinking soya milk. But i do still eat milk products. They say milk is pus and bacteria from the cow's thing.  YUCK.  Bought a top from OP also. :)   Its very late and my dad is nagging. Bye!

       I'm finally posting. Tried yesterday but i couldn't log in, apparently blogger screwed up. Password invalid.       8/7's concert was  great,  i enjoyed myself. Suffering from very bad cough now. Though enjoyed myself, there were a few things i was very mispleased with.       They shall not be named. [A,B & C shall be the representative.]      Some fucktards at the concert who practically didn't deserve to go. Can't blame B&C for not going as it wasn't our ticket but A. aaaaarghhh.. the thought of it makes me wanna slap  it  right in the face. If you are actually going there only for the  10  idiotic minutes might as well stay at home and spend your time studying. Don't go there and show the whole world your stupid face and sit there acting like a retard. And claim after the whole concert you're thinking of them. As if you enjoyed a single bit or only for that  pathetic 10 minutes.         I COULD HAVE SOLD THAT TICKET FOR A DECENT PRICE.          You didn't deserve to go.       I don't care if you read this, but if you do, you jolly well do some self-searching. You ought to.
