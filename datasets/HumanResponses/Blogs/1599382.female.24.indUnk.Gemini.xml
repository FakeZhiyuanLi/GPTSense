      Last night was better than Wednesday.  Stephen and I went swimming and then to Dairy Queen for ice cream.  He's a sweety, I'm gonna keep this one!  In the shallow end of the pool I kept trying to knock him over, but I'm too small so he just laughed at me and threw me in repeatedly.  His friends arrive this afternoon, I'm not sure what we're going to do, but the boy was asking what clubs are good on Friday night.    My project is going a lot better at work now that I have a clear picture of where everything is going.  However, I have the daunting task of fixing all the dead links in the collections that will be incorporated into my project.  I keep asking if we can hire a trained ape to do this part, it really takes no intelligence, just patience or mindlessness.  Hmm well that's all for now.  *sitting at a desk pirating music, yo ho ho and a barrel of rum me mateys!*

      Well yesterday mostly sucked.  The car the guys were fixing was completely rusted out and ended up being sent to the scrap yard.  Then Rogers sent me a huge phone bill eventhough my first 2 months were supposed to be free except for the $35 activation fee!  Yay I get to spend several hours on the phone sorting that one out.  The boy and I had to sit around all night waiting for the tow truck guy to come and get the Accord so we didn't get to go to the park at all.  Oh well tonight after work we're supposed to be going swimming, that should be fun.  Two of his friends are coming out on Friday.  I already know Kirk, but I'll be meeting Colin for the first time.  Oy, more people to pinch me for monkey trees, Chevron stations, 60 km per hour and complete stops.  It all started when I taught them the Monkey tree game.  Whenever you see a monkey tree you are supposed to pinch the other person/people and say Monkey Tree can't pinch me!  Unfortunately the boys decided that they needed more pinching opportunities so the decided on the above 3 reasons to pinch me!    Hmm it's 10:10am and I was supposed to have a meeting with my boss starting at 10am and he's still nowhere to be found.  I haven't seen him since Wednesday, hopefully everything is ok.  *sitting at my desk and admiring my new cell phone*

      Yay Stephen and I have been together for 4 months now!  We're gonna have dinner together and go for a walk in the park tonight, should be fun.    I'm very frustrated with my work outs.  My weight got way higher than usual this year and no matter what I do none of it seems to want to budge.  I spend a minimum of an hour a day doing cardio and I weight train every few days as well.  Argh!  The only thing that seems to be happening is that my thighs are getting bigger, definately not what I want.  Grrr, I know most people will think I'm being silly, I'm not fat, but I'm not in the shape I want to be in.  Perhaps some of the weight is muscle now, but I wanna fit into my khakis!!!! Oh and whoever decided we need to drink 8 or more cups of water per day can kiss my butt, all that keeps happening is that I constantly have to use the washroom!  Grrr and several well chosen swear words!  Today is car fixing day, my dad and Stephen will be starting in under 30 mins, I just hope it goes smoothly.  As if though, nothing is ever straight forward with cars :P.  Stephen's friends are flying out here on Friday, so two more days until I find out if all Ontario guys are crazy.  On Saturday I will probably be going hiking and kayaking with Kimi and Wendy.  It should be fine, hopefully it won't be like some of my paddling adventures where I start to drift out to sea.   Then on Sunday I should be going out for coffee with Heidi and Kathryn.    Right now though, I should be getting back to work.    *Sitting in an air conditioned office listening to Def Leppard*

      I'm a bit sore today, I went to Boot Camp class at the gym last night, it's a good workout, but ouch!  Tonight I'm going to Spin class, I've done those quite a few times and I like them a lot.  If I'm still bored I might go to water running later on, but maybe I'll get together with friends or something.    Any exciting news...hmmm, Stephen and I have been together 4 months as of tomorrow!!! He's such a sweetie I can't wait to see him tomorrow night!  Other than that, my sorority sister Kim left for RCMP training, yay Kim!    Perhaps my life is getting dull, ah well it's better than last summer when I was working 7 days a week!  I'm gonna spend my weekend getting some sun and doing a few local hikes.  Ah summer....zzzz....

      Hmm, well I had a pretty good weekend.  On Friday I went swimming with the boy.  Saturday, I slept in, went shopping with my parents, and had dinner with Heidi.  We went to Milestones and then meandered along the seawall for a bit.  On Sunday I went hiking around Buntzen Lake, it was really pretty, but when we crossed the floating bridge I thought I was gonna fall into the lake for sure!  I saw Stephen later Sunday evening and we had a quiet dinner together, fun but it'll be nice when he has weekends off again.    The fixing of my car didn't happen on Thursday, it was raining so the guys left it until Wednesday of this week.  Hopefully if all goes well I'll have a car by the end of this week.    No really exciting plans for this week.  Stephen's friends might be flying out to visit him on Thursday but he doesn't know for sure yet.  It should be interesting to meet them, so far all I've heard are a lot of stories and Stephen has shown me some photos.  Hmm hope they're not all crazy :P.

      Ah my first entry.  Tonight I'm going to have dinner with Stephen, my very cute boyfriend, and his landlord.  Tomorrow, however, will be much more exciting!  My dad and Stephen are fixing up a car for me!  Finally at 23 I'll have a car and not have to borrow mum's.    Stephen and I have been together for almost 4 months now!  He's really sweet and good looking too!  We met through some mutual accquaintances at a pub night and for our first date I took him canoeing.  Later tonight we are going clubbing with some of my sorority sisters, it should be fun, I haven't seen many of them since April.    This summer I'm working a desk job instead of going back up to camp as an intern.  I get paid more, but I'm really gonna miss having my own pool, canoes, and 560 acres to wander about.  Hopefully next summer I'll get back up to camp, but tuition is massive this year, so I have to put $ in front of fun.

      I went and saw Legally Blonde 2, it was terrible, the first one was funny at least, this one was just painful.  After the movie, Stephen and I went to the beach and wandered about for a bit.  It was a pretty good night, but the boy is obsessed with his computer, it is kind of annoying when he plays with it while I'm over, but I guess no one is perfect.  Today is pretty dull; my boss is away again so here I am in a bright pink Hawaiian sundress.  Only 5 days until I leave for Toronto!  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll have a good time.    Tonight is the first night of the fireworks, I'm biking to the beach with Kimi and Stu, it should be fun as long as I can figure out what route to take to their house once I get off the bridge.  At least this way I will find out approximately how long it would take me to bike to work.    *listening to American Pie by Don McLean*

      Monday again, argh!  I had an okay weekend.  Friday night I just vegged, Saturday I went shopping with Allea, meandered over to Caribbean Days and then met up with Heidi and Adrian and we went to White Pine Beach.  The beach was loads of fun, the lake was just the right temperature and really clean.  Heidi and I both freaked out when we ended up standing on a slimy log!  After the lake, I stayed for dinner at their place and we watched Shanghai Knights, the movie was okay, but not one I'd watch a second time.  On Sunday, a bunch of us went to the waterslides again, but Stephen had fallen on his arm and bruised the bone so he couldn't go on too many slides.  Later we ate dinner at my parents' place and watched bad British shows.    Today I'm at work, yeehaw yay oh boy... I'm going to try to leave early so that I can straighten out my schedule for school next term.  I have three million things to do before I leave for Ontario next week!  I have to book my physical, deal with my cell phone problems, have my bikini fixed (a story in itself), complete as much of my work project as possible, pay 1st term tuition, get my student id, and pack.    About my bikini, the clip at the back broke as I leaned over to straighten my towel and a couple of teenage boys got a free show.  Yikes!  Well that's enough for today, off I go!  *waiting for the hands on the clock to hit that magical off work time*

      Well my weekend didn't work out exactly as planned.  Stephen and I did go to the waterslides on Saturday but we got in another argument because of his overbearing landlord.  It would be a lot easier to stomach if this were a relative we were talking about, but it's not.  I don't like the fact that we have been arguing more lately, but there is something distinctly agitating about being constantly pressured by his landlord to spend time with people we don't know.  This isn't Stephen's take on the situation, but I'm not crazy.  Here is the deal, his landlord has a girlfriend (they are both in their 60s or so) and her niece has brain cancer.  I feel badly for the girl, she's really sweet and all, but Stephen's landlord keeps inviting him to things when this girl is over.  She's only 13 so it's not a jealousy thing, but it is always last minute and it always ruins our plans and causes arguments.  His landlord keeps coming down or coming up to us in the driveway and stating that this girl is coming over and we should come too.  He always asks Stephen, who usually forgets our plans which makes me look like the bitch because I'm always saying no we can't we are doing x, y, or z instead.    My personal opinion, which Stephen doesn't agree with, is that this girl really has no interest in meeting us or spending time with us (what 13 year old would want to spend time with strangers?) and that it is all his landlord just wanting to force us or rather mostly Stephen (I feel mostly like an unwanted accessory) to come over.  I don't hate his landlord; I just get this off sort of feeling from him.  He's harmless, mostly he's a misguided Good Samaritan, but I hate the way the whole situation makes me look bad and gets my back up.  All I wanted this weekend was to spend time with my boyfriend, and it all got shot to hell.  We didn't end up going to the lake on Sunday, we fought several times and I ended up feeling horrible.  I don't think I'm selfish for not wanting to be pressured into what I feel is bothering this girl.  I think the landlord is quilting Stephen into doing things, but the boy doesn't agree.  I suppose I should ignore the whole situation when it isn't affecting me directly, but every time I go over there I have to worry that our plans will be shelved again.  Now that I have that off my chest, on to the good parts of the weekend.  When we got to the waterslides there was new ride, a lazy river, not terribly exciting, but I'd never been in one before and it was relaxing.  Stephen and I went down the  urlLink Valley of Fear  in a double tube and we hit the top on each side at least twice!  Eek, I screamed a lot, but I might consider going on it again.    Sunday evening we went to the beach near Stephen's place and played Frisbee, I still suck, but my throwing did improve a bit.  Monday evening we rented  urlLink Rules of Engagement   it was pretty good for a war movie, but still not one of my top ten movies.  Tuesday I went to see Finding Nemo with a bunch of people from Outdoor School.   I'd seen it already, but it was fun to do something with a bunch of alumni I hadn't seen in a while.  After the movie, we trekked to Tim Horton's and then I eventually made my way to bed around 1am.  After all this complaining about Stephen's landlord I should mention the fact that I am otherwise very happy with my relationship with Stephen.  He's really sweet, and cute too.  We will have been dating 5 months as of this Friday and I couldn't have met a better guy than him.  The majority of the time we get along really well and have a lot of fun together.  He tells me how important I am to him and how much he cares about me, which means a lot to me.  We even talk about eventually getting married and having kids, and for once, I'm not all that scared about the prospect of settling down with someone.  I'm back in school for another two years, so nothing is immediate or anything, but I don't feel I'm missing anything by not dating other guys.  I'm happy with Stephen and if he does eventually decide to keep me around permanently, I wouldn't have to think twice about it.  *sitting at a cluttered desk wishing I was outside*

      I hate bylaw officers!  I got a $40 parking ticket yesterday, grrrrrr.  My fault, but still NO FAIR!!!  The concert at Michelle's was pretty cool, we all hung out and talked until around 6pm when the  urlLink band  showed up.  There was a live radio show and the djs interviewed all the band members and we heard a few live songs.  It was good to see some of the  urlLink Alpha Phis  again.  Later on I met up with Kimi, but she wasn't feeling too well so we just hung around her place instead of bike riding.  On Saturday we're going to the mall to pick out a whole new wardrobe for her.  It should be fun, I just hope I can avoid buying too many things for myself.  After shopping I'm meeting up with the boy to go to the waterslides in the valley.  Hopefully on Sunday we'll get to go to the lake near his place and maybe even take his  urlLink motorcycle  (read: crotch rocket), I keep wanting to go back up there after hiking the trail a few weeks back.  I've definately got to hit the gym tonight I have been slacking for the last few days due partly to a running injury.  Stupid old runner made me get a huge blister under my big toe nail!  Ugh, at least I have bright new silver runners to try out tonight!  *chair dancing to Secret Agent Man*

      Well I truly am blonde, mentally anyways.  The dinner and dessert thing for Laura is next Wednesday not last night.  Oh well.  I went out with Stephen and met his co-workers last night.  They were pretty nice, they mostly chatted about work, but it was kinda to be expected.    Today I'm going over to Michelle's for a radio concert.  She won a house party with Theory of a Dead Man, I only know one of their songs, but it should be fun.  Later on Kimi and I are going to bike ride around my neihbourhood.    Not much is happening today, it's the fourth day that I've been the only one in the office.  Tomorrow Paul will be in, but for now this place is pretty dull.  *wondering if silver running shoes were really the best choice*

      Wow it has been awhile since I updated this!  What happened lets see...   Thursday I met up with Ann and Grace, we went to Earl's for dinner and then Death by Chocolate for dessert.  It was good to see Ann again, she said she didn't get out much in Taiwan, I bet that's gonna change a lot now that she's back in town.  Friday night the boy and I went to a pub with some friends and chatted for a bit, I had a daquiri and we headed home, both Stephen and I were pretty tired from working all week.  On Saturday Stephen and I were supposed to go to the waterslides, but it was rainy so we didn't bother.  Instead we went out for Chinese food with my relatives from the prairies and then had dessert with Stephen's landlord and his landlord's girlfriend and her neices.    Sunday after much shopping and running about we met up with Wendy.  Plans for a beach adventure were lost due to more rain!  We ended up going shopping and then over to Stephen's for dinner and a movie.  We watched  Angela's Ashes , it may have been an award winning book, but it didn't make for a very good movie.    Monday was work, I went to boot camp class after and got my butt kicked!  It is a great work out, but yikes you need a shower after that class!  Tuesday was Paul's birthday and I finally found him a gift.  I got him a wind-up dinosaur that sparks out the mouth.  Sounds odd, but when Paul was a kid he had these pants with brightly coloured dinosaurs all over them and he's always joking about them.  I found a card in the shape of a wind-up dino first and later came across the real thing at this bizarre shop on 4th Ave and I just had to buy it!    For Paul's birthday I went out for all you can eat fish and chips with him and his family.  We went back to his parents' place for cake and then headed to Paul's to play Mario Party 4.  At around midnight Tristan (Paul's younger brother) and I both figured the game needed to end whether we completed it or not and we headed off.  Today I am once again having Chinese food with my relatives, but after that I'm meeting up with my sorority sisters for dessert at Ada's.  Laura, my grand big sister in Alpha Phi is back from Ottawa for a couple weeks so we're all getting together tonight.  Oh and here is a hilarious  urlLink link  my friend John had as his msn sign in a few days ago It's a bit wierd but it's funny if you watch it all the way through.  *sitting in the office trying to find an excuse to venture outside*

      Well T3 wasn't too bad, but it wasn't too good either.  Yay Ann is back from Taiwan!  Woo hoo, I didn't figure she'd be gone long, but she's back sooner than I expected.  We are going to do dinner tomorrow night with Grace.  Yay!    Not much is happening on the Cryssie front.  I kinda miss the frat now that I've been home for a couple of months.  It was nice to have my own place where I could come and go from whenever I pleased.  I miss the karaoke nights with Laurence, the stupidity of the Ray G. situation, Brett's dumb comments, but I am greatly relieved to no longer share a roof with Kristaps.  Psi U was a great place, albeit a bit run down.  Being one of five girls living in a guys' frat house is an experience that I highly reccommend to any girl who can tolerate the mess and odd happenings.  I think my favourite Psi U memories are kitchen parties, painting Laurences toenails, playing pool in the basement, wathcing Simpsons every night at 5:30pm and songfest practices in the front room.    Top Five Reasons (in no particular order) to live at Psi U 1. Cheap rent 2. Good food 3. Having a place to crash on campus 4. 3am runs 5. Anything can happen  Well back to work, Kimi and I are biking today for exercise, should be fun!  *trying to stay awake after going to the late movie last night*

      Tuesday already!  I'm going to see Terminator 3 with Stephen tonight, I didn't see the first two, but he's really excited about this one so I'll be a good girlfriend and go.    Last weekend was lots of fun.  On Saturday it was Heidi's birthday so we all went to the water slides and then to her place for dinner.  Her boyfriend made her a cake, it was so cute it said "Happy Birthday Heidi" in strawberries!  Well actually it said "Happy Birday", apparently he got distracted while making it, but still how sweet!  On Sunday the boy and I went swimming again.  I don't think I will ever be able to knock him over!  Oh the trials of being small!  Monday night was pretty dull, I went to my boot camp class and got all gross and sweaty then I went home and watched too much t.v.  Ah well one has to vegetate some time I suppose.  *sitting at my computer trying to drink 2 litres of water a day*

      Ugh what a dull day.  I had all you can eat sushi with Paul at lunch today, yikes I'm full!  My project is taking shape at work, now to write out the intros for each section.  Tonight I'm going to teach the boy how to make mashed potatoes!  Fun fun.  Tomorrow is Heidi's birthday, I'm going to buy her present tonight.  Tomorrow we're all going to the waterslides and then to her place for dinner after.  I hope I don't have an allergic reaction to the chlorine this time.  Other than than not much is happening, I'm going rollerblading with Stephen after dinner and shopping tonight!  *sitting at my desk wondering how to get my brain to thaw*

      I have suddenly developed a taste for sushi.  I used to gag everytime I tasted seaweed, but I seem to be over that now.  Mmm sushi...    Today has been fairly dull, just work and more work.  I'm going swimming with Stephen tonight, that should be fun.  I bought chocolate fondu and strawberries for dessert tonight, I hope he likes them!    Last night Kimi and I had our first weekly exercise session of the summer.  It went pretty well, we tried out some exercises on my exercise ball and went for a walk.    Oh my, I still haven't got Heidi's present yet and her party is Saturday, I should get on that.  I have to buy office supplies for work this afternoon, so I'll pop by some other shops on the way there.  *leaving the office to buy kleenex...riveting I know*

      What happened since Friday....well I met Stephen's friend Colin, he seems nice.  We all went to Anton's for dinner on Friday, yay pasta.    On Saturday I met up with Kimi, Stu, and Wendy for kayaking and a short hike.  It was fun, I can see myself becoming a kayak guide.  After kayaking I went to Ikea with Kimi and Stu, we had a meatball dinner and then shopped.  I bought Stephen an ice cream scoop, maybe he'll have less bent spoons!  That night I slept at the boy's, he's nice and cuddly!    On Sunday I went to the waterslides with Paul, it was kinda cold but at least the lines were small.  After that we went to dinner with his parents for their anniversary.  It was the first time I had snitzel, it wasn't bad, but I don't think it'll become a staple in my diet anytime soon.    On Monday I worked from home and then went and got my backpacking tent, woo-hoo!  That night I cooked dinner for Stephen, I even found really good de-alcoholized wine.    Tuesday, being Canada day I was in the parade, it was fun, but I accidently bonked some kid in the head with a lollipop!  Later on I went to Danae's and we had a get together and acted like idiots in the wading pool, 23 and I still find wading pools amusing!    Today I'm at work as usual, nothing exciting.  I'm going to spin class tonight, but other than that I have no plans.  *sitting at a desk wishing my work would do itself*

      Well I am back from Toronto!  It was an interesting two weeks.  I did a heck of a lot of shopping, I now own 4 more pairs of shoes, 2 new skirts, a sweater, a tank top, a jacket, a t-shirt, and other things I've forgotten about already.  I only really saw downtown T.O. once, we drove around a bit and I saw the tower and part of Yonge St., I spent most of my time in Brampton.    The first weekend we went up to Sault Ste. Marie for a wedding, the drive was 8 hours, but we had fun and even stayed in a hotel with a 5 1/2 storey water slide!  They had recently re-filled the pool so the water was only 16 degrees celucius!  When I went down I could barely breathe the water was so cold and you had to lie down flat because the slide was so narrow!  Eek!  The second weekend we went to Niagara Falls, it was pretty and then we visited his grandfather.  On other days we went to movies with his friends, played glow-in-the-dark mini golf, went to the mall, worked out, and hung around with different groups of Stephen's friends and their girlfriends.  I'll write more later, but that's all for now.  *trying to adust to Pacific Standard Time*

      Back in school again.  Outdoor Rec is fun, but trying to find a balance between work, school and social time is getting difficult.  Last week we went on a 4-day voyageur canoe trip, it was great we swam in the ocean, stayed at a camp with cabins and showers and learnt lots about plants and animals in Indian Arm.    Stephen and I have been together for almost seven months now!  Yay, he's so sweet.  I'm going to see him tomorrow night; hopefully I'm not too neurotic about my studying to enjoy it.  I just have to keep telling myself I'm a smart person and I'm going to do well.  It is only navigation I just have to remember how to calculate a few things and use my compass properly and it will all be over soon.  Work is slow today, my boss isn't in and I can't do much on my project without his input.  Here's to catching up on other stuff around the office!  Well I should go mail stuff.  *over thinking school and trying not to panic at the same time*

      One day until Halloween and I still don't know what I'm going to dress up as!  Eek!  I can't really worry about it until this afternoon; I have a midterm today at 1pm so I've been studying for the past few weeks.    Stephen and I have been fighting a lot lately and we almost broke up on Tuesday night.  We've decided to try to work out our differences.  I've been taking out my stress about school on him, it’s not fair, but I'm working on it.  Outdoor Rec shouldn't be stressful one would think, however, we have a lot of silly little assignments that pile up and some profs aren't very professional.  I mostly like the course but my computer prof is about the most annoying guy I have ever had to deal with in terms of classes.  Argh.  This weekend I have a Halloween party with my class on Friday, on Saturday I'm getting my belly button pierced and maybe dyeing my hair auburn, and on Sunday I'm kayaking in the morning with Stephen and hanging out with my long time family friend Melissa in the afternoon.  So, as long as I do well on the midterm today, I will be having a stellar weekend!  *hoping that I've studied the right stuff for my exam*

      Wow it has been a long time since I posted anything!  Not much other than school is going on though.  I'm doing pretty well in my classes and my classmates are okay.  I'm taking kayaking and arts and crafts as my selective skills for Outdoor Rec.  Stephen and I have been together almost 8 months now!  I wish this post was more co-herent, but I have a head ache and I have been studying for two midterms for the past few hours.  I'm gonna see the boy tonight, yay!  Other than that not much is happening.   *studying, studying, studying*

      To update you, I went as a bunch of grapes for Halloween.  It was a cool costume, but not to easy to move around in.  I wore a green leotard and tights and safety pinned purple balloons onto my torso.  Yes, I am aware I'm strange.  I did pierce my bellybutton, but I didn't dye my hair.  My mum was choked about the piercing, but I'm 23 so come on!  My first term of Outdoor Rec is behind me and I got straight As, yay me!  Next term I just have to worry about accounting, as the rest of the classes should be fine.  Stephen and I will have been dating 10 months as of Christmas day!  Things are going well and tonight we're going to see a movie, I want to see  urlLink Mona Lisa Smile , but he'll probably want to see some guy movie.  I don't have any big holiday plans, just Christmas with my family and Stephen.  Hopefully I'll get a bit more snowboarding in before school starts again.  Other than that, I hope to get some sleep!   *sitting at work watching the rain*

      Hmm well lots has happened since my last post.  Stephen and I broke up after just over 11 months together, he's not a bad guy, but the breakup was for the best.  We were fighting a lot and he kept saying that maybe we weren't right for each other and that I was too insecure and needed counseling.  In the end, he broke up with me over the phone because he was jealous of my friendship with another guy and he had misplaced anger from a past relationship that ended badly.  Currently I am seeing a guy who lives near me, his name is Colin and he is really sweet.  We started off running together and quickly ended up spending most of our time together.  He is 26, has blond hair, blue eyes, and a really nice body.  Of course looks aren't everything, though his smile was the first thing I noticed about him when he sat down next to me and started talking to me the night we met.    When I first met him, I thought he was really hot, but I wasn't interested in anything other than friendship and a running partner.  He tells me he wanted to get to know me when he first saw me; it's sweet but a bit unnerving at the same time.  So far we have had lots of fun, we have gone running, snowboarding, clubbing, played darts, foosball, and pool, gone to parties, hung out with his friends, taken trips to Tofino and Squamish together, gone out for dinner, and basically spent tons of time together.  We've only been dating a short time but we've both said, "I love you."  Most people are skeptical that we'll work out but I'm being optimistic, I could get my heart broken, but if I don't at least try then I'll never really know.  Colin is very passionate, he loves me, surfing, his friends, his family, skateboarding, skiing and being active.  I worry about the boy sometimes, he strikes me as someone who jumps into things without fully weighing the consequences of his actions, but then again I'm often accused of being the same way.  He tells me that I'm his true love and he wants us to be together a long time, I can hear the emotion in his voice, I'm just concerned at times that he doesn't realize the high expectations I place on people.  I'm not the easiest person, I can get disappointed and while I give my friends a lot of patience I'm not known to take much crap from guys I date.  I hope the boy doesn't get hurt, I don't want to have another ex, but I do expect more integrity from my boyfriends than most girls.    In other news, Heidi and I spent the weekend in Portland!  We drove down Saturday and had tons of fun!  We went shopping, checked out some bars, had giant drinks at Red Lobster, and talked to tons of friendly Americans.  I bought some Victoria Secret body spays, vanilla mints, appletini mix, a gap ball cap, an Abercrombie shirt, crazy US junk food, and Jack in a Box antenna balls!  We stayed in Portland, shopped there and in Seattle, Burlington, and Bellingham.  It was really cool I had never been on any road trips with Heidi and I would definitely do it again, we talked about going to Cali this summer!  As for school, it drags on; I'm acing everything although sometimes I wonder how!  I go out constantly and am having so much fun in my social life I just hope I don't reach a point where my grades suddenly take a nosedive.  Ah well, it is Outdoor Rec and people don't generally fail!  *listening to Blink 182 - I miss you*

      Happy St. Patrick's Day!  It appears that my wardrobe contains nothing green, too bad...  I've had an interesting couple of weeks, mostly fun only a few annoying moments.   Two weeks ago I went to a surfing competition with Colin and his friends.  It was pretty good, we drove down to Washington and camped out for 3 nights.  My surfing is still terrible, and I still have bruises from that weekend, but I'm looking forward to getting better.  Last weekend Colin was sick so we stuck around town.  On Saturday we went bikini shopping and then to Ikea and on Sunday practiced skateboarding, played frisbee at the beach, and saw his friend Jeff's new place.  This week he is staying with me while my parents are away, Monday we went to a film festival and last night we just hung out at my place and played board games while listening to my parents' records.  Tonight we are supposed to go out drinking for St. Paddy's day, but we are still up in the air as to where we're going to go, and who to go with.    I met Colin's mum the other week.  She is very nice and I think we got along well.  She brought me presents, that kinda made me a bit nervous, but it was sweet of her.  From what I saw of it, her and Colin have a very good relationship and they definately love each other a lot.  Anyways I'm off to buy a wetsuit....

      I survived winter camping! It wasn't half as cold as I thought it would be, but I'm still more into summer camping.  My class went up to Marriot Basin for the weekend and built an igloo, snow caves and even summited a small peak!  I was a great weekend but I'm feeling a bit exhausted from all the activity.  Colin and I are doing well.  I saw him a couple of hours after I got back from my trip when he got back from surfing in the states.  We have a really good relationship, we see each other quite a bit but I don't get sick of him.  This week I get to meet his mother, she is coming out from Ontario for a week.  We are all going to have dinner together on Wednesday; I'm excited and nervous all at the same time.  Colin thinks that his mother is going to like me, I certainly hope so, but I'm still a bit jittery about the whole thing.  Colin and I have spent so many nights together it is driving my parents nuts.  My mum is concerned, but really, it isn't too much of her business.  I really enjoy spending time with Colin, but it will be much easier during the summer when I don't have to worry that it'll impact my grades.  So far, my grades are still straight As, but I have a gigantic midterm tomorrow that I am pretty nervous about.  I guess the main thing that I am nervous about is being in love.  I can find things about Colin to complain about, but I don't want to break up with him.  I love him and I know that no one is perfect.  He is the best guy for me and he is sure about me.  I guess I have trouble accepting the fact that things are fine and that as long as we both communicate and don't let other people get in the way that things will only get better.  I'm just going to do my best and concentrate on enjoying the time I spend with him and if we are meant to be we will end up together.  *sitting at work stressing about tomorrow's midterm*

      I'm getting pretty bad about blogging, it has been over a month since my last post.  Maybe it's just that my life is busier than it was last summer.    Colin and I have been together for 3 months now, it has been a relationship full of adventures and mishaps, but so far, the good outweighs the bad by a substantial amount.  Since I last wrote, we have gone on two more surf trips, my sorority formal and done the Sun Run.  In March, Colin and I went back to Tofino for a weekend and I finally got up on his surfboard!  Yay, it was a small wave, but at least I managed to stand up.  For the Easter weekend I went down to Oregon with Colin and his friends for a Mexican food fueled surf trip.  We went to Cannon Beach and Seaside and I bought my very own surfboard!  It is bright pink and has black fins and a clear leash!  I should have been studying that weekend, but it was so warm we surfed and lay on the beach in swimsuits and drank beer and daiquiris and ate beef jerky!  Ah well I did study a bit and I still did really well on my exams.  This past weekend Colin and I did the Sun Run.  Neither of us was in top shape, he had hurt his leg the weekend before and I got a really bad cramp halfway through the race, but we still managed to finish the 10 km in about 45 minutes.  Tonight I am going to Colin's initiation into the Legion.  Basically, he just has to recite an oath and have a few beers with the members afterwards so it should be no big deal.  After that, I am off to exercise with Kimi!  In other news, my grandmother died on Sunday evening.  She had been sick all of my life and the doctors never really figured out what was wrong with her.  She smoked for 40 years before she quit a decade ago, but it had done a lot of damage.  She survived at least 3 heart attacks and cancer so it isn't like she went easily.  I'm going to miss her a lot, she was the only person in my life who really accepted me for whom I am and celebrated my achievements more than I did.  She was the first to call the relatives to brag about me and she always told anyone who would listen about her granddaughter.  It is nice to have someone who thinks the world of you, even if you know you don't deserve all of the praise you are getting.  I only wish that she had never smoked, I will always wonder what her life could have been in the past 24 years if she had been in better health and how long she could have lived.  Her own parents lived until they were in their mid-nineties and although they weren't very mobile, they seemed happy.  The times when I will miss her most are when I eventually get married and when I have children.  These are times that I know she would have wanted to witness and times that I wanted her to be with me.  She told me the other year that she would not live that long, but she asked me to give one of my daughters her first name as a middle name and I agreed.    I'm taking my mother to tea on Friday, she needs to get away from the house and away from all of the funeral arrangements for a few hours and I really should spend some time with her.    Anyways on a happy note, I got an A+ on the one course that my grades posted for!  *Listening to Outkast - Hey Ya*

      Four more days until I move in with Colin!  We are both really excited and really nervous at the same time.  Colin told me from the beginning that he thinks that people should live together before getting married and I guess that is what we're doing.  We have only been together four and a half months and I'm still in school, neither one of us is ready for marriage in the next little while, but we want to be together in the future.  After Russ, I said that I'd never live with someone unless I was married, but I need to move out and Colin and I practically live together already.    An update on the psycho roommate, she replaced my bottle of wine, but she is still bad mouthing Colin and me.  She went downstairs and complained about us to his downstairs roommates in what appears to be a bid to turn the entire house against us.  How petty!  Whatever, I doubt that it'll work and it just makes her look whiny.  My birthday is in 3.5 more days!  Woo-hoo I'll be 24!  I'm going to the country bar on Friday to celebrate and on Monday, I'm doing the family dinner thing.  Colin isn't too excited about the country bar, but he's taking me out to get a cowboy hat today!  What a sweetie!  *listening to Sweet Home Alabama and avoiding doing work*

      What a psycho!!!  Colin's roommate has done it again! Yesterday we got back to Colin's about 5:45pm after we had both finished work, the boy was sweet and gave me a ride home from downtown!  I went into Colin's kitchen to get a drink and noticed that my bottle of wine was empty and sitting on the counter.  I went into Colin's room and asked him if he had drunk any wine, giving his roommates the benefit of the doubt.  Colin replied that he hadn't and I said that it was strange that the bottle was empty.  Colin came into the kitchen with me and not only was the bottle empty but Colin's crystal cupboard was wide open and there was a dirty glass on the counter and the cork was laying out on the dining room table.  It was fairly obvious that the wine had been drunk in an effort to provoke an argument.  I told Colin that I felt she needed to explain why she had drank my wine and why she was pissed off with me.  She wasn't home and I had a class to go to so I asked Colin to speak with her when she got home.  I went off to my class and met up with Kimi and we went to the Keg.  During dinner, my phone rang and Colin told me that he and his roommate had just had a gigantic fight.  Apparently, she came home and went into the kitchen, Colin hearing her come in wandered into the kitchen and asked her "what's up?”  She replied, "What are you angry about?"    He stated that he wasn't really angry but he wanted to know what happened to the wine.  She claimed that she thought they shared things in the house and that she had only drank a bit and didn't know what had happened to the rest of the wine.  Basically, it sounds as if she was trying to frame Colin's other roommate, who would never touch anyone else's stuff.  Colin told her it was my wine and that he wanted her to replace it before tomorrow.  He then also told her that she wasn't to use his crystal or any of his dishes or cutlery.  They argued for a while and she yelled at his, "your girlfriend is a bitch," and slammed her door shut.  Colin yelled back that she was a psycho bitch.  The continued yelling at each other down the hall and she started claiming that all of his roommates hated him and that his other female roommate was moving out the next month and that she hoped the next person who moved in hated his girlfriend.  Colin yelled back that the next person moving in was his girlfriend.  They shouted at each other and swore back and forth and she stormed out of the house.  A few minutes later, she called his cell and left a message stating, "Colin, this is Crystal.  If you touch any of my crap I will call the police, I have them on speed dial!"  Colin let me listen to the message and I started laughing, I said "you mean she can't remember 9-1-1, she has to have the number on speed dial she's that stupid?"    Realistically she could call a non-emergency number, but what a retard.  We've never touched her stuff before and she was the one who took something of mine so it was pretty funny.  Luckily, she never came home last night so I haven't run into her yet.  I figure I'll just pretend that Colin didn't tell me what she said about me and I will be super nice to her and make her look like the world's biggest jerk.  Kimi and I figure that she insulted me because she knew it would make Colin angrier than if she had called him a name.  Whatever, only 11 more days and she is out of our lives forever!  Seven if you subtract the days we will be away for during the long weekend.  What drama!  At least in only a few more hours we'll be off on another surf trip... Unfortunately, she may be in Tofino this weekend too, but if we see her, we're going to avoid her.  *listening to the sounds of traffic through the office windows*

      Perhaps the insanity is nearing an end...Colin's new female roommate has given her notice that as of the 1st of June she will be moving out!  Yee-haw!  The bigger news is I'm moving in with Colin as soon as she moves out!!!!  Man is she irritating though!  She moved in the middle of April and has caused so much drama I'm surprised that Colin hasn't lost his mind!  The first day she moved in she spilled beer all over the couch cushions and didn't clean it up, the couch just reeked of stale beer a couple of days later.  The next day she locked herself out of her room, she didn't have a key to the lock on it but she locked it behind her anyways and kept calling Colin to get him to open it for him, but he didn't have the key either.  In the end, she had to get one of the other roommates to force the door open, but didn't even have the decency to phone Colin and tell him that she was in, so we ended up coming home early from our night out for nothing!    Things went okay for another few days and we were thinking that maybe she was just a bit ditzy.  Unfortunately, she blew up a few days later.  Colin had some friends over working on Lee's car in the driveway until pretty late one Wednesday and she flipped because she said she couldn't get her 8 hours of sleep and absolutely HAD to call in sick to work because she was tired...boo-friggin-hoo.  She and Colin had a big discussion and determined that after 10:30pm on weeknights it would be quiet in the house.  This seemed to work out well for a week or so, but then Colin and I went away for the weekend for a surf trip and came back to another explosion.   While we were away, the smoke alarm needed batteries (how earth shattering) and the sink started leaking (heck these things happen, one day at the frat they were fixing the sink and just left us a hole with no faucet for 24 hours).  When she came home, Colin asked to speak with her about the new lock on her door.  He told her that as her landlord he needed a key and gave various reasons as to why.  She stated that if that were the case she would give her rent notice.  If that wasn't over the top, the next stuff she had to say was both insulting and insane.  She said that anyone going in to Colin's room would have access to the key and specifically said "Cryssie could go into my room" um sorry I respect people's privacy and have never given her any reason to think that I would ever touch any of her things.  At this point, I was in the shower cleaning out the wetsuits, so I overheard everything, but she couldn't see me.  I was steamed over her accusation, but opted to talk to Colin and not her about it.    As I was finishing up with the wetsuits I noticed the time, it was about the time she usually got ready for bed so I decided that to be considerate I would leave some of the wetsuit stuff unfinished so that she could get ready for bed and I would finish up after she was done.  Well, she took one look at the mess (it wasn't that bad, just a bit of water on the floor and a Rubbermaid bucket by the toilet) and started slamming doors and kicking the Rubbermaid around.  I told Colin why I left the stuff out and he helped me clean up after she got out of the bathroom.  I also told him how insulted I was by her insinuating that I would go into someone else's things and said that I no longer felt welcome in his house and wanted to leave.  He asked me not to punish him for her actions and said that he would talk to her, so I decided to stay the night anyways.  She also accused him of not paying rent and using the roommates' money to go surfing with.  She actually went and talked to everyone in the house and asked him or her what he or she paid and complained about stuff to him or her.  Colin wasn't please and felt that she was trying to turn people against him for her benefit.  He assured her that he too pays rent and told her that he did not appreciate her running around talking about him behind his back.  Colin and Her Royal Highness did not talk for a couple of days, but when they did, it seemed that the chaos and fighting had finally ended for good.  She gave him a key to the room and apologized for dragging me into her rant about the lock.  While she didn't apologize to me directly, I was willing to move forward.  Colin went away for to Whistler this past Saturday and returned to find a note on his door informing him that she was moving out.  We assumed something had gone on over the weekend to piss her off, but neither of us was sad to hear that she was leaving.  It turns out that she had just found a place on her own that was cheap.  Apparently, she had always wanted a place to herself but had previously been unable to find one in her price range.  All seemed well, until yesterday morning.  I woke up around 7am to shower, but thought that she was in there, so I assumed she had chosen to shower earlier than her usual 7:20am time.  As I presumed she was done I got in the shower around 7:20am and was calmly rinsing my hair when this wild banging began on the bathroom door.  Since it was crazy banging and not a friendly please hurry I need in knock I chose not to respond verbally, instead I just hurried up and got ready to get out as fast as I could.  Colin, hearing this banging got up to see why someone was terrorizing me first thing in the morning.  She then started screaming at him to get me out of there because I don't pay rent and it was her shower time and she only had 15 minutes until she had to leave and so on.  I emerged from the bathroom as soon as I was sure I wouldn't run into her and went into Colin's room.  He looked at me and said, "Don't say sorry, just say Surrey."  We looked at the clock, my entire shower had taken under 5 minutes and she didn't even go into the bathroom for 10 minutes after I had vacated it!  I think she wanted to blame me for her not getting a shower....aigh!  I hid in Colin's room until I heard her go into the bathroom because I didn't feel like being screamed at.  Colin called me later on that day to make sure I was feeling okay and told me that he thinks she's psycho and is glad she is moving out.  Later that night when she came home, she tried guilt tripping him.  Her boyfriend broke up with her and then she went off on Colin that she thought that when she moved in they were going to be friends and that he would go surfing with her and blah blah blah.  What a dumbass, if you treat a guy's girlfriend badly why is he going to want to invite you anywhere?  Ah well when it all comes down to it I won, she treated me badly and he stuck up for me, so while the drama was unnecessary, all's well that ends with her moving out!  I haven't told my parents that I'm moving out.  I think it will go over like a ton of bricks tied to a herd of elephants, but I've been arguing with them for the past while and I think it is the right decision to move.  My mother threatened last week that she would throw my things out onto the lawn and took away the car for a week over my supposed offensive tone of voice!  Yikes, I'm only 23 going on 24 on the 31st!    Yesterday after all the drama, I saw Melissa.  We had a crazy driving filled day.  Our round trip was over 300km!  We went and played mini golf and arcade games at a theme park, ate dinner at a Chinese Buffet, shopped at Ikea, and played card games at her house.  It was tons of fun and I even got a hole-in-one on the 18th hole that won me a free game!    The weekend was pretty good too, on Friday I went to the Roxy with Nikki, Kim, and Michelle, it was somewhat dull at the club, but it was good to see Kim again!  On Saturday, it was the infamous Hose Reel festival (read giant friggin beer garden) and I finally went this year.  I met up with Allea, Wendy, Heidi, and Adrian and we drank, lay in the sun, and listened to live bands.  Afterwards Allea and I went back to Heidi and Adrian’s, chatted until 1am, and ate Greek food that we ordered in.  On Sunday, the very hung over boyfriend was back from Whistler.  We went for Thai and dessert with his friend Peter and his wife Evelyn.  It was nice to see them again and it was interesting to try my first Thai dishes.  Monday was great too!  Colin and I both had the day off so we slept in and then made a late breakfast with his downstairs roommate Bryan.  After that we ran errands, played pool and darts at the Legion, planted a garden, and I washed Colin's truck while he mowed the lawn.  After all that Heidi and Adrian came over and we had dinner and looked at my surfboard and some cute Colin and Cryssie surf trip photos!    To conclude this very long post I'll just say that I'm very happy right now and am optimistic about living with Colin!  *listening to absolutely no music because I haven't bought new headphones yet*

      I have been living with Colin for a month and a half now.&nbsp; It is basically going well, we have our little arguements, but overall we are happy.&nbsp; Last weekend we went surfing in Oregon, it was nice and hot and I spent a ton on cute clothes, but hey no sales tax in Oregon.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm working a lot and I'm tutoring once a week, but I'm still managing to get in some time in the sun.&nbsp; I'm sick with a cold though, so I think I'll end this post.&nbsp; So much for updating my blog...sniffle cough... ugh.
