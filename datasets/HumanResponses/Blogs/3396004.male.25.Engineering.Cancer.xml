      Now a days nothing much has been going on in my life...Except for the ' bug ' of ' having a webpage for myself'  that had caught me recently...Currently I am working on it and it may be out in a few weeks if I am  satisfied  with wat I will have then....I'll talk abt that some other time...  Yesterday I have seen a french movie named  'Ameli' , It was quite a different movie, different in every sense. 80% of the time it was narrative. Rather than having a concrete story the maker of the movie choose to simply narrate the happenings in life of a girl named Ameli, from her birth till the time she finds a boy friend for herself. As it doesnt go on predictable lines, as normal movies, It keeps the viewers on their toes, making them try to guess the next scene.   Though I am not going to deal with the movie in entirity in here, I shall touch upon a few interesting things of the movie. One of the guy in the movie has certain interesting hobbies. Making a album out of torn pieces of photographs found in trash and Collecting the photographs of peoples foot prints. His collection really looks kool in the movie. It seems that one the friend of the director of the movie had such crazy hobbies, thats wat prompted the diro to include those in the movie.   Another captivating aspect of the movie is that instead of looking at macro-level things of life, the movie looks at micro-level things. Did I confuse u...Damn sure I did...for e.g. The protagonist who is not allowed to play with kids of her age by her parents, derives pleaseure by making skims on water, by dipping her fingers in a bag full of grains , things like that..such minute details were captured pretty well by the diro....Still dint get it...May be I am not good at expressing..Watch the movie when u have an oppurtunity, to understand wat I am talking abt....

      The Lakshya of this blog is to give my opinion on the movie Lakshya...  Yep I saw this movie a coupla days back...Without beating around the bush I will directly get to the point....Lemme first look at the movie at macrolevel i.e over all impressions rather than going to details...  Pluses  : Wonderful Screenplay & Direction, Fairly realistic(though it had its little doses of filminess...), Good Music, Excellent Photography, Well Executed scenes, Excellent peformances...and the beat goes on...  Minuses : Lengthy, wrong placing of coupla songs, Yeah I really dont think of any other negatives abt the movie  Though the movie was branded by some of the ppl as "An Individual's Journey"...Its more than that...It has a soft romantic story, and some well executed war sequences embedded in that Journey....The High light of the movie according to me is the Rock Climbing Scene which was just awesome....It may come as a surprise but for me this the Best movie of Hrithik so far...may it be the dances r the action scenes Hrithik proved that he is the Best.....He shud consider doing more of such roles in future...He was well supported by the other cast....Zinta, Amitabh ji, Om Puri Ji, Boman Irani, Sushanth and others, everyone did their role with commitment...  Though the narration is a little slow at times, nevertheless U wont get bored anywhere. The director shud have removed the 2 songs in the second half as they were speed breakers to the already slow paced narration.....  Over all Farhan Akthar had done a commendable job in bringing out such a sensible movie. His and his father's research on army lifes ,rules, and regulations can be clearly seen on the screen. I really njoyed the movie a lot and I recommend everyone to watch atleast once....

      Let me at the very outset tell U that I am introduced to this Blog bug by my IITM pals Vaas and Daks. Thanks to u doods...  As is everybody's initial concern, so is mine: Wat the hell do I name my Blog ??? Lemme make an attempt here, Shud it be related to wat I am, wat I do, wat I don't, wat the hell !!!  If I do so then It will no more be a title of this blog, it will be title of my autobiography (who the hell is interested in that now).... Nope this is not the way to go abt it...Lemme try to KISS..Oops !! Did I say that, Don't mistake me for a pervert, By KISS I mean " K eep  I t  S hort &  S imple".   I love oxymorons may be my title shud be one...may be not...  Shud it be abt How much I miss India and my frens.... Shud it be abt my passion for movies.....  Hmmm... Looks like this is going to be a tough one for me... I think rather than concentrating on 'wat the hell the title shud be'...I better be concerned abt the content....Yes this is the best way to go abt it... Work on the body of the Blog and the title will just fall in place...  Wonderful...looks like this works...gr8
