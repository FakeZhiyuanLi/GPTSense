      ok.  im finally home and the day was boring. I skipped peace 2 work on a weird "science" poem with brycelyn. ya i no fun. :( lol. anyways... people kept coming in to the room and being like, "what r u doing??"  Well me and bry got sooooo annoyed after a while and informed everyone that we were ditching. Then, they would run away because they are scared to be caught with "ditchers". Well news to all u ppl who asked me and bry why we werent in class: we were not ditching. we just think ur annoying.  French was hilarious... my best friends ever: mia, laughs alot. ALOT. AALLOOTT!!! Well me and the kids at my table were joking and stuff. it was kinda funny. She had a HUGE laughing fit which made me laugh 2. Jack told us that on the last day of french there would be no party. He sed that we would "reflect" on the year. yes, thats right. solitude and reflection for the fccs butterfly diverse freak school. Mia asked him if we could reflect "honestly". It was so funny! yes...                                    JACK IS A JACKASS!  I guess im happy that school is almost over... ok i just lied. I hate changes and want to stay with my friends and stay 13. Ok... no im not a freak who wants to go away to never ever land or anything, but my parents suck and if i get bad report cards which i will, i am grounded... so i dont c my friends... the WHOLE summer!!! Yes thats right. I am grounded 4 life. Im not kidding or anything. ive already been grounded 4 a year. well o well ill get over it someday.  o yeah... and when i got home i was locked out of my home... so i attempted to pick the lock of my door. I failed. my sister got home, she got a ride with one of her bff, maddie. Then maddie left and me and my sister shaina were stranded with out a key. then 5 minutes later, my mom and brother got home.

(sarcasm) well actually MAYBE it will. i just had a bottle of bubbly sparkiling seltzer water. :) I dont no wut 2 get dan and sam 4 there birthdays.... they wont tell me. sam ses money, but im not doing money. Dan ses a fish to feed to his fish. NO IM NOT DOING THAT!! yes he was kidding. my family is going camping July 1st to July 8th or 9th in cape cod. ok. thats fine. but why do we need 2 start packing 3 weeks in advance? my mom doesnt like rushing or suprises. she likes to be prepared and pack alot in advance. all of my clothes r packed! wut do i where 2 school? lol  my bro is in a bad mood. hes yelling at me. awwww now im sad. jp  lyl

      Ok so i got report cards.. they were pretty good...  mostly meetings with 1 or 2 apprach and 1 or 2 exceeds. If you go to a normal un butterflyish school, then heres translation: meeting is b+ or A-           apprach is c+ or b-          exeeds is A+ or better... like exceeding the standards... get it? haha i do Anyways... That averages to all around meetings, which is good. I tried so hard. When my report cards suck, i get in BIG trouble, but when they are good, it doesnt matter??! This 1 was good and all my parents had to say was "oh.. ok" OMG!!!! ROAR!!! WELL OH OK 2 THEM 2!!!!   I QUIT SCHOOL!!!  update- i got ugrounded that night

      A few days ago i went to the mall with mia, it was very fun and we got clips. She almost lost her clip. It was a lil crises. She found it tho and by this time 2day, shes on the plane to Dominica. I have completly lost my voice. My mom says to drink tea. I dont really like tea. I just woke up. my dad is at work and my mom isnt home either. Yesterday one of my fishes died. :(   Sad   Very very bored 2day cause I have nothing to do. NOTHING. I cant make plans either cause my parents have a thing about making plans 2 close 2 vacation... -_- I am still kinda sick, o yea, thats why i lost my voice.   lyl

      I woke up at 7:00 2day and babysat 2 lil boys. one of them is 8 and the other is 6. They can go from nice to devil in a matter of seconds. They kept trying 2 beat eachother up... and there 2 small... so they cant... lol. I feel kinda bad 4 these kids tho... there mom gives them homework that she prepares. ... Even in the summer! I have 2 wait on them like a slave. eh. I got 50$ though.. I have a delema.. my mom decided 2 help me pack my bags 4 vacation... thats ok. the bad part is that about 4 months ago she gave me a lil jacket thing. Its crucial to have it and its GONE. Shes like "find it" im not gonna b able 2. Ive tried. Its gone with the wind.

       Im going to the cape tomorrow. My parents made me clean all day. I feel  like cinderella but less pretty. And with no ball. And with no mice.  And with no fairy god mother. Wow. thats depressing! My sister and me  were tired after cleaning, and my bro ditched us to get the s.u.v, so  we made oatmeal crap. It was 100 times better then chicken crap. (dont  ask) We took oatmeal and put in a pile of suger and crap, so it tasted  like sugar crap, so it was pleasently gross. Im gonna miss all my  friends soooo much in cape cod. And espesually mia cause shes in  dominica and because shes my bff. And espesually dan too, cause hes  going away for 4 or 5 days too and stuff. Oh yeah, i hit my toe  accidentally and now it hurts. Alot. :( I was attacked my 1000 fruit  flys. I fought back with raid bug spray which doesnt actually do  anything but make me feel happy that i am hitting those bitches with  spray and give my sister athsma. I couldnt breath it either. I  evacuated that room in a matter of minutes. I am so so so so so excited  to go to ptown. its gonna be awsome. Well, it will be if we dont need  to hike that horrible bike trail again. hehehe. that was funny. ugh  sry, another inside joke with myself... :/ AAAAAnyways i wont be  writing for the next 10 days or so because ill be in capw cod... buy

       yesterday i got home from cape cod and ptown. I had been gone for 10 days. It was awsome. Ptown is a party town and i saw like 100 drag queens. I went to the beach almost every day. Im the only person who can go to the beach 9 days in a row for about 4 hours a day without getting a tan. :( I saw seals. The beach we found was BEUTIFUL. It had no mung.You need to walk down the dunes to get there. My brother made an effort to teach me how to skim board. I suck at it. hehe. I had to go on a whale watch. I HATE whales they are so scary. We mostly saw sharks though. In ptown i bought a pile of stuff. I bought a kimonoe, which is one of those lil chinese or japenese robes. I bought 2 shark tooth necklices. I bought betty boo pajams. i bought earings. I bought this lil chinese umbrella thing for a friend. I bought lip gloss. I THINK thats all. We were camping the whole time. 10 days. I had to share a tent with my sister. O yeah, Im addicted to good and plentys now. heh. When I got back yesterday, my neighbors were moving. One of them ased me if i wanted there bicicle, I said sure. Now I have a crappy old bike. Its something,.. sleeping in my own bed last night was wonderful.

       im sleepy and kinda in a bad mood. I was riding the crappy old bike to  get a coolata. thats why im sleepy. The bad mood comes from many  things...    first of all, i want mia to come home from dominica i miiis her     2cd, i cant find my phone which is in my lost purse so when she DOES get back, i cant call her    3rd, i found this really annoying website and it pissed me off    4th,  there are 130 people on my buddy list for aol, (i can only have 200)  and i only ever talk to 2-4 or something. WHY WONT I JUST DELETE THE  OTHER 125 THEN?? i dunno. i just wont. this is also weird cause during  the school year i talk to about 10 people on aim or something. Yes, i  know. still rather pathetic but come to think of it, i dont have that  many friends who have aim... i dont even have that many friends.     ahhhhhhhhhhh  this mood sucks. I dont want chocolite like i usually do to fix my bad  moods but not 2day cause in cape cod i had way 2 much chocolite and im  sick of it... i should go sleep

       i couldnt sleep last night. My cat slept in the middle of my bed and  didnt wanna move so i felt bad and let her stay.... I got in bed at  10;00 and from 10:00 until 11:00 i couldnt sleep and then i woke up and  12:00 and then i woke up again at 4:00. So yes, im sleepy. my cat  stayed on my bed THE WHOLE NIGHT!!!!! urg it was annoying. Do u no whos  fault this is? no. you probably dont so i will tell you. Its shaina's  fault. before i went to bed i went in her room cause i was bored and  lonely. DO YOU NO WHAT SHE SAID??? no you dont. I will tell you. She  said,"take the cat from my room into yours if your lonely, she keeps  trying to bite me." I was thinking that this would be a good thing but  it wasnt. I usually love my cat sitting on my bed... at the end of  it... in the corner... giving me space... not in the middle of it... in  the center... so I have to sleep on the corner. I should have slept on  my bean bag chair. well actually, those do not make good beds at all.  Ive tried them. ohhhhhhh and by the way... if your wandering about the  title of this my cats name is artimas.    oh and you no what else?  no. you dont. so i will tell you. my brother is being.... sososoos  annoying and evil! i dont think you want me spending 20 minutes  explaining our petty fight, so ill leave it at this: my brother is  annoying and evil.

      This morning i drove in the car for 45 minutes and the damn pool was closed so i didnt go swimming. Im bored to tears. As always. Yes. Yesterday i went to cvs with mom and bought a shitload of stuff. Garnier fructise shampoo and conditioner, facial scrubs, those cute lil plastic sheets, a comb, anti frizzer, and a bunch of other stuff i didnt need. Most of my friends use garnier fructis too, but there hair is still 100 times better. sigh. O well. I guess ill go with plan B... Shave it all off and become a monk... or not. Its hot. I dont like my siblings. rarr. I was just watching "made". I hate that show. Its just ppl deciding that they dont wanna be thereself anymore. There like "turn me into a hip hop danser!" "turn me into a skateboarder" "turn me punk" "turn me cool" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ugh i hate it. ahghghgh i wanna leave the house. My friends are busy though. there always busy. everyones always busy except me. k done complaining. actually no. Im not. I made a blof to complain and so here we go....  -i hate boredom  -i hate cheese  -i hate doing the dishes  -I hate the song im listening to  -i hate boots  -i hate unhappyness  -i hate un electric toothbrushes  -i hate seosoned nuts  -i hate closed pools  -i hate ppl being busy  -i hate yelling  -i hate pain  -i hate "made"  -i hate melted gum  -i hate bad aftertastes  -i hate headaches  -i hate advil it doesnt work  -i hate things that dont work  the end 4 now  ******************************************  later that day...  I went to the newton shopping mall place to meet my moms friend anne. She works at this "safera" place and always gives free stuff. Shes really nice.  Her daughter just ran away and became a prostitute in nyc and wont come home. since anne's daughter is only 17, anne is sad. I think her daughter should come home! she already got kidnapped. Anyways, we went to go have lunch. I had pizza and ice cream dessert. mmm. Ya, so that was fun.    my sister has been teaching me how to write in japenese. Its really cool. Its a sound language. I know what most of the symbles are. :)    We all had lunch

      slushy spoons are one of the greatest inventions ever! not only can you eat slush with them, but when the slush melts (as it usually does) you can drink it! YOU CAN DRINK IT! i just had a watermelon slush and it was good. the slush spoon made it even better.   the label:  Richies  since 1956  classic italian slush

      I couldnt go to the movies/ mall with a friend cause i thought i was gonna paint my room. I thought i was gonna paint my room with a friend today, but i couldnt cause it takes more preperation. Then i thought i could sleep over a friends house, but i cant because apperantly, i cant stay home alone at someone elses house for a few hours. Then, i thought i was gonna go to the mall with some friends today, but i couldnt call anyone cause i had to get off the phone. I had to hang up on my friend in the middle of a conversation, and couldnt call her back. I think shes mad at me, but im not sure. IM SO SORRY. My mom felt sorry for me, and so she made my dad and sister take me to lunch but unfortunatelly, she told me once they were already outside waiting- so i had no time to shower, get dressed, or brush my screwed up hair. Im starving, and theres no food in the house.  ya... fun day. FUNFUNFUN I HAD A BLAST I WISH I COULD WAKE UP AND LIVE IT AGAIN... -_-  this sucked.
