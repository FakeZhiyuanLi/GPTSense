      It is the end of a fairly long Monday.  I had some very odd dreams and woke up feeling like shit.  Got through the run okay and had a pretty solid training session before eating two breakfasts.  The pleasure of belting down a VITAMILK soymilk and then scoffing chilli infested rice and chicken and veg with a fried egg on top is one I hope not to forget.  Then I e-mailed.  Following that I wandered around in a daze, sweating and looking for ice-cream.  I fell into a filthy hot sleep at a decidedly queer angle on my bed (mattress = rock) at 1pm.  I kept waking up and seeing that it was ten minutes later and nowhere near 3pm yet and going back to sleep.    Then it was three, so I swore and shat and got my runners on again.  Yoshi was waiting.  Training was better in the afternoon. Some ex-champ fella from the 70s came by and showed us how to be totally sweet by using rediculous footwork.  He also showed me how to stop kicking like a jessy.    Fay really took the piss out of me (not in an unkind way) in kick sparring.  There is something a bit rubbish about having your foot caught, thrown away and then getting slap-kicked in the bottom.  It is all about blocking and returning fire real quick.  Kicks taken on the arms still score in Thailand.  When you block, you block with the leg.  Anyway, Fay was a Lumpini champion so if he wants to kick me in the asshole, that's fine.    I am off to bed I think.  You better hope I sleep well.  My chat is directly related to kip.

      I have made a blog.  I don't even know what the hell a blog is but i have made one.  I shall be posting a whole heap of crap in here about how much fun I am having in Thailand so that I can make some of you very unhappy indeed, through jealousy.  I am a bad, bad person.  But most of you already know that.  So how are you????????????

      Every massage here is a little different.  Thai massage differs from western massage (Swedish an that).  It focuses on pressure points I think.  I can't be arsed giving the Lonely Planet chat on it.  Thai massage hurts.  A man or a woman presses thumbs into your muscle until it really hurts.  They pull your legs and stand on your back and dig elbows into your shoulders.  Afterwards you feel ace.    I've had a good few massages here.  It's a graet way to chill out after a week or even a couple of days of training.  Yesterday Kim and I went to a place to get the knots sorted out after our 14 hour train journey to Chiang Mai.    The masseeueuueueurs were all blind, as were the receptionist and all staff.  Kim took the lady and I laid down in front of a big ole burly blind man called Punya.  Punya smiled pretty much non stop as he administered a great, intimate and overwhelming pain to almost every part of my body.  I know the Thai for pain.  I said it when it was too much.  At this Punya continued, ignoring me.  Then at other times he would be gently massaging another bit and ask me if it hurt.  "No it doesn't hurt there.  Did you see me trying to squirm off the mattress a minute ago, though?  Can you hear it when I whimper?"  I am not joking.  This man was properly strong and could squash his thumb into my thigh so hard that the muscle parted and he hit bone.    I know it is good pain.  I am used to that, but Punya's was extra specially painful pain.  I think he is just really good at what he does.  Today I feel great.  Any pulled muscles and tight shoulders and bumped feet are gone and I am set back to square one.  It is like good stretching.  Can't believe we don't really have this at home.  I think it is absolutely amazing as an aid to good health.  I am not sure whether I will go back to Punya though.

      Got up at 6 today.  Not really at my best at 6am on Sunday.  We went to the gym.  Today is Pa Tem's birthday.  He is the big pimpin owner of the gym.  It was also the day that the gym got blessed by buddhist monks from the temple up the road.    Yesterday we took down all the bags and tidied the gear into one side of the ring.  This morning the ropes were slack and decorative mats had been laid down to cover the ground.  A small shrine was in one corner and five pots sat ready for offerings.  There was a crowd of friends and family dressed up milling around preparing great masses of food.  Shoes off on the mats and don't point your feet at anything.  Five monks trooped in, aged about 75 down to 5, I reckon.  They sat in the ring with Pa Tem and chanted in dulcet tones, all holding a peice of white string between thumbs.  Sitting in a polite position, not pointing feet at the holy dudes, I had to change sitting position every few minutes.  Sasaki-san chanted along with the monks and elder women but his chant was in Japanese and it was all filth.  He was talking about poking Youshi in the bum and going to see a ladyboy prostitute.  He went on to suggest that Youshi was getting a stiffy and that it was quite inappropriate.  It is often difficult not to giggle on such a solemn occassion.  When Sasaki is on form, it is impossible.    Some of the men, lead by Nim Nuam, gathered offerings and we crammed them into the pots of the five.  Rice in banana leaves, fruit and a variety of sweets were hurredly offered.  Then breakfast came out.  Huge trays of five main dishes and several wee ones were laid in front of each monk.  All were given enormous mounds of rice and sticky rice and jelly and banana in coconut milk.  All of this food was walked past me for four very skinny blokes.  If we were to wait for them to finish it all, my legs would never again be straightened, my lower back would have exploded and it would be tomorrow.  Thankfully after taking their fill the ceremony ended and after shaking holy water over us (the crowd were loving that), the orange robed dudes trooped out again.  We ate.  I resisted Pa Tem's offers: "that raw beef dish will make you strong!".  He is right in the sense that making you strong is akin to making you shit blood for a week.  No, for me it was a good helping of everything else and then bananas in coconut milk.  Bananas in coconut milk are hard to beat.    Pretty cool way to spend a Sunday.  I resisted Sasaki's suggestion that I lift the robe of one of the elderly monks.  He is a dirty, dirty pervert.

      Today I found out that my girlfriend is now Dr Kim Rollinson.  This means that I never have to work again.  She has consented to support me as I train here for ten years.  I am hoping that she can also find a cure for sweat.  Very proud.

      Today Nim Nuam, the head trainer, took me aside at the end of the morning session and whispered into my ear.  He told me the secrets of Muay Thai.  I knew it was only a matter of time.  I want to say a massive well done to all the Caley Muay Thai fighters who took part in the Cleland show and Birkenhead before it.  Sounds like everyone did well.  Especially Hilary and Katherine who have belts now.  Maybe show us macho men how to be proper hard.  Think I'm gonna take tomorrow off.  My calfs are totally solid.

      I just got tossed about the ring like a wet dishcloth.  Clinching wants practised a lot.    If anyone went to Cleland at the weekend, give us some fight reports.    Monday was a brilliant day's training.  It started with pishing rain so we skipped instread of running.  Then loads and loads of pads and bags.  Nim Nuam had a hangover so he decided to work everyone very hard.  If you are looking really spent he just puts the pads in front of his belly and walks towards you saying "foot kick".  It is exhausting just trying to keep the bugger away.  Then its "ten right kick" usually at the end of the round but now interspersed.  Just as you start to get fit he ups the work rate so you never climb out of the ring feeling super.  This is good training.  The key is to keep that work ethic when you are on the bag alone and that is not so easy.    Sparred with Maki who is apparently the number two lightweight in Japan.  He kicked my heavy ass.  But not in a nasty way.    The park is clearly limited.  I am thinking of starting running out of town in random directions just to break up the monotony.   There is a man here called Liam.  He has 'Western man been to long in asia-itis'.  He is a wierdo from Canada.  Very abrupt and suspicious.  Went to a bar and he spent all night chatting up young girls with some extremely gay giggly Thai chat.  At home he is a specky bloke.  Here he is a Thai speaking, English teaching, Visa holding mutha.  He also knows everything.  Must be lonely out here in Ubon for a long time as a westerner, but you really want to work on your chat if you want to befriend the passing whities.  I'm crap at first impressions anyway.  He'll probably turn out to be a great lad.    I am off to ma bed.

      Today is the day to chill out and not run anywhere.  I will be trying to eat as many meals as possible today.    The large Eric lost his fight on points.  He faced a good kicker who was more experienced (60 fights) and it showed.  It was pretty close though as Eric used his weight and reach to force in some boxing.  Yoshi won in some style pulling back an early deficit with a stream of elbows in the second.  It was an intelligent, measured performance to be proud of with strong kicks being traded throughout.  Phi used all his experience to make his toned opponent look foolish in the latter rounds.  He won clearly despite no training.    I got stared at a lot because I am big and white with funny round eyes.    The fights made me want to train very hard indeed.  It is a very different game over here but the same rule that hard training pays off in the ring is utterly indisputable.  I have been offered a fight in a week but I am not gonna take one yet.  I am not in good enough shape and I have hardly sparred.  Ronald Reagan is pan bread.    Phi fought last night too because he is mental.  I hear he lost.  This may be owing to the fags he was smoking on Friday night, washed down with whisky and no sleep.  He also had a bit of a sore leg because he fought the day before.  Poofter.  Not much to report only that I am nearly finished 'Toast' the biography of Nigel Slater and I am starting to panic.  Must get more books in future.  But perhaps not ones with in depth descriptions of western food on every page.  EVERY PAGE.

      Tonight is the night that the fighting will be happening.  Yes, in a field somewhere in Ubon (for the Scooter fans) they will whack up a ring and some chairs so big old Eric can kick some wee Thai fella from 3 meters away.  I can't wait.  Thought I would let all the thai boxing folk know what training here consists of.  It is, needless to say, gonna be boring to everyone else.  I will also probablty lie so you think I am harder than I am.  Summer of 69 plays about 25243 times every time I listen to Virgin radio.  Fucking hell.  6:30am walk to park and run round it 7 times (on the outside) or about 45 mins.  Then walk to gym and skip 3X5 min rounds.  Then I shadow box for 1 or 2 rounds until I get asked to "stand by" for 3X5 min pad rounds.  This is the highlight of the training.  Then maybe a round or two on bag.  Then 100 situps and 50 pushups and stretchin.  I have done a wee bit of sparring and clinching but I think they are wantign me to get the fitness and technique before I get into it more.  So I go home and wash and eat at about 9/9:30.  I usually kip for an hour or two before the afternoon session.  3pm to park for 5Xinside or about 25 mins running.  Same stuff as morning at the gym with a couple more shadow and bag rounds.  Go home at about 6:30/7.    I think this will build up over time as I get the fitness.  I had to take a day off yesterday as I was pooped.  I think it is just the heat.  Thighs are like rock all time from the running.  Thai massage is a brilliant way to end the week of training.  Got some burly madam to beat the hell out of me yesterday and felt better for it.   Off to watch the fights. Ooh It's a Kind of Magic is on now.  Virgin is forgiven.

      Well hello.  My thighs are on fire; my feet are disintegrating and there is a young man looking at pron on the computer next to mine.  Dirty little begger.  He has gone for the Japanese variety.  Soft core but he seems to be loving it by the tapping of his foot.   A good training session today.  I have discovered a right kick, previously notable by its absence.  Nim Nuam is the dad of pad holders.  He has coached a good few Lumpini champions (including his brother who now hates him.  Do not ask) and now gets paid to teach rich, sweaty farang (foreigners) not to be utterly rubbish at thai.  He has a wonderful fatherly demeanor and really gets the best out of his fighters.  The fact that I have, to date, kneed him in the chin through the pads, should be glossed over.  Maybe just a note to say that I am an asshole.  I ate Japanese food tonight and it were pure magic!  Yoshi and Eric are chillin tomorrow.  Maybe just a bit of shadow boxing to keep ticking over until they fight on Friday.  Eric is 90 kilos.  His opponent will be 75 but more experienced.  Still, at 6 foot 4 he should have a reach advantage.  Big Norwegian get.  I am off to ma scratcher.

      and i have replaced the dummy in my mouth and am suckling nicely.&nbsp;   after some extremely sensible words from good friends and family and time to reflect i have pulled my shit back together after being pretty miserable yesterday.&nbsp; anyway, chris horne (gay) will tell you i was miserable after my first fight and i won that one.&nbsp; stupid bloody sport.  watched the video of the fight last night.&nbsp; it was like i remembered it.&nbsp; there's good bits in there like when i teeped (push kicked) him in his face.&nbsp; a sign of great disrespect to thais i am told, but he had already booted me in the sack about 3 times by then.&nbsp; a deeply heartfelt "thank you" to youshi for lending me his sweaty, just used wrought-iron bawguard.&nbsp; he was right, "plastic, no good".&nbsp;   a wee note on clinching (he kneed me down there too you know).&nbsp; every time we got into the clinch the referee kept talking until we broke it.&nbsp; my mind started to wander.&nbsp; i thought he was giving the thai fella advice.&nbsp; i still don't know what he was saying but it freaked me right out.&nbsp; not cool.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  still not happy with it overall but i think i learned a great deal.&nbsp; 5X3 rounds is a different sport entirely.&nbsp; so much time to think and try to outwit your opponent.&nbsp; from watching other fights i have seen the balance of control shift visibly from round to round.&nbsp; youshi was getting pasted in round one and i would have put money on the knockout.&nbsp; his opponent seemed unassailably strong but youshi came back in and traded technique looking for big elbows.&nbsp; the fight went on for 5 rounds with both fighters taking countless full-on elbows.&nbsp; it was the best fight i have ever seen.&nbsp; youshi is a fighter (not a boxer, i.e. hard as nails as opposed to technical) but he showed such composure and variation of shots.&nbsp; that's him on 5 wins 5 losses in thailand now.&nbsp; some guy. &nbsp; tonight is the famed candle festival in ubon.&nbsp; i am delighted to be here at the right time as it promises to be quite a shindig.&nbsp; and me, post fight, able to drink beer?&nbsp; smashing.&nbsp; i hope to divert big mike in the direction of beer and ruin his training completely.&nbsp; he has taken to it like it was his job.&nbsp; i don't think the pad-holders are overly psyched by his enormous legs smashing into their pads dailly.&nbsp;   thanks again to all for the tremendous post fight words.&nbsp; i will endevour to be less moany in all future posts.

      The only way i can think to do this is to write what i was feeling after the fight last night.&nbsp; i couldn't get to the internet then so this is the morning after.  i have never felt so alone in my life, nor wished so much to be left alone.&nbsp; i was utterly dispondent and shit fun all night despite my friends' best efforts to say the right thing (impossible).&nbsp; i am particularly indebted to shino, my nextdoor neighbour who sat up until 5am shooting the shit with me about japan's military action in iraq and dogs.&nbsp;   i am fine.&nbsp; my shins hurt like hell and my right elbow is a bit sore but all else is fine.&nbsp; i lost unequivocally in 5 X 3 minute rounds.&nbsp; Youshi lost an awesome battle; Nishi got knocked out cold by a spectacular jumping head-kick (he is okay now) and Shino lost a hard 5 rounder to a south paw with a relentless left kick.&nbsp;   i weighed in at a dodgey 75 kilos fully clothed on suspect scales.&nbsp; my opponent was about 62/63 kilos and shorter than me.&nbsp; i remember meeting him in the middle of the ring and blocking the first right low kick.&nbsp; it hurt like hell.&nbsp; in my three scottish fights i have never felt pain until the next day.&nbsp; i knew that every time he kicked me it was gonna hurt a lot.&nbsp; the first round was okay.&nbsp; a lot of standing around and a bit of clinching which i think i won with stronger knees.&nbsp; i'm not gonna give a blow by blow account.&nbsp; the first round means very little anyway.&nbsp; the whole fight merged into an endless repetition of me standing there and allowing myself to be kicked in the arms and legs without committing to counter properly.&nbsp; i didn't get going at all.&nbsp;   i can't ever remember feeling more ashamed than i did when&nbsp;i exited the ring.&nbsp; i cannot find any excuses in my fitness or technique or opponent's skill.&nbsp; it was just a case of not having the balls to win.&nbsp; couldn't look anyone in the eye after the fight.&nbsp; sasaki handed me my 2000 baht which i didn't want.&nbsp; i felt strongly that i would have gladly swapped fights with nishi and taken the knockout.&nbsp; anything would have been better than this.&nbsp; the thought that i am in the wrong sport was prominent in my mind and&nbsp;there was a leap in my respect for proper thai fighters.&nbsp;   this morning i did my laundry.&nbsp; it's gonna be a miracle if the thai oil comes out of my new Beer Chiang sponsored shorts.&nbsp; i can't believe that was on TV.&nbsp; the couple at the breakfast joint&nbsp;watched it.&nbsp; two more people that i had to look in the eye this morning.  fucking hell i am sure this grim mood will not last.&nbsp; it was another experience that i would not trade and i have learned a great deal from it.&nbsp; thanks to everyone for all the good lucks and "knock him out"s.&nbsp; mike brought along two scotland flags and i am glad that i did not wear either in to the ring.&nbsp; i will try and watch the video at some point and see what i think then.&nbsp; this usually puts things in perspective.&nbsp;

      well here we are in the cafe d'internet once more as i try to waste the time until sleep.&nbsp; everyone bar the fighters have gone to watch maki fight tonight.&nbsp; wish i could be there to support him but its an early start tomorrow and we got told to chill out.&nbsp;   it is very boring waiting for a fight.&nbsp; tempting to lapse into utter inactivity.&nbsp; been a zombie today.&nbsp; after the fight, the time just before it becomes completely inconsequential.&nbsp; all this worrying and playing with what ifs is so important now.&nbsp; if i think about every possible outcome then i have more chance of winning.&nbsp; if i do not consider one variation, the surprise might be too much resulting in a loss.&nbsp;   what a load of nonsense.&nbsp;   i must emphasise the fact that the fighting is absolutely worth all of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;  at this juncture let me also inform you that i shall be on isaan (NE) regional TV tomorrow.&nbsp; fortunately my white skin and big rounded eyes have outweighed the fact that i am a bit rubbish at muay thia&nbsp;and made it fitting for me to take the airtime.&nbsp; phi is fighting on the same bill but he will not be getting on the box.&nbsp; he has only had 110 fights and 83 wins.&nbsp; he has only fought at lumpini for a title.&nbsp; he is a thai though and, as such, lacking in my exotic appeal.&nbsp; i am exotic.&nbsp; me.&nbsp; exotic.&nbsp; like a palm tree.  can't wait to write in this blog on friday and let you know how it went.&nbsp; i shall be trying my best to knock my opponent out.&nbsp; this is the first time i have been able to use elbows in a fight and i intend to capitalise on this.&nbsp;   the 13 year old boy next to me has just pulled up a picture of a vagina with eyes and a nose drawn on it.&nbsp; i have signalled my approval.

      na, i'm not gonna write a whole thing about the chickens.&nbsp; they are fucking stupid though.&nbsp; cock-a-gargle-dooing all night.&nbsp; ALL NIGHT LONG&nbsp;(NB: by this i mean that they do not stick to the orthodox once at the break of dawn like on the telly).&nbsp; if they were not fighting chickens i would have to go over there and woop some of them.&nbsp; the warrior in me respects them and their scrawny flee-bitten necks.&nbsp;  &nbsp; my nose hurts today.&nbsp; i box-sparred a japanese fighter called aiwantu nokupeetaowt.&nbsp; he has not read the touchy-feely book of sparring etiquette and i was not feeling confident enough in my japanese to say, "you know we will both learn a lot more if we take it a bit easier, trading combinations and just  knowing  that we can both hit really hard".&nbsp; he came out throwing big single shots trying to knock me down.&nbsp; so instead of the&nbsp;talkytalky option&nbsp;i hit him really hard in the face as many times as i could and gave him a sore nose too.&nbsp; we are now both very happy and looking forward to fighting in 9 days with our sore noses. &nbsp; pa tem, the boss of the gym and general pimpmaster has been sorting out the fight details recently.&nbsp; he came up to me yesterday and poked me in my belly.&nbsp; he said, "you body" and poked me again.&nbsp; it's enough to make a girl self-conscious.&nbsp; i guess losing 3 kilos in a week and a half is not quite fast enough.&nbsp; they are not very strict with weigh-ins when it comes to doddering farang fighters.&nbsp; i am not even sure there will be a weigh in.&nbsp; i will be going in at 'quite big and sweaty'.&nbsp; i am trying to get down to 70 kilos though.&nbsp; the days of fighting at 68k seem far off but i should be in shape after this first&nbsp;fight if not before.&nbsp;  &nbsp; in asia sweetcorn is one of the major foodgroups.&nbsp; i bet you didn't know that. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      dogs in thailand are absolutely mingin.&nbsp; i have never seen a dog with green mould all over it before.&nbsp; at least not one that was walking about.&nbsp; i saw one today.&nbsp; it made me want to yak.&nbsp; it wanted to be my best mate.&nbsp; it was not very fast though. &nbsp; all the dogs are hell bent on humping eachother just now.&nbsp; they do not care whether the other dog is female or not.&nbsp; this has added a new octave to the nightly yelps and howls that would keep me awake if i was not so dog-tired (do you see what i did?) all the time.&nbsp;  &nbsp; dogs in thailand are, to recap, revolting.&nbsp; they are pretty bad during the day,&nbsp;sctratching about and pooping all over the joint.&nbsp; when the sun goes down these lazy tuftballs turn into demons.&nbsp; the two at the bend in our road are particularly mental.&nbsp; they are slightly more dog-looking than most of the mangey mutts but they have pure unadulterated evil at heart and my ankles in their sights.&nbsp; little did they know that i was going to buy a bike aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand a lock.&nbsp; this lock remains in my right fist at night.&nbsp; i am not taking any chances.&nbsp; one wrong move from that brown and white bugger (who shagged the wee dog at my apartment building two nights ago) and he gets smote in the&nbsp;chops by half-centimetre thick wire and plastic.&nbsp;  &nbsp; i have been informed that the government planned to tackle the dog problem.&nbsp; i am not sure whether sasaki (japanese manager of the gym) was trying to say they were gonna de-bollock the dogs or actually kill them, but action was suggested.&nbsp; it has not come to pass because the king of thailand really loves dogs.&nbsp; this is the same king that i and the rest of the audience honoured by standing during the national anthem, played before spiderman 2 (and every movie, ever) started at the cinema in bangkok.&nbsp; he has not been down my street after using the internet at 11pm.&nbsp; he is the king though, so there will be no chopping up of dogs.&nbsp; if i was the king of thailand i would keep the cinema thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;i also wouldn't mind if every building in the country had at least one calendar of pictuers of me on a yacht.&nbsp; i would have a word with the dog situation&nbsp;though.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; and i just remembered, i saw a pig in a bin last week.&nbsp; it was not alive.&nbsp; it looked like it was trying to get out though.&nbsp; this may not quite fit under the remit of dog-chat but it was about as horrible as a thai dog and it is my blog. &nbsp;

      it's thursday night and i have spent all day cycling about like a zombie trying to think of something to do.  i bought a new bike which has a very useful basket on the front.  i am straight though.    decided to take today off training as i was rapidly running myself into the ground over the last three days.  nim nuam has gone mental for the training adding bastardly drills onto the 'end'.  there is more of a group feel and we do pushups in unison as well as stuff like shuttle runs or step-ups onto the ring with hand weights.  youshi is still throwing me around in the clinch with little effort.    it's hard to be objective when you decide to train or not to.  maybe it's just me.  in the back of my mind i feel that i can always do another day training and i woke up ready to go at 6:20 today.  in the front of my mind is the thought that overtraining will not be beneficial and may be detrimental.  fortunately no-one here knows the english for "just train and stop being a poof" so i am taking a day off.  anyway, i think i am on top of it this time and looking forward to training tomorrow.  i am fighting on the 29th.  pretty excited about it and it gives me a good focus for trainin.  i have loads to do but loads of training hours to do it.  i feel very cardio fit but need to work on sustaining the explosive attacking stuff.  there is only one explosive feature that i have mastered in thailand and it is not that useful in the 'ring', if you know what i mean.    being back in ubon is relieving.  there is a great community here around the camp and lots of dirty stories of japanese exploits that occurred in my absence.  i missed having breakfast at the bottom of the road and talking shit with the mad old woman at the apartments.  my new chariot has opened ubon up and now it is mine for the taking.  tesco is no longer a distant dream and the cinema is a laughable 10 minutes away.  if they showed any english language movies that would be cool.  why thais?  why?

      Again I am here and i hate it.  i have had a two beers though. hate is a strong word.  i am pretty much into everything after two beers.  kao san is so cool.  kim is gone and i am turning back towards ubon for another shot at training.  it is ages since i thought about it properly.  iu went to shiang mai and saw sean wright (a guy i used to train with) fighta thai fella.  it was a good ole fight and sean won.  sean and anya were also kind to me and kim and made staying i chiang mai more of a pleasure.    right no more messing about.  it is time to moan again.  some bastard bastard stole my trainers.  yes from right outside our bungalow in ko pah ngan kim's sandels and my running shoes were robbed.  what kind of a filthy thai/farang/local/traveller would do such a thing and why would he/she/it want my smelly trainers?  and whilst we are asking questions, how am i gonna get a super new pair in ubon?    enough whinging.  oh maybe some more.  i miss kim.  ia gonna be lonely.  looking forward to coming home but also relishing the thought of more training in ubon.  i must only stay awake and get to the airport for 6am.  beer should help in this.

      i am having a good time because i have stopped writing for so long.  i am at the beach.  kim and i had a cool time in chiang mai learning to cook thai food (dogs, children) and trekking.  the trek was elephantomatic and bambooraftorific.  we stayed in hill tribe village huts.  the people smiled all the time.  a wee girl of about 3 (or 2 or 5 or 21) came up to welcome me after my weary walk.  she was all giggles and fun and started to put a friendship bracelet on my right wrist.  what a gift!  so damn meaningful and travellrecool.  then she said "fifty baht".  i said "get that thing off my wrist and beat it".  they also had coke.  everywhere in the world sells coca cola.  i am pretty sure that everest has a vending machine at the top.    now we are at the beach in ko pah ngan.  it is gorgeous.  last night we shook off tiredness with red bull (i have no idea what they put in it here but it makes me stronger than ten tigers) to go down to had rin for the full moon party.  world famous they are and i can see why.  big ole party with awful crap music and lots of people on fizzy pop to bad bad drugs and everything in between.  a bit ibiza but a great laugh.  met a lovely couple from dundee.  bog of chops.    this morning i crept out of bed to see if the laundry was done.  jovially asked a buckled-looking girl if she was okay.  she said no.  she had to phone the embassy.  she lost EVERYTHING at the party.  this means, i suppose, that she took everything to the party.  she had a mingin southern english accent and a sulky face.  bounty bungalows is a breath of fresh air.  the people are so trusting and laid-back.  i asled if i should pay on arrival.  they said no, when you leave.  everything we eat there goes in a wee book for our tab.  it is so far removed from the guarded deposit taking that has become necessary in this environment.  it makes me happier than a five star hotel.  five star hotels are very very happy, by the way.  i digress, but for a reason.  the girl asked politely, "i need to ring british embassy!!!!!!!".  the thia lady nodded and made for the phone as she was asked again louder, slower, more rudely.  the girl turned to me and suggested that it was like talking to a fucking brick wall.  i smiled because she had lost her money and passport and credit cards.  i could not help overhearing her belting down the phone that you are MY FUCKING EMBASSY AND YOU ARE MEANT TO HELP ME I HAVE NO MONEY AND I HAVE TO GET HOME.  made me laugh inside and feel sick to death of the brits abroad cliche.  but enough moral highgrounding.    kim has a week here to go as brown as poo before her graduation.  for my part, i will try not to combust.  then it is back to ubon for training.  one last note because i have to moan about this.  i lost my journal.  since about a week ago i have not stopped banging on about how bad that makes me feel.  it is the worst.  maybe i should phone the fucking embassy.  cheerybye.

      Yes, the queen of thailand is 72 and everyone is loving it.  i have heard that if your child is born on this day of days it gets free education for life.  this may be a) a lie or b) the truth.  dunno.  the park was chock-full of thai kids bigging the q up.  two came up to me and asked if i would mind having my picture taken with them.  now i can feel myself falling into 'whitemanstayinasiatoolongnosity' as i did not find this unusual and merely suggested using the big gold doodah as a background.   the newspaper i bought is some interesting reading.  thailand LOVES the queen.  i have also learnt that daimler chrysler and nestle really dig her.  full page adverts in the bangkok post just to say happy birthday.  how kind.  the one for nestle shows queenie holding a wee baby.  she has maybe just fed it some toxic fake milk.  if nestle didn't make such delicious products i would totally boycot their ass.  when she was younger m'lady was poor as jenny from the block.  her da told her not to be ashamed.  i am thinking he maybe also said MARRY THE KING.  both messages heeded.   i trained hard this morning but i could not bring myself to defile her majesty by sweating on the royal afternoon so i tooled about on irish pete's bike with him looking for stuff to do.  needless to say we ate a lot and went to the shops.   every single day shino, my nextdoor neighbour, answers the door wearing the same pair of pants with a toy snake coming out of them.  his face wears a look of genuine surprise.  i think he smokes crack.  he should be on the telly.  in addition, he put a massive blob of superglue on his left foot to remedy the massive torn blister.  that's a new one.  he says it hurts now.  it looked sore too.  and now, a prayer to zinc oxide tape.  shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  i am feeling a bit homesick and really looking forward to all the japes ahead of me at home.  by japes i mean starting a new job.  i've heard jobs are a great laugh.  they'll have to go some to beat pissing about training in a martial art full time.

      if any of you back home are feeling a bit unwell or smash yourself in to a wall or eat a bad egg or something then i suggest you go to stirling royal infirmary and ask for doctor kim rollinson.  mention my name and she can get you morphine or a cast or syringes or a baby.   i know it's a bit out of the way but it's WHO you know.  i need some sleep.  dogs.

      Oh my goodness this is good.  i just remembered it and i can't wait until tomorrow to tell you.  i have been talking to nim nuam of and on learning wee snipits of inside tips for fighting at lumpini.  i glossed over the doing 100 sit-ups, getting smacked in the stomach full force with a thai pad between every one.  oh it  might  work, but i am sceptical.  another tip is to use the laces to pull the stuffing in the glove off the knuckles and round the back.  this leaves a thin layer of leather and some zinc oxide tape between you fist and your opponent's face.  i'll buy that for a dollar.   you can also put some thai oil on the palm of your glove and push it in your opponents face blinding him temporarily.  it's good but it's not right.  but then we started to talk about clinching and we both know that i am not very good at it.  how can you avoid the vice-like grip of an opponent hell-bent on clinching and kneeing you to a pulp?  how?  i will tell you how.  you put KY jelly in your vaseline tub.  this you apply to shoulders, neck and pretty much all over the fighter's body.  yes it is not strictly legal and would result in disqualification.  but imagine trying to get a good hold on someone KYed right up.  not easy, as chris will tell you.  i asked who was the first person to come up with this idea but nim nuam seemed to just say "wasn't me" and change the subject.   imagine sitting in the corner opposite your opponent with a huge tub of KY next to you.

      when i was quite young my brother and i sat down opposite eachother on chairs in his bedroom.  we had a shin-kicking competition.  yes, we sat there taking it in turns to smack eachother in the shin as hard as we could.  i think we had shoes on.  MUAY THAI!!!   the fight and some drinking being over, my mind turned to quick recovery for more training.  ole and sasaki suggested 'grradampon'.  indeed, ole was was kind enough to give me half a bottle advising that i drink it early in the morning and do not go out for 2 hours.  perhaps his danish mind mixed up the english words because i was still weeing out ma bum 5 hours later.  grradampon tastes really really awful.  if you took all the sugar out of cough medicine and put in some hydrochloric acid and some other nasty things you would come pretty close.  drinking it was extremely bad fun.  big mike seems to take issue with the wisdon of taking laxatives after a fight.  but where his mind says "why?", mine simply says "bring it on, thailand".  do i feel better since then?  i dunno.  a bit maybe.   what else is eastern and mysterious is 'brands: essence of chicken'.  now big mike will tell you that it is just chicken stock, but i am reliably informed by my eastern compadres that it makes you strong (also strong in the trouser department according to sasaki).  mike is wrong.  it gives me power.   chat, the massage man has been trying to sort out my knackered shins for me.  he is very good at the massaging.  for very sore bits he uses home made oil.  i asked what was in it.  hot chillis, cloves, oil and BOA CONSTRICTOR BLOOD THAT'S WHAT.  this strikes me as being the most awesome thing ever and the idea itself may be enough to heal my bumped shins.   who am i to question the wisdom of the orient?  who?  noone that's who.  so i will take every single funny smelling concoction going and i will love it.
