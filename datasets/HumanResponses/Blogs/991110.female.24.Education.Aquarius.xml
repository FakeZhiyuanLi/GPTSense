       The other night a friend of mine commented that people often misuse the terms "dork" "nerd" and "geek." I called him a dork, and he said that officially that must make him socially inept. I think he is a dork because he knows when every Harry Potter movie for the next 5 years is coming out and re-reads the Lord of the Rings trilogy every year. Though, I wouldn't say he is at all inept. But he's right, officially those words mean some form of social or intellectual ineptness.  In any case, last night we all went bowling. By "we all" I mean my dorky friend mentioned above and another dorky, but not as dorky, friend. I mean in grad school we are all kind of dorky really. "Super cool" and "grad student" don't mix very well. After a couple of games of bowling (where I of course lost but continually improved my own game) an undergraduate couple showed up. (They were clearly undergrads and I think clearly freshman. If we weren't at the Cornell Lanes, I might have even suspected they were Sr's in high school). In any case, these kids were nerds, and I mean that in the proper sense. At first I found them amusing. The girl with her colorful print shorts, that sort of looked like she sewed them in Home Ec class, the guy with his thick glasses and pants a little to high, the girl's attempt at a "sexy dance" as she came back from bowling a frame to the music on the juke box, the things they would say to each other after the got a strike or a spare. The whole shebang was amusing to me.   Which I know makes me a bad person. I never claimed to be a particularly good person. I'm a nice person, whose nice to people, but I'm also the kind of person who enjoys gossiping and pointing out the foibles of others be they friend or foe. And yes, I know glass house and all that. I shouldn't be throwing stones considering that I am no where near perfect, and I have enough character flaws of my own to keep people like me talking about me.   And yeah, these kids were really nerdy (Their nerdiness was lighyears ahead of my too-cool-for-the-cool-kids, don't blame me I'm a grad student dorkiness), but they were incredibly happy. And yeah, I found it amusing that when they would highfive they would lock fingers for a second or stop in the middle of bowling to give each other a hug. But at least they had someone to lock fingers with in a bowling alley. I was there with two guys who I won't be locking fingers with at bowling alleys any time soon (nor would I have any desire too), and in fact I haven't had someone to be that happy with in quite awhile. So be it, that they are socially awkward people, at least they have each other and that's really all the counts.  So who am I to judge them, and call them nerds, and make fun of their homemade shorts? Can't I just put away my single jadedness and let these kids be happy in peace? Eh, what fun is that?  urlLink  postCount('108338121447754194');

       Last night I called one of my credit card companies to cancel one of my credit cards. I have too many cards, and too much credit for my income. Since a car loan is hopefully in my future, I thought it would be smart to cut some of my excess credit baggage. Besides, once the card is cancelled I can't be enticed to use it anymore. I had once nearly cancelled my Verizon Visa, only to put a $2700 computer purchase on it a few weeks later.  In any case, calling to cancel a credit card is not an easy task. I've tried before (sometimes just as a trick to get them to lower my APR) and it usually ends with them spending 5 to 10 minutes coming up with ways to get me to keep my card. Before that though I have to spend 5 to 10 minutes of navigating through their menu-option puzzle, listening to every option before I get the "speak to a real person" option, and then waiting on hold to speak to said person. This company was no different. The twist, though, which almost made me want to keep my card, was that instead of waiting for a "customer service representative" I was waiting for a "relationship counselor." Yes, that is correct, a relationship counselor.  I was waiting for something along the lines of.. "Yes ma'm I have your account here in front of me. It shows here that you have been single for 1 1/2 years, is that correct?" "Yes that's correct." "And let's see, your last romantic encounter was last June? Is that correct?" "Yes that is correct." "Uh Huh. I see here that you went dancing last Saturday. A guy asked you to dance with him, and you turned him down, is that correct." "Yes but he wanted his friend to dance with my friend. His friend was wearing a vest. I wasn't going to make her dance with a guy in a vest." "Okay, Ma'm. Well it also looks like your friends told you to "flirt" with one of their friends." "Yeah they did. I tried. I guess I'm not a good flirt." "Mmhm, I see. Well, it looks like you don't have many transactions here. How often do you go out and meet people?" "Well, I go out, but I don't meet people." "Yes uh huh, well that's the problem ma'm. Now I can offer you this date protection plan..."  You get the idea. Instead I got...  "Alright, well we are sorry to lose your buisiness but I will go ahead and cancel your account for you."  And that was that. They didn't even try to offer me a low balance transfer rate or anything. Just, sure thing, we'll cancel your credit card. Quick, easy, and I was dumped. That's a relationship counselor for you.  urlLink  postCount('108311688776878741');

       My three siblings and are three very different people. I was talking to my mom and commented, "I got the brains, Meggen got the brawns, and Drew got the personality. If you put us all together you'd have a superhuman." My mom agreed. Unfortunatley, my parent's superhuman genes got split up amongst the three of us. I wonder though, since we had to split it up who got the best deal in the end?  I'm the brains of the family. In actuality, I'm the brains of my entire extended family. I'm not actually very sure where I got these brains from. Looking at everyone else you would really have to wonder. Not to say anything bad about my family. They are good people, just not thinking people.  In any case, I'm not sure how beneficial getting the brains are. Being a braniac, I chose an academic career. Given the amount of time we spend in school, we really don't make the big bucks. Besides, being book smart doesn't get you so far. I'm not a complete personal retard, but I definately don't have the people skills some others do. I'm an awful networker, which is, I suppose, why I chose to become and academic rather than say, a lawyer. Plus I ablosultely suck at doing anything with my hands. Chopping vegitables, threading needles, doing pushups, driving while talking on my cell phone, building shelves. Pretty much anything like that. But I can think about stuff, which I suppose is good.  My sister, she got the brawns. Seriously. If she wanted to, she could probably be a female body builder. When she was in 7th grade she wanted to prove to the boys in her gym class how strong she was, so she did 300 pound leg presses. She could run fast and beat up any boy. I am sure she would have had a good athletic career, except for the fact that she hates organized activities so she was never any good at joining sports. Along with her brawns comes mechanical ability. Unlike me she's really good at doing stuff with her hands. When she was 4, she got a tool set complete with hammer and saw. I think she built a stool, that was actually pretty sturdy. Of course my sister lacks the book smarts. She hates playing games, like Trivial Pursuit or Tribond, with my family because "her peice never moves." And peoplewise, she's pretty likable, but she seriously a hothead. If you run into her, stay on her good side. She probably won't punch you in the face or anything, but she'll definately get mad. Right now she works as a tech in the airforce. Its probably a good career for a girl who is brawny and has mechanical skills.  My brother, he's Mr. Personality. He was recently voted by his highschool Sr. class as having the best personality in the class. He's also class president which at his high school (which used to be my high school) is completely a popularity contest. He's nice to everyone. He never gets angry or upset. He has the patience of a preschool teacher. He's funny a witty, and plays guitar and listens to cool music. He's unfortunately lazy as sin. Although he is smart, he completely lacks the motivation or attention to excell academically. He doesn't do poorly, but he's very left brain and would rather be doodling than taking notes.   So who got the best deal of the 3 of us? My vote is on my brother. While he is a lazy ass, having people like you gets you the furthest in life. Of course the three of us together would probably make the best team. I can think it up, my sister can build it, and my brother will make you like it. Of course, since we're not a family of crazy inventors, we will probably just end up being 3 very different people from the same family.  urlLink  postCount('108270125744546073');

       Seriously. I'm not sure whats wrong with me. For the past 2 or 3 weeks I have been wholly unable to fall asleep at a normal time. Despite forcing myself to wake up at a normal early (by my standards) time, I have not been able to get on a regular sleep schedule. Its quite frustrating. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. But I can't. I've tried reducing my caffine, tried doing a PM strech routine, triedall sorts of stuff and nothing seems to work.  Perhaps I am stressed. I don't feel particularly stressed. I mean I do have a master's thesis that I am supposed to finish by August.  And I am working on 4 other projects for my research assistantship. I'm not quite sure what my summer deal is yet or how much money I will make. I have class presentation due this week. I am single and I hate it. I'm going to buy a new car. I want to lose 5 pounds but I can't seem to get my self motivated enough to diet. My current car sucks and I am afraid will break soon.  But seriously, I'm not stressed.  Maybe I am. I don't know. Tonight I was convinced that I was going to fall asleep. I was almost there and then I thought about how Jennifer Hudson TOTALLY should not have been voted off  urlLink  American Idol   since she clearly was the best singer in the whole competition and then I was bothered and couldn't sleep. If stupid  American Idol  is all I have to keep me awake at night then I should be doing alight.  But I'm not.   urlLink  postCount('108261359831918338');

       Yesterday, I overheard a couple of undergads talking. One was telling the other that she was wearing red and white that day out of protest (or maybe it was solidarity something along those lines). Apparently, there was a "very offensive" article in the  urlLink  Cornell Review  . She hadn't read the article, but had only heard about it. She thought that it was racist (though she wasn't sure) or something like that. Some students had staged a sit-in on the quad regarding this article. She was lamenting that she missed the sit-in. But, the sit-in organizers had also apprently urged students to wear red and white in protest to the article. Again she had not read the article.  That really bothered me. Its one thing to read something be offended by it and take action. Its another to take action because someone tells you to. Mindless activism is a bit of an oxymoron. Activism, by definition is active. Simply doing something because someone else tells you to or because it seems to be the "in" thing to do, is not activism in my book. Maybe that's just my book.   This was a constant problem during my undergrad. Students would join the students for social justice (SSJ) and protest everything under the sun, without any real understanding of what they were protesting. Once, my sophomore year, there was a group of students in the dining hall who asked me to sign their petition to asking the federal government to create a regulation requiring food manufacturers to put lables on genetically modified food. Someone approached the table the same time I did. She asked what this was all about. The long haired hippy guy responded "Because we don't want THEM fucking with our FOOD!!" The girl signed the petition. That wasn't a good enough answer for me. I mean, yeah food manufacturers are always fucking with our food. Pasturization is fucking with our milk, but I don't see anyone starting petitions against pasturization. I'm quite happy they invented it. Needless to say, I didn't sign their petition.  Its okay to be passionate about something, but you have to know what you are talking about. And you have to think through your activism all the way. Just saying X is bad isn't enough. You have to think of real reasons of how you can change X. Another example from the SSJ highlights this. For at least 2 years they protested the Taliban. They would dress up in Burquas and walk around campus handing out anti-Taliban pamphlets. The U.S. should do something about the Taliban and the awful way they treat women. So, when the U.S. finally goes and uses military action to take down the Taliban, what do the SSJ do? They had a sit-in on the quad. When they were protesting the Taliban, what did they really expect the U.S. to do?  Don't be an activist for the sake of being an activist. Know a little bit about what you are protesting. Do research on your own. If you want to wear red and white in protest of a supposedly racist article in the Conservative student newspaper, go for it. But for God's sake, read the article.  urlLink  postCount('108224423939077093');

       There isn't a lot of good stuff on network TV these days. Especially not good sitcoms. During the 1980's and 90's sitcoms were networks' bread and butter.  Seinfeld, Cheers, Rosanne, Murphy Brown, Family Ties, The Golden Girls, The Cosby Show , etc. all started and ended their runs during these two decades. (I know that  The Golden Girls  is no  Seinfeld , but its a damn funny show). Today, network television swimming in a mire of reality programming. I know there is a hook to these shows, and the "classics" (if there can be a classic in this genre) such as Survivor and American Idol still remain, for the most part worth watching. (At least I watch them, I don't know if that actually makes them worth it). I know everyone loves  The Apprentice , but I refused to watch. The Donald just doesn't do it for me. In addition you have  The Swan, Average Joe, The Bachelor, Extreme Makeover, Extreme Home Makeover, Fear Factor, Forever Eden, Joe Millionaire, Who Wants to Marry My Dad , and so on and so forth.   If reality programming weren't bad enough, the rest of network TV is simply dismal.  Friends  is still okay, but the past couple seasons have just been a big schmoltzy love-fest that lacks the real comedy before the Monica-Chandler wedding of the century. Besides, in May it will be off the air for good.  Everybody Loves Raymond  is still alright, though all the other CBS Raymond wannabes aren't so great, and besides IT will be off the air next year too. When it comes to sitcoms it seems networks just aren't trying anymore.  Except Fox. I never thought the network that brought us year after year (after year) of Married With Children could be such a oasis of sane TV. Granted Fox also has some of the most outrageous reality shows (e.g. they invented "Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire") but at the same time being a network willing to take risks has paid off. Most notably, their new program  Arrested Development , is by far the best show on network television.  If you haven't seen Arrested Development yet, watch it! (9:30 pm, after Malcom in the Middle). Its one of the most clever, fresh, and unusual comedies that have come along in awhile. While many have compared AD to Seinfeld, I think the best comparison is to the late 70's/early 80's ABC Comedy  urlLink Soap . Both shows are wacky, smart, innovative, and involve messed up wealthy families. Soap lasted only 4 years, but ran its course well in those years. It also launched the career of Billy Crystal. Arrested Development probably won't launch any careers (the cast includes many well-established actors including David Cross and Portia de Rossi) but I hope it lasts at least 4 more years. (Unlike the Bush presidency...sorry for the political sidebar, but you can't hear "4 more years" and not think presidential elections.)  There's talk that despite AD's critical acclaim (for example  urlLink  Time  named it the "Best American Sitcom of 2003"), it may not be returning for a second season. I desperately hope this isn't true. This show has the potential to save network TV from falling into an abyss of sensational reality programming.   If you happen to care as much about TV as I do, you can sign  urlLink this petition  to keep AD on the air. Also check out  urlLink  USA Today's Save our Shows  page.   This show is so good. It should be no wonder that creator Mitchell Hurwitz got his start as a writer/producer for the  Golden Girls .  urlLink  postCount('108209296604804907');

       I love baseball season. I think baseball is the greatest sport ever. Americans are smart for inventing it. Unfortunately I don't get as much enjoyment out of baseball as I should. This is because I am a Cleveland Indians fan.  Recently, ESPN.com posted an article about the  urlLink MLB Misery Index . The misery index is a 60 point system that measures two types of fan misery: despair and pain. Despair is caused by losing seasons, pain is caused by having an excellent winning season only to be sorely disappointed in the post-season. And my team, gotta love 'em, are number 2 on the Misery index.  We have historic despair. The Cleveland Indains were so bad, that they made a series of movies making fun of how bad they were (Those would be the major league movies with Charlie Sheen in case you are not up on your funny baseball movies). They were so bad, that they would give out tickets for free. You'd come out from the grocery store and there on your windshield were a couple of tickets to the Cleveland Indians. In fact, word had it that their stadium at the time (Cleveland Municipal Stadium, that was shared with the Cleveland Browns) had a gypsy curse placed on it.   Luckily for me, most of that despair occurred before I really started enjoying baseball. My interest in baseball began around 1994 (the year of the strike and the year Cleveland got a new, supposedly curse-free, stadium) and Cleveland was actually good. Which leads to the pain.   I DID experience pain with my team. 1995 wasn't so bad. Even though they lost the world series, after years and years and years of sucking, it was nice just to be there. 1997 was painful. It was bad enough for me to watch my team come within 3 outs of winning the world series only to be blown by Jose Mesa's grotesque closing pitching ( I later referred to him as Jose Mess-up, and once made a sign that I held up at Jacobs Field reading "Mesa Sucks"). It was really bad for my dad. He's spent his whole life as an Indians fan, through years and years of dispair he then gets shot through the heart with searing pain. Its sad really.  1998 and 1999 were not so bad seasons, though the loss to Boston in the playoffs was quite distressing, and I agreed with the decision that Mike Hargrove should get the boot. And then, new owners and new GM. They decide they need to rebuild the team. Why do you need to rebuild a team that has Jim Thome, Manny Ramierez, David Justice, Robbie Alomar, Omar Viszquel, and Kenny Lofton? Not so sure, but they apparently thought it was a good idea to trade all their good players for prospects and now...more dispair.  Currently, my Cleveland Indains are in last place in the AL Central. This is the same division that is home to the Detroit Tigers. Granted its only the first week or so of baseball, but I think it speaks of things to come. We are in store for 40 some odd years of despair to be topped off by 7 or 8 years of pain. Oh the misery!  urlLink  postCount('108197838111104935');

       If I were going to marry a website that website would be amazon.com. I think its the most amazing website ever created. I know that as a general rule people like amazon.com. Recently,  Time  placed amazon's look inside the book feature as one of the top inventions of the year (after  urlLink Apple Computer's  iTunes music store). But I don't think these other people have such a strong affection to amazon.com the way I do.   I wish all websites could be amazon.com. They are the smartest marketers out there. I don't know how they do it, but every time I visit they say "Hello Sarah, we have recommendations for you," and what do you know? Their recommendations are almost always right. Amazon.com introduced me to some very wonderful bands. I discovered Neutral Milk Hotel, Iron and Wine, The Decemberists, and Sondre Lerche through Amazon.com's recomendations. I almost always buy my CDs from amazon.com even if I can find them cheaper elsewhere, just because I love the company so much I WANT to give them my money.  In addition to making shopping a pleasure, amazon.com is great for procastination. I love wish lists. I think your amazon.com wish list really says a lot about you as a person. Mine says I like to have stuff. Currently there are 125 items on my wish list. I sort of have a shopping problem, and a lack of money problem. Being able to add things to my wish cures my shopping bug without causing undo financial harm. To make wish lists even better, amazon.com has the comments function. I've added a comment to about 90% of the items on my wish list. I thought that it would be nice if you could put your wish list in order of how much you wanted something. I emailed this concern to amazon.com. Now, I'm not saying its entirely because of me, but now you can give each item on your list a priority and sort lists by priority.  If wish lists were not enough for the bored, procrastinating, person like myself, you also have the ability just to make lists. Just lists for fun. I have a list of movies I would play if I owned a cable movie channel and a list of CDs I would bring if I were trapped on a desert island. There's not real purpose to these lists. They are just there to waste my time, and man oh man do I love 'em for it.  Everyone has been heralding their search inside the book feature. I have to admit it's been pretty nice. Occassionally I've been writing a paper and I realize I just need one more citation to prove my point. Instead of going to the library and trying to find a book that will work, I can amazon.com it. If its a minor citation I can get enough info just from the website to use in my paper. I've also been able to really check if a citation I found through a literature search eingine will really help me out. In short its great.  Yes. Amazon.com I love you. You can get anything from amazon.com. They are cheap. They have free shipping. They have nice customer service. They understand my need to procrastinate and my desire to go shopping without spending money. They are brilliant.    urlLink  WHISHLIST!   urlLink  postCount('108188689076107775');

       I'm not a lush. Seriously, I'm not. Now that I'm in grad school I go out maybe 2 or 3 weekends a month. And often, going out involves visiting the classy bar/restaraunt type places drinking a single glass of Dry Riesling or White Zinfandel and heading home. There's no prepartying, or frat parties, or any of that glorious undergrad drinking behavior. And yet, I still remain the queen of bad drinking decisions.  So far we've only had 3 fairly big parties in our department this year (not counting my birthday party, as I was the hostess, being sloshed was not an option. I was too worried about our clogged toilet and guests showing up early and every other mini drama to drink too much.) And so far, every party has ended with me being escorted home with much concern by more sober others. There are people in our department who go out way more often and drink a lot more than I do, but I don't think they are gaining the reputation of "department ridicuous drunk girl." I'm afraid that might be slowly becoming me.  How do I always end up passed out on the floor of the host's bedroom or underneath a pile of guest's coats? Do I completely lack self control? Do I have the wimpiest tolerance in the world? Am I so socially awkward that I'm afraid I can't have a good time without being inebriated? I have to say its none of the above. I end up this way because I am the most competetive person I know. How does competetiveness equal drunken debauchary, you may ask?  This is partly because I also have been labouring for about the past 8 years or so that I can drink a lot more alcohol than I actually can, and believe that I am a master chugger. I cannot turn down a drinking competition or a chugging challenge.   Last night after 3 fairly strong rum & cokes I was about to call it an evening. I think i even had my jacket on and was heading out the door. And then, someone challenged me to a beer chugging contest. By the way, I never drink beer (which always comes as a shock to everyone who knows me). This was probably the 3 beer I've ever drunk in my life. But I decided to take the challenge. Much to my dissapointment, I lost (though the girl who defeated me also won a guinness chiugging contest against a much bigger guy, so I think she's just a master beer chugger).  Then, I suppose to defend my honor or something, I was challenged to a tequilla drinking contest. That one was called a tie, though I think I won. Considering that my challenger was a guy, and had not just finished a beer chugging contest I think I should have been granted the win if it were too close to call.  Needless to say, I spent much of this morning on the bathroom floor and the rest of the day in bed. I was convinced for awhile that perhaps I had caught the flu. It was just a coincidence that I happened to be very much hurting the day after I had made more than a few bad drinking decisions. It probably wasn't the flu.  I don't know why I always do this. Maybe because I actually go to these sorts of parties so rarely that I've already forgotten the misery that ensues afterwards. There should be some conditioning taking place here that would lead me to stop chugging contests. And yet, sadly, I don't think I will. As my friend here often says "As  urlLink  Mason Verger  says in  Hannibal  'It seemed like a good idea at the time.'"  urlLink  postCount('108166143007885167');

       I'll appologize in advance for spending two whole days talking about Jesus. But something really important related to Jesus people struck me today, and I really think I need to share. Well, not really important, but important enough for my blog.  So Jesus people have always creeped me out some. I think its why I really don't like Christianity so much, especially compared to other religions. I think Jewish people are great. In fact, I've decided that dating Jewish guys will be my new schitck. The creepy Christian phenomenon also probably has something to do with why I find Jesus so funny. I had some difficulty putting my finger on exactly what is so creepy about them, though (it wasn't JUST that they wear jewlery depicting a man nailed to a Roman torture device, though that  is  pretty creepy when you think about it).  I finally figured it out today. Jesus people have really, really bad social skills. I mean they are nice and all, usually a little TOO nice but  they really don't get the normal social cues that most people pick up on.  I have a roommate that is a good example of this. I think she's alright, despite her Jesusness, though there are some annoying things about her. Some of my friends though really don't like her. She's completely, 100% clueless to this. Despite the fact that they give her obvioius "I don't like you" cues (like never inviting her to do things, never engaging her in conversation, and EVEN telling her they don't like her) she just simply doesn't get it. She also talks REALLY loudly at inappropriate times, like on the bus, and doesn't catch on that people are giving her the "OMIGOD will you shut up" look. And I think she's just a mild case of the Jesus-Social-Akwardness problem.  She has this friend that I think is totally creepy. I won't name names, just in case the guy ever stumbles onto my blog, but he's a real creep-out sort of guy. I mean is really, really, really nice. Nice to the point that something's gotta be wrong with him. If you've ever seen  urlLink  Cannibal the Musical  this guy is totally Isreal Swan. Okay, so being really nice I can kind of deal with, though it does sort of creep me out. The other problem, though, is this guy just does not pick up on subtle social cues. Like he'll be talking to me and I'm watching TV, and I really don't like him much but I do really like  Seinfeld  or whatever it is I am watching. So I don't make eye contact, I give the shortest answers possible, don't engage in the conversation. Still he keeps right on talking to me. He's been coming over more and more lately, often uninvited. Now, he'll come over at like 11:30 or 12:00. I'll have my door shut, lights off, in bed reading or something and he's knocking on my damn door. "I've got ICECREAM!!" Seriously. That actually happened. Who comes over to someone's house and knocks on their roommate's door late at night when the roommate may be sleeping? Does he not understand that door closed = please don't bother me unless its important? Even today, I think my roommate is getting annoyed. He came over to make dinner with her, and really I could sense she was annoyed with him. Normal people pick up on these sort of things. He was totally clueless. I found it really amusing to watch.  I'm not sure why Jesus people tend to be like this. Maybe because of their lack of social skills they're unable to make friends, except in the church where everyone is everyone's friend, and everyone's friends with Jesus. I don't know. But there's definitely something with them. That's why I don't get mixed up with those Jesus types.  urlLink  postCount('108147326378538144');

       The other day a group of us grad students were meeting to help another fellow grad student edit one of her papers for publication. This is the sort of things grad students do in their free time, as we are all hopelessly dorky. In any case someone made the comment that she should change her wording to make it sound less like she knew everything there was to know, since she wasn't God. Then I said, "Wouldn't it be funny to add Jesus as your coathor?" I can picture now, my name, my advisors name, and then "Jesus H. Christ." He would be third author of course. As funny as it was, I started to think that actually yeah, I can imagine someone really adding Jesus as their co-author. I mean, the guidelines for authorship in scientific papers is that the author has made a "substantial contribution" to the work. People will add their advisors as junior authors on papers "just because," even if the advisor really didn't do anything on the project. And really, when you think about it, isn't Jesus the ultimate advisor? At least if you believe in that sort of thing.  Which I don't. In fact, I think Jesus is about the funniest thing out there. I'm not sure how I developed my anti-Jesus attitude. I suppose it has something to do with attending an "elite" liberal arts college. People are pretty anti-Jesus in academia. However, its not just that I'm not a fan of religion. I do think that religion has real merit, and I can definitely see the psychological reasons why people follow religions. I try to be respectful of other people's religious beliefs even if I don't agree. At least respectful to their face. When my roommate goes to her weekly fellowship meetings I do disrespectfully refer to them as her "Jesus Meetings," but I am sure never to do that when she is in earshot. I don't think Jesus is funny, as I know others do, because there are so many people out there that blindly follow him (er Him) without any real reason. Being cynical about religion is one thing, but for me there's just something that has become intrinsically comical about the ol' JC. You just say the word "Jesus" around me and I crack a smile. I own a Jesus porcelin night-light. I used to own a "I love Jesus" air freshiner, and dubbed my old beater car (even older and beatier than my current ride) the "Jesus Mobile." When my friends from home send me Jesus related forwards (being from Ohio and never attending college, they tend to be big fans of Jesus related emails) I laugh and delete them, or occassionally forward them to other anti-Jesus people for the comic value. I'm not sure how Jesus has become a comedy device in my life, but he has and I suppose if you are a Christian then, yeah that's kind of sad. It does make me sort of sad that a religious icon has become just as funny to me as poop.   Maybe I will make Jesus my coauthor on my next paper, just to make up for all my previous anti-Jesus ways. If it turns out that the millions (or BILLIONS) of Christians are right, Jesus might appreciate this gesture and not send me to the firery furnaces of hell. He really hasn't written much in awhile,  I think he might like to improve his publication record.  urlLink  postCount('108139884523736470');

       I finally received an email back from Gary Ross, Colgate's dean of admissions. I emailed a week ago after I found out that my brother's friend did not get into Colgate. I was literally shocked by the school's decision to deny him. I could maybe see if they admitted him but did not offer financial aid, or even possibly if he were waitlisted. But the fact that he was completely denied outright made no sense to me. He has a 4.0 GPA on a 4-pt scale, a 30 on his ACTs (we Midwesterners don’t take the SATs), played 2 varsity sports, is a member of National Honor Society, etc. Now, I understand that college admissions are increasingly more competitive, but his academic record is very impeccable. The only reason for not admitting him is looking at his overall extra curricular record and deciding that he is clearly a good student, but not necessarily "exceptional."   Now, he might not be an exceptional student if he were coming from a private school or even a good public school system. But given the economic and academic background of my hometown, he is actually an incredibly exceptional student. That is, when you consider his achievements in the context of his background, he should shoot up to the exceptional student status. This is generally the argument in favor of affirmative action programs. Sure, admissions counselors will argue, some of minority students admitted to top colleges are lacking on objective measures of achievement, however when considered in the context of their background the achievements are quite note-worthy. Because the student was born a member of a disadvantaged racial or ethnic group, objective measures of his achievement do not necessarily capture the full range of his ability. Therefore, race should be considered when deciding whether or not to admit an applicant.  I'll buy that argument. The problem I have is that race alone is not the only measure of disadvantage. Economic status is also an important measure of disadvantage (and in my opinion even more so). A student from an economically poor background should be given the same sort of special consideration that other minority students are given in college admissions processes. However, based on an (albeit very small) sample with this particular student, it appears that economic background is not considered as a special circumstance.  Gary Ross tried to argue two things in his email response to me. First, he highlighted the "strength of the accepted students" this year. Average GPA 4.0, mid 50% ACT scores 30-33. Throwing these numbers at me does absolutely nothing to quell my concern over this situation, considering that the student in question is well within these numbers and thus should have been considered academically strong. He also tried to point out that no, indeed, Colgate DOES accept poor kids. Why…this year alone they accepted 200 students who parents make under $40K a year. My response to this is that 1). Of course I know they accept poor students, considering that I was a poor kid accepted to their school. 2). These 200 students represent roughly 9.5% of the students accepted. Racial minorities represent 24% of the accepted class. While I am sure financial aid dollars prohibit nearly a quarter of the student body to be in this income bracket, these numbers are hardly comparable. Furthermore, given the unfortunate situation in our country where racial minorities are more likely to be economically disadvantaged I would argue that there is much overlap between the 9.5% and the 24%. If I had to guess, the proportion of poor, white, males would probably be 1-2% of the admitted class. Furthermore, spouting off numbers does not provide any insight into the admissions procedures. One charge against affirmative action programs is that entering minority students have lower objective measures of achievement, though as admissions professionals will argue these lower objective measures do not necessarily represent lower ability. Of course there are smart, high achieving economically disadvantaged students. However, the question that is still not answered is if these economically disadvantaged kids are considered in light of this adversity, and thus would tend to have lower objective measures.  That's enough of that tirade. My mom just called me and told me brother did not get into Ithaca College which was his first choice school. I think, based on their student profile, that he should have gotten in. I'm happy I’m not applying to college again this year, obviously it's a really crazy year for admissions.  urlLink  postCount('108119943290798808');

       I seriously hate daylight savings time. Seriously. The first Sunday in April is my least favorite day of the year. Even if I do get to eat peeps and chocolate bunnies it sucks. I really enjoy my sleep. REALLY. My whole life is being structured around my ability to sleep as much as humanly possible. Its my whole reason for going to grad school and persuing an academic career. In grad school, for the most part, I can maintain a college-like sleeping schedule and wake up around 10 am every day. Once I am a professor, I'll only teach afternoon classes. I'm not sure if I want to have kids ever. Kids require waking up in the morning, babies require waking up at night.   Loosing an hour of sleep is a precious loss for me. It takes me days to get back on track. Since it happens on Sunday I sleep in and wake up like I normally would. That led to me waking up this "morning" at 12:35 pm. Which explains why I am still up after 1 am. The unfortunate part will be tomorrow when I need to wake up at my normal time. There is a big difference to my body between 8:30 and 9:30. My body is going to think its 8:30 when my alarm goes off and it won't be happy.  Not only does loosing an hour of sleep suck it hard core, but the whole evening hour of light throws me off completely. I almost missed watching the Simpsons (and the rest of Fox's brilliant Sunday night line-up) because I was working away at my computer and had no idea it was nearing prime-time television viewing. It was still light outside for Pete's sake. Luckily I happened to glance at my clock at 7:45 and made it in time. Unfortunately, the first Simpson's episode and Malcom in the Middle were reuns. But there was a new Arrested Development (the best new show on TV!) so it was all worth it. However, I digress. I was talking about why today sucks.  And if stupid national energy-saving time change laws weren't enough to make today sucktacular to the maximus, mother nature has decided to take a crap on us. Figuratively of course. Its the beginning of April and we practically have a blizzard brewing outside. Snow, cold, and wind. Hurray! What a lovely way to enjoy the extra hour of light we got this evening.  urlLink  postCount('108114222658293367');

       So word on the street is that my younger sister got married today. Its so bizaare that I don't even know the particulars of this supposed blessed event. She calls me from Japan like 3 weeks ago and says that she's getting married to her boyfriend. Last thing I heard before that was they were broken up because of some ex-fiance of his. Needless to say, my mom flipped when she heard the news. I was surprised but not completely shocked. The one thing I know about my sister is that she is wholly irrational. The second thing I know about my sister is that when she gets an idea in her head it stays stuck there. You can't talk her out of it for anything. When she was a kid she was fixated on owning hampsters. She begged my parents for a hampster. Finally they let her have one. When it got out of its cage and crawled into our heating ducts and died, she asked for another. This happened more than once. When my dad redid our heating he found multiple hampster carcasses in the system. I don't know what this says about my sister's marriage, but its gotta say something.  In related news, I'm having a baby shower tomorrow for another grad student in my department. Yesterday another student told me she was expecting. A few weeks ago a friend from highschool called me to tell me she was expecting (again). My best friend just bought a condo and lives there with her boyfriend. Luckily she's not having any babies. All of this marrying and babies and buying houses seriously makes me feel old. Well, more than old, it makes me feel inadequate. I'm  hopelessly  single. I live in a house with two roommates in a college town. I drive a beat-up car my parents so nicely gave me 2 years ago. They still pay my car insurance. I'm still in school (albeit grad school) with no chance of having a real job for at least 3 more years. And no chance for a real car, a real house, or a real relationship while I'm at it. I feel like at 24 that shouldn't be problematic. But when everyone around you seems to be growing up, and your still stuck feeling like your a junior in college (or better yet a sophomore) you start to wonder if something isn't wrong.   I think I will conclude that no, nothing is wrong with me. Psychologists now suggest that adolescents lasts until you are 30. I'll take my time to grow up, and all those people having babies and getting married are just jumping the gun and not enjoying their youth. At least I'm old enough to know that if I had a baby (or a husband) I'd probably end up loosing him in a heating duct.  urlLink  postCount('108097317013613242');

       I know that it is very cliche to whine about people who talk on their cell phone in public. Its like a bad Seinfield routine, "What's the deal with cell phone users? Are you SO important that..." Its not even worth finishing the sentence. So, part of me is saying not to make my first post all about cell phone users, since it really is pretty much the epitome of passe. Like the sort of thing you talk about when you think you are being funny/clever/witty/etc. when in reality you are anything but. Since I am fully aware that I am none of the above, I'm just going to go ahead and do it.  It seriously amazes me, literally AMAZES me that some people do not realize how abosolutely annoying it is to force other people to listen to your conversations on cell phones. I live in a college town. People really aren't that important here. I can't imagine that their calls cannot wait. And yet they don't wait. The phenomenon of bus-cell phone talkers is ridiculous. Today, for example, this girl is on her phone, going on and on about how her boyfriend will spend $1000 on her one week and then the next won't even spend $20, and how he gets drunk so easily. I picked up on all this while I had my headphones on. Luckily for me, I could crant the volume up on the ol' iPod. The passenger sitting next to her had no such luck. It was obvious to anyone that she was REALLY annoyed, anyone I suppose except the perpetrator.  I've experienced worse though. A few weeks ago, I was, again, on the bus when the woman sitting  behind me decided to make a call. Normally that's annoying enough. But, I suppose she felt bad for the person sitting next to her so she decided to lean forward in her seat, I guess so she wasn't yapping in this guys ear. Literally, though, the woman was talking right into my neck. She was speaking Chinese or Korean or something, so I didn't have the benefit on at least eaves dropping on an interesting conversation. Even if she were telling the juciest story, I don't think it would have been worth it. Ick, I can still feel her breath on my neck. That's a really gross feeling.  I won't belabor this subject anymore, I think I've given it as much space as it deserves.  urlLink  postCount('108086595512967989');

       I just watched the finale of   urlLink American Idol   tonight. I was really into the show. Its so weird that I really enjoy the show a lot and really care about who wins (for the record I think Fantasia should have won, though really I thought that Jennifer and LaToya should have been in the final 2), given that I hate pop music. Occassionally, I'll let a song get stuck in my head, like that No Doubt song, but as a general rule I don't listen to pop music. Don't buy pop albums, don't listen to Top 40 radio, don't watch MTV. In the words of a dear friend of mine, "I don't listen to main stream music."  This sentiment, that I don't listen to main stream music, is currently causing a condundrum in my life and the life of my equally musically snobbish friends (alright they are probably bigger music snobs than me). These days, a lot of previously obscure indie bands are starting to make it big. Previously relegated to college stations and public radio like  urlLink KEXP , indie bands are hitting it big. I realized this most markedly when I saw the line-up for Lollapalooza this year. Acts include: Modest Mouse, Le Tigre, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, The Walkmen, and The Polyphonic Spree, not mention old staples like Morrisey, The Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Wilco. Three years ago there was talk about brining Le Tigre to Spring Party Weekend, now they are playing the Lollapalooza tour.   I have mixed emotions when bands I like start to hit it big. We played The White Stripes on a radioshow about 2 months before they hit it really big. I thought they were pretty rockin. As soon as I saw their video on MTV I decided I couldn't like them. Despite the fact that I have enjoyed every White Stripes song I have ever heard, I have yet to buy an album. Is it really that big of a deal that Jack White dates Rene Zelweger? For some reason, yeah it is.  The conudrum comes from two competeting human desires. We desire beauty and we desire status. When art (including music) was first introduced to society, only those with status could obtain it. Beauty and status went hand in hand. As the lower classes became more affluent, and manufacturing cheaper and easier, beauty became accessable to the masses. Anyone could buy a recording of the symphony or a painting of a beautiful sunset. So, those seeking status had to look elsewhere. In visual arts this has led to modern art, where the peices are wholly theoretical. If the average man looks at a piece of modern art and says "What the hell, I could do that crap," but the eltitist art snob understands that the painting of white lines on a white canvas is an exploration of space, dimension, and the reality that there is no single entity of "white" then the elitist art snob wins. Their art is not accessable to the masses and they are able to maintain their status.   I'm not really compairing indie music to modern art. While modern art can be quite unaccessable and not easily appreciated by the uninformed, a lot of unappreciated music out there is actually quite good (musically speaking). In fact, the reason these bands are starting to make it is because they are good, and frankly a lot of the mainstream music has grown to be over commercialized, juvinalized, and lacks creative integrity. The problem for me, and those like me, is that before we had status. We were people who were smart enough to appreciate this good music. We were a step above all the rest who enjoyed System of the Down and Brittany Spears and Korn and Backstreet Boys and Avril Lavigne. If all those people start liking what we like, what makes us special?  It is somewhat of a sad reality that bands I favor to not enjoy some success so that I can feel good about myself. But it is a reality. No matter how many White Stripes songs I enjoy, I don't see myself buying a White Stripes album as long as 15 year olds who get their music from MTV are buying White Stripes Albums.  urlLink  postCount('108562765378265799');

       I have this problem recently where I get a song stuck in my head and I listen to it over and over and over again. Sometimes I will add a little dance in my chair at my desk when I listen to it. Other times I sing along with it in my car. Currently that song is the Yeah Yeah Yeah's  Maps . Previously it was Pavement's  Billie . Sometimes they aren't objectively good songs. I went through a week-long period where the song was No Doubt's  It's My Life . I'm embarassed to say that No Doubt is the #2 most played song on my iTunes with 38 plays.   I don't know how these songs get stuck in my head, or more appropriately why I become so incredibly obsessed with them. They are probably stuck in my head since I listen to them over and over and over again. I am currently listening to  Maps for I think the 6th or 7th time today. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to my musical obsessions. Sometimes is something as ridiculous (but catchy) as Beyonce's  Crazy in Love , other times something as nondescript as Elliot Smith's  Somebody I used to Know .   I just pushed repeat on  Maps  for the fourth time in a row.  Its really like an addiction. I gotta have this song. I am greatful for my trusty iPod. I can hear the song in my head all through class, but then dash out of the room and get my fix. During my No Doubt phase someone once played it very, very loudly outside my classroom. It was really hard to listen to my professor and not mouth the words.   Shit, I forget the words already. Maybe I should listen to that now.   Maybe its more like a crush. The sort of thing you obsess over for a week or two, and then you realize the guy isn't really all that great or not at all into you, and you're over it and move on to another boy. Yeah, I know that doesn't really happen anymore. I can't say life has been like that since 12th grade. But that is what my music fix is like. Its a string of petty teenage crushes on songs.   I've repeated this song for the 6th time in a row. I think I need to turn my computer off. This crush might become a little too obsessive.   urlLink  postCount('108502789978284716');

       I'm taking a little trip to Rochester today. I hope that my car makes it alright. This morning it was doing this weird stally thing it sometimes does. The car is a real peice of crap. That's probably a little unfair, its actually not a bad car its just really old and has gotten to the point where it is a big piece of crap. It has 180K+ miles, the driver's side inside door handle broke off, the other doors seem to have difficulty opening, the air conditioning does not work, the passenger side window doesn't roll down, there is a big dent in the left fender, you get the idea. My mom tells me that if my car breaks down to just leave it on the side of the road...I have a new car waiting for me at my parents house.  I am VERY excited about this car. It is a 2001 Jetta GTS with a sunroof. I have been wanting a Jetta for quite awhile, I think starting when they had the really cool ad campaign in the late 90's showing how hip VWs were. It wasn't just the hip-ness of the Jetta ad-campaign that made me want one. (Though, it was brilliant marketing. Currently VW ads aren't as smart, though Saturn seems to be moving away from the "join the saturn cult" campaign and filling the hip car campaign void, but I digress.) So many people around Colgate had Jetta's and everytime I saw one I thought they were the cutest little cars in the world. At that time I was driving a 1986 Dodge Charger with over 260K miles, I was allowed to covet cute cars.  When I was considering buying this car my friend told me not to buy a Jetta. He didn't think they were bad cars, but his reason was that "everyone our age drives a Jetta." While that statement is somewhat of a hyperbole, there are A LOT of recent model Jettas out there. I don't really have a problem with this. My current car, a powder blue 1989 Toyota Camry is also a very popular model. Despite being nearly 15 years old, I still see many many many powder blue Toyota Camry's on the road, especially here in Ithaca. Not having a particularly unique car is not a particularly big problem for me.   Besides, in the past I haven't driven cars that really fit my personality. My 1986 Dodge Charger said something like "I'm a guy in my 20s, I went to vocational school, I smoke Camels, I have a mullet, I wear T-Shirts for bands like White Snake and Pantera with the sleeves cut off." That really doesn't describe me at all. So what if I drive a car that says, "I'm a female in my 20's, I shop at the Gap, I know very little about cars but I want something reliable and cute, I like to drink Chai Lattes, Barnes & Noble is cool." That, for once, is a car that actually describes me.  urlLink  postCount('108455621196811500');

       So the big news today is that   Friends  final episode is tonight. I don't know, I just don't think its that big of a deal. Its not that I don't care about TV shows or anything. I'm not going to pretend like I have this big moral high ground to sit on or something. I would be totally lying if I said I do not become very invested in my television watching. I was devistated when  Seinfeld  went off the air, and I cried buckets at the series finale of   The Wonder Years . But in reality, I don't think I will miss  Friends  that much.  Listen, I don't think its a bad show. It might be a little over-rated, but in fact, I think its generally pretty funny. However, I've never been invested in the show. The more the writers and producers tried to make me care about the characters, the less I did. Monica and Chandler get married? Rachel has a baby? Joey and Rachel are in love? Pheobe marries Mike? The producers wanted me to say, "awwww..." but I was just felt "eh." The show became less about being funny and more about "Look at us grow up and mature and you care about us and our lives." Not so much.   Unlike  Seinfeld  that really left in its prime,  Friends  has overstayed its welcome. The characters have become charactetures of themselves. Monica was never that crazy, or Joey that dumb, or Ross that boring in the early episodes. And like I said, the focus changed considerably and the show became a lot less funny.  So though I plan on watching it tonight, I don't expect there to be any surprises. I'm sure the whole thing will wrap itself up in a nice little bow, and maybe they'll pump enough schmaltz into the whole deal to make some viewers (not me) shed a tear or two. And then that will be that, and I can watch Survivor without having to share the remote with my roommates who want to watch  Friends .  urlLink  postCount('108388552053498296');

       First a sidenote: I have been accused of having an "emo blog." Jeez louise, a girl says twice that she doesn't like being single and all the sudden I'm all emo. For the record, I have no intention of having an emo blog. Nobody said anything when I had two posts in a row devoted to Jesus.  In any case, yesterday I was in my office analyzing my master's data. (It was a beautiful day out, but I couldn't wait to see my data so I chose to do that instead...that's how you can tell I was meant for grad school.) Since it was Saturday and I was the only one around, I decided to listen to some music on my computer. At first I tried listening to  urlLink KEXP . At the time though it was a talk radio show, which happened to be devoted to discussions on the monorail project in Seattle. Considering 1). I can't hear the word "monorail" without thinking of that Simpson's episode where they build a monorail, and thus find the whole concept of monorails funny and 2). I don't live anywhere near the greater Seattle area (or even near Pacific time zone), I really had no interest in the discussion at all.  So then I decided to try to find a good internet station that would play me decent music and change things up from my "Quality Tunes" playlist on my iPod. That is when I stumbled upon  urlLink Launch at Yahoo . For most of the afternoon I was grooving out to Launch's Indie Rock  station which I was really enjoying. I even started making a list of songs and artists I didn't own that I liked. That alone was a nice find. But then, it got cooler. In taking a break from my work, I noticed that the Launch window had a little rating thing, where you could rate each song. This is where this stuff gets really cool. Basically you sign in and give them like 5 bands you like. Then it begins playing songs from those bands and from bands that people that like those bands like, and then you rate those, and then it plays you different songs based on your ratings. Essentially, its Amazon.com's recommendations only in a radio station. Luckily I discovered this towards the end of my work, because I just became to enthralled with rating songs and seeing what would come next on my personal radio station.  I think its fucking brilliant.   This find, however, came only 2 days after I updated my iTunes software only to discover that those people at Apple are so fucking smart too. Now  you can publish your playlists on the iTunes Music Store. All the songs that you have on your playlist that they have available gets put in a list, and people can buy your mixes. I was really impressed with their selection. They even had  urlLink Stipplicon . I spent, oh at least a good hour and half making new playlists and publishing them on iTunes.   Now, if I could only combine the geniuses at Apple with the geniuses at Yahoo. I predict in the next 2-3 years they will come out with an iPod with wireless network abilities so that in addition to playing mp3s they will also play internet radio stations, and if they are smart, custom radio stations based on the music you like. I would totally buy that. Maybe I should patent this idea before they think of it next!  urlLink  postCount('108351907550682230');

       I'm not sure who decided that everyone in America is on the Atkins diet, but someone must have. It seems like every other commercial these days is for some low-carb option of an old favorite. Subway has low-carb salads and wraps, as does Arby's. The Arby's commercial prominently featuring the "oven mitt" reading  The Truth about Carbs.  Slimfast has low-carb shakes. Donatoes, a popular pizza chain in Ohio has no crust pizza for carb watchers. Yesterday, while grocery shopping I noticed "Carb-wise" salad dressing, low carb yogurt, and "Carb Counting" bread. And now, Coke is marketing C2, low carb soda.  The whole low-carb craze really annoys me. First, I don't think this new onslaught of low-carb products and marketing reflects manufacturers becoming more health consious and offering healthier alternatives (I think Kellog's offering some of its kids cereals with less sugar is a move in that direction. While its low carb, they aren't marketing it that way). Yesterday I saw a commercial for Bud Light "Like all light beers its low in carbs, but unlike other light beers it has the great taste of bud light."  I'm not so sure that Bud Light really fits into a low-carb healthy diet, but maybe that's just me. Clearly someone noticed that (the now late) Dr. Atkins was making a lot of money marketing his own line of low-carb products for people on his diet, and they are trying to cash in on the craze. So, although Coke has had "low-carb" soda for years they are now offering a new "low carb" soda. Half the carbs...woo! Diet coke has NO carbs. If you were really a carb counter, you'd be drinking that.   Secondly, I'm not convinced that an Atkins style low-carb diet is really healthy. Sure, eating lots of refined sugars isn't good for you. It didn't take Dr. Atkins to tell you that. Is eating t-bone steaks icecream with half the carbs the answer? Probably not. I'm no nutritionist, but I still think eating in moderation is the key. Eat lots of fruits and veggies and lean meats and you will be fine. Some bread or pasta is not going to hurt you every now and then. There are no long term studies showing the health risks or benefits. I know that there have been a few studies showing people lost weight after a year on Atkins, but I am sure if I went on a 1 icecream sundae 1 bowl of lucky charms a day diet I'd loose weight too...though 10 years from now I doubt I'd be healthy.  Finally I'm not even sure its a craze. It seems to be a craze manufactured on Madison Ave. Nobody I know is on Atkins. I know a few people who have tried it, all of whom didn't like it for whatever reason and quit. I know my mom did it for awhile, lost some weight, and gained it all right back. I think people need to get over it. I really don't care about products for my low-carb life style....and I think I will stick to regular diet Coke.  urlLink  postCount('108744055641775194');

       Yaeka asked me (and some other pals) to think of our top 10 albums of all time. Apparently there is a recent blog trend to make these lists. I'll join the fun. Here are my top 10 (not necessarily in order):   1.  Nirvana -  Unplugged In New York       This was like the first non-top 40 pop music album I ever bought. I got it my freshman year in highschool and fell in love with it. This album marked the turning point in the kind of music I listen too and really changed my musical tastes. The last album I had bought before this one was the Body Guard Soundtrack with Whitney Houston. It was also the last album Nirvana released while Kurt Cobain was alive which I think makes it significant.   2.  Weezer -  Pinkerton       Pinkerton is definitely one of the best albums to come out of the 90's. I loved it when in came out in 97 (or was it '96?) and I still really really enjoy it. Its fun and upbeat and catchy, while still being smart. I think its a clear evolution and progression from the Blue Album which is also good and smart. Then, unfortunately Weezer became an emo band and lacked the wit and creativity captured in Pinkerton.   3. Radiohead -  OK Computer       Radiohead is probably one of the most significant bands of modern alternative music. I have to give them props - Despite their ever growing popularity they have yet to sell out. They continue to change and evolve, but I don't think they care much about what everyone else thinks, as long as they are happy with their music. I think OK Computer is their best album, and marks the transition from their earlier Brit-Rock sound to their later synthesized more ambient sound.    4. John Vanderslice -  Time Travel is Lonely      Its no secret that I think J.V. is d'bomb. While all 4 of his albums are incredibly fine pieces of musical work, Time Travel is Lonely, is by far the best. As a concept album its not overdone, in fact just listening to it, the concept is not clear unless one reads the liner notes. Including the liner-note aspect adds another interesting dimension. Its really well constructed. While there are a number of stand-out tracks, the album works best as a whole. I can listen to it over and over and never get tired of it.   5. Elliot Smith -  Either/Or       Honestly, I wish I owned/listened to more Elliot Smith albums so I could comment on Either/Or in comparison to the rest. I know its superior to X/O and Figure 8, which were both major label releases, though I cannot comment on it in comparison to his self-titled release or Roman Candle (all tracks I have heard off those albums are definitely worthy). This album, although it is very very good, makes my list more because of personal significance. I happened to buy it at a really rough time in my life, and this album spoke to me in a way no album ever has before or since. I really felt like every song could have been written by me or about me. I know that sounds really corny, but its true and makes Either/Or an important part of my list.   6. Stipplicon -  Stipplicon      Like Nirvana's Unplugged Album, Stipplicon marks another musical transition for me. The addition of Stipplicon to my CD collection marked my transition from major label "alternative" bands to indie bands. Stipplicon is definitely indie, this album was released by the band's own Pro-Anti Records. I saw them live my soph year in college and fell in love with them. They seriously rocked out. Despite their ever-changing line-up (with the obvious exception of Jack Dishel who fronts the band, and Strickly Beats who still plays drums) they never let me down. This album is a high-energy, highly-creative rock album.   7.  The Flaming Lips -  Transmissions from the satellite Heart      I first bought this album on tape when it came out my freshman year in high school. I had seen the "Turn it On" video on Alternative Nation on MTV. While "She don't use Jelly" was the most popular song on the album my favorite was ***** (Plastic Jesus). Unfortunately, Transmissions never made it to CD. I recently rediscovered it when I bought it on CD for $8 in  a used CD store. Its a shame I wasn't listening to it for all those years.    8. Pedro the Lion -  Control         I know conventional wisdom is that Control is not David Bazan's best album. I'm a big fan of it however. Though I know the concept isn't that original (modern marriage falls apart through infidelity), but the music is really really good. I think Rapture is the best song about sex ever, and Priests and Paramedics is excellent song about death and dying. I wish I could say something else smart about this album, but I really can't, I just like it a lot.    9. The Moldy Peaches -  Moldy Peaches         I often dream of being in a band, but I lack musical talent of any sort. The Moldy Peaches help me keep my dream alive. Not because they are so bad, but because they are so good. With not much more than a keyboard, a drum machine, and a few friends that can play guitars, Kimya Dawson and Adam Green constructed an album worth listening to. The songs go from inane (These Burgers) to obscene (Downloading Porn with Dave) to sugary sweet (Anyone one else). Its smart, honest, and raw.    10. Neutral Milk Hotel -  In the Aeroplane Over the Sea       Although this album came out in 1998, I only discovered it recently. That's a shame. The album is thick, intricate, dark at times, but incredibly catchy. From the first time I heard "Two Headed Boy" I was hooked. Its been nearly 6 years, I hope this isn't the last we hear from Neutral Milk Hotel. (Picking one for the 10th spot was really hard...other contenders include: Modest Mouse,  Building Nothing Out of Something ; Damien Jurado,  Rehearsals for Departure ; Death Cab for Cutie,  The Photo Album ; and 764-Hero,  Get Here and Stay .  urlLink  postCount('108636377922054389');

       The world seems filled with people who enjoy making everyone their friend. There are those people who refer to everyone they sorta kinda know as "my friend." There are those incurable social butterflies who are always surrounded by people and seem to thrive off the company of others. Then there are those who treat complete strangers or near strangers like an old dear friend. The cashiers at the grocery store who divulge all their problems to every customer who comes through their lane. Customers who do the same (once when I worked retail a woman pulled out photos of a wrecked car that she was recently in an accident in).   My new pseudo-friend is Lori, the custodian on my floor. My first encounter with her happened when I came into my office a little early one day. I was surprised to find Lori sitting at my desk talking on my phone. When I walked in she explained to me that her teenage daughter had run away from home and she was on the phone with her high school letting them know that they are not to discuss her daughter with her ex-husbands girlfriend even though her daughter was living with the girlfriend. Then she said, "You work with kids, you should be able to figure her out." I told her I worked with young kids and couldn't help her with her daughter, but that it did seem like a tough situation she was dealing with.  I thought this was a little weird. But I had heard of students walking in on building staff doing much worse in the early morning hours so I decided not to be weirded out too much by it. Lori, though, seemed to be warmed by my kind response. I'm the only grad student on my floor, perhaps the faculty that have offices there are generally less than friendly. Or perhaps, they just aren't around much in the mornings to interact with her. Maybe Lori just thought I seemed cool. I'm not really sure exactly what it is, but suddenly Lori started acting like my nest best friend.  It started out small. She would say hi to me when she would see me come in. Once when I was gone for the weekend I returned to newly mopped floors. I was okay with being nice to the cleaning lady. Then things got a little weirder. Once she was refilling the bathroom with toiletries and came buy my office with a bag of toilet paper, "Here" she said handing me a roll. "Do you want more for home? Take them in your bag." I really didn't need to lug home multiple rolls of one-ply toilet paper so I declined. She also gave me a whole bunch of garbage bags and told me where the unlocked supply closet is, in case, I suppose, I am ever in desperate need of one-ply toilet paper, gallon trash bags, and those brown paper towels that fill public restrooms.  Then she got on this kick where my floors needed to be waxed. She told me repeatedly that if I told my boss to email her boss and ask for my floors to be waxed she would wax them. I wasn't going to ask Professor Wang to email building services asking for a floor being waxed. Still, she wouldn't let up on the whole floor wax thing. One morning I was in a meeting with a professor when Lori walks in the professor's office and interrupts our meeting. "I'm gonna say something to you, and you are gonna say something back to me," she said. "Uh okay.." was my response. "If you tell me that you want your floor waxed I can wax it, but you didn't hear me say that." So I told her I'd like my floor waxed. This seemed to bring her a lot of pleasure. Currently, my whole office is sitting in the hallway waiting for Lori to wax my floors tomorrow morning.  There are other things she has done that seems to go beyond the friendly exchange of people who work in the same building. She brought me donuts one day for donating money to a kid who was doing relay for life she was collecting for, she asked me to sign a sympathy card for another member of the custodial staff that I had already told her I did not know, and once when my research assistant was leaving me a note on the door that she was going up to her other job but to IM her if I needed anything Lori added a note to the bottom that said "But it don't matter because I'm not gonna do nothing."   I'm not sure if Lori is just one of those naturally friendly people who makes everyone she comes in contact with her friend. From my observation she seems extra friendly to me, but there really aren't many people on my floor to be friendly with. If I am special, I'm not sure what singled me out for her friendliness. Maybe for once someone in an academic building didn't turn their intellectual noses up to the custodial staff. Maybe faculty are generally to late arriving and too busy to take the time to talk with her. I'm not really sure. Though I did notice the other day there were a number of long distance calls made on my phone, that I did not make. Perhaps its not me at all, but just my telephone.  In any case this new friendship has at least gained me unlimited access to all the toilet paper I want.  urlLink  postCount('109088840205415569');

       I changed my commenting settings back to my old halo scan account. Now anyone can comment. I realized after I went and did this that I could have gone back and made my blogger commenting avialable to anyone. But I had already entered the code and was too lazy to go back and take it out again. So now, anyone may add comments to my posts.  I promise that I will write something more substantial soon. I realize I have been a bit lazy lately with posting. By lazy I mean not posting anything at all in the past 3 weeks. I just don't want to post if I don't have anything mildly interesting to say, even though I do provide the disclaimer that you shouldn't expect me to say anything interesting. I'd hate to turn into my  urlLink old blog  where I'd write stupid posts about how I like grape nuts or my roommates were cooking soemthing with onions. I also don't want to turn into one of those blogs where people try really really really hard to be interesting and so they go into these "deep" tirades that just make them sound like someone off of  My So Called Life . (A really great example of this is a former student in my departments  urlLink page . Unfortunately its been down for about a month now).   So yes, I  promise when I have something not dumb to talk about I will talk about it. Untill then, you all can go back and add comments to all the posts that were commented on post comment change.   urlLink  postCount('109068497112201261');

       Once Yaeka and I wrote a song about bad karma. I don't remember it too well, I think there was a line that was something like, "Stub your toe, BAAAD KAR-MA." Essentially the whole song was "Something bad happens to you, BAAD KAR-MA." I think it would have been one of our hit songs, after "Rockstar Party" and "Fish and Tomatoes." Unfortunately, we never did start our band, and so the bad karma song has been lost for eternity.  The reason I mention this song, is sometimes I wonder if their really is a such thing as karma. I mean I see some people, and I think, "Man oh man, they really should be racking up the bad karma..." And yet, I see no evidence that this bad karma they should be racking up has come back to bite them in the ass. Although I may invent crazy stories to placate myself, I'm always left with the nagging knowledge that their is no cosmic justice.  But behold, I'm starting to come around. Bad karma it seems takes awhile to catch up to you. I know this because the bad roommate karma I gained during my college years has finally come to bite me in the ass. More particularly, my bad washing dishes roommate karma.  Anyone who lived with me from 1998-2002 can attest that I was always the messy roommate. I was the one that didn't clean the stovetop immediately after making rice-o-roni. I was the one who left dishes in the sink (with every intention of washing them) that were more promptly washed by one of my more immaculate roommates. I was the one people were pissed off by on a fairly regular basis. That was me.  Since graduating I have had my share of not so wonderful roommate-ness. Most people know about the situation with my first post-Hamilton NY roommate. She was messy yes, but I think that was the least of her problems. I don't think she reflects the cosmos getting back at me, at least not for doing dishes. If she was the result of bad karma, I must have done some pretty awful things to people. Perhaps I did, and perhaps someone somewhere got word of how my life sucked with her and felt a little better. I don't think I'm that bad of a person though, so I will chalk it up to bad luck and not bad karma.  I currently have a new roommate. She is subletting from one of my previous roommates but will continue to live here in the fall. Overall I think she is a really nice person, and not "nice" in a generic "I don't have anything else to say about her" sort of way. I really like her. Except one thing. She's fucking messy as shit. I mean she cooks all the time. Myself and my other roommate aren't big cookers. She's like a 4 pan a day sort of lady. She cooks and she never ever does the dishes afterwards. At first I bit the bullet given my prior history. Every morning though, after my tae bo cardio, I would do all the dishes in the sink. Usually 1 or 2 would be mine. I was annoyed, but not annoyed to the point that I would need to write a whole blog post about it. But then, then, I realized the cosmos were definitely out to get me. On a rare occasion I did a little cooking for dinner (essentially I am running out of money and thus am forcing myself to eat the food I have before I buy more food, which I generally food you have to make, which is why it hasn't been eaten, but that is not important for the point), and on this rare occasion she was doing her dishes. Given that I had been doing her dishes for her for about a week, I assumed that she would wash mine as well. You can already see where this is going...I woke up the next morning and only her dishes were washed.   I probably should have said something sort of in a nice way like "Oh just so you know, the way we usually do dishes is everyone washes everyone's dishes but we try to take turns so nobody is doing them all the time." I settled on passive-aggressive and just stopped washing everyone's but my own. Then she left for a weekend leaving some (though granted not all) of her dishes still in the sink. I swore I wasn't going to wash them. But then I used her salad dressing to make a pasta salad to take to a picnic without asking her. So I eventually did do her dishes. I don't want any more bad karma.  urlLink  postCount('108909127553795424');

       Since my last post about Fahrenheit 9/11 (which again...EVERYONE should go see), I've read some more reviews and comments on the movie. I thought about adding these additional thoughts of mine to the original post below, but I decided it to add a new post.  I've noticed a lot of people criticizing the movie because although it shows American brutality in Iraq it fails to show the brutality of the terrorists who are harming America. In fact, one Midwestern chain is  urlLink refusing to show the film  because of this apparent one sided-ness. Moore, for example shows U.S. soldiers inflicting pain on innocent Iraqi people, but does not show footage of 9/11 (he shows instead a blank black screen where we hear the sounds of terror but do not see it) or footage of American soldiers being beheaded by Saudi terrorists. Therefore, this line of reasoning goes, the movie supports terrorism and the terrorists, and is a leftist one sided attack on American sensibilities.   I agree that the movie is definitely agenda filled. The problem I have with this line of reasoning against the movie is that, it simply misses the point. The point of the movie is that the Iraqi people have nothing to do with September 11 or other acts of terrorism against Americans. Many people seem to be failing to grasp that these acts of terrorism are not important for the war in Iraq because they have nothing to do with the war in Iraq In fact, the movie is quite critical of Bush's lackadaisical approach to Afghanistan and the Taliban post (and pre) Sept 11 (for example he notes that only 11,000 troops were actually sent to Afghanistan, a number that is fewer than the amount of cops in NYC.) He clearly doesn't believe that terrorists should be allowed to roam free and plot to destroy more Americans. Rather, he argues that Bush's foreign policies did a bad job of actually fighting terrorists and terrorism, and the "war on terror" is just an easy way to sell a pre-panned war with Iraq to the American people.   In fact, the war with Iraq seems like a step backward in the war on terror. According to a recent article in  urlLink Time  since the U.S. invasion, Iraq has become an even more fertile breeding ground for Jihadists. The war has incited more hatred and given more fuel to the terrorists, rather than doing anything positive to fight terrorists and terrorism.   So yeah, like I said before, go see Farheneit 9/11 and think a little bit about the issues and our country and the policies of our leaders.   urlLink  postCount('108896775093031578');

       I went to see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  with a bit of skepticism. I'm not the world's biggest Michael Moore fan. I think he's a little full of himself and a bit too Leftish for my tastes. The reviews I had read were favorable, but tended to note that the movie was more entertainment than documentary, and most coverage seemed to focus on the conspiracy with the Saudi's and Bush is a Buffoon aspects of the movie. I'm currently not a Bush supporter, mostly due to his ill-conceived war with Iraq. (I won't go into why I think the war was ill conceived, the movie and more articulate pundits have already highlighted why it was a really bad idea.) At the same time, I'd never consider myself a member of the far left (in fact, I voted Republican in every major election thus far, a trend that will change this year) and while I think the war was ill-conceived, in my opinion ignorance was a bigger contributor than greed (although I won't deny greed matters).   Seeing a movie like Fahrenheit 9/11 in Ithaca is an experience. I originally planned to see it on Tuesday, but we were greeted with a ridiculously long line. The small independent theater that is showing the film only has two shows a day and sells tickets only 30 minutes in advance. We showed up 30 minutes in advance, when we should have showed up about an hour in advance of the 30 minutes in advance to by the tickets. This only made a movie that I sort of wanted to see a movie I really HAD to see, since now there was a challenge (& I DO love challenges!!) I got in line at 5:55 to wait for tickets to go on sale at 6:45. Already a considerable line had formed. As  I stood in line men came by registering people to vote, someone passed out flyers for a peace vigil, a woman showed up with her Congo drum and chants, and another group set up their table full of "Bush Must Go" merchandise. Granted, in Ithaca these people probably would have been hanging out on the Commons anyways, but not necessarily targeting themselves to a movie-going crowd.  Context aside, the movie was really good. I don't know how much credit I want to give Michael Moore himself. I read one  urlLink review  that notes that the best parts of the film are when Moore is "willing to forget his personal animosities." I tend to agree. The footage from Iraq is gruesome, the footage of an American mother whose son was killed in service - a mother who is proud her children are in the military and claims her family and those like hers are "the backbone of America" - reading the last letter her son sent her from Iraq is moving, footage of U.S. soldiers in V.A. hospitals stating how pointless the war is and how they will never vote republican again is a powerful statement. These scenes are I think what makes the movie worthwhile, and sends the strongest statement against the war in Iraq.   Although I went into the movie with skepticism, expecting to see an obviously one-sided political charged film, I left feeling a combination of sadness, guilt, and embarrassment for my country and myself as a citizen. Even admitting the film is one-sided, I don't see how one could sit through it and not have the slightest tinge that perhaps it WOULD be a good idea to get Bush out of office.   So yes, I encourage everyone to go see this movie, especially those who are pro-Bush and the war. Even if it doesn't change your mind, it should at least make you think. In my opinion, thinking is always a good thing.  urlLink  postCount('108870180065104430');

       Am I lame for spending the last 2 hours working on my iTunes organization? I'm revamping the system I have going. For awhile I was trying to make the genres more specific. Instead of the generic Alternative/Punk defult that usually pops up when I import my CDs, I made them Indie Rock, Indie Pop, Punk, etc etc etc. Then I decided I wanted to be even more specific, adding things like Indie Singer/Songwriter, Riot Grrrl, and Indie Post Punk Revivial. It was becoming quite cluttered with over 70 (yes 70) different genres (there were also some genres that were essentially the same thing but I hadn't cleaned up like rap, hip/hop rap, hip hop).   I then realized, through the helpful advice of PhiLL who was doing a good job helping me come up with good genres, that I was really thinking more along the lines of styles or sub genres. I decided to then to go back and change all my genres to basics, and then add an additional column of "grouping" which includes my sub-genres. Much of this project has involved the helpful world of  urlLink All Music.com , which has provided me with most of my sub-genre groupings.  So far my basic genres are: Rock, Indie, Classic Rock, Hip-Hop/Rap, R&B. Pop, Vocal, Instrumental, Country, Jazz, and Classical. I have over 40 sub genres so far. I had them all listed out here, but then I erased the list given that it just highlights the extent of my dorkiness.   The next step in the grand iTunes reorganization is to create smart playlists based on these sub genres. I've been trying to think of clever titles for my smart playlists, but since I am not all that clever I think they are just amusing to me. "Umm, I don't listen to main stream music" is the title of my indie playlist. "If I were doing drugs I'd be listening to this" is the name of my ambient pop/neo-psychedelia/prog-rock/psychadelic/post-rock experimental playlist. I'm struggling with the name for my folk rock/alternative country/ lo fi/ singer-songwriter list. Right now its "Play your accoustic guitar white boy" but I don't know how I feel about that.  All of this is to say that I am a big lame dork. And now you know too, in case there was any question.  urlLink  postCount('109141691748714795');
