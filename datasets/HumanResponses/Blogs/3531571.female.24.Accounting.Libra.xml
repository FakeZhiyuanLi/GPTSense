						   here i am again at my work. lately it feels like there is no pressure on me.  work is flowing fine, im actually caught up with my own crap and learning to post ERA files - it was fun but when i start dealing with credit balances and penalties - that's when it gets hard and confusing. anyways, life in general is doing alright. altho' a part me sometimes misses my husband.  i know deep down in my heart at the very bottom.. ahahah - i still love the dude.. but the life he wants to live is not the way i want to live.  inseparable differences - so they say! he gets the kids sometimes and that anger and hatred that i feel when i see him is not there anymore. I don't feel that i want him either. Don't get me wrong, i guess i am really moving on. altho' some people still bug me to go back to him for the sake of the kids.  What good will that do if we are not gonna get along? if he's still going to out all the time, if he still won't be able to support his own family, if his ass is still attach to his mom? maybe when he change, maybe when he realize things, MAYBE just maybe i will re- consider.  KIds.. are growing up. next month i'm going to enroll them to dolores st school.  so they start learning and have a social life so they dont fight all the time.  i just need to get that yellow immunization card from the doctor.  that's a painful $25.00 for each. OUCH! Camp is coming and i dont want to miss it.  but i dont have enough PTO here at work. ionno how im gonna get there and pay for the registration.  love life...is boring! no crushes no attraction.. oh i bought a tube dress yesterday! it was so cute, was 59.99 but i got it for $23.49 yiba!! i think thats what im gonna wear on Erwin and Ida's wedding. jomar is my date - my exbf - wahahhahh im a dork!  i just need to lose this bulging belly and wallah!! check me out!  oh and im gonna cut my hair this friday - ala judy ann santos.. yup yup that short! i'll post a pic on my friendster account so y'all can see! IM SO EXCITED!! hmmm i think my title for this blog does not match ahahahah.. oh well! its not summer blues after all..

						    Dream Of Me   by Kirsten Dunst   Let me sleep For when I sleep I dream that you are here You're mine  And all my fears are left behind  I float On air  The nightingale sings gentle lullabies So let me close my eyes  And sleep  Perchance,  to dream So I can see the face I long to touch To kiss But only dreams can bring me this  So let  The moon  Shine  Softly on the boy I long to see And maybe when he dreams He'll dream of me  I hide beneath the clouds And whisper to the evening stars They tell me love is just a dream away A dream away  So let  The moon  Shine softly on the boy I long to see And maybe when he dreams He'll dream of me  Oh...dream of me

						   In the story of your life, write the best book you can.  Have pages on understanding and the tales of overcoming hardships.  Fill your story with romance, adventure, poetry and humor.  Make each chapter reflect time well spent.                             frm:100 things to Always Remember  I was born October 15, 1979, no one in my family knows or remember the time or at least know if it was day or night. i guess im adopted. I didnt have much baby pictures because my mom said we were broke when they had me. I think my baby pictures started when i was already months old.  Let's think of it this way, i was not wanted in the family, i was an accident, they weren't prepared for me to come. Oh well, im here now. I grew up in the province of Cavite, on the little barrio of Malagasang II.  My dad has a auto-body shop, my mom is an accountant that works day and night. I was a sickly baby, had H-fever twice, almost died the second time. I grew up with my lola and tita's because my parents are rarely home for us. I think i started drinking coffee when i was 8.. pouring coffee on rice for breakfast. I went to Maranatha Christian Academy for Preparatory School and got 2nd honors. On my graduation, was the same day as my older sisters recognition day, i think she got 2nd also.  My mom had to be at two places at the same time. She chose to be with my ate. It was like we were getting the award at the same time and my award was given to me by my aunt who was wearing only her dress and a pair of slippers for she was just gonna watch the whole graduation rites.  Since then, when i enrolled at the public school to enter first grade, i didn't do well. I would pass all of my exams and subject but I never strived to get an award. My sister always get one, 2nd or 3rd but never the first. On first grade my dad was called to the office of the Principal because i started a fight with one boy in my class. Hey! i was doing a self defense! He hit my hand so i hit him in the face. and then he cried went home and told his mom! what a cry baby. and then 1986 came my mom left for Canada it was the Araw ng mga patay. November 1st 1986 in the morning, we were all in the airport, everyone was crying except for me.  i didnt care! i think.. anyways, life in elementary went on.. 3rd grade my dad was called again in the Principal's office this time i got in a fight with a girl classmate. we were pulling each other's hair. turned out she's related to me. lol! On and on.. i had crushes, growing older, but still acts like a boy. in short i was a tomboy. Play 'sikyo' after school which drove my dad crazy coz i would not go home until all the kids are gone.  Home is not a place for me to stay at. On saturdays i would spend my day riding the bike. and sunday i go to the church then glue myself in front of the TV. My first real crush came when i was in 5th grade.  His name is Elgeelad Nato. I was friends with him coz 'i was one of the boys' no one else knew but my bestfriend RIO. I would sit with him, walk with him on the way home. i was in heaven! we were close buddies then..i began to act like a girl a little bit... i started ironing my uniform before going to school and fix my hair a little. 6th grade we had different sections. like always, they combined all the "smarties" on section I and the not so smarties on Section II. I was on the 1st. We grew apart since he started hangin out with the boys and i became part of a girl group called Jmakers. Jaymel, Marilou, Alma, Kathy, Elsie, Rio and Shiela. It was the most memorable year of my elementary days. I did nothing! I was popular among my batch. well there's only how many of us? less than a hundred?!?!? The day before our graduation, while waiting for the rehearsal to start i was writing on the ground - a heart with "melgie' in it. Alvin saw it and got it all figured out and told Elgeelad on me. Since then, until today he doesn't even say hi to me anymore. My graduation was the saddest! My dad was there.. i remember.. he was wearing a yellow sriped polo shirt. hay.... not even formal enough for the occasion but im happy he came! SUmmer passed. i have to enroll for highschool~ at long last i'll be so much farther from home... Imus Institute here i come.. Ist year of high school.. i was just a quiet chick. I made friends right away with my seatmates Dorothy and Sherryll Ramos and ROse behind me. Michelle Alpas sits in the front.. I dont even know how we became friends-best friends! oh i think because when we went to 2nd yr i only knew her and she knew me plus Ersylen from her elementary school. We were then the Three loud girls in the class. 3rd year i was still in class with Michelle, the bonding was stronger. we would share secrets and crushes that only the two of us would know.  she with JANICE ALDANA and i with so many men i have crush on.  3rd year we had a group there was eleven of us, If i could remember right. Yvette, Korrina, aileen, Michelle, me, raquel, pichie, d two more girls i forgot the names.. ehehhe... 4th year.. michelle and i had different sections. i then, hung out with different crowds.. mostly lesbians, and girls crushing on girls... hay... this was the year michelle and i acted as if we didnt know each other. until i had to go to US to migrate.. march 22, 1996. i didn't even have the chance to attend graduation because my visa was gonna expire on the 29th and graduation was on the 31st. Michelle said they called my name still on graduation and most my friends stood up and clap their hands.. how sweet!  my life in the US will follow.. i'll be back and tell you more.. for now i have to go back to work ahahahah 2:03pm.. im finally gonna do something productive..

						   Can I call you mine 	Even if you already belong to someone? Can I hold you in my arms 	And let me feel the warmth of your embrace?  Will you sit right next to me 	In a cold and quiet night? Will you keep me company  	And let me be with you even just for a while?  Hear my plea, I’m begging you.  To take me with you wherever you go 	And let’s wait until the sunlight starts to fade. To watch the moon and the stars appear in the night. 	And wait for the star to fall          and wish that someday you will be 		 		    All mine....  Jaymel..

						   be still, sad heart and cease repining; behind the clouds is the sun still shining; thy fate is the common fate of all, into each life some rain might fall,  some days must be dark and dready.

						   When I say I love you I do But this with you will not do I need someone I can lean on Someone I can count on too  Yes you are there sometimes For that I am grateful to you But I need someone there full time And that you can not do  You told me once you loved me That I could believe in you I was there when you needed someone Where were you when I needed someone, too?  The time has come for me to let go Never to expect you to care again People may come and people may go But my love will never end     ..i will keep on loving, even if its not you.... jaymel

						     MASTERCARD WEDDING  &nbsp;   You gotta love this guy.....&nbsp; This is a true story about a recent wedding that&nbsp;took place at Clemson University. It was in the local&nbsp;newspaper&nbsp;and even Jay Leno mentioned it.&nbsp;It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests. After the&nbsp;wedding at&nbsp;the reception, the groom got up on stage with a microphone to&nbsp;talk to the crowd. He said he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their&nbsp;wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride's and his&nbsp;family and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such&nbsp;a lavish reception. As a token of his deep appreciation&nbsp;he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just&nbsp;from him. So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair,&nbsp;including the wedding party, was a manila envelope.&nbsp;He said this was his gift to everyone, and asked&nbsp;them to open their envelope.&nbsp;Inside each manila envelope was an 8 x 10 glossy&nbsp;of his bride having sex with the best man. The groom&nbsp;had gotten suspicious of them weeks earlier and had hired a&nbsp;private detective to tail them. After just standing there,&nbsp;just&nbsp;watching the guests' reactions for a couple of minutes, he&nbsp;turned&nbsp;to the best man and said, "F--- you!".&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned to his bride and said, "F--- you!".&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and&nbsp;said, "I'm outta here."&nbsp;&nbsp;He had the marriage annulled first thing in the&nbsp;morning. While most people would have canceled the wedding&nbsp;immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes&nbsp;through with the charade, as if nothing were wrong. His&nbsp;revenge.... making the bride's parents pay over $32,000 for a&nbsp;300&nbsp;guest wedding and reception, and best of all, trashing the&nbsp;bride's and best man's reputations in front of 300&nbsp;friends and family members. This guy has balls the size&nbsp;of church bells.&nbsp; Do you think we might get a MasterCard "priceless"&nbsp;commercial out of this?&nbsp;&nbsp;Elegant wedding reception for 300 family members and&nbsp;friends..........$32,000. Wedding photographs commemorating&nbsp;the&nbsp;occasion.........................$3,000.&nbsp; Deluxe two week honeymoon accommodations in&nbsp;Maui........................$8,500.&nbsp;&nbsp; The look on everyone's face when they see the 8x10&nbsp;glossy of the bride&nbsp;humping the best man............................&nbsp;.......................Priceless!
