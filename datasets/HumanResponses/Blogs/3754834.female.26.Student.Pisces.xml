      The great purging begins. I have decided to mentally vomit for everyone's amusement! I find it highly ironic that the anonymity of a blog allows us to delve into a cathartic state with total strangers. If that same inner catharsis was written in a diary, we would keep it under lock and key... never to see the light of day. Why does the digital divide create a feeling of security? Why are we able to speak volumes about someone we have a crush on in a diary yet become tongue tied when anywhere of a 10 foot radius of the person? Maybe it is because the fear of rejection vanishes; conflicts resolve with a few taps of the keys, decisions are made by looking at the ever loyal, steadily blinking cursor. Maybe it is the protected world from others seeing the emotions in our heart, the butterflies in our stomach, and the tears in our eyes. Maybe I stumbled upon nirvana.

      Today I wake up from a long awaited nap finding myself losing heart.  I don't know how the events of my life led me here- to a state of delicious anxiety and moral dread.  Almost two years ago, I found myself at a moral crossroad.  I took the path I thought I wanted.  But this path has had its winding doublebacks and thickets full of thorns, and I ended up not where I thought I would be.  Yes, I am surrounded by those who love me with all their heart.  I am back in school actively persuing my undergrad degree.  I have a roof over my head and a meal in my tummy.  I surround myself with life in varied forms... plants, a cat, the spider in the window, the dust bunny population under my bed.  But I find a deep, unsettling, yet small blackhole forming in the dark recesses of my mind.   I feel as if my life has been in pause for years now.  Neither moving forward or backward, just existing day by day.  From the outside it would appear that I'm in perfect momentum, achieving my goals and dreams.  Yet... I don't know what my goals and dreams are.  I meld my being to those around me.  I don't know what it is like to be the person I call me.  I woke up today finding myself full of resentment, anger, even hate... and I asked myself, when did I become so full of negativity?  When did I truly stop living my life?  Maybe the better question is, have I ever lived my life? Faith... never offered me solice.  How can it?  Faith is a personal contract with divinity.  It can be forged and broken on some of the most insignificant or life altering terms.  Likewise, religion leaves me lost amongst a group of perfect strangers.  There is an undefined emptiness inside of me, pushing me on a quest to find the elusive, intangible object of something I do not know.   So, the question is... where do I go from here?  Do I continue this meandering existance, reacting to every situation?  Or do I learn to understand the spirit of things, flow fluidly like a willow with my life and stop trying to be something I am not.

      Not weird, not strange, absolutely spastic.  It started off on a race against the impending tests at the end of the week.  One in cell biology and the other in calculus.  Neither of which I did especially well on... sigh.  But serendipity came to visit on Tuesday.  I studied all weekend to get caught up on calculus.  Even though my professor is a thrilling lecturer, I dreaded going to that class.  Why?  Because I was so lost and behind I was afraid to be called on.  I did manage to perfect my ability to sink slowly down in my seat and shrivel up into a tiny point on the continous function in the space of my academic career.  I can take the derivative of my happy ass... but I sure can't seem to integrate it.  Tom would be proud of my slight physics/calculus reference.  But I digress...  Serendipity... I found myself with a quiz in cell bio on Tuesday, and I couldn't pick out cellular respiration from a police lineup and I wasn't going to have any time to study... or was I?  My cell bio lecture ended 45 minutes early, so I had an hour to read the chapter.  Then my genetics lecture started and 15 minutes into it... the fire alarm was pulled, so I had another hour and a half.  Then calculus let out early.  So I ended up with almost three and half hours of study time thrown into my lap as a gift.  I aced the quiz... my ego got stroked and I made the executive decision to cut back on the classes I take next session.  Then I found out I had more money than I thought, so I got to eat sushi for dinner.  Then I went to physics, only to find out Tom, my instructor, had to finish moving... soo.... class was cancelled.  So I went home and slept.  Yay!    But then... blood sugar mayhem ensued and I couldn't remember ANYTHING for the next two days and subsequently performed abysmally on my two exams.  Then I picked up a screw in the tire I just replaced two months ago.  My donut is in shambles so I am relagated to wedging the screw into the tread and airing up the tire on a daily basis and putting out a contract with divinity- please oh please oh please don't go flat on meeeeeee.... in the middle of the ghettooo... oh pretty please!!  But I did get to play with acid at work- washing sampling bottles for the cave and creek project I'm on.  Yes, working in the clean lab is not exactly exciting, but I do get to make a fashion statement.  I don on my mushroom hat and matching psuedo paper/fabric lab coat and go into a pressurized room  and look important for a couple of hours  :)    In other wonderful news, I managed to keep my car from getting repo'd this month and got a contract extension on my payments to get me caught up.  This car has been the bane of my existance for the last 4 years, and I'm not about to let the unfortunate coincidence of me lacking money to get in the way of my owning it!  In some other not so earth shattering but definitely seismic activity news... CAKE is coming to the Austin music festival in September!!!  Now I have to figure out who to make my new best friend to get a ticket to the Sunday performance.  I really haven't done anything fun for myself in over a year.  So, in the spirit of being less crabby and hermit-like, I've decided that going to see CAKE will be an excellent start.
