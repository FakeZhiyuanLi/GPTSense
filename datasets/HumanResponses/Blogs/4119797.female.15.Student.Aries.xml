      I swear, that surely but slowly, I'm going dislexic. Today, while in Harvey's I was going to go get some straws and stuff and I looked at the little packages of pepper. I read, "Poultry" but in fact, they said, "Poivre". The other day when I was on the plane, my mom was reading a newspaper, to me it said, "Poltergeist marries again." When it actually said, "Polygamist marries again." These are just a few of my dislexic moments. I still seem to be able to write things which is good.  I made a braclet last night at like 3 am. It turned out to be pretty cool, it's just a bunch of different coloured beads in no order with a random heart bead, but it's cool. I bet you wish you had one. Maybe I'll start a business. I'll call it "Crazy BEADS" and our slogan could be like, "We'll have you eating, breathing, thinking BEADS!" Then I'll take over the word. I'll plant subliminal messages.

      I've just realized how much certain people piss me off! I won't name names because I'd rather not start anything. I just want to vent. The stupid little things that they can't say to my face and the way they act like nothing is wrong. If you don't have the guts to say whatever you have to say about me, to my face, then don't say it at all. Talking behind someone's back is so juvinile. Are we all in grade 2 again?  *Marge-like groan*

      I have to fly soon and I'm sooooo scared! Like it makes me sick just thinking about flying. I don't even know what it is, that I'm afraid of. I'm not afraid of heights or dieing, I think it's more a control issue. Maybe I'd feel better if they let me drive the plane. I'm also scared of lakewater, rollercoasters, and elevators...  WOAH! PSYCHO CRAZY COOL SONG MAKES ME WANT TO DANCE REAL FAST HOLY SHIT!

      I seriously need to tape my life. I've realized that I do some really weird, messed up things when I'm by myself. Ex: suddenly getting up and yelling at Ricki Lake. Of course, she couldn't hear me as she was in the tv. I also, really think that they should invent something to record your thoughts. Like do you ever have those times where you completely zone out and start thinking about the coolest things but like when you snap out of your little day-dream, you can't remember what you were thinking. That happens ALL THE TIME to me.  I just don't make sense anymore. I don't know if it's out of laziness or stupidity, but I just can't explain things the way I mean it anymore. Maybe it's because Im out of school so my thoughts aren't all straight. Oh well.

           I just got home from a little town of Shelburne (a.k.a. Butt Fuck Nowhere.) Population=4 000. I was there to visit my buddy Kim and Leeanne and Danielle came too. (Danielle is Leeanne's 12 year old sister, she's cool.) We spent most of the weekend drunk with these 2 guys Dan and Shane, that we met. It was Fiddlefest up there... Yes, 'Fiddlefest'. It should have been called 'Come to our tiny town and get drunk-fest'. But yes, it was all in good fun. So here I am now, with slightly less brain cells, listening to A.F.I. and thinking about all the stupid shit I did. Like walking into a screen door, falling numerous times, skateboarding and running into things and hiding from the cops. There's so much more but I can't remember it. I couldn't even remember what this site was. I also couldn't remember the difference between a Koala and a Panda bear. I also tried to convince my mom to get a trampoline out of boredom. It didn't work. Hmm... I need to regain lost knowledge.  Aww shit, I can't get rid of this bold font, I tried one of those keyboard shortcuts. Oh well, too lazy. Mmm, food.

           Today, I woke up at 2:00 pm. Considering I don't sleep in that much, that's pretty late. I was so tired and probably could have slept for longer if my stupid brother and his friend Ryan weren't yelling downstairs. Like holy crap, don't they realize that some people are sleeping at 2 in the afternoon! I was about to throw something, but then I figured I probably wouldn't be able to go back to sleep anyways.       I have a new found obbsession with "Eels". They are THE greatest band "That's Not Really Funny" is the greatest song : D. So now, thanks to my brother once again, I have to turn my music up SUPER loud so I can hear over, "What's up mah nigga, Shut up nigga!" But I guess this is the price I have to pay for being born into the wrong family.       Well,  Amy's gone to her trailer for the week, Kylie is babysitting, Laura's mom scares me and all of my other "peeps" are most likely busy. Hm. That leaves me left with nothing to do. If only I had money, I could buy people to hang out with. Or at least something interesting to do. Like a trampoline - alone or not, it's ALWAYS fun.

           I might as well start this whole thing off by talking about myself. Hmm... I live in a town with people and there's nothing fun to do here. My mom is crazy, my brother is annoying (note: he IS older than me) and my "dad" lives in a far off land of nowhere-ness. I'm a normal kid and I do semi-normal stuff. I like to have fun and be crazy. I really like taking pictures. Pictures of cool things, not like flowers and shit. I have 3 cats with a collective Cat IQ of 7. I also have a dog, he's inbread so he's a little messed up, but he's still cool. I can't think of anything else to say about myself at the moment.       Today was a boring, slow day. I watched a 10 hour marathon of some messed up show. It was interesting for the first 3 hours but then it just started going downhill. It made me think about the human race and I came to a conclusion. Humans are GREEDY! People will do anything for money. Like what was the last thing you did for 5 bucks? Run down a street naked, eat a worm, make out with your best friend infront of a bunch of guys... This is nothing compared do what these people were doing, not only to themselves but to one another. I know if I made it out of that show alive I would never believe anyone again. There's lies and decieving all at the cost of someone else. These people would go to any length for $100 000, including hurting a lot of other people on the way. It's almost ridiculous. All I can say is the Karma Gods will get those people back... BAD! MUAHAHA!
