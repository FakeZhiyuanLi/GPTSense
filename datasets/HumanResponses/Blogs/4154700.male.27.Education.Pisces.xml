      Erika came over the other night with a bag full of exotic foods. After having spent the summer in Paris and Vietnam, she was ready to try her hand at making a spring roll. (The one thing I didn't quite get was that she had the "Vietnamese spring roll" while in Paris. Oh well, maybe it's not for me to understand). They were so good, I had to take a picture of them! It's attached below. Nice work, E.K. I spent the first part of this past week in conferences for the semester forthcoming. Talk about a waste of time. I got no new information and at one point I got out of my chair and went to the front of the room to rescue a PROFESSOR from his own presentation. Why do I even bother to attend these things? Every year I'm promised something new and important and every year the only thing new I get is a hemorrhoid! I did leave early on Wednesday to go to Miami and pick up Chiara from the airport. Her roommate and fellow countrywoman, Silvia, drove. See, Silvia and Chiara bought a car but neither of them have ever driven in the US. Silvia wanted to prove to herself that she could make it to Miami and back. I though this was a good idea until I found out that we would be traveling during rush hour. Silvia insisted. So she drove and I tried to be patient in the passenger seat. (I must have felt like Nicole felt when she spent the summer with us in Spring Mills. Every time I went to stop, Nicole would slam her foot into the floorboard, as if, by some divine intervention, she had control over the break. Well, I too wished for that divine control). Alas, we made it safely there and back again -- (Hobbit reference for those of you that knows it). The biggest problem we suffered was that Chiara had two pairs of shoes stolen from her luggage. Italian shoes must be hot items on the black market. more later t

      ... And so ends my week of freedom. This past week brought some excitement to Florida with the arrival of Bonnie and Charlie. According to today's news, there are two more hurricanes in the Atlantic gaining strength. While we didn't get much weather from the storms, we did manage to have at least one exciting storm and some trees on campus were blown over. Speaking of campus, I will be starting back to school informally this week with organizational meeting and will go "full-force" next week with the arrival of the entire student body. As it stands now, I'm teaching three sections of writing at BCC on tuesday and thursday and one section of writing at FAU on monday, wed, and friday. The three PhD courses for which I am registered all meet at 4 pm on Mon, Tues, and Wed. To me, this sounds like an insane schedule. I'll be grading papers for over 100 students while trying to do my own research and writing. Oh well, someone's gotta pay the rent :-) The good news is that BCC has offered its adjunct instructors a small rise this semester. Mr Emerson and Nyla have displayed a significant change in behavior. I think he has figured out that the other cat is a SHE. Colleen and I often find him standing over her, biting her neck, and Nyla screaming! After this dance, they both start rubbing against anything and everything. My poor neutered kitty. (Incidently, Nyla is not spayed) Chiara comes back to Florida this week. I'm excited to have my friends all back in town, although she has already lamented the fact that she will be leaving her niece and nephew behind in Sicily. Speaking of nieces and nephews, I got the good news this past week that I'll be an uncle to for another male Houser. Congratulations Nathan and Kylie. I'm excited for him to arrive. And I'm super thrilled to be coming home to see my family for the wedding. I've been soooooo homesick this summer. A wedding will be a great place to catch up with the people whom I miss and love. Ok, I'm off to the beach to enjoy a slightly overcast sunday -- the last relaxing one for a semester, at least. t

      Today was my official last day of teaching for the summer.  I spent 3 hours at BCC and submitted the final grades.  It is big relief to be looking at a two week hiatus.  What I should really do is find another job; paying rent for two places is terrible!  It's only for a month, though.  Besides, no one hires people for 2 weeks on purpose. Friday night I went out with a group of FAU people to say "goodbye" to Jamie.  She is leaving for Michigan State Univ. on Wednesday.  It was a cute little Irish pub in Hollywood (Florida) with a great jazz band.  On Saturday I made the Turkey meatloaf recipe that Jane sent me.  It was AWESOME!  (I'm enjoying being a cook --  It is less depressing to cook for two).  On Sunday I got up and went to church at a church I found close by the new house.  As it turns out, when I first moved here I visited the church with Heidi and Shane for one of Ali's school plays.  Because I was new to the area, I had no idea where we were.  When I drove past the church last week, I realized that I had been there and decided to go to the 11am service.  If you want to see about the church it has a web page (you can even listen to the service!):  www.victory.org I enjoyed it and think I shall attend in the near future. I have another picture that I'll post.  It's a cute shot of Mr. E and Nyla,  I call it "Patience and Fortitude II." more later t

      My friend Scotty G set up a blog for Sally (she's off to Egypt) and I thought: Cool!!! I gotta have one too!  I figured it would be a great way for me to keep everyone posted on what is happening with me and, perhaps, guilt some of you whom I don't see as often as I would like into keeping in touch with me. (Read: What's up PA family and friends?) Today I'll start with some pictures of my new house.  I was looking for a one-bedroom apartment in Boca but couldn't afford it.  So my friend, Colleen, and I combined forces and are living in a house!!!  Within the first week, someone stole the radio from my car and broke into the neighbor's house -- maybe a one bedroom in the ghetto would have been a better idea.  In a strange way, we are the "typical American family:"  Two cats and a dog who join us on the sofa when we sit down to watch "our shows" on TV in the evening. (I'm really out of touch with pop-culture.  Why do I not consider this a bad thing?) I guess that's it for now, I'm off to teach. more later, t
