        Oh my FUCKING GOD  !      If ONE more thing happens tonight I'm going to   FUCKING KILL   SOMEONE! No, it's not enough that I have to deal with shit from day to bastard day, now it gets ten times  FUCKING WORSE! I've had about as much as I can take, and I am on the edge. One more person pisses me off...and I will flip! I mean it...I will actually go fucking nuts. Yeah, I was upset earlier...ready to cry but now I'm listening to Eminem and it's making me fucking angry. I feel sorry for everyone in this shithole of a house because pretty soon I'm gonna snap and go on a rampage! Hey, who knows...maybe I'll smash the house up again and get the fucking POLICE on my back like last time...FUN!   I haven't felt like this since December, and I'm actually scared incase I go back to how I used to be. I don't think I could handle all that shit again, but I recognize these feelings and I recognize this mood. I don't wanna go off of the rails again but I can't control my anger! There's seriously something wrong with me. Basically what's happened is I've now got another personal fucking stalker, I've been in another fucking fight today, argued with me mum, Nikki ain't talking to me and every fucker's bein funny with me. And not forgetting Shane who keeps pissing me off about James n won't stop until I set him up with my sister .  If there was a random person here with no identity n no family and stood infront of me shouting "Hey! Leanne, kill me!" I fucking wouldn't hesitate. But unfortunatley those kinda people don't exist. Therefore I am forced to sit in this   WANK   of a life hoping and praying that some day the constant and endless   SHIT   that I have to deal with will some day come to an end. Obviously it won't because I'm not that lucky...and God hates me...   Yeah...so fuck the little miss   FUCKING SUNSHINE   that everyone wants me to be...I'm sick of it! I'm sick of people, I'm sick of myself and I'm sick of life. But at the moment I'd rather kill others than myself...that's gotta be good right?   I can't believe I feel like this! This is the old Leanne and I don't wanna go back to the old Leanne! She hurts people, she's selfish and she's evil. She shoplifts, she smashes things up, she manipulates people and fucks up their lives, she gets the police foned on her, she cuts herself and she's full of hate. She's more trouble than she's worth...   Hopefully I'll feel better tomorrow, infact I'm actually praying to God that I do...otherwise I'm fucked Have a nice   FUCKING   day everyone

       My head's full of thought, Thoughts of you. And I'm distracted so easy, Thinking what to do, So unsure, so unfamiliar, Am I wrong to think that something could happen?    Will you fall for me, I need to know, the way I'd like you to, Baby, will you fall for me, The way I've fallen for you.    Im not like myself, And I'm playing the role of someone else, And my hearts beating so fast, I can't stop it. And Im so unsure, So unfamiliar, Am I wrong to think that something could happen?    Will you fall for me, The way I'd like you to, Will you fall for me, The way I've fallen for you.    Fallen for, fallen for you  For you...

        Bonjour Mes Copines!    Yes, that's right babies, this has been my second day as a 16-year-old! And it pissed it down all day =( Yesterday was the most amazing birthday I'd ever had. I stayed up until 12.30 with Len while he wished me a happy birthday (many times) =D Then finally went to bed! I woke up that morning at about 11am (Yes...4 hours too early for me) and was in the happiest mood I'd ever been in! (Even happier than that random day last year in History when I literally fell off of my chair and banged my head on the corner of the table with laughter, and I can't even remember what I was laughing at =\)   I woke up, put on my dressing gown and walked downstairs expecting to be bombarded with "HAPPY BIRTHDAY"'s from my family but nobody was in. I soon got over it. I wacked the TV on, flicked over to the music channels and turned it up  FULL BLAST!  Then I danced around like a motherfucker for about an hour before Nikki came over to give me my card. I still wasn't dressed! We had a little chat and talked about Chris's car...Snazzay!=D Nikki had handmade me this gorgeous blue card, it was amazing! I don't know if it's just me but I think handmade cards are alot more personal than store bought ones. That's why I was so happy when she gave it to me.   After Nikki had gone, Kirsty gave me my card. She'd been hiding upstairs for about an hour making it. She'd glittered it up and put a little plastic bottle of champagne inside. I laughed my ass off, but I'll keep those cards forever.   Then mum came home and gave me my card from her & Nidhal (she'd signed it from him but...whatever)...I opened it and discovered £40! Wow...I'm rich! Then Nidhal came home from work and gave me a tenner. He apologised for not buying me a gift...but all I wanted was the money.   My mum then asked me (on my god damn BIRTHDAY) to wash the dishes, but I was in such a good mood, I thought; fuck it, I'll do them! My response was; "HELL YEAH I'LL WASH THE DISHES!"   So...I washed them, still in my pyjamas, while dancing around to Outkast-Roses! I go crazy whenever that song comes on, I swear! Then my aunty and my nanna came around and gave me my presents. I was a little shocked to see my nanna after all of that shit that went on between us, but fuck it...it's in the past now!   My aunty gave me a gorgeous watch (which is handy because I needed a new one) and a new make-up set (which is handy because I REALLY needed that!) My nanna gave me 20 L&B, a tenner and a golden dolphin necklace with real diamonds in it...I went crazy!   By then, I still wasn't dressed. My aunty and nanna left and then it was  PARTY TIME BABY!  At 7pm, I met Shelley, Rich, Faye, Kerry, Leigh-Anne, Liam, Vinni &amp; Zoë around at Rich's and Shelley gave me my card from her, Zoë, Kerry and Leigh-Anne. I'd stupidly worn my heels even though I knew we were going down the meadows so Shelley and I legged it back to mine so that I could change into my trainers. We ran back around to meet everyone else and Rich went to buy the booze. Shelley bought me a bottle of Irn Brew VK and I spazzed out. I was just so unbelievably happy!   Then we went down the meadows and sat around drinking in the rain for about two hours. There were some lads that none of us knew, they were about 12 and they kept hogging the rope swing. Shelley (one of the nicest people I know) eventually got pissed out of her face and started ripping these 12-year-olds. "Why ya sittin'in the tree? Are ya watchin' for pirates?". Shelley and Zoë were being evil to the kids, but then Grant and Briggsy came down and started playfighting with one of the kids. But then they made his head bleed...so they stopped!   I pissed myself with laughing down the meadows! It was so much fun! Grant, Liam and Briggsy borrowed my lighter and started a fire in the forest. There was so much fucking smoke but no fire!   It was pissing it down so we all took off up to the Vanish. Rich and us girls went into the Vanish and played pool! All of us girls were being eyed up by some perv sitting in the corner. Zoë and Leigh-Anne went home and so did Faye, so Rich, Kerry, Shelley and me went to stand in the bus stop out of the rain. Grant, Vinni and Liam were all standing in the opposite bus stop so they came and joined us.   They spent ages quoting lines from Snatch, Shelley, Kerry and me were proper bored! Then fucking DICKHEAD Chris appeared out of nowhere and started talking about the time that Laura gave him a blow-job in the middle of the street. Grant saw and ran over to Shelley's screaming   "SHELLEY! LET ME IN...OH MY FUCKING GOD SHELLEY LET ME IN!"   he he   Anyways, then the 737 to Chesterfield came past and Briggsy dared Grant to prank the bus driver. Grant stuck out his hand and when the bus pulled over Grant looked in and said "Allr8 youth, when's the last bus?"..."11.00"..."Allrite then...thanks...bye!"    He deserved it! He's a bus driver!    Yeah, so then I went home and came on MSN for a while...then I took residence in my lovely bed!=D   Woke up this morning to find that Len had txted me! YEY! Got a bit excited there =P Did my History exam this morning, fun =\...then went shopping with Bex for my birthday present! Got a gorgeous bag and purse! Thanks Bexieeeeee   Hehe, I think I've said more than enough =P Asta xXx

        OH YES!    Yeaaah! It's my birthday dude! Aww, I'm sweet 16 today and have now become legal for a few activities...if you get me ;)   I've had THE most amazing night in ages! I met Len &amp; Rik at the bus station at 5.30 and we went to Rileys. I felt really sorry for Rik because he was ill and looked kinda tired, but he didn't look as ill as the woman that Len showed me on the wall *shudders*. Anyways, Rik went home and I was like "Aww, bless him!" Played pool with Len and the bitch thrashed me every time! =( hehe, he should think before he talks..."Don't get your boobs on my balls!" LMAO   Yeah...so we had to go at 7.30 because it's like "No Kids" time ain't it? So we walked up to Clumber street and just sat on the floor and talked for ages while we watched the mansfield scutters walked past. Still haven't thought of a name for them yet...hmm...   Then we walked down to the Chinese but it was closed =\...so then we walked up Sammy's street and the lil year 8 that I wagged school with was hanging out of her bedroom window shouting "Is that your boyfriend?"..."No!"..."Stop lyin'"..."I'm not,"...."Stop lyin'"...I was like, yeah...go back to bed!   Then we went down Titch n had a chat about Colley *spits*...then we walked to the bus station and he gave me 40p for the bus that I didn't need. Now I feel bad and I might buy him a Sausage Roll to make up for it =P   Yeeey! This has been like the best birthday EVER! Okay...gonna go and be 16 now, mwah xXx

        Forced to sit in this endless hell, Taking it in, Trying to remain sane, Nothing is going to get me out of here, I can feel myself going crazy again.    I sit and force myself to smile somehow, Trying harder to push the pain away, Braving the torture like the girl I was, Living to fight another 'perfect' day.     They see the girl I'm trying to be, All they see are the lies, They don't see the girl who bleeds Or the girl that cries inside.    So tell me what can I do to make you see, That what you're seeing ain't really me, What can I do to make you realize, There's torture behind these pretty blue eyes.    What can I do to make you believe, That you never knew the real me, What can I do to make you realize, There's torture behind these pretty blue eyes.    These cigarettes burn down so fast, Alcohol doesn't soothe the pain, I've been down every road, Tried it all And now I'm back to square one again.    I've searched so long for a perfect high, Something to try and wash away the shame, No matter what I do to change my life, Everything always seems to stay the same.    They see the girl I'm trying to be, All they see are the lies, They don't see the girl who bleeds Or the girl that cries inside.    So tell me what can I do to make you see, That what you're seeing ain't really me, What can I do to make you realize, There's torture behind these pretty blue eyes.    What can I do to make you believe, That you never knew the real me, What can I do to make you realize, There's torture behind these pretty blue eyes.

       Today turned out to be better than I had expected. At 12.00 I was woken up by the sound of my phone ringing,I finally discovered that it was Jade after she stopped crying. I'd just woken up and couldn't quite process what she was saying but she sounded upset and asked me to meet her in town, so I did.   I met up with her at 1.30 and she told me what was wrong. Apparantly Luke was being a twat again and said some un-called-for things to her the night before. They were both hammered at the time though, but there was still no need for what he said.   Jade and I walked around town for a while and I walked her halfway home while we wrapped our arms around eachother and sang like drunken pissheads.   I caught the bus home, only to discover that I'd been locked out and everyone had pissed off to Mansfield, oh the irony! I went around to Vinnis to see if I could crash there for a bit but nobody answered the door. I totally refused to sit outside in the freezing cold and wait for everyone to get back, so I made a   plan.   I grabbed the ladder from the side of the house and propped it against the living room window which happened to be open. I tried to climb through the window and failed, and my new neighbours called the police because they thought I was breaking in! Perfection....   7.30 came around quick and Richard called for me. To be honest I was totally dreading going out since the last time Richard called for me. Richard, Shelly, Liam and me ended up sitting in Liam's new jeep with the windows wound down blasting sixties tunes through the speakers. Liam can't legally drive yet so he just drove up and down Richard's drive, intentionally destroying all of his dad's garden plants. XD   A load of us went down the meadows and messed about on the rope swing. It suited me down to the ground because Zoe had a load of fags that she needed to get rid of before she went home, so she ended up crashing them out to everyone.   It was absolutley freezing so we all decided to make a fire by setting fire to a bunch of paper with Rich's lighter. It didn't last too long though! We were being rained on so everyone decided to walk back up to the village. On the way there, walking through the fields, Shelly jumped on Richard's back and he carried her through. I asked what she was doing and she said that she didn't want to get attacked by snakes or rats.   This statement obviously made me squeal and start pegging it as fast as I could through the fields like a retard. That's the joy of being me I suppose.   Richard and Shelly walked me home, I got in and a few hours later I started talking to Len and managed to piss him off. Hopefully he won't hate me for too long. That's all for tonight children

       I've had about as much as I can actually take. I'd give myself a few more days in this house and then I'll snap. As for my previous entry (scared about going back to the old me) I think we're past that now! That isn't an issue anymore, because it's already happened. Yes...welcome back the bitch... The other night, my mum said she was gonna go and pick me up some cigarettes from the shop. She was going out with my stepdad, my sister and my grandad you see...and she said she would fetch me some fags before she went. So my stepdad, my sister and her got in the car...and I waited, waited and   WAITED   my fucking   ASS   off and she never came back! Whn I finally realised that she wasn't gonna return with some fags, I started to get very edgy. I dipped into the bottle of vodka that nobody knows about that's hidden in my bedroom and had a bit too much. I knew that Kirsty had been dropped off at my nanna's, so I dialed the number and waited for an answer;       Nanna:    Hello?    Me:    Hello...is me mum there?     Nanna:    Is that Leanne?    Me:    Yer    Nanna:   No she's gone out I think, why what do you want her for?    Me:    What do you mean "you think"? she's either gone out or she hasn't   Nanna:   What do you want her for?    Me:    Is Kirsty there?   Nanna:   Yer    Me:    Can you put her on the fone please?!   Nanna:   Hang on!    Kirsty:    Hello?    Me:    Has mum gone out?    Kirsty:    Yeah...    Me:     {hangs up}    After hanging up, I threw the phone across the room, smashing it to pieces. I then smashed up the entire house, including my bedroom. I started to trash the living room and came across a picture of my father that my mum had hidden in the drawer. When I'm in that state, the last face I want to see is my father's. This made me angrier, I started to scream my head off. I started screaming some shit about "How the fuck am I meant to deal with this shit alone..." I don't really remember, but it was just some random shit. I picked up the remote control and threw it against the wall, shattering it. I smashed everything that was in my way. After smashing something made of glass, I saw sharp glittering pieces of broken glass. I picked a piece up and tried to hack at my arms with it. About 30 seconds later, the phone rang. It was my nanna. She heard me crying and could tell that I was a little drunk. She talked to me for a while &amp; convinced me to chew some nicorette gum to calm me down (because she was convinced that my motive for smashing up the house was my craving for a fag, when in fact it was the thought that my mother had once again let me down). She also convinced me to clean up the house before my mother came home to save me from about a week of bullshit from her. I cannot usually be talked to when I'm in that mood. I'm either getting better or I'm about to get worse. Either way, I have nobody. I'm use to it. I'll make it alone...

       Because I haven't! Not in a long while!   I am actually going crazy in this house, but Kirsty's got it ten times harder! She's in the house 24/7, she has to put up with this bullshit day in, day out. Luckily I can escape for a while to my mates' houses but Kirsty can't. She's always been close to my mum, I've always been the independent one, which is why this must be rougher on Kirst than it is on me. I think tonight made her snap, I walked past her and saw her bottom lip wobbling and knew that something was up. I followed her into the living room where she collapsed onto the chair with her head in her hands crying her heart out. I know we don't get along much, but she's my baby sister and I couldn't just let her sit and cry with nobody to talk to, because I've done it and I know how it feels to be alone.   I managed to calm her down a bit and she told me what was wrong. It's my mum's birthday tomorrow and Kirsty wanted to make it special, so while I was over at Vinni's she asked my mum if she would drive her to Tescos (not telling her it was for ingredients for her cake). My mum said she'd take her at about 6pm. 6pm came and my mum told Kirsty that she was too tired to drive her, she needed a few hours sleep...so she'd take her at 8.30 instead. At 8.00 Kirsty went to wake up mum and mum said that she was getting up. Then at 8.15 Kirsty went to get her up again, and she was still asleep. 8.30pm came around and mum was in bed messing about with her prick of a husband. The dog was next to my mum, and he intentionally scared the dog. Therefore...dog jumps on mother, scratches mother in eye, mother then becomes too "ill" to take Kirsty to Tescos. Fair enough...just broken your daughter's heart but nevermind. If you can't keep the promises that you make...don't make them in the first place...simple as that! So Kirsty and I made a cake from what we could find in the cupboard, it turned out to be a lemon cake, basically a sponge slathered in lemon curd! It wasn't what Kirsty had hoped for, and she didn't think it was good enough, and she blamed herself.   Neither her or I have any money, and my mother knows that we can't afford to buy her a present at the moment, but apparantly she still sits there bragging to Kirst about how her husbands gonna buy her a diamond ring for her birthday. And how the fuck exactly is he gonna do that? When he's basically an asylum seeker on minimum wage who got laid off today? Smells like bullshit to me...   But even if it isn't bullshit, why would she sit there and tell Kirsty that? Why? Because she wanted to intentionally make Kirsty feel like shit for not buying her anything, That's fucking why. Kirsty also told me that my mum won't let her buy our dad a card for father's day. We're not allowed to visit his grave anymore either. She can fuck off if she thinks that's happening. She has NO right whatsoever to stop us from visiting our dad, and I'll be DAMNED if she's gonna try and prevent us from doing so. She's already taken down every picture of him in the house and thrown them in a cupboard because her new husband is uncomfortable with them being up. Just because she's cut my father out of her memory doesn't mean that Kirsty and I have to!   While I sat and hugged Kirsty and listened to her spill her heart out to me, I realised that we aren't that different afterall. We're sisters yeah, but we've never been really close, probably because she's always been joined to my mum at the hip. I told Kirsty that she had to turn this negative thing into a positive. Even though we're both being constantly let down by our mum, neglected even... she has to use this as a way to gain more independence. She has to become stronger from this, rather than weaker...   Tonight, for the first time in my life, I actually felt like a big sister. While I listened to Kirsty pouring out her heart, trying to fight back the tears, I realised just how much this was affecting her, how much she hates Nidhal and how much my mother is breaking her heart with no remorse.   All I can say now, is hold on babez, cos this shit won't last forever, I know you're hurtin' as much as I am but this will end someday. You'll get stronger and you'll be able to get through this. We've both had alot of shit in our lives that we didn't deserve, and I respect you so much for pulling through it, even though I don't show it. I know that every time they have an argument, it gets taken out on us...and I know that you think about running away, but don't. Don't leave me with them...ARRGGHHH =(   Seriously though, I love you to bits, don't let them get to you Kirsty cos you're stronger than that! Mwah x Oh yeah...and happy fucking birthday mum...enjoy your cake...

       Today I signed into MSN not expecting an argument. I started to talk to a long-time friend of mine, Paul. Paul and I have been talking over MSN for four years. Even though we have never met eachother in person, we were still close and I counted him as a friend none-the-less.    Recently Paul has become quite cocky and seems to have transformed into a raging arse-hole. Today Paul invited me to start sending webcam. I accepted and the webcam displayed me and my boyfriend sitting at the computer. To cut a long-story short, Paul was particularly nasty and sarcastic towards my boyfriend and I, and at one point referred to my boyfriend as a "nigger".   At first I was in shock fom what he had said. But later, I decided to confront him about his dickhead-ness. This is how it went....       Lèna:     my god Paul fellows you really have become an annoying, petty, racist little fucker haven't you?    Paul:     Hmmmm     Paul:      not wot I was expecting...wuda preferred a hello Lèna:  I'm not amused. Using sarcasm as a way to defend yourself is pretty fucking pathetic.    Paul:     wow    Paul:     k    Paul:     there was a time when u cud take a joke, evidently that time has passed Lèna:  Trust me, I can take a joke. I didn't want to say anything in front of my boyfriend, which is why I didn't bring this up earlier. But what you said was pretty fucking nasty     Lèna:     and bang out of order    Paul:     :/ everyone else can handle it coz they know I aint racist    Lèna:     that's a fucking contradiction if ever I've heard one...    Paul:     Jesus mother fucking Christ get off Ur hig horse woman. it was a comment that was not meant to be taken seriously, everyone else realises it except u. ur problem. Deal wivi t.    Paul:     *high    Lèna:     No Paul, everyone else doesn't realise it. You pretty much fucked off everyone in the room I was sitting in when you made that comment. I ain't on a high horse; I'm just not a racist self-righteous prick such as yourself. I don't know exactly WHAT issue you have with me, but I suggest you sort it out and get the fuck over it. During our previous conversation every word you typed was dripping with sarcasm, you picked fault with almost everything I either said or did. You USED to be an all right lad.... and I emphasise *USED TO BE* But lately you seem to have transformed into nothing less than a complete twat.    Paul:     lol ok    Lèna:     wow, what a response. Jesus mother fucking Christ Paul, you really know how to defend yourself don't you? You REALLY know how to back up what you say with a dignified reason! I'm stuck for words now, you've really gob smacked me with such a witty response. Grow the fuck up Paul, stop being such a fucking knob and get your act together. Because one day you're going to piss off the wrong person, it's inevitable, especially for a racist homophobic fucker like you    Paul:     I actually am quite amazed..this is quite an assualt ur making. the reason i aint defending myself is coz i aint really bothered. i wud defend myself against u if i actually gave a fuck    Lèna:     that's your problem isn't it sweetheart, you don't give a fuck about anyone but yourself    Paul:     there r many ppl that i give a fuck about..however u arent really one of them    Lèna:     oh, I presume that was your half assed attempt at an insult?    Paul:     no    Paul:     simply a statement    Paul:     if I wanted to waste my time insulting someone ill neva meet then i wud, however i fail to see the point    Lèna:     Isn't that what you were doing earlier? Insulting two people you've never met and will never meet?    Paul:     woteva u said i probably missed it due to msn failure    Lèna:     Then for your own benefit, I'll repeat myself    Lèna:     Isn't that what you were doing earlier? Insulting two people you've never met and will never meet?    Paul:     I don’t really remember much about before..i remember hats and thats about it    Lèna:     Why do I get the feeling that you're avoiding answering my question because you know that you can't?    Paul:     I don’t know, why r u getting that feeling?    Lèna:     Aww look, Paul is once again using sarcasm as a defence mechanism    Paul:     ok     Lèna:     I know for a fact you can remember that conversation, I KNOW that you can't answer my question. And YOU know (and if you don't, you should) that a 19-year-old MAN who cannot defend himself against a 16-year-old GIRL is pretty fucking weak.     Lèna:    don't you agree?    Paul:     I haven’t been bothering to "defend" myself against u    Paul:     if u said summat that bothered me, i might be tempted    Lèna:     To be honest Paul, you're bound to say that aren't you? You can't put up a decent argument and therefore use the *can't be bothered* card. You're making out that you have better things to do, well it's quite fucking low that you didn't have better things to do earlier than insult me and my boyfriend. Now that you've been confronted you're basically being a pussy and backing out PRETENDING you have better things to do than defending yourself and the things you say. Anyone can insult someone, but insulting someone and then being too much of a PUSSY to stand up for what you said is absolutely fucking PATHETIC    Paul:     where did i say i have better things to do then?    Paul:     I simply said i cudnt be bothered. whether u choose to believe that is entirelly ur choice and something i dont really care about. ur making this a big deal not me, u care about it not me    Lèna:     Hopefully this *Tina* will realise what a fucking dick you really are and will therefore save herself a lifetime of fucking misery and finish you. That is...if *Tina* actually exists, because let's face it, you're not exactly a chick magnet are you darlin?    Paul:     nice ploy there, trying to get a rise out of me..almost succeeded so dont stop trying    Lèna:     oh what a shame, because I'd hate for you to actually use up all of your precious energy creating a decent argument. To be honest, that shows how much you *love* this so-called *Tina*. And I don't know if it was just me but I don't actually recall you denying her non-existence    Lèna:     I hope for her sake that she is imaginary    Paul:     believe she is imaginary if u want..makes little difference to me    Paul:     I don’t need to have ur belief or disbelief..either way i care little    Lèna:     Well darlin', if she's real...give her my sympathy! Because it sounds like she fucking needs it.    Paul:     will do    Paul:     ill give her the sympathy of someone she will neva meet and/or give a fuck about    Lèna:     I'd appreciate that...thank you    Paul:     no problem
