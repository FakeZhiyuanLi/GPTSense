      Wow, I love having my car worked on... well, at least I did today.  I even had my dad with me.  We take it in and the Trasnmission mechanic comes to talk to me to clarify the "noise" that I am hearing...  He then tells me how nice it was to meet me.  My dad about fell out of his chair when he walked away.  I simply looked at my dad and said, "what?"...  "No mechanic ever told me, 'it was so nice to meet you'"...  The rest of my experience at the car dealership was equally as ego boosting.  The mechanic (his name is James by the way...love those shirts with the names on them) asks me to come outside to clarify the "noise" b/c he thinks it is really 2 things that are wrong.  "Gladly, you little hottie" I think to myself.  What a pleasant experience...  Before I leave he reassures me that they will take good care of me and "fix it up"........of course he was referring to my car and I was NOT thinking about my car's transmission at all... I think I told him at least 3 times that I would be back on Monday to drop it off...  (to be continued)

      Random title...I decided to get caught up on my country music videos tonight and ended up watching a documentary on Nascar.  Don't get me wrong, I know there are people who love it...great for them.  Personally, I don't get it.  Then again, I am the girl who takes my car in and says "it is making a funny noise" they say "under the hood" I say, "sure, I'm guessing that is where it is coming from."  Hence, I don't get cars nor the fun in Nascar.  Any who, there was this little kid, age approx 7 that said, "It's all I've known...Racin'" and I thought to myself, that kid will be in my classroom in 5 years...hmmmmm    So in an attempt to make my life more healthy I have decided to work out nightly beginning past 9 pm.  Why then?  I have no idea, but no other time of day has seemed to work and as my behind is expanding...I decided to try anything.  I walked 2 miles on the treadmill, spent 10 minutes on the stairmaster and did the "innies & outies" leg machine.  As a result it is 12:15am and I'm wide awake.  Doesn't matter though b/c...I do not have to wake up to an alarm...AHHHH one of the great perks of my profession.  Note:  in 5 years I will have toteach the "it's all I've known...Racin'" kid the fundamental principles of the Constitution (I deserve the break, damnit)

      On Sunday I went to a beautiful joining of lives ceremony (aka a wedding).  It was such a perfect representation of a Christian union.  The sermon spoke about God's expectations of the man and woman in marriage.  The most profound was not what I learned about my role as a woman.  I know what God expects from me...and I know that it will be a great challenge (being an active Christian is not meant to be an easy job).  The most profound thing I realized was God's gift to me in my future husband.  The man is supposed to cherish, adore, and love me (just as I am).  God tells men that they are to love their wives like Christ loved the church...now, that is LOVE.  I have had the desire to be loved (like any normal human being) and I have even spoken the words, "I want to be cherished"...in the past I felt selfish about this.  However, after the wedding ceremony on Sunday, I realized that I was not being selfish...I was having the longing that God has placed in my heart for a very important reason.  He put it there b/c He intents on fulfilling it.  Then I started thinking back on my past relationships.  I do not "settle" and I have very high standards...but why?  Hmmm...  I realized night before last that I have high expectations b/c I have a model to look back on.  I have been adored, and cherished once (in an adult relationship...I had a similar one in High School but life is so different as an adult that I don't think of the HS one as a model)...  Here goes:  I have spent the past 4 years of my life searching for my match.  I have been dead wrong multiple times.  I have been right once, but was not willing to admit it to myself or the world.  Why not?  because it wasn't "perfect" in my mind.  The man who was my match was 18 years older than me.  I was 23 and he was 41.  We knew each other for one year and really we only had contact for 7 months.  Of those 7 months we had 3 "dating" months.  That sounds very complicated...I met him in one of my college classes in the Spring semester.  So we met in January, started "dating" in April, stopped dating in early July and he passed away the next January.  He died of esophagus cancer.  He was diagnosed in March of 2001 and died January 2, 2002.  We stopped dating in July because of my inability to handle the disease.  However, I do not "beat myself" up about it.  I have peace that he knew that I loved him...I don't want to relish in the sad parts...instead I want to dwell in the blissful moments (though they were brief)...  Jon was the kindest man I have ever known.  My memories are not in chronological order...so I'm not going to try to recreate our entire relationship...  I'm going to ramble (after all it is what I do best)...he loved to take walks...everytime I went to his house he insisted that I bring my dog, not b/c he wanted to see her but because he knew that I felt guilty leaving her at home, he bought a toy for her to keep at his house...I love skittles, he always had them on hand at his house...I also love Nilla wafers, also always on hand at his house...he loved my random habit of sitting on the counter tops in the kitchen while I watched him cook...we watched Tora, Tora, Tora together at least two times (remember, I'm a history teacher)...during finals I was at his house studying and decided to take a nap, he woke me with a gentle kiss and sat on the bed for 20 minutes and watched me sleep (I wasn't ready to wake up)...he watched my fashion show of outfits to wear to my first job interview...he took me to see Moulin Rouge, then bought me the soundtrack b/c I loved it so much...he had a single rose delivered to his office the day I got my job offers so when I picked him up for lunch he would have a rose to give me...we talked, he listened and didn't combat every opinion that I have...he was simply incredible.  The last time I spoke to him was on September 11.  He was a former history teacher and I was a first year history teacher.  I needed him to comfort me and guide me.  He did that by simply saying, "I know that you will handle the students' fears, questions and concerns with grace because that is who you are."  I was wanting more of a step by step what to do, but like always he made me find the strength in myself.    Now, that is true love.  That is what I was searching for...and I didn't realize that I found it because I couldn't get over the 18 years that he was on this earth before me.  The irony is that I have several years to spend on this earth where he has completed his time here.    Why is it that we all search for things that are often right infront of our face?

      That's right ladies and gents....Sean will be here in less than 5 hours.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH  Ok, now that I got that out of my system.  I am going to list possible scenarios for this weekend: 1.  Everything goes beyond perfectly...he leaves on Sunday being helplessly in love with me.  We plan the next 5 times that we will see each other and he tells me that I am the wind beneath his wings. (little cheesey but it is nice regardless)  2.  Things go well today b/c I haven't seen him in 2 years...and we are giddy.  Tomorrow I wake up and realize that he has not matured and he will definitely leave me "high and dry" again.    3.  I fall helplessly in love with him and he tells me that I am still "too old" for him.  He pretends while he is here that he might actually consider the idea of "dating" me, but calls me on Monday and tells me that it isn't going to work out.  4.  We fly to Vegas and get married.  Yikes, I think the only one that I could stand would be #1.  I am still at the point of "go ahead, break my heart if you must...just give me one night of bliss."  The "bliss" that I am talking about has nothing to do with sex.  It is way more intimate than sex...  It is the mutual respect, adoration and love that allows you to drift to sleep in someone else's arms without any other thoughts or anxieties running around in your head.    I now have to go clean my room, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen (note:  roommate's pot of black beans from 3 weeks ago is still not clean...it has been soaked twice but no cleaning has taken place), fold some laundry, go work out *must be as buff as possible at 1:30* and get gorgeous...  I better get started!

      Reason 2456873 why I love her:  "How the hell is it that holding a stupid  piece of  wood and singing makes a man look so damn irresistable?  Talent is so  sexy,  dammit."  Sara, what in the world would I do without you?!  You complete me...tear tear...Thanks for being you which is [among many more adjectives] pretty damn incredible!

      First, drunk dialing might not be so bad.  I called the boy, his name is Sean by the way, and he returned my call on Sunday.  The first time we heard each others' voices we both were breathless/speechless.  We talked on the phone last night for 3 hours and it was simply amazing.  I never realized how great he was...I knew he was great (I'll have to journal the whole story later), but I think I was either too immature or too much of a hard ass cynic to realize how fabulous he is.  He asked me to move back to B/CS last night...I can't even remember all of the things that he was saying to me...he even said that he hoped that he was not making me uncomfortable.  I thought to myself "if not being able to breathe is uncomfortable then I like not being comfortable"  He actually swept me off of my feet with just words.  This is very frightening...  How in the hell am I going to "protect" myself when he makes me melt like butter.  Good Lord, I haven't even seen him yet.  Last time we "dated" he ran from me b/c I was an "older" woman.  He is 24 and I am 26...I HATE DATING YOUNGER MEN but I could careless if he was 5 years younger and his skin color was purple...  He is rocking the hell out of my world, and I'm lovin' it...I am also so terrified that he is going to say, "ahhh, not so much" again.  I need to not play hard to get, but I also don't need to be too honest with my emotions yet.     I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, HOW TO FEEL, WHAT TO SAY....  This song was on CMTs greatest love songs list this weekend...it is way to perfect for how I think about him...and the crazy thing is I think it would make him think about me too (he is the one that contacted me after all!)    How is it that our lives can change so quickly and seamlessly with one simple email?    ALWAYS ON MY MIND (Elvis Presley)    Maybe I didn't love you quite as good as I should have,  Maybe I didn't hold you quite as often as I could have,  Little things I should have said and done,  I just never took the time.   You were always on my mind,  You were always on my mind.   Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times,  And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine,  If I made you feel second best,  I'm sorry, I was blind.   You were always on my mind,  You were always on my mind,   Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died,  Give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied,  If I made you feel second best,  I'm sorry, I was blind.   You were always on my mind,  You were always on my mind.

      Why is it that as soon as we have a few drinks we loose all fear to call people that we KNOW that we would not allow ourselves to call when we're sober????  We even ask our friends, "do you think I should?...would you?...." etc.  Then we do it...we make the call...If we're lucky, we'll get their voicemail...We leave a message....Then we spend the next hour reliving the message we left... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH  You guessed it....I drunk dialed last night.  A month ago a wonderful man from my past contacted me (I haven't talked to him in 2 years...he emailed me).  I have been doing an excellent job of not getting too excited...I have only responded to his emails...  I gave him my phone numbers a week ago (haven't heard from him)...He send me an email on Thursday with his phone number...I responded to his email and hinted that I was looking forward to hearing from him (hint hint...he needed to call me first)...AND GUESS WHAT MY DRUNK ASS DID.....I CALLED HIM AT 1am last night.  Thank God he did not answer.  So I left a retarded message for him.  Now I get to sit and wait for him to call me.    I hate being a dumb drunk girl...but I was celebrating my birthday...so at least it was a for a great cause!

      Dammit...I wrote a very profound blog about the history of the 4th and why our country is so great and IT GOT DELETED....  Here is the cliff notes:  July 4, 1776- frightening day, the American Spirit (which is the pursuit of happiness under the flag of freedom) was born  People take it for granted.  I hate people burning the flag, but support their right to protest any other way they want...  This is a presidential election year, make sure you vote, or don't bitch about our government...  God Bless America  The other one was much more eloquent...DAMN DAMN DAMN  Happy 4th of July people!

        SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY   Happy Independence Day, a little early!  This weekend thousands upon thousands of Americans will BBQ, hang at the lake (or beach), drink ALOT of beer, eat some watermelon, and wave the flag proudly.  I am proud to be a citizen of a country that celebrates our freedom.  The French have Bastille Day, but it is no where close to our "firework" of a day on the 4th.       However, what always amazes me is the people who burn the flag on Independence day simply to protest discontent with the government.  As a scholar of the Constitution, I defend their RIGHT to do this....but, the question remains, just because you "can" doesn't mean that you "should."  Clinton's new book discusses why he "messed" with Monica...the bottom line (he says) is "because I could."  This seems to be a perfect example of why we shouldn't do something simply because we can.       July 4, 1776 was a frightening day for the First Continental Congress.  Declaring our Independence from the tyrant King George II and from the super power of England was almost inconceivable.  The American spirit was ignited on that day..."We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."  Interestingly enough, Thomas Jefferson borrowed the "life, liberty" part from John Locke...the difference was Locke's said "life, liberty and property"......The American Spirit is the pursuit of happiness.....  we have the right to pursue that HOWEVER we also have the obligation to participate in the republic.  This year is a Presidential election year, so the voter turnout will more than double...MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE PART OF THE STATISTIC OF THOSE WHO  DO  VOTE!  After voting, I encourage you to have your voice heard....protest, write letters to congressmen (and women), write editorials etc....Just DON'T burn the flag, there is nothing more disrespectful to those who have given their lives over the past 200+ years for our freedom.  OK, that's it...off of my soap box.  I feel better and I feel like a good little patriot...  God Bless America, those who dwell in her and those who defend her!

      Isn't amazing how we perceive "things"....  No matter how hard we try to be analytical, detail oriented, etc. some times we just do not see things how they really are.  I am not speaking very eloquently today...but my point is still the same.  When someone says, "I love you."  As women, we think, "what type of love, is he serious, why is he saying that (to get me in bed?), is he drunk, etc" and after we analyze all of those (plus many more) questions we think "Wow" or "Oh, no this isn't a good thing"...  The "Oh, no" response is the FLIGHT response...we should always follow our gut instinct.  The "Wow" response then produces another set of questions.  "Why?, was he serious?, how much?, commitment in the future (or now)?  etc"    As a result of my "thinker-ness" this is how I react when someone (a boy) tells me he loves me.  Is this a good thing?  or a bad thing?  I am cautious, but I am also not very trusting...  hmmmmm  I have no idea why I felt it necessary to write about this, but it has been 3 days since I have felt the "love" that a certain someone professes for me and since I am a "what have you done for me lately" type of person, I am now questioning the whole "love" thing.

      What does PITA stand for?  PAIN IN THE ASS  Somedays I absolutely HATE being an adult.  What day is today?  Bill paying day.  Trying to shuffle credit card balances as to attain the lowest APR, consolidating Student Loans, blah blah blah  It sucks.    Then I think about people with families, who have little to no education trying to make ends meet...It makes me feel empathy for them and humility for myself.    Sometimes I think like this, "I hate paying 3 students loan payments every month from my Master's Degree"  AND THEN I think about many of the students that I teach whose household income is less than mine and they have 2 adults and 3 kids to clothe, feed and maintain a roof over their heads....  I think my loan payments are not too bad.  There I feel better.  I "blogged" my way out of my "I hate being an adult" frame of mind.

      As I spent the evening worrying myself to death I got increasingly agitated, aggravated, irate, and irritable... Then I finally heard from Sean.  He could tell in my tone that I was not "normal."  I confessed to nothing, but he still told me, "Do not worry yourself over this."  After talking for 12 minutes and 36 seconds we had to get off the phone (again, not real happy since I waited ALL day to talk to him, but whatever).  So then I couldn't go back to sleep.  I did some work and then decided to look up inspirational quotes on worrying...for future reference....  It's a bunch of bull s**t   Golightly    Worrying is like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do, but it gets you nowhere."      Author: Glenn Turner       "If you want to test your memory, try to recall what you were worrying about one year ago today."      Author: E. Joseph Cossman        "There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will."      Author: Epictetus       &#8220;Worry is interest paid on trouble before it is due.&#8221;   William R. Inge    There is nothing that wastes the body like worry, and one who has any faith in God should be ashamed to worry about anything whatsoever.  Mahatma Gandhi   Worry is a cycle of inefficient thoughts whirling around a center of fear.  Corrie Ten Boom   No man ever sank under the burden of the day. It is when tomorrow's burden is added to the burden of today, that the weight is more than a man can bear.  George Macdonald   It ain't no use putting up your umbrella till it rains.  Alice Caldwell Rice   Worry never takes the sorrow out of tomorrow, it just saps today of its strengh.  Anon    Worrying does not empty tomorrow of its troubles, it empties today of its strength.  Anon    If your going to worry, there's no need to pray and if your going to pray, there's no need to worry.  Tiffany Berry    The reason worry kills more people than work does is because more people worry than work.  Anon

      Worst thing to read today:   You have 0 unread messages That added to NO phone call = SUCKING AND ME OBESESSING  So, if I was working right now, I would only have about 4-5 hours in the day to worry, fret, stress, long, etc. for him to contact me.  However, I have had 8 hours so far since I woke up to do all of the above.  I know that he will contact me at some point today...doo to doo to doo, so I wait....doo to doo doo to doo doo...still waiting...  What the hell is wrong with me?  Nothing, probably, but perhaps I am a bit of a obesessive, compulsive, worrier.  Yup, I think that is me.  In my own defense, I am only worried b/c I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY enjoyed my blissful weekend with him...and I want to do it again and again and again and again and again...  Enough of this... doo doo to doo to doo doo....still waiting for contact....

      Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity.  ~Henry Van Dyke~    "Perfect love is rare indeed - for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain."   ~Leo Buscaglia~

      To my faithful readers:  Due to a heightened security risk, the man that I have been discussing the recent blogs has had to change his identity.  He is currently in the witness protection program and will now be known by the name of Sean.  He is not pleased that he cannot read my bloggy blog life entries and has been thinking about them a great deal.  Tonight he expressed concern for his security.  "In case someone knows me and then calls me and tells me what you wrote about" My response "OK, I sorta understand you wanting to maintain anonymity..."    No prob...Sean it is...  Thank you for your respect, understanding and loyalty...

           The past 2 days have been euphoric.  Sean got here around 2 on Friday afternoon.  It was the biggest whirlwind when I first saw him... His eyes, they are the most amazing color of green and full of compassion and sweetness.  He grabbed me and held me tight enough to keep me from breathing, or was I breathless just from seeing him???  Anyways, we had a fabulous weekend.  We picked up my car and ate dinner at Chili's on Friday...then we went downtown and I drank WAY too much (so much that I made him go booty dancing with me...ha ha)...we stayed up WAY past my bedtime.  Saturday we went to breakfast/lunch (it was past 1pm) at my favorite "dive" and then we went walking/shopping at South Congress Ave.  They have very eclectic little shops with random things, antiques, etc.  We had a blast just being together.  We did not stop holding hands...the entire time.  We did nothing all day, but it was great.  I attempted to make dinner last night and found that he is a much better cook then I am (YEAH for me!)... then we stayed at home and watched a movie (thank goodness).  He is a "band guy" who stays out until 5 am all the time and I am a "home body" who loves to sit on the couch and watch TV/movies.  HOW IN THE HELL IS THIS GOING TO WORK?  He told me this weekend that I cannot think about logistics, that I just need to enjoy the emotions...then he laughed and said "ya right...I know you better than that, but just don't stress yourself over it"        Today we laid on the couch and watched Fox News, History Channel, VH1, CMT, and golf (that's right ladies and gents...we compromised and I watched Golf, it must be love).  It has been raining off and on all weekend and it was pouring at one point today.   Last week when we were talking on the phone he talked about wanting to kiss me in the rain.  So today, when it started pouring, I took off his hat and my glasses and led him outside.  He tried to whine and say that he was cold and I said that I didn't care... We stood outside in the pouring rain, kissing...and it was great.  When we came back in, he had a message from his sister that said he needed to come home (he had forgot something that he needed to do) so he had to go...SAD, SAD, SAD = me      So we go back to my room to get his things.  We laid down on the bed and he asked me "so what do we do from here?"...Like I am going to be able to answer that.  He knew better...all weekend he was probing me for how I was feeling, etc.   For some odd reason, I was not able to open up to him freely. I think it was simply b/c I am not ready.  I need/want to deal with my feelings and then share them.  I don't say "I love you" freely to just anyone...I KNOW  that I love him, but it is a little bitty baby sprout right now.  It is very fragile...and if you touch it too much it might wither... hence, why I don't want to express every thought that I am having to him.  He is the opposite, which I LOVE about him.  He tells me non-stop that I am great, perfect, amazing and that he is so in love with me.  Kinda scary, but absolutely wonderful.  Anyhow, so I try to get him to tell me what he thinks we should do and his response is "I don't think we should force the issue"................WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?  I think to myself, if we don't make an effort, how will this work out?  He is a bar manager at a restaurant and in a band...hello his schedule is CRAZY and mine is pretty busy when school is in....he won't even have weekends to spend with me...and he says DON'T FORCE THE ISSUE.....oh ya, what fuckin' issue...are you referring to the "love" that you declared for me this weekend...is that the ISSUE?  I have no idea what exactly transpired when he left.  The entire weekend was bliss, until the last 15 minutes....DAMN DAMN DAMN   (I hate being a thinker)

      This weekend I traveled back to my sweet little hometown; Midland, Texas.  I was one of the fortunate kids of my generation...I actually had a hometown.  I was raised from 1st grade through 12th grade in the same house, on the same street, in the same sweet little town.  My memories are not all wonderful...I remember when my 80s bangs wouldn't work, which resulted in throwing a huge fit in my bathroom...my big sister chasing me out of the house screaming she was going to kill me (only after I was busted listening to her phone conversations...haha)and finding refuge at my best friend's house...hitting my dad's company car when I was first driving my cute little VW Bug (we then realized I needed glasses)...my first love dumping me and my dad buying me roses to make me feel better.........The "bad" memories even seem good now.  It is really amazing how that works.    My parents moved out of my precious house 2 years ago.  It was quite possibly the hardest thing I have ever had to go through.  That sounds pretty pathetic...there are SO many people who have had to deal with hell and my "hell" was simply saying good-bye to a house.  Regardless, it was difficult for me.  Last summer I went back for a day and couldn't even drive past my house.  This was the trip for healing, or so I realized.  I went shopping at one of my favorite gift shops down town (Graham's Pharmacy, if your ever in the area)...and I saw a little plaque with this written on it:  "Parents only have to give their children 2 things:  Roots and Wings"  It hit me like a ton of bricks and like a hug from my best friend.  How true is that?!    My roots are so deep and I have been terrified to really open my wings... Why?  Fear.  Of what?  Who knows.    However, after my trip back to memory lane I was revisited by my childhood dreams.  All I have ever really wanted is to be loved, be happy and be a good person.  Guess what???? I am all 3 already.    ........Roots and Wings.......

      So, it is official, summer is over for me. I start back to work on Monday.....&nbsp; yikes. School doesn't start until Aug 16, but since I wear 10 "hats" at school my other jobs require me to go back on Monday....I'm sad.&nbsp; &nbsp; Some people would say "at least you had&nbsp;3 months off."&nbsp; I would correct them and say 7 weeks and then I would describe the typical day in the life of a teacher (or a teacher like me that is possibly certifiably insane b/c I am so dedicated)...&nbsp; It makes me laugh actaully.... my roomate the other day asked me what I was going to do for the day and I ran down my list...she responded "at least you have the time to do it...I wish I had a day off to get stuff done"&nbsp;&nbsp; AND then I think to myself...."didn't she call my from Pier 1 on her lunch break last week, that's right she has an hour lunch and usually takes 1 1/2 hours" and then&nbsp;I think, "she leaves work everyday around 5:30 at the latest and NEVER, NEVER, NEVER brings work home"&nbsp;And, her starting salary was $8,000 more a year than me (and I have my Master's)....&nbsp; Then I think back to my life, I get 30 min for lunch, which turns into 20 b/c you have to stand in the hall to monitor the kids, and maybe one day a week I get to leave at 5:30 and I have to work at home 4 days a week (at least) to grade papers and come up with great, exciting, engaging, original lessons....etc.&nbsp;     &nbsp; There, I'm done defending teachers getting time off....&nbsp; and by the way world, NO summer is 3 months anymore (but we do get 3 days at Thanksgiving, 2 weeks at Christmas, 1 week for spring break, 3 days for Easter)...I DO love my vacation time as a teacher, but also defend that I deserve it (not to say that nobody else does too) &nbsp; I love my job though.&nbsp; I get to make a difference in the world, everyday....and that means more than any vacation time OR salary....

      Good-  1st floor apartment came available today for me to move into on July 30!  I was going to be on the 3rd floor...and walking Sasha 5 times a day would be NO fun up and down the stairs.... SO EXCITEMENT IS JUMPING OFF OF ME ABOUT THE 1ST FLOOR!  Bad-  Got into minor car wreck at HEB parking lot...I was backing out, chick was stopped (I couldn't see her mind you) and I backed into her...NICE, her car is perfect, mine is not.  It is amazing what you can do going under 3 miles per hour...  bent bumper and cracked paint...gotta love it...  Ugly-  $500 deductible (formerly known as my new couch) I don't get it...I pay $110 a month for car insurance...have only been in 1 accident (prior to today)...I bump someone in my P.o.S. Ford and I have to now pay $500 to fix it?????  (for my true feelings on this look back at my P.I.T.A. entry)...  Now, to add to my pleasurable evening, I am babysitting a precious 2 year old who doesn't want to go to sleep...apparently screaming is a better option...  Babysitting = FANTASTIC birth control  Good news....I didn't save jack on my car insurance, but I did get a first floor apartment!  Yippeee

      We've heard of Drama Queens...we all know at least one...Guess What?  MEN can be very dramatic too.  Sean has officially fallen from grace (he realized that he is not ready for the reality/responsibility that comes with love) and instead of dealing with it or taking responsibility for it...he cried about it.  I sound like a brat for saying something bad about him for crying...do not misunderstand my discontent.  Tears are wonderful, they are an emotional release.  However, they can also be used to manipulate other people's feelings.  Interesting role reversal...  Men usually are the ones that get frustrated with women for using tears to get what they want...    I went to visit Sean this weekend...and it sucked.  He is "torn" ...sure he is.  He is the one that hunted me down (after 2 years) and made every effort to reconnect with me.   My theory:   he wanted me to be a challenge...to still harbor bitterness from our break up (3 years ago)...and for him to leave feeling better that "he got to see me at least one more time" and then to use those emotions to write more good "my girl doesn't want me" love songs...    What really happened:   He found me, I questioned him, I finally and let myself "go with it," we both realized that we desperately loved each other, he realized that he would have to "grow up" if he wanted to love me the way that he WANTS to love me...AND HE CAN'T HANDLE IT...  Reminds me of Jack Nicholson in  A Few Good Men  "You can't handle the truth"...  My world was rocked and now it is back to normal.  I have greatly enjoyed my new found happiness with myself and he can't change that...I won't let him.  I love the life that I have made for myself and if he can't handle it...then it is his loss.  I was myself with him, I was sweet, sassy, fun, annoying...everything.  I could have done nothing different.  I am at peace with it...  being the drama king that he is...I know it isn't over, he'll have to resurface and take another bow (so to speak).........

      When did I realize that I was being inflicted with the dreaded 3 days of bitchiness????&nbsp; Today, when I started crying (not wailing, but tears in eyes) to my fellow teacher (a man by the way) about my schedule for next year.&nbsp; Yes, I actually cried over it.&nbsp; GET A GRIP...&nbsp; It would piss me off any other given day, but today it evoked tears.&nbsp;   Why is it that we (or maybe just me) get inflicted by&nbsp; the "I must over react to absolutely everything, and everyone must understand exactly how I am feeling about XYZ, and I'll be damned if you aren't being sweet to me" attitude?&nbsp; You would think that after being a "woman" since 1991 (yikes) that I would be used to this....&nbsp; But no, I still do dumb things (ie cry over a schedule) before I realize what the hell is going on.   Last night I was upset with Sean (big surprise with current mindset) and I insisted that he talk to me until 1:20am....then I had to get up at 6 b/c I'm back in the working world this week.....&nbsp; This morning before I went to work I emailed him a novel discussing the highlights of our conversation last night (hello...he was there..)&nbsp;   WHY DO I DO SUCH FOOLISH THINGS?    Tonight I was talking with one of my closest friends (who is pregnant due in Oct) about how things are going.&nbsp; Like every pregnant woman (totally normal, no anger about this whatsoever) she talked about the baby, what she was feeling like, how much weight she had gained, the nursery...etc.&nbsp; Then she said, "don't worry, whenever you finally get pregnant you will have so many people giving you advice"&nbsp;&nbsp; GRRRRRRRR.....&nbsp; Here is a vital hint to the rest of the married world and/or baby having world&nbsp; JUST B/C MY LIFE IS NOT LIKE YOURS DOES NOT MEAN THAT I WILL NEED YOUR HELP WHEN EVER I "GET THERE"....BY THE WAY,    MY LIFE IS VALID, AND NORMAL ...AND I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A HUSBAND OR A CHILD TO FEEL "NORMAL"......ggggggggrrrrrrrrrrrr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, remember that I am suffering from the bitch of the month syndrome.....however, that sentiment is always true.&nbsp; I love all of my friends, no matter what stage of life they are in.&nbsp; I am very sick of them "patting me on the head"&nbsp; and saying things like, "don't worry, you'll have this some day too."&nbsp; I hate that more that I could ever possibly convey in any given amount of words.&nbsp; Ok, there I am done and I feel slightly better.   The only plus to PMS is that my breasts grow...very nice for a little 34B person like myself.&nbsp;  NOTE: &nbsp; I am trying to learn to focus on the positive and dammit, if my cleavage is it then that is all I have to work with....   &nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of every school year I have this overwhelming sense of responsibility come over me...&nbsp; Not the "I have to do my 'job' well" type of responsibility but more I have to use my powers for good/not evil type of responsibility.&nbsp; That sounds funny...but it is SO true.&nbsp; Everyone has a story about the teacher from hell that made them hate math (or even worse history) or that scared them life b/c of a comment they said....etc.&nbsp; similarly, everyone has a memory of a great teacher...that inspired them, or that made learning fun, or that simply really cared about them....&nbsp; Every year at this time I experience the anxiety that goes along with trying to be the second type of teacher for every student that I teach.&nbsp; I am no longer the naive, completely idealistic "new" teacher that actually thinks that every single child will love my class/and or me for that matter (last year I actually had a kid tell me off on the last day of school...he used the words "I can't stand you, I have hated you all year and thank God this is over"...the sad thing is that I actually liked this kid...until that moment, of course...now he will forever be remembered as a giant pain in the ass)&nbsp; Anyways...&nbsp; regardless of the few kids that I teach (like the above mentioned) that are not a pleasure...most of them are.&nbsp; Today I watched my girls "un-knot" themselves in a human web.&nbsp; They were so inspiring.&nbsp; I did not give them any instructions other than "don't let go of the persons' hand that you are holding."&nbsp; I sat back and watched them lead each other, communicate effectively, and encourage each other...it was so incredible.&nbsp; Kids never cease to amaze me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no real point to this blog  other than to remind myself  (and whoever reads this) that kids are unique, amazing, inspiring, joyful, wonderful creatures.&nbsp; They are more insightful then they get credit for and more valuable then we realize.&nbsp; I read a quote today that made me go "hmmmm....wow...."&nbsp; it was:&nbsp; "A child's education should begin a 100 years before they are born"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in a previous mentioned blog, many of my friends are married and having children of their own...&nbsp; I am actually really glad that I am not "there" right now.&nbsp; I know that when I have my own family that I will not be able to devote the same level of attention, love, and time into my kids at school...&nbsp; So right now, I feel blessed with the awesome responsibility to teach another set of kids (approx. 120 this year).&nbsp; I have taught approx. 400 kids in my career, so far....&nbsp; wow.&nbsp;

          Thank God for my Mom!!!!     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is going to be a quickie...I have no time for fun....&nbsp; I am moving on Friday (Yippee!!) and I am super stressed about it.&nbsp; I had the Garage Sale from hell on Saturday ...&nbsp; I am teaching my dance camp this week (note:&nbsp; 1.34 of 4 dances are choreographed as of yet)... and I am sifting through the craziness that I have called home for 2 years.&nbsp; I am not a slob, but I'm not exactly "on top of things" either.&nbsp; I think that messiness is a clear sign of genius (look out Albert, here I come)...&nbsp; My roommate is very similar in the messiness/not real organized category...what does this equal A PAIN IN THE ASS TO CLEAN OUT/MOVE.&nbsp; My wonderful sister and my parents rescued me this weekend.&nbsp; My mom (aka June Cleaver) is the most amazing woman on earth.&nbsp; My dad and I took some stuff up to my school (we were gone about an hour) and we return to my entire guest room packed, all the pictures on my walls packed, the house vaccumed and 2 loads of laundry done...WOW, what a woman...
