          SEANS MOTIVATIONAL CORNER      "It is I" said the Sean.. Back in your face for our first writing of Seans Motivational Corner.. Today's motivation is going to be about positivity.. I know every tree hugging hippy and their mother is telling you "smile" or love one another. But it is true.. Going to the extreme may be just a little too much but you can still do your best to refrain from the negative. Take this example… Just today while driving to the library some guy in a corvette in front of me slammed on his breaks.. I almost hit him (the sun was glaring on his break lights so I didn't see them go off).. He got upset and flipped me the bird. I promptly waved at him and smiled… I could just see the look of embarrassment on his face as he was trying to figure out why the heck I was smiling (was he thinking that I knew him, that I had something planned for the corvette, etc)… That truly did make my day.. I'm sure it made his also. So back to the basics…always remember "You can do it".. That will carry you a long way…                      SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BAND      Hey guys.. I have many friends with local bands and we must do our part to support them. Me and my crew are going to see Rock Star Club next   Friday August 6th at the Double Door  .. Be there or be queer… Click link below for more details.   urlLink http://www.rockstarclub.com/                 THE LOST PHENONEM OF THE REPRESSED DISC JOCKEY'S      A very strange thing happened after work on Saturday. Our office (for DJ's) has about a staff of 20+ dj's that goes out every Saturday evening to ROCK the suburbs. When we returned from our jobs last Saturday all of our frustration's came to a hilt.. We ripped our shirts off, broke a bunch of glowsticks and donned hats to become the village people and dance the YMCA. That is true.. You are reading that right.. The YMCA is a song we have played 2-3 times a week, every week for the past 6 years (in some cases 10+ years) of our lives.. Yet we were compelled to dress up and BE the village people.. Much like drag queens like to impersonate women, we impersonated the VILLAGE PEOPLE… ahhh… and it felt oooo sooooo good.. I was meant to be a Village Person. And I am OK with that… WHAT A GREAT TIME TO BE ALIVE !!!              <> POLITICS           I promise that I will keep the political chatter to a MINIMUM.. We all have vastly different political views and I respect that... What I don't respect is people that DONT VOTE.. It is soooo damn easy now with the internet.. All you have to do is goto  urlLink www.rockthevote.com , and it will have ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS for you. Do this and have a say in how they run your future..                  Stay Tuned for the next episode……      fin

          TODAY'S FEATURE                As most of you know I am a disc jockey. (hence the name dj excitement)… I work through a larger company known at "Show On The Road Productions" (www.showontheroad.com).. We are ranked one of the ten best dj companies in the nation on a consistent basis, and we are the   Chicago   area's #1 dj company.. One of the things we are known for doing is our innovative request taking. When we are djing a wedding during dinner we will go to every guest in the wedding at their tables to take their requests… I have done over 300+ shows which equals over 5000 requests that I have taken in my tenure as a DJ.. I've decided to go through my memory bank's and list the most offbeat song requests I have received…. Keep in mind, this is for a wedding.. YMCA and the Electric Slide are the type of music that get people up and dance.. Stuff like Metallica and Korn is just going to rip the elderly people (usually 1/4 of the attendee's) at weddings into a frenzy.. Weddings are a funny thing.. The cheesier the better, the cooler the more BORED everybody seems to get.. A great example is everybody continues to make Vanilla Ice jokes.. But as soon as I throw down "Ice Ice Baby" everybody and their grandma is "Rollin' in their 5.0's With their ragtop's down so their hair can blow"… TO THE LIST!              TOP TEN INANE SONG REQUEST'S AT WEDDINGS               10. Can you turn it down I can't hear myself talk :  I know, this isn't a song request. But I had to put this in here. People literally spend thousands of dollars on these weddings and hire a DJ to put on a 2-3 hour show at the end of it. All elderly people seem to do is find our speakers. Sit next to them, and try to hold conversations while I'm trying to get people to dance. Why can't the old people go in the lobby? Why didn't they talk during dinner when it was quiet.. They are 80 years old? Haven't they talked to these people around them enough in 80 years? Just what have they been doing? aRrrghhh.. I'm rambling..                 9. Quoting the first couple lyrics rather then the song title :  To stupid people "You Shook Me All Night Long" = "She was a mean machine", or "Can't Help Falling In Love With You" = "Wiseman say why do…" or "American Pie" = "A long long time ago", I regress… Err I mean, civilization has regressed              8. Ewan Macgregor/Jennifer Lopez/Keanu Reeves/Jennifer Love Hewitt/Kirsten Dunst/Bruce Willis/Russel Crowe :  I thought these people were actors?? Who would have thought Ed Murphy's "Party all the Time" would have inspired everyone to release solo albums.                 7. Bon Jovi :  This is usually a normal request… FOR WHITE PEOPLE… If you are not white you have no business liking Bon Jovi… On that matter… I do not consider myself white so I too will not be requesting Bon Jovi anytime soon..                 6. Slayer :  This is either a joke request from some mongoloid in a hockey jersey or some grease ball kid wearing a "good charlotte" shirt.. I always throw back at them "I left Seasons Into The Abyss at home" and usually they are shocked by my slayer aptitude and leave me alone (while other kids were studying in high school, I was getting high with stoners and banging my head against the shed in the backyard).                5. IN A GADDA DA VIDA - Iron Butterfly  - This is the "jokester" older peoples(middle age baby boomers)version of the Slayer request.. (see # 6)              4. The Golden Girls Theme Song :  This wouldn't be such a bad request… for an 80 year old… What hurt is that a 24 year old bride requested this.. She must have been 7 years old when the Golden Girls were on.. Why wasn't she watching "Small Wonder" like the rest of us 7 year olds?????              3.     Tower    of    Power     :  With songs like "You Got To Funkifize" and "   Walkin' Up Hip Street  " it's amazing they haven't broken any sales records.. Apparently these guys were a 70's band that used to live next to the Grateful Dead.. THAT IS THEIR FRICKIN' claim to fame? They lived next to the Grateful Dead??? These guys are the Cosmo Kramer's of the 70's hippy rock era… You can check out their official website at http://www.bumpcity.com/                2. Spacehog :  imusic says "Spacehog has that spark of genius and greatness"…. Yeah unfortunately for Spacehog that spark started a fire and burned all their fingers off so they can't play their instruments properly. Radiohead, Coldplay, maybe even Yanni I can understand?? But Spacehog.. at a wedding? It's kind of a cool name tho.. Almost kinda like Sonic the Hedgehog.. I should start playing that theme.. I could start my own dance.. Kinda like the chicken dance?? I can call it the "Hedgehog" dance. I will have everyone turn around and bendover and kick at the floor…                 1. Flight of the Bumblebee  - Rimsky-Korsakov - It's a cool classical song.. The fact that someone requested this to play a wedding during dancing is just utterly hilarious.. THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BE ALIVE!!             fin

         Alas, HARK, who hath tho' go there? I am back after my short absence.. Due to growing readership (of which I am very grateful!) I have decided to re invigorate the BLOG.. To tell you the truth I had expected my writings to fall upon def ears.. But my loyal friends (and readers ) have once again demonstrated themselves as the coolest people on this earth by asking for more. From this point forward I SHALL update this at least weekly. I will be your entertainment for the rest of my (and your lifetime).. Guaranteed, signed and cross my heart, swear against my children's graves (of yet there are none.. but soon?)… Before we get into the meat of my features I am going to rant…       <>      SEANS RANT-   The world is a big and wonderful place.. We are on this earth but a moment.. ENJOY IT.. SAVOR IT… ABSORB IT… and for chrissakes, STOP WATCHING 3+ hours of TV a day.. We all do it.. There are a billion stars in the skies to glare at, a million books to read at your local library, miles and miles of paths to jog.. Yet we watch the same 5 channels OVER and OVER hours on end… Your average American can name more guest appearances in episodes of friends then they can name politicians.. That my friend is SCARY… The TV can wait… call your family, call a friend, walk your dog.. ANYthing, just get out the damn house and away from the TV……….            And a side note to this.. Movies and TV are DIFFERENT… Movies are artistic mediums that must have ENTERTAINMENT value to survive. TV is produced wholly by TV executives bent on keeping you around for commercials.. Now I know you are saying but "Sean isn't watching a movie and tv the same?".. No they are not the same.. Movies are short (like 1.5 - 3 hours long) and better movies are usually brainchild's of the directors.. (I personally think it is ok to watch 3-4 movies a week) Good directors will not allow their producers to interfere with their visions. Most tv programs (there are exceptions to this rule) are run by literally ten - twenty people, all with different ideas in mind. They are long (some series run 30+ episodes per year), boring, not funny and often overdramatic for no reason. That is all, I am done ranting. Please email me and I will be happy to discuss this with you… NOW ON TO THE FEATURES………
