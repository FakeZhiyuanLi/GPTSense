      &nbsp;argh...my parents are fucking morons, in case any of you were wondering. i got my bank statemennt in the mail yesterday and they are bitching because i have no money left. well lets see, when your 16, and your parents make you pay for absolutly EVERYTHING because your mother spends all the money they have, yet your job isnt giving you any hours so your getting shit paychecks...yea thats pretty much what happen s, YOU RUN OUT OF MONEY. so then they inform me that when i run out, my check card doesnt get declined like i THOUGHT. oh no, it just simply takes the money from my svings account. after it does that 6 tims , it CHARGES you 25 dollars everytime it does it. so ok ....i dont think i did it THAT many times, well THEN my dad tells me that he FORGOT to deposit the 140$ i asked him to deposit into my chcking, and never told me, so on tues i went out with kathleen and bought stuff because i thought i had money. yea, turns outi didnt...so if they charge me, its still my problem because my mom says it isnt my dads fault that he forgot...umm lemme think for a min, YES IT IS HIS FUCKING FAULT!!! and then i went to wawa to check my savings balance to make sure they hadnt charged me anything, and i was missing 300$ so needless to say i was freakin out, when i cme home i got SCREAMED at, oh and then my dad says, by the way i took 300 out of ur savings for your car...so im like... really pissed...fuck them both &nbsp; &nbsp; wow that was a long rant, glad i got that out

      Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe Sometimes I need you to stay away from me Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need you to go  Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities What you were changing me into Just give me myself back and Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities Take all your faithlessness with you Just give me myself back and Don’t stay  Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need to be alone  I don’t need you anymore I don’t want to be ignored I don’t need one more day  of you wasting me away

      Let's talk this over It's not like we're dead Was it something I did? Was it something You said? Don't leave me hanging In a city so dead Held up so high  On such a breakable thread  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  [Chorus:]  You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending   You've got your dumb friends I know what they say They tell you I'm difficult But so are they But they don't know me Do they even know you? All the things you hide from me All the shit that you do  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  [Chorus]  It's nice to know you were there Thanks for acting like you cared And making me feel like I was the only one It's nice to know we had it all Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done

      i just got home from work and im so bored...so i thought id write a bit although it might help if i had something to write ABOUT im about to say fuck it and not write anything im having a birthday party! most likely on the 6th of aug...which is my bday so anyone who is reading this, ur most likely invited, seeing as im inviting everyone i know this post is kinda pointless no?   anyways...the reason im having a big party is because last yr my mom tried to give me a sweet 16 party, but 4 people came...cuz i had no friends...so most of the people were her friends, but this year i have alot more friends, so im inviting them all =D  yea thats right, i had nooooo friends last yr, i dont know why...maybe because i was being all goth and pretending like i hated everyone, although...i dont like many people, i love everyone, but i dont like most people, im just friends with them, and i cant really be with many people for longer than a few hours before they get on my nerves...ESPECIALLY girls wow ive said to much about that, i love you guys though!

      maybe i should actually write something in this, seeing as i took the time to make one... i have no idea what to write though, my life is rather boring and i cant think of anyone who would really wanna read about it i saw spiderman 2 last night..kick ass movie...ya... i have work tonight...stupid work...did i mention that i hate my job? well, i do so yeeeea...  You know what sucks a wHOOOLE lot? when you think u can trust someone, and u think that someone cares as much about you as you care about them, and then u realize that the whole time, they never gave a fuck...can be quite annoying if u ask me...i thought i could prove that my theory that no person can EVER be trusted was wrong, but no, its right, no one can be trusted

      so its been quite some time since ive updated this, alot has happend lately! for one, my alarm just went off and i dont feel like getting up to turn it off....god damn anyway, i got grounded starting today, which totally sucks beyond anything, and is really fucking stupid warped tour was on wed, and it was incredible, i met matchbook romance, sugarcult, flogging molly, and motion city soundtrack!!! MCS is my second favorite band so of corse i was freaking out, and i absolutly love flogging molly!!! i also got to take pictures with the bands, which was very cool, and i have alot of bruises from the pit which i am extremly proud of and have been showing everyone! friday was my birthday, a few people blew me off, and ALOT of people complelty forgot that it was my birthday, but other than that i had a good day. i had cake for breakfast, and i got to wear my crown all day! the day actually got good when kathleen came over. shes such an awsome friend. we went to starbucks and she told everyone that it was my bday, and of corse i turned bright red and they sang to me, but then they gave me a coupon for a free drink! and apparently one of the girls working there went to warped and ALSO met flogging molly. so we talked about that for a bit and then we went out to my car. on the way kathleen told every person that walked by that it was my bday then we sat in my car for like an hour talking, and i mentioned to her the problem i have been faced with lately...and then we taled about some other random shit then we went bowling with matt and will and corey. that was so much fun, a couple people i know, gary and shane, showed up and played with us, well no, they didnt pay, thay just took my turns while people held me back lol, but we played until like 1am and it was so much fun then kathleen came over and we stayed up all night talking about my problem...let me tell you, i am quite i mess lately....god damn leah and addie for suggesting what they did...lol so yea...i best go take a shower, i have work today...
