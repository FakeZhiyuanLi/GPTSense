      I was leafing through a copy of  Oxfam News  floating around my opticians yesterday. Not the sort of thing I usually read, but the cover article – “How do we measure our impact on poverty?” – seemed interesting enough to warrant picking up over  Woman’s Own . The image of flour being poured into a scale pan (although the back page insisted it was rice), hardly the most glamorous method of illustrating your work, seemed to promise a balanced analysis of what Oxfam did, and how well it did it.  As you might expect the magazine detailed what was going on in crisis areas: Israel and Darfur, but also the areas that don’t make the news such as the poor Russians in the almost entirely rural region of Tajikistan who were given lessons on how to grow food properly, after years of hunger. There are also small reports on fundraising events, mostly in England. In fact I never got round to absorbing the cover article: because what struck me as I began to read critically is how negative the articles often were. “Hilary Benn, Secretary of State for International Development, responded [to the lobbyists] by announcing £12 million to help get children into school,” states one article concerning young children from England talking to their MPs about the lack of 3rd world education. £12 million is a noteworthy amount to spend on something that, for all the morality behind it, only indirectly affects the spender for whom countless other causes are crying out for funds. But “it’s not enough” intones the article immediately afterwards. No ‘thank you’, no gratitude, just a good old-fashioned whine. I’m not disputing whether it is enough or not, I would be surprised if it weren’t, but the rude nature of the article instantly put my back up. Twelve million and not a word of thanks in this official publication.  There were others: regarding donating to Oxfam in your Will, “extending your generous support to your chosen good cause” – it’s a Will, don’t make it sound like you’re paying protection money to a 1920’s gangster. And on campaigning against the workhouses that produce sports gear: “The IOC failed to recognise its responsibilities”. It’s this sort of negative spin that reduces the credibility of a organisation. While all the statements I’ve quoted are entirely true, they are presented in a manner designed to reflect badly on those the author believes are in the wrong, or suck up to people who might be donating money when they die. Within the pages of its magazine Oxfam changes from a humanitarian organisation to a humanitarian organisation filled with open hate towards anyone who is in their way and which wants your money so badly it has trouble keeping a lid on its desires. Perhaps towards Nestle, who tried to charge Ethiopia $6m in debts through a loophole in international law, the offensive nature is justified. But giving everybody grief at every opportunity is slipping into the realms of viciousness.

      I'm not completely happy with this: I'll probably rewrite it at some point. The article's point is quite simple: that the human mind will always better graphics technology.  As we vault up the technological mountain of computer realism (and shimmy up the greased pole of gameplay) our experiences in virtual worlds become more vivid, more believable and increasingly more detailed. We can now look out over rolling plains, admire grandiose cities and walk, fly or drive over huge areas. It wasn’t always that way, of course. The earliest games were simple blocks of colour or text before they moved on to the odd sprite or other 2D display before, with a few dead-ends, entering the world of 3D polygons. Since then things have only improved, but there’s one tiny detail the industry has forgotten about: that the human imagination is far superior to any video card.  Take, for example,  Age of Empires II .  AOE2  was a 2D game, based on sprites taken from high-poly models walking round maps with the illusion of height. There were many single-player campaigns made for the game, and if someone walked in and watched you playing one it was a few men walking around a field. But to you, the player, it was something more. There was summer rain in this field, and the mud was slowing your men down. Behind you lay a range of mountains, to the right a coppice of trees and ahead the farmstead where you may or may not find the food you needed to continue and not die of hunger. The unrealistic graphics and fixed perspective forced you to use your mind to place yourself in the shoes of your character – something that the standard random map games never achieved. That game could look like crap but be absolutely beautiful. Fast forwards three years and  Age of Mythology  hits the shelves. It has a dully-realised 3D engine where you can implement weather, have smooth hillsides and zoom down to your character to give him a face, a personality. Instead of moving your unit down a market street having to imagine what the situation looks like from the ground, you can  be at ground level yourself . Sounds good? It wasn’t. It was all true in theory of course, but when it came to actually implementing any of these ideas there was nothing left for the imagination to do: you were substituting a human mind for a piece of silicon with no emotion, no idea of what appeals to the player, and nowhere near the ability to populate a world with detail. There is no fog in your imagination, no blurry textures or clipping. But surely having a more realistic world can only aid the imagination? That isn’t so when the world is as sparse as a 3D one must be. Detail levels rarely go up – perhaps they do in terms of image quality but rarely in environment design. A three-dimensional area can only hold a fraction of the detail that that same two-dimensional area could, and once you have seen that 2D area you cannot fail to notice the shortcomings of the 3D one. Whereas  AOE2  maps were teeming with wildlife and forests and had an artist’s palette of pleasant terrain mixtures, all of that was out of the question for the new 3D world where memory usage and poly counts soon went sky-high. Give players a world like their own and it had better be as detailed as their own.  This is the reason why, despite trying their hardest, Bioware will never top pen and paper D&D with their games, why  Doom 3  is just so damn scary until you install a flashlight mod, why  Civilization 2  is the most breathtaking game I have ever played. It’s the human mind: and it is the best graphics card out there.

      I wrote this piece several months ago, so it's a little shakey in places (I still can't get the introduction right), but stick with it. This is where I started - let's see where I can go.   The year is 1201. Headstrong King John I of England has come to power and has immediately ordered an attack on French soil. Taking personal command of the mounted sergeants, longbowmen and hobilars along with his own personal entourage of knights present in Brittany, the King of England lead his army deep into French territory. The French reaction was predictable: soldiers from across the nearby provinces marched to defend their homeland. The two opposing forces met near the town of Orbec, on the very edge of hilly central region of Normandy. These are the events of that day.  As the rain cleared from the hill, the king wished the never-ending sheets would return. One of the young arrow boys returned from the coppice and described what he saw. The boy was drenched with mud, and ran like a leper. But after an age he breathlessly reached King John. Seventy archers, milord, fifty men without no horses and sixty with. He stammered, bowing down to the filthy earth in front of the Kings polished but mud-splattered metal boot. The king thanked the boy and smiled, but pushed him away none too roughly: if the whelp hadnt miscounted, they were outnumbered nearly two to one. They had a height advantage, and a range advantage with their deadly longbows, but, dammit, no hand-to hand foot troops. Either the cavalry would be wasted defending the archery or they would risk a bloodbath and the loss of fifty-five of Englands finest. But then against the odds they were facing now, it would take risks like that to pull off a victory. Heaving himself onto his stallion the monarch rode forwards, faithfully followed by two of his knights. His forces were loosely deployed on a small, elongated hill covered by further hills to all directions except East  from which the French were advancing. The small coppice the boy had run from covered the middle third of the Northern slope of the English hill  possibly a good place to lead a surprise charge through, although with just cavalry the effect would be weakened. It also blocked both sides from seeing past it, although with the slope that was more of an advantage to the French than English. No, the main battle line would have to be forward of that scanty cover. Riding forward, the enemy came into the Kings view. Archers at the front, cavalry behind, and foot troops at the rear  probably including their general. Sitting on a shallow North-Westerly slope facing the English, they werent moving. Ahead of them and a little to their right lay a small collection of peasant huts on the path of the track going through the area, passing along the Southern side of the English hill, snaking around the French lines and joining another track to head East. It was the road they had been following, and the arrival of the French from that direction was a good indicator that it was the right one. To the North of the French, nearly but not quite in line with them, lay a small hill covered almost entirely with trees, not too far from the enemy lines. French soldiers could be hidden in that forest, and flushing them out would be difficult. Directly ahead of the English lay the slope down, with a small flat area covered by shrubs and bushes  a perfect place to position the longbowmen but alas, hopelessly out of range. The remainder of the land between the opposing armies was flat and largely featureless. There was a strategy just waiting, screaming to be uncovered in this terrain. The only question was whether he had seen it or not.  If the French werent going to make a move, the King decided, he was damned if he wasnt going to either. Futile as it was, Lord Audleys longbowmen were ordered to the small plateau in the hillside, then when the hobilars were in position to advance on to the huts which should provide cover from French arrows; and more importantly any cavalry charges. Now it was time to take a calculated risk. The light horse, under the command of another lord he had long forgotten the name of, were sent down the Southern slope and deployed on the track heading through the hamlet to French lines. The king, his bodyguard and the mounted sergeants took the Northern road to the other side of the small, wooded hill. The French did not move. It was not until he got closer to the enemy lines that the King discovered one fact the boy did not pick up  there were not seventy archers, but fifty archers and forty crossbowmen. He spat from his open visor. Could those bastard ditch-born children of whores not even fight with real weapons? Not to worry he grinned inwardly: so long as his heavily armoured knights stayed away from them they lose any and every advantage over conventional bow and arrows. Looking to his right, the longbows were moving now, marching quickly down the centre of the field towards the huts, when finally the French made a move. Their archers and crossbowmen, supported by the foot soldiers  nothing more than militia by the looks of it began moving methodically towards the loose collection of huts, with the clear intention of letting the longbowmen get there first. The hobilars were now in a position to charge, but to do so would be suicide for such a lightly armed and armoured group. They held their ground to the South, while the rest of the horses continued round the North flank of the French. The kings group became entirely hidden by the forested hillock just as the arrows began to fly. The others would be on their own now, out of sight but most certainly not out of mind. He could hear distant cheering, and prayed that the longbowmen were not being charged, and that the other horse riders were not counter-attacking, and the noises continued as they rounded the wood after what seemed like an eternity but was in reality a matter or seconds. Immediately ahead of the riders were the French horse  light horses similar to the English hobilars still waiting on the other flank to chase any routing enemy, and mounted sergeants equally similar to those riding alongside the kings royal guards. Arrows and crossbow bolts were still flying into the and from the huts  a stalemate that would soon be broken. With a few deft hand motions, the king signaled to the leader of the sergeants to execute a pincer movement against the mounted French. And with cries of Saint George! they charged.  The attack was unexpected, the enemy unready. But almost instantly the king realised his mistake: he was on the left, and should the other group of cavalry regroup and charge  which they were bound to do  his valuable knights would be exposing their vulnerable flank. But it was too late. The horses were charging, the men shouting and the best the king could do was manoeuvre into the front centre of the group. As the first horses hit home the men new the fight had really begun. Two fell before the King, one slashed down the back with a broken spine, the other grasping what was left of his face with agony. But in such a short time he had entirely forgotten about the light French horse who had not been engaged, and now they were galloping at full speed towards his personal guard. FLANK LEFT! FLANK LEFT! He cried  but it was too late. Sir Hugh le Pycard fell, as did Roger le Wis, Sir Thomas Mayle and Sir Richard Oswald and one other from these peasants on horseback. There was no honour dying to a serf! No ransom to be paid to a group of rats who did not know the meaning of the word. They had taken five knights in one fell blow  they were not going to take a single man more. Pushing through his knights, he found a young French rider with wide eyes trying to run. He died. The other knights, following his lead, left the already decimated French sergeants and began hacking at the unprotected scouts. However the French had the protection of the slope, and the fighting presented a challenge to the already tiring English horses and men. Over half of the French horse were slaughtered before anyone realised why they were not breaking: the militia, with the enemy general, were charging them from the rear. Sprinting over the terrain they could be heard with ease, even over the din of battle. But the archers and crossbows had not moved. The King didnt need to look to know that the hobilars had chosen that moment to strike. His notion was confirmed moments after din from the ineffectual militia impact against his mounted sergeants died down to the horns of archer groups as they turned and ran. There were only a handful of French light horse left  he snarled French curses and they too routed whether they heard him or not. The other riders tried to run too but they were surrounded and in a matter of seconds cut down to the last man. Then the generals unit, the only fighting force left in Normandy, broke and the battle turned into a bloody, one-sided slaughter. After them! the King shouted, I want that general taken alive!. What better way to end this victory than with the humiliation of capturing a general alive? The battle had been won in under a minute from the moment the cavalry charged into the unaware French reserve, and now all that was left was a strung out line of archers, running fruitlessly from the spears of the hobilars, and the generals unit, doing much the same from his swords. However the victory had cost him many dear friends. Eleven of the finest knights in England had died because he chose the wrong side of his medium cavalry to charge from, sergeants of whom nearly twenty had died. Four longbowmen had been pierced by crossbow bolts, though none from arrows, but there had fortunately been no hobilar casualties. Tonight they would rest and tend to their wounds. But tomorrow they would have to press on towards Flanders. For there, five hundred Frenchmen were waiting: the King would need to arrive at the same time as the reinforcements from Wessex crossed the channel four days from now. Otherwise, this victory would have been hard-won indeed.

      When I made this blog, I didn't want to use it as just another outlet for my personal life: I made it to give me an incentive to write, as it's something I don't do often enough. I'm trying to enter a career of journalism, a world of not much money and a lot of hard work, but it's what I want to do and I strongly believe that is more important than anything else. So there won't be any laments about my love life (I could only ever write one blog on it, anyway) or whines about parking spaces. This will be opinion, news, what I'm working on and why. Straight to it then.  I want to be a journalist because I like writing, and if I do say so myself am pretty good at it. I've a long way to go, as I'm sure anyone experienced will tell me immediately but I still consider myself above average on the writing stakes. Given that you are reading this, chances are you will be too. So I guess I could try to get work experience? Unfortunately the publishing group I worked with for a few days, Firecrest Books, went into receivership a few weeks back after a pair of artists who had already ruined two companies set against it. A complete waste of incredible talent, sending the manager out on the street without a home to go to. Another problem is that I don't have English Language A-Level, purely due to my school not offering it. I could have done English Literature but I hate that, and as I said before I'm all about making sure I'm doing what I want. I took essay subjects like History to make up for it, but it's not enough to get me a job. I'm going to have to prove myself without a mark on some paper kept on a shelf. It's the University of Life for me, at least so far as entering journalism is concerned. Birmingham Uni is looking very good (incidentally, I found out that my online nickname is slang for University in the UK, and disturbingly cheerleading groups in the US) but I won't be doing anything directly related to the English language there. So my only option is freelance.  And now, the introduction to my first attempt at real journalism.  "Any player of  Half-Life  based games must, by now, have heard of Steam. The old World Opponent Network or ‘WON’ servers were shut down last month and the only way to play games such as  Counter-Strike  and  Day of Defeat  is now through Valve Software’s program. Pay a visit to the website (www.steampowered.com) and you can read the list of features, but they only give a brief insight. Even when you install it and create an account, there is still little clue as to what is really going on behind those beguiling green frames. You would be justified in wondering exactly what it was that you were downloading to your computer. You might even be justified in some suspicion in a world filled with spyware: but more likely you would just want to understand how things work. Don’t worry, it’s only natural."  It’s a simple 1500 word article on Steam, and I’m looking around for a publisher. PC Gamer UK were encouraging their readers to send in articles for a cash incentive (seems like a good hybrid of deep end and a sensible start) but that seems to have been dropped, so my next target is online game news sites. Failing that I’ll just post it here and at forums and spread links around. These bastards will notice whether they like it or not.
