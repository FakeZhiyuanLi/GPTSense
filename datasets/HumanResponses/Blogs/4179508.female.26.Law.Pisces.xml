      Here are some passages of script that I say over to myself in these times that try the soul (okay! sorry - no  Anne of Green Gables  quotes ... although they do have their uses -  evil laughter)      Philosophers have argued for centuries about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but materialists have known all along   that it depends on whether they are jitterbugging or dancing cheek to cheek.   Tom Robbins from  Jitterbug Perfume     This one is a doozy - go Margaret Mahy   Whatever she named she saw, what she saw she struggled to name, not one ocean, but all oceans, deserts of ice, coloured only with sunrise, sunset and the shifting lights of the aurora, sand sifting to the very boundary of sight.  Somewhere in the flesh of the earth, the dreadful earthquake shuddered, the tide walked to and fro on the leash of the moon, rainbows formed, winds swept the sky like giant brooms piling up clouds before them, clouds which writhed into different shapes, melted into rain or darkened, bruised themselves against an unseen antagonist and went on their way, laced with forking rivers of lightning, complete with white electric tributaries ...

      It’s storming outside.  I’m sitting here listening to Simon and Garfunkel – thinking how much just one cigarette would make the storm outside that much more evocative.  There’s absolutely nothing like sitting in the warmth, looking out of your rain spattered window, watching your smoke curl into the air, while the wind blows everything to buggery outside. Alas – not to be.  I needs must find comfort in my black decaf and my valium.  Is it really worth giving up something that you enjoy so much?  Sure, I may be able to breathe properly again – but what’s proper respiration to comfort?  I’m sure there must be some out there, but can a person ever really like exercise?  I mean, it can feel good when you finally break through that barrier – and the sweat’s streaming off you and the bass is pumping and your lungs are doing what they’re supposed to – eg working … but it really doesn’t make getting up the next morning and going back to do the same thing any easier, or more enjoyable. I’m sensing a negative theme here tonight.  Readers, if any, beware. Watched Irreversible tonight with the sibs.  Verdict: an indulgent piece of crap.  It’s a wonder ol’ Johnny went to the trouble of banning it at all.  The rape scene was pretty awful – or pretty well done, depending on one’s perspective – but the context in which it was couched made it seem more like an exercise in gratuitousness without any real function in the storyline.  If John Howard had taken the broomstick out of his arse for any minute fraction of time, he probably would have realised that he didn’t need to ban it – there was no need – all he had to do was let the word get around how pointless the whole thing was and the public would have made the decision for themselves. Of course, the public isn’t capable of doing this.  We can only be grateful that John is there looking out for us … Moving on.  I remember the same fuss that was made over that French film Romance – about three years back.  That film was also (well, in my august opinion anyway) complete crap … but just make mention of the phrase ‘gratuitous sex scenes’ and of course we’re all flocking to the cinemas (or probably more appropriately video stores) to see it/rent it out.  I know I did.  I should have used the money to buy myself a loufa – rubbing dead skin off my feet would have been a far better use of my time. La Reine Margot – now that’s a film, or Betty Blue – what is the French preoccupation with madness anyway? – madness, blood, death and sex – with a few bodily fluids thrown into the mix.  All hail visceral cinema – as long as it remains cinematic at the same time.  Pure viscera – in whatever form – just doesn’t cut it. Have to work tomorrow – well, today, actually.  One of the lower circles of hell – you can practically smell the sulphur as you cross the threshold – craftily, but not completely, hidden beneath the scent of frying Kanmantoo bacon and pancake batter. The joy of it all; dealing with individuals who have the collective mentality of six year olds with ADHD; unfortunately, in this case, there is absolutely no medication to help them.  It’s like University Lecturer Syndrome – there is absolutely no cure.  We could, of course, tie their hands and feet together and dunk them in a large body of water … but the odds are that they’d float – so what would be the point in that? It’s Nick Drake now.  He always reminds me of Sweden – particularly Hornstull, and getting shitfaced with Teresa and Thomas in her apartment … Sigh – I suppose I’d better try and sleep.  Visit briefly with Anita Blake and her annoying witticisms – then hope to god that Morpheus takes pity on me.  (I suspect the valium might act as a lure) Goodnight. ps - pasted from saturday night from no net access computer (sigh)

      Do you ever wish that you could go back through your life?  Go back to childhood, at a particular age, and begin again - only doing so knowing everything that you know now?  When I think about it seriously (and I know that the mere fact that I would give this serious thought is a bit worrying) - but when I do, I'm not sure that I would; what with having to worry about that existential dilemma of how much should you change - indeed, should you change anything at all ...  But the idea of it, purely musingly, could be rather cool.  I think the thing that appeals to me the most is the opportunity to shine - just think, a 10 year old who could recite Hamlet's soliloquy, and could grasp Lacanian philosophy (well, sort of).  I could actually give more effort to the things that I started and never followed through with.  They say that youth is wasted on the young ... and although there is something in this (speaking from my grand old age!!) ... I think I could expand on that statement and say that childhood is wasted on children.  We had all that time (at least we lucky ones did) to play, and spend hours doing nothing but pleasing ourselves.  The hours weren't precisely wasted - this is true - but I think, in hindsight, of all the things that I could have done that, by my age, would have borne fruit. Aside from that, though - who would we warn?  Indeed, would we warn at all?  Would we warn the boy that was killed by a train not to go riding there that afternoon; would we tell the abalone fisherman not to dive that particular night for fear of the White Pointer; would we tell the little girl to lock her window when she went to bed, or the boy not to play cricket that night? I would say no, right here and now ... but who knows what I would do if I was presented with the chance to make that difference?  Wouldn't it be wrong not to?  Wouldn't I have a duty to prevent the harm from occurring if I could?  (Final Destination looms nigh!! As does Back to the Future etc; I think it is a worry when we reference abstract ideas and thought by movies - alas for a postmodern age). We looked at Novel Proprietary Interest in Property Law today; how the human body cannot be owned - not even by ourselves.  They (the Common Law) says that we have  possession  of our body, but we don't have the right to say - sell our organs, or market our genes.  Apparently.  No-one can own corpses either - american courts would say they are quasi-property - in the sense that the executor's of the deceased's have possession of the body in order to give it a proper burial etc, etc - but that no-one actually owns it. I think this is shit: that  no-one can have property in a human body - not even the person to whom it belongs - if indeed it can be said to belong.  Apparently the law dates back to the attempted abolition of slavery - that no-one can OWN another living being - have property in them.  As far  as that goes, of course I agree with it, but when it comes to one's own body - we should be able to do whatever the hell we want with it - down to the selling of organs if that's what we want to do.  Of course there are all kinds of policy issues involved in that - the idea that people could be coerced into selling their organs, that people who could not make a rational decision for themselves could be persuaded to think it was a good idea etc, etc.  But according to the law, the body is just so much lumpish earth (true enough, I suppose in essence) - but that anything that is taken from that body cannot be looked on as conversion (basically stealing something from the possessor under tort law) as a body (particularly a dead body) cannot be owned - not its limbs, its brain, its head.  If someone takes your blood (and this applies to someone who is still alive) and uses it to do something that turns out to be astronomically lucrative then you are not entitled to a share in anything - as once the blood is removed from your body - you no longer own it - indeed, you never owned it to be begin with - you merely had possession of it.  Of course, the law will get around this by saying people need your consent in order to take anything from your body - blood, stem cells from a foetus of your body ... but even if they don't you can't say that they stole anything from you because it doesn't belong to you. Like the poor bastard in the  Moore  case - whose spleen was used to develop a highly valuable and lucrative cell-line.  The doctors didn't say what they were going to use it for, indeed Moore signed documentation saying that he didn't want anything done with it (as it pertained to research) - but they went ahead and did it anyway - and made a hell of a lot of money from it.  And while the courts charged the doctors with breach of fiduciary trust and failure to obtain the patients' consent - they adamantly refused to say that the doctors unlawfully took anything from Moore that he owned.  He didn't own his own organs - no-one can have property in a human body; and he had no cause to plead as if they are not owned - then no-one can steal them - or interfere unlwafully with his property right. Of course, the cell-line created was enormously helpful in saving lives ... but one wonders whether that was uppermost in the doctors' minds when they did what they did - or whether they had their eye on the lucre - I'm betting on the latter.  I wonder what Bentham would say about this - what Kant would say - I already know what Locke would say.
