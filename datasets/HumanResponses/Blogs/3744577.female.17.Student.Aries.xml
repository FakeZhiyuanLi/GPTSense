      I have the biggest problem in the world. I LIKE MY ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS  I'm really afraid that I said something to him over the weekend. Last weekend all my friends and me went to Westport to celebrate my friend Ross's birthday. Well, we scored three handles of alchol (THANKS JENN)and we just started to drink and drink like all night long.  I know that sounds stupid to some people, but we are young stupid kids and we like to drink a lot and see what happens. We were safe about no one could get in their cars, get to loud, their were two people their that didn't drink ect.  Back to the story... I got really drunk realy fast, because I'm a light weight, even though I think I drink more than most of my friends. Well, we are a very horney group and that is just heightened when we are drinking. The only problem with that was that there were only three guys there and two of them were with their girlfriends. So, that left Ross and I have a huge crush on him and I've had it for a very long time. I wasn't the only girl there was also Dina, Lore (hot french exchange student) and Jenn. Well, Lore and Dina got a little to close for comfort and I freaked out. Things get a little fuzzy, but I remember talking to Ross and I don't know if I told him about all of my feelings, but also remember stuff about his penis. I want to talk to my friend, but I'm afraid of what I said and I have no idea what he is thinking, but I do remember one big thing. He told me, "I really value are friendship." What the hell? I don't know what I did to get that said to me, but it only hurt my feelings because only say that to ugly girls. Wellm hopefully we will chill on Friday and he will tell me what exactly I said.   Oh yeah, this is my first post. I hope you enjoy reading about my boring little life. This is as interesting as it is going to get.

      I work at the Museum of Science in the museum Shop and today was my first day of actually working with customers and such. It was actually a lot of fun. The kids were cool and I got to demo a lot of cool merchandise. I love the Airzooka and the Hoverdisck I might have to buy some for my friends and family.  The only problem I have with my job is when all the summer camps come to the store at once and none of the kids have more than $3 to their names, but they still want to buy everything in the store. It gets so crazy in the store and their like a million little kids in your face the entire time. I is so exhausting. Thank goodness that I had my lunch break right when things were getting really crazy. I still had a lot of fun.  I like all my co-workers they are so cool and funny. We were just laughing all day. I really like this guy Jeff he is really cool and kind of cute. Not so much physically cute, but he has that awesome personality that everyone is just drawn to. Yeah he is pretty cool. I really liked my team today Jeff, Liz, Erin, Kurt and Alexis are all very cool I hope I work with them more often.   The only person that gets on my nerves is Susan. She is my supervisor and she gets shackened really quickly and totally favors guys. She reminds me of this teacher at my school Miss Westfall that totally craves male attention like all the time and she doesn't even care if they are underage.   Well, I have to go. I'm off to see Fahrenheit 9/11, with my mom since Ross went to go see it with his sister yesterday.   Have a nice night ya'll

      I'm really enjoying work because I've actually have made a lot of new friends, and that was something I did not want to do. I didn't want to make friends because I knew that we were only going to around each other for a short period of time and I hate having to say goodbye. I've had two hard summers of leavig Akbar and the crew in Michigan and Kyle and the boys during AMA. I mean we are still in touch, but I'm just very sad that I can't see my friends all the time.  Well, I think that I've actually made a friend that I could probably stay friends with beyond work. Her name is Courtney and she is really cool. We like all the same music, shows, magazines and we even have the same middle name. She is really cool and we had a lot of fun today and I was really happy to chill with her and she is going to be around since she is a senior like me and is going to keep on working through the school year.  I see Maroon 5 on Friday and I'm so excited about it! I can't wait! I love their CD and know the words to all the songs and I'm jsut stocked about the whole thing! Courtney is going to the concer too, another thing we have in common.

         I have such a problem with guys! They just seem to dick around with me and like my friends and have no prpblem telling me after we have already hooked up. I hate boys right now. Well, at least the boys in my life and maybe not Ross because all the issues I have with him are internalized and he has no idea he is hurting me.     The other night I had a few of my friends over because my mother was away. It was suppose to be Kristen, Ross and me drinking and having a good time together. The problem occured when we started to talk to Brad online and then he thought that he should come over and spend the night with us. This srewed everything up because the girl to guy ratio was even. So we immediatly were paired up into couples because were already pretty drunk and Ross was consoling Kristen because she was pissed off about her recent break-up. That left Brad and me. I was very drunk and when I'm drunk I'm horney so I was very horney and wanted some and I had this tall piece of man meat that slowly getting very drunk. So Brad and I were doing out thing, and then all four of us were in my bed doing things and slowly killing friendships (not really).      The problem with the whole night is that no one got off. I was very upset. The reason I didn't get off was because I had Ross on my mind the entire time I with Brad and I couldn't stand the fact that my friends were seeing me do certain things with a guy that none of us even like. I mean we despise this boy.     Today I was talking to the outcast and he told me that  the reason that he didn't get off was because he really wanted to be with Kristen. What a stupid FUCK? Kristen actually hates him and he still goes after her like a stupid fool. The worse thing is that he is saying this to me trying not to hurt my feelings because I gave hime the time of day in the first place. I never knew a guy that was that stupid in my life. You never tell your potential botty call anything like that. He is such a dumb FUCK!    Guys, I really hate you guys right now!  Where are all the good guys? I need a guy that can respect me for who I am.  I don't even want to think about what is going on with Ross and Kristen. The thought of it makes me sick and I need someone in my life before I can even think about handling that one.

      Well, summer is going along just fine. I have a kick ass job and I'm just doing the whole teenager thing like chilling with my friends and drinking a lot and nt doing what I should be doing. I need to be doing summer reading and start work on college applications, but I haven't even finalized my college list. I thought I made up my mind but new ideas keep on popping up in my head and it confuses me so much that I don't even know direction I'm going to take my life. For the past four years the plan for me has been to go to college and then go to law school and become a lawyer. This has been the plan, but I don't know if I like this plan . There is something about that seems just too mudane and not the life that is truly me. I'm seek of the boring and the predictable and I want to become someone different and cool, but I guess that is every seventeen year old's and me saying that shows how boring and predictable I really am. I have such conflicting ideas about college, that center around my major, the types of people I want to meet, and my possibe carrer path. I have small liberal arts colleges to large Big 10 schools on my list. The List is forever shricking and expanding, also every school I want to go to for a completely different reason, person, or cause. This whole college thing is slowly giving me a headache and I can't believe that it is almost Septmeber and that is when the real drama is truly going to begin. Thank God I already made the choice not to apply early.
