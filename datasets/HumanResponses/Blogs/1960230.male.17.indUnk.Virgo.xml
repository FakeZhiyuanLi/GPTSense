      Havent posted a post in a while. Had a few things going on. Well Christina came over here on Wensday and hung out and that was Fun!  Thursday tunred out of going to Josh's house to go swimmin and go ridin. Got a ride home from him and sat down for awhile and made a phone call...well that phone call would be the first of many that would be made to Christina's house with no success of reaching her. Well I just said that I would call her on Firday. Well Friday came and went without talking to her, she todl me about plans of hanging out on the weekend at a party. But no luck of reachin her so that was gone. SO I would just call on Saturday morning or so before they left. After returning home from picking my quad back up from the shop, I made another phone call....nothing. Me the way that I think I was like is she purposly not answering my phone calls casue she doesnt want to talk to me!? Well I just sat around knowing that they had to have been gone from their house and went to the party, so I just sat around all day played video games and sat on the computer for awhile. I got an e-mail from the Queen...(Queen Deems) that day around 1 or so, saying that their phone has been messed up sayin that the phone keeps sayin "LINE IS BUSY" so they werent able to receive or send calls out of the house. Well this still is happenin and it is Tuesday. So I have been sittin here waiting for the damn phone to become Un-Busy and be happy and hear her voice and talk to the girl who makes me laugh and calm all at the same time. I just want to hear from her...then I will be happy and relax...that she isnt mad or not answering my phone calls!

      One Month...can show the signs of what a relationship can be like in the upcoming months or even years! I guess you can guess it that it is one month for Christina and I. Well some people would say that "wow one month, no big deal", well I say that one month can be the deciding factor of the realtionship. I have to say the first month....best month of my life...even though we havnt gotten a real chance to see each other as often as we really want..you know conflicting parents getting in the way! Best month of my life, spending all the time I could with her and hanging out at her house and mine. Watching the MTV Movie Awards with her and makinf unf of her for the Clearasil incident!!! Just sittin there holding here while we tear apart people onstage the people getting awards...just great! I hope...I know that the realtionship will be awesome in the future and that we both will have a great time together! Also just Happy One Month, Tina Marie!  Well about me now....nothing at all is going on..besides playing a new video game...I am finaly sleeping more...but that aint helping me too much cause it makes me sleep even more and there goes my day or sleep from 6 to 8 and then up till like fucking 2 or 3! But I guess its worth the extra sleep but I dont know.

      Ok...another post. Well the past few days have been interseting. Well Friday nite got a call to see if I would like to hang out and talk and stuff so yeah of course. They are close family friends so whenever we can get together is cool. Those family friends I heard was talking some good things about me to Christina..about how a great guy I am! I guess some good points for myself. Haha So tha nite was pretty fun. Came home that nite...sat around watched tv for awhile and then got a phone call from someone...someone of very importance to me! Well we talked till like 1.10 in the morning, yeah the latest we have ever talked it was cool. Around that time we decided that we needed sleep so to bed I went.  Next morning got up and went out to Washington to go get a game (Silent Hill 3, will give my thoughts later on) then came home and sat and listend to the CD that came with the game for a bit and then decided that I should play the game. Well Silent Hill 3...great game, graphics are great and the scare factor is pretty good....to see Nurses hanging and shaking and other objects make tons of gross noises...just great. A great game to play in the dark with a friend ;)! I will give the game on my scale of 10 fingers I give it 8 for great graphics and great game play...even though at sometimes shit that you pick up throughout the game doesnt make much of any fucking sense...but is still good!

       Friday  Sorry for the update being this late but you know, its like that when you have things to do and forget about this damn thing. Well lets see this weekend. Awesome as hell, went to the movies with my girl and with 2 friends Josh and Colleen. We saw Anchorman (which I suggest you go see) and that was funny as hell. Before hand we went and traded in a few games of mine to get Driv3r but the guy said that it wasnt that good and also my games that I traded werent worth anything...not that much but if I were to but them towards Spider-Man 2 I would have to only pay 21 bucks...my luck thats all I had! So yeah, spent it on that game, its a good game. So after the movie went out to eat and had fun there makin things with our food and waiting for the waitress to bring our check so we could get Christina home in time. Got her home and in time and we thought she may have been trouble but it was a misunderstanding.    Saturday  Woke up pretty early to find out that The Queen was still going with me to go to PTI for a finaical aid/description of the school. It was great, stuff turned out really nice and the school is awesome. I hope I get accepted casue thats were I want to go, rite after school. To find out that school wouldnt cost that much...thank you government for taking pity on Poor People. (Ok take this note down) The only time I will agree with out government and what they did besides that dont get my started or this whole thing will be filled with bad words and too many points of anger! Ok back to what I was talking about, that school was great I hope to go there. Its close, I dont have to travel that far and its near the Robinson Town Center and all that stuff! Then after leaving Me and The Queen hung out for awhile, went out to eat and then went to the mall. After walking around for awhile we had to take her to her Aunt's house so she could go out to eat later with her family. Well it was a pretty good weekend. Well those 2 days were awesome really didnt do anything that Sunday. Except crash at Josh's house and do stuff with to help his dad. Ok I will say it, I know you probably would never hear it from me but I cant wait to go to school after High School...thats if Im PTI, Im happy to go!

      ..July 3rd, a day before the The United States declared its Independence. We celbrate this occasion with High-Explosives that could kill a few specators or a small child could blow his hand off or his pocket if he so happens to light the damn thing and place inot his pocket like fucking reatred kid that would be. I think that if a kid thinks its ok to light a firework and place into there pocket...they shouldnt have fireworks in the first place. Were are the fucking parents to this kids...Damn people RAISE YOUR KIDS RITE! 2 kids were playing with some firecrackers and with there 5 little puppies...well they placed the firecrackers into the little Labs' mouths and blew a few of their faces off...well the ones who survived they used them as targets for bottle rocket practice...I swear these kids need to be placed in a room, jamm firecrackers inot their mouths and set off, see how they like it! Alrite I think I got out my emotion about that subject. Now onto what happend last nite...  ..Well last nite Christina (THE QUEEN) came over and we headed off to Gordon residence to watch fireworks. Well we got there awhile before the explosions we set to be let off. So we played a sweet little game called 13 (Thirteen) for the Gamecube, good game..first ever First Person Shooter that is Cel-Shaded. We were playing Multiplayer against each other, while playing there was this little Reaper lookin thing singin love songs and singing about getting away without getting caught...GOD WAS IT SCARY. If you were mistakingly run into this little bitch you would be killed instantly! So after be upseted by Josh's cheating we were outside to watch fireworks. Josh's dad said the best view would be the roof....so we headed to the roof to sit and get the best view in town. While sittin up there waiting for the show to being was a great nite outside...sittin next to my girl just watchin was just Awesome...during the last part of the show I was gonna say something to Christina but I was destracted by the pretty colors! LOL ;) I have to say that was a great nite, after getting her home safe and sound..I told her that I wanted to tell her something when we were on the roof but didnt get a chance to..I told her that I loved her..and yeah! Haha Well we are happy as ever and I am very happy!  Lets see..doing nothing today...yeah its 4th of July but I have no plans of going anywere...The Queen went with her family to party which I was Uninvited to b/c of reasons that the governments is not lettin me say. So I will keep it hush hush!
