      Just when u think things cant get any worse....That's when life comes back and slaps you in the face...Its kinda funny how life works......One moment you can be soo happy...The next you can  be crying your eyes out.....And then feeling like you wanna  kill everyone and everything that pisses  you off....How you can go from one extreme to another.....Just wanting to give up on everything.....Just wanting everything but the things that make u happy to all go away....Just wishing that you could die and go to heaven...It really sucks living the life that I do.....So many things going though my head all at the same time.....Jarred......Brady......Al...Mel.....Wanting to throw my mom out of the widow...And hoping she breaks a hip......Tuesday night.......4th of July.....Wishing I could get out of here...Wishing I could just get away.....Wishing I could just die.....Wanting to just live in peace.......i wish jarred would call me right now......Just so I can smile.....Just to hear his voice.....Just to be able to get away for that one moment.....It just bein me and him talkin on the phone....That would make me soo happy....So as I hear from Mel.....Jarred does like me.......But just doesn't want a relationship at the moment.....God the things I would do just to be able to feel myself in his arms.....That would be soo wonderful....So great......But as I see it I can never get what I want.....And its been like that my whole life....So im surprised I haven't gotten used to it by now....But whatever....im done....Later

      Well....Um...Last night I got a lil tipsy.....Then today...I get this phone call from a guy that I had slept with and he was trippin about how there could be a possibility  that i could be pregnate,...Even though there isn't....And if I was what I would do....And that if I decided to actually have the kid...If I was pregate.....That he would be there  for me no matter hat......Which makes me feel good.....Sense ill know that he'll be there for me...But its kinda scary at the same time...Cause it makes me think abut it too.....So I guess ill say that is was kinda scary...But reassuring that he'll be there.....So I guess ill go....Till next time....Talk to u later!
