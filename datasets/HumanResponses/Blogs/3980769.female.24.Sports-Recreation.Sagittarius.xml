      ...and I'm not even 25 yet.   Thursday July 22, 2004   T-minus 5 months 23 days 'til Sister Sandy turns the big 2-5, mark your calendars...it's not going to be pretty! One word...trouble.  While I'm in the counting down mood...only 22 more days 'til the opening ceremonies.  But more importantly...only 26 more working days as an intern. Yahooooo! There will be dancing in the parking lot at 4:30pm on the 27th of Aug. Feel free to join me! But please RSVP.  &nbsp;  So remember that wacky Canadian TV show You Can't Do That On Television? They always got slimed for saying some word. I can't remember what it was. Was the word "slime"? Someone's got to remember and let me know or this is going to kill me. And Alanis Morissette was also on that show, but I could never quite remember which one she was. The only person I remember is that guy Alister, because I thought his name was dumb.   So has everyone seen the movie Signs by M. Night Shamanamablahblahblah? I only found that movie to be somewhat scary after moving to Illinois. When you live in San Diego for 5 years, you really don't get the whole scary cornfield idea. Jaws I understand, cornfields not so much. Speaking of signs, I believe in them. Like when you're trying to make a major life decision and someone makes a comment, which happens to be a lyric of a song sung by my fianceé(and the title of this entry). Even though that title may refer to a certain Peachtree State, if the song lyrics are read as a whole, things point the other direction. (Haha take that!)   Which leads me to my next point...all major decisions should be decided by the flip of a coin. Head I win, tails you lose. Heads Carolina, tails California.   Song/funny thought of the day:  The Outkast "Poo Poo" song, sung by the one and only Evan while at the velodrome yesterday. For those of you unfamiliar with Evan AKA Old Man Covantry, imagine a crazy Aussie busting out in random songs at any given moment. I guess you had to be there. But trust me, it was funny.   So I was told that people only continue to read blogs that make mention of them. Now this may prove difficult for me, considering the enormous amount of friends, family, admirers, stalkers I have, but every now and again I will try to drop a few names so people stay intrigued by my site. T-Dawg. Look I think I just covered about 15 people right there. Which T-Dawg was I referring to? Unimportant. But if your name starts w/ a T, I could be talking about you. UCSD/WIU Swimmer. Ok there's 60 more down. Man this is easier than I thought it would be.   Last thought of the day...Why Georgia why. Question or statement? I don't&nbsp;know either!  &nbsp;   I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.  -Sister Sandy

      Wednesday July 21, 2004  &nbsp;  It was suggested to me (by a certain unnamed internet marketing intern, who resides in the room right next to mine) that instead of sending out e-mails, that I should establish a weblog. That way everyone on the internet, not just the few recipients of my personalized e-mails, could read my daily ramblings. And so, this my friends may be the end of my e-mails. However, it also the start of a new “blog”. Here’s the address for the site…bookmark it! I’ve included some of my archived e-mails for those of you who may have missed the first few. The progression is fascinating, starting from a simple weather update to the masterpieces they have become.  &nbsp;  Enjoy.  &nbsp;  Oh and about the weather-reporting thing…for the rest of the summer it’s going to be nice in the morning and crappy in the afternoon. Expect rain, hail, lightning, thunder and it will all start right when you get off of work.  &nbsp;  It’s that time of day again, where I run out of things to do and it’s not even 1pm yet.   So why is it, that just when you think you’ve got everything in life figured out and life is going great and you know where you’re headed, you always hit a speed bump and things get thrown everywhere? Like I said before, if I never drive over another speedbump in my life, it will be too soon.  &nbsp;  So I was thinking about Girl Scout cookies this morning. I don’t know why, but I was. I think you have to be in certain moods to enjoy certain GS cookies. For example, I usually want a caramel delight in the evening w/ some milk to dip them in. Whereas a peanut butter pattie is good around lunchtime w/ a sandwich. Now thin mints, they’re good all the time. Especially after a long evening out on the town, when you come home stumbling in and have the munchies and there they are in the freezer staring you down….mmmmm. And why are they named differently across the country. Some places they're called caramel delights other places samoas. I think the peanut butter sandwiches are called savannas someplaces too. I think the GS could make a killing if they were to open up a GS cookie store online. That way you could have the cookies year round and not just in March. Maybe I should write them a letter…I have the time.  &nbsp;  Speaking of seasonal treats, my favorite time of year is Christmas. Only because that’s when Mint M&M’s hit the grocery store shelves. If you haven’t tried them, you’re missing out. My friend Molly clued me in about 3 Christmas’ ago and I thought she was a nut because she has a whole cupboard stockpiled full for the rest of the year. But little did I know that someday I too would be buying up package after package because once January comes, Mint M&amp;M’s are no where to be found.  Christmas is also a good time of year because my mom lives in California. And winter there means a chilly daytime high of only 50 or so. Brrr. Don’t you wish your mom lived in California!  &nbsp;  California is also home of the best cheese. And best cheese commercials.(Good cheese comes from happy cow. Happy cows come from California!)&nbsp;And Monterey, where my brother lives, is a big producer of mushrooms. And California also grows lots of strawberries and avocados and almonds and artichokes. And just down the road from my house in SJ is Gilroy, Garlic Capitol of the World. (Actually Fresno, Ca produces more garlic, but don’t tell the folks in Gilroy that!) Some days when the wind is blowing just right from the south, you can catch a whiff of garlic from my house in SJ. And our governor can beat up your governor. And where else can you sit in a car for 2 hours and drive 5 miles…only in California. And did you know I used to surf to school. And Baywatch is totally what it’s like everywhere in California. And they say people from Texas are proud of their state. I’d like to see what Texas has that California doesn’t! (Sorry Jenise!)  &nbsp;  So has anyone seen the talk/news show Good Day Live? Man, what great tv. I used to watch it back when I lived in San Diego. We would get the LA stations and it was called Good Day LA then. Then, one day, while I was minding my own business in tiny Macomb, IL, flipping through the channels, procrastinating studying and low and behold what should jump across my tv set…but Steve, Dorothy and Jillian. They got syndicated and changed the name of their show, but it’s still the same ol’ gang. Steve got a star on the walk of fame you know. good times with the Good Day Live. &nbsp;  A quick shout out to my girl D-Roz for her awesome e-mail this yesterday on pizza and M&M’s, which actually inspired my writings on Mint M&amp;M’s.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm out.

      Monday July 19, 2004   I’m trying out a new title for my random e-mails...haven’t decided if I like this one or not...we’ll see if I (or any of you) can come up w/ something better. Side Note: I find it funny that people here call me Sandy because the only other person to call me Sandy was Dr. Spencer. That was ok w/ me since he gave out the grades and is one of my references, so I figured he could call me whatever he wanted. And the nickname Sister Sandy, given lovingly by Mike "I live to give" Dumas after my lack of going out, is also kinda humorous to me. I’m telling you, you should have known me as an undergrad in SD. One word...trouble. I'm slowing down in my old age.  Sister Sandy Says...Good times with the webster.com. Here’s a list of some "new" words recently added to the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.  menudo (noun) 1929 : a tripe stew seasoned with chili peppers  Or that crazy 80’s band in tight jeans with little Ricky Martin. If anyone has their CD, please burn me a copy!  dream catcher (noun) 1989 : a circular framed net with a hole in the center that is used by some American Indian peoples to help block bad dreams and catch good ones  Or a book by Stephen king that was made into a movie. Read the book, only watched part of the movie...SSDD(Same Sh--, Different Day) sounds like my internship.  pleather (noun) 1982 : a plastic fabric made to look like leather  Or what I wore for New Years in 2001 at GS’s house, 2002 at Christian’s house (the swimmer not the LOUD cyclist), and 2003 in SF...I actually have not one, but two pairs of pleather pants (they’re somewhere in storage in Iowa)...ah, good times in the pleather pants...I think...at least that’s what I was told...keep in mind, all this debauchery was well before I decided to join the nunnery.   Sister Sandy Says...we don’t need no education...but here’s the word of the day anyway.  mendacious • \men-DAY-shus\ adjective  : given to or characterized by deception or falsehood or divergence from absolute truth  Did you know?  "Mendacious" and "lying" have very similar meanings, but the two are not interchangeable. "Mendacious" is more formal and literary, suggesting a deception harmless enough to be considered bland. "Lying" is more blunt, accusatory, and often confrontational. You might yell, "You lying rat!" in an argument, but you would most likely stick to the more diplomatic, "Aren’t you being somewhat mendacious?" in a business meeting. "Mendacious" can also imply habitual untruthfulness, whereas "lying" is more likely to be used to identify specific incidences of dishonesty.   SSS...On my way to work today, I heard one of my favorite song...Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd.In case your unfamiliar with PF, the last lyrics of that song go something like this..."How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, running over the same old ground. What have we found? The same old fears, wish you were here." Now go w/ me on this one, it’s kinda a stretch.   After hearing the song, I started thinking about fish bowls and margaritas served in a giant fish bowls. And I was reminded of this place in Macomb where you can get margaritas in big fish bowl size glasses. There’s one margarita, I can’t remember the name but it’s blue and had some clever ocean/water/shark type name, and at the bottom is a gummie shark. Usually the shark was nearly frozen and harder than a rock, so you never actually ate the gummie shark, but it added a nice touch to the margarita. And I was thinking, we need to go to that Mexican food place on Tejon and get margaritas. They claim to have the world’s largest, but I’m skeptical. I’ll supply the gummie sharks.   Speaking of margaritas...my last year in SD we would have Margarita Sunday w/ the freshmen. It’s pretty much self-explanatory, we would get together on Sundays and have margaritas. But I would say that those were some of the best margaritas I’ve ever had. Or maybe it was just the company that made the margaritas good. Either way, I really could go for a margarita right now...hey, it’s 5 o’clock somewhere.   Ok so Pink Floyd reminds me of Randall "Pink" Floyd of Dazed and Confused. That movie has so many great lines and Matthew McConaughey is so sleazy he just makes the movie...alright alright alright...now fry like bacon you little freshman piggies. FRY(I think I actually said that to our freshmen-but just so it's on the record, hazing is wrong and UCSD never hazed it's freshmen swimmers!)...I wanna dance(or do I remember Even saying that at some point?)...it'd be a lot cooler if you did...I keep getting older, they stay the same age(I KNOW one of the boys said that about the jr. synchro team last week)...ok guys, one more thing, this summer when you're being inundated with all this American bicentennial Fourth of July brouhaha, don't forget what you're celebrating, and that's the fact that a bunch of slave-owning, aristocratic, white males didn't want to pay their taxes...(I just like the word brouhaha).   Amazing that I can recite quotes to a movie that I only watch during (or after) a long night of imbibmentness (yes, that is a word!)  Back to work...or back to pretending to work. Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle...here we go again!   Be sure to drink your ovaltine...   Sister Sandy  –ss

      Friday July 16, 2004   I love casual Friday...it makes me happy going to work in jeans, flip flops and a tank top...almost as happy as when they have those awesome brownie/cake/chocolatelygoodness things in the cafeteria. Mmmm!   Today is going to be full of random thoughts and a little bit of soapboxin’. But first, today’s weather.   Flash flood warning for those of us here in the Springs until later tonight. That means lots of puddles and a free carwash.  Today: A 40 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms. Mostly cloudy, with a temperature falling to around 72 by 5pm.  Tonight: A 40 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms, mainly before midnight. Partly cloudy, with a low around 56.   As for you non-Springs residents...sorry, I was limited in the time I could check out non-work related websites. My new desk and computer configuration doesn’t allow me to surf the web as frequently as I would like. The only time I can go to fun websites, like noaa.org, is when the financial person leaves her/my office. (we share and office...sharing is caring!)   So about this whole Martha Stewart business. Why do people love to hate her? She’s the freakin’ coolest person ever. You can’t tell me you wouldn’t want to get invited to one of her parties up at Turkey Hill. Man, think of the food. And the awesome centerpieces made out of flowers, freshly picked from her garden! So they decided to send her to the pokey for 5 months. All for saving a lousy $51,000, when she was worth over $1 Billion. That’s a B as in Boy did she get screwed. And the Enron boys...they better freakin’ get the book thrown at them. They lost millions and millions of other people’s money...myself included! And then there’s OJ! He killed his wife for goodness sakes. And he didn’t have to go to jail for 5 months. But poor Martha. Just because she's a rich and powerful women, "The Man" was trying to keep her down...I wonder if the USOC was involved in the Martha case at all. Hmmm. Anyone for some frozen yogurt?   Next random thought...Remember 90210. Ahh the good old days. The friends before Friends...I think one of my favorite episodes was when they weren’t going to let Donna graduate because she got drunk at prom. The entire school decided to chant, "Donna Martin graduates!". Or when Emily Valentine sets fire to the float in the Walsh’s front yard. Or when the Dyan’s girlfriend, the Noxima girl, was shot...by her own dad, when she was driving Dylan’s car. And he’s holding her in the rain, yelling to the sky, "Why? Why?". Such drama! too many favorites to choose from. Aaron Spelling, what a genius! Who else could come up with shows like 90210, Melrose Place, Dallas and 7th Heaven. Speaking of 7th Heaven...when I was an undergrad back in SD, my roommates and I would play the 7th Heaven "Guess-the-lesson-of-this-episode game...because there’s always a lesson on that show. Ya'll should try it. And who says the WB doesn’t put out quality tv shows.   More randomness. Remember when pagers were cool. Yeah, that’s right, I had a pager. (Flashback to Real World Season 1 when Julie asks if Heather sells drugs because she has a pager. Classic!) And pager language... the text messaging before there were text messages. Where a 4 could be an A, F or H depending on who you’re paging. 58170158   These are just some of the thoughts that go through my head as I’m trying to shuffle papers and look busy. Sometimes, just to REALLY look busy, I open up a binder, take things out and put them back in again. Clever I know.   Yeah Friday! Have a good one.   Your weekly provider of randomness,  Sandra

      Tuesday July 13, 2004   I’m finding that waking up early is depleting my creative writing skills. I’ve been lacking the motivation to write any sort of funny, interesting, informative e-mails the past two days. Someone please tell me again why I have to wake up so freakin’ early! Oh yeah, the USOC (AKA "The Man") is trying to keep down the little guys (us interns- do they know we were chosen out of 750,000 applicants?). Closing the weight room at 5pm…what were they thinking? We’re the backbone of this organization. Without us, who would make copies, send faxes, fetch our supervisors coffee? More importantly, what would Jan do on Tuesday mornings? The Games wouldn’t happen next month if it weren’t for us. I say we boycott something…anything. Maybe the frozen yogurt machine in the cafeteria. That’s it. No more frozen yogurt until they start listening to our demands about the weight room. Who’s with me? Down with The Man!   For all of you thinking of heading out to OC’s tonight…check out the word of the day.   peccant • \PEK-unt\ adjective *1 : guilty of a moral offense : sinning 2 : violating a principle or rule : faulty  Example sentence:  The minister delivered a stern sermon warning peccant parishioners of the punishments that awaited them in the afterlife.  Did you know?  "Peccant" comes from the Latin verb "peccare," which means "to sin," "to commit a fault," or "to stumble," and is related to the better-known English word "peccadillo" ("a slight offense"). Etymologists have suggested that "peccare" might be related to the Latin "ped-, pes," meaning "foot." A related Latin adjective, "peccus," may have been used to mean "having an injured foot" or "stumbling." Whether or not a connection truly exists between "peccant" and "peccus," "peccant" itself involves stumbling of a figurative kind making errors, for example, or falling into immoral, corrupt, or sinful behavior.  (or stumbling up the stairs from OC’s!)   As for the weather…it’s freakin’ hot out. But I wouldn’t know, because I’m here in a nicely over AC’ed office, set to a slightly cool 64 degrees. According to the National Weather Service, it’s currently 87 in the Springs…31C for all you wacky Aussies. You and your metric system. Wait a second, is Celsius metric or some other strange, non-American measuring system? Anyway, it’s supposed to stay HOT all week. (Did anyone else notice how warm it was this morning, say around 6am. Yeah, that’s right, I was up. On my way to work out. Damn The Man!)   ATTENTION: SPECIAL WEATHER UPDATE!  There’s been some crazy tornado activity out in the MidWest this afternoon, mostly in the Missouri and Illinois areas. Good thing we’re not there!   Happy Tuesday. Yeah for no work tomorrow. I’m so excited to learn CPR…AGAIN. I love watching those Red Cross videos, quality acting!   Teaser for tomorrow…  Are you ok, go call 911, ABC (airway, breathing, circulation) 15/2, 3/1, 24/7, 2-4-9er…did I catch a niner in there?   Happy Tuesday.

      Friday July 9, 2004   As requested by my OK roomie (get it, she’s from Oklahoma so she’s OK...ha) I decided to forgo the weather for today and give you all a bit of an education lesson today. I shall now give you the WORD OF THE DAY!  lackadaisical • \lak-uh-DAY-zih-kul\ adjective : lacking life, spirit, or zest : languid  Example sentence:Disgusted by his team's performance during their losing streak, the coach gave a lecture scolding them for their lackadaisical play.  Did you know? Alas, alack, there are times when life seems to be one unfortunate occurrence after another. We’ve all had days when nothing seemed to go right. When folks had one of those days back in the 17th century, they'd cry "Lackaday" to express their sorrow and disappointment. "Lackaday" was a shortened form of the expression "alack the day." In the mid-1700s, "lackadaisical" was coined through addition of the suffix "-ical." The word "lackadaisy" also saw usage around that time as an interjection similar to "lackaday," and this word, though never as prevalent as "lackaday," might have influenced the coinage of "lackadaisical."   There now, don’t you feel smarter already! There will be no paper shuffling today, because I have a computer to use. My LONG list of tasks for the day include, printing out 4 documents, answering the 2 e-mails I had (work related!) completing my journal logs for school and sending out this educational update for all of you. So what did my journal logs for school say I did this morning… "After revising the ad compilations for the upcoming summer edition of USA Water Polo The Magazine, I proceeded to e-mail and fax a copy of my revisions to the representatives of each group involved in the conference call yesterday. I also sent out a notice to our previous advertisers, reminding them of the magazine’s July 15th deadline to submit new advertisements. Otherwise existing advertisements will be used. BLAH BLAH BLAH"   Ok so things are going rather slow here in the office. But today is Friday and in 4 hours I’ll have 2 whole days off, yahoo! Plans for the weekend…I’m thinking some hiking, if it doesn’t rain.   Which lead me to…tada…today’s weather report. And you all thought you would have to wait until next week. I tricked you!  I’ve expanded my list of recipients of this e-mail, not limiting it to only USOC interns, so I shall have to expand my weather report as well. Maybe in the future I’ll throw in some hometown weather updates too, but lets not get ahead of ourselves.  For the Springs…This Afternoon: A 20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms after 3pm. Partly cloudy, with a high near 85.  – Notice I included the percent chance, wouldn’t want anyone getting upset over my false reports!!  Tonight: A 30 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms before midnight. Mostly cloudy, then gradually becoming mostly clear, with a low around 58. New rainfall amounts between a tenth and quarter of an inch possible.  – So basically it might rain, but maybe not. But if it does rain, it really won’t be rain, more of a gentle rainfall. No umbrellas needed!  On to the national weather… Florida is looking hot, especially with that crazy heat index. Better put on the sunblock if you’re hitting up the links. Or drink a few cold ones to cool yourselves down!  Macomb, Il is getting dumped on w/ rain. I bet the mighty Lamoine is going to flood. And it’s hot too, w/ a ridiculous heat index. Temps in the 90’s.  Ahh San Diego. Let’s see if I remember this correctly...morning fog on the coast, burning off by early afternoon, a high of 75 with beautiful sunshine and a crisp 65 over night low. Yeah that sounds about right.   The Bay Area (or like my friend e-40 calls it, the Yay Area) looks to have some heat with a high in the 80’s. Not to worry, it’ll cool off tonight to a low of 55, so bring your sweaters with you if you go out clubbin’!   As you can tell I’ve had some free time on my hands. But hey, everyone in the office thinks I’m working hard w/ all the typing I’ve been doing...writing this e-mail!   Happy Friday! Sandra

      Wednesday July 7, 2004  Back by popular demand...  According to the NOAA website, today's forecast looks like...  This Afternoon: Partly cloudy, with a high near 86. South southeast wind around 11 mph becoming west southwest.  Tonight: Mostly clear, with a low around 56. West wind between 7 and 10 mph becoming calm. Wait, so it's not going to rain, I don't believe it!Right now it's 82 in the Springs...and it's a cool 70 in my office! As for the rest of the week...They're calling for a chance of thunderstorms everyday...brilliant, I could have told you that!(If you have some free time, I suggest visiting the NOAA website at  urlLink www.noaa.org . The image of the day is a satellite view of the huge fires burning in Alaska, it's amazing!)  On a side note, the John Mayer/Maroon 5 concert last night was AWESOME! I totally suggest for everyone to go see a concert at Red Rocks at some point. The acoustics are phenomenal and the views are breathtaking!   Also, I'd like to take this time to announce my engagement to Johnny. You can all now refer to me as the future Mrs. John Mayer. We're registered at the USOC gift shop. Send any gifts to room 302!  Thank you! Sandra Weather Update Girl

      Monday June 28, 2004  Just thought all of you could use another word in your vocabulary...I never knew how much fun  urlLink www.webster.com  could be! The Word of the Day for June 28 is:  vouchsafe • \vouch-SAYF\ • verb  *1 a : to grant or furnish often in a gracious or condescending manner  b : to give by way of reply  2 : to grant as a privilege or special favor  Example sentence:"If he passed near enough to speak . . . a ‘Morning, Miss Grey,’ or some such brief salutation, was usually vouchsafed." (Anne Brontë, Agnes Grey)  Did you know?Shakespeare fans are well acquainted with "vouchsafe." The word, which was borrowed with its present meaning from Anglo-French in the 14th century, pops up fairly frequently in the Bard's work. (60 times, to be exact!) "Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love," beseeches Proteus of Silvia in The Two Gentlemen of Verona. "Vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food," King Lear begs his daughter Regan. But you needn’t turn to Shakespeare to find "vouchsafe." The daily papers will do. Here’s one example: "He hoped to actually witness an eagle catching a fox. This was not vouchsafed to him on that first trip. . . ." (John Derbyshire, Washington Times, January 4, 2004).

      Friday July 30, 2004  This morning I sent out an e-mail to all of our current members with an e-mail address listed in our database. That’s over 11,00 members. I’m quite the popular intern this morning because so far I’ve gotten over 700 e-mails in less than 4 hours. Nevermind the fact that they’ve all been undeliverable because the user is unknown or it’s returned mail or an "I’m out of the office" auto-responses. I’m still getting’ some e-mail lovin’! How many e-mails did you get today??  Blue jean baby. LA lady.  Since I’m the type who likes to countdown…I found this awesome website, onlineconversion.com. Anywho, it has place where you can put in your birthday and how old you want to be when you retire and it tells you how many days you have left!!! Only 12920 more days and I’m done with work forever…9229 actual working days! The website can also calculate how old you are in dog years…I’m only 2.75. But if I were a 24-year-old dog, I’d be 109 in human years. Bow wow!  It’s a goofy thing but I just have to say, hey, I’m a doin’ alright.  Wanting to find out what this weekend’s weather is going to be like, I cruised on over to the NOAA.org website. At the top of the page was the following article…  July 28, 2004 — NOAA scientists made a rare sighting this month in Alaskan waters. From the deck of the NOAA research vessel McArthur II, they spotted and positively identified rare and endangered blue whales, Balaenoptera musculus, the largest animals known to live on Earth. "For whale researchers, this is huge," said Jay Barlow, NOAA's chief scientist on the research cruise.  Does anyone else find the humor in this? Largest animals on earth, huge news. HAHA. It made me laugh out loud.  Now I know I have to (clap clap) runaway.  I’m a fan of the weather channel. Ever since I moved to Illinois, I watch it whenever I get the chance. Typically, in the morning before I head out to swim practice, I switch it on and see what the day’s going to be like. Local on the 8’s. Brilliant. Your local weather every time that little minute hand hits the 8. Now, when I lived in San Diego, watching the weather channel didn’t make much sense. Foggy in the morning. Beautiful sunshine in the afternoon. Clouds roll in around 5ish. You can set your watch to it. But Illinois, whoa Nelly! It could be beautiful sunshine and –10 degrees out. That’s why I count on Bob Stokes, the Asian weatherman. He’s awesome. He’s by far my favorite on the Weather Channel. Jim Cantore is a close 2nd, only because he does the weather live on-location. BTW it’s channel 55 in Macomb.  Happy Friday! 20 more days...  And just when it hit me, somebody turned around and shouted… Sandra

      Thursday July 29, 2004   Wow, what a great morning. You know when you wake up and know it’s just going to be a great day, I live for days like this. If only I didn’t have to waste it being stuck in an office all day. And it’s sooo nice outside. Finally, a day where it doesn’t look like the sky is going to open up and swallow the whole city of Colorado Springs. It’s days like this that make me miss swimming/coaching outside.   And so I have to say before I go, that I just want you to know…   When I lived back in San Diego, America’s Finest City, I watched the sunrise four days a week. Depending on the year, sometimes five. There’s nothing more awesome than seeing the sun come up over the eucalyptus trees, through the morning fog, while wearing red goggles. If there’s one thing I miss about SD, it’s those sunrises. Not so much the swimming part while watching the sun come up, but the simple beauty of the start of a new day. I feel bad for all those swimmers who live anyplace other than California-or maybe Florida- and have to get up at 5:30am for practice, never having the opportunity to watch the sun rise. Stupid indoor pools. Sometimes, when I was coaching in Illinois and the kids were in the middle of a long morning set, I would walk over to the door and stand outside to catch the sun coming up over Vince Grady Field. If I was lucky, there would be a little bit of fog hovering over the grass, creating a Canyonview Pool-like sunrise. Almost as good as SD, but not the same.   Is it your eyes? Is it your smile? All I know is that you’re drivin’ me wild.   And nothing beats a sunset over the ocean. Sunsets over mountains, like the ones here in the Springs, are almost as good, but not the same. There’s no green flash in the Springs. If you ever have the chance to visit SD, head up to La Jolla, near the gliderport and UCSD and watch the sunset at the cliffs. Awesome. I spent many evenings my first year at UCSD at the cliffs. Good times. Man do I miss San Diego.&nbsp;   I actually have some work to do today. Unbelievable. Although, I have a few days to finish it, so I better pace myself. Wouldn’t want to get it done too quickly. Then it would be back to staring at a blank wall again. And I don’t think I can take much more of that. Maybe I should put stuff up on the wall, just so it’s not a blank wall I’m staring at, rather a wall up stuff on it.   Vegas…Labor Day…Cesar’s Palace…I’m there. Hopefully. I’ll let you know.   Ghetto superstar, that is what you are.  Sandra

      Wednesday July 28, 2004  Ahhh, another day, another dollar. What to talk about today. Let’s see… on my drive to work today I heard the song Burn, by Usher and I started thinking about the wildfires out in California. And then I started thinking about how I’m glad there aren’t any fires here in Colorado. I guess it’s because of all of these freaky rainstorms we’ve had ALL SUMMER LONG.&nbsp;If I had to choose between rain or fire, I’d have to choose rain. I just wish it would rain while I’m at work and not start at 4:30, right when I’m finished. Rain, rain go away. Come again some other day!  So excuse me forgetting but these things I do. You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue.  So here I am sitting at my desk, wondering how the heck can I get out of here. I think our office is in some strange time continuum where time passes slower than normal, where a second really lasts an hour. That’s what it feels like.&nbsp;I don’t know how I’m going to make it through 23 more days of this. But I’ve hatched a plan…food poisoning. Very bad food poisoning. I need a volunteer to go through it with me, so it doesn’t look suspicious. I’m thinking I''l be out at least a week. And this mysterious food poisoning will definitely have to coincide with the Olympics. Who’s with me?  Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean, yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen.  Do you ever wonder what happened to that little kid from Mary Poppins? Michael Banks. I mean, sure, he had a great career as a dopey kid in a bunch of Disney movies after that, but I wonder what he’s doing now. Hmm time for a little google searchin’ fun! Ok, well, I’m sorry to inform you but he died. Way back in 1977. Oh well. What’s next.   Let's go fly a kite Up to the highest height…  I heard a crazy rumor that they’re remaking my all-time favorite movie…Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. And Johnny Depp is going to play Willy Wonka. What’s up with that? There will only ever be one Willy, and that’s Gene Wilder. He’s a genius. Who else can pull off a purple, crushed velvet tux, besides maybe the artist formerly know as Prince. (actually I think he’s back to Prince again) There’s only one scene in that movie that I can’t stand. It’s the Cheer Up Charlie song, where his mom is over a big cauldron of clothes, stirring it with an oversized wooden fork. I always fast forward through that part. BORING! My little brother actually used to look like Charlie, but with brown hair. He had this fro when he was little and he was dead on ringer for Charlie. And because of that movie, I make my percent sign, like Charlie’s teacher does. "Good lad, pour." The new movie better not suck.  And don't forget the name: Everlasting Gobstopper.

      Tuesday July 27, 2004  I consider myself a pretty simple person. Little things make me happy. I get excited when they have green apples and non-fat yogurt in the dinning hall at breakfast. I’m easily pleased. Some people may say, simple minds, simple pleasures. I’d just like to think that I’m trying to keep a positive spin on my life. However, when the dining hall decided to have crappy food, like last night, I get kinda pissed. I mean, I work hard all day, and all I want is to comeback to the dorms and have some Oreo cookie toppings for my vanilla 2% ice milk. Is that too much to ask? Someone find me a comment card! I’m feeling a strongly worded letter coming on.  Ah yeah I'm superman, a three-piece suit and masterplan. Here I come to save the day!  A bit of friendly advice from Sister Sandy…Bottles of red wine should be shared with friends. They should never be consumed by one person. Not on New Years (even if you are in San Francisco), not within a 30 minute time frame, and especially not before going out to Pacific Beach with crew boys! Red wine goes well with pizza. As does beer. But red wine and beer, not such a good idea. Unless your goal is to forget the evening, in which case, let me suggest Rosemont Shiraz from Australia and some refreshing Coors Light. If you drink two bottle of this fine Aussie treat, along with that great Colorado original (in a red cup of course), you’ll not only have trouble driving home the next morning, but your flight back (to say, Illinois) won’t be so pleasant either. Not that I’d know. I’ve just heard.  Red, red wine you make me feel so fine. You keep me rocking all of the time.  I’m a sucker for a sappy movie. I used to think it was totally not cool to cry at movies. But then I came to terms with my movie cryin’ ways and decided, you know what, it’s ok. Although, sometimes I think I get too emotional over movies. Say for instance, Saving Private Ryan. Not a movie you’d think someone would cry at. Skip to the last chapter, when Matt Damon is over a dying Tom Hanks and then they fade to the old man Matt Damon over a grave stone. Tears. Gushing. I don’t even have to watch the whole movie. Or Meet Joe Black. I think the entire last hour of that movie I had kleenex in my hand. When she was dancing at the party with her dad and she knew he was going to die. Sniff. I’m getting teary just thinking about it. I think it’s the dancing. There’s something very romantic about dancing. And I’m not talking drunk on the dance floor at the ____(fill in the name of your college club here). I’m talking about coming home and dancing in the living room, when it’s just you and the other person, slow dancing like you’re at prom. Sounds cheesy, but trust me, for this hopeless romantic, I still smile when I think about it Like I said before, I’m easily pleased. And another thing, if a guy doesn’t open the door for you on a date, especially a first date, can him. And guys, if she doesn’t attempt to unlock the door for you, get rid of her too. Now if she makes an effort to unlock the door, but with the way new cars are set up these day, she can’t figure out how to unlock the door, cut her a break. I guess it’s a personal decision as to where the fine line is when he can stop opening the door for you and have it be ok. But I have a guy friend who still to this day, opens the door for me EVERY time we get in his car. And we’re not even dating. He’s just like that.  I want to stand with you on a mountain. I want to bathe with you in the sea.  I’m one of those people who can remember the exact place and time I heard a certain song. Say for instance…Date Rape by Sublime. That song reminds me of HS and blasting the song in Jamie Pastor’s white convertible VW bug. Dy’er Mak’er by Led Zeppelin will always remind me of Canyonview pool at UCSD. Fuel by Metallica will always make me think of my first Saturday swim practice at UCSD and 2001 NCAA’s in Ohio. The Reason by Hoobastank. I used to really like that song. Had some good memories from earlier in the summer when I was in SD. Now makes me cringe because it reminds me of sitting here at the office, staring blankly at my computer, wishing I was somewhere, anywhere, else.  The window burns to light the way back home. A light that warms no matter where they’ve gone. They’re off to find the hero of the day.  I wonder what happened to Boys II Men. They were so cool in the early 90’s. With classics like End of the Road, I’ll Make Love to You, It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday &amp; Motownphilly, and then, nothing. Dropped off the face of the boy (correction, men) band world. I know you all danced to at least one Boyz II Men song back in junior high…or maybe elementary school for some of you youngin’s. Good times at the junior high dances.  And still those voices are calling from far away. Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say…  In closing, I’d just like to say, that if nothing else, I’ve written over 12 pages (size 10 font) worth of random crap on the job so far. Maybe I’ll hit 25 by the end of the summer. I’d like to call this my Blog Tour sponsored by OC’s (that’s Oh Crap I have to go to work again, not Old Chicago’s). Have a good one.  Life is not tried it merely survived if you’re standing outside the fire. Sandra

      Monday July 26, 2004  Ahhh, another fine Monday in the Springs. How’d it get to be the end of July already? It feels like I just got here. Ok not really, but I thought I would say that anyway. Only 18 more days until the Olympics and I’m starting to get excited. I mean, with the Tour over, what else is there to watch in the dining hall? (Mad props to my boy LA on his big win-Livestrong)  Y'have it? he asks me. Sorry John, I don't remember.  So I’m sitting here, staring blankly into my computer screen, desperately trying to come up with something creative to write about. There’s a lot of pressure in maintaining a blog. Somedays I just don’t have much to say. Like today, my mind is focused on other important matters, such as getting my logs done for my stupid internship coordinator (the evil women she is). By the way, does anyone have any ideas as to what I can say I did on Friday? I don’t think it would be appropriate to write that I updated my blog and google searched my fellow interns.   Is your refrigerator running? Well you better go catch it!  Remember when Jack Johnson wasn’t Jack Johnson, rather just a guest on the G. Love & the Special Sauce album. And his song Rodeo Clowns was the only hit on that album. What ever happened to G. Love? I mean, with a band name like that, he has to be making millions. By the way, Jack Johnson is from California. Santa Barbara to be exact. I applied to UC Santa Barbara. Got in. Not so much at UCLA. They sent me the little envelope. I still have it. It’s in a box in my closet back in San Jose. My little brother got into UCLA, but not UCSD, where my older brother and I went. He thinks he’s the smartest one in the family just because he went to UCLA, but he’s really not that smart. We have an annual challenge match of Trivial Pursuit at Christmas and I’ve beaten him 2 years in a row. It’s because he doesn’t read anything other than Sports Illustrated, so I he always misses the brown question – literature. Haha. GTB-go to bed.  You’re my boy blue!  So if you’re ever in a Bruce Springsteen mood, hop on over to  urlLink www.brucespringsteen.net . It’s a Bruce mecca. You can listen to any of his songs. Perhaps a little Born in the USA, or maybe Glory Days (my person anthem). I’m on Fire is always a good one. Don’t you wish the tight jeans, white t-shirt and bandana look was in. Man, the 80’s rocked!   Speaking of the 80’s, we went to the outlets this weekend and the best thing happened to me. (ok, so this has absolutely nothing to do with the 80’s, I just needed a good segway sentence into my next paragraph) So I’m at the Gap outlet, waiting in line to purchase some shirts, when what do I see??? My favorite Gap Scents-Heaven, Om and Dream. I totally thought they didn’t make them anymore because I haven’t seen them at the regular Gap stores in like, 8 years. The lady at the register proceeded to tell me that they’re discontinued (duh!) but Gap still keeps them at their outlet stores. Happy days. I feel like I’m back in HS again. Or at least I smell like I did when I was in HS.  It's too damn hot for a penguin to be just walkin' around.  Mark your calendars…John and I have set a date. December 18, 2004. Location…Vegas, baby, Vegas. We thought we’d go Brittany style so I’ll be wearing my best pair of hip huggers and a trucker hat (it might even say Johnny on it, just to be cute!). All are welcome to attend. Drinks and cocktails to precede the event. (Who wants to be sober on their wedding day in Vegas?) Invitations to follow. And please remember, we’re still registered at the USOC Sprit Store…not to worry, they’re online for those coming from out of state.   When I’m with my friends I feel home.

      Friday August 6, 2004 Since Dana did such a fantastic job summing up last night in her e-mail, I find it unnecessary for me to do the same. Nice job Dana. Your e-mails always make me laugh. It’s been mentioned several times to me over the past few days that people are going to miss the daily blog entries after we all leave the Springs. Let me reassure all of you, that although they may not be as frequent as they are while I’m interning, I WILL continue to blog. I’m just hoping I will continue to have these random thoughts while back at sea level. The thin air up here has made them flow much easier.  I’m not a perfect person. I never meant to do those things to you.  On my drive to work today, I happened to hear a song that conjured up lots of memories for me. I have a tendency to associate periods my life with songs and this one carries a lot of weight. It’s from my freshmen year of college. My real freshmen year, not my swimming freshmen year, which was actually my 2nd year of school. Anyway, the song I heard this morning was My Heart Will Go One by that crazy French Canadian Celine Dion. It really made me think about how different of a person I am now as compared to back then. Ahhh, 1997. What a great year. (I don’t want to hear any comments from you youngin’s about how you were in elementary school when Titanic came out. Let a girl reminisce) Back then I was just an innocent, non-drinking water polo player, not knowing what I was getting myself into wanting to be a bio major and thinking about going to med school. I lived in A-House, 1st floor of Tenaya Hall in Muir College at UCSD. My roommate was Erin Selim, who was from a very small town (by California standards) in Northern California and I had 7 other suitemates, Sunny, Carmen, Polly, 2 other random girls, Jenn and Megan. Ian lived in C-House, 5th floor and we spent many night playing Nintendo and Duke Nuk’em. Ian had a girlfriend Kara who was still in high school. I didn’t like her. Colin Kelly. Sigh. Sun God – I think I went. Need less to say by the end of the year, those water polo girls had gotten the best of me and I started to enjoy a refreshing beverage now and then. I think I place the most blame on Jenny Irwin who, at the Disco pre-party, went around the room to all the freshmen and made us take shots of vodka from the bottle. That was the beginning of the end. It’s hard to say if my true freshmen year was my favorite year at UCSD. I have so many awesome memories from that year. But then again I have so many awesome memories from all 5 years I was at UCSD. The 5-year plan rules. And they were the best 5 damn years of my life.  Shorty you’re my angel, you’re my darling angel. Closer than my peeps you are to me.  I think that’s why I’m having such a great time this summer. Everything here reminds me of UCSD. Living in dorms, eating in a dinning hall, working out again. And the people definitely remind me of my friends at UCSD. A bit on the nerdy side, but always know how have to have a good time. (Please don’t take offence to the nerd comment. I love nerds being one myself. It’s ok to be a nerd.) I’m really going to miss the Springs and all the interns when we leave. Ok, no goodbyes yet. I still have 3 weeks left. I hate goodbyes.  Turnaround. Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes.  Hate to cut this blog short, but believe it or not I have work to do. Not work work, but rather school work to finish up. Like I would have work-related things to do. Right. These stupid logs are killing me. I’m tempted to just give my internship coordinator my blog website and say, "Look, this is what I really do all day. Enough with the logs." But before I go, I’d like to say a few parting words to Dana and Meredith (btw-nice shake last night). You girls are awesome. I know that the Louisville soccer team and Geneva College (it’s a real school, I swear) are better places because of you. I’m so glad I was able to spend time getting to know both of you and wish you luck in all you do.  She wore a raspberry beret Sandra

      Thursday August 5, 2004 So there I am, minding my own business, hard at work interning, when I get this e-mail. Well of course I read it because it’s from a dear friend and fellow USOC intern. Little did I now what was about to take place. A challenge! Read for yourself…   i don't even know enough songs to do this well, so i give it to you because you are the jedi master of life. just fill in the blanks with appropriate songs. i'll be impressed whenever you finish this, there are a lot. This is a little game i like to call...   The Soundtrack of My Life   I filled in the blanks and thought I would share them with the rest of you because it took me a while to complete. Thank you Dana Rozum for keeping me entertained all afternoon! Editor’s Note: These songs in no way represent my actual life’s soundtrack…that list will come later. Rather, it is just a list of clever song titles which fit well into each category. Enjoy.   The Soundtrack of My Life   Opening   credits : 1979 by Smashing Pumpkins  Waking up : Good Day Sunshine by The Beatles  Average day : Just Another Day In Paradise by Phil Vasser  First date : Cheeseburger in Paradise by Jimmy Buffet  Falling in love : Friday I’m in Love by the Cure  Love scene : I’ll Make Love to You by Boyz II Men  Fight scene : Seeing Red by Unwritten Law  Breaking up : Bye Bye Bye by Nsync  Getting back together : I Will Buy You a New Life by Everclear  Secret love : Better Man by Pearl Jam  Life's okay : Happy Girl by Martina McBride  Mental breakdown : The Will to Live by Ben Harper  Driving : Crash by DMB  Learning a lesson : A Spoonful of Sugar Makes the Medicine Go Down by Julie Andrews  Deep thought : I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor  Flashback : 1983 by John Mayer  Partying : Gin &amp; Juice by Snoop Dogg  Happy dance : Dance Dance Dance by Steve Miller  Regretting : Opps I Did It Again by Britney Spears  Long night alone : Big Empty by Stone Temple Pilots  Death scene : Goodbye Earl by the Dixie Chicks

      Thursday August 5, 2004 Mad props to Dana on her recap of the game, but here’s my take on it...What an awesome game. First and foremost an important lesson was learned from this trip. Why buy a 12 pack when there’s an 18 pack right next to it. It’s always better to have too much than not enough. At the rate we were going, we should have gotten the 30pack. Yikes! With that said, what a great ride up to the game, filled with dancing and singing and just some general good time shenanigans. (A big thank you goes out to Anne for driving.) It WAS a beautiful day. And who would have thought that toilet paper could have multiple uses. TP coozies. Genius. I can’t remember if it was Evan’s or my idea. Either way, we need to get a patent on it because I’m seeing money $igns in our future.  When the workin’ day is done, oh girls, they wanna have fun.  Girls do just wanna have fun, until they have to go to the bathroom soooo bad that they’re walking fast like crazy people to get through the gates of the stadium to find a bathroom. Then it’s not such a fun time. Good thing there wasn’t a line. They really should have bathrooms in the parking lots of baseball stadiums for the people who drive long distances and enjoy refreshing beverages on the long trip. Coors on the ride up. Coors at the game. Coors stadium. Good times. All we needed was a little Coors in our cereal this morning to jump start the day! Or not. Is anyone else dragging today? I’m a wee bit tired. Now I remember why I don’t go out on weekdays. I'm old Gandalf. I know don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. I feel...thin, sort of...stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread. Mmm. Bread. The dinning hall makes the best bread.  I don't want to come back down from this cloud. It’s taken me all this time to find out what I need again.  Rockie dogs. Wow. Beer and a dog never tasted so good. Beeralicious with hot dog goodness. What an awesome game-did I say that already? Sosa hits a homerun (and I have a picture of it, sort of, it’s kinda blurry but I know what it is.) And the Cubs won. And they played Ben Harper at a baseball game. Life is good. Altitude makes everything better.  I’m easy like Sunday morning Sandra  BTW - Sister Sandy is no more. I’m back. I was gone for a bit. Figured out some stuff. Took my break. But now I’m back. The Tour is on (again) and I’m getting my t-shirt. Only 30 more. Totally doable. Never underestimate the power of Sandra’s ability to accomplish a goal that she sets her mind to. And I’m not going to Macomb next weekend anymore because how could I miss the Opening Ceremonies with the best interns in the world? Plus, I hear the flippy cup re-match is on. Let the festivities begin! I’m back.

      Wednesday August 4, 2004  So my computer crashed about a billion times this morning. I was without a computer for about an hour and a half while it was getting fixed. That was pretty much the worst hour and a half of my life. I’ve become so dependent on this Windows ‘98 piece of crap. It’s a love hate relationship. You know how it goes.  If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding. How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?  So yesterday at dinner we had a brainstorming session for one of the interns. He had to come up with a t-shirt idea for his university to give out this fall at sporting events. Being the somewhat random person I am, I felt the need to take on the challenge. He goes to Virginia Tech-the Hokies, which is a turkey for those of you not in the know. My idea was to have a little kid type drawing of a hand turkey, you know, the kind you made every year in elementary school, with the middle finger discreetly outlined differently than the rest and have the slogan "Stuff This" underneath it. Brilliant! I’m a genius. Mensa here I come. We’ll see if the idea flies with the rest of that hokie bunch back in Virginia. My other idea was Turkey Time. Going on the whole Hammer Time idea. Bust out the baggie pants. You can't touch this.  Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks. I don’t care if I never get back.  We’re off to the Cubs/Rockies game tonight. I’m thinking it’s going to be a great time despite being in the nosebleed seats. And literally, we could have a nosebleed because we’re going to be sitting over a mile above sea level. Did you know that the ball goes 9% farther at Coors Field than at a stadium at sea level? I’m excited to visit my second stadium named after an alcoholic beverage. I’ve already been to a stadium named after a bank but lovingly referred to as Robert, two named after some computer related somethings, one that was used in the library by Mrs. Peacock, and the oldest major league ballpark still in use. Even though I lived less than 3 hours away for two years, I still haven’t been to the gum field or the phone field. I want to visit the pet store stadium, after reading everyday in the paper for 3 years all the controversy surrounding the building of it. I think I'm going to quit my job and visit all the stadiums. Or maybe I'll just quit my job. (17 days left!)  You go whistling in the dark, making light of it. And I follow with my heart, laughing all the way.  I got a free t-shirt today. Free stuff rules. If we lived in a communist society, everything would be free. That would be cool- the free stuff, not the communist society. We had a guy on my swim team back in SD (we called him Melvin for some reason even though his name was Brian) who used to call people on the team commies all the time. And he used to call one of the girls Lauren even though her name was really Rachel. He’s in law school now. Figures. He talked too much. We had an interesting bunch on my swim team. Nerd Alert. I can name at least 10 people I swam with that are either in law school, med school or getting their PhD. And that doesn’t include my nerdy non-swimmer friends. Two are at Davis Med, one turned down 3 med school offers, one’s getting his PhD at Stanford, another works in a lab at Berkeley and I went to Western Illinois to get my Masters in PE. Haha. Western Illinois. The premier academic institution. Right!  Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe…I think it’s the altitude.  She’s only happy in the sun. Sister Sandy  Go Cubbies.

      Tuesday August 3, 2004  So today’s entry is dedicated to my favorite Western grad in Elkhart, IN. Good luck on your interview today and congrats on the new car! And the new Willy Wonka movie isn’t going to suck…it’s just going to go where Veruca Salt and all the other bad eggs go: down the garbage chute. Where does it lead to? The furnace…There's gonna be a lot of garbage today.  Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel is just the freight train coming your way…  So I’ve been thinking about this whole "Thoughts On Winning" thing of Mike’s.  As long as you win, that is the only thing that matters. The sweet taste of others losing and you being the victor is priceless. Losers are always mad at the winner that is why they lose all the time and all the time they make excuses and do not take the blame for there actions. As far as people coming up just short, that means they did not train hard enough. A true winner will always win because the second that you let up he will conquer the endeavor.   -Thoughts of Wining by MIKE -   I’d like to now share with you my own thoughts on winning…This year at D2 NCAA’s in Buffalo, after a few refreshing glasses of…water-hydration is key…a fellow UCSD Alumni shared with me some great advice. Basically, she said that whenever she’s doing something hard she repeats to herself "I’m a winner. I’m a National Champion." And she was, so it makes sense. Being the copycat that I am, I took her mantra and dropped the second part, leaving it just as "I’m a winner." I can tell you now, it has helped me though many a tough times since then. For instance, earlier this summer there was a flippy cup challenge between the women and men USOC interns. When the time came and the game was on the line and the pressure was on and I had to step up and take one for the team, I said to myself "I’m a winner. I’m a winner." And sure enough, that "liquid courage" went down and the cup did flip. The power of the mind is incredible. The body can achieve what the mind can believe. I believed in myself and my cup flipping abilities and sure enough, I was successful in my endeavors. I AM a winner. On a side note: I think the end result of the flippy cup challenge was something like 30 bazillion to 1. Girls win. (Ok maybe it was closer to 17-1, but they still lost horribly) Any chance of a rematch before we all start leaving the Springs??? Morals of the story: 1)You’re never to drunk to be a flippy cup champion if you tell yourself you’re a winner. 2) Boys suck at flippy cup. 3) I'm going to miss everyone when we leave the Springs. Tear.  I know that I can't take no more, it ain't no lie. I wanna see you out that door, baby bye bye bye (Bye, Bye)  My other theory on winning comes from our team’s training trip this winter. WIU’s swimming team headed down to Florida for a week this past January and in some conversation with one of my swimmers I said, "It’s only a race if you’re winning." As an old, washed up collegiate athlete, I feel this is totally an appropriate way for me look at life. Kinda that glory days mentality. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still a fierce competitor and hate losing, however I pick my races…and only take part in races I know I’m going to win. Why? Because I’m a winner.  Makes me that much stronger. Makes me work a little bit harder. Makes me that much wiser. Thanks for making me a fighter.  So when did Christina Aguilera become a hoe? Last I remember she was singin’ about some genie in a bottle. Now she’s all crazy. I bet she’s someone’s hoe in a different area code. Speaking of which, at times I do enjoy a good gangsta rap song. I’m a fan of EZ-E (may he rest in peace) and Dr. Dre (I had a friend who used to call me Dr. Dra) and Snoop (before he stop smokin the dope – now he’s kinda a sell out). I mean, come on, who doesn’t love the classic rap lines like, lodi dodi we's likes to party, everywhere I go I fine girl will please me east to west college girls are easy, California…knows how to party, ain’t nothin’ but a G-thang baby. Good times wit da 40’s and my homies. Word.  Now gimme that toot toot and I’ll give you that beep beep.  I’m a winner. Dr. Dra

      Monday August 2, 2004  This blog entry is dedicated to a few people. First and foremost, this goes out to the Pikes Peak crew who braved the early morning start, the hot, the cold and the altitude, but finally made it up the mountain in a little under 7 hours. Adam, Evan, TJ and Kari: Thanks for an awesome morning for hiking. You all are bad asses in my book. Next, I’d like to thank the support crew who "survived the drive" to meet us at the top. That was icing on the mountain climbing cake having you all up there when we finished. Without you, we’d still be hiking down. And who says 575 degrees is too hot for brakes. We should have just kept driving!  After yesterday’s hiking adventure, I feel like I can do anything. I’ve spent some time this morning google searching Mt. Everest. How cool would that be! Come on, how hard could it really be? I mean, the sherpas do all the work anyway. I wouldn’t even have to carry any of my own supplies. Even up Pike Peak I had to carry my own backpack and water. I’m thinking, if I’m going to climb another mountain, it might as well be the mountain of all mountains. Why sell myself short. Nepal, here I come. (Or maybe I’ll just re-read Into Thin Air and get my Everest fix that way. It’s a lot safer. And warmer. And cheaper.)  But really. This whole hiking 14ers has got me thinking…I want to keep going. Realistically, I have no goal of hiking every 14er in Colorado, but one or two more couldn’t hurt. Especially after being told that I get an asterisk next to my Pikes Peak ascent because we didn’t hike down. (This is coming from someone who spent all day hunting and brought back nothing. You got out smarted by some deer, quite possibly the dumbest animal on the planet.Ha.) So my tentative plan is to hit up Torrey and Gray’s Peak this weekend. It won’t be nearly as tough as Pike’s, because round trip it’s only 9 miles and the trailhead starts at over 10,000 feet rather than the 6,500 that Pike’s did. This hiking business is addicting. I better get my fix before I head out to Illinois, where the only mountains I’ll be climbing are… well…there aren’t any mountains in the mid-west. And I can’t even say something clever like, "the mountains of homework I’ll have" because I’m done with school forever. Yahoo for no school and yahoo for me!  So I watched Fight Club over the weekend. Talk about a twisted movie. Holy cow, can you show any more blood? Even when I had my eyes closed, so as not to see the crap getting kicked out of some guy, I could still envision it with the realistic sound effects. And I didn’t get the whole soap thing. I think it’s one of those movies you have a to watch a few times to fully understand. Maybe I’ll just find a site online that explains it all to me and save myself from all the blood and guts and punching sounds again.  There should be a bar at the top of Pike Peak. I'm thinking about opening up one. What a buzz that would be! Imagine a nice, cold, refreshing Coors Light after hiking 12.6 miles. Mmmm, beer. Mmmm, beer when you’re already buzzed from the lack of oxygen at 14,000 ft. And you’d have to drink the beer out of red cups. I'd make a million bucks.  Sandra Brewmaster, Bar Camp Brewing Company (Get it? Bar Camp instead of Barr Camp. Ok, nevermind)  BTW – There is no Mt. Chimichonga volcano anywhere in Alaska. I think whoever said there was, must have been delirious from spending so much time on a boat in the middle of nowhere and desperately craving some mexican food. There is however, a Mt. Chiginagak, which is a stratovolcano and is located on the Alaska Peninsula in the Ugashik quadrangle. Perhaps, this is your Mt. Chimichonga. GTB(go to bed), no wait GEB (go eat a burrito)!Ha.

Details to follow... Sorry for the short entry but there's a bbq goin' on at the Training Center at 11am. That's right, I only have to work for 2.5 hours today! Let the games begin!  Go USA!

      Thursday August 12, 2004 This shouldn’t happen. I actually have to do work in the office. I’m actually not bored. This is the first time in 11 weeks that I have been busy all day. I’m actually doing this blog entry during my "lunch" and sporadically during my free moments. I’m worried that I might have to work through tomorrow’s opening games activities because of this whole Olympic rush we’re having. Our Ex. Dir. is heading out to Athens and there’s a tons of things they are just now realizing that need to get done before he leaves. Great.  I’m never alone. I’m alone all the time. Are you at one? Or do you lie?  Remember when Gavin Rossdale was the hottest thing since sliced bread. Wow. When I was in high school, I loved Bush and Gavin like it was my job. Even into college I was a avid Bush fan. And then he started dating Gwen from No Doubt. It was a sad, sad day for Sandra. I always wanted to have abs like hers. I actually saw No Doubt in concert in 1995 when the only hit they had was "I’m just a girl". An old friend from high school was a total Gwen wannabe before that whole ska/punk phase was cool. We thought she was the biggest freak, dressing ska back in ‘95 Then a few years later, the big band/ska/punk craze hit SoCal and everyone and their mom started to dress like she did. She also dated the trumpet player from Reel Big Fish and spent most of her senior year of high school driving down to OC to see him play. She was the total RBF groupie. It was cool though because my freshman year at UCSD, she got me into the Reel Big Fish/Madness concert in for free. And I’m all about free things.  But you never seem to run out of things to say…this is the story of a girl.  Still talking about my friend from high school. After our sophomore year, we went this camp together on Catalina Island, which is off the coast of SoCal. It’s called Camp Fox and it pretty much was a week’s worth of laying out, playing beach volleyball and hanging out by the ocean. It was awesome. She had been trying to convince me for years to go with her and I finally gave in. Her boyfriend at the time borrowed my UCSD sweatshirt at camp and I didn’t get it back until the end of my senior year of hs. It was awesome because he broke it in for me and to this day it’s my favorite UCSD article of clothing. Oh, did I mention her boyfriends was 25…and yes, we were only jr. in high school. Scandalous.  What would you say if I took those words away? Then you couldn’t make things new, just by sayin’… Sandra

      Wednesday August 11, 2004 Old Chicago’s is a fine drinking establishment. I’m goin’ for the mug. Only 32 more. Enough said.  So why do we choose the boys that are naughty?  There’s a rodeo here in the Springs this weekend and you know what that means, hot guys in tight jeans and cowboy hats, spittin’ all over the place. Dip is pretty much the most disgusting thing ever. Smoking is sexy compared to dip-I’m not condoning the use of cancer sticks, I’m just drawing a parallel. But back to the cowboys. I never saw a real cowboy until I lived in Illinois. In San Diego we had the pseudo-cowboys. You know the type, the city slickers who work in a cubical all day but listen to country music and own a cowboy hat, therefore making them a cowboy despite never having ridden a horse or been on a tractor. My friends and I would go to this country bar called In Cahoots and that’s where the pseudo-cowboys would hang out. On Wednesday nights they would play "regular" music mixed in with the country stuff to entice people to bring non-country fans to dance. Wow, good times. I wish they had a country bar in Macomb. Ok wait, I take that back. A country bar in Macomb would bring in a "dodgy" crowd, kinda like the Finish Line here in the Springs…but that’s another story altogether. How’s the cancer Travis? Yahoo for cowboys.  Someday I'll teach you to beg, someday, someday. Yes I live for the day when I can hear you say, you make me feel like a whore.  Back in 11th grade I loved Everclear. The band not the drink. Besides the drink is illegal in the State of California. At UCSD there’s a concert every year called Sun God. The day is named after the Sun God sculpture on our campus and is one of many pieces in the Stuart Art Collection. ( urlLink http://stuartcollection.ucsd.edu/phalle/4.gif ) Basically it’s a day when all the nerds leave the library and their computers to come out and drink and go to a concert later that night…if you ever make it to the concert. I didn’t make it to the concert my freshmen year. Nerdy drunken debauchery. Good times. One Sun God, my friend Matt and I (same Matt from the last blog entry) drank a whole handle of Captain Morgans on Sun God. Then we went to the concert and played in the bounce houses and the inflatable obstacle courses they have there. We raced. I won. I’m a winner. My last Sun God I had to sneak into because I wasn’t a student anymore. After spending the afternoon saki bombing at Yakimoto’s, we went back to my friend Molly’s house and decided it was necessary to make me a fake schedule to get me into the concert. We took Molly’s real schedule and changed it up a bit. We thought it was genius in our drunken state. Somehow it got me in so that’s all that really matters. All I remember from that night was that someone ripped all the leaves off Molly’s tomato plants and she got very upset. So this is where Everclear comes in. The Sun God after I was a winner at the obstacle course, there was a crazy rumor that Everclear was going to headline Sun God. Need less to say I was excited. Well it ended up that they didn’t and I had a crappy Sun God. Mostly because the bands sucked and I was still bitter that Everclear wasn’t playing. Also because of the above mentioned Matt and I were no longer friends and I went home sober. Booo.  I am still livin' with your ghost. Lonely and dreamin' of the west coast.  When I stay up late, enjoying the company of friends, I tend to indulge in foods that are not exactly what one would call "healthy". In Macomb, the Hardee’s starts serving breakfast at 4am. One evening, or rather, morning, after spending some quality time with two friends at the riverboat (single deck blackjack-I’m a winner) and after a high stakes game of head to head flippy cup between the boys, we decided to head on over to Hardees, for something call a Harold. Time check 3:45am. Those crazy Macombie Homies who work at the Hardee's would not serve us breakfast until exactly 4am. Crazy! That’s ok, we needed to sit down anyway. It had been a long night. After what seemed like an eternity, but really was only 15 minutes, 4am came and we were ready to have our Harolds. Now I don’t know if a Harold is a Macomb specialty or what. There are rumors you can get them up in the Chicago area, but I don’t know. Anyway, a Harold consists of biscuits, two eggs, sausage and hash brown bites all piled into one giant heart clogging stack and smothered in gravy. Sounds gross, I know. But for some reason, at 4am it’s the best thing you’ve ever tasted. For those of you out in California, just for clarification, Hardees is really Carl's Jr. Wacky midwesterners changing the names of our fast food places. Geez. For a glimpse of one of these delicious treats, head on over to room 302, cell block 87. I have pictures. Harold is actually the reason I’m going back to Macomb. Good times.  And you're working your way from the ground on down.  These are my confessions… Sandra  The Beer Olympics are coming...300 Million Beers Strong.  Editor’s Note: I’ll buy a beer for the first person who can name the song and artist of all the lyrics in my blog entries for the past week. Ok, two beers. Two beers and a shot. Two beers, a shot and a picture taken with yours truly to frame and put next to your bed so I can be the first thing you see when you wake up in the morning! Any takers?

      Tuesday August 10, 2004 The Olympic start this weekend and I don’t know if I’m excited or bummed. I’m totally amped to be at the Olympic Training Center during the Olympics, it’s probably the next best place to be after Athens. But at the same time, I’ve never had to work when the Olympics were on. In 2000, I remember vegging in front of the TV with my roommates and watching nearly everything that was on TV. We don’t even have a TV in our office, nor do I have one in my room. I’m going to have to either hang out in the "rotunda" or in the lounge-if those stupid shooters would ever stop taking over OUR lounge. Who do they think they are? Enough with the meetings already. Go workout or something.  Summer, summer, summertime. Time to sit back and unwind.  Do you ever wonder why Will Smith dropped the Fresh Prince nickname? If I were a Fresh Princess I would totally keep that nickname. So would his kids be Fresh Dukes and Dutchesses? And you know Uncle Phil from Fresh Prince of Bel Air…he’s a UCSD graduate. Marshall College. My friend Matt Payne walked in 2000 and I went to his graduation and the speaker was, you guessed it, Uncle Phil. It was awesome, people were chanting "Uncle Phil. Uncle Phil." as he came out. I don’t really remember what he talked about, but it was cool none the less. After graduation, I went to PF Chang’s with Matt’s family. The lettuce wraps there are to die for. Now that I think about it, that’s the last time I've been to PF Chang’s, over 4 years ago. And the last time I talked to Matt was in February of 2001. Good riddance to bad rubbish. Did I say that outloud?  Please don’t wake me, no don’t shake me, leave me where I am, I’m only sleeping. (For Travis)  Red cups are awesome. I’m going to buy stock in Solo, the red cup maker company, because every college student at one point or another buys red cups. Plus they are the "number one plastic cup, plate and bowl producer in the marketplace today". (www.solocup.com) They also have a new product out, "SoloGrips, ergonomically designed, easy to hold cups and plates, so its less likely food and drinks will slip out of hands, which makes for fewer spills" – because everyone hates a party foul! If I were in charge of the red cup division at Solo, I’d make red cups with different schools logos on them, to help with school spirit. I would also make it so you could have customized red cups. How cool would that be to have a whole stack of cups that said "Sandra" or maybe "USOC Team Interns". This idea’s going to make me a million bucks. I love red cups.  You look like gold to me and I'm not too blind to see, you look like gold.  Like a drifter I was born to walk alone. Sandra

      Monday August 9, 2004  What an awesome weekend. And yet sad at the same time. I was able to bag two more 14ers, do the incline and say goodbye to two of my fellow interns all in a matter of 48 hours. I think I’m too tired to figure out whether I’m happy or sad. I need a nap.  If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life, never make a pretty woman your wife. So for my personal point of view, get an ugly girl to marry you.  Last week was the last time all of us USOC summer interns were together. This weekend we lost two. Next weekend we’ll lose a few more. A few more the following weekend. And finally, the weekend of the 27th the majority of the interns will have left the Springs, myself included. It’s kinda sad if you stop and think about it. This has been one of the most awesome summers for me and I know I’ll be sad to leave. Even though my job is crap and I dread going to work everyday, I would do it all over again in a heartbeat if it meant I could meet all the incredibly cool people and experience all I have this summer. When they say this is one of the top internships in the country, they’re right. The USOC gathered up a great group of people for this summer. I’m so glad I got to spend 12+ weeks with people so different and yet somehow the same as myself. Every one of you has made an impact on my life and I will forever remember all of you. Ok, no more good byes. I’m terrible at goodbyes. Plus I’m not going anywhere for a while. I still have 18 days left.  Why do you build me up (build me up) Buttercup, baby, just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around?  On Saturday I was able to hike two of the most incredible mountains, Grays and Torrey’s Peaks. I woke up at 3:30am and was out the door at 3:45am. I wanted to stop in at the dining hall and grab a soda for the drive, but it was locked. Explain to my why a gated and guarded complex (if you call those guys at the front guards) would lock the dining hall. And then, my key wouldn’t even open it up. All I wanted was soda, maybe some coffee. I wasn’t going to rob the place. So I was off, without a soda, and driving up 25 toward Denver. I’m amazed at the great selection of music that played on the radio at 4am. And I only heard Hoobastank played once. Impressive. When I got to my exit off the 70 (little SoCal lingo calling I-70 THE 70) I was excited to see a dirt road. My little jeep was finally going to go off-roading. FUN. If you’ve ever been to Disneyland and gone on the Indiana Jones’ ride, the road was like that. Bumpy, to say the least. There was a point where the road was washed out and I couldn’t go up any further, so I had to hit reverse and go down the mountain, backwards. I was kinda nervous. Just a little. Then I had to flip a bi*ch (another SoCal term meaning U-turn) on the one lane dirt road to get my car pointed to other direction. Yeah, I think I did something like a 30-point turn. But my car was safe (and dirty) and I was ready to hike. Up the mountain, down the saddle, up the other mountain, down the mountain, back to my car. Throw in some goats and a few stops to take pictures and that’s pretty much all I did for 6 hours. For some reason when I passed people hiking up the trail, they asked if there was room for them in my pack. Like 3 different people made that same "joke". It’s really not that funny and no you can fit in my pack. Geez.  Driving down the 101, California here we come, right back where we started from. California!  So I’m listening to the radio on my drive back from Denver and on comes Hotel California. And I start thinking to myself about the next time I'll actually be back in that great home state of mine. And I realize that it won’t be until Thanksgiving or Christmas that "I’ll be back". (Get it, Arnold’s our governor, and in that movie he said I’ll be back. Little joke. Nevermind) After getting a little homesick-ok not really, but I started thinking about all the songs with California in the title. Here’s my list so far…  Side note: I live about 2 miles off the 101. Yerba Buena Exit. But up north it’s just 101 not THE 101. The word THE only precedes freeways in SoCal, not so much NorCal. Example sentences. "I take the 5 to the 405 from SD to see my brother at UCLA." However, you would never say "I take the 280 to get to SF from SJ." Instead you would just say "I take 280 to get to SF." Now you know. And knowing is half to battle. GI Joe.  California Dreamin’ by the Mamas and the Papas California by Tu-Pac Hotel California by the Eagles Californication by RHCP (close enough) California Girls by the Beach Boys Goin’ to California by Led Zeppelin California by Phantom Planet (the theme to the OC) Do You Know the Way to San Jose? By Dionne Warwick  Ok, so that last one doesn’t have California in the title, but it has San Jose and that’s my hometown. How many of you have a song about your hometown?? None! Except maybe Jenise, but that’s only because she’s from El Paso and I think it’s some law for every country singer to sing at least one song about Texas or El Paso. Anyway, Dionne also sang (the original version) of that song in My Best Friend’s Wedding, you know the one, "forever forever you’ll stay in my heart…only be heartbreak for me!" BTW that movie is the story of my life-so I felt I had to include Dionne's song on my list.  Now you don’t need money with a face like that do ya honey?  Ok, well my supervisor is actually in the office today so I feel like I should at least be pretending to do something. Plus I have these stupid journal entries for school to finish up. Check ya later.  If you don't like my fire, then don't come around… Sandra

      Wednesday August 18, 2004  This is why T-Dawg is the best ex-apartmentmate ever.  Just remember: you are Sandar Lopez, ruler of the universe, and you don't need to take any of his crap whether he is delivering it directly or indirectly. You are going to have a great year in Macomb regardless of what happens…Be strong, you are too good of a person to have to deal with that. P.S. Of course! I check out the blog everyday!     Winter’s cold, spring erases and the calm away by the storm is chasing. Everything good needs replacing.  But on to more exciting things…cover bands rule. Where else can you hear Oasis, followed by Nirvana, followed by Steve Miller Band? And after putting back a few (even if they were Millers-yuck) it’s like karaoke night at the tavern. But the awesome part is that no one can hear you because the band’s too loud. Almost as fun as e-mail karaoke, but not quite.  You put the happy in my ness. You put the good times into my fun.  Last night was a lot fun. Our days together as an intern bunch are dwindling so we’re making every night count. However, I don’t remember how I ended up consuming that much beer. I think it’s the straw. Those damn straws always do me in. Amazingly, I felt great this morning. A wee bit tired, but good ol' Nalgene saved me again. Three words…hydration, hydration, hydration! Tonight we’ll have to get Kevin out. He’s been MIA lately with his absence at the Beer Olympics and last night at Tony’s. I’m scared to see what’s going to happen tonight, seeing as it’s Anne’s last night and Evan and Mike leave Friday. Bar fight? Wrestling in the hallway? Drunken interns stumbling in at an ungodly hour? Sleepover in the lounge? All of the above? I’ll let you know tomorrow. But one thing's for sure, it’s going to be a fun night with lots of stories in the morning.  Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner, I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner. I play my music in the sun.  You know when you’ve done a whole bunch of abs and then you sneeze…man that hurts. You know what else hurts? When fad words die out. Take for instance, the word fresh. Remember back in the day, everyone called everything fresh. "That’s so fresh. I’m so fresh. You’re so fresh." I’ve decided to bring the word back. It’s going to be fresh.  Oh no, not me I never lost control. You're face to face with… Sandar...ruler of the universe  Side Note: Check out google’s website. Everyday they change the little picture at the top and they all have an Olympic theme. They’re so clever those Silicon Valleyans. Plus today’s their IPO. IPO’s are kinda like a company having a birthday. I think we should celebrate…happy birthday google.

          Tuesday August 17, 2004  It appears as though this quarter life crisis thing is contagious. Too many of my friends are going through tough times. T-Dawg hang in there. I know what it’s like to have a sucky job. It will make you appreciate everything that’s awesome in your life. And Rhonda, just remember that no matter what happens, you can always come hang out with me in Macomb. Keep your heads up and remember to smile.   I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I've got to do or who I'm supposed to be. I don't want to be anything other than me.  Dude. A girl I swam with is getting married. Weird. Only because it’s Lindsey. Weird. And don’t worry Tia, I’ll be sure to get your approval on my fiancé(e). You have mine with Eric…did I say that outloud? Just call me Mrs. Mayer.  It's a nice day to start again. It's a nice day for a white wedding.  There’s been some talk as to which team was the true winner of the Beer Olympics. Mrs. North Carolina-is-the-best-school-Go-Tar-Heels seems to think her Big Gulps somehow beat the Red Rooters. I beg to differ. Just because you make a cool intern video doesn’t give you the right to decide who won the Beer Olympics. Plus, I don’t remember a second boat race. Therefore, it didn’t happen. And which team had two longest keg stands? That’s right. The Red Rooters. Also, I’ll have to check your facts about the four people vs. two in finishing off the keg. That might also fit under the "Sandra doesn’t remember it so it didn’t happen" clause. Happy last day of work Anne.  We’ll raise up our glasses against evil forces, singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses.  UCSD = U Can Study Drunk…very clever that brother of mine. I haven’t heard that one before. And I’d like to meet this Mat Lopez fellow. I think I can beat him at Trial Pursuit. Perhaps we should make it interesting and have it be a drinking Trivial Pursuit contest. And yes, that is a challenge.  And playing those games as I wait for your call. And now I give up, so goodbye and so long.  Boys stink. I promise to follow the rules from now on Ian. What are the rules again?  RRR (Red Rooters Rule) Sandra  Isn't there more to life than being really really really really really really good looking?

      Monday August 16, 2004  Having plenty of free time today at work with my boss out of the office, I decided to continue on with another blog entry for today. Also because I didn’t expand much on the leaving of interns this weekend. It’s sad not having a roommate anymore. This morning, when I walked into my room after my shower, I totally expected to see Jessi blowdrying her hair. But she wasn’t. She’s back in Oklahoma, getting ready to head over to Athens. I don’t like having half of room 302 empty. I’ve only ever had 2 real roommates, Erin my college roommate and Jessi here at the Springs. Both girls are awesome people and I don’t think I could ever live in the same room with anyone except these two. Don’t get me wrong, I love having the room to myself, but I’m also sad that everyone is slowly leaving the Springs.  And if the night runs over. And if the day won’t last. And if our way should falter along the stony pass. It’s just a moment. This time will pass.  And then yesterday Kari left. And she cried. Monumental! It seems like everyone is getting ready to leave. Anne’s leaving Thursday. Mike and Evan are taking off Friday and Adam next Tuesday. I only have one more weekend here. Wow. I’m really not ready to leave yet. It makes me sad when I have to delete people from my intern e-mail address book because they’re no longer interns. I say we have intern reunion in Vegas around Christmas time. Check your schedules and get back to me!  Viva Las Vegas Side Note: Did you know that it was 27 years ago today Elvis died?  So I’m going to make it a policy that if you leave me a comment on my blog website, I’ll write about you. My friend Gunter from SD left me a comment this weekend so I’m going to spend a whole paragraph talking about him. Ahh Gunny. He was just a young tike when I first met him, a little freshmen my senior year of swimming. He was scared of me for most of the beginning of the season because of the "listen up you freshmen bi*ches" speech I gave the first day of swim practice. (I wasn’t about to pick up kickboards and pullbouys my senior year so I had to make it clear to the freshies that it was their job.) Good times my senior year of swimming! I got written up twice that year, because of oncampus drinking but never had any repercussions because I didn’t live on campus and was over 21. We had a party one time at Christine's apartment and the OPS came. We had people actually jump out of her 2nd story window to avoid getting written up. And Dan song acted as Christine’s legal counsel. Then over Christmas, again at Christine’s apartment, I drank the bottle of Electric Reindeer wine that Molly had given me for Christmas. The next morning I had to drive 7 hours back to SJ. I don’t remember driving home. I took a nap at a Jack in the Box parking lot at some point along the 5. Good Times! Gunter, you’re bad news. Everytime we hang out, it’s always trouble. Maybe that’s why my senior year was so much fun!  O’Doyle Rules Sandra

      Monday August 16, 2004 I’m probably not the best person to be giving the summary of Friday night’s Beer Olympics but I will definitely do my best in trying to remember what happened. So it started off with a fantastic day at work, only because I was done by 11am. I vote for every Friday to be Opening Ceremonies Day at the Training Center. After the lighting of the torch, some of us got a special sneak peek of Anne’s Intern Video, which I have to say is pretty much the coolest thing ever! Throw in some t-shirt making, a nap, the purchasing of a keg and saying goodbye to my roomie, Jessi, and then the festivities began.  Aztec, long necks, paychecks spent. It’s a b double-E double-R-U-N?  The start of the Beer Olympics coincided with the start of the Opening Ceremonies and teams were decided earlier that day at lunch. Wearing the red shirts and aptly named the Red Rooters were Old Man (Evan), Starky (Kari), Baller (Chris), Sister Sandy (yours truly) and the late arrival, Uncle Trav (Travis). The blue team, also known as the Big Gulps, consisted of Sparky (Anne), Madam (Adam), Trav’s Brother (Kurt), Intern Wannabe (TJ) and Gassy (Becki). Officiating the evening’s games were Dave (thanks again for hosting the event as well!), Beth, and Jenise (Thanks again for getting our drunk as**es home!) Spectators included Annie and Dave’s brother, Lee.  If you're drinkin' well, you know that you're my friend and I say, I think I'll have myself a beer.  And then the drinking started. And we didn’t stop until the keg was done. That’s right. We finished the keg. Go us. We started by playing the high/low game with the number of Olympians of random countries. Also, if you didn’t know where a country was, you had to drink. Did I mention how much I suck at geography. Keg stands were performed by all team members, multiple times by some. Evidently Evan’s mom is a slut. Or at least that’s what he told us. Chris was in a giving mood. Hugs all around. There were shouts of "Show us your hernia" throughout the night. A waterfall of gigantic magnitude took place and I have no idea who won. There was some confusion as to where the bathroom was located in the apartment, but I think he finally figured it out…or not. As stated via e-mail by Mr. Volleyball…  "I got them squared away and then (Kari &amp; TJ) I went to bed. But about 5:00am, I hear my door swing open. I look up and tj is walking into my room and mumbling something. He walks over to the cornerwhere my laundry basket is and zips down his pants like he is going to take a piss. I jump out of bed, pull him back, yank his shorts up and lead him to the bathroom to piss. Yeah, that would have been pretty bad if he pissed all over my clothes. That was a close one."  Speaking of improper urinations…we still are unsure as to how Evan’s boxers, socks, passport, tickets, ects got soaking wet. Urine? Water? Beer? We’ll never know. Good thing for free laundry.  No time for losers ’cause we are the champions.  Although no official tally was kept, in my opinion, the Red Rooters won. But then again what do I know, I was hunched over on the side of the house, "and then, then I made a noise like this. Huagh. Huagh. Huagh. Huaaah! And, and then I dumped it over the side on all the people in the audience. Then, th-then then this was horrible, all the people started getting sick, and throwing up all over each other. I never felt so bad in my entire life."  Good times! I’m going to miss you guys!  Got the t-shirt. Moving on to the mug. 25 more. I can do it. I’m a winner. Sandra
