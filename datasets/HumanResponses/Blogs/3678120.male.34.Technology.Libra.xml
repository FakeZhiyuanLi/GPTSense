      The following was written October 1st, 2001, thee weeks after the 9/11 attacks.  I'd like you to read it and remember the anger most of fealt at that time. Perhaps we should continue to feel that anger.  Don't let the Giant fall back asleep!  Our Enemies!  Hello my friends.  You know it's not like me to keep silent about something like the events of September 11th.  Something like this happens, and usually I'm the first to open my big mouth.  However, this time, I've been left speechless.  I've not been able to comprehend the magnitude of what has happened.  So, out of respect for those who've died, I've kept silent, a mourning period so to speak.  But now my friends, my mourning period is over.  Now my friends, I must speak my mind.  What you are about to read, is not for the faint of heart.  It is not for those who believe we should forgive those who would sin against us.  It is not for those who think we need to solve this problem diplomatically.  So if you are one of those people, I do not advise you to read on.    Let me first start by commending the Firemen and Police officers who went into the World Trade Center prior to its collapse.  These men and women made an INFORMED decision to go in.  They were experienced and trained individuals who KNEW the possibility of this building coming down.  And yet, they went in anyway.  They went in, not for glory, but to help.  They did not hesitate, not even for a second.  That is bravery like I've never known.  To knowingly go into a building that is destined to fall, only to help people.  Words cannot express my respect, and gratitude for these people.  They lived and died with honor.  Honor, a word most people don't truly understand.  These people’s lives define honor.  I also want to mention the rescue workers professional and volunteer working even still.  These people are also some of the bravest people I've ever heard of.  They work on and on without the slightest glimmer of hope of finding someone alive in all that hell.  My salute and my thanks to all of you.    That being said, I want to move on to our enemy.  These worthless little bastards are going to pay.  They can't come into our country, learn from our teachers, enjoy our freedoms, and enjoy our way of life, in an effort to take it away.  These cowardly bastards think they can smack us in the mouth and run and hide?  We will search to the end of the earth and beyond if needed.  And when we do find them, I hope we cut their tiny, shriveled from the sun, impotent little testicles off, boil them in pig fat, then force them to eat them, while pouring jet fuel on their extremities and setting them on fire.  Letting them suffer and burn the way so many innocent Americans did.  Of course, we won't do that, because we are Americans, and we believe in Human Rights.  We believe that every human being, no matter how evil, how worthless, how insignificant, has rights.  Rights to be treated with decency.  I realize this is a concept Osama Bin Laden and his crew can't possibly understand.  How could they? Seeing the way they treat their women, the very women who gave them life.   They can't possibly understand what it means to live with Honor.  They can't possibly understand what it means to live with decency.  And before much longer, they won't be able to understand what it means to live, period.  Because we will kill them.  Unfortunately, it will be a quick death.  They won't suffer, as they deserve to.  Lucky for them.  My God how I'd like to find them myself, rip out their black, loveless hearts and watch them die.  Let them taste my rage.    Osama Bin Laden says that we are the infidels, that we are all that is evil.  These ignorant maniacs gave us a lesson on what is truly evil.  They defined evil with their cowardly attacks on innocent men, women and children.  They say they are righteous, that they have God's blessings.  I cannot imagine a God who would condone such an unforgivable act.  They have just picked a fight with the richest, most determined and most powerful nation on the planet.  I hope they realize the true rein of terror they just brought down on themselves.  They have just pissed off over 300 million people.  Once again showing their ignorance.  We will find them, and we will prevail.      Now that the bombing has started, and we are biting back, they are complaining that we are invading them.  We are killing innocent civilians. I believe around 300 or so innocent civilians have died so far in one missile malfunction.  Let me clarify a missile malfunction.  The missile went off course.  An electronic circuit failed, and the missile went off course.  It wasn’t steered into this village.  The controls weren’t hijacked by some radical American then steered into this village.  The missile just malfunctioned.  Now, these things happen in a war.  A war, dare I remind them, they started.  Not us.  We gave them every opportunity to meet our retaliatory demands.  Demands they brought about.  They say we attacked innocent civilians?  The defined what an attack on innocent civilians is on September 11th when they cold-heartedly murdered over 3000 people in an office building.  And what about the attacks on their own people that they’ve committed over the past several years.  I guarantee, in last year, they’ve killed 10 times the innocent civilians we have in that one misfire.  We are a live and let live society.  We never asked for this war.  We never wanted to bomb anyone.  But I will tell you what, you hit us in the mouth, you better be prepared to get hit back.  And to get hit back hard. That’s the price you pay for picking a fight with us.  Don’t think we’re going to make the same mistakes we made in Vietnam.  Don’t think we’re going to do a little here, and a little there.  Don’t think we will send our sons and daughters in without a clear objective.  Don’t think we will let them die in a losing war.  Never again will that price be paid.    Now, let me get to another enemy of our great nation. Certain aspects of this so-called “Political Correctness.”  Oh yes, that is an enemy of ours.  I hear reports of schools taking down signs that read “God Bless America” because it may offend some atheists.  I heard a report that Channel 12 News in Long Island, New York, ordered flags removed from the newsroom and red, white, and blue ribbons removed from the lapels of reporters. Why? Management did not want to appear biased and felt that our nations flag might give the appearance that "they lean one way or another".  I heard a report that the Berkley CA fire department was ordered to remove American Flags from their fire trucks so as not to offend some local residents.  And the topper, in an "act of tolerance" the head of the public library at Florida Gulf Coast University ordered all "Proud to be an American" signs removed so as to not offend international students.  Have we lost our freaking minds?  Have we gone completely over the edge?    We don’t want to offend atheists?  How do you offend an atheist? An atheist doesn’t believe in a higher power.  So, does it really offend them that I do?  Perhaps we’re not the ones being intolerant.  I’ll tell you what, Atheism offends me, and so no one should be allowed to be an atheist.  Does that make any since to you?  Hello?  Anybody home?  What planet are these people from?  We can’t offend the atheists?  Since when?  Tolerance is a two-way street.  If we have to tolerate them, then they have to tolerate us, it’s only fair.    Let me understand something.  We don’t want New York reporters to appear biased?  Who are they going to appear biased to, other New Yorkers?  Give me a break. It is a local television station.  They are reporting the news to Long Island New York.  Perhaps this news organization has become a little too self-involved.  To the Channel 12 management team, I say get a grip, you bunch of losers!    Let me get to the removal of the flag from the fire trucks in Berkley.  Don’t fly the symbol of your country while in your country? Because it may offend some other people who also live in that country?  Is that what I’m to understand?  I’m going to tell you right now, if the American Flag offends you, leave.  It’s that simple.  If you don’t want to see the American Flag, probably not a good idea to live in AMERICA!  You are more than welcome to stay.  But part of the price of admission is tolerance of our flag.  Perhaps that is just too complicated for some people.  Though I can’t imagine how those people have the intelligence to survive in this country.  If you can’t understand that, how do you function in any society?  I lived in Japan for 2 years of my life.  Did I get offended at the sight of the Rising Sun of Japan?  No I did not.  That is the symbol of their country.  Why shouldn’t they fly it proudly?    Now, to the topper:  The head of the public library at Florida Gulf Coast University ordered the removal of signs that read “Proud to be and American” so as not to offend the international students.  The international students are guests in this country.  They are welcome hear to enjoy our freedoms, take advantage of our education system, and create a better lives for themselves.  Common decency demands that they tolerate us.  They’re in our house.  I would never consider going to someone else’s home and criticizing their decorating.  Regardless of what they had hanging on their walls, I would keep my mouth shut, because I am a guest!  I don’t have to be there.  They aren’t holding a gun to my head tell me to “sit here and stare at this ugly wallpaper.”   If I don’t like the environment I’m in, I leave it.  It’s not rocket science.  It’s not quantum physics.  It’s plain old common sense.  When I was in Japan, did I protest their laws and their treatment of women?  No I did not.  Nor did I taunt them with the fact we destroyed them in World War II.   I did neither of these things for one reason, because I was a guest in their country.    How is this so-called “Political Correctness” an enemy of ours?  For one, it’s censorship.  I can’t imagine, in this country, any elected body not allowing the flight of the American Flag.  I can’t even conceive of it.  The Supreme Court of the United States allowed the KKK to adopt a stretch of highway in Missouri, posting signs that say “This stretch of Highway as been adopted by the Ku Klux Klan.”  But students can’t place signs that say “Proud to be an American” on their campus?  Does that make since to you?  That’s clear censorship.  Something the Educational Left proclaims to be so hard against.  It is censorship under the guise of good intentions.  A second reason this “Political Correctness” is an enemy:  It is somebody else telling me how to think, how to talk, and how to be.  You had better think again.  Not as long as there is blood in my veins and air in my lungs will anyone tell me how to think, talk or be.  Political Correctness has become so rampant in this country that it has an entire society so worried about offending somebody else, that nobody can say what they feel or in many cases, speak the truth.  And I see that as a clear and present danger to this country because it goes directly against what this country stands for.  They’ve gotten in through the back door as far as I’m concerned.  The tyrannical regime that defines these rules of political correctness has not done so through legislation, but through pushy and snide comments and this attitude of being superior.  There is just this large manifestation of their beliefs out there, and we being a kind and decent society have started to buy into it.  We want to be good to people.  We don’t want to offend anyone.  But this is getting out of control.  It’s turning us into sheep.  For when we start to compromise our pride, and start to feel ashamed of our flag for fear it may offend a visitor, we’ve started to lose something that is a magnificent gift.  That magnificent gift is Freedom.  Beware my friends; don’t be tricked by their “good” intentions.  Think for yourselves.  That is freedom.      Now, to my fellow Americans:  Perhaps I’ve gone overboard with linking the terrorist attacks with Political Correctness.  But I’ve done it to make a point.  The point is, united we stand.  Every time an American Flag is taken down, that is a small victory for the bad guys.  Every time we compromise our pride, the bad guys win a small battle.  Every time we give up our Freedom, the terrorists get what they want.  As a former United States Marine, I truly believe the best defense is an over powering offense.  I believe the best way to secure Peace is to prepare for War.  That’s right, Peace, through superior firepower.  We don’t want to be the bully on the block, but we do want to be able to whip the bully’s ass.  And united, as one country, as one nation, we will.    Now, I ask that each and every one of you pray for our country.  Pray for our leaders, military and political.  Pray to give them the courage they will need to see this through.  We cannot stop with a missile attack here, and a missile attack there.  This enemy is not a new enemy, but a dedicated one.  We've fought terrorism for years, but with the objective of punishing it.  We must now fight terrorism with the objective of eliminating it.  We must make it a goal for each and every country on this planet to combat terrorism at the heart.  I think as the World leader, it is our responsibility to lead the way.  To accomplish this goal, we must be patient.  We must be dedicated to the end result.  We must elect officials who will continue to fight this fight.  We may get weary.  We may get tired.  We may get fed up with our sons and daughters dieing in this war.  However, as tired as we get, we must stay the course.  We must see it through to the only acceptable end.  And the way I see it, the only acceptable end, is Victory.    God Bless America  Cary M. Gossett  Former, United States Marine
