        Okay where did i leave off...oh me falling and Sarah laughing her ass off, okay well after that we finally got hold of our selves and started walking again, Sarah found a stop sign which is now her strip pole stop sign, kept walking people probably thought we were drunk walking shaking are heads up and down screaming up thats us! lol Well I guess according to da maj it was (late) and since my brother decided to drive right past me it took me even longer to walk home alone since Sarah had to walk the rest of her way home also, well got home, got in shit well not really i kinda made it worse by yelling back but thats okay i was happy and hyper...until then. So yea i went on the computar for a bit...no one was on really, so i went to bed. Yup that was my amazing night lol wandering the streets is my kinda fun! Well then onto today! I've pretty much done nothing, I fought with my bro's for a while, stupid idiots someone take them away before i kill them! Sheesh, well then i decided i would leave them be and go outside to tan, was outside for about 2 hours, I sure am gettin black! sweetness, but now it looks like it just might rain like it was suppose to. Da maj just called, got some bad news, My aunt is suppose to have the baby anytime now went in for her check up thingy today, ends up with drastically high blood pressure, has to go back in 2 hours to check blood pressure again, if its still haigh she has to go into the hospital for emergency ceasection or however u spell it. She's not too happy, she wanted to have the baby at home...its these damn boys, its her third, hopefully the forth will be the lucky girl. Oh and lucky me i have to work tonight so i have to go 5 hours with no news about this new baby benjamin [thats what there naming it] Jacob, Issac and Benjamin isn't that cute!:)      My own written quotes for the day:      **I want this so bad, I can't give up on it**   **Do I give up now before I hurt even more**   **My heart is locked up and only you have the key. Help me find a way to open it and let it free**

        Well i guess i did decdie to return, Sarah had a kick outta my first blog lmao so i will write another! I just woke up from one long and funny night. Me and Sarah decided to head to the park, well not exactly the park, we went to Macs then to the park, then decided to sit in the middle of the street until we felt like walkign again...the first highlight of the night would be me waving to a car and the young uy in the car stopping and looking as thoi he was gunna turn around which made me have a heart attack and then me and Sarah ran. Well, me and Sarah kept walking i itnhk then we headed to Snack Express? Sarah wanted gum i tihnk she got gum or maybe she got sumtin else. WEll then we sat outside Snack Express like the losers sitting outside Tims lol then We started walkign again got hit by a few cars ahahah, met up with some smokers YAY FOR CANCER! [Wait I remember now...Sarah got Ice Cream! lmao] Heard some ppl in there pool but got too chicken to throw the ice cream over the fence then went and Sarah Yelled Nice Body a few times to the hotties in the pool, then i tripped went flying Sarah laughed so hard she fell too and yea i gotta go i'll write more later!!

        Hey! I just started this, i don't no why its another question added to the unanswered, watch me not blog here very much...even tho i wont have much else to do since Niki left me for like all of August and Lauren does camp EVERY day lol. And Then theres Sam, who got pissed at me this morning I don't exactly understand why but lets hope it all blows over! I have more friends than that lol but its summer and people go away and you don't really keep in touch with the people you do during school. Well shall we hear about my boring day...i guess so since thats what this page is suppose to be for isn't it? Well Got up around 10:30 Yay! lol and went and fed neighbours cat and fish and watered there plants like i've been doing since Friday...my first time house sitting how exciting lol, then i pretty much sat around, finished reading my book called One Hot Second (a serious of stories) it was kinda weird but meh i like reading, and while i was reading i listened to my brothers fight outside...did they no they were outside where people could see them try and kill eachother? lol i hate brother,anyways i went on computar for a while no one was on, went outside to tan but the sun disappeared...and as i look out the window at the moment i see that it has returned, decdied to bike down to library got a few more books, went to zhers on the way home to see if my pics were in yet(i'm so excited i have ones from rugby then me and my cuz on it) but of course 3 days isn't long enough for them to develop 2 films for me! lol like i'm the only one who brough in films...if only. And yea that would be my day boring huh? I have a life...not a big one but still one that i do get out! but liek i said its summer and people are on vacation! Oh yea nad thats not all my sis came home from drivers training and had to call zhers, but the guy left 2 different numbers so she decided to yell at ME sheesh but yea she finally got a hold of them they wanted to see if she would like to work there...turns out they work between 3-5 hours a week...what the hell is that?! I work 20 hours a week and at my sis's other job she works 40 hours a week i don't tihnk she needs 5 hours a week, i hate jobs. lol Well that was fun now wasn't it? lol maybe i will return another time and let you no more of my boring life! yay lol
