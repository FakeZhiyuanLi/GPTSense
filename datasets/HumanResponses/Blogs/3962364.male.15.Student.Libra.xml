      Well readers, here is another story that I thought of during the night.  &nbsp; The AMAZING David and his ability is....well sleep talking..  On our third night at camp, Jon has homework and Jarrod and I decide to keep him company. Adam went to sleep at 12am, and David pasted out during his session of trying to stay up. Well its 12:30 and Jarrod starts asking funny questions...what would be the ideal name for a girl....and whos the hotest girl in our class (in the yearbook that is). So me and him start naming people. I said Ashley. David has a big crush on her thats why I said it. So Jarrod, Jon and I continue to talk. It then is 1:30 in the morning, and we are talking when all of a sudden...David rises up with his hand outstreched and a finger and says..blah blah blah blah (that was the jiberish) Ashley?&nbsp; Well, Jarrod, Jon and I are looking stunnned. David sitting there saying ashley after an hour went by without saying it. What the heck? I asked him that. He then just said..i dunno..and pasted out. LMAO!!! Well, that sure was amazing...strange..but funny. LOL David...nice one.  More shall come...tune in

      Well my readers. I have survived my first years at Camp Orlando.&nbsp; And good god...its over. AHH its going to suck going back to my..lonely...stay at home lifestyle...FOR 2 DAYS! Yes, its back to Orlando in two days. UCF soccer camp. But your not reading my blog to read about UCF...its about what happened at Camp Orlando. And by George..I shall tell!  Day-1: Arriving with kaos  With a long drive..and a ..I guess you can say excited...to and eventfull first day. We arrived at the Sheraton and go through the doors and look at the Great Big Lobby. Dont get to excited. Wait till you hear about the rooms! You'll be like..O thats awesome! But anyways. We hear loud music. Jarrod thought it was a club. But we walk through the doors to a big room and loud music. Yearbookers dancing! Who would of thought that yearbook peeps have a wild side? Well Camp Orlando was full of some yearbook hotties! No complaints watching them dance. So with a little bit of dancing, and some rules from the "instructors" we began our classes.  Class- Meet Mrs. Border  Well well well...we have a mixture of spunky and yet...prefectionus (is that a word? get back to me) and a little bit of (some of us think) A.D.D .&nbsp; So class begins. We learned loads..about I lines...fonts...and other stuff. But it gets a little bit boring..and you sometimes need a snooze. NOT like I did that or anything but, thought crossed my mind. So we finish our first lesson. And to top off a boring lesson..HOMEWORK! ugh. But I did finish it. So its all good.  &nbsp; Hotel Room-  Remember what I told you. How you would be like awesome about our hotel room? The famous 1,702 room Shearton. Yes. We stayed at that. But..the downside..we stayed at the 2 story Sheraton. Its next to the big tower. So we walk in to a ordinary hotel room. Two Beds...t.v..refridgerator...basics. But. The door shuts..with difficulty. Bathroom door shuts, not lock, but shuts...with difficulty. But. It will be our home for the next 3 nights. Might as well make it for the best....right? Well obviously I made it through, or else I would not be spilling what happened at camp. So. I have five roomates. Three older staffers, and Jarrod and myself. Jarrod being wild decides to start jumping on the beds. Yes yes, laughs there. But anyway, its our home and thats what matters. After another class, we come back to our "home" and start to chill for the night. With a little bit of laughing and being fat the night ened to Anger Managment and some conversation, we concluded our first night at camp.  Day-2: A beautiful way to start...  Wow...day two..alright. Only 2 more days at camp which really means...damn. I start class and relize that someone other than my fellow TRHS staff members have noticed me. At least, I think I did. Cara was watching and told me about a girl that sits next door at the next table. And she apparently keeps looking at me. First thought is is there something wrong with my feature. Anything in the teeth...on my shirt. But both were a negative. She deffinitly was looking at me.  Well...shes a good looking girl deffintly. So later in class we begin to talk. She is so cool to tlak to, she seemed so chilled. We talked and then I got back to work. I had met a new friend though. And it was pretty cool. Glad I met that girl.  Day-2: THRS and the quest for the holy hat  To make camp more interesting...schools have a chance to do a skit. Schools were supposed to bring a funky hat and do a skit about how that hat defines us. Well, we had to make our hat. And stayed up late making the skit for it. So we decide to make our own version using Monty Python and the quest for the holy grail. Well it was a good one. Im going to try and upload the video onto my blog soon as david can help me and tell me how. Look out for it coming to you my readers.  Day-2: Universal  Later&nbsp;on day two, we get to go out for a little bit of fun. We decided to go to Universal. Most people went to Islands of Adventure, but I do not like roller coasters, so David and Lauren both wanted to go to Universal Studios. No complaints. I went with them. My first time there. We got there and rode The Revenge of the Mummy first. Dang! Thats how you start off a good time. If you havent taken a ride on that..I must say you should. Then ET, Back to the future...MIB2...and other ones. It was a good time.  Day-3: Workshop heats up  Whew..after a fun night, we get back and start to work on layouts. We had to do them on paper!! Im used to doing them on the computer, but paper. So of course. No one from THRS could make a perfect one for Mrs. Perfect herself. So after three pages, I finally have a decent one for the likings of her. We also worked on captioning today. To easy. But that was one easy thing turned into difficulty for me. We get back to the room where Jarrod and Jon both make themselves jump from one bed to another, " FLYING FISH" crazy time. I believe the work was getting to us.  - Later that night was the workout night. Jarrod, David and I go first to the fitness room. Being a soccer player and missing practices..you need to run. So we workied out. Soon Jon, Courtney and Melissa joined us for the fun. We ran somemore and lifted some weights. Well we wanted to go for a swim to cool down, but it was closed. So we needed something to do. Melissa and I went for some ice cream and we went back to the room to watch t.v. Next thing we know there is a security guy at the door. He comes in and says "Im taking care of the room problem..." and tells us to turn the t.v down. Cara is on the phone and he tells her to put it on mute...so she puts it against her chest. But then the room phone goes off and its Lauren wanting to talk to Adam. Overall,&nbsp; we were supposely getting complaints about us, and he came to talk to us. It was the damn Irish people next door. They complained several times supposely. So we made sure we made no noise whats so ever ;)&nbsp;on our last night at the best hotel in the world.   &nbsp; Day-4: Last pages...last of classes  What a bummer, I get to leave Mrs. Borders class..what will I do? Well, first I will not listen to her, and then ill wont do anything! yay! All I did was write letters. Then we went to lil classes and finally met our pro. She talked to us about last years yearbook. Her likes her dislikes, her ideas. Overall she liked our cover and yearbook. So, we checked out, said our last goodbyes to ppl and were on the road to lunch. TGIF. Had some chicken tenders and some final laughs. The ride home was sad. I didnt want this trip to be over..even though all that happened. But we got back to the river and that is where im left now. In two days I leave for UCF soccer. And I can hardly wait to start the laundry for that. Well, I have given you a good five minutes of reading time. Im out for now. Till then readers. Peace.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      What im going to start doing with my blog is kinda make it like a sports site, where you can find out statistics and other information about things going on in the sports world. Some recent things that you might already know are listed below. I might add my input on the situations, depending on what they are. &nbsp; &nbsp; NBA-News &nbsp; -The Big Man gets traded to the Heat.- &nbsp; Shaq is back in Florida. He was traded from the Lakers the the Miami Heat. Wow. Umm that is really bad on LA to do. Give away the heart and sole of the team, well they still have Kobe Bryant...wait...do they? I mean, the lakers lost Shaq and maybe losing another valuable person. Bryant may go to jail for his "Scandal" so LA will be lost of another valuable asset to the team. My thoughts on Shaq leaving LA is that it was a good decision. He is back in Florida with a very good team. Young.. but good. He should of gone back to Orlando..like that would of happend. He could of Joined Steve Francis&nbsp;there were they could of been on the worse team ever. Another team(whom I think he should of went with) should be the Dallas Mavericks. He could of been what Dallas needed after losing Steve Nash to Phoenix. That still could of been the dominant team this upcomign season. But he chose the youngster team. This team, if Shaq decides to stay another year after this upcoming season could be a title shot. They can keep working and they will have a great shot the season after next. It will be an interesting season coming up. Tracey McGrady went to Houston to join Yao Ming and Mobley. Should be another great team there. Well thats all for NBA action. &nbsp; Cycling- Tour de Frace &nbsp; Lance Armstrong is 22 seconds behind the leader.  &nbsp; NCAA- football &nbsp; -FSU opens up season against Miami- &nbsp; Yes, I am an Florida State University fan. And im psyched for this upcoming season. It really sucks to see that my team has to open up against new to the conference Miami. I believe the outcome of this game will determine the flow of the season. FSU is being lead by Chris Rix. :'( But this is his senior year, and hopefully he has gotten better over the off season. FSU should (if they havent already) get rid of Jeff Bowden. I mean cmon! This guy is all about the Running. Have you seen Rix's arm?! Rix needs to be throwing it this season. &nbsp; -Title Contenders?- &nbsp; The team that has been pick by me to go all the way is the University of Georgia. I believe that it will be them because of all the starters they have returning. Wouldnt it be great if it was FSU vs UGA in the championship (held in Miami at the Orange Bowl.) Crap if that happens, I will do a road trip. Im going to that if either Georgia or Florida State is there. It should be interesting. Georgia lost only two games last season. So it should be a good year for them. &nbsp; Golf- Stats- British Open &nbsp; Leader-Hamilton  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Baseball- Scores  &nbsp; NL- Expos and Braves-0-0 in bottom of first &nbsp; That is all for now. Have a good day. I will do a late night blog later tonight. Im off to start packing. &nbsp;

      Well, as you have probably heard from a friend of mines blog, we have a camp coming up in Orlando. It is called "Camp Orlando". It is a "summer workshop" for those who are on there school's yearbook staff. This will be my first year attending this camp, and I really dont know what is about to happen. David, you know him as bagel05, is going all out with his blog. Well if I can figure out how to, I will try to catch "pressious moments" with my video camera and try and put them in my new blog. Dont get your hopes up, because im not sure on how to do it, But if I get something worth it, I guarentee I will try my best to put it on here. Well thats all about "Camp Orlando" for now. I leave at 9 am sharp to go on this wonderful trip. I will be back later with full of posts in my blog. Being that I do need to catch up with my fellow River peeps. So till then, Avri A durchi

      Hail all to all those who are reading this. This is a new blog, so please be patient with the new entries. Also for those of you, it will be kinda slow in the beggining. This is due to the fact I will be going to Orlando for yearbook workshop(you will here more of that in a lil while), and when I get back, two days later I leave for Orlando for the UCF soccer camp. So bare with me, and look around for....er....whatever I have already. Thanks

      Who would have thought that tomorrow school is coming back to us. It seems like just yesturday, I had drivers ed class , and it was about to start. Summer has really been boring and fast. Well being busy this whole past month is a main cause to why its going to fast. I know what my schedule is. Its listed below:  1st period: World History with Mr.Balk 2nd period: Geometry with Mrs. Tidwell 3rd period: Journalism II with Mrs. Felton 4th period: Spanish I with Mrs. Jones  Im happy with some of the teachers I got. It seems like it should be a fairly good 18 weeks. Dang..18 weeks. Geez. Anyway. Yesturday, I had a soccer game in Sun City. I play for an Under 17 competitive team. West Citrus Storm. So, we had our season opener. I played horrible, but we ended up winning 4-3. Stats are shown below:   Player:                    Goals:          Assists:        Team:         Assited By:  Ross Rieland                  1                                         WCS Jonathan Livesay          1                      1                  WCS Eric Swanson                 1                                         WCS          Jonathan Livesay Not sure(find out)         1                                         WCS     Total Shots (WCS)      : Total Shots( Brandon):  West Citrus Storm: 1-0                         Next Week Game vs- at Hernando   Summer has been a blast and a bust. This upcoming school year should be a good one

      Well..it was a tough week, but I survived. Ive been attending this soccer camp for the past 4 years (5 now) now. And every year, I get a better workout than the previous year. Day two..sore. Thats telling you something. I had a great time this year though. Teamates of mine that came for the field player part of the camp had a sometimes dick (on the field) and sometimes cool (off the field). Turns out though, he did everyones evaluation the same way. Word for word, number for number. So the coaches were not happy about that. But im exhausted so im going to go. Later all
