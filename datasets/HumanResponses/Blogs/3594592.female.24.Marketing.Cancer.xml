      hai.. life is miserable w/o hp.. it feels more miserable if you haf a hp but cant call out or sms out.. ah!!! nvm... it's a result of my actions.. i haf to bear the consequence! yesterday's weather was terrible... made me feel feverish, now i'm having a running nose.. dun wanna get Upper Respiratory Track Infection again... it feels sick! Last nite work out was quite tiring but fun.. it's coz of the PT lah.. always suan and make fun of me.. haha.. interesting Xiao Di Di.. his look reminds me of Catherine's bf - Ryan.. but PT is taller and fitter.. alrite.. shan't talk so much about him.. or else he will feel proud..

      wow... my 1st blog after many donkey months.. used to have one blog, but long time never use, already forgotten the username and pw le..   last week, went to cali gym on tue and thur.. interesting, but tiring and expensive.. can really feel the pain when giving the money to the cashier... almost given $600+ to the gym... duno shld i feel regret or happy? makes me broke but strong... aiyo... wat toking me?? makes no sense.. since already paid the money, watz the point of dwelling in the "pain".. work hard to keep fit lor..   hmm.. last sat went for Singapore Idol.. queued up at 330am... gurmit singh interviewed me at 415am... rained at 5am+.. re-queued at 6am.. was soaked from head to toe.. cold and hungry and tired... dun tink would want to haf a second try again.. it's mentally, physically, vocally, emotionally draining! esp i din get in to 2nd round... it's funny! i'm dun feel disappointed at all.. izit coz i'm numb to it ord? or m i juz too tired to tink? i guess i juz went for the sake of fun, datz y not pinning any hopes on myself.. it's good lah, no hope no hurt... haha...   What happened to me? why do i sound so negative and pessimistic?? haiz... Pst Kong is right, richer ppl always feels happier than poorer ppl... I MUST BUCK UP AND EARN MORE MONEY!! not for the sake of myself, but for my family, my future, those who need help.. so dat i can haf money to help them out..  kk.. should stop here and do my work le..
