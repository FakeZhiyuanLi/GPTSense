Selected, JW elders receive special,(  esoteric  ) indoctrination just to try to make sense of it.          Remember,always do that,  'regression analysis' .Just where the heck did it all come from ?   ........Well,Watchtower Leader 'detox' Joe Rutherford,got a 'burr' on his butt,back in the 1940's about blood. They knew it was bogus back then .         It's an overextension of the old testament kosher law,which DOESN'T apply to New testament Christians..           They thought that the end of the world was a coming back then,(1940ish).Sooo, there wouldn't be much of a body count causality.           Now with Blood on their hands,and the murder of thousands of innocent minor children,how can they account for the body count, if they repeal it outright now?          More importantly,  to them ,the WT$ would be sued,for mega-bucks,for all the wrongful death lawsuits.          So,as you can see before your very own eyes,they are eroding away gradually the dogma,eventually the day will come,when " new light " will " flash up " from Jehovah.and it will be dissolved.                   What about all the dead kids,who died for NOTHING?          By the way the chief symptom of my own 28 year horror show with Bleeding ulcerative colitis was, profuse bloody bowel movements on the order of 20-30 x's a day.It created enormous stress for me to know I could bleed to death at any moment.Yet,as a devout Jehovah's Witness be forbidden to have a blood transfusion!

						       Blowing the Whistle on the Watchtower re: sales tax fraud             The following letter was mailed out in quantity to the 50 states (Sales Tax Fraud Divisions) in early 1997.         The collecting of sales tax by peddlers from customers is required in 49 of the 50 states [except,N.H.]       For a full report on the fraudulent nature of the Watchtower in this regard, read:  The Watchtower Way of Laundering Money @ my home page.                Earlier the Watchtower organization suffered a defeat along with Jimmy Swaggart. The previously-mentioned article says,  "Just one month before the new policy was announced, the Society watched how the Supreme Court ruled in California Board of Equalization vs. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.       California wanted to assess sales taxes on the sale of books and tapes and other items by Swaggart's ministry.  The Watch Tower Society filed amicus curiae  (a friend of the court legal brief)  in support of Swaggart's position,  that a religious organization should be exempt from such taxation.         On Jan. 17, 1990, just a little over a month before the Society's change in policy, the Supreme Court ruled against Swaggart and permitted taxation. The Society's new policy avoided any liability for taxation by taking the financial transaction out of the picture (donations cannot be taxed)."       While the Watchtower's "new policy" shielded them from a lawsuit by the State of California (and subsequent others) , they continued to peddle the magazines and books from door-to-door (and to this day), mentioning contributions and although not saying a specific amount to the householder to give, the Witness peddler himself has to come up with the "value amount" of the literature and give it back to the Kingdom Hall to send to Brooklyn. If not enough funds come in according to their evaluation of the "value" of the literature, the Watchtower's literature supply desk will halt the flow of all literature to the local Kingdom Hall until the "bill" has been paid.                 This is still currently the hypocritical practice as of March 2003 .  I also included in the mailings a copy of David Reed's book Blood On the Altar. Some states wrote back; their reply was basically "Thank you," or that they will process the request of the Watchtower's abuse.  Here is a facsimile of the letter I write in 1997:      Danny Haszard P. O. Box 15449 Boston, MA 02215     ATTN:  Certified Mail to Criminal Investigation Tax Fraud Division To all 50 states and all I.R.S. Offices  January 15, 1997  Dear Tax Office,       I am writing to   blow the whistle   on an organization I used to belong to, an organization that is selling millions of dollars of merchandise in this state without collecting sales tax. The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York ships truckloads of books, videos, tapes and assorted other merchandise to their Kingdom Halls across the state. The members take these items from there and sell them house-to-house, returning the money collected to the Kingdom Hall, so that it can be mailed back to Brooklyn headquarters each month. They talk about "donations" but this is a thinly veiled tax-dodging sales operation. Dunn & Bradstreet reports for recent years show their sales in the $1 billion range, so the Jehovah's Witness are certainly selling $--millions in this state.  The religious publishing operations and bookstores connected with other churches are collecting and paying sales tax.  As a taxpayer, I am writing to blow the whistle and to ask what is going to be done about the Watchtower's tax evasion.   Yours truly,      Danny Haszard Bangor Maine USA ( presently )          » Theologically,Jehovah's Witnesses  are a cult of Christianity.The oppressive organization does not represent historical, Biblical Christianity in any way.

						      LOVE BOMBING      HOW DO CULTS SEDUCE THEIR PREY ?    "" ......A tactic used most often is the "LOVE BOMBING"...They swarm over you in a sort of ," Cult   COCOONMENT  ".   All of a sudden,,you have,,INSTANT FAMILY,,INSTANT PURPOSE,,INSTANT COMMUNITY,,INSTANT FRIENDS..... And you don't have to look inside yourself  for answers anymore,,.. because cult leaders, or their designated high disciples,,dispense all your spiritual needs.   A mass delusion,,mass hysteria,,operating under the illusion of a master plan.      In military jargon this is known as ,"Cluster F**k".     Beware of Love Bombing:      Leonard Brenner Love-bombing is characteristic of most cults. Prospects, recruits and members are drowned in a sea of love and caring. Recently in an evangelical church I heard the pastor describe his visit to two cultic groups in which he praised their love-bombing and urged that his church adopt the same loving attitude towards visitors and members.         Should the evangelical church practice love-bombing? Is this what Christ meant when he said, "By this will all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another," (John 13:35)?       I've heard cult members say, "Of course we practice love-bombing: Who'd want to be in a group or church that practiced hate-bombing?"       This attitude highlights a common misconception.  >>>Hate-bombing is not the opposite of love-bombing.       The opposite of love-bombing is unconditional love. Love-bombing is highly conditional. The cults will love you to death while you represent a prospective convert to their group.          As a member a tight family love will surround you as you faithfully promote their cause. However, when it is clear that a prospect will not join the group or a member voices doubts, create waves, or leaves the group, all love ceases.        Indeed scorn is immediately heaped on these individuals and remaining members are told not to have any contact with them. All time, effort and love-bombing is then directed towards new prospects and the faithful members. Is this the love evangelical churches should practice?  Unconditional love  is what God practiced when he sent his Son to die for us?

						   OF INTEREST TO: LAW ENFORCEMENT:    DIFFERENTIAL COMPARISON,OF APOCALYPTIC CULTS vs. COMMON CRIMINALS:       Credo of common criminals;.." there is no honor among thieves","every man for himself"   Credo of apocalyptic cults .."death before dishonor" , "all for one, and one for all ".    A  BIG  DIFFERENCE!   Common street thugs will betray one another at the drop of a hat..This is pretty much a foregone conclusion.   The,imminent 'end of the world' , apocalyptic concept creed , is much more formidable.     This was the lesson learned with the David Koresh disciples at the Waco Texas disaster..These fanatics are pre-programed for martyrdom..The more force that you apply against them, the more it feeds into their self destructive mindset..   This phenomenon has been called,"  suicide by cop".     They think if you kill them, they are going to a [BETTER} place !   This delusion is the underlying doctrine of global terrorism..   Question ? ? The 9/11 suicide perpetrators,, where they sincere ????   YOU BET !!   We have a saying about them,.."they are sincere , but they are sincerely WRONG".      They are not in an eternal paradise of bliss,being waited on by a dozen virgins....They are just dead..     What about the convictions of the Jehovah's Witness cult , and their apocalyptic infatuation ?   My personal experience is some are sincerely devout regarding their convictions of faith.     I know I was.       And, many are driven by the age old credo,of the  trifecta of 3 p's  :Power , Prestige , and Pu$$y....same as the street thugs.More carnal than spiritual.   Is their an effective tactic against entrenched fanaticism ?   Simple....       The tried and tested divide and conquer technique.No matter how much cult leaders would have it otherwise, cult disciples can be split and fractioned.It's possible to dissolve their suicidal resolve.      Appeal to the failed fallibility of their headstrong leaders,and their failed promises,e.g.   "...the emperor has no clothes..."    Appeal to reason and ration.   This may draw some moderate members out , especially if they have small children..   They,don't all want to die.They, are not all ready and eager to be  glorified.    But,if they are belligerent , [about going to paradise] ..You pretty much have no recourse except to ,  "punch their ticket for them ".

						     And another.... and another.... and another....      "Throughout history countless thousands of people have predicted the end of the world, and they all have one thing in common... they were all wrong"                  http://www.sullivan-county.com/nf0/y2k/bible_ca.htm     Date setters, making irresponsible predictions!  Misleading the ignorant masses for higher TV ratings and book sales!    1843-1844   GROUND ZERO: William Miller was the founder of an end-times movement that was so prominent it received its own name-- Millerism. From his studies of the Bible, Miller determined that the second coming would happen sometime between 1843-1844. A spectacular meteor shower in 1833 gave the movement a good push forward. The build up of anticipation continued until March 21, 1844, when Miller's one year time table ran out. Some followers set another date of Oct 22, 1844. This too failed, collapsing the movement. One follower described the days after the failed predictions, "The world made merry over the old Prophet's predicament. The taunts and jeers of the 'scoffers' were well-nigh unbearable."           1874  invisible return of Christ; Original position of the Watchtower. Then Charles Taze Russell predicted the Rapture in 1910, followed by End of the World in 1914--later interpreted as invisible return of Christ. (99 Reasons Why No One Knows When Christ Will Return, by B J Oropeza, Foreward by Hank Hanegraaff, IVP publishing, 1994)       1914   was one of the more important estimates of the start of the war of Armageddon by the Jehovah's Witnesses (Watchtower Bible and Tract Society). They computed 1914 from prophecy in the book of Daniel, Chapter 4. The writings referred to "seven times". The WTS interpreted each "time" as equal to 360 days, giving a total of 2520 days. This was further interpreted as representing 2520 years, measured from the starting date of 607 BCE. This gave 1914 as the target date.    1914  Charles Russell, after being exposed to the teachings of William Miller, founded his own organization - the Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1914 Russell predicted the return of Jesus Christ.    1914, 1918, 1920, 1925, 1941, 1975 and 1994   Jw’s: Here are other dates that the Watchtower Society predicted. 1975 looked likely as it was computed as the 6000th anniversary of the creation of Adam in the Garden of Eden in 4026 BCE. They interpreted Psalms 90:10 as defining the length of a generation to be 80 years. Since 1914 plus 80 equals 1994, they predicted Armageddon would occur around that year. The latest estimate was 6000 years after the creation of Eve, for which no date can be determined with any accuracy.    1914  End of World; Charles T. Russel, Jehovah's Witnesses; later explained that Michael (ie Jesus) had defeated Satan in heaven    1914  ; Jesus invisible and quiet return to the Earth. (Jehovah's Witnesses, Book: This Means Everlasting Life, page 221) "So A.D. 1914 marks the time of Christ's invisible return in spirit." Explained after they said he would return in 1914          1918  In 1918, new math didn't help the Jehovah's Witnesses from striking out again.           1925  The Witnesses had no better luck in 1925. They already possessed the title of most wrong predictions. They would expand upon it in the years to come.    1953-AUG:   David Davidson wrote a book titled "The Great Pyramid, Its Divine Message". In it, he predicted that the world would end in 1953-AUG.    1957-APR:  The Watchtower magazine, quoted (1) a pastor from California, Mihran Ask, as saying in 1957-JAN that "Sometime between April 16 and 23, 1957, Armageddon will sweep the world! Millions of persons will perish in its flames and the land will be scorched.'       1975  The Jehovah's Witnesses were back at it in 1975. The failure of the forecast did not affect the growth of the movement. The Watchtower magazine, a major Witness periodical, has over 13 million subscribers.    1975  Armageddon, 1975; Jehovah's Witnesses; (Various publication, cited in Newsweek Oct. 15, 1984)     1984  The Jehovah's Witnesses made sure in 1984 that no one else would be able to top their record of most wrong doomsday predictions. The Witnesses record is currently holding at nine. The years are: 1874, 1878, 1881, 1910, 1914, 1918, 1925, 1975, and 1984. Lately, the JW's are claiming they're out of the prediction business, but it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks. They'll be back.         In a moment of clarity, I peeked out of the WT$ cult cocoon and come to my senses.I came to the realization that they are just like the Moonies and all the other cults.
