      I'm counting down the days until football season starts. That way I can play Monday morning quarterback and post what I would have done during some games. Since that is still a few months away I'll have to find something to post about and put a creative twist on it.  I came home late one Saturday night (technicly Sunday morning) from a little camping trip. I pulled into my driveway and got out to start to unload all my stuff. My house is kinda on a hill with the garage actually being the basement. The driveway runs beside the house and curves in underneath it. I'm giving the descriptions just so you can have a better visual. Oh, it also helps increase my word count and space. Anyway, it was about 2 in the morning and I stepped out of my car with a few things and headed up to the side door. I don't have a garage door opener so I have to go back up to the house. As I was coming around the corner I see this cat just hauling ass across the street right towards me. When I first saw the cat racing at me, I froze and got into a semi defensive position. It didn't see me at first because I was behind a wall and wasn't in clear view until I turned the corner on the driveway, so for a split second I thought it was going to attack me. Now, I remind you, it was at 2 in the morning. You aren't exactly thinking clearly at that time. When the cat did see me it stopped and froze too. So there we were, me and this cat, frozen, just looking at each other. Both shocked to see other. Not exactly sure what the other one was doing. I'm not exactly sure how long we stood there staring at each other until it finally ran off another direction, but I can say it was definately the most awkward moment I have had with animal, cat or otherwise.

      Here are just a few things that I have often wondered about, some a little too much.  I'm always amazed that there aren't more mass traffic pile ups in Wal-Mart parking lots. Have you been to one lately? They're crazy. There's really no correct or standard way to get around. There are shoppers walking around, cars pulling in looking for the closest spot, cars backing up, and then random cars using the parking lot as a shortcut to get around a red light. Your only safe once you're actually within the white lines.  Every time a professional sports team wins a championship or title, no matter what the sport, they pull out caps and tee shirts that say they are the champs right after the game. My question is what happens to the losing teams' box of championship wear? Because you know they have to have a box stashed away. I'm assuming they can't be returned either. My theory is that the boxes are shipped away to third world countries for clothing assistance. Like if you would go to Guam you'd see a kid running around in a Carolina Panthers 2004 Super Bowl Champion tee shirt.  What exactly are high school dances for? You show up, there's music, food, drinks and, oh yes, the opposite sex. Most parents encourage their children to go because it's good social behavior or something like that. But aren't those dances really teaching us to go and hang out in bars and clubs? Most bars have music, food, drinks and the opposit sex. I really don't have a final thought on that, a friend brought that up the other day, and I've been puzzled ever since.  That's all I have for now. One of these days I'll think of a catchy phrase to end with or leave with a clever thought for the day, but haven't come up with anything original yet. Thanks for reading.

      Welcome to the life that is me. I hope you find some humor, insight and confusion in what I have to post. First off I'll explain my blog title of "All I Know" and the link name of "meatballsandwich." "All I Know" is the name of a song from one of my favorite groups,Caedmon's Call. It's also a damn good song. It's also a good name for something like this, because well, you write what you know. I may be wrong or ignorant on some subjects, but it's based on what I know. "Meatballsandwich" is kinda harder to explain. It goes back to when I was working part time as a tax preperar. Ok, the tax preperar part is kinda irrevelant. Anyway, one day after work I went to the Subway a few doors down from the office. Now keep in mind that it has been a long day and I am starving. I go in and order a meatball sandwich. The guy is preparing it and asks if I want cheese, I say "yes". Then he asks what I thought to be "Do you want the cheese melted?" I respond, "No thanks, it will melt in the sandwich." The guy gives me a strange look then says "I asked, how your day's going?" I know it's weird, considering the two phrases sound nothing alike. Anyway, I tell this humorus little incident to my brother and he laughs and also points out that the phrases aren't similar at all. Then I try to explain that I was really hungry and focused on food. I mean, I didn't care to carry on a conversation with the guy, I just wanted him to make my stupid sandwich. I jokingly tell my bro that as I left the office the ladies I work with said by and I responded with "Meatball sandwich!" So for a couple times, when we saw each other and left, we said "meatball sandwich" instead of "bye". That's where the name came from, along with it being a damn good meal.  Well, that's a little introduction. Hopefully there will be many more posts to follow. Thanks for reading.

      Ok, football season could not get here soon enough.&nbsp; On the bright side, hockey is coming back to KC. The UHL has expanded to Kansas City starting the 2004-2005 season. The puck drops again on Oct 15th. Watching impatient drivers always amuses me.&nbsp; I always like it when they come up right behind me and then cruise past when the slightes opening appears just so they can move up 8 more feet. Now, I'm all about passing slow drivers. They can be downright bothersome. The ones I'm talking about are the fighting for position movers. The ones who at a stop light change lanes if there is only 2 cars instead of 3. The ones who change lanes back and forth depending on which one is moving faster at the time.&nbsp; I have no mathematical evidence to actually figure out how little they are gaining by moving from lane to lane, just my own observation. One day on my way to work I kept track of pick who was doing the lane skip. We were going the same direction on a four lane road for about 4-5 miles. Speed limit was 40-45 mph.&nbsp; We started at about the same position, she changed lanes I least 7-8 times during those 4 miles. At the last stoplight before I had to turn into my work, she was 2 cars ahead me.&nbsp; 2 cars, about 16 feet is all she gained.&nbsp; I know this is just an isolated incident, but can all that shuffling really be worth it. I think there is some reason for the lane switching, but not all time. For an example, watch a NASCAR race. You will notice that not every car is going back and forth between lanes nor are they always trying to pass someone to get one mor car ahead. Just because a line is going fast one point, doesn't mean it will always be that way. Anyway, that's just something to think. Again I say, football season could not get soon enough. Until next time.
