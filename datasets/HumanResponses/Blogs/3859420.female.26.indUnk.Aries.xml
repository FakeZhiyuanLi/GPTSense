      Here are some new famous quotes (not Mark related for once!):  "So when is the b*tch getting married?"   girl: "So [president of company], my friend, xxx wants a drink with you!" president: "Oh, ok! I'll be right back!" [President does not come back and girl feels like big loser]  "I'm so happy this helmet fits my head!"

        Mark's new word:    Sherbert     Meaning:  Sh*t     Origin:  Some strange South African substitute word for sh*t.     Uses:    "Oh Sherbert!"     "Bull-Sherbert!"     "I was so Sherbert-faced last night!"     Why Mark uses this word:  It's clearly not because he doesn't like swearing! Maybe because he loves ice cream so much? Haha

      Oh why, oh why am I so clumsy? I can't count the number of times I've tripped over my own feet. Let's see, there was the time at the Grande theatre when I missed a step and slipped over 5 steps but still landed on my feet. Then there was the time I was walking to work from Union station when my my foot slipped out of the side of my sandal and I feel on my bum. And let's not talk about my latest horrific story - I was walking to the Eaton Centre and my foot slipped out of my SNEAKER. First I fell on my wrist but as I tried to get up, I lost my balance again and sprawled right on the sidewalk in front of whole crowd of people! Yes, I think that takes the cake.  So why do I keep tripping on my feet? Is it because it runs in my family? I could write a book on my family's accidents - Dad slipping on the stairs of the bus, Mom tripping over everything on the floor, Kirsten flipping at Eglinton station, or Russell falling out of a golf cart... It very well might be in the genes!  Well, I'd prefer not to blame my clumsiness on heredity since it would mean my problem cannot be fixed. I'd much rather blame it on the shoes. First of all, my feet are size 5 and also narrower than the average foot! All my shoes for the last five years have been too wide, too loose, too long. Recently, I bought a pair of Mags. These are the best shoes I've bought in ages! The shoe fits my foot perfectly and I have no quams about my feet slipping out. I have not tripped in four days and counting -- I think I've found the cure and I'm loving my new size 5's!!!!

      What is Marksism you ask? Do you mean the theories of Karl Marx on labor and society; a driving force in Communist and Socialist belief? No, that would be Marxism and no, I did not make a typo. Marksism is the inspiration for which my writings are based. It is based on the theories of Mark, my husband.   It was once revealed to me that Mark was named after Karl Marx. After doing a little research, here are some similarities I have come up with between Marx and Mark:     Marx  was born in Germany in 1818 just after the close of the Napoleonic wars.  Mark  was born in South Africa in 1973, a country that speaks Afrikaans that is somewhat similar to German AND his favourite historical figure is Napoleon.    Marx  was born into a progressive Jewish family in Trier, Prussia.  Mark  was born in South Africa, a country with a large Jewish population.    Marx  received good marks in gymnasium in high school.  Mark  received good marks in math, science, and english in high school    Okay, I guess it's a little far fetched. They aren't so similar after all. But I have to admit that Marksist quotes are much more amusing. Here is but an example:  "Gee xxx, your family is dropping off like flies"  "So xxx, did your grandma pop off yet?"  "Gee xxx, you are much more fun now that you're single!"  "You broke up with xxxx? Congratulations" *gets up to shake hands*  Insensitive? Naaaa.. Mark just doesn't hold back. This is why I love him so much. He provides me with endless entertainment and now he can provide you with endless entertainment too! So this is where my writings begin, "Marksist Quotes and other stuffs" - a collection of all the funny sayings and doings of Mark, my muse.  P.S. Love you Mark! Don't be mad!

      Last night I was making my lunch for work the next day - a spinach salad with celery and pears. "What would spice up my salad?", I thought. I opened my fridge and lo and behold, in front of me was the carton of fresh farm eggs we had bought just two days earlier at this great butcher at Woodbine and 16th.   hmmmmm.... Hard-boiled eggs! I love hard-boiled eggs! In China and Europe we ate hard-boiled eggs galore for breakfast. It was delicious! Hard-boiled eggs are one of my food obsessions!   So I brought out the pot, put my egg in and waited for the water to boil. Turned the heat down to a simmer. Ok. 9 minutes until my egg would be ready. "Let's go upstairs and check my email!", I decided. Checked my email and opened msn messenger to see who was online. Ok, so I started chatting with someone that I'm not so fond of but it could not be helped. I won't get into the nitty gritty, but let's just say one hour later of hell and ... Oh good god! My egg!!!! I ran downstairs. Hmmm... the egg  looked  ok. "Let's take it to work and see how it tastes", I reasoned. Damn! That was the worst tasting hard-boiled egg I have ever had! Note to self: Do not boil eggs for over an hour.  Needless to say, I will never forgive this person for ruining my hard-boiled egg.

      So we went to Licks today for dinner. Whenever we go there, Mark gets asked what his name is and they can never understand his South African accent! This is not the first time this has happened. It happens  everywhere . In a country that has every kind of accent under the sun, you would think someone would be able to understand him!  Now Mark must be the most common name on this planet. You don't get much more generic than Mark (unless your name is Michael or Chris). I once went to school with a guy named Mark Smith. You might as well call him John Doe. But funny enough, Mark has been called every name in the world that is not a real name! Here are the top examples:  3. Mock 2. Bark  ... And the number one is....  1. Box  I mean, have some common sense people! Who the heck is named Box? I know he has a funny accent but do we live in such a bubble that we can't adapt?
