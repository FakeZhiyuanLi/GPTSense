      This place is nuts. I don't know what else to say. I feel like the only one who hasn't really accepted the fact that I live here...Maybe I'm not meant to...But it does make me wonder if I'm not determined to never be happy anywhere I go. Then, the part of me that refuses to settle for isolated Southern towns in peanut country comes back and says "You're crazy. It's them that's loonified."  Must be all that dang book learnin'...

      It's now raining every day, sometimes twice...I have been trying to do my laundry for a solid week. Every time I start getting things together this act of God thunderstorm kicks up and I'm trapped in the house 'till morning. Aaaaaaaaaaack. I bought four shirts on Saturday in case this keeps up.

      Overheard in "the Wal Mart" Sunday night:  "I was born and breaded right here in 'mericus."   (Said proudly)    Would that be original recipe or extra crispy? I'm kind of shooting for extra crispy, because my dad would never let us get it when we were little kids.

      Argghhh...What's up with this crazy place? Nothing opens before 5pm on the weekends, and everybody's obsessed with Jesus. Several of my coworkers have bumper stickers on their cars that read "Jesus Is the Answer." I'm wondering what the question is. I love the way that total strangers are convinced they know what's best for other people...

      I have fallen into a hole and I can't climb out. What's with this place? I feel like the only one who realizes we're stuck out here in the peanut fields, a 45 minute drive from the next more interesting town...a 15 minute drive from some more disturbing places. Lookit, Americus: clean up your act, or I'm out.   PS: Why&nbsp;am I&nbsp;sticking around in Lameville, you ask?&nbsp;Answer: cool-ass job. Yeah, yeah, I should quit complaining, I know. But it's my blog, so deeeeeeal.

      Men&nbsp;are stupid.&nbsp; Why do I always end up dating the strange ones? They seem normal at first, I swear. But then they go to argue with me and make me read between the lines. This one lil boy I got now, I swear.&nbsp; When a girl comes to your house for a date, it's generally not good to make her watch the history channel with you for an hour before going out.  Why me? Why can't I find a nice normal boy who knows how to act on a date and doesn't feel the need to make me wanna strangle him?  Guys: stop being retarded. You'll get more girls to date you.

      Saw it. More or less liked it. It was darn entertaining, if a little confused as to whether it wanted to be a historical, literary or just plain made-up treatment of the Arthur story. But well worth the $1 I paid to see it. Yes, $1...   What I liked  Keira's outfits Keira's war paint bad guys falling in the water numbered children   What I didn't like  Plotty script Goofy narration Unnecessary whipping-up-the-troops speech before 2nd Saxon ass-whomping scene. Ick. Their editor must have quit and left an intern in charge.

      Hope everybody is thinking good thoughts this morning...maybe if we all concentrate real hard the Marriage Amendment bill will hit the garbage can like the lump of steaming hate crime-inspiring trash it is!!!! Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  --- Awwwwwww right! Thank you Senator Daschle and posse. I wonder who the conservatives will pick on after they evolve past their hatred of gays? Hmmm...we're running out of scapegoats...

      Altogether, the most confusing creatures that ever walked the earth. They act like they want you when they don't, and then when you get used to that, they start acting like they don't when they actually want to cook you dinner. How is a girl to sort it out?

      Just found out last night that my lil brother Leon is about to get engaged. He's been dating this girl for about 8 months or so, and he's already seen the Bling Man about her ring. Little worried because the girl is only 20 an seems kind of marriage-obsessed. But then that's how some girls are and they never wake up from it. Guess it isn't really any of my bidness anyway. Just would be nice if I had a boyfriend at least before my Lil Bruh gets betrothed...aaaaaaack...It's begun...  For any future husband types reading this: I want a princess cut, platinum band. Serious business.

       urlLink    I am Milton Waddams. Abuse me, please. I only give you the best half of my waking hours every week for paltry pay...  urlLink     When your boss sticks you in a whole other building and doesn't pay you any attention for days at a time, fails to give you your performance-based salary review as promised and then does one for people who started three months after you, and doesn't seem to know more than a rat's behind what you do from day to day, it's not really cool to call attention to minor mistakes you may or may not be making on a regular basis in front of another co-worker. Maybe I'm oversensitive. But sometimes I feel like the guy from Office Space who keeps getting his desk moved for no apparent reason. Fuck do you mean, "Do you *have* the AP state abbreviations list????" I've got it taped to my freakin' monitor. Lady, when you snoop my rough copy and find errors I haven't caught yet, you don't get to count that as "one of those things that's been sneaking through lately." If you have problems with my work, you should probably speak to me more often than, say, once every ten days. I'm just sayin'. Friggin' shite.Sometimes I wish people would just suuuuuuuuuuuuck on it.

      Weasel figured out how to jump on the kitchen counters on Saturday. My baby is growing up. :( Nub is so funny about it. Everytime Weaz gets on the counter, Nubbin goes in the kitchen with her so I can see who's being bad and who's being good. Or is she watching to make sure the baby doesn't fall and bump her head? I'm not sure. So I will most likely be spending this week Weasel-proofing the house. No more leaving lit torches lying around, I guess...pshhhh...   http://photos1.blogger.com/img/258/925/640/tussle.jpg >
