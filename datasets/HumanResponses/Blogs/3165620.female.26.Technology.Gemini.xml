      I went to another dress shop yesterday. The prices seemed a bit high until I learned that alterations were included. They didn't have much there to try on though, so I'd have to trust a catalog photo. I took a look at the website for one of the lines they carry and found  urlLink this one  which looks rather similar to the Jordan gown mentioned in an earlier entry. The website for that company is  urlLink www.bridaloriginals.com  and apparently they're orders come in comparatively quickly. (With many companies, it is already to late! Seems crazy to me.)  I think my favorite of the dresses I have tried on it the Jordan dress, but it is a bit sheer. I'm thinking of dress shopping with my sis when I'm in Indiana next week and then just ordering the darn dress if I don't find anything.

      I went to Brides by Demetrios yesterday after work. There was a pretty dress there that unfortunately is not pictured on the web.  So, I've tried on this dress, but it is $600, so I'm not going to get it.  "Well, it's a discontinued dress, so I guess we could discount it to $300 just for tonight."  I'm still not going to spend $300 without thinking about it, so I get back into my street clothes.  "We can get it down to $200, but the offer goes away when you leave." Hey, I came here straight from work and am not spending $200 on an empty stomach! "Well, if you need to sleep on it, we can extend the offer until tomorrow, but that's it."  They really wanted me to give them the $50 deposit before leaving the store. I might have done it if I could have gotten it back, but if I didn't buy a dress there the only thing I could have done with the $50 would be to buy something else at that store. I really can't justify spending my money on overpriced accessories.  I did like the dress and might have been willing to spend $200 on it, but not if I have to decide that fast. Somehow I think the odds of that exact dress being snatched up in the next week or so are pretty low, but that's the chance I take. I wonder if I could get them to give me the same bargain later?

      If I can get done with work early enough today, I'm going to try to go to a bridal shop recommended by a coworker. I might also try to swing by one of the places I've already visited later this week to see if my feelings have changed after looking at more stuff.

      So, I dared to go to David's Bridal last week. That place is crazy, but I did try on this dress. Not bad, but I'm not sure if it looked quite right on me.  urlLink http://www1.davidsbridal.com/bridalgowns_detail.jsp?stid=380&prodgroup=4  There is a second dress at David's that I also noted for consideration, but they don't seem to have it on the website, so no picture.  I tried this one on (in white) at a nice, friendly little shop. The only one they had was huge, so I was pinned into it to get an idea of how it would look. It's hard to get a good view of this dress with the model sitting so oddly.  urlLink http://www.jordanfashions.com/products.asp?nCatID=1&nProductID=237&nPhotoID=3457

      I've sent out invites for a few other people to join this blog. This may help exchange info without playing telephone tag.  I probably should actually post some content, so here goes. I haven't been to this site in a while, but I've found that the people at  urlLink Indiebride  tend to have a rather sane attitude towards the planning. (The horror stories on the message boards can be rather amusing, as well.)  I'll post more when I have something relevant to us going on.

      So, we printed out invitations tonight. (Oh no, we did it ourselves!) After some debate over wording and much fiddling with the margin sizes, we finally came up with something we were happy with. It took a while to print since we had to feed them in manually and the printer would decide that there was an imaginary paper jam every five cards or so.   We finally got to addressing the envelopes, which caused yet another round of confusion. I pulled out my Miss Manners books to clarify issues like "How do you address an invitation to a couple with different last names?" (Woman first, then the man on the next line.) Buck finished his family and went home. I think I'll finish mine tomorrow. Buck went a lot faster since I was trying to write in neat cursive and he just printed. If any Bordens or Creels are offended by the way the invitations are addressed, blame Buck. *grin* Of course, the flip side of that is that anyone in my family gets to blame me for any invitation improprieties.  We're using Buck's address as the return address since he lives in a house and can better receive massive amounts of mail. (My box in the apartment mailroom is small.) Also, his address is shorter!  I'm thinking of drawing up a map and/or directions to the church to include with the invitations to people who have never been there. That would be his family and whatever friends we invite. My family knows the way by now, although I might end up tossing maps in all the envelopes just to be sure.  Dude! It's nearly midnight! That's it, I'm going to go to bed and forget about wedding stuff until after work tomorrow.

      I know that these are low quality pictures, but that is what happens when you use a really old mirror to photograph yourself. Anyway, this is the veil that I got from Kirstin, since she didn't use it for her wedding. I've attached it with velcro to a hairclip. You can at least get an idea of the length here. I'm thinking of getting some sort of headpiece to go with it. I could get a tiara to kind of tie in to the sparkly beads on the bodice of the dress, perhaps.

      Got an email from  urlLink Hoosier Tent & Party Rental  with an estimate for a tent rental for about 50 people. Total cost, including tables, chairs, and setup, is a bit under $450. Around $100 of that is for the tables and chairs, if we need them.  We are considering having a tent outside the church for the reception, instead of using the downstairs area.

      This weekend, Buck called up Mike Black to make sure he actually owns a good suit for the wedding. Mike was a bit curious as to why Buck cared about his appearance. Apparently, Mike wasn't aware that he is the best man! Buck swears that he told him months ago, but somehow Mike didn't remember. It's a good thing we have that cleared up before the wedding!  So, just in case there is any confusion, Mike Black is the best man and my sister Kirstin is my matron of honor. (I'll have to talk to her about what to wear the next time I get her on the phone.) We aren't planning on having any other attendants, so that should simplify some of the organization.

      I've ordered the dress in size 12. (Apparently, this company actually runs true to street clothing sizes, unlike most wedding dresses.) The dress ship date is approximately July 30, and it usually takes about 5 business days from shipping for it to arrive.  I can get the dress fitted as soon as it comes in, provided I have shoes and undergarments ready. This dress is nice in that I could wear a normal bra if I wanted to, although I think I still will probably go out and buy something new for the special day. I'm thinking maybe a slip to keep me from being paranoid that the dress is too sheer. (I don't think it actually is, but white undies under white dress do generally show through.)  Last time I was in the dress shop I had Buck take a picture of me with the dress pinned on, so pester me if I don't get around to posting that sometime soon.  On a side note,  thank you to Mom  for sending me a list of family addresses.  Thank you to Mom, Dad, and Kirstin  for emailing ideas and information. I'm sure Buck and I will be pestering you further soon.

      I did a quick online search to see what we need to get a license.  Looks like it'll cost more for us since we are out-of-state residents.  I'll need to give some sort of documentation showing that I have been inoculated against rubella. I know I had to show that I was before I went to college, but it wasn't quite clear what would be acceptable, so I may have to get a blood test to convince the state that I won't be catching German measles and bearing deformed children.  It wasn't clear what identification we would need to present to get a marriage license. I know that Kirstin had to update her driver's license before she could get one, but I don't know if that was because she had an old name on it or if they are picky about the address given. I'll need to find out so we can make a trip to the MVD and officially become New Mexican drivers if we need to.  What county should we get the license from, since we don't live in Indiana ourselves? Does it matter?  Next time I chat with Mom, I'll ask her to look into any of this stuff that I can find out with some more in-depth searching from here.

      I called the dress shop this afternoon. The dress I was interested in isn't in hanging stock, but it can arrive in 4-6 weeks with a $20 rush fee.  So, $250 dress + $20 rush + $X alterations, I guess.

      We bought wedding bands on Saturday. One of the jewelry stores in the mall was having a 10% off sale that day. I would have preferred to buy from something a bit more local than Kay Jewelers (Of the stupid "Every kiss begins with Kay" commercials.), but plain gold bands cost about the same everywhere, it seems, so we might as well buy at a sale. Buck chose a  plain gold band, and I picked one with milgrained edges. We are such exciting people. *grin*  In other wedding shopping news, I'm about to buy a dress. I'm going for the Jordan dress I mentioned a while back. Apparently, if it is in stock in my size, it can be here in about two weeks. If they actually have to make a new one for me, I'll have to pay a small rush fee ($20 or so) to get it in about a month. The shop said to call them today after 3:00 and  they'll let me know what is in stock.

      I was going to go to the wedding shop today, but now it is too late to get there before they close. I guess I'll just have to go tomorrow.  I just haven't been able to bring myself to buy a dress just yet. (Which is very bad, since these things require an insane lead time.) It's all well and good to play dress-up, but do actually pick one and put my money down, well! I'm a horrid shopper for everyday clothing, so this is even worse.  Oh, well. I'll live.

      The other day Buck and I were discussing wedding favors and agreed that we probably didn't need them. However, if we did have them, we decided they would have to be something interesting, like little jars of green chile.  It probably isn't the best of ideas, since not everyone has killed their taste buds like we have, but it provided a bit of amusement. Picture some of our relatives trying to figure out what the stuff is!

      My dress came in this week. I went to the shop to try it on yesterday. It's a little loose in the shoulders and needs hemming, which I expected since they make these things for women who are five inches taller than me, but otherwise it fits fine. This weekend I need to buy my shoes so the alterations lady will know how much to hem it when I see her next week.

      So, we went looking at china patterns yesterday. Lots of very similar looking white-with-metal-band plates, with the main difference in the basic set being the teacup shape. Pretty much all the china is dishwasher-safe, but metal decoration generally prevents you from putting it in the microwave. (Not that I'd generally want to do that, but you could picture someone trying to reheat a cup of tea without thinking or something.) Apparently, the technology to make microwave-safe metal-decorated china now exists.  Buck located  urlLink an example of this sort of china  and can also explain how they probably make it work.   I'm not sure how comfortable I am with the idea of getting brand new dishes, but I suppose some of that is a combination of "don't be greedy", "just make do with what you have", and a tendency to get decent hand-me-downs. I had some of the same issue with registering in general, but somehow the china, etc. bothers me more. Maybe it is because the general registry seems to be giving general guidelines for the  kind  of stuff we could us, while picking a china pattern dictates a specific product. Maybe part of it is that a whole set of dishes is a such big item. If someone bought us some sheets that we didn't pick, we could still use them just fine, but if someone bought us a couple of place settings in a different pattern it would clash on a holiday table. Maybe part of what bothers me is that it is such a public item. No one is going to know if all of our towels match, or if our sheets are strange colors, or if the cookware is all the same brand, but if you are having a fancy dinner with fancy plates, you know that is one thing people will see. (They still probably won't  care , considering that Buck and I had dinner with a couple who were impressed that we had cloth napkins, but still...)  I'm probably just channeling some wedding anxiety into a silly area right now. Better I get oddly introspective about plates than become all freaky and controlling, I suppose.

      I took the invitations down to the post office today. 33 invitations x 37 cent per stamp = $12.21 postage. I really wonder how the people with hundreds of invitations manage to get it all done! I suppose they have invitation assembly parties or something, justifying their absurdly large number of attendents. (I find myself thinking of the wedding Buck and I went to of a coworker of his. She apparently invited 350 people! Dude!)

      Got an email from the tent people. They generally try to set up the day before the wedding, which means that won't hold up the caterer the next day.  I got the maps to print off tonight and stuffed them in the envelopes with the invitations. I'll be mailing off 32 invitations with a maximum guest count of 63. Of course, some of these people probably won't be able to come, and it is quite possible that we'll sheepishly realize we forgot someone and fire off a delayed invitation or two, but the bulk of it is taken care of. I just need to seal them and get them posted.  I'm starting to think this might just work out!

      I went over to the  urlLink Linens 'n Things website  and tweaked the registry a little. They have a place to enter decor preferences, but they don't let you say much. Maybe if I actually had color schemes or something I wouldn't need much room, but trying to use the space to say things like "We don't have a dining room table yet so we don't know what size/shape tablecloth we'll need" seems to strain the system.  I put a comment under Living Room Decor that I am fond of dark green. It's hard to get dark shades of green. More often you run across washed out shades like seafoam, or overly bright shades like lime. We're registered for blue plaid flannel sheets. I was more into the solid hunter green ones, but Buck isn't keen on dark sheets. I let him have this one since I already own a set of queen-sized plain cotton sheets in a nice dark green.   Anyone who reads this blog,  please  do not try to figure out some sort of decorating scheme from the registry. We just aren't that sort of people. Sometimes I wonder what life would be like if I were...  I was talking to the caterer today and told her I like green, like in ivy and stuff, so I'm thinking that will probably be the main non-white color involved in the wedding decor. I guess maybe I can check "Pick some stupid colors, already!" off my to-do list. (That is an actual quote from my Outlook task list.) I figure green will provide a good color to go with whatever sort of flowers we pick.  I have no idea what sort of flowers to get. I know that Buck is not very fond of chrysanthemums, and he likes roses (probably because that is what he buys me sometimes). I wish we could use peonies, but they'll probably be out of season by then. How long are the peonies in bloom, anyway? (I'm not about to pay way extra for out of season flowers that no one will notice.)   I'm thinking I might forgo the bouquet toss, since there hardly is anyone to catch it. On the other hand, those few ladies might still want to go for it... Perhaps I should get some feedback on this.

      Last week, we took a look at a house to rent that we really liked. It's located pretty close to where Buck is now, within walking/biking distance of campus for him, not much farther away from KAFB than where I am now (just in a different direction). The owners live just a few blocks away and have taken really good care of the place. Anyway, we didn't have high hopes of getting it, since several other people had expressed interest in it before us, but today I had a message from the owner and when I called him back he said we can rent it. Yay! I think we must have been bumped up the list since there are only two of us, we aren't undergrads, and we have no pets.  It has three bedrooms, which is more than we really need, but I'm sure we'll find a use for the extra space. It might be good for Buck to have his own personal office where he can work on his thesis at odd hours, and I'm daydreaming about having a dedicated yarncrafting space. There are a couple of big trees in the backyard, so we'll have nice shade outside. The next-door neighbor is a cop; I imagine having a police car parked over there might deter criminals on that block a bit. There is a nice neighborhood park about two blocks away.  You all get to find out about this before Buck does, since he's en route to that class right now. I sent him an email to let him know we don't have to worry about find housing anymore.

      I have a meeting at 8:30 tomorrow morning, and here I am, still up after 11:30. If I don't go in early, I won't be able to leave early, and if I don't leave early, I won't be able to pack for my flight on Tuesday without staying up late. My sister's wedding is next weekend, and I'm flying home early enough to get some good family time in. My sibling and I intend to go shopping for a wedding dress for me. I haven't found something out here, so I'm hoping that I can find something at the same store where she got her dress.  I'm going log on and check my work email in the small hope that tomorrow's meeting has been cancelled. Of course, even if it has been cancelled, I should go to bed and get up early. If I don't go to work early, I should get some clothing together for my trip. (My flight is early on Tuesday morning, so I have to make sure I pack the night before.

The website encourages  people to  Read ,  Register , and then  Release   their books "into the wild" and then track where they go and the  lives they touch. Great concept... share your books and follow  their progress forever. Best of all, it's  FREE .   Help spread the word by forwarding this to your friends, and  of course be sure to visit     www.BookCrossing.com  !    Personal message from Brooke:  After recently picking up a lot of material for $2/bag at the big library booksale, I've decided I should start using my bookcrossing account again. Many of these books will be appreciated much more by letting other people have them than by just sitting in a box or on a shelf in my apartment.

      85 degrees Fahrenheit, 12% humidity   This morning there was a man with a jackhammer outside my office window. I'm not sure why he was tearing up the pavement, but it was nearly impossible to get any work done until he stopped. It was really loud and the floor was shaking. Why couldn't they have waited until people weren't working in here? Was it that urgent to dig a trench today?

      I went to a nursery yesterday afternoon and bought some plants for my patio. If all goes well, I'll have a nice supply of herbs all summer, and if all goes very well, I'll be able to harvest some tomatoes. (I'm not sure how well tomatoes will grow in containers, but it is worth a try.)  I have a few avocado pits in water that are sending up shoots. I'm hoping to get a decent avocado plant or two from them.  I've been thinking I should dig out my sprouting jar and buy some seeds. I used to grow alfalfa sprouts all the time, but got out of the habit when the jar was boxed up for an apartment move. I was reminded of it when I saw a book on sprouting a the used book store yesterday.

      I had stuff I should have done yesterday, but I mostly just sat around the house knitting. (At least it wasn't a total loss. I got a few more inches done on a shawl for my mother.) Today is shaping up to be just as slow. Here it is after noon and my biggest accomplishment is that I've showered and washed my hair. I'm living the high life now!  I'm thinking of going out to a plant nursery and picking up some herbs that I could grow in containers on my patio. The sunlight out here should be great for plants, provided I remember to water them enough.  I still need to come up with a gift for my sister. I'll be flying over a few days early, so I might put it off until I get there so I don't have to wrangle a package on the plane.

      My FMIL bought me a couple of wedding planning books. The timeline given starts at least a year in advance. Apparently I'm really rushing things by not being in the finishing stages by now (with over three months until W-day). I don't think my attention span is long enough to start planning a party that early. At least I am able to save effort by skipping a lot of the nonsense in those books.   Engagement announcements? Anyone who doesn't know already isn't close enough to us to care. Engagement party? Come on, who really has those? Lots of expensive stuff that nobody notices or cares about? Ha!  Yes, planning this thing remotely will probably drive me nuts, but at least it isn't going to drag on forever. I refuse to let this take over my life!

      I just realized that I haven't gotten a gift for my sister's wedding, which is coming up in about two weeks. I would have liked to have knit them something, but at this point there is no way my needles would be able to fly that fast.  Hmm, what on earth would they like? They already have a well-equipped household between the two of them. (Actually, I think my sister alone was set up pretty well, so adding her fiance's stuff ensures it.)  Perhaps some sort of southwestern-themed item? (After all, I do live all the way out here, so I should take advantage of what is in this region.) I don't want to give them a useless dust-collector, though. I must think upon this.

I really hope this whole knitting controversy isn't going to get out of hand.

      Some paranoid person at work thinks that it looks bad for me to knit during meetings. It's not as if I do it when I'm actually part of the meeting, but if I'm going to be stuck in a four hour meeting as an observer with nothing to contribute, I need to keep my hands busy to pay attention. I was sitting off in the back of the room out of the way! I bet this guy wouldn't have had any problem if I had paid no attention at all and doodled on a piece of paper, but since I had my yarn out it could "give the wrong impression to the customer". What impression is that, that people in our company are capable of multitasking? I wonder if he is one of those people who can't walk and chew gum at the same time?  Anyway, just because of one anti-knitter in another department, I'll have to find something else to do if I'm ever in one of those interminable meetings with people from outside my department. Knitting was perfect. I could channel my fidgeting into something constructive, and I didn't have to look at my hands while I did it. *sigh* Oh, well. I guess I may just have to give up on paying attention in those things. I have a another long meeting in the morning, so I'd better come up with something quick.  I'm not feeling as light-headed now. I think drinking a bunch of water and just sitting in my office all afternoon helped my body recover a bit from the blood donation.

      I just gave blood today. Feeling kind of light-headed, but not too bad. Two months ago when I gave, I got really pale and dizzy. I suppose it was rather shocking to my system to have a pint of blood drawn just when my body was finally adapting to the altitude.  I think I'll have a hamburger or some other meat for supper tonight to make up for the lost iron and stuff. I also think I'd better not try to make any major design decisions on my code today, since I'm not exactly working at full capacity right now.  Time to get another drink of water and go back to work.

Of course, I've started a couple of new projects while I was waiting, so now I have to choose what I should try to finish first.  No new knitting projects until I free up at least one set of needles!

      He's back! I saw the  urlLink creepy naked guy  again last night. He was wandering around on the lawn in front of my building. Once again, he was gone before the cops arrived.  I've talked to the people in the leasing office and they said that they had reports of a naked guy in the complex last summer. Needless to say, they weren't pleased to learn that he has returned. It's something of a relief to learn that this is more of a local nut than someone who is just targeting me. They said they hadn't had any reports of him knocking on doors before, but it is possible that no one else had been awake to hear him if he did.   Anyway, I'm definitely going to stay alert (as if I could do otherwise with this creepiness going on), but for now this guy seems more pathetic than scary. (Especially when contemplated in the light of day.) Apparently, in one of the sightings last summer he was riding a bicycle around the tennis courts. I would think a man would be living somewhat dangerously to ride a bike naked!  The leasing office is going to see if they can get APD to up their patrols in the area or something, so we'll see what happens.

Also, it is important to separate who you  are  from what you  do .  With getting married soon, it is probably a very good idea for us both to be more fiscally aware before we merge finances. I know we both live within our means, but  how much  within our means? At what point could we become financially independent? I should start tracking this stuff. (Well, first I'm going to finish the book. Then, I'll go back and start working through the steps it contains.)

      My wake-sleep cycle has been shifted off by several hours lately. (Creepy naked guy in the middle of the night didn't help that any. I haven't seen him again, fortunately. I'm hoping it was a one-time drunken idiot sort of thing.) I'd much rather be working something normal like 8-5, or 9-6, instead of the 11-8 I've slipped into of late. (I work 9 hour days Monday-Thursday and get alternate Fridays off.) I think I'll have to force myself to just go to bed really early to reset my clock. (Staying up and wrapping around never works very well, but I often tried it in college.)  I think I'm going to go bonkers with the wedding planning soon. My fiance will be going to a class out of town for a couple of weeks soon, so it would be really good to have most things nailed down before he is gone. Bleh!

      Last night around 12:30 some weird naked guy came knocking on my door. He asked if I wanted to go swimming, told me not to be scared (yeah, that always reassures people!), and said  he had enjoyed watching me . That last bit is what freaked me out enough to call the police. Of course, he was gone by the time they arrived. I had my fiance come over and stay to make me feel safe enough to sleep.  I'm not sure which is a creepier thought, that this nut might have been peeking past my bedroom blinds and watching me in some state of undress, or that he enjoyed watching me sit on the couch in my living room watching late-night television. Either thought is quite disturbing. I think I'll be keeping my blinds shut at night now.  I'm wondering where this guy came from. Does he live in my complex? Would I recognize him if I saw him in the mailroom? What would I do if I did?   *sigh*  It's a strange world. I suppose that after enough time goes by, this will become one of those odd stories you tell at parties, but for now, I'm still a bit on edge.

      I had such nice success at the end of last week that I tried to continue it this morning by adding a new clever trick to my code. Unfortunately, that broke the program in a mysterious way and I had to revert most of it back to the backup version. So much for being clever. Tomorrow, I'll come back and add the functionality with a more plodding, brute force technique. (I hate it when I have to resort to that.)  In other news, my fiance gave me the wonderful birthday present of a set of new bobbins for my spinning wheel! He used some nice, pretty wood for them. (Walnut, rosewood, and one other type that I can't remember.) Isn't he great? As soon as the finish is dry on them, I'm going to try them out spinning some more yarn for my mother's shawl.

      I've spent the past two days restructuring code and just now restored the original behaviour. At least I did find a couple of bugs in a code library.  I'm about to move some functionality into a new class. I'm hoping that it doesn't break it all over again.   Unlike when I was trying to get some toy project to work for a class in school, I actually care about doing this stuff right. (Well, I cared about it in school, too, but didn't have as much time to devote to it.) Once I finish getting this framework set up, we should see some impressive progress. Unfortunately, while I set up the framework, it doesn't look like much is happening. Oh well.  The wind is from the east today, so the humidity is all the way up to 20% or so. I never thought I'd be saying "up to" 20%. There are actually some clouds in the sky today. It was almost overcast this morning. I'm glad I flew back to my hometown for my sister's wedding last week. I was starting to miss rain.  It was a lovely wedding. I think they'll be very happy. Unfortunately for me, I no longer can use my sister's wedding to distract my mother from my own plans (or lack thereof). I have to get my act together!

      The sunlight through the window is making me sleepy.  Today I managed to locate a bug in someone else's code without making much progress on my own. I spent some time tidying up a couple of files while waiting for the bugfix.  Now it looks like the bug isn't completely gone. Maybe I should just go home. I stayed a bit late yesterday, so I could probably justify leaving work a little on the early side today, especially since I can't do much on that project until the problem is fixed. I know it is probably a problem with the bugfix, because I hadn't changed my part of the code there. Knowing it is "somebody else's problem" is occasionally good, as long as the "somebody else" does something about it in a timely fashion.

      I've been rearranging code today with nothing to show for it. *sigh* Sometimes being a computer scientist can be rather frustrating.  My officemate is beating on some code with a metaphorical sledgehammer. I've been there before.  Occasionally, I'd like to actually work with physical objects instead of just manipulating a virtual world. I think that is part of the reason why I enjoy knitting so much. There I actually can see what I have done, as opposed to looking at an apparently unchanging computer.   Okay, grumbling break is over. Back to work!

      I paid off my car last month and just got the title in the mail today. No longer am I beholden to the Bank of America. The car is mine, free and clear.  If I were a pessimist, I would expect something to fall off the car tomorrow. :)

      The guy down the hall from my office doesn't seem to understand the you don't actually need to speak loudly to be heard at the far end of the phone line. As far as I can tell, he's trying to get his message across without the benefit of technology.

      I had my eyes examined today. My precription has changed a bit. They gave me a new pair of contact lenses to try out and have checked in a week. If my eyes don't complain I'll buy a year's supply of them. Things always look a little surreal with an updated precription. I never realize how much I adapted to slightly outdated lenses until I get new ones and everything is extra-sharp again.  I also got a new pair of glasses and let myself be talked into buying a nice pair of sunglasses. They had a discount for the second frames, and sunglasses are ever so important out here. I do have to admit that they seem to fit better that the cheap pair I had been using. My old pair has now been downgraded to backup status.  So, I've taken advantage of my vision plan. Next up, find a dentist and use that dental coverage. Yay, job with good benefits!

      Sexy knitting is the theme of the most recent issue of  urlLink knitty.com , an online knitting magazine that I only recently discovered. Kind of contradicts the stereotype of knitters being old granny types, doesn't it? (Of course, one could say that non-orientable knitting also goes against the stereotype...)

      I'm mostly done  urlLink knitting a projective plane hat  from  urlLink Nate's pattern . It has been one of the most trippy pieces of knitting that I've ever done. I've been using a long circular needle instead of the 10 double-points that he used, but I think I'm going to have to switch to dpns myself before I can graft it together at the top. I'll have to wait until I go home for that, since it'll take more concentration than I can give it while waiting for my code to compile and run.

      So, his flight was originally scheduled to arrive a bit after 9:00 tonight, but bad weather means it hasn't even taken off yet. According to  urlLink American Airlines , it should arrive sometime after 11:30. Dang it, I'm getting all twitchy! I had been playing  urlLink Button Men , but I've caught up on all my open games. If the flight was on time, I would be leaving for the airport soon, but now that would be silly. I suppose I should get myself something to eat. I had been delaying supper with the thought of grabbing a bite together once he arrived.  *sigh*  I'll guess I'll just sit around reading, knitting, and/or websurfing to pass the time.

      It's pouring rain outside. I hope it doesn't get the inside of my car all wet. I think I cracked the rear windows to try to keep it from getting too hot in the intense sunlight. Not much likelyhood of that right now, although I can see plenty of clear sky towards the horizon.  Wow, thunder! That was loud!  Hmm, I wonder if it is really a good idea for me to keep working on the computer right now. (Yes, I'm looking for an excuse to go home. *grin*)

       urlLink Dialect Survey   Some people at Harvard made an interesting (albeit unscientific) online survey about how people speak in America. Check out the nifty maps!

      The doorknob problem yesterday was fixed by the time I got back home. They always seem to fix problems like that right away. Too bad they can't do something about the Creepy Naked Guy (who I haven't seen again, thankfully).

      ...and I feel fine! I usually get so woozy after giving blood that feeling normal is a big deal for me. The last couple of times I donated, they had to elevate my legs and bring out the ice packs, but this time they elevated my legs while I was bleeding for them. Aside from some pain when I bend my left arm (I think they hit a valve), I'm feeling good. Yay!

      This morning as I was leaving for work, the doorknob came off my front door! What is up with that?

      I found the  urlLink website for my pedometer  and they sell clip repair kits! It will be cheaper (and less wasteful) to repair the clip than to buy a new pedometer.

      I broke the clip on my pedometer. I've rubberbanded it to my belt to see if it will still work that way until I can get a repair kit.

      I give up. My code has some bizarre dependencies in it that shouldn't be there and are causing some annoying behaviour. I'll deal with this when I come back in tomorrow.

      Last week, I went down to the Verizon store and bought myself a cell phone. I have a flip phone, so I can pretend like I'm Captain Kirk or something. *grin*  So far, I like it. The sound quality is good and it is nice to be able to talk on the phone while taking a walk down the recreation trail down the street. I think I won't really know how good it is until I've received a few bills, though.

      Nate Berglund has a web page on  urlLink knitting one-sided surfaces . I did a mobius scarf (I still wear it in winter)and a klein bottle hat (rather pathetic looking, unlike his) before he ever learned to knit, but now he has far surpassed me in the geek knitting department. He has knitted a really freaky projective plane hat! I'm going to have to try that one out, myself.

      There is something vaguely depressing about watching fireworks by yourself. From where I live, I can look out across the city and see the tops of at least three big fireworks displays, plus whatever explosives the neighbors decide to light. There was a woman and her son lighting Roman candles in the parking lot when I came back inside.  I just hope nothing big catches on fire tonight. We've had some rain, so it isn't as dry as it was, but I still worry that some idiot kids may decide to set off bottle rockets too close to the bosque or something.  I'm trying to decide if I want to bother taking tomorrow off or if it would be better to earn a day of flextime. I doubt I'd be able to get much of anything done on the home front, so maybe I should just go to work. I have a morning meeting on Tuesday, and I'm afraid I'll have a terrible time waking up for it after an extra-long weekend.

       urlLink Rudy's "Country Store" & Bar-B-Q   I gave Dad some of this stuff for Father's Day. Unfortunately, I bought the bottle at my local Rudy's and mailed it to him, so it cost a lot more than it would have if we'd ordered off the website. Any future BBQ sauce needs he has will have to be taken care of that way. Ooh, they have the spice rubs there too!  Dang it, I shouldn't websurf like this when I'm hungry. I'm not always much of a fan of the "piles of meat" restaurant, but occasionally it is good.

      I need to  urlLink contact PNM  to notify them I am moving out this month. I also must transfer my phone service. Fortunately,  urlLink Qwest  has an online service for me to do that, athough it looks like I won't get to keep the same phone number at the new place.
