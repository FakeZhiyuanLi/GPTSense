      Alright for those of you people who are not aware of this Apsara Award, this is one of the many many film fare awards they already have and this one is the latest to the list.  Earlier there used to be Filmfare Awards, National Awards and State Awards may be, but off late huh the cine industry people themselves lost count of the awards.  It has become like a birthday party, a get together like thing these days.  We nows have Bollywood Awards, Sony Awards etc.  All the top organization who are linked with the entertainment industry have one award every year.  They are poorly organized and no rules for selecting the best actor or the actress.  The committe members for these awards are not professionals and are very biased.  In one such award ceremony Aamir Khan's Lagaan bagged all the awards.  Well agreed its a good movie and may be should have bagged the best movie, music and actor and not definetely for best costume and actress.  Give me a break.  The only costume in that movie was given to those English people and the villagers just wore a cotton dhothi.  And Gracy Singh was there only for singing some songs with our hero.  The reason is most of these votings are done by the actor, actress and others who are involved in cine industry only who are biased sometimes, well most of the times.  Many people know in advance about the results for these types of awards and only few grace the occassions well dressed and others dont bother to turn because they know that another award ceremony is round the corner.  But for Apsara Awards I guess there are 175 committe members with good experience taking care of the nominations and the winner.  PriceWaterhouseCopper who take care of the Oscar balloting are taking care of this balloting for Apsara Awards.  So is this Apsara Awards going to be the Indian Oscars....  Let us see that on May 29th in Mumbai  Scribbled by Anand

      Watching Rajni movies is the Tamil Nadu cricketers' way of relaxing abroad: Balaji  India 's popular fast bowler Venkatapathy Balaji has made two revelations.  The first is that he is a "big fan" of Rajnikanth. And the second is that almost all Tamil Nadu cricketers are also crazy about the actor, popularly known as Rajni.   Balaji boasts that he has seen Rajni's Baasha "at least a hundred times". He says watching Rajni movies is the Tamil Nadu cricketers' way of relaxing when they are abroad.   Former India captain and today's commentator 'Kris' Srikkanth too is an avid Rajni fan. His favourite film song, Srikkanth said in a television programme, was Thillaanna, Thillaanaa featuring Rajni and Meena in the super hit Muthu .

      Laloo Prasad Yadav, the man behind Bihars growth if any said Advani forged his affidavits.  Talking to reporters in Patna he claimed to have got the affidavit on the internet which mentioned Advani had graduated in Law from a Mumbai University in 1942, while on the other hand he had submitted that he did his tenth from a Sind College in 1944 and matriculated from St. Patrick High School (Karachi) in 1947.  Great concern for our new Railway Minister.  He cannot withstand this type of forgeries.  Hell with him.

      Holy Cow  Laloo Prasad Yadav should definetely be upset when he was denied the home minister post.  An educated man who fought for the upbringing of Bihar with no criminal record and no major scam behind him should be given that post.  Well the fodder scam was just 900 crores (No one knows how much Bofor's scam cost).  To honour him for what he has done to Bihar Congress gives him the Railway department.  Well what do you know, he may bring some in some great ideas like no need of rails, trains can run on roads and keep people's money safe with him. And any more train accidents please dont report to Laloo he is busy taking care of his kids (he lost count how many but).    Mr Karunanidhi is back into action: commanding, demanding and threatening...  Well these people were there in the past and we knew about them and again we elect them.  So none of them will change, neither them nor us.  Election 2004 has been a big mockery... and right from the PM post to every other post no one knew who is going to be whom.  People were left guessing.    Hard luck Ramvilas Paswan, better luck next time.  May be the scams you were involved were not high enough to get you a top position.  Work hard and cross the 900 crore mark.

      Well well well  I really cant believe whats happening... I am really very happy to see that India is going to have a right person as the Prime Minister.  Manmohan Singh is a great Economist and he really saved India from bankruptcy in 1991 by bringing in daring rules.  I am sure he can still do similar works.  As with Sonia, I am still confused of why she did not take up the post.  But I have to agree she has brain which most of our India politicians lack.  She mentioned that she was not interested in that post and she wanted to preserve Indian culture and tradition.  A born Italian knew Indian culture and tradition where as people like Mulayam Singh Yadav doesnt even know a drop of what she meant.  He threatens to resign from Lok Sabha which I am sure he will not.  He has no values....

      With dramatic events happening in India, the whole country is watching who is going to rule them.  What a shame!  People voted without knowing who is going to rule them.  People elected a party which did not know who their leader is.  But out of all these bad things, one good thing is Antonio Maino (Sonia) is not going to be the PM (I hope that these worthless left party supporters who want to save their power dont create another confusion).  These shameless people are not bothered who rules them or what happens to our country.  They just want their minister post, money, money and more money.  Hell with these people and shame on our people to still have them as leaders.

      It is really very sad to see that no one from one billion people is found eligible to rule our country.  Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a true leader and he did a great job.  I dont understand why people want a change when things are going good.  This will stop the good things that was going in full swing and will take another couple of years for the ruling party to do some real good things.  And by the time those good things start to take effect that party is thrown out. Looks like we need a change in our system.

      I watched this movie couple of months back and I was pretty confident that this movie will create a sensation in Hindi film industry. But guess what, it has created more sensation in South India. There is a remake of this movie in Telugu (Sankar Dada MBBS, starring Chiranjeevi) and in Tamil (Vasool Raja, starring Kamal). And there is going to be a sequel of this movie in Hindi, "Munnai Bhai LLB", the story of Munnai Bhai before he met Suman (Gracy Singh) and chose to become a doctor. Well the reason for scribbling this piece is, will the remakes be a success too. I say a 50-50 chance. This is because more than the hero of the movie Sanjay Dutt (of course he did a good job) the credit goes to his assistant Circuit. He was awesome and if you had watched the movie carefully, in almost every comedy scenes he was definetely involved. The entire hilarios parts in the story were built around Circuit (Arshad Warsi). Can Prabhu and Srikanth do justice to this role in Vasool Raja and Sankar Dada MBBS is a big question? This is because, when there is no bench mark for what you are doing, then whatever the result is, it is going to be good (unless you make is delibrately look bad). Regarding direction and story there is going to be no big difference, it is going to be a carbon copy, but when it comes to acting Kamal and Chiranjeevi will do their job but I personally feel both Prabhu and Srikanth cant perform better than Jimmy Shergil. May be Kamal should have swapped his role with Prabhu and made his role bit more important in Vasool Raja. That would have been interesting to watch. Anyways we just got to wait and watch. Hats off to the entire crew of Munnai Bhai MBBS. BTW whats up with this Mahesh Bhatt !!!, he is in a different track these days.   Scribbled by M. Anand

      Been a long time since I scribbled.  NBA is done and Pistons have convincingly defeated Lakers and completely changed their future.  With Phil Jackson opting out for coaching and Kobe's contract dangling and not so surprising news, Shaq requesting for a trade if Phil is out.  And as we know Malone is done and I guess so is Payton or may be he will join Pistons for 100K this time.  This leaves the team with young players and rookies like Rush, Walton, Madvendeko and others.  So my guess is that Lakers are not going to be a threatening team as they were for atleast another two three years.    Alright now coming to our main discussion, Michael Schumacher and F1.  6 times world champion is on fire this time.  He has won 8 of 9 races this season (lost the Monaco race because of Montaya who tried to overtake him).  In Indy right in the first lap he took the lead over his team mate Ruben Barichello and thats it, there was no turning back for him after that, he maintained a solid lead from there.  His team mate finished second comfortably before Sato who was trailing by 22 seconds.  With better machines and research work done on Williams and McLaren, Ferrari still comfortably dominates the constructor table with 142 points followed by Renault and Bar Honda.  What happened to Williams and McLaren?  They are not able to finish the races...  My feeling is the drivers right now are not challenging.  During Hakkinen, Hill, Villineuve and Schumacher period,  F1 was far more interesting with each one fighting for the podium.  There was always a nail biting finishes, but after they left it was all Schumacher.  No competition and no nail biting finishes.  They later had to change the rules to make it interesting, resulting in Kimi making the last year race worth watching.  But this year, the results are already well defined.  At this rate if Schumi wins another three more races he is done for the season.  He will break records for winning the most world championship, the most races in a season etc etc and win the championship.  So has the quality of drivers got bad or has Schumacher got better.  Let us wait and see what happens in France.  Comments....  Scribbled by M.Anand

      Actually I wanted to write about Tampa Bay Lighting winning the Stanley Cup, but yesterday I was watching a tamil song program and was surprised to see more than 80% of the heroines I saw in those songs had no tamil background.  Well I am not a type person who is against things like this ("anti" group), but the question that struck me was "Are we out beautiful tamil girls?"  In 1970 till 1990 actresses like Hemamalini, Padmini, Sridevi, Ambika, Radha and other ruled the film industry.  I need not raise the topic whether they were good looking or not.  Hemamalini and Sridevi were prominent not only in tamil films but were well known in Hindi, Telugu etc meaning they were prominent nation wide.  About Ambika and Radha, the sisters more than good looking had some quality acting too with them.  Looking back some 5 6 years we had heroines like Ranjitha, Meena, Ramya Krishnan and others.  Things were fine even when Kushboo and Nagma moved in, but it really started to make a difference when Simran was introduced in 1998.  Fans for Simran grew leaps and bounds and from then there was no stopping of non-tamil people entering the industry.  Followed by Simran it was Nagma's sister Jyothika aka Jo, then Reema Sen, Laila, Kiran, and now Chaya Singh, Sonia Agarwal, Bhoomika, Amoha, Pooja...  The list keeps growing... and in that list only a couple of names like Trisha (people say she is Tamil, but she has hard time talking in tamil) and Sneha stand out.  So where are heading towards... My question over here is, are we out of good looking tamil people or are our liking/taste changing?    Comments..  Scribbled by M. Anand

      Game 2 in NBA Finals was not for the weak hearts.  Shaq was brilliant for the defence Pistons showed.  He scored 29 points with both Wallaces troubling him under the ring, but Kobe was outstanding.  He played a brilliant game, not brilliant because he scored 33 points, brilliant because he changed his scoring tactics when he found Prince is not going to let him take those jump shots.  He made some superb layups and loop shots.  And the final three point shot that took the game to overtime, wherewas Price, Hamilton was guarding Kobe.  If Kareem Rush was hero in Timberwolves match then it is Luke Walton for Pistons.  He has excellent ball control, great sense of passing and a good defence which will make Pistons to watch him in Game 3.  Great job young man.    And what on Earth were Pistons doing in the final minute when Shaq was having the ball.  They should have fouled him, instead they let him pass to Kobe.  Again, foul Kobe, let him get two points, you still lead by one.  And of course, Lakers will foul as soon as Pistons get the ball, and it would have been an entirely different ball game.  I am pretty sure Larry Brown is mad with his team for that move they made in the last minute.    Finally as a Laker fan I would like to say they played some real good defence. Go Lakers.  BTW:  Tampa Bay Lighting won the Stanley Cup... let me scribble about that tomorrow.  Scribbled by M.Anand

      Vanisha and Amit are getting married on June 22 in Paris.  For people who dont know who these two people are, here is some info about them.  Vanisha is the only daughter of Mittal a steel business tycoon in London and the fifth richest in Britain.  He is worth 3 billion pounds and he was on news earlier for purchasing the costliest house ever for 70 million pounds.  People all around the world are attending this wedding and two well know celebs from SRK and Aish are also attending this grand function.  The cost of this is estimated to be around 250 crores.   This shows how much Mr Mittal dotes his daughter but instead of spending 250 crores he could have given a salary raise or a bonus for the company people as a marriage present.  He is spending 250 crores on people who already have several crores not knowing how to spend that (He paid Shahrukh 300K pounds to perform in his son's marriage in 1998).  A donation (not all but a part of it ) to India would have been even more better.  Bill Gates founder of Microsoft a born American has donated several crores to India (I dont care if there is any selfish motive in that.  As long as he is doing some good thats fine) I dont know if Mr Mittal has done anything like that.  Well there are two ways of hitting the news: one what Gates did and other what Mittal did, but which one will stay longer?  Only time knows.  Scribbled by M. Anand
