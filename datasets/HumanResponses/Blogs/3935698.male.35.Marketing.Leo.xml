        Here is the first chapter to a book that I've written.  If you would like to read the whole thing, send me an e-mail and I'll send you a pdf.  Also, you will probably be able to tell that it hasn't been edited.  If you would like to help me out and find me an editor, I will give you credit when I'm giving an interview on Hanity and Colmes for the book because it is a NY Times Bestseller!     A Right Wingers Guide to the Radical Left   By:  Jack Hattendorf (A radical right wing extremist that is part of the vast right wing conspiracy and evil right wing attack machine set to rule the world while keeping down all minorities, gays, lesbians, poor people, working Americas, unemployed Americans, illegal alien Americans and giving tax cuts to the rich so they can help me convert all the dumb Americans to my brand of snake handling Christianity and persecuting all that don’t agree with me while supporting companies like Halliburton and Enron or any other company that rapes the environment and takes advantage of the poor American worker by sending jobs over seas, darn it)   I.

Conclusion  Disclaimer:  I refer to leftists, liberals and Democrats with a very broad brush in the following text.  Please keep in mind, this is a generalization not specifically targeted at all leftists (just most of them).  I actually have some good friends that are as far left as you can get, and they actually do, gasp, like me.  Well at least they act like it.  We have lively debates and generally agree to disagree, so Mike don’t get mad at me I still love you but not in a gay manner!!!  Don’t worry, the above was not meant to be some sort of “Politically Correct” statement so liberal’s feelings won’t get hurt.  I just want to make sure you know that I refer to these groups in a variety of ways!  If they don’t want their feelings hurt, they need to put this book down right now and walk away!  I’m a bad ass, and I pull no punches!  I.  Introduction  A quick note before we get started with the first chapter.  My dad is going to retire this summer, and my mother is in the process of sending me many of my high school and before memories.  I was something of a packrat in my younger years, so I got stuff like old notes from family and old girl friends, etc.  Have you ever read notes from old girlfriends?  My daughter will not be allowed to date until she is 25.  One thing that I got, I had completely forgotten about, and I think you may like this story.  As I was going through my box of memories (and wishing I was young again), I stumbled upon a picture holder from an old wallet.  It didn’t have but a couple of things in it, but one of the pictures sent me to the floor with laughter.  In that plastic picture holder was an autographed photo of Richard Nixon!  It was actually a picture that I had cut out of a magazine and autographed myself.  A flood of memories filled my head.  I remember laughing to myself as I cut the picture of ‘ol Dick taking a swing at a golf ball.  I would show it to my friends and proclaim that Dick’s not such a bad dude, he did open up China and all.  Want to make some of your fellow liberal friends mad, just carry around a picture of Nixon.  I looked at the picture again and just smiled.  When I cut this picture out, I was just beginning to walk down the path of adulthood.  I was cocky, and confused at the fact that I knew more than my parents did about life!  I was also beginning to form my opinions about my country and my political ideology.  I would have never thought that in my college years, I would be a leftist, and as I grew and matured even further, I would swing 180 degrees to the right.  Go figure.  I’m going to frame the picture.  It may just be a bad black and white of “Tricky Dick”, but to me it represents a beginning: a beginning of a total political dork, but a beginning none the less.  As you read on, and you think I’m getting to deep or you think I sound like I’ve been smoking crack, think of Nixon (WWND) !  He would want it that way.    Enjoy…  When I was in college, I knew better than most of Americans.  I was a liberal History/Political Science major.  I believed in affirmative action, welfare, etc.  I would go on and on about how these causes where noble and how anyone that didn’t believe the way I did was either wrong or just plain stupid.  I voted for Anne Richards (Democratic Governor of Texas), and I even took place in some political activities at school.  Not many but some.  I was the typical academia liberal.  I was intellectually superior, and my ideas (even though they where not rooted in research or fact) where superior to those right wing thick headed cavemen.  I mean really.  Who was going to stick up for the little guy?  Big business?  Hell no.  The rich?  Let’s hear a real big, Hell no.  The only people that would stick up for these poor folks where people like me.  Arrogant college students that knew more than my parents ever would.  I knew darn well that the right wing would not care.  All they cared about was screwing the little guy and trying to pay fewer taxes.  My PolySci buddies and I would sit in class and discuss how much the world sucked and how could people go on with their lives while so many people where in need.  Around my senior year(s), I think, I began to grow up.  I remember being in the library at Stephen F. Austin State University.  I was reading a book that had been written by an Indian (or Native American, whatever) who had taken the term black power and started an Indian rights group in the 1960’s called “Red Power” (I can’t remember the book, sorry, and I’m not going to waste my time trying to find it).  As I was sitting in my cube, just having woken up from a nap, I began reading a chapter about how he was bitter about the left wing specifically Democrats in government.  “What?” I thought to myself.  “What is this guy thinking???  If it wasn’t for the left wing, the Indians would be on their own without any help from the government!!  Lord knows that they would not be able to take care of themselves!!!”  I had to put the book down for a moment.  I pushed back my chair and began to think hard about the beginning of this chapter.  I had only read the accusation not his reasons, but in my mind how could an Indian (a minority for God’s sake.  Okay okay okay, A NATIVE AMERICAN) make such accusations!  I mean the left, I’m sure, had worked so hard to make sure they where taken care of and protected from the right after they had stolen their land, raped their women, killed their buffalo and destroyed their way of life!  I looked around the floor and for a moment watched dozens of fellow students reading, sleeping and studying in groups speaking in whispered tones.  I guessed that no one else had read the book, or they would be putting a hand on my shoulder and say “Don’t worry dude, they just don’t get it.”  I read on…  The premise about this accusation was the fact that yes it was nice for the offer of help, and it was appreciated; however, when the money came, with it came liberals telling them how to spend it.  To put it in a nut shell, he went on to discuss how Indians where treated like children.  How could they grow as a people if they constantly had people telling them what to do and how to spend their hand-outs.  They would rather go without the hand-outs and determine their own destiny than have a group of outsiders telling them what to do.  These outsiders (liberals) would have no idea about the issues the tribe was confronting, but had preconceived notions about the reservations and Native Americans and that is what they dictated.  It was at that moment that I had a thought of total clarity:  “Maybe I’m wrong?”  “Am I a (oh God) a right winger?”  Whoa let’s take one step at a time.  That chapter in that book made so much sense to me.  I began to re-evaluate my political thinking over the course of several months.  I remember thinking to myself Reagan was a good President, and my professors thought he was the anti-Christ.  I also began thinking about things like welfare and other social programs, and my mind started to slowly change.  “Why did we need the government to do all these things?”  I began to ask myself.  Then the big life changing event – I had to leave the comforting bosom of academia and go get a job.    I worked as a waiter for the first nine months out of the gate.  Basically, it was college North.  Remember this was 1992 and the economy sucked,; the worst in 50 years according to some.  Plus in a liberal fashion, I had no plan for after graduation.  Finally, I began working for Enterprise Rent-A-Car as a manager trainee.  I remember getting my first paycheck in the mail and being so excited!  Then there was an “oh sh—“ when I opened the envelope that had my pay check in it.  Standing in the PO Boxes of my apartment I was stunned.  So stunned in fact, I remember dropping the envelope that my paycheck came in.   “Boy, they take a lot out for taxes.  What is this FICA crap?”  That was the final straw.  My political though began to mature to the right.  I can understand paying my fair share, but this was a bunch of s---.  What am I?  The wealthiest 1%??????  I actually started to open my mind and think.  Listen to what the politicians where saying and more importantly what they where doing.  I began to listen to the news media and how they where slanting stories.  I moved from a protected nilly willy in college to a working American that started to realize that freedom is more important than socialism.  Freedom works.  That is what has made our country so successful!  Over the last several years, I have kept up with my political junkieism. I love to participate in our political system.  I love the debate.  Election night is one of my favorite nights of the year (except 1992 and 1996, but I did like 1994!).  I have shaped my political idealism over this time.  I look back at my college years with some nostalgia.  I mean I did have a great time drinking beer with my fraternity brothers and keeping the debate (as wrong as I was) alive.  Not to mention the chicks!  This is why I’m sitting here at my, well my company’s, lap top right now.  Currently, our country is at war in Iraq.  Being the political junkie that I am, I’ve been watching/listening to the war what seems like 24/7, and I began thinking about all these self important actors and musicians that are protesting not to mention the professional protesters that are screwing up the infrastructures of our major cities.  I keep thinking about my college days when I was always right regardless of the evidence.  Furthermore, I watch these politicians from the left spout out, in my humble opinion, radically un-American rhetoric.    I began thinking about the left.  What makes a person a leftist?  How can an educated person think that way???  I’ve seen the light, why can’t everyone?  But being a right winger, I must respect their freedom to be wrong.  Anyway, that’s why I’m writing this.  To give you an idea of the different types of leftists (think of them as the genus: Liberal  Species: listed below) and how they have evolved, their value system and political thoughts.    This is a very subjective and completely un-scientific analysis of the left.  This is my humble opinion of these groups.  If you are looking for researched or first hand knowledge read any other book that has been written by a professional writer whose job it is to write books.  If book ever sees the light of day, and you buy lots of copies, I promise I will put a lot more time into research for the next book.  I’m writing this in my spare time (and even some time that I can’t spare), so what you see is what you get!  This is simply meant to be some light reading about our buddies on the left.  It should also help you get a better idea about their thought process and keep you from yelling at your TV, radio or newspaper although you will still even when you begin to understand them.  I have broken down the Genus – Liberal into several Species’ including:    •	Academia •	Actors, Athletes, etc. •	Politicians •	60’s Activists •	Gen X •	Corporate •	Unions  •	Minorities(African American’s) •	Tree Huggers  •	Animal Lovers •	Homosexuals •	Hippies •	The Average Leftist Citizen •	The Yellow Dog •	Radical Leftist  •	The French     It is very important that you don’t just use a blanket when discussing our buddies to the left.  Each separate Species has their own agenda and value system.  Now, you have to be careful.  Some of these Species have agendas and values that blend over to each other, but be rest assured these are all very distinct groups.  The common thread is the Genus which I call liberal.  That is kind of a misguided term.  I have been torn as to what to call the Genus.  I thought about “leftist”, “left leaning”, “socialist”, but I think liberal is a good generic term; however, these terms will be interchangeable as we go along (it depends what mood I’m in as I’m writing).    Understanding the Genus liberal is just as important as understanding the wide variety of Species.  I will also be covering this common thread in Chapter II.  Think of this as re-visiting your high school biology class when you had to scientifically describe the specimens that you where assigned by your teacher (who was probably in a union and cared more about trying to avoid testing than teaching) to review.  Think of it as a game.  You could even get some of your right leaning buddies and try and figure out the Species of your friends and famous people.  You may be surprised as you read along who fits where.  Finally, I want to give you some tips on how to handle these folks.  There are some simple tips to help you argue and understand them, so when you read chapter III, look at more as the “rule book” for you to use.  Keep in mind the left usually changes the rules as you go, but more on that later.  I hope you enjoy the rest of this.  I’m writing this before I write the rest of the book.  I don’t know how it is going to turn out (or even if I’m going to finish it!).    II. Genus – Liberal  Okay, let’s talk about the generalities of liberals.  I think the first and foremost thing that you need to know about liberals it this:  They hate you.  Don’t fool yourself.  If you are a right winger, you are stupid, homophobic, racist and are intolerant of anything that does not fit into your radical religiously inspired attitude about life.  You hate the poor.  You hate minorities.  You are also to dumb to realized the peace and prosperity of the Clinton years.  Finally, you are rich.  Now, you may be saying to yourself, “boy Jack, that’s kind of harsh.  I’m not rich, and I believe in freedom.  That belief system keeps me from labeling people.”  Sorry dude, you’re evil.  Your ideas are from Satin herself (well, if God can be female – tit for tat).  The Liberal thinks of you as a cartoon character.  You can see it in all aspects of the media and these idiots when they describe the people on the right.  Here are a couple of the left’s attempt to make people that don’t agree with them look like buffoos:  The Big Southern Dummy:  If you have never noticed the left hates the South.  They have a perception that the south is 1950 Alabama.  I don’t want to get all historical on you, but I have a theory (hmmmm, next book material?): I think this hatred comes from the Civil War.  Let’s take the slavery issue out of it for a minute.  One of the main issue around the Civil War was “States Rights”.  The South believed in a small Federal Government while the North believed in a strong Federal Government.  It is the issue that we have been debating since the founding of our republic.  When the North won the war, the South was devastated economically and socially.  I keep thinking of an old saying “The victor’s write the history”  The North made the South look like a bunch of slave beating crazies that married their cousins.    The little problem with that stereo type of the typical Southerner is that it isn’t true.  The South has gone through great changes in the past 100 years.  Today, the South is as strong if not stronger than the North economically.  The South is growing in population while the North is shrinking, but look how Southerners are portrayed.  The TV show in the early 80’s Dallas is a great example.  The Dallas/Fort Worth area (where I live by the way) is one of the top 5 largest population centers in the United States, but when you watch that show, it looked like a bunch of country bumkins that found oil on their land.  Much like the Beverly Hillbillies.  Hey, I think it’s great.  Let ‘em keep thinking that.  All it will do is keep the Republican’s in power.    Hand Wringing Religious Nut:  This plays into the stereo type of the Southerner, but is also applies to the heartland too.  They look at the lower middle class that is religious as a thorn in their side.  That is why they so vehemently try to keep God out of schools.  With no morals, you make a much better liberal.  I’m always amazed at the glee the liberal will have when they find out that a person that has religion screws up.  As President Bush says, “We are all sinners”  A true Christian realizes that no one is perfect, but we must strive to be the best that we can be.  The liberal on the other hand will take the phrase “Let he who casts the first stone have no sin” to a new level.  In the liberal’s world this means that you can’t criticize anyone for doing anything wrong, and if you do, be prepared.  You will have every second of your past looked into to try and prove that you are a hypocrite.  That is exactly why they try to portray the religious leaders in this world as snake handling crazies.  Think about it.  Even though you are an adult, you want to be accepted.  If you are thought of as a crazy because of your beliefs, you will do one of two things:  1.  Hide it.  and 2.  Boldly try and set the record straight.  Which they will in turn make you look even crazier.  The “I hate the poor” Business Executive:  This one always cracks me up.  They look at everyone that works for corporations (that aren’t part of a union) and thinks they are evil.  Chances are you or someone you know works for a large company.  Think of them when I’m describing how the liberal wants you or your friend to be portrayed.  They think of this person as a cigar smoking overweight person that wears expensive suits and plots the demise of the working class family while gazing upon the picture of his dearly departed grandfather that was in the SS, and he wonders what it would be like to have it so good.  See, the left hates business.  They see big business as trying to screw everyone.  The funny thing about it is they love Starbuck’s coffee.  They will get their copies made at Kinko’s while snacking on Ben and Jerry’s ice cream.  Typical hypocrisy of the left.  Just look it like this.  The typical Volvo driving liberal hates big business as long as it doesn’t inconvenience them, but they will go out of their way to portray them as a bunch of Nazi’s that are bent on killing the planet and enslaving the population.  The Poor Average American that is Duped by the Right’s Mind Control:  This is the average American that tends to not just fall into lock step with the liberal thought control machine.  The liberals hate them because they haven’t yet lost the ability to think for themselves; hence, they must have been taken over by the evil Republican machine.  Now, let’s look at this in perspective.  The news media is controlled by the left.  Hollywood is controlled by the left.  Billions of dollars are spent on news and entertainment is slanted to the left.  I guess I can see how the left would be confused by the fact that the AM radio dial has “brainwashed” so many Americans.   Those are the main three, but don’t worry the left is continually trying to come up with new stereo types to give the right a hard time every day.  Now that you see the left likes to pigeon hole you, I can let you in on the secret why the left hates you so much:  The main problem that you have is you have a belief system.  Be it religious, family values, or simply believing in the Constitution and the rule of law.  See, the left as we know it today is rooted in the 60’s political radicals (who where rooted in FDR more later).  They questioned EVERYTHING.  Hence their “belief system” is no belief system.  Listen to all these musicians and actors wax nostalgic about how they where going to change the world.  Remember the Time cover (I think it was Time) “Is God is Dead?”  If you spend your adult life with throwing away the traditional belief system that had been cultivating for the last 200 years, and you think that everyone that chooses to maintain that belief system is an idiot, you may just be a little bitter too or at lease not steeped in reality.  It makes you even more bitter because you lost (see 1994 Congressional elections and 2000 Presidential elections or Rush Limbaugh or any of a myriad of political talk shows and state/local elections) in the arena of ideas.  Now you are sitting around and you are thinking to yourself that you put the majority of your life trying to change the world into your leftist vision, and you realize that the majority of the American people don’t think the same way you do.  It infuriates the masses don’t see life the way you do – America sucks, right wingers are evil and the military is a bunch of baby killing barbarians!!!    Left wingers will never understand the right for the simple fact that they only hang around other leftists.  Rush has commented on this, and so have many other sources as well.  Here is the jest:  Since the liberal hates the conservative, why would they hang out?  Since they don’t hang out together, the liberal tells his peers how great their ideas are and how they can’t understand why America is going to hell in a hand basket.  How could Bush even come close to being elected?  When everyone I meet at cocktail parties (where we smoke cigars, but you better not smoke a cigarette) voted for Gore?  Another reason that liberals don’t hang around conservatives is they are sore losers.  When the Democrats where in power in the late 60’s and 70’s the Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate would “hang” together (i.e. go to lunch stuff like that)It was nice to have those funny little Republicans spout out about smaller government when they had no say.  Now that they are in the minority, they don’t want to “hang” with those jerks that took power from them!  They would rather plot the demise of the Republicans than get to know them.  Hence, they plot their own demise (which is kind of Oedipus funny if you ask me) because they can’t adapt with the changing times and the overall tone in America.  The Democrats are really pissed that 9-11 happened.  Not for the reasons you are, but because they where starting to see some success beating up on Bush.  Now, he is wildly popular and there is almost nothing they can do about it.   Now keep in mind that people that don’t have the same value system as you do will sometimes try to turn yours around onto you.  Don’t be fooled.  More in Chapter III.  Now that we know they hate us, let’s take a look at some of the common themes you will find with the left:  FDR was God:  There where some before him, but they never really got a foot hold onto the main stream.  FDR enacted the majority of the social programs that are blowing up today.  Social Security, welfare and a wide variety of agencies that have a three letter name.  FRD’s vision was that the Federal Government would be able to help the country out of the depression.  Well, he was wrong.  It took a little attack on our Navy in Hawaii and a war to pull us out, but we where left with the crap that was left behind.    I might be a right winger, but Harry Truman was one of my favorite Presidents.  In reading his biography I remember that he was amazed how un-organized the government was when FRD died.  Here is a valuable lesson about the left – throw a bunch of crap against the wall and see what sticks.  Let the someone else work it out.  Back to my point.  FDR was the root of the 60’s radicals.  Logically, he proved that liberalism doesn’t work, but he is a hero to the left.  I challenge you to find a liberal that will say anything negative about FDR.  I always thought he was one of our best presidents until I began to look at his record.  To say the least, he was a great leader in the early days of the war, but other than that he was not as great as our buddies on the left say he is.  Additionally, he gave a roadmap for two of the bullets in the 60’s radicals arsenal:  1. If they don’t agree with you, change it (see Supreme Court) and 2. Use the courts to change things if Congress won’t.  Today, the left has mastered this.  Why do you think they are fighting Bush’s nominations so much.  Typically, FDR plays a more prominent role for the leftist political groups vs. the, say, tree huggers of the left, but be rest assured he is the foundation for the left’s belief system.  “My viewpoint is right”  I get so enraged when I have a discussion with a leftist.  It is expected that if they make a good point that I concede the point, but if I show that they are wrong, I’m an asshole.    Don’t be discouraged, it is simply a part of life like the sun rises in the East and sets in the West.    The best defense is not to get your feathers ruffled.  If you know you are right and they give you a ration to the point where you can’t stand it anymore, just agree to dis-agree and post their stupid view point on Free Republic.  The USA Sucks.  It varies how we suck.  We ruin the environment.  We exploit poorer countries.  We screw the poor at home and abroad.  It will vary based on the Species, but the theme is common.  The United States somehow is the root of all the problems in the world.    Now, you may be saying to yourself, “Well, let them leave if they don’t like it”  See you are missing the point.  The USA Sucks because you are here.  See how many of these will root back to the hatred of the right.  They don’t hate the country.  In fact, they love it just as long as you are gone.  See, the right doesn’t care about the environment, they hate other countries and the poor should be taken out and shot.  Hey, don’t get your feelings hurt, that is just the way it is.  As far as the left is concerned, the USA is the evil place because of the right.   When you watch the news or listen to anyone that has their face in front of a microphone, listen carefully to what they are saying.  As I said, I’m writing this during the Iraq war.  Some of the questions that are being asked of the President among other Republican leaders are often about how could we be doing this when we are killing so many civilians.    I was watching ABC news the other morning when I was getting ready for work and was absolutely disgusted when I was watching Katie Curric interviewing a General that was in charge of an air base here in the states.  They where getting ready to ship out to the Middle East.  Several basic “how and why” questions where asked, then it came.  Flashed up on the screen was a shot of dead kids and she asked the General “How does it make you feel when you hear of the death of innocent civilians in Iraq?”  I had to do a double take.  Hey you idiot, this poor guy isn’t even over there.  At that point, I decided that ABC news lost a viewer forever.  I would rather watch CNN!    The Military Sucks -  The military is a completely different issue than the country.  The left despises the military.  I’m sure you have heard the “they are our planes now” comment on Rush Limbaugh several times.  As I was driving to the air port tonight, the radio was talking about an asst. professor at Columbia University (3-26-03) said he wanted us to lose the Iraq war and hoped for a hundred more Mogadishu’s.  See, they think the military is the true source of all evil in the world.  Much of that comes from the people that demonstrated the Viet Nam war in the 60’s and 70’s.  They basically held them in contempt.  I can almost hearing the protestors now “I’m dodging the draft, how can they honor their commitment?”  See, it goes back to questioning authority and thinking you are superior to everyone.  The military doesn’t fit.  Furthermore, the leftist believes that we should be able to resolve our conflicts with words.  Look, we may be the enlighten ones, but there are several countries that hate us (usually for the same reason as the liberals do).  We need to have the ability to defend ourselves.  Sorry, I’m probably preaching to the choir.  Basically, the hatred of the military comes from the fact that they hate the country, and want us to get our butts kicked.  Geeks in High School   This is just a personal observation about our buddies on the left.  I see most of them (especially the acting community) as the people that got their butts kicked when they where in High School.  I think that is why they are always preaching political correctness.  It’s not like I was the most popular guy in high school, but I didn’t let it shape my life.  High school was a time in my life that I spend growing into an adult.  Unfortunately, many of the actors in Hollywood didn’t bother to attend college, and their world view was shaped by their experiences in high school.  I’m not saying that you have to go to college to have an educated world view.  I work for one of the smartest people I know, and he never went to college, but he also was able to grow up.  I’m simply saying that it seems that a lot of left leaning folks ended up with some serious emotional scars sometime in their lives (I assume high school).  How do you think we ended up with political correctness?  Don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings.  Heaven forbid someone lose at a sport.  Don’t you think Johnny would feel better about himself if we told him that it is okay to think that 2+2 is 5.  Well, 2+2 may equal 5 on the bizarro world.  In reality, 2+2=4 and I don’t think our children would die if they found that out.  How warped do you have to be to get so offended by a simple comment?  They are always wringing their hands when free speech centers around a nudie bar or throwing crap on a picture of Jesus, but you want to see a riot?  Say that you think it is silly for a guy to dress like a girl (or what ever).  “Well, that’s not free speech that is hate”  Last time I checked, free speech meant you could say what you wanted to.  The only catch is no one had to listen.  Here is an example:  I’m watching TV a few nights ago, and they had a EMINIM album thing on VH1.  About half way through they showed all the protesters whining about how his songs promoted hate waaaaa waaaa waaaa (writers note:  I’m sorry, but this stuff really gets under my collar)  I’ve got a question, where were all these groups when Ice T came out with Cop Killer?  They where defending that as “free speech”, but you hurt their feelings, watch out.  Once again (which could be a common theme thru out this book) they show what kind of hypocrites they are.  Like I said.  Listen to what they have to say.  Several Species in the liberal world got their butts kicked in high school.  Next time you watch CNN and listen to Paul Begalla, listen… “please don’t kick my butt, sir” may be the underlying theme of his arguments.  (Writers note:  well, well, well, it looks like our friends at Crossfire lost their time slot.  Paul and James, I’m sorry to see that you weren’t embraced by your viewers)  Negative Rarely Positive  One thing that is very common throughout the entire leftist movement is they never see anything positive.  From poverty to hunger to racism it is never the strides that people have made.  “We need to do more”, etc.  Well, if any of my left leaning brothers are reading this here is a little news flash, there will always be hunger, poverty and racism in the world.  I’m sorry to say, but we can no more solve the worlds problems in a week than we can take over the world as the left thinks the right wants to do.    I’m always struck on how negative the liberals can be.  If I have to hear how bad things are here in America one more time, I will not be responsible for my actions (of course, if you are liberal when are you responsible for your actions).  I’m an optimist by nature, so when bad things happen to me, I always see the light at the end of the tunnel.  The liberal simply sees an oppressed worker that is digging through the mountain that will never get ahead in life because of the oppression of “The Man”.  How they get through life thinking like that is beyond me.  I’m sure you’ve heard some of the code phrases.  “How can you be so happy when there is so much suffering in the world.”  “Eat all your food, there are starving kids in Ethiopia”  This is just a personal observation.  I’m one guy.  I make a middle class wage, and I’m trying to raise two kids.  I know that there is oppression and starvation all over the world, but I also know my limitations.  I don’t let myself suffer because of something that I have absolutely no control over.  Yes, I will have an opinion, but I don’t lose sleep over the fact that Chechnya’s civil unrest is causing global warming.  As I say, listen to what is said.  They are really just trying to make you feel guilty.  Do they propose to solve the problem with personally taken action?  No, they want to complain about how bad it is.  “Let’s tax the rich and Bill Clinton will fix it.”  Emotional Buttons A major component of the left’s argument is emotion.  Really, how can you be against clean air and water?  Do you really think Bambi should be shot?  Don’t you think we should have peace and love thru out the world?  Don’t those sound good?  Here one to think about:  •	The Founding Fathers never envisioned assault weapons, we need gun control.  Well, I bet the Founding Fathers never envisioned XXX movie theatres either, but you will defend their right to be under free speech!  The left has become very good at wrapping their issues around emotions.  Think of the war the we are currently involved in.  One of the main arguments has been that our children should not go over there to die in this war.  Where were all these folks when we sent troops over to Kosovo?  Well, the difference was who was in office.  See, if our kids go over to die for a fellow leftist it is okay.  The cause must be just.  Here is a dirty little secret (well it’s not that secret) We invaded Kosovo without UN approval (gasp) If you remember it was a NATO gig.  See, the current problems we are having with the anti-war movement is not necessarily the policy, but who is making the policy.  Lip Service to Other Species One thing that has always amazed me about all the Species of liberal is their ability to circle the wagons when times get tough.  See for them it is far worse for the right to have any little victory v. giving up on their specific agenda.  For example:  If Nixon was a Democrat, the party line would have been, “Look, hotel rooms get broken into all the time.  Nothing of note was taken.” Or “Dirty tricks have been a part of politics from the Adams and Jefferson Presidencies.  So they took some papers, it didn’t help the campaign.  What is the big deal?”  See, it isn’t all about sex.  It is more basic than that.  Clinton would have had to walk up to a member of the press corps. and kicked him in the nuts for them to say it was wrong.  I would also guarantee you that there would be some on the left that would argue that he has every right as an American to kick that guy in the nuts.  It all ties back to the basic premise that they hate the right.  It doesn’t matter if you have to make a deal with the devil.  Take a look at the Democratic party and their factions (what we call Species here).  Do you really think that the labor unions give a flip about whether the yellow bellied swallow gets to live in its natural habitat?  Heck no.  Do you really think that the Gay / Lesbian crowd really cares that Buba in local 231 gets his $.02 raise to cover the cost of cigarettes.  Heck no.  It almost becomes a fun game.  Listening to the various groups and how they would react in other liberal circles.  An actor in a steel mill, a liberal anti-business college professor working with the CEO of Loral, you could spend some good quality time thinking of wacky side by side’s.    So, you right winger, you should feel proud.  If it wasn’t for us, the political landscape of America would be like Isreal with hundreds of little parties.  The left views you as their common enemy (for even wider reasons), and they will continue to hug and kiss and say it was just about sex as long as we are around.  Control As I say several times.  Listen.  You can hear what they are trying to say under the BS.  All you have to do is open up your ears.  There are more things that hold our buddies on the left in common, but I think this is one of the most prolific.  The left wants to tell you what to do.  Let’s look at a couple of examples that will help make this a little clearer.  Cigarettes are evil today.  We are fast getting to the point where we won’t be able to smoke in our own homes if it is Tuesday before an election because the nicotine could affect your vote.  I mean it is ridiculous.  Last time we checked we where adults here.  Everyone know smoking is bad, then why is it they are taxing the crap out of cigarettes to try and get you not to buy them?  Two reasons: 1. They know that you won’t complain about the taxes (classic sin tax) and 2. They are trying to control you socially.  They just passed a law here in Dallas that is basically a smoking ban in all restaurants.  Isn’t it the prerogative of the store owner to proclaim in he/she would like to allow smoking in their establishment?  Think about it for a minute.  If non-smoking facilities made more money for the owners, don’t you think EVERYONE would be switching to non-smoking?  Well, since it isn’t the government is telling us what we should do.  One of my favorite examples is seat belts.  Yes they save lives.  I don’t dispute that, but it should be my decision if I wear it or not.  I’m not forced to wear a life jacket if I go out on the water, so why am I forced to wear a seatbelt?  Because the liberals are trying to protect us from ourselves.  We are not grown up enough to decide for ourselves whether or not to wear a seat belt.  I can get a ticket for going 20 mph through a school zone without my seatbelt on, but a motorcyclist won’t get a ticket for going the speed limit on the freeway without a helmet (at least here in Texas).  Okay let’s try and figure out the logic of that?  Furthermore, here is a real head scratcher.  Most liberals support assisted suicide saying it is the choice of the patient, but they won’t let me smoke a cigarette and I’ve got to wear my seatbelt?    Liberalism is not about the little guy anymore, it is a movement that feels they need to protect us from ourselves, and what better group of people than them?  The rich in the Democratic party don’t want to have their taxes cut because they have enough money.  Well, you don’t tax money that is in the bank.  They already have it, so they aren’t affected.  I could go on about taxes but here is another example of the controlling attitude.  I got such a kick out of all the gay groups that had such a cow about EMINIM.  Hate speech, bla, bla, bla.  See, if you say anything negative about one of the Species groups of the left, you are evil, hateful, whatever.  You never see the outrage when people make fun of the Libertarians.  Those wacky far right wingers want to get rid of the IRS?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  What a bunch of dopes.  Look at how the religious folks on my side are portrayed?  They are cartoons, but if you treated an African American like that, Jesse Jackson would be knocking on your door with thousands of his paid protesters.  To put it in a nutshell, they are trying to change the very way we think.  Make us think that it is better to let 3 states burn up because it is bad to cut down trees.  Brainwash us into thinking that eating meat is barbaric.  All of this control centers around Big Government.  I get tickled about the left trying to compare the right to the book by George Orwell, 1984.  In their world, 1984 is a dream.  Control of the people to make sure we are all equally miserable is the ultimate goal of the left.  In the right v left chapter, we will discuss this further, but I think it is imperative to touch on this many times.  The left is happy with a government that is growing and slowly taking over aspects of our lives to make sure we are “safe, etc”.  The right is working hard to keep with the vision of our founding fathers.  Limited government and to give all Americans the opportunity to move up by their boot straps  Don’t fall for it.  Keep your mind free.  I hope you now have an idea who we are dealing with here.  Don’t forget that these are the common threads that hold the left particularly the Democratic Party together.  For any movement to be a movement they have to have a commonality.  Their particular agendas may vary, but the base is generally the same.  I would be amazed to see a liberal pronounce that the government should not tell us to do this that or the other.  You will never see a leftist proclaim that the middle and upper class is being overburdened with taxes.  I may have overlooked some commonalities.  If I did, let me know!  I love hearing from like thinkers.  Now that we have the base built, let’s move onto the specifics of these Species.  We will be discussing several Species on the left.  As in this chapter, there will be some common threads that pull them together, but there are some very large differences between the groups.  Don’t be fooled by the rhetoric from the left.  “Our party is about diversity!  That is why we have so many different groups that are a part of the movement”  That is basically a bunch of crap!  They are diverse as long as you hold the common themes listed above to be gospel.
