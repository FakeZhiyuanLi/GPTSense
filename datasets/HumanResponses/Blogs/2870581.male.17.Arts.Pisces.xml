      SO much FUN.  Okay, now that I'm not totally fucked up, go  urlLink here  to get my scoop, so I don't have to type a bunch of stuff over again.  It's somewhere in that entry, under crap about church and all.  So...yeah.  I love my friends.  I want to go to the park now.  Dammit, I don't have anyone to go with.  No one is online.  -zr/k

      I woke up this morning to a small hangover for over consumption of chocolate and other great things. Hopefully my Birthday Bash will be as great as that one!    "Do you like your coffee like your men?  Dark and strong?" "No...white and sweet."    "I am so FUCKED up!"  "What's wrong Mary?" "She doesn't like fleshy things" "COVER UP THE CHICKEN!  AAARRRGGHHHHH"  *watches Karyn zip around the kitchen with dirty plates while I stuff my face with chocolate strawberries and bananas*  Ahh...yes...random quotes and actions.

      OMG. My party was the bomb. I have never had a party quite like that ever. I have had a few awesome Halloween parties, but never an awesome birthday party. My 15th we had fondue, but it was really nothing, no dancing or anything. My 16th we had my party in a garage. And it's always been really cold. But anyways this party was so freaking awesome. Everybody really enjoyed themselves and we just totally rocked. There was the movie, h'ors de orvres, a little tapenade with crackers, and shrimp sushi rolls, which Jessica managed to down 3 of them. Then there was the cheese that took forever to boil, and Mary being afraid of the chicken flesh, and the grape juice toast, and Karyn staring at the Disaronno Amaretto, and the cooking, and all of the chocolate in it's most luxurious power...Spilling on Katie. Then there was Cranium, the order of these things is not correct. Then the rave, the rave hmmm.... what can we say. Loud blaring music, fog, lights, room spinning, people falling playing with Karyn's car, what a rush, then sitting on the back deck, so we didn't hyperventilate then well it was before, Karyn drinking a mug of espresso. And the infamous "The 7 Hour Movie" lots of laughs. I really wish the people that were here tonight could have been in some of the scenes of the movie. Good times galore. On a scale of 1-10, last night was like a 15. It was so great. Actually the last past two weeks have been the best this year. Hopefully summer brings us more trips to Manhattan, the lake, and the mountains, or perhaps the beach. I miss the Florida Keys...Esp. for some weird reason, I miss Lake Surprise, so mysterious, so beautiful, I love Key West. This day will go down in Ben history. Spontaneous Prose literally played out through us. Well maybe more on Karyn. So many good times.

      KARYN!!!  Go to the DUNGEON!!!  *hilarity ensues*  Oh my god, today was so fun.  So fucking fun.  So goddamn fucking fun.  I haven't laughed this hard in so long, it isn't funny.  Let it suffice to say that Ben and I had a great time.  No, not like that, you perverts.  Although, if someone else had said that, I would have thought the same thing.  But yeah, hilarious little cousin.  Great stuff.  Good times.  I'm just not coherent enough to really write much else, now.  I'll go.  I'll quit hogging flipper.  -zr/k

      I've noticed that, even though I'm not the person who actually started this blog (although I have administrative powers...so I can wipe you ALL out...HAHAHAHA), I have quickly become a total posting whore.  See what I mean?  Hmmm...I should probably fill this with some random, off-the-top-of-my-head poetry.  But my brain is too shot to put anything coherent together.  Oh, wait, I never write anything coherent anyhow.  Silly me!    blargh   eat snails pissing curtains on potatoes green slime gleaning information on white couches in the bronx pissed off chihuahuas licking enormous elephant kneecaps and fucking pixies sticks of stones and letter boxes wooden benches desk flowers power intel inside pentium processors fuck the fucking fucker and his fucking shit uoy knaht   (pans pans pans)   That was refreshing.  I think I'll go shower and sleep now...or something.  Look forward to Karyn totally whoring the blog again tomorrow.  Also look forward to her whoring her LiveJournal.  Because that's what she does best.  Along with addressing herself in the third person.  -zr/k

      I forgot to post this on here:   HAPPY FUCKING BIRTHDAY BEN.   I'm not kidding, I really will make that card.  Sometime.  Maybe I'll draw you another psychedelic mushroom.  Or maybe I'll commit a sin and remove that page from Flipper v2.0 and give that to you instead.  But anyway, have fun being seventeen.  Too bad you can't do anything special that year.  At 13, you're a teenager.  At 14, you get a work license.  At 15, you get your permit, at 16 you get your driver's license.  At 18, you're legally an adult (go me!).  But you're 17.  Sucks to be you, man.  Heh heh heh.  I really don't hate you that much, I promise.  :P  -zr/k

      Well, I've already said pretty much the same stuff in my LJ, but I'll post here, as well.  This blog just needs some LUV.  The lake was very sexy, with its brown water and deformed ducks, split into factions and cults.  Talking was great.  Giving ducks sugar and caffiene was also great.  I was going to throw a cigarette this one duck that was stalking us, but then I thought about what a waste that would be.  Anyway, I want to go back and do it again, because I feel really great right now.  I might just drive out there on my own one day, on a whim.  Who knows?  Okay, I guess I should post my poem about the Loch Ness monster that I wrote today, since NO ONE ELSE IS ACTUALLY WRITING ANYTHING.  What?   Random Serial Experiment #38,298,274 Narcissism  (Leprechauns and Methodone)   Nessie is big and green Blue, purple, red, yellow, and blue Fucking colors Her head is above the water Until she goes down again Go down Go down on the water Go down on the water again and again Until you get hooked on smack And start singing Funkytown Until you drown      I'm so high, I have no idea what's going on  (snap snap snap)    Sooo...I'll probably be doing another Loch Ness monster thing sometime soon.  Tune in for the next random serial experiment.  (By the way, don't take anything I write seriously.  I mean, I figure most people won't, and I'm totally insulting your intelligence by having to add this, but some people actually don't get the humor.  Hell, I don't even get my humor sometimes.)  -zr

Maybe tonight I will clean my room in preparation for the upcoming Fonduish-Rave. One things for definite sure...I have to edit the movie and format it, and burn it. Yes that's o-so-good, because its yet another reason to be on the computer, instead of sitting at home doing laundry or what not. Well I will write more later, after Karyn and I go to the lake. Go Lake!

      Joints are fun to roll.  Even if it's just clover and toilet paper.  This isn't completely pointless, though (damn!), because I was just going to let you know that I fixed the time, since we're very obviously not in California.  I also did some tweaking with the links list and archive title, if that isn't already apparent.  Now, you may carry on.  -zr

      Here it goes. First a little history of The Flipper Books. Ben first made the inaugral Flipper Version 1 way back in 2000. Since then we have moved onward into Flipper v2, which is still in progress. We (members of the order of the Flipper) need a vent to get at even when we aren't in possesion of the Flipper Book. This is that vent. Marvelous. You can jump to the Flipper's founder's page  urlLink HERE . Good luck fellow members of the Flipper. And Godspeed!

      And now, time for Ben's interpretation of the BBQ thing.  If the structure is shitty, too bad, I'm just typing it the way he wrote it. :P  EDIT:  I apologize in advance.  I typed this the way it was written - I think Ben was on drugs that caused him to lose his grip on the English language when he did it.  Just to forewarn you.   The 3 Straight Guys and the BBQ   One day in a quaint Southern town, there lived three straight guys.  They were finally out of college and decided to make a family for their own.  The first straight guy - Bill, always wanted to build his house out of logs, so he started working.  Now, on to a little folklore.  The village was composed of 100% conservative Southern Baptists.  And a long time ago, a gypsy came to town.  He was a strange man by the name of Margo.  Well, the town disowned Margo because they found out that he was gay.  And the town thought it was over with Margo until one day.  One hot summer day, while the townsmen sat on their porches and drank their lemonade, Margo stormed into town and redecorated the town hall in bright magenta and lavender.  Well, that wasn't all Margo did, he also took the mayor - who everyone thought was an all-American father - on for a little one-on-one at the school's gym.  They mayor later hanged himself with an electrical cord off the clocktower with a suicide note that read:  Margo the foolish faggot touched my penis and I liked it.  Now God HATES ME!!!  No reason to live.   Ever since then, Margo has been the villian of the small town and has been known to turn straight men into flaming fags.  Anyway, back to Bill.  Bill is a an of 25, with short brown hair and a medium build.  He toiled for months working on his log cabin.  The whole time, Margo sat in his fag-pad watching Bill.  He watched with great anticipation, he enjoyed the way that the sleeveless flannel shirt clung to his body and how graceful he was as he chopped the wood.  Finally, Bill finished his house.  He went into town to get some gals to break his new bed in when he saw his brother Dan.  Dan had just built a house of his own, made out of pure steel; a further representation of himself.  Dan was almost exactly like his brother, except Bill had darker skin and wasn't quite as big as Dan was.  But Bill put off his little adventure to go out with his brother.  They went to a local bar called "STR8 BEER".  They had an enjoyable time.  Meanwhile, Margo snuck into Bill's house and made what, to him, was "a fabuluous new stallion", Dan and Bill's youngest brother, Evan.  Evan was different from all his other brothers.  Evan was young, wild, and more liberal.  He had jet black short hair with dark olive-toned skin and a build that was bigger than Bill's - not as big as Dan's, yet sculpted perfectly.  Margo stared at the pictures with amazed eyes.  He watched films of when the boys were in college and now had the passion for Evan.  Evan was a body-builder and had several good photos.  One picture Margo went crazy over.  It was a picture of Evan and it showed the soft skin and blendings of the shadows into Evan's developed chest.  Margo spoke aloud, "Black and white makes everyone sexy, but my god!".  Margo went crazy.  Just then, the telephone rang.  It was Evan!  "Hey, this is Evan, um, I'm having a hellacious party at my new glass house - well, it's a loft.  But come over, I got the girls, you got the booze!"  Margo listened to the soft yet equally masculine voice.  "I live at 1800 Glass House Rd."   Hmmm... , thought Margo.  "Hope to see you soon!"  "Hope to see you as well," said Margo, and then Margo set off to meet the new passion - Evan.  He pulled up to the loft and paged Evan's place.  "Hey Evan, let me up!  I'm the Big Bad Queer and if you don't, I'll huff and puff and poof - you'll be gay!"  There was a brief pause.  "Man, I"m already bi - come on up, you don't have to ask."  So Margo went up.  Evan came to the door wearing a police uniform.  "Who are you again?"  "I'm the Big Bad Queer, but you can call me Margo."  "Margo, you like cops?"  "The Show?  No, I hate it, it's tasteless garbage!"  "No you fag - the thing -" Evan moved closer to Margo, "- the body."  Margo screamed out, "Dammit, you're hot, but I'm the aggressive one."  Just then, Evan's bevy of girls came around the edge.  "Are you going to arrest me officer, or can we work this out?" said a short blonde gal.  Evan went to the girl and grabbed her J-Lo inspired booty and stared into her eyes.  "Maybe, what are you willing to do?"  Margo interrupted, "hell no!  I thought I knew you Evan.  But obviously you're not the man I thought you were.  She has split ends and needs a manicure, not to mention a facial!  I won't spend the rest of my AIDS-free life with a sleazy man like you, even if you do look great in that uniform!  I thought you had style, I thought you had taste."  Evan replied, "no, i just like to get screwed."  "Well, it's over!" exclaimed Margo.  "So over!"  Margo stormed out onto the streets where he immediately became happy again when he remembered Bill and Dan.  Plus, there was a huge sale sign up at the Armani store across the street.  Margo was happy again.  After his shopping spree, he headed back to the country to get Bill and Dan.  He arrived at Bill's house.  Bill sat in his chair.  Margo peer through the windows.  Bill got up and went to his basement to work out.  Margo ran around and looked through the sliding glass doors at Bill's basement.  Bill commenced to lifting his set of weights when Margo yelled out with his feminine voice, "Bill, I'm the Big Bad Queer, and if you don't let me in - to redecorate your god-awful house, I'll huff and I'll puff and poof - you'll be gay!"  Bill dropped the weights.  He yelled, "I just got done with my house, and I'm not about to let some queer come in here and take my deer off my walls!  And you can't make me gay!  I'm straighter than a flag pole!"  "Well, I'll just have to melt your flag pole into a fag pole you - stud, you!"  Bill took out of the front door to Dan's house and when Margo got there, Dan had just slammed the door.   Two men , Margo thought, then he exclaimed, "you all better let me in your metal shack so I can do some painting and give you all a facial, or I'll huff and I'll puff and poof - you'll be gay!"  "Aaah!" the men yelled.  And they took off to Evan's new house.  However, since Margo had already been there, he beat them there and went to Evan's loft.  He went in and Evan said, "I got to thinking and you're right, I'm a whore!"  "No talk now, my love, your hillbilly brothers are headed this way!"  And just then, they burst in Evan's door.  "Oh no, you silly faggot, you turned our brother gay!  Nooooo!!!!"  "Chill out guys, I've been liking guys - I'm bisexual."  "It can't be!"  "It is.  And it's not so bad, really."  Then Margo and Evan formed them into a corner and well - poor straight guys.  Margo turned them all gay and they lived fabulously ever after.  The end.

      The girl walked down the street, purposefully yet aimlessly at the same time.  Everything seemed so bright and so focused that it hurt.  It made her brain become a jumbled mass of sensory information.  The bricks of the buildings, corners worn smooth by time and weather, faded and torn posters mounted on storefronts and telephone poles, panhandlers in their masses of stinking rags asking for money from shadowed doorways.  Signs attempted to entice her to try this psychic, buy that incense or those flowers, check out the latest and greatest adult video.  Still, she walked onward, hands deep in the pockets of a ratty old hand-me-down jacket, sneakers thumping on the concrete sidewalk with each resolute step.  The slight breeze ruffled her dark, blondish hair, and the bright sun forced her to don a pair of old, scratched sunglasses.  She couldn't remember where she had bought them, or if she had even bought them in the first place.  Squinting, she noticed a bus coming down the relatively empty road, but she kept walking.  A random man had tried to hassle her a little bit, and she could feel her right eyebrow twitch, a familiar nervous tic.  It usually just occurred when she was getting annoyed.  She told him to piss off, so he did and she kept walking.  One of her frayed, graying shoelaces loosened and untied.  Now, with each step, it was  flip  to the left,  flop  to the right.  The renegade lace would find itself in dangerous positions that could potentially cause her to trip with each step, but it would find its way back out again every second.  She couldn't stop to complete such a trivial task as tying a shoelace.  It would only come undone again after about five minutes of walking.  Ten minutes passed, twenty, and the lone traveler still strode on, almost defiantly.  The ugly stone buildings and cracking sidewalks soon gave way to more rural settings.  Soon, she walked in weeds that grew waist-high on the side of a dirt road, but her pace didn't falter.  Past this farm, past that two-pump filling station, past those woods.  The road continued, and the girl went with it.  She didn't care where it would take her, she just had to keep walking.

      Wow, poor Flipper is being neglected in the worst way possible.  Not only this version, but the notebook version as well.  Maybe we're all experiencing one huge, collective creative block.  Maybe there's something in the water affecting us.  Or maybe we're just worn out from all the fun of the past weekend (Guster, fondue, etc etc etc).  So...just to break the monotony, I'll whore my playlist here.  Hey, I do it everywhere else.  I'm trying to expand my musical horizons, though, so expect it to change and be re-posted later, after I add new things.   urlLink here   And, I'm out.  Again.  -zr/k

      Okay Karyn reminds me of Michael Jackson, because she wants to be white but her hands are black. Can we say...Bleach??? No we really had a lot of fun with the tie dye shirts and they are going to be sooooooo good. But in the process of all this Karyn has made herself look like a serial killer, instead of a serial poet, with the red dye splashing everywhere...Representing blood...I guess. It just looked wired.

      Joint story by Ben and Karyn here.  Because we're sexy bitches.  Or bastards.  Or whatever.    Once Upon a Time in Sweden   So once upon a time in Sweden, there were two girls.  And they were so morose.  It was pathetic.  They sat around all day waiting for something totally novel to happen.  The oldest sister, Helga, said to her youngest sister, Igne, "Vaht shall vee doo today Igne?"  Igne replied, "I doon't know Helga, maybe vee shall goo and skip in the meadows!"  "Good idea!  Let us goo!"  And so they went.  Off to the fields of Öland. where the wildflowers grew and embellished the countryside.  They ran and danced in the emollient atmosphere.  But it didn't make them feel better.  They decided to take an adventure to somewhere remot, somewhere isolated.  They jumped in their Volvo and took a few Euros from their money jar and went off.  They decided to luxuriate themselves and spend the weekend at the Ice Hotel in nearby Jukkasjârvi.  When they arrive they were greeted and assigned their rooms.  "How awesome, zis place iz sach a total astute idea!" said Igne.  However, Helga was filled with trepidation.  Thought theaspect of sleeping on reindeer skin in a room made of ice seems futile and uncivilized, it was surprisingly very modern and sleek.  The girls enjoyed their visit, and when they got home, their mother was very angry.  "Vhere have you gerls been?" said their capricious mother.  "Mother, vee vent to zee Ice Hotel, that iz all."  "Vell, you all have vork to do!"  So their mother punished them by making them clean the reindeer stalls and gather the berries in the fields.  So they finished their incumbent chores and finally fell asleep.  Early in the morning, the girls awoke to hear their mother on another drunken rampage.  She had loaded herself with vodka and was yelling at her husband, Yussaf.  "Yussaf, zoo are sach an idiot!" exclaimed the evil mother.  Helga went into the kitchen where the fighting was going on.  "Mother, quit condescending Yussaf, he iz jast trying to tell you that you are an alcoholic!"  "I am no alcoholic!"  "Yah, you are!"  The dispute went on until finally, Helga grabbed her sister and Yussaf and set the house ablaze.  They jumped in their Volvo and headed for the horizon.  The mother, frenetic in what her family had done, took off after them in her Saab.  So there. It was the maelstrom of a car race.  Right down the road.  The battle of the Scandanavian cars. Nobody really knows why it was a race or anything.  But they decided to keep going.  Helga screamed out of the window, "Zah first one to Denmahrk vins dah race!"  And then, out in the middle of the vast land of evergreen trees, came an ugly mØØse and an even uglier Mercedes-Benz.  Helga safely doged the mØØse and the Mercedes, as her mother in her Saab ended up with a mØØse in her windshield.  The car exploded, and since their mother was so loaded with alcohol, she burst into flames and died instantaneously.  Helga, Igne, and Yussaf, seeing the flames, breathed a collective sigh of relief, and they decided to go to Denmark anyway.  "She vahz sach an alcoholic!  I am glad she eez goone!"  Yussaf exclaimed.  Igne wept, because she had loved her mother.  She had provided her with alcohol, and now she had no way to fuel her alcoholism.  Helga slapped her around a bit, and she dried her tears, vowing to never forget the woman who had bought her her first bottles of vodka and rum. Further down the road, they saw the tunnel coming up that would take them to Denmark.  Before they could enter it, though, it sprung a leak and filled full of water.  Water gushed up into the road leading to the tunnel, submerging all of the cars, including that Swedish brick, the Volvo.  Helga grabbed a bottle of vodka from the glove box and downed the entire thing in a gulp, before they all drowned.  No one around saw a ghastly, corpse-like figure running from the scene, back to a burned-up Saab.  No one but Igne, that is.  But she wouldn't live to tell about it.    So...the part before the break is his, the part after is mine.  No good, but my brain is fried.  -zr/k

       Alright I have heard all I can stand about me not writing in Flipper. So here I am writing on the Blog that I started. And well in general I really don't think that there is all that much interesting other than what I posted on my site. But now I am so craving (along with the Perrier Mineral Water with Natural Lime Flavor) a freaking Red Bull. I need to buy one for tomorrow. I don't think that many people are in full comprehension of what Red Bull means to me. See, I am at this point anti-American and pro-European. So I support the Euro economy by buying Swedish Volvos and Swedish Volvo parts, buying expensive Evian water from Switzerland, expensive French Perrier mineral water, and buying expensive Swiss Red Bull energy drinks. I guess Swedish Fish are Swedish, I think... But anyways. The quality of things in Europe is so much higher than that of American products. Because Europeans aren't as engrossed with profit, as us Americans are. But I am open to trying things from America...That have been imported.

      Some people just need to write. Today I am feeling very...Intelligent. As in I am understanding and comprehending so much, I know that I will short circuit sometime tomorrow or this weekend. Karyn's graduation party is Saturday and I am really looking forward to getting to see everyone again. For those of you who haven't read Ben's Blog, otherwise known as "LaVieDeBen" or in English "The Life Of Ben", I have been reduced to nothing now that all of my friends are gone, well not really nothing, I am still really cool, and well, yeah. But it's tragic to see your friends leave. Thank god they are not dead or anything.

      Two silly poems from the trip that Anne-Rae and I took to Four Seasons Town Centre    Untitled     &nbsp;  If I were a janitor sweeping the decay of life  Then I would be black  And go by the name of Rosie  We can do it girls  The perpetual perm  The rolled-up sleeves  The emphysema  And the arthritic knee  A broken lifesaver, a dust bunny, and a key into another world     &nbsp;   Oh to be a Fly on a Moldy Piece of Bread   &nbsp;  Oh to be a fly on a moldy piece of bread  Dodging plastic implements of death  Dodging the sharp point of the world  And the Venus flytraps  Lighting on the decaying walls of society  Oh to be a fly on a moldy piece of bread  Break dancing to the beat of the world  Break dancing to the beat of your fading heart  Spinning slowly into oblivion

      So I had this really weird dream last night and I was so out of it! It was about me getting the death sentence for something I didn't do. In this dream it was killing all these people. So I got the sentence of death by electrocution. And I had this really nifty cool speech about how capital punishment serves no purpose and how it is not really justice prevailing, it is just a continuation of the days of the guillotine, and the gallows. So then the bastards wouldn't even let me hold my rosary beads. And I died, and then I was this spirit and I floated over and saw my family and all that stuff, and then I woke up. I wish my dream could have extended further. Because maybe then later I would have been denounced a saint or something cool like that.

      Alrighty, hello and welcome. I feel like a lump of shit right now. I just get so emotional. Like what the hell is up with me? Anyways, I am feeling all emo because of the age-old thing that always make me sad. When people have to go home. I know this sounds so  over-rated and stupid, but I cannot wait until I find someone to move in with, like me. Because then it will be like a sleepover that never ends. The oven finally finished cleaning itself. After only what...2 hours? But anyways I hate when people have to go home. It's like "well it's all over now get the fuck on with your life." But I am looking forward to the Guster concert this Saturday hey it's Sunday now so we only have 6 MORE DAYS!!! And some people pissed me off today, but it doesn't really matter, because I really don't know who they are. I hate living in the south. The land of biased opinions and such. Progress has continued on the picture wall, as well as a new segment in my room called the "places" wall. Which is a wallpaper for the whole modern art thing I made with Karyn today. It's our phase of "deconstructively constructive". Noises scare me. I have my shoes in the dryer and I feel like someone is outside walking on the front porch, and I am really to afraid to go and look. Hold on because this is pissing me off. Okay, there's nothing there. Although I was reluctant to look, there was nothing except for the one love in my life asleep in the driveway. Really, I think I am an anti-sexual. I really don't have any romantically passionate feelings about anyone, or anything, except for my car (in a joking matter) (I am not like one of these 17 year old kids who got some Mexican girl pregnant and won't help raise the kid, and spends all their money on their Honda.) (First of all I drive a Volvo, so that means that I have some deal of class. Second, I won't put any "phat" radio system in my car, because it doesn't match me. I like to listen to music. But the only real music I can listen to really loud are usually classical tunes. And that's only when I am mad) Don't get me wrong I would love to do some things to my car to get her interior and exterior back to their original shape, but I have to worry about getting to college, and plus I did mention that my car is a Volvo, so then I really don't need to worry about fixing her up at all, as long as she runs. But back to me being an anti-sexual. I really haven't ever felt truly passionate about anyone except for the few people I didn't get a real good chance to put through my wonderful evaluation process. But it's all over in like a month and I realize that it wasn't a need of a mate, but attention. I am so starving in attention. And maybe it really isn't attention I need but someone who can help me figure myself out. Like someone who (((entering Ben's fantasy land))) will enjoy just lying on the sand dunes at night and talking until the sun comes up. Someone who is simple and low-maintenance. (I consider myself low-maintenance, but who am I to judge myself?) Someone who just doesn't need any refining to get to my level of comprehension. Maybe one day I will find someone or... Dare I say...Something. But until then, I remain the same old me. I just want summer to hurry up. I hate winter, I mean I like it, it's okay, but my favorite season is summer. It makes everyone so active. That's what I need. Either I need to go to camp this year and meet some old friends, and make new ones, or I need to make several trips into the wilderness with my friends.  Something just has to be done. I can't sit around all of my life and analyze myself, and see if I am meeting my standards. I need to like...Break off of this "track" I am on and just go with the flow. Dammit I am so tired. Well as I sit here yawning, I will have to leave until later, where I hopefully won't neglect blogging, because I know you guys like to see what I am thinking.

      It's time to burn. Okay. This blog is for Danielle. Now I am not much for going behind people's backs and saying anything about them, but this incident today really pissed me off. Okay there's Danielle. Imagine her as a typical 5'3'' Dixie girl with long stringy and sometimes tangly dark brown hair. (That could symbolize shit in this example) Her face is one that looks really good on one of those Lifetime movies, where the mom has like 32847 kids with some Mexican named Pedro. Then she is skinnier than me! And she makes it a point to tell everyone that she really isn't anorexic, which, she probably isn't. Her family just never has enough food to feed her. Either that or she has tapeworms. But anyways back to me. So she sat next to me one day like last month or so and wanted to know if I was going to prom. Of course I was! And then she proceeded to tell me about how her dad can't pay for her to go, and she won't be able to attend. Me, I'm like "Oh really, well that sucks." So then she said "Wouldn't it be cool to go together?" "Sure", out of the kindness of my heart, not to be rude or anything. FAST FORWARD ONE WEEK. By now she has called my mom, and arranged for me to pay for her to go and everything! I don't have any problem paying for my date to go to the prom but: A) She's not my date. B) She has no taste in dresses, in order to look so-good or anything. C) I had already told Becca that we were going together. FAST FORWARD ANOTHER WEEK LATER- She's all up on Mary's brother, Gary. So I was slightly relieved to know that maybe I wouldn't have to go with her.  FAST FORWARD TO TODAY- She usually sits outside and gives me like her cookie or yams, because I don't eat lunch, but occasionally food is appealing, even if it is from East Davidson Cafeteria/Crematorium. And today she sat with her super ultra lover and they were so talking about me. Like I wasn't even fucking sitting across the picnic area, and loudly, so she could boast and all about how she is so sexy or whatever. But then she sang. It was hideous. Like someone had stabbed a dying martyr and those were her last words. Plus it was like so nasal, I thought that she was going to get a nosebleed. Well that's it...that's why BEN is mad!

      So Good. It's a great day. I have thoroughly enjoyed my birthday so far. Going to the lake today after school. Cool. And I am also really looking forward to my party. Oodles of Poodles. More randomness. Yet more to come. I totally forgot about my make-up lessons for violin this week. Haha! But I go again today, unfortunately. I really wanted to stay longer @ the lake. But busy busy me. I got sound on my computer finally. (((Go Ben!)))

      Okay. I have had it. The little separations in lunch have driven me outside to seek refuge from the upcoming world war. This has noting to do with me. And I'm staying neutral. I think that both oppositions are wonderfully intelligent people, but they are really clawing at each other, and I don't want to be there. So I won't. Outside! Outside! But moving on, I didn't know that I could even access this page from school, so know I found a new fun thing to do during third period. Joy!!! I started working on our chemistry project today and it is o-so-awesome. It's about the atomic theory...how lame...yet our group makes it interesting. It's going to take some time for this thing to get edited because everyone keeps messing up, but I can't blame them...it's too crazy. And I have to work on French. Because the teacher came up to me and told me that I have an 81 or something. Well that's cool by me, because I am somewhat more prepared for the upcoming test on passe compose. Like you guys really know what it is. Man. I need to get my new car soon. I really enjoy the one I have now but things are driving me crazy. Like the cracked reflector. The ghetto radio. The the torn speaker, et cetera. I am just so anal retentive, it's scary. I have to clean up the house and all for my party. And go over this here study guide. Bye guys!

      So I have this book coined with the term Flipper through the infamous journal entries of Kurt Cobain. And I write in it all the time. There's Flipper V1 and V2. V1 is the typical stuff that I would write previous to my Blog experience. V2 is a community effort in that everybody writes in it. And hopefully LaVieDeBen won't interfere with my writing output. But anynah, I believe that our next culture club meeting could possibly be my birthday party, in which I will bw planning all into next week. Karyn has already gotten me my gift--Guster tickets! Freaking awesome. If you don't know Guster check them out--> urlLink GUSTER  And we got a new dog. So preciousss. Her name is Bailey, and she's a boxer-lab mix. Fun Fun Fum!

      The life of Becca: I work, I play, I work some more and now life as I know it has ended. Once upon a time, there was a child named Tabitha and she called me fat, and I am so not fatter than her, so she ended up dying of tuberculosis. The end.

      L'ok, ainsi moi et mes amis sont ainsi allant à ce CONCERT de GUSTER prochain, ET CE VA ÊTRE AINSI AMUSEMENT! Nous attendons avec intérêt ceci. Guster est notre version de la version des années '90 du Nirvâna. Mais était de toute façon aujourd'hui le vendredi mauvais le treizième. Bizarre bizarre! Der Bleistift ist Spaß. Enterichtlinie. Mein hund kratzt auf meinem auge. J'ai juste voulu être violent et parler allemand ici.

      Yeah. Life goes on. But I don't want to do anything except for sleep. I have to get the house cleaned because since my parents aren't here, as well as my sister, it gives me time to organize. The way to my heart is through functionality, organization, and style. Which explains many things about myself. The reason I am in love with my car (functionality). The reason I sometimes am anal retentive and meticulous (organization). And why I want to be an interior designer (style). SO IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW DISPLAYS THESE SKILLS THEN PLEASE CALL: 1-800-TAKE BEN. Enough. I am so tired of people telling me that my goals are too high and that I won't achieve everything I want. Fuck all of you. I will be everything I am and more in the progressing years. But enough bitching. Orange marmalade. Orange marmalade on toast. Orange marmalade on toast calls Ben to the kitchen. (Ben leaves for kitchen)

      Okay. Breathe in, breathe out. And no I wasn't singing the Bush song. Things are running through my head like a fast salmon racing upstream to spawn again. Well, that isn't all that fast. But like the decay rate of coffee with me around. People are seriously pissing me off. Like um.. Let's see, life in general. It isn't even just one thing. I want to advance to a higher place of living, as in, not this shithole HOUSE here. Drama everywhere. Its like a never-ending saga! But things are brightening up. As when I see the trees blossoming, signaling the rise of the warmer weather and the rise to my trip Denver. It's all free. So good! But anyways. Life is somewhat of an enigmatic thing today. My word usage drops ever so increasingly, I must resort to using large words in places where they don't belong, because I am so very scatter-brained now. UNLEASHING FRUSTRATION: JASD;GLJAE;OIRUT0P34975 49U50OMGWTFBBQ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11ONE :END OF FRUSTRATED MOMENT Do I have unsettled issues, YES Do I feel like driving really far, as in um 60 miles or so to sleep in my Volvo, YES Do I have enough gas to last me there and back, NO When is the next Volvo Party? (because the odometer rolled out another 1000 miles, 121 in excess) NO CLUE Karyn we need a party here, Volga is pissed.  FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN LACK OF KNOWING WHAT I JUST SAID LET ME INFORM YOU. Every mile in my Volvo is one towards the world record against some other guys driving a Volvo in NYC. He is at 2,000,000 something, I however am at 230,000 something. Every 1000 miles gets me closer there. So we throw a party in the 1985 240 Series DL everytime I see 000 on the trip odometer. That's what we do, the last party was on Mardi Gras, in the Wal-Mart parking lot, after our Sinning Feast. Then the next day we went to Ash Wednesday!!! Good times Karyn! LOOKING FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY GAINING 18 DOLLARS TO GO AND SEE GUSTER AGAIN IN WINSTON-SALEM! Then waiting for summer to arriver, so we (friends) can get back out on the lake! This Saturday we are going to Appalachian and it should be so fun! Looking forward to it! I NEED TO GET INTO THE VOLVO HIGH MILEAGE CLUB!

      Okay! Our school's FBLA chapter competed this weekend in Greensboro, and I am very proud of all that competed, you guys are doing something with your life, and you are learning the must-have tactics for success and leadership. Congrats to all that placed and won events. Now a little bit of ego. Jordan, May, and I kicked the ass of North Carolina on our little Powerpoint multimedia presentation! WE WON 1ST PLACE! See yalls asses in Denver. (the site of where we go to compete for Nationals) We met all sorts of people, most notably, a wonderful nouveaux penny-dropper by the name of Summer. Grood. I am sitting here, thinking about my life. Today Rebecca and I went to go and see Cold Mountain at my previous place of employment, the $2.00 theatre, where month-old films are glorified to those who have nothing better to do. Again, Rebecca lays all over other guys, deepening the wound of "Ben Needs A Partner" scenario that is overplayed, oversaid, OVER-ANALYZED!!! Needing to be OVER!!!!! But anyways the movie was really good! I thought it would be a biased form of propaganda for the defeated Confederacy, but it showed the good, and bad sides of both forces, which totally made it worth while for me. It had al all-star cast, good storyline, and awesome cinematography. 4.5 stars! Bitter ending though, but from a quote out of another good movie, Vanilla Sky, "Life isn't as sweet, without the bitter". So then we went to take Becca's friend home, then we went to go eat at Hunan's, the best damn Chinese food EVAHR! Then I came home, and now I sit eating portions of lime-green Jell-O, and doing homework for school tomorrow. Mon devoir de ma classes n'est pas bien, EST MAL!

      Yeah. Its been a deal of time since I have blogged but there isn't much really to say. Other than the fact that the EDHS Poetry Club is in full swing. That's all really, oh and my radiator is leaking or was leaking antifreeze. I didn't want to risk driving it today, even though I really think it was a boil-over, in that I had my car at a high speed and turned it off , without letting it cool down.

      Okay. Guster kicked some serious ass. Without a doubt I will be going to their next show in Winston. But as for this past show, it was remarkable. We waited in line for hours and we stood at will call for a good period of time. Due to the fact that Karyn's tickets didn't show up. This was the best concert I have ever been to. The opening band, whom I cannot remember the name to save my life, was really good, but I wasn't there for them, I was there for Guster. And were they good! Even though I ended up getting my video-camera taken away, because the dumbasses said I couldn't tape the show, I had the best time. It was full of raoming around Charlotte, sitting at the ghetto club and what not. But the best part was getting to see a sold-out Guster show! YES!!!!!

      Yeah! The Guster Countdown is slowly falling out. ONE MORE DAY! And today Karyn and I are off to go and get the ritualistically things for the concert such as Pixy Sitx and Ping-Pong balls. Karyn is obsessed about the Volvo, and her party is tonight. So much fun in one day! The school dance is tonight and I have to work at the thing selling smoothies. Great and Good. Tomorrow is the day!!! I have to go and get a job. I fixed this ugly thing on the Volvo, and this other piece fell off on National Car-Wash day, when I was cleaning it. The AC fuse keeps blowing out, which means windows down, laid back! Summerness is present, as it is only March, and yesterday it was 82 degrees outside! What the heck! So today I am having a wonderful day. It's so great. FRIDAY AT LAST! I feel really random today, but all is good, I drove the Volvo the long way in the country and I enjoyed it.

      Okay, yesterday was national car wash day. Because me and Karyn made it a point to clean the cars. And we did indeed clean the cars. Karyn wants a Volvo so bad, she could piss on herself. Speaking of Volvos, I now have my webpage up and running at  urlLink THIS SITE HERE  So go there and witness the wrath of Ben on anti-Volvo cars.

      Today is going by really well. So far I have all of my homework done. And that means not having to worry about doing it. Now we are in the boring class, and it means work on the computer, work on the computer, work on the computer! But its no big deal because it is so easy. I have a list of things to do today. That consist of: A) Tightening the screws on my windshield wipers, and finding out why one of the cleaners wont spay the stuff out. B) Cleaning the carpets in my car.  C) Extreme clean my car in general. D) Add more music to my music library. It's so amazing, I have kept my room clean since Sunday, I even made my bed everyday. I think it is the almighty power of the holy picture wall, because it is so cool. And I am just so freaking happy, because the Volvo has fuel, I have fuel (thanks to Red Bull) and the Guster concert is in 3 DAYS!!! I just feel that if I have a Red Bull once a day, that I will be so much more smart. I knew everything in Chemistry and it was so great. I got candy for being smart. Its all good. But I just realized that everyone has some type of blog. How awesome.

      So yeah. The news for today consists of the marvelous t-shirts that Karyn and I made for the Guster concert, as well as Karyn's discovery of the best candy in the whole damn world: Swedish Fish. As for me, I am still craving a Red Bull, so you guys should get me one NOW! But other than that, really nothing has been that cool other than today, my friend and I re-enacted all of US History through black and white M&M's. The original purpose was something to do with half-lives in Chemistry, but I really wasn't paying much attention. Now the thing was like we started with all of the white M&M's taking the black ones to America via the "middle passage". The there was slavery, the Civil War, KKK rallies, Black Pather meetings, Malcom X, MLK, and Harriet Tubman, oh wait there was Rosa Parks and the people from the sit-ins. Great stuff, then we covered both of the World Wars, changing the black M&M's to Jews and keeping the white ones as Nazis. Then the Vietnam War, where everybody died, and I think we even got to some recent history with changing the M&M's to Iraqis. So much freaking fun. But I am going now.

      Everyone PLEASE pray for Ben today. It's imperative that you do such (Karyn) because I am driving my mother's disgusting Ford Focus (otherwise known as either the Ford Fuckus, or The Giant Moblie Tampon). So since everybody knows that I almost refuse to drive anything accept Volvo. However the big blue bomber has ran out of gas, and my mother, who said "Ben I am tired, I don't have any money! Go to school or something," left me to take the hideous wagon-wannabe. It has front wheel drive, so I feel like I am riding on a damn rocket. Argh! Curse you Ford!!!! But I hopefully will get home today and refuel the Volvo. (((Rating of Ben's "Pissed Offness" 6, yeah it's that serious to me!)))

      Yeah so here it goes for March 1st 2004. I am so looking forward to the upcoming Guster concert. Go Guster fans!!! And I am looking forward to impressing more people with my skills of cooking fondue at Katie's party. So yeah. Then we move on to the more mellow days; today at lunch. No entertaining unfortunately. But I did notice that the depression was eating away at Danielle. No wait, that's just her wanting to be sexy or something. So anyways moving on and out of the white trash sector or the thing I call life, I am so craving some mineral water. Especially the Perrier brand with natural lime. It's my new version of liquid crack. So here's a note to those who regularly read my blog: BUY BEN SOME MINERAL WATER!

      Good day, Readers of the blog. I am very achy today, due to the fact that I hiked 8 or so miles yesterday at the Hanging Rock State Park. It was really awesome. I almost threw up en route back up the mountain. Also it was our bright idea to NOT bring water on a 80+ degree day. Really dumb. And I forgot to make my lunch as did everyone else. It was brutal. The creek water tasted good though. So I am out of school today because I don't feel good, and also because I didn't do my French dialogue, and also because the cold air blowing at me in the bed this morning lulled me to want to stay home and...clean my room reluctantly.

       urlLink    Swedish Flag, for those who have never seen it. Now the plan goes for a large yellow stripe to go down the middle of the car. From trunk to hood. Then a crossing yellow stripe on the hood. Doesn't it seem awesome. Now for the money to do it. Ah. I have been looking for a job for several weeks. And it always comes up with no success, but I continue aimlessly. As I need money to fix Gotilda, and Volga. Volga just needs cosmetic work as well as new spark plugs and a few washers to  stop the flow of fluids from the oil pan and stuff. Gotilda needs more attention though. A new air filter and random things. Gotilda is a rather awesome car, power front windows are so cool! It has heated seats! I mean YES! The only thing I have heard negative about the car is one thing: GAS MILEAGE, apparently its like a new Explorer. But it is a V-6 and it is a boxy Volvo! As far as parts go, most people say that you can use parts for a 240, because not many 164s were made. Think of it, my very own Swedish Fleet of Volvos! I received the key today. Now I have to get tires and wheels (around $200) and a piece of glass for the quarter window in the back. But it's so worth it. If I get it fixed up, I am going to use it as my "go to town car" so I can display the awesome power!&nbsp; urlLink

Because it involves money...moi...and...Denver. Something about how Mother's lover took all of the money out and now the check that they wrote for my FBLA activities is NSF (hahaha Norway Sweden and Finland, inside joke)!!! So i have to so vent off to someone before I explode, and then I will post it on here like I usually do!!!&nbsp; urlLink

Well now I have to fix this great tragedy that my mother has created by calling Katie's love/hate issue's parents. Ahh! Wanda, the bus driver told me that Katie is going to end up raping him. Which was really funny especially over lunch. Haha!

It's called Tory's Falls and it is 4.2 miles from the lake of Hanging Rock, and more than likely 5 miles from the Visitor's Center. You know, I look back on that day and I remember feeling pissed off because things weren't going on MY way. Like we got lost going there, I spent my alloted money for lunch on a damn map, and there were no vending machines to supply us with refreshing treats and/or water. But I sit here thinking now, that we all had a really good time. The best time for me since the Guster concert, and the best outdoors experience since Crowder's Mountain climbing. We all (I think) learned a lot about each other but most importantly ourselves.It was a beautiful hike, though it was real hot and we had n fluids, except for the occasional creekbed. I hope we all get to go and do that again.&nbsp; urlLink

      Hello! I tried updating the Blog the other day at school but it didn't work! So how is everyone liking the new styled Blog? It's so grand don't you think? Oh well, what I was going to say the other day is that less than a week of school remains and there are NO seniors at the school, well except for the ones that failed, but really all of the other ones are gone. This leads Ben and others to scramble for superiority and claim themselves in the new world--the senior world, since as I said before THERE ARE NO SENIORS LEFT. It's really depressing, but mainly exhilarating to know that we are at the top of the food chain now. There is SO MUCH that has happened. There was the FBLA chili cookoff, in which I, Ben Thornton was claimed the new 2004-2005 FBLA president. Then ah, we danced and had a party at Karyn's house, then we watched Donnie Darko, which has somewhat...No mainly become my new obsession, because it is THE best independent film, or film in general, that I have ever seen. I recommend all of you to go and watch the lovely work of cinematic brilliance. And so now as the last few waning days of school pass by, I stop to think about what I have accomplished this year: 1) FBLA SECRETARY 2) PASSED ADVANCED MATH 3) FINISHED OUT THE YEAR IN ENGLISH III WITH AN "A" 4) HAD OUR HAUNTED PORCH 5) WENT TO SCAROWINDS AND KERSEY VALLEY TO CELEBRATE THE HALLOWEEN FESTIVITIES 6) PLAYED IN THE AMOUNTS OF SNOW WE ACTUALLY HAD 7) OUR GROUP PLACED 1ST AT FBLA SLC IN MULTIMEDIA, WE THEREFORE ARE GOING TO DENVER THIS JULY 8) WENT TO BOONE WITH FRIENDS 9) WENT TO MOUNTAINS REPETITIVELY WITH FRIENDS (HOPE TO GO MORE) 10) MADE PRESIDENT, AND STARTED POETRY CLUB, WHICH GAINED INTEREST IN THE CREATIVE WRITING CLASS

      Bonjour mes amis, et bienvenue a un autre jour! What's happening everyone. I am so happy! We might be going to Pilot Mountain (this Friday or Saturday) AND Mary and I are having our attempt of getting cash for Denver by selling our belongings at the yard sale here on Saturday. PLUS Becca and I found a place where we can go and see fireworks down at the lake. Now if we go, I don't really know what we will do other than sit and stare. It's supposed to be at the Abbott's Creek part of High Rock Lake. Which could possibly mean swimming and lounging. So what am I doing? Just sitting here, waiting for something interesting to happen. As is something tragic, happy, whatever. Just something. Maybe someone will come over and visit. Maybe someone will come online and chat. But now, it's nothing but pure solitude. And a bad one at that. Luckily for me, Becca's boyfriend, Tim, is going to get me a few CDs for me to listen to. The new Thursday and Taking Back Sunday CDs. Yesterday I got the Incubus and Alanis Morrisette most latest albums. How he does it, I have no clue, BUT it's awesome. Fifty Three Hours of music on my hard drive. I am debating over whether to go and (lay out in the sun) out of pure boredom, OR go and clean my room. Because ever since Becca's party, it has remained a shithole. And I burned a lot of incense last night to make it smell better. It, for some reason or another, smelt horrible. Cigarette smoke and only god knows what. Speaking of cigarettes, I had the weirdest dream ever. I was smoking a cigarette, and it was "cool". So now I have this urge to smoke. More than likely I was suffering from the awful smell, and it was programmed into me during my restful slumber. Enough of the ways with my crazy theories. Well I am going to embark on a task of meaninglessness.

      Yeah I am here so thats great. My parents are so getting on my nerves, I mean they are lame and pointlessly accusing me of random shit. You know the whole "lost trust" and whatever. Anyways I had my account on AOL taken off today, But I worked my way back online. Go me. And so tomorrow anybody that wants to come over, you can. Rebecca was on last night and said that she wanted to come over and hang out. But seriously, we need to find another place to hang out at, because my house is so boring. There is nothing to do here except find new ways to be crazy. Although it's fun, we could have so much more fun away from Bullshit Central. Well enough for today.

      Hey there everyone. Today Mary and I went to the greatly confusing city of Winston-Salem to see our good friend Jessica. Well I hate Winston, and the place she is staying at is really creepy. But we had a great adventure and we ate at the Olive Garden for only 16 bucks. Total cheap people we are. FRUSTRATIONS. I am so looking forward to Denver. This summer I am actually doing things that I wanted to do. Go. Me.

       urlLink    Well here's most of us. These pictures came from the camera footage we had. Most of it was very early in on the party. We had so much fun. Let's see there was Limbo, Inverted Limbo, Lemon/Onion/Egg bash. Which I accidently got egg all over KatieTucker's Rubbermaid Saturn. Then there was the waterfight from hell, whicg elevated into the mudfight from hell (also complete with various party member's saliva) Loud music. Mary and Kaite almost being killed by Roman candles, fireworks that were so fucking lame, but at-the-time were extremely dangerous. Nikki burning my hand with her after-sex fragrance. And so much more. SO KARYN WHILE YOU MASTURBATED TO JOHNNY DEPP, THIS IS WHAT YOU MISSED. I mean seriously the party was so awesome. Home-made ponchos to go luging down the street with. Mary falling in mud. It was like a minature Woodstock or something. But anyways. It is legendary. And those who missed it suck fat Johnny Depp dildos. Oh and we cut Rebecca's cake with one of those powered knives that you cut turkey with. That was great. I am more than likely forgetting a lot of what happened, but it was so freaking awesome, I don't know what to say. The 7 Hour Movie was seen. We ordered pizza. And the night ended with The 6th Sense. There.&nbsp; urlLink

      I guess there is some deep and dark meaningful message to why I am still up and just staring at the computer screen. I guess its life, passing by. I am so freaking tired! But I can's force myself to sleep. But I am going to try anyway. I look forward to tomorrow (which might just be in 5 hours), and Katie I am sorry that I didn't get your phone call, I must have been watching that scary lady, or swimming. But do call again, and I don't know if you did or not, but leave a message. Not only will you be able to hear my awesome answering machine message, but I get really enthused when there is something for me.

      So what happened today. Fate happened. Apparently I overheard that God is conspiring against us in our quest to make the movie, but I don't care anymore. As a matter of a fact I don't even FEEL like making it. And if I keep telling myself this I might actually hate what I wrote. I was using the hell out of my new French-English Dictionary today. I looked up all of this stuff for reasons that are better left unsaid. I got to see Karyn ten years from now, today at a gas station parking-lot...strung out on acid. This crazy bitch was walking around and falling and running and looking rather creepy. It just made me laugh. Also I am so going to camp out in the backyard. Screw everyone else. And I made plans to go to the pool Thursday. Knowing my luck, it will rain.  But then Friday is Becca's party. And those of you who know Rebecca, she told me to tell you that if you don't show up, the next time she sees you there will be NO Latino-Heat emitted, simply a cold-bitchyness feeling.

      Hey everyone! Today we were supposed to begin filming, but we didn't. It turned out okay though (the day) because: First we went to Doak Park to visit Joe the Purple Fucking Dinosaur Second we got to ride in Kaite's mom's pimped out van Thirdly we went thrifting And all of that other stuff I said I had to do I didn't.  I totally got to hang out with Rebecca though today. And her birthday party is Friday. Everyone is invited. It's here at 3:00pm, and then we might go swimming, to the park/mountains/somewhere. And Rebecca is turning 19! Go Rebecca. Also I got this awesome shirt at Carolina Thrift. Though there wasn't much of a selection, I managed to find an awesome shirt nonetheless. Its a Yacht Race, but apparently the name of the boat is "pussy-footin'" and its too funny not to buy. So 1.77 later I bought a Mr. Pibb and the shirt. The drink was 1.25, and the shirt was .52! I talked to Rebecca about camping and it seems she is up for it. Now everyone else needs to tell me if they can help pay the $9 campsite and help supply food.

      So filming is supposed to start tomorrow. But as all successful directors have difficult tasks, I have this one: Karyn isn't going to be able to come tomorrow because she has to go get her shots or something (Rabies, crotch-depth, whatever) And I haven't been able to get in touch with anyone in regard to the film. So I hope they remember to show up. But realistically, they forgot about it and Mary and I will be stuck, at my house, again, like we have for everything else I have planned. But maybe they will remember. Plus I have to do so much tomorrow it isn't even funny. I have to go and get the camera from Tabitha. I have to go to the school and let them know that I wanted Biology 2, because I was registered for 7 classes, and if this film thing blows over, I am going to be very mad, because I had it all worked out. And I was supposed to go thrifting. I got some really good information about these other places. There is this one on Main Street, that has been praised to me, and my aunt said "It makes Carolina Thrift look like shit." So I must go and investigate this matter. I hope that I am not sitting around here like I always am tomorrow. But anynah, I am really looking forward to Denver, as the days for it get closer and closer. Before I know it I will be there! Also tomorrow I am supposed to go and see how much money I can get for my old trumpets. I have two of them. From when I was in band in middle school. I have an old one, and then I got a new one for Christmas, but I was changed to French horn a month later, so it's in really good condition. Knowing that pawn shoppes are nothing but cheap bastards of places, I might get anywhere from $150-$200 for them. Which could really help me out with my money for Denver fund. We leave on the 13th of July. I am so excited. Also I am really wanting to go camping this summer. If anyone I know is interested, we could really do some awesome backpack hiking in the mountains. But it would require a backpack tent (anywhere from $30-$40), food and drinks. And it would be a one day thing. As in we get there, sleep, and then leave the next day. I was really thinking about some of these parks listed here on this site:  urlLink North Carolina State Parks  Mainly Crowder's Mountain, because I have been there, and it's awesome, and they have remote camp locations, so you can stay up all night without pissing people off. But really this could be a lot of fun! If you are interested, please leave a comment on this post and it will be automatically sent to me. AND even if it is just me, I am so going camping, I mean it's only nine dollars for a site, and around fifty to sixty dollars for food, as in we are only going to be there for lunch, dinner, breakfast, lunch, and snacks and s'mores in between. I mean this is what summer is all about. I have books to read and things to write, and camping is the way to get it done. Relaxation. I need to be working on my summer project to the point of where I am not procrastinating, but then again, not focusing on vacation. Last summer it was all project and no vacation, and it got so boring after a while that I wanted to quit it. But I didn't. And this time I am reading each day and taking notes and whatnot to keep me on a schedule for it or something. I am rambling, but for real I am going camping. My mom's car aka: the ford fuckus has been officially ghettoized. The "c" from Focus is gone and now it says Fo us, as in "Dah car is fo us!" Or in white people's language-anti ebonics: The car is for us!" It's quite humorous to see and I swore I heard my car laugh as it pulled in tonight.

      Hey everyone. Filming starts Monday at 1:00pm sharp. So it should be lots of fun! I fixed my windshield wipers! Go me! Seriously I am so happy that it is summer. I have had nothing to do for a month almost. I finally got my book for my English project. It seems so boring and uber-lame. But I have to read it. Speaking of school, I received my schedule and I only have seven classes, so I need to call in on Monday and make sure they know that I am wanting to take Biology 2. Also the French classes weren't on there, but hopefully I will have at least one. If not it's business law and foods.

      suicide is painless  Cast- Cassandra- Mary 				Sylvia- Karyn Marc-	Ben 				        Jean-Paul (JP)- Charlie Ms. Blackwater-	Rebecca 	                Liberal Parent-  Conservative parent- Katie  Opening credits (Camera views over typical items of the poetic teenagers such as The Bell Jar, The Virgin Suicides, On The Road, Donnie Darko, Taking Back Sunday CD’s, Mac Beth Cliffnotes and a book entitled “Suicide for Dummies”  Scene I FIVE DAYS THREE HOURS FOUR MINUTES EIGHT SECONDS (The scene begins with a reading of a poem out of a rugged looking typical teenage diary) Cassandra- Today marks the first day in the end of my life. It is one in which all of my tension and pain will finally end, a day for me to finally breathe a sigh of relief, because there will be so much to look forward to… Sylvia- (throws object at Cassandra) You stole that line from Donnie Darko you fuck.  Cassandra- So what, I think it sums my state up don’t you think? Sylvia- No, I think you are just another teenager who thinks that the end of your life is over because you finally realized you are a fucking bitch. Cassandra- Fuck off Sylvia, at least I don’t worship goddam Sylvia Plath so much that I took her middle name after I read The Bell Jar in 8th grade. Sylvia- Yeah well, at least her shit makes sense (Grabs diary) Tension and pain will finally end… listen bitch, go ahead and end it so you can end MY tension and pain FROM THE SHIT I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH FROM YOU! Marc- Okay can the bitch sessions end for a fucking minute. Nothing is sacred to you guys. The date is rolling around and all you fucking do is fight and argue. Jean-Paul- We could only be so lucky for them to fight, we just have to listen to this shit.  Sylvia- No, there is nothing sacred to me, I am a goddam atheist.  Jean-Paul- No, you’re a typical rebellion child, trying to rebel against your parents because they didn’t want you ending up the way you are. Sylvia- Fuck you, JP, just because you made better on the English test doesn’t mean that you have special rights to be so critical to everyone.  Jean-Paul- What the hell does that have to do with anything? Sylvia- Nothing, I just think that you are a fucker for not talking me like you just did. Cassandra- (reads more poetry) Life is a bore; death will surely spice it up for a little. Sylvia- Can you spare me the bullshit emotional suck-ass poetry for ONE WHOLE DAY.  Marc- Dammit, you guys suck, I am leaving. I have a headache. Jean-Paul- Hey I am coming too, have any pain killers, I need a numbing afternoon.  Marc- No unfortunately I am going to steal more from my parents this afternoon. Jean-Paul-Hey don’t you guys kill each other without getting it on video, that shit can make us rich on the Internet. (The boys leave, and the girls sit mumbling stuff) (Scene closes as the camera views on a large TBS poster)  Scene II  FOUR DAYS FOUR HOURS FIFTY NINE MINUTES SIX SECONDS (Scene opens as Marc gets medicine from his parent’s room) (He then goes into his room and starts writing) (Cassandra is crying as she writes) (Sylvia has an angry look as she writes) (Jean-Paul writes the word “fuck” on his book then throws it across the room and goes to sleep)  Scene III  THREE DAYS TWELVE HOURS ONE MINUTE THIRTY SECONDS (Scene opens as the quartet of friends are walking outside)  Cassandra- So I was thinking… Sylvia- You actually think? Cassandra- Yes, so shut the hell up. Anyways I was thinking, about TBS what if we are the only ones interested? Marc- Then all more the reason to go through with it. Jean-Paul- Well I don’t think Cassandra will actually do it, I think she will be a little chicken-shit and just not go through with it. Cassandra- No I have the perfect reason.  Sylvia- You mean there’s an actual reason towards your suicidal feelings? Cassandra- Yes, what’s with you are you writing a goddam book? Sylvia- Maybe. Did you know that Sylvia Plath’s book…? Jean-Paul- Yes we know it. Marc- And that it is semi-autobiographical. Cassandra- And that she ended up killing herself by suffocating herself in a gas oven.  Marc- This is only the fifth time today you have drawn some sort of similarity to Sylvia Plath. Sylvia- So it would only be natural to have a diary when you are on the brink of suicide. Marc- It would only be so mainstream. Jean-Paul- I agree, I mean it’s more mysterious if the person doesn’t leave any information towards why they felt suicidal. Sylvia- You guys are just trying to break the mold so much you are ignoring the “seven steps to the perfect suicide” Marc- What?  Cassandra- Yeah it’s in this book (gives the Suicide for Dummies book to Marc) Marc- Where in the hell did you get this from? Cassandra- At the thrift store. Jean-Paul- Go figure. Cassandra- Apparently it says that we have to follow these steps to make the perfect suicide. Marc- but this is a MASS suicide, you dumbass, how in the hell are we supposed to do all of this if there are a lot of us? Sylvia- As long as we commit it at the same time, it is still classified as a mass suicide, so we don’t necessarily have to be in one large group.   Scene IV  TWO DAYS SIX HOURS TWO MINUTES TWENTY ONE SECONDS (Scene opens as Cassandra and Jean-Paul are sitting outside with their books) Cassandra- What are you thinking right now? Jean-Paul- That it would be cool to have a cult. Cassandra- Yeah that would be awesome. Jean-Paul- You know to make the mass suicide really massively recognizable. Cassandra- Yeah, but we wouldn’t be able to get all of the items in the book to do it right. Jean-Paul- You’re right. (Sylvia walks over) Sylvia- Hey, you guys, what are you doing? Cassandra- Talking about cults. Sylvia- Yeah I was thinking about that too. It would be so cool to have a few tranquilizers some pudding and a fifth of vodka to make a great suicidal cocktail then leave five dollar bills in our pockets, so that we can get on a spaceship that’s flying behind a comet. (Jean-Paul and Cassandra look at each other)  Scene V  ONE DAY FOUR HOURS FIVE MINIUTES THIRTY SECONDS (Scene opens to typical emo song. The quartet of friends lay assorted in random positions across the floor.) Cassandra- I am so bored. Sylvia- I am so fucking tired of you. Marc- Here it goes again.  (Knock at the door) Jean-Paul- Who the fuck is here? Cassandra- I don’t know JP, why don’t you get off of your lazy ass and find out. Jean-Paul- Fuck off Cassandra. (Jean-Paul goes to see who is at the door.) Jean-Paul- What the fuck, I mean what are you doing here Ms. Blackwater? Ms. Blackwater- I was in the neighborhood, and thought I would drop your project off.  Jean-Paul- Okay, thanks.  (Ms. Blackwater drop a large amount of papers on the floor) (Cassandra goes to help pick them up) Cassandra- What is this? (Cassandra reads a poem entitled “My Homage to Greedy Motherfucker”) Cassandra- Is this yours JP? Sylvia- No it can’t be, it’s too good. Ms. Blackwater- Sorry I guess my poem got messed up with your project JP. Jean-Paul- That’s pretty good, aren’t you going to a reading tonight. Ms. Blackwater- Yeah, but I heard that it was supposed to be filled with old fuckers reading about flowers, and the breeze. Sylvia- Hey Cassandra, you should go then, maybe you could even find a hot old guy, or girl. Ms. Blackwater- Let me interrupt what is going to become another typical third period bitch fight to say, Sylvia, you would be a much nicer person if you quit talking and showing emotion. You take emo-girl to a whole new level that even I, the queen of bitches, can’t comprehend. Sylvia- What the fuck, whatever. Just because JP and you are fucking doesn’t mean that you have to take up for his sister. Ms. Blackwater- No JP and I aren’t fucking. And I feel bad for you because nobody wants to get a piece of your certified bitch ass, because you always have some type of defense mechanism going on, you know what you need to get laid, and then you wont be such a hard ass. (Sylvia gets up and goes to the kitchen) Ms. Blackwater- So if you guys are interested in going tonight, please feel free to hear my poem.  Marc- I think we might end up going. Ms. Blackwater- Okay see you then.  Scene VI (Scene opens as Ms. Blackwater is finishing her poem, a sign that reads POETRY READING TONIGHT tosses in the wind) Ms. Blackwater- So fuck you AND I HOPE YOU EAT CHICKEN LIVERS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. (Audience is non-responsive, Marc and Sylvia clap) Marc- Okay my poem doesn’t have a name… Lets all be real republican ass-whores and not realize that we are a combined youth, not to sit alone, or to segregate, Let’s all try to kill each other once in a while and then we will surely make it in the yearbooks. Everyone else is doing it. (Audience claps) Conservative parent- Young man, what you just read it an atrocity of literature. I am going to read a poem with a little more class and definition it’s called My Oak Tree… “Oh oak tree that stood by me, oh oak tree that shaded my lawn, oh oak tree whose love is forever gone.” (Everybody claps, except the liberal parent) Liberal parent- You call that class. It sounds like a tale from some African child who with Christian aid finally learned to read and write in English, and finally acquired the skills necessary to compose a work of literature. In your terms it was absolutely horrid. (Everybody claps) Liberal parent- THAT WASN’T A FUCKING POEM. Conservative parent- Oh I love the way that… Liberal parent- Listen bitch back the fuck off. You sit here in your little porch style atmosphere and won’t let these kids really express themselves without giving them hell about it. You need a reality check okay. Conservative parent- Reality check? I’ll tell you what I need. I need you and your foulmouthed hooligans to find a dark and scary place to read your satanic works of “literature” Liberal parent- Okay we will go and leave, but remember sometimes, even the most republican men are gay.  (The conservative parent’s husband walk in with a pain in what seems to be identified as his ass, moans as he sits down) (Everybody laughs)  Scene VII (Scene opens as Ms. Blackwater is leaving a coffee shoppe) Stalker- Hey ma’am do you have a light? Ms. Blackwater- Sorry I don’t smoke. Stalker- I enjoyed your poetry. Ms. Blackwater- Were you at the reading? Stalker- No I was watching you. (Ms. Blackwater walks away) Stalker- Hey bitch where the fuck are you going, I was talking to you! (Blackwater runs to her car, but stalker catches her and is trying to rape her) Ms. Blackwater- Help! Get off of me you Motherfucker! (After some deal of torment Blackwater gets free and runs, but the stalker shoots her)  Scene VII  NO DAYS, ONE HOUR, EIGHT MINUTES, THIRTY ONE SECONDS (Scene opens as Cassandra is crying, fades to JP writing, fades to Sylvia reading The Bell Jar, fades to Marc reading Ms. Blackwater’s poem)  Scene VIII  (Cassandra is reading the Suicide for Dummies book, and planning for her suicide, she is checking items off of a list and goes to hanging position. She notices an unchecked item and attempts to get this fixed while still in the noose, she slips and hangs herself.) Jean-Paul- Cassandra what the hell are you doing? (Jean-Paul goes to Cassandra, and starts freaking out)  Scene IX  (JP is driving to the bridge. Car stops, and makes a trail of dust. Cuts to scene of  JP on the edge of the bridge, same view but without JP and then a farther shot of the bridge but without JP on it, focusing on the sunlight and water.)  Scene X  (Sylvia enters the room where Marc is lounging) Sylvia- What are you doing? Marc- Relaxing, why? Sylvia- Oh just wondering. Did you ever like Ms. Blackwater? Marc- Yeah, why, don’t you hate her or something? Sylvia- Yeah, and damn if the bitch ain’t finally dead! Marc- What? (Sylvia gives Marc the news article) Marc- What do you mean finally dead? Sylvia- I mean some guy, that wasn’t actually from school wanted to fuck her and she ran away. It’s because she’s a lesbian. Marc- You are such a bitch. Sylvia- And as far as this little mass suicide, I am so out. The two siblings fucked up the plan and had to go all public about it. Marc- They are dead? Sylvia- Yeah, what about you, aren’t you too chicken shit to do it? That’s what JP said. You know I never got to tell them how much I wouldn’t miss them. Marc- Fuck you. Sylvia- No, Marc fuck you. You are such a fucking idiot. God I don’t know why I waste my time with you. (Mark goes out of the room, and Sylvia goes to channel surfing) Sylvia (mumbling to herself)- Fuck them, I am so leaving. (Sylvia goes to get up and is met with Marc and he has a gun) (Sylvia laughs) Sylvia- What the fuck is that? Marc- I guess you won’t get your wish. Sylvia- What? Marc- Your wish, you stupid fucking bitch, to die like Sylvia Plath. Sylvia- Are you going to…(laughs)…are you going to shoot me? Marc- No, I am going to but the little bitch out of her misery. (Marc shoots Sylvia, and feathers from where the bullet has entered the sofa fly and land on Sylvia’s bleeding body.) (Marc laughs at her then very rapidly takes the gun to the side of his head and shoots himself, consisting of the gunshot then camera seeing Marc fall to the floor bleeding) (More feathers landing)  Scene XI  (Scenes of the teen’s deaths are seen. Narraration begins:I really hate life. My parents are a couple of stuck-up snobs, they don’t give a shit about me. It’s a good thing, I guess, I hate them too. But my so-called friends are all the same way. Sylvia is such a fucking bitch, Marc is so wrapped up in our goddam English teacher, and I bet my own brother doesn’t even care. The whole mass suicide idea was really novel for an act of attention, but now I want to kill myself even more just because all of those bastards fucking hate me so much. I hate them too.) (Cassandra hanging. JP washed up on shore. Sylvia lying with feathers. Marc on the floor.) (View of Cassandra’s journal) (Closing credits)

      Alright I have no clue what in the hell is up with my 's apostrophes they were little squares in the post. But I forgot to mention that I went outside just now, and it is beautiful! I mean 3:20 here in Thomasville never gets that much attention, but I guess that it is the nature-connect side of me, I really thought you should know this, because the late night is amazing. I mean think about it. 5:00 am is my favorite. And also I thought I would let everyone see the plot for our new film: The Tapes;  (Reader beware, it's another dark tale from the screwed up mind of yours truly, but really it's got such an "independent film" "sundance winner" feel) Storyline: through a series of tapes we are given a view of a typical teenage group of friends that videotape their lives. They begin predictable, and very funny. But as they continue, several layers of darkness are uncovered. And as one of the friends is murdered, we begin to see the evil within the circle of friends. The movie begins as some of the parents find these videos. All of the friends have committed suicide and several questions need to be answered.

       urlLink    Okay, I don�t know what it is but I am so freaking down this week. I mean I thought my semi-depression state of the year was over, but apparently it wasn�t. Or maybe it�s these following figures: I went to Melissa�s yesterday and left a note and went there again today, the letter was gone, and still, nobody was there. I really hope her scary boyfriend isn�t being an ass and not letting her talk to me.  I had a freaky dream that, since Karyn is gone for this part of June, that she had saved all of our IM conversations and spell-checked them all and then totally quit talking to me.  Rebecca is back from New York and because of her lame ass job, she has to work all of the time and we never get to talk much anymore. Plus she said that she was just going to the beach with her boyfriend for her birthday, which probably means that our get-together will not occur.  We will not make it camping. That�s what�s in my mind set right now, but I am going to see that my fucking ass camps one day out of this horrible summer, even if it is alone. Which would be really good for me, since I have to get in touch with myself on so many different levels, and finally tie things up in my mind. I mean yeah I really like to be around people, but then again, my best work, poetic, artistic, philosophy, etc are created. I need contact with the following people: Mary, because I have to show her the plot for our movie we are going to make. Melissa, because I want to affirm that she is not with some freaking loser who won�t let her talk to another guy. I am really helping myself out by playing my �I Am Depressed Today� playlist. Hopefully those of you who read this will leave me a little something to make me happy, like a treat or something.  &nbsp; urlLink

      Oh, great it's storming now. So Rebecca is FINALLY back from New York. And I don't think Karyn is back from her little family fun get together. I went today to go and see Melissa, but she wasn't there so I left a spastic letter. And hopefully she will return with a phone call or something. Anyways I am getting me some Jets to Brazil music. Ahh, I am wanting to sit and relax and enjoy summer but everyone is wanting to be so ruh-shed. I am just wanting to sit on the front porch and drink lemonade in the midst and mist of the approaching storm. But everyone is always like "Ben come here and do this," or "Ben come here and take me to the pool." I found some tunes to play on my violin the other day. Let's see there was the beginning of Britney Spears' "Toxic" and then there was the all-well-known "Bittersweet Symphony" and I ended up getting Vivaldi's "Spring" from the Four Seasons. It's horribly easy. And I haven't even purchased the book for my summer English project. Which is very un-natural of me. I usually have it done (the entire project) by the second week in July. Then again, I still have time. PROCRASTINATE NOW, DON'T PUT IT OFF!

      So I have been reading like mas today. I guess procrastinations catch up to you. And with only one and a half weeks left before the inition of school, I thought I better get the move on with my reading. So I read a whole phase tonite and hope to do the same tomorrow, and the next day. Perhaps even reading more in one day. That way I will have more than enough time to prepare the lame project and take the SAT thing, that I still haven't done. Well I am really proud of myself for making "me" read. Although I had to lock myself in the car and read with a book light to sway me from other influences (ie: internet, television, family). There. Now I have to download the SAT thing and I will take it in the morning, as well as read MORE because I have to get this done before next week.

      Here are the full details of what happened. I thought that if anyone wanted the extended version of the Denver Chronicles that they can go to Mary's site  urlLink Mary Explains It All . And you can understand the extent of the trip, and why I miss it so much. But for those of you who kno me, this happens to me all the time. Something really awesome ends---I get depressed and loathe in my self-pity-pool and yeah. Anyways I am not making this as near as a big deal as summer camp, because I mean I get to see the Mary Black in like 2 weeks since thats when school starts. Or maybe even sooner, as I have to pay her for the doubles of pictures I requested. And we have to make a scrapbook. Okay. Leaving now, because I am so bored and tired of being online. Need outdoor exposure. After living in Denver for 6 days you learn that the outdoors really are an integral part of being alive and whatnot. But anyways, ciao mes amigos!

       Yesterday Karyn, Katie, Matt and I went to the fabulous Lake Thom-A-Lex and we hung out. With our new hula hoops and large brown bottle of root beer. A few cigarettes and laughs later, we left. That was the extent of the day, but it was quite enjoyable. I look forward to more of these occurances. And I have to finish reading that god for saking book. Shit. Shit. Anyways I thought I would let you guys know what I have been up to. There, that's it. Bye! Oh and if you really want to be cool you can e-mail me at my g-mail account at:  urlLink THORNTONSTER@gmail.com &nbsp;  Si, au revoir mes amis, parce que je suis tres presse pour les temps maintenant.

      Okay so I got in from Denver today at around 3:00, and I was at home around 6:00. Yay traffic. But here's what happened: We left for Denver and chatted on the way to the airport. We boarded the plane after playing and finding too much amusement on the moving sidewalks. I had to sit with J-Lo for god's sake and he wouldn't shut up or quit sleeping on me. Anyways the flight was really good until our descent into Denver. I mean I guess it had to do something with the winds coming off of the rockies but it was horrible. So we then waited for an hour for our baggage, got the taxi ordeal settled and got into the hotel finally. We then explored the hotel and the surrounding block. We had a comedy show that night and it was not that funny, but leave it to the MaryBlack to make it a memorable time. The comedians were like "someone give me a topic that you have heard in a recent conversation" the MaryBlack replied "Necrophilia" and then it was born. The evil lovechild from the womb of MaryBlack. We had a lame NC State meeting that night and we were so tired we went to sleep. Then we get up and go white water rafting the next morning. It was fun, cold, and fun to see the other boats suck at rafting. That was about it for that day. We ate mostly at the concierge lounge on the 17th floor, because it is free. That night we had opening session and we ate at the Rocky Mountain Diner, which was okay, I mean I wish I would have got buffalo meatloaf instead of a balsamic vinegarette salad. So anyways opening session was lame and that night we had a gathering. It was the MaryBlack, the Katie and the Brittany and I. We listened to the lesbian love problems on Loveline and then we crashed. The next day J-Lo, the MaryBlack and I visit LoDo (Lower Downtown) and we found a great rockwall, and great shops. I got separated from Mary and it was horrible. I bought shirts. The others went to a baseball game and we went to Casa Bonita, the Mexican version of Chuckie Cheese's. There were people high diving into pools there while we ate and there was a magic show and it was a really cool place. Nobody else liked it except for Mary and I, the others were constantly bitching. It was fun to talk about them though. Mainly when we weren't running all over the place we were at the health spa. Either in the pool, the steam room, the sauna, or the gym, running and what not. So we were technically running all the time. That night we had another gathering except this time we ordered room service, and it was excellent. Mrs. Adcock was "drunk" and she was hilarious.  The next day we climbed the rockwall and I became a member of REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.) I had a salad at Starbucks, apparently its a new thing, and it was the best ever. Then we climbed and left. There was a big ordeal though because we were supposed to go to 6 Flags that day, but we had to go saturday. Lalalalalalalater we finally are told that we have to eat with the group at Hard Rock Cafe, which we had already eaten at. Mary and I basically got bitched out for not going to eat with the group. Woo-Hoo. We burned a few calories though and met some people during the Denver Disaster--Some idiot messed up a room by taking the fire extinguisher out and playing with it, and later pulling a fire alarm. We sat and talked to some people.  On the way to Six Flags I got bitched out by the ex-advisor for not going with the group to eat the previous night. The park was very small and very lame, but we (mary jordan and I) rode the skycoaster, and it was awesome. We then left, got separated by the trains, and were late to closing session because we had to get something to eat. We ate food from taco bell and some black girl called mary Boo-Boo. Well we got bitched out at for being late. And we didn't win. I was wondering if we had won, would we still be bitched at? Huh? No! But then they all wanted to eat at this crazily expensive Italian Restaurant. A smoothie from Jamba Juice filled Katie, Mary and I up though. WE left the group to go to the dance. And it was a great time. Then we had to give food to the homeless, and it scared me. Then we crashed got up and left. I miss Denver. I might want to skip out on Appalachian and go to AIDenver instead. (Arts Institute) Yay! But here I am all by my lonesome. I miss my friends and I miss being away from home. I went to go and get pics developed and stuff to make a scrapbook. So if anybody wants to help, you can!

      Hey everybody! I am leaving for Denver in about 30 minutes and I thought I would say hello and goodbye before I leave. Now that that's taken care of here's the run-down on what happened this week:  Anticipation Anticipation Getting traveler's cheques and Anticipation. There mot much of a week. Actually it was quite a bitch.  And I just remembered that today is Tuesday. I swear I thought it wa Saturday.  Because when I was getting my stuff at the bank, I saw the KellyReddick and she was cashing a check, so I figured it was Friday. Leave it to me to draw conclusions.  Anyways, I made my entire music library portable. I had to go to the store to get blank CDs, film, and batteries. I only had a 100 dollar bill, and they gave me change back in all 5's. Hahaha! My favourite number. Anyways I burnt 41 CDs, an exact copy of my music library, for my audio pleasure in Denver, 56 hours enough? I guess so. But I am getting my luggage ready and stuff, and I can't wait until we leave. We leave school for the airport at 9:00, then our flight leaves out of Charlotte at 12 or so, but I am just so excited I can barely type. I hardly slept last night. I was up every 2 hours, it's sort of like trying to sleep on Christmas Eve, I just get so happy, I won't sleep, or eat. But I figure a lunch at the airport will be fine, I mean it takes 2 whole hours to check in and everything, with all of the security stuff. Well I am going to go and find something else to amuse myself with. Will give full details when I return. I love all of my friends!

      So I am here memorizing the new Taking Back Sunday CD. And I went to the mall today and bought three shirts. Which is a big deal, because I dont like to spend money. It's the main reason thrift stores are so cool for me. But I bought a blue shirt and two brown ones. Though I am always looking for green t's I can never find any that fit. There was a green polo shirt at Gap, but apparently, the fashions have changed to fit the more obese groups of Americans, and alas there are no fitable green shirts for the skinny ass Ben. Yeah $30 bucks gone too. Dammit. But I don't care, I have another yardsale! And we are having it at Katie's house. And it should be great!

      So the yardsale went really well. I got $150 from it. And it was fun. Yesterday I went out and bought the Donnie Darko DVD with the money I got from washing the car. The "Fo_us". And today I am just really bored. Which just do happens to be the biggest chiche ever in my life. And we didn't go to the lake, and it's thundering, I guess God is also celebrating the American's independence from the British over 200 years ago.

       urlLink    So my aunt just bought a brand new Volvo XC90 to replace her S60. And it's great. I mean turbo-powered and safe as any other SUV made. I got the chance to drive it and I must admit, Volga, you ain't got shit on this beast. 0-60 in 5 seconds I think, as I did take it out on the highway to get a good listen to the turbo. In-dash 6-CD changer, sunroof, dual air controls and for back seat. She decided to not get the 3rd seat because she got the Pet Package with the kennel separator. I mean it's great.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    OMG My aunts new freaking 2004 Volvo XC90! So awesome. Not like the S60 was bad or anything but an upgrade is an upgrade. These were taken tonight and I even got to drive it! Turbo charged and ready to go, drives and feels like a car, but its big roomy, and awesome on gas mileage. Hardly any emmisions AND the radiatior cleans the air as it drives eating all the nasty air from the piece-of-shit-cars. Well I could sit here and say all the benefits of the Volvo XC90, but then again you could visit the website at VOLVOXC90.com&nbsp; urlLink

      Hey everyone. Sorry on my lack of posting but things have been crazy around here. With me getting a job and everything, haven't had time to do anything. So yesterday my friends (Mary, Karyn, Katie and her boyfriend Matt) all went to go shopping for tax-free weekend. We shopped and stuff. I bought a Taking Back Sunday and Interpol shirt. Along with a pair of corduroys. Concord Mills was fun. Then we went hiking, and it was awesome. We all had a blast at Crowder's (Croucher's) Mountain. We decided to go eat at IHOP. My car boiled over, and we went to Wal-Mart go get corks and coolant. Volga was fixed and we had a great time. Yesterday was one of the best days I have ever lived. (It's up there with Denver and such) I drew a sketc from the top of the mountain. Karyn drew her hand and a cigarette.
