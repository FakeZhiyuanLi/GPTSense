           Yesterday when I was talking with a friend on the phone, I said: "Remember what we did on the birthday? We bought a fancy cake and threw it onto each other's face..." She replied: "Right... that was aobut ten years ago, and we were happy at that moment. You know what, if we were at the same place now, we should do that again, just for fun! But... anyway, we are grown-ups. We have other ways to celibrate." Well, if there is anything not good for being a grown-up, I think this is one--we don't do those crazy but funny things any more.     My birthday went by. I read a novel, made some phone calls, and had a great dinner with benben. I thought "this is it", and felt satisfied. But... there were something more. I was called to Donald and Kun's place to have dinner. Karen, Annie, and benben were also there. We often hang out together, and I thought this time it wouldn't be any different. So I just sat there and enjoyed my favorite "for love or money". There it came--a big birthday cake with lovely candles, and they were singing "happy birthday" for me. Believe it or not, I really really did not expect that. For one minute I was speechless. Then I thought: "I wanna cry. I wanna say 'thank you'." But I did neither. I just kept the happiness deep in my heart.     We didn't threw the cake onto our faces. Annie, our little sister, did suggest we do that (She dared not to do that without our allowance, haha...). But of course it was denied by we grown-ups. We finished half of the cake (The other half is now in Don's refrige.).     I kinda miss the way we spent the birthday ten years ago. Though those days are gone, I'm still totally happy. The reason for that? Something called love and friendship.

       That movie, the Stepford Wives, by Nicole Kidman, is kinda nice one to watch when you are waiting for a special day to come. It's funny, and makes you relax (especially when there are three friends around you and laugh at the same time with you). It was over. Let me see my watch--11:14pm on June 26. Yes, my day is coming! I got online right after I reached home, and waited. When the clock turned to 0:00, I said... But wait, who was that, Talking to me on MSN? Oh it was benben, saying "happy bithday" with a cute picture. Thanks benben, for being the first one, for that picture, for... just everything, everything that makes you live forever in my life. And now: "Happy birthday to myself! I love this world."

           Since the end of semester, weekend and weekdays seem no different to me. I do what I plan to everyday. There is a "two thumbs up" movie? Fine, I'll go and check it out any evening. I know exactly what the date is today. But how about the day? Err... isn't it Thursday, oh wait a minute, my roomie just told me she doesn't have to work tomorrow, so it must be Friday.     My brother called me just now before he went to lunch (yeah right in China that was  lunch time). He said at last: "Hey you have a great weekend, OK?" How could I forget? it's weekend.     That's what makes the student life fabulous, the freedom!

       Get up early in the morning, eat some wholewheat something, put the lens on, and then throw myself out into that rush traffic. Yeah my day starts. I work, I study, I read, I exercise, I do almost everything people do; I love, I hate, I smile, I cry, sometimes I maybe extremely emotional. Such an ordinary person, huh? Right I'm just the girl next door. But my life sometimes is really colorful. I always believe in a brighter future, and go for it. Hmmm hopefully some day I may become the princess next door.

       For years when I was a teen, I used to think like: "If you don't show it, you don't have it." And that was my point of view about  wealth  for long. I remember there was one time when my Dad's watch was out of work, I followed him to buy a new one. As soon as I saw a luxury, good-looking, but really expensive one, I yelled out: "Daddy, buy this one, this one. It's nice!" Dad, who always respects his daughter's opinions, took a glance and said: "No, precious. It's too expensive." "But you could afford that." I insisted. Dad frowned at me and said: "We buy watch to know the time, not to display. I won't buy that one." I don't know how many people agree with the idea that "'better off' means having a nice home in an upscale neighborhood, fine clothes for everyone in the family, classy cars, club memberships, and items purchased in the best stores". To me, this was sorta a symbol. That was why I was annoyed when Dad bought a cheap, ugly watch that day. The words "income in the form of capital gains" were introduced to me not by Dad. But when I first heard about that, I tought of him. Some of my views are changing as I grow up, so I get better and better understanding about my father. That makes me happy.

       I don't believe in fate. I definitely not. But there are something I truly admire, and that's for some men called "the destiny"--the thing that they die for. Maybe you've heard a movie named "the terminal", or maybe not. Anyway it's such a great movie that you probably will remember it forever after seeing it. A man, Victor, endures a lot to keep his promise, and finally makes it happen. Well what he's trying to do may be so worthless (or even insane) for some others, just some pieces of paper in a rusty can. But for Victor, that's what supports him to fight. When I was watching, I thought this man must be so mentally strong. But to him, it's just two simple words: "I wait." Stories about heros (sometimes they are called by those that couldn't understand them "coward") often move me into tears. King Arthur and his knights fight for the belief in freedom, in their land, and in their people. Victor, the one more down to earth, finds his chance to do what he means to do. I know I'm just an ordinary person, but there is still a destiny out there for me, and I'm working hard for it.

       Soon after I turned 24, I become much more serious about the thought: "Okay now since I'm really an adult, I'm gonna make sure that myself looks like one." Here we go--on the first weekend of my age 24, I went shopping with a super mature friend (before I called her I had searched for a long time in my call list to make sure I'd find the right one). Well my judgement never goes wrong. As soon as she heard I said "Well I kinda wanna do something about my look... just... err... more... mature...",  She pushed me to the cosmetic counter and discussed with the saleslady about my skin, my face, my neck. After they seemed agree with each other, they started putting things on me: foundation, concealer, powder, blush, and bronzer (these are what I can still recall). After I was "perfectly done", I looked at myself and murmured: "Do I look different?" "Sure you do," they said, "you are more beautiful!" Many say that beauty should come from what's inside. I totally agree. But when I heared I was more beautiful just after wearing those many things, I couldn't help to pay the high price (at least for me at this moment) price for it. That's not it. On the way home, when I was still wondering: "Do I spend so much money on those, do I buy so many shirts...", my just-be stylist said: "You know what, you should definitely dye your hair! Let's go. Buy the hair color." "Well I dyed my hair before, and..." "No. You did it the wrong way. This time let me do this for you. You should use at least two colors." What could I say? I had called her to hang out for a new look. So I followed her. What do I look like now? Believe it or not, in the mirror, I look not bad: the make-up, new shirts and pants, colored hair (finally there are two colors there, and one of them I would never try if no one's pushing me). I don't know how long I'm gonna keep looking like this. You know the make-up is really not easy for me to do it all by myself. But next time shopping (when I again have enough money)? I know definitely whom to call.
