      April 30, 2004  Well, since this is my first blog, I thought I'd write a little bit about myself.  I'll be 26 this month.  I live in Chicago and I am from Dallas.  I miss it everyday, but something tells me if I moved home I would miss this place just as much.  I have a boyfriend with whom I have been with for a year and a half now.  Things are currently rocky, but come to think of it, I guess they have been for a while.  I've never been married and I don't have any children.  Though sometimes I wish I would've found someone to settle down with.  I don't know if I'll ever "settle down".  I don't think I'm the type.  But that's another discussion for another time.  I used to write a lot and now I don't do it nearly as much as I'd like or should.  It's been hard for me to keep a flow of thoughts because I am so distracted when I am home.  Tony is loud you know.  He is over zealous.  When he comes home everything becomes 10 decibels louder.  He can't stand for it to be quiet.  This is where we have problems.  I grew up in a house where everything was always loud.  The TV was always on.  Mom and Dad were yelling.  It's no wonder I started writing when I was 13.  For a while I didn't even have a door to close, so I would just add to the noise and turn on the radio.  Anyway, living like that for 17 years has made me appreciate things being quiet.  But I managed to hook up with someone who can't stand it.  It does wreck my flow.  I used to hate it when he wouldn't come home for a while after work.  Now that I've just accepted that it will happen, I've learned to use the time to do something productive other than get pissed off and look out the window every five minutes.  Thus the blogging.  Maybe I'll put some of my poetry up on here.  Baby step till 4 o'clock. Baby step till 4 o'clock.  3:11.  Sure could go for a nice cold one right now.  It's cloudy and cold.  It's my friend Joe's birthday today.  I didn't get him anything and we are supposed to have dinner and drinks later.  I hope I am still awake by then.  Guess I'll wrap this up and get some coffee.  End.

      Texas was Great! I had so much fun. I was so angry about coming back here. I joked with Tony before I left for the airport Sunday to send me my shit but I was a little serious.  All night I sat in my house after the flight and it didn't feel like home anymore.  The cat just kept meowing.  It was fucking annoying. I don't know if Tony even fed him while I was gone.  He promised the house would be as clean as I left it and there was a pile of dishes in both sides of the sink.  It looked like he hadn't done that the whole time I was gone either. He kept saying, "I'll clean it Jana, don't worry about it, it will only take 2 seconds." Yeah, ended up taking an hour and not enough room for all the dishes in the dishwasher.  His immaturity drives me crazy.  He was 30 minutes late picking me up from the airport.  Unbelievable.  You'd think he'd be a little excited to see me, but nope, apparently not excited enough.  Everything is always about him and I'm just tired of it.  Anyway, enough about him.  Back to Texas.  I got to see my nephew.  He is 16 months now.  He walks around and says stuff.  His new thing to say is "oh man".  He says it for everything.  If he drops something, "oh man", if he accidentally knocks something over, "oh man". It is the cutest thing.  I hung out with all of my friends every night and on Saturday I went to my cousins graduation party.  I got drunk every night I was there.  I haven't had that much fun in a looong time.  I really want to leave this place.  I keep thinking about just going home and getting my things and leaving.  I think that is bogus to do though atleast to the people I work with.  I don't think my body has completed weened itself off of all the alcohol I consumed.  I wake up feeling tired everyday.  Anyway, I didn't do dishes the whole time I was home or clean a damn thing for that matter and it was great.  I just slept, ate, drank, drank some more and that's about it.  Everything was a party. Everyone had jokes.  Everyone was laughing and happy all the time.  Since I've been back I have been moping around.  I feel like I don't even have anything to say to anyone, especially Tony.  The boy does not love me.  I don't see how it's possible.  I know he is cheating on me.  It's just a gut feeling women have and although I don't have solid proof or evidence, there have been too many funny coincidences to just keep turning my head.  Plus, I think I fell for Drew again.  For so long, I have been faithful to the people I am with and loyal, and it was hard for me to even find anyone else attractive let alone concieve of cheating, but I really think Drew is the one.  I have always thought this.  But I tossed it aside because I live here and he lives there and that would never work.  I'm not one for lonliness nor do I have the money to go see him all the time.  Anyway, he is still in love with me.  He told me so.  We have so much fun together.  And I just started thinking about all the shit Tony pulls on me all the time and how everything he does just makes us fight and makes me mad.  I think I have invested far too much time into this thing with him and I don't see this going anywhere.  I feel like a damn fool too.  No woman would put up with the shit he does to me.  He just takes advantage of me and I let him because I have been stupid.  I think I'll ask him tonight if he can find a roommate.  And maybe I'll just move my stuff into storage and shack up with someone for a while until I can get my shit together to move.  It sounds so crazy to talk like this and I never thought there would be a day that I would be genuinely unhappy here, but there is nothing for me here anymore.  When I think of this place all that comes to mind is heartache and lies and all the struggle I've had to go through just to even BE happy.  At home, happiness comes so easily.  On that note, I'm going to end this.  I have to start thinking of someway to get out of here.  Oh yeah, it's cloudy and crappy again today.  I can't remember the last time I saw sunshine in this city.  I know my birthday will be crappy weather too.  It always is.

      I leave for Texas in the morning. I feel like I should be more excited.  I think I'm not looking forward to the actual traveling part.  All the packing, washing clothes, carrying luggage, checking in, waiting, waiting, waiting.  I'm so impatient.  I think it sucks I have to be here doing nothing at work while I have a million things to do at home.  I think I'm gonna ask to leave early.  Hmph. Maybe not.  It's cloudy again. It seems like it's cloudy every day.  It's cold too. 52.  Yesterday it was 80. I don't understand the midwest's weather.  I don't understand a lot of things.  I wish I had a job that I actually did stuff at, you know like carpenters or something. Something that didn't involve me sitting on my fat ass all day.  I swear to God, it gets bigger and bigger.  Not that Tony minds.  But I blame my slow metabolism on the fact I've been sitting on my ass 40 hours a week since I was 18.  Yeah, so I'd like to learn a trade.  I'm never gonna make a lot of money doing this.  I don't want to do this forever.  I'm getting bored.  Who does this shit their whole life?  OOOh, just got told to go home. SWEET. Guess the blogging was annoying.  later.

      Well, it's Friday and I couldn't be in a more depressed mood.  It feels like winter outside.  It looks like winter outside and I feel like I'm getting sick.  Ugh. I keep reading all this news about Iraq.  It's so hard to even think of what those people are going through, our soldiers, the iraqi people.  It's so hard to imagine that someone would cut someone else's head off.  I think there are purely evil people in this world and that those people who did that are evil.  I don't think it had anything to do with what the American soldiers were doing to those prisoners.  They would cut off any American's head just the same regardless if those pictures never got out.  They did it to that Wall Street Journal reporter a few years ago and there weren't any US Soldiers taking pictures of naked iraqies then.  Nope, they are just fucking crazy.  I believe that.  I don't condone what is being done to the people in those prisons and I think they're no better off now or protected by the Geneva Convention than they were under Sadaams hand.  I wonder why people are saying this war is over oil, yet gas prices are the highest they have ever been.  Maybe I'm just stupid but if it were over oil, don't you think our oil would be cheaper?  Something is very wrong.  I'm trying to think about what their lives must be like over there because I'd rather not think about mine anymore.  I get so wrapped up in my own drama and stupid little life that I take for granted everything I have.  I can walk down the street in a bathing suit if I wanted to.  But those women can't.  Those women can't do half of the things I do.  Those women could never talk to their husband the way I talk to Tony.  Anyway, I'm looking forward to going home.  I know I will miss Tony once I am gone, but I want to miss him.  I want him to miss me.  I wonder if he even will.  Last night I tried to have a serious talk with him but it seems impossible.  He doesn't take anything seriously.  It's pointless.  It's 2:43.  I have one hour and 17 minutes.  Traffic was horrible today.  Traffic baffles me.  If everyone would just go there would be no traffic. It's always some dip shit driving 10 miles an hour.  What I also don't understand is how in the hell do you get in a wreck when you're driving 10 miles an hour.  I actually saw one guy reading the paper the other day.  Reading the paper in traffic.  It seems to amaze me. I think Chicago made the top 10 list of horrible cities to drive in on the expressway and I get to take it everyday to work now.  I complain a lot.  Ooooh I just got e-mails. Finally something exciting happened. That's all.

      Our offices moved locations a few weeks ago.  We are sharing an office with this tool and stamp factory.  All day my office shakes from the stamping machines.  It's annoying.   It's been raining all week. There's something about this weather being warm and cloudy that I love.   I'm listening to David Gray.  My pants are too big today.  I'm gonna have lunch with Tony.  I will have to pay.  Because he doesn't have any money It's always this way.  This morning we got into an arguement over the shower.  He doesn't understand why he should have to get up earlier to take a shower and I don't.  Then he started talking about how I don't appreciate things.  He got mad because he has the little closet and I have the gigantic closet.  He told me I share two of his drawers, he should be able to share my closet.  Then he goes on to say I don't like to share anything.  The whole time I'm not even talking, just listening to his complaints. He rushes me to get out of the shower and then says that he makes me breakfast all the time and I don't appreciate it.  Then I lost it.  I said, he gets to sleep on the bed next to the fan while I sleep next to the wall.  And he never mops the floor or cleans the dishes after his breakfast or after      make dinner.  And I said how is what he does more important than what I do? He also leaves earlier than me in the morning so he should get up earlier.  I don't like to talk in the morning.  In fact, I'm down right a bitch if you talk to me too much.  I don't know why. He called me at work to apologize and to say he would get up earlier.  I get suspicious when he acts nice.  He hasn't snapped at me at all lately.  I think he is scared I will leave him.  I'm tired of these stupid little arguements.  Sexually, I haven't even been responsive lately.  I feel exhausted of the entire situation.  I feel like even if I start to think good of him again, he will do something to screw it up.  I have no hope for us anymore.  I'm tired of his lies.  Last night, all I could do was think of all the times he's lied to me.  It makes it really hard to sit next to someone and show them love when you feel like they don't even have enough respect for you to tell you the truth.  He says I love you.  But I wonder if he knows what love is.  When he tries to make things better I don't accept it because I know it is only temporary and as soon as things are okay with us again, it will be screwed up again.  This cycle keeps me unhappy at all times.  It's like he doesn't want me to be happy.  I want to be happy.   I leave for Dallas on Wednesday and a part of me wishes I could just stay and forget that I know anyone here.  I wish I could just forget for a while that any of this ever happened to me.

      Last night I had a great dream.  I dreamt I was in Florida with my family.  There were plam trees everywhere.  We were staying in somewhat of a dingy hotel and I was rushing back and forth between rooms to find my clothes and to take a shower.  Andy was sitting on the dresser just waiting.  When I was ready, I suddenly found myself on the beach and Ryan was playing a drum with two drumsticks and he was smiling and so happy.  There was music all around and I was happy.  This morning I was driving to work and the day started off well until I listened to the radio and I heard the news of the U.S. civilian Nick Berg and how he was killed.  I've thought about it all day.  I thought of it in my car in traffic and how his parents must feel and how they must have thought about how they could not help him.  I picked up the paper at lunch and it was on the front page of the Tribune.  I found it difficult to eat.  I sat there and thought about my freedom and how I can get in my car right now and drive to Texas to see my family if I wanted to.  I can't begin to fathom how helpless he must have felt.  My thoughts and prayers will be with his family tonight.

      I keep having these horrible dreams. Last night I dreamt we were having a party and I walked into the hallway and Tony was sitting in a circle full of girls and then I saw him lean over and give one of them a kiss.  I was furious in my dream.  I know what this dream means. I know it means I don't trust him.  I never have trusted him.  I don't trust anyone.  Add that to the list of things to chalk up to my childhood.  I have this weird thing about needing people but not really needing them.  Financially, I've never really needed the help of anyone and when it was offered I would not accept it.  I still don't.  Anytime I need to do anything or get anything done, I do it.  I rarely ask for anyone's help because I end up feeling like I owe them instead of them doing it as a nice gesture because they are my friend or something like that.  I hate thinking that I owe anyone anything and that vice versa anyone owes me anything.  But the weird thing is that emotionally, I always need someone.  If someone is not there feeding and fueling my emotions and determining my moods by the way they treat me, I feel empty.  I feel useless.  It's almost like I need someone to be there to serve no purpose other than to tell me they love me.  It sounds pathetic.  It is pathetic. Because essentially, if it was not for this one thing, I would not need anyone.  I mean, romantically that is.  I will always need friends.  But I find that when I am emotionally and romantically involved that I even neglect my friends.  I am spiritually void at this point.  And even though I know this, I won't do anything about it. Even though I want to do something about it, I won't.  Because I am too accustomed to this lifestyle.  This way, I don't have to think about myself or my goals.  This way I can project my negativity onto him and make everything his fault even though most of the time it is.  But over all, it is MY fault for letting it go on.  I am the only one to blame for my unhappiness and I learned this a long time ago.  I just wonder if I will live the rest of my life like this.  I wonder how long I will let it go on before I have a nervous breakdown or an identity crisis.  I wonder if I am crazy or if I am just over analyzing everything.  Anyway, here is the dream interpretation:  Cheating  To dream that your mate, spouse, or significant other is cheating on you, indicates your fears of being abandoned. You may feel a lack of attention in the relationship. Alternatively, you may feel that you are not measuring up to the expectations of others. This notion may stem from issues of trust or self-esteem. The dream could also indicate that you are unconsciously picking up hints and cues that your significant other is not being completely truth or is not fully committed in the relationship.

      Sounds like somebody's got a case of the MONDAY'S.  That's me.  I am not in a talkative mood this morning. Not like I ever am in the mornings anyway.  Last night I dreamt that I lived by the ocean.  I dreamt there was a horrible storm coming. A hurricane.  Everyone was evacuating the city.  You could see the sky changing to haunting colors of gray.  I knew it would be a bad storm.  Some people decided to stay.  I was one of the people.  We put tape on the windows and  mattresses up against them so the glass wouldn't shatter and hit us in the face.  The storm came and it blew away houses and you could see things flying all in air.  But I just took cover behind the mattress and everything blew over.  When it was over I walked outside and saw streaks of blue in the sky and the sun peaking through.  I went back inside the house and took a shower.  I looked this dream up this morning to find out the meaning.  This is what it said:  Storm  To see a storm in your dream, signifies overwhelming struggle, shock, devastating loss and catastrophe in your personal affairs. The storm also represents unexpressed fears or emotions, such as anger, rage, turmoil, etc. On a more positive note, the storm signifies the rising of spirit within.   To dream that you take cover in a storm, foretells that whatever disturbance or problems is occurring in your life will quickly blow over. Consider also the phrase "weather the storm", which suggests your ability and strength to withstand whatever comes.

      Hung over.  Look who found their way to the bar after all.  I had a great time. But I feel extremely thirsty this morning. Not sure exactly what I said when I got home but apparently I made a fool out of myself.  Tony and Ruben were sleeping on the couches at 8:30 and I woke them up by calling them lame asses.  Then I put on the James Brown CD.  That's about all I remember. I had bad dreams last night again about killing. I've been having these dreams all week.  Every night I have a dream where someone gets killed.  Last night I dreamt I had to cut my cat to get all these little 3" humans out of him to find out later that he had been shot.  Really bizarre.  Then there were these two crack heads trying to sell a Monticarlo that was all beat up for $250 and when I didn't want to buy it they tried to rob me and they were going to kill me.  Then Tony came and tried to save me.  He was running with me on his shoulders to get away from the crack heads.  We ended up on some deserted street with a lot of sand.  Don't know what the hell any of that means.

      May 5, 2004 Cinco De Mayo is not supposed to be a bad day.  You're supposed to drink margaritas and listen to spanish music in some local bar laughing at all the other drunk folk making fools out of themselves.  But today is the Cinco De Mayo from Hell.  I woke up this morning with a phone call from my landlord saying the apartment downstairs gas was off due to my lack of paying the bill before we moved out.  The people living there don't have hot water, heat, cooking gas. Nada.  This wouldn't be so bad if I moved to the other side of the city but I moved directly upstairs.  So now everyone hates us.  I can just imagine what they all must be thinking. These dirty non-paying bill MF-ER'S!  I spent a day and a half cleaning the apartment before they moved in and apparently it wasn't good enough so they called the owners about that too, at which point the owners hired a cleaner.  It's just a lot of unnecessary drama that could have been avoided if we didn't have to move out of the apartment as quickly as we did.  I hate being the bad guy.  Then I get to work to try to call the gas company and pay the $460 bill and they put me on hold for an hour the first time.  Then the second time I called back I was on hold for 22 minutes only so they could tell me to call another number to pay the bill and then call them back with the confirmation number.  You'd think the gas company made enough money off us suckers in the winter to hire enough people to answer the damn phone.  So...I got that accomplished thinking, okay, so now I only have $6.79 in my bank account.  Not enough to even buy a margarita.  Not to mention all the humiliation I feel.  I tried to do some work but it turns out since we are a new business here I have to rely on everyone else to get shit done.  I hate this.  People should be more organized.  Look at me complaining. I don't even pay my bills and I want people to be more organized.  I complain about Tony acting like a little kid, but so do I.  People my age should pay their bills on time.  I'm so disappointed in myself.  Maybe I have enough money to buy a 40 oz of Mickey's.  That will have to suffice. Bye.

      Tuesday May 4, 2004  It's cloudy.  I like writing on days that it's cloudy. Tony came home at 9:30 last night from work.  Well, he wasn't working.  Of course he was drunk.  I wouldn't even look at him. He didn't even call.  He took off his clothes, stripped down to his boxers, threw everything in the middle of the living room floor, laid down on the couch and stared at me.  I said "What?" He said "Don't you want to know where I have been?" And I said "No, cause whatever you say I know will be a fucking lie". And then I continued writing.  He continued staring.  So I looked at him again and said "What?" And he said "nothing" and looked away.  This is the part where I am supposed to feel bad because he is being nice.  Yeah right.  I just kept my mouth closed because I knew if I opened it, there would be nothing nice coming out.  Then the, "I'm sorry's and Oh baby, why are you over-reacting, and Jana please I don't want you to be mad at me" followed.  Tony is so consistent that even his I'm sorry's sound insincere.  I gotta get my computer hooked up to cable or dsl at home.  I did some writing yesterday to pass the time and the more I wrote the more I just wanted to not be in a relationship because I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to do to make me happy because I kept thinking about what was making me unhappy.  I just want my life to be very different all of a sudden.  I'm tired of a lot of things. One thing I've realized through out all my hardships is that I can do anything I want if I really want to. I'm tired of working for someone.  I think I'd rather work for myself.  I am still young and have the energy to do that.  I learned I can assist in getting a business up and running, and I can do sales if I want to and do it well, and I can move to another city and start a whole new life.  I can make friends in other states and go visit them there.  All you need is the desire and when you have someone who doesn't support you or motivate you or even have enough common decency to give you a fucking phone call, all it does is slow you down.  I'm just realizing I'm tired of dealing with bull shit. I'm tired of having a steady distraction.  Yes, my life is comfortable and I make a decent living, but I think if my life is like this in 10 years I might put a bullet in my head.  Morbid as it may seem, I don't think life is intended to be lived like this.  I don't think I should spend more time in an office making small talk with people I'm not that close to than out doing things to make myself a happier person.  Some people are driven by careers and money and those things have never been that important to me.  It's nice to have, that's all.  Other things are nice to have too is all I am saying. I sound like my ex.  I have respect for hard-working people. I am a hard working person.  I don't think I could live life without working so this is not meant to be taken out of it's context, these words I'm saying.  I'll put in some of my poetry in a little while.

      I spend a great deal of time alone these days doing nothing.  Well, that's not true. I've been reading a lot more than I ever have.  I keep buying books.  I do this though. I will buy a few books and read half of them and then never pick them up again.  I feel like the rest of America now because I got the internet at home again.  It's been over a year since I've had it.  This is good for me because I don't have to sit on the couch all day and watch TV, but then I realize I actually spend all day sitting in front of a computer.  If there were no computers I wonder what I would do.  I'm trying real hard not to be pissed off at Tony right now.  He called JB and Data over, said they were only going to come over to pick something up and ironically they brought a fifth of Hennessey and they each have a forty to drink.  Doesn't sound like it will be a short visit.  Now they have all left to go drop something off.  Something that should only take thirty minutes but will end up taking two hours and he will come home with some extravagant story about what happened but what really didn't happen.  I guess he keeps me enterained and that's why I am still here because when I start to think about myself I get bored.  I think I have become kind of a boring person.  The older I get the less spontaneous I am, the less frivilous I am, the less rowdy and joyful I am for some reason.  It's very hard not to smoke.  I want to smoke cigarettes but I can't be selfish anymore.  I found a whole bunch  of stuff I wrote a long time ago.  One of the poems made me cry.  I wrote it about Brad.  It's so weird because anytime I think about him long enough or am reminded of what we had in some way whether it be by a drawing I found of his or something he or I wrote or even an old picture, I just lose it.  I don't know why.  It's almost as if I believe I will never find love like that again.  I have not loved anyone as much as I loved him and no one will ever love me as much he did.  I look at Tony and I wonder how he even became a consideration.  I know that sounds horrible.  But I guess after time you settle?  Brad used to tell everyone that what we had was so special and that not many people find that kind of love or expierence what we did and I agree.  It was such a deep admiration and deep romance and strong connection that I often wonder how it was ever lost and taken for granted.  Just writing about it makes me cry. He made me feel so special and I think it was because he was so special.  All I know is that I have spent every day since the day we broke up looking for something as great.  And if you ever heard him talk about it, I think the last thing he said was, Baby we had problems.  And I think I hate the fact that it still bothers me on some level and that it doesn't ever even cross his mind.  He has so moved on.  When I went home last month I saw pictures of him and Bridgette in Europe and I was happy that he got to do that, cause he always wanted to, but I was jealous.  It's pathetic because it's been six fucking years.  But when I start thinking about my life, I think of how everything is this way because of a decision he made and that I agreed to because I loved him.  I think of all the friendships that have been harder to keep because I live here.  I think of every jerk I've met here who didn't give a rats ass about me.  I think about how I was practically homeless a couple of times and so lost that I still don't know if any decision I ever made was right.  I know that I am probably pointing my finger in the wrong direction right now, but if I had thought for myself for once in my life six years ago, none of this would be the way it is.  Not that it's a big regret.  I just often wonder if things would've been better if I never came here.

      I started to write about ugly people and pretty people and why some people are lucky and some are not.  But the truth is, I don't know why some people just have it better than others.  I can't figure out why everything in my life requires that I make some life altering decision and that in the process it also has to be extremely painful. I most of all don't understand myself and I think it's impossible to make decisions because of it.  I can't seem to do what's right for me. Last weekend I was out with Tony's mom and boyfriend Oscar and although Oscar was drunk, he kept telling me to be sneaky.  Oscar works with Tony.  I don't know what the hell he meant by that but it doesn't sound like my being sneaky will lead to anything good.  I'm sick and tired of checking up on Tony.  I'm tired of being so angry all the time.  When I am not around him I am mostly just melancholy and dazed about everything.  It's like I walk though life everyday not really ever seeing anything.  I close my eyes to everything around me because when I start paying attention to what's really going on I become very upset.  I don't think you are supposed to feel this way when you're pregnant.  I always thought that everything would be happy.  But it's not.  I am miserable.  I hate Tony.  I don't think he will be a good father.  I think he will always be a selfish asshole.  I would truthfully love to do this by myself but I don't know if I have the srength.  I know that sounds horrible but I don't want to be with him anymore.  He is very bad for me.  His words are insincere.  He says one thing but does another.  He continues to lie and hide things.  I can't be with someone who is so secretive.  I can't continue on bitching about this though.  I have to shit or get off the pot.  I have to accept it and move on or not.  I have done so well accepting up to this point but I just feel so angry and betrayed all the time.  I worry everyday that I will just fuck up this kids life because of my stupid decision to have a child with him.  I havnen't really talked to anyone about this.  I cry everyday.  I have tried to kick him out of the house but then I change my mind because I know I would sit there alone and go crazy.

      I am finally moved!  I am upstairs now with normal people who don't mind if I type.  I have my privacy now and it's great!  If i come in at 8:03, no one cares.  No one will even give a shit.  This is fabulous.  Fucking fabulous.

      Once again it's been a while. Once I move over to the other office I'll be able to update this more.  It's impossible to do with Tim sitting right there because as soon as I start typing he instataneously give me the "what the fuck are you doing because it's not work" look.  As if I have work to do.  As if I would sit here and blog when I had shit to do.  Whatever.  Well, ever since the day I have found out I was pregnant, (yes, pregant), each day has been different with new worries about how I will afford it, who will watch this child while I'm at work.  Questions like, why am I even having a child in this city, is Tony going to grow up and act like an adult in the next 9 months, will he even be able to help me out with the cost of this?  Then there's, will I be a good mom, will I screw up this kids life?  I don't see myself with Tony forever.  I just don't.  He continually stresses me out.  Ever since he found out about this though he's been extremely nice and giving.  I love him, but I feel that with him parts of myself are neglected.  He is not an open person, does openly discuss his feelings or is ever very serious about anything at all.  How will he condition a child to be normal? I feel like we are such different individuals.  I never wanted a child in this city.  But now I am face to face with it.  I am not getting married.  We didn't have any plans to get married before this happened, so I don't intend on doing it now.  I know that now I am going to be here a lot longer than I anticipated.  I am doing okay at work and I know that now that I will be upstairs with the rest of the accounting people and working for Rosa, things will definitely get a lot better here.  It's very flexible and I know there are more opportunities to make more money now.  I opened my big mouth about selling corner guards and truthfully I don't want to do sales anymore.  I never really liked it in the first place.  I was trying to make a point simply that I made more money doing sales because of the comission and that I haven't had an increase in salary in over two years because of it.  But now that I am doing office work again, I hardly think my salary is enough.  I was fishing for a raise not sales.  Oh well.  Anyway, I get angry very easily and I cry very easily because I worry about everything.  I wonder if I can afford to be off work for two weeks let alone six.  Even if Tony and I put $50 a week into a savings account, I still don't know if it will be enough to hold it down for six weeks and after that, what happens?  I dont know anyone here with children.  I don't know anyone who baby sits.  I know it's not healthy to stress out over this but who else will?  How will things get done unless I do them?  I want so much for Tony to pull through and for me to be able to depend on him and not feel so alone.  He tries to be comforting and while I need that, I also need to feel secure.  I need for him to pay his bills when they are due, and I need for him to save money and make me feel like we can do this together and not so much like I'm doing it alone.  Right now, he is so behind on his shit that I am paying for everything. I am paying all the utilities, and last month I paid 75% of Rent.  Granted, he will pay me back but that is besides the point.  You can't tell a four month old to hold off on pissing because daddy can't buy diapers.  Anyway, hopefully things will get better and become a little more clearer within the next few months.  I hope.  I hope. I hope.

      I am about to seriously walk out of my job. I am so fed up with Tim.  I am so tired of all the "stupid" comments.  If it happens one more time, I will WALK THE FUCK OUT.

      It's been a while since my last post. It's hard to type when my boss is here because he knows I am not working and he thinks I am e-mailing my friends.  Why would it bother someone if I was typing?  It bothers me when his computer clicks. The monitor just clicks. My friend Natalie got us tickets to see Amel Larrieux in concert last night at the House of Blues.  She sings with so much truth.  Her voice is amazing.  I cried when she sang Make me whole.  She is such a beautiful and positive person.  I have felt so good all day since that concert despite the fact that I am hung over and tired as hell.  I had a really good time.  I've started going to the gym again too.  It's finally nice outside.  It's been sunny the last couple of days and it's beginning to really warm up.  The may fest is this weekend.  I'm going to go to that but I'm sure there will be no parking around my house for the next few days.  I've had three dreams about Brad this week.  I don't think they necessarily have anything persay to do with Brad, but the dreams messages have a lot to do with how I perceive things right now in my waking life.  There are a lot of changes I need to make because I am definitely on the brink of depression.  I find so many things to be happy about but as soon as I get around Tony I become mega bitch.  I just feel it with everything I have that he has been so wrong to me and done things that I will never know about.  He is so secretive and on top of that he is a liar.  I find that I can go out and have a great time now and not even miss him but in the back of my mind I worry about what he's doing.  Something has to change soon.  If not with him then definitely with me.  I've waited for things to get better for too long.  Work has really been bothering me too.  It's not so much the work I do or the people I am around, but that I feel like there is more to life than this.  I feel like I should be experiencing all that I can right now while I still have the energy.  I know most people at this point in there life are beginning their careers or finishing graduate school or something awesome like that but I don't want to work for someone else my whole life.  I want to do something extraordinary.  I want to set my mark in this world and leave it with class and dignity.  I want to be remembered for more than the girl who did the accounting for 40 years.  I have this desire to be something and take control and live free.  I think I am the kind of person that hates to stay in one place too long.  But the ironic thing is that for so long I have tried to create this stable life where the people around me are the same and my residence is the same address and my job is the same, etc....But I find that unless things change, all of these things and places become unhappy places to be.  If I'm not growing and I'm learning anything, what am I doing?  Nothing.  Nothing at all.  What's the point in that?  Well, it's about that time.  Over and out.

      Not much has changed.  Every day is still the same.  I don't know why I just didn't let my dad come up here because I would be leaving this hell hole right now instead of sitting here writing about why I am still here and how much it fucking sucks.  Another Saturday turned to shit today when we were on our way to Ikea and why?  All because I took my keys out of the car at Shell instead of leaving it running so Tony didn't have to be hot while he waited a whole two fucking minutes for me to come back to the car.  I didn't even do it on purpose but because I did something so stupid I got the third degree and that turned into me driving 60 mph down Foster straight back to the house and almost getting into three wrecks on the way.  I sat in the kitchen after it all happened and have been thinking about how different my life could be.  I think about this all the time though.  I look out the window and imagine a better life.  I close my eyes and I can see happiness but it never includes Tony.  This is not love and it hasn't been for a long time but this fucking game continues for some reason.  I can safely say I have lost myself in all this.  I don't know if I have ever been this unhappy with a person.  There is not one day that goes by that we don't argue and fight over something trivial.  It's only a matter of time until something huge happens again and what will I do?  Believe Tony's lies again that things will be different?  I want to believe that things can be different so badly that I let things continue on with the hope they will, but they never do.  I want a normal life so badly but I think I have to face the fact that will never happen with him.  Never.  I can't continue investing time in something and someone who is unable to and incapable of giving.  I have tried to change my ways to try to make this work but nothing matters.  Does he enjoy this?  Does he like living like this?  I have to wonder because everytime I am ready to leave him he pleads with me not to.  Although his attempts aren't even that sincere I still stay.  I have tried lately to think of good things about him so that I don't always think of him this way, but I can't do that when he continually fucks it up.  He has ruined everything.  I'll write more later.

      I was standing outside this ethiopian restaruant that I had dinner at last night with a couple of friends and I was looking around at the city.&nbsp; I was trying to remember why I fell in love with it. I was remembering what has kept me here.&nbsp; It has always been my need for independence and a different life from that which I came.&nbsp; It was my desire to grow in a different enviornment and to be self sufficient.&nbsp; It was my love of diversity and new people and more than anything all of the inspiration I felt just by merely stepping outside of my house or riding the el or walking downtown.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt all of that last night as I stared down the street at the cabs and cubs fans in wrigleyville.&nbsp; And then I realized that&nbsp;all of those ambitions and dreams of having a different life aren't at all the way I thought they would be by now.&nbsp; I realized that although I am here amoung all of these things, museums, architecture, musicians, and an old with city with more character than I know what do with, that I have created a life exactly like the one I&nbsp;tried to escape.&nbsp; I have met a man that acts just like my father and I've created a home that&nbsp;is just as unhappy now as it was when I was sixteen.&nbsp; Ten years later and I am back at square one, only I'm in the drivers seat now.&nbsp; The question I keep asking myself is do I want to be someone my child looks up to or someone my child resents?&nbsp; And the answer is easy.&nbsp; Never before has any decision or answer been easier.&nbsp; I have battled with&nbsp;making decisions my whole life never knowing if I made the right choice or not but this one is the first one that I don't have to think twice about.&nbsp; I know what I have to do and it will require more strength than I probably know I even possess but I&nbsp;want to be a good mother.&nbsp; I want to be&nbsp;happy mother and I want my child to be inspired and have room to&nbsp;grow and with Tony around,&nbsp; that will never happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have slowly begun to shut him out of my life.&nbsp; I have slowly begun to shut down and he's trying to do things that before would hurt me and send me running scared right back to him but I have decided to let him go.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've decided to be cold and I've given him a lot of opportunities to avoid this and I tried to warn him of it.&nbsp; This is what I do.&nbsp; I no longer feel love and because of that I am no longer able to give it.&nbsp;

      I should really post more.&nbsp; This whole format looks different.&nbsp; I've been pretty sad lately.&nbsp; Everything makes me sad.&nbsp; TV shows about happy couples make me sad.&nbsp; You know, even the stupid yet can't quite stop watching it show like Newlyweds makes me sad.&nbsp; I lay in bed at night, (and lately it's been alone cause I make Tony sleep on the couch and use the excuse that I'm pregnant and am uncomfortable&nbsp;with him there even though I think he's starting to catch on that it might be more than that) and I remember what it felt like to be in love.&nbsp; I remember what sharing my life with someone meant.&nbsp; I remember what it felt like to be able to talk to someone without being angry.&nbsp; I notice when I am at work or with friends or doing something I like without Tony, I am fine.&nbsp; But when I am home alone or with him there, I am not okay.&nbsp; Last night he said I love you and he then asked me if I knew that he loved me and I said no.&nbsp; I said no, I don't know that.&nbsp; And he got really mad and said that was fucked up of me to say and asked why I said it.&nbsp; I told him that he has hurt me very badly in the last&nbsp;two years&nbsp;and sometimes I don't understand how he could love me because the way he acts shows no sign of love, only selfishness.&nbsp; I told him I often feel like he doesn't want to be with me and then he said all I had to say about him was a bunch of bad shit so why do I want to be with him?&nbsp; And I said I guess I'm stupid because I keep giving you chances to do the right thing but you just keep fucking me over and everytime you do that, it pushes me further away and that it's like a video game, like Mortal Kombat where you just keep beating the shit out of someone until they can't take it anymore and that's it.&nbsp; The games over.&nbsp; I told him I've had enough of his games and that it makes me feel better to be cold and distant than to act like I love him right now because I always end up getting hurt.&nbsp; But this is no way to be.&nbsp; I told him that I know he will never change.&nbsp; He will always thinks of himself first&nbsp;and will&nbsp;have his secret life and his lock code on his phone and all these mysterious friends at work and a bunch of bullshit really.&nbsp; I told him that if he thinks I am stuck with him now because I am pregnant that he is wrong.&nbsp; But I do feel stuck.&nbsp; I'm not selfish like he is and because of that I will always get the short end of the deal with him.&nbsp; I told him I don't have to fuck him and I don't have to kiss him and that when I feel in love I will be affectionate, but until then the bed's gonna be pretty cold so what difference does it make if he sleeps on the couch or not.&nbsp; He used to love to sleep on the couch and it used to bother me that he did.&nbsp; But now I prefer he did and just leave me alone and now he hates that.&nbsp; He told me that I've gotten too used to him not sleeping with me and that sooner or later I will just get used to him not being around so much that I won't even want him around, so now he insists on sleeping in the bed.&nbsp; When I came back from Texas in May there was a condom missing from the drawer by the bed and my ralph lauren perfume was gone.&nbsp; Who would still a girls perfume?&nbsp; I just can't forget that.&nbsp; The other day I swear he smelled like sex when he came home.&nbsp; I find him disgusting now.&nbsp; I know this is all horrible of me to say because I am carrying his child and my mom says I shouldn't talk bad about him because it's the devils way of trying to fuck things up.&nbsp; But I don't think it has anything to do with that.&nbsp; I think Tony's done a good job of fucking things up on his own.&nbsp; I cry because I want to be in love.&nbsp; I want to share this expierence with someone I truly love.&nbsp; I have thought of Brad a lot lately and I cry about that.&nbsp; I think I have figured something out though.&nbsp; Since Brad and I split, I have done nothing but date men that treat me like shit and I realized that I am punishing myself because I blame myself for every bad thing that ever happened between he and I and that in some fucked up way I think I don't deserve real love.&nbsp; It's why I have never given Drew a real chance.&nbsp; I know I could love Drew the way I loved Brad and the same vice versa and because I know that I think I would just fuck it up too so it has always been best to just be something I imagine would be great and leave it at that.&nbsp; There's this song by John Mayer called comfortable and I can't stop listening to it.&nbsp; It's a great song and it also makes me cry.&nbsp; I'll write more later.&nbsp;
