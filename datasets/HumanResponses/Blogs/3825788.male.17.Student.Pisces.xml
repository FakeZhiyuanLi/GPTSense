      Cheating...  Why do people do it? I mean if they aren't happy with their boyfriend/girlfriend, they should break up with that person. If they aren't happy with their spouse that means they either rushed into marriage or just didn't do a good job picking a person that they would spend their LIFE with.  If you're scared of commitment/future/past/anything involving the person you're marrying, DON'T GET MARRIED! I mean damn, it's just common sense people.  Now there are the people who cheat on a boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse cuz it gives them a "rush." Bad idea guys. I mean come on, we're not 14 here, well some of us are, but that's not the point. it you want a rush, try something that won't hurt anyone besides yourself. Skydiving or bull riding are excellent examples of adrenaline junkies.  [And paintball! -Ed.]   Then you have the people who "just can't seem to help it." these people should never enter into serious relationships with boys/girls/dogs until they mature a lil bit. I'm sorry, but "I couldn't hep it" is not a valid excuse, you can always help it.  I'm just losing hope in people in general. I am starting to doubt I will ever find a nice girl who WON'T cheat on me. I've been surrounded by cheaters my whole life, and it's not a good feeling to have growing up/living with.  In short, I hope I am lucky enough to find a girl who will stay as faithful to me as I will be to her.  thank you for baring with me through all of my /'s and general ranting.

       well, still no news on the car situation. I guess no news it good news though. at least you don't have to pay for no news. it's free, like public television.    &nbsp;  in other news, I want to be this guy when I grow up!       &nbsp;

       My car broke down today! Everything is all backwards! I'm not having very good luck with anything besides girls! It's not supposed to work that way! My car was working just fine last night, and then all of the sudden today BAM! Overheat in the face!       On a lighter note, I'm eating a blueberry muffin and it is good.       More updates as they develop.

      well, the situation is worse than I had originally thought. not only is my hard drive not working correctly, it's dead! no, hard drives can't die... IT WAS MURDERED! so yeah, my computer is dead til at least saturday. I get paid friday, and won't have time to go get a new hard drive til, at the earliest, saturday.  oh well, I'm sure I'll live, I'll just have to talk to people the old fashioned way, by telephone...

       well, I'm gonna have to reformat my hard drive today... great fun. I also have to work, so I probably won't get to do it til tonight. oh well, shyte happens.    on a lighter note, I got to spend 5 straight hours with Ariel yesterday. that was awesome. we went to church, then lunch then just hung out at the mall for awhile. then I went out and did some stuff with some friends and called her up when I got home.    oh well, good things happen and bad things happen, I guess it all comes down to how you handle them. don't ask me what that means, cuz I couldn't tell you. it just sounded cool in my head...

      BLASPHEMY!    I just thought I'd keep you all posted on what's going down, which so far, is nothing.  I'm pretty much just really bored, sitting around, wearing nothing but gym shorts, while think I might wanna maybe mow the lawn.    I don't wanna mow the lawn.    -Justin

       yeah, I'm still here, havn't posted in awhile, but I am still here. not much to say, other than the summer is looking up! but it's also not so great at the same time.    me and my friends are getting closer to each other and bonding a lot, but the girls are still giving me problems. that's all I'm gonna say about that. I promised no more pity parties, and I intend to keep that promise.    and now I will leave ya'll with something to give ya'll a lil morning wood to sport for awhile...

        Give her some space.      Look, if you seriously screw up when trying to make her realize how you feel, and how much you care, I'm quite certian (as in, have no clue and am just hoping I'm right) that you should give the person you feel affectionately towards some time away from you. If things don't work out, but be friends, especially if thats what she wanted in the first place and you were to much of a selfish dumbass to realize that her talking to you at all is a miracle. She can stay mad as long as she wants, but I sure hope it's not forever. Just hope that she talks to you again, and hope that ths time you don't screw things up. You may want to tell her how you feel, to tell her that she's the one you want to share your first dance, kiss, drive-in movie with, but you'll probably just freak her out more.  Just give her some time.    And you should also hope and pray she doesn't read your blog.      G'night readers, I need some sleep.

        Don't Press The Issue.      I am an idiot. The more I think about it, the more I realize exactly how painful hindsight is. I'm quite certain I just ruined any miniscule chance I had with who is quite possibly the nicest, smartest, most beautiful girl in the world. Why? Because I pursued an issue I shouldn't have. It would've kept me from sleeping at night, but I shouldn't have asked her the question I did. It was rude an incondiderate. Don't make the same mistake I did, because no one deserves to feel uncomfortable, and no one deserves to feel as bad as I do, even though I earned it myself. Don't follow in my footsteps. Don't screw with your own head because of someone you're quite certain you need. Please.

         Don't overanalyze things.         Overanalysis.  I do it, alot, and I find that it sometimes makes me so mad that I could run through Kennewick down to Lucas' house just to complain to him how torqued I am.  You'll find more grief than satisfaction if you try to look to deep into things.  Sometimes, when the girl you like hugs you, you might think to yourself, "Was that a 'later, pal' hug; Or was it a 'Bye, hun' hug?"        DON'T.       You'll obsess over it and wind up miserable, because no matter how certain you think you are, you will always have doubt.  So, don't worry about it.  Take it as a hug, and nothing more.     Oh, and don't try to understand an ambiguous comment made by a female.  You'll never understand what they mean, and end up in a state of mental wreck, praying God will smite you so you can ask him what she meant by, "You are really cool."   Trust me, you'll never understand women.  Don't try.    That's all for our first installment.    -Dake

      well, as of late, I have a new obsession (according to dake... but he think I obsess over everything) CKY and Bam Margera. nuff said. if you havn't checked out the CKY videos, I highly recommend them, as well as the full length motion picture "Haggard." they are works of art and some of the most beautiful creations I have ever seen (aside from females and most sports cars.) WARNING! there is some MALE nudity. if you are easily offended, I cannot recommend that you watch these movies! Be forewarned! &nbsp; anyways, it's good to be back after my last blog attempt failed miserably, and I hope this one turns out better than the last. pics coming soon! I plan to "antique" a friend of mine on an upcoming trip to seattle...

      Well, this is the new blog.  Brolin will be on here as soon as I get around to inviting him.  I might also add that Haggard is one of the better movies I've seen in quite some time.    -Dake

      Well, I've had a terrible week.  Somewhat.  This week has been kinda slow, but kinda fast, if you know what I mean. The LAN party was awesome, met some cool guys, watched Initial D, ate 4 McChickens. I also pushed a shopping cart into some guy's car at 12:30 AM, but that's another story for another time. Actually, that's pretty much all there is to the story. We were screwing around, I tried to push a shopping cart into one of the receptacles for shopping carts, it curved, and hit a car. Hard. Luckily, there was no damage to the car.  Fast foreward to later in the week, I don't remember when, Brolin and I are in a pool with Mike and 2 girls. Go on like this for about 6 hours, add a thunderstorm, pissed parents, and girls trying to get me to dance to Sum41. This was my... Thursday?  Friday at 3:00 I took my final driver's ed drive.  Apparently, I am a champion parallel parker.  Today has blown hardcore. Everyone is out of town, or broke their ankle (DAMN YOU LUCAS!). I woke up 11 hours ago, and I'm tired again. boating tomorrow, which means more of me looking like this:     I guess my week hasn't sucked at all.  More pics tomorrow.
