      Hey People!!  I just got back from visiting my family in Birmingham.  It was great to see everyone -- especially my little niece Anne.  Here are a couple of pictures for ya to see.       These were taken on Anne's first visit to the Birmingham Zoo.  For that matter, probably the first trip to any zoo.  I was amazed at how good the zoo looks now.  They have this whole kids section that is really cool and includes a petting zoo.  The best part, though, was seeing the alligators.  There is this pond that is just covered in a thick layer of alge -- it literally looked like it was solid ground.  There was one alligator that you would have missed if you didn't look hard enough at the green-alge water.  Just its eyes and nose were sticking up out of the water.    Well, last night I went to see Shrek 2 and it is great!  I thought that it was a few time better than the previous movie.  I also go to see Troy and it was cool too.  I was actually surprised by the acting in it.  Brad Pitt really plays his character well.  Overall a movie worth seeing if you have the time; it is 2h45 long.    Ok, I need to go get something to eat with Joy.  I may try to post more later...  Cya.

      I have decided to try out the Blogger website to start blogging.  Overall this is a much nicer interface than Xanga and it has really given me some good web design ideas.  So, in a few hours I go to my first class for the Small Business development.  I'm a little scared because I feel like I am going to find out that it is going to be much more difficult than what I am willing to get myself into at this time.  We will see, though.  Well, let's see how this first post looks on the site.

      It's amazing what dreams can do... you know, those really intense dreams that you don't want to wake up from.  What is equally amazing is how much they can impact your mood when you are awake.  It was one of those kinda of dreams this morning for me... the kind where you think that you should get therapy after you wake up.  Scarry isn't it?  Anyway, I am going to post more later, I just was thinking about this stupid dream and wondering if really there is anything that I can do about it.  Later...

      Well, I think I might have finally won the war with my linux computer.  I had bought a new case for it but the case I got is really horrible.  I had to make some cutting modifications inorder for some of the peripheral cards to fit in.  There are other things wrong with it, but they would take to long to explain.  After may hours of trying to track down why the computer would powerup by not display anything on the screen I finally figure out that is was something to do with both the floppy drive cable and the CD-RW drive.  All in all, it is fixed and put together.  Now I just have to worry about the rest of this office.  I so want everything to be put in their places but to be able to get to them if I need them.  I imagine that I am going to go on a search tomorrow for a simple table that I put inbetween my desk and the bookshelf.  I want it high enough to put over the three computers and then on top of it I will put my photo printer and my scanner if it eventually gets here.  I also want to find some kind of wire, pull out shelves to put inside my desk so I can organize the space in there.  Anyway, there are so many things around this apartment that I want to do, but I have to just keep focused on one thing so that I can complete it and move on to the next.  I have a bad habit of starting something and not finishing it.  Speaking of finishing things, I need to finish the Psychology website that I have started.  I would be cool to get that done by the end of this week.  I will have some time for that when Joy goes off to do the Harry Potter thing with here people.  Anyway, enough for now and hopefully this computer can stay up for a while now.

      Well, I had my cable modem go out on me today.  It started making this high-pitched noise and would randomly stop working.  The thing wasn't even a year old and is probably still in warranty but I don't want to have to mess with all that kinda stuff.  The one I had was a Toshiba and now I have a Motorola.  It seems to be working quite well so far.  I am still peeved, though, over my netgear router.  This one was given to me, but I will never by anything netgear ever.  It has been a long time with the problems and they could be fixed with the correct software on the router, but netgear is dragging their feet.    Anyway, it is kinda strange trying to adjust to Lubbock again.  I still have not heard anything from the tech job that I interviewed for.  I was hoping he would reply to the email that I sent today.  Anyway, I need to get on to some other computing things.  I finally fixed my primary linux computer and it was all user error related problems.  I had a cable in the wrong way.  Anyway, I would like to finish this website for the clinical department.  Have a goodn'.

      I just don't get this Spring Framework.  Supposedly, it follows along some of the same actions as Struts as far as form submittion, but I just can't make it work.  I haven't been able to find any resources that clearly explain how to do form submittion using the Spring MVC yet.  I am thinking of getting the MERP version of Spring Live but looking at the demo applications that he has on the website for the book, I am not convinced that he really knows the correct way either.   If anyone actually reads this and can provide some good resources on form sumbittion using Spring MVC I would sure appreciate it.  I have been struggling with this for a long time now and it is getting really frustrating...

      Watched Down To You for the 50th time tonight mainly because I have been thinking about Meghan all day pretty much.  I can't really figure out why to be honest.  It is like an addiction that I haven't been able to get over yet.  I just wish that things between us were different.  In the back of my mind I know that they can't and that that is probably the best thing, but still for once can't it be like the movies!!!!  Whenever I get into this state of mind I tend to stay there for a while which is why I am listening to the Avril cd on my ipod.  "I don't forget you, oh its so sad...  I hope you can hear me... 'cause I remember it clearly... the day you slipped away, was the day I found it won't be the same...  I didn't get around to kiss you goodbye on the hand.... I wish that I could see you again... I know that I can't... I miss you"  Anyway, it seems that doing this is the only way that I can vent my frustration... I just don't feel happy in these times.  It is a combination of things and I know that whatever I say and whatever I do nothing is going to change.  And while you may consider that I am going to need thearpy for the rest of my life, sometimes people can have that kind of effect on someone.  Forgive please this moment of complete insanity... I temporarily have forgotten what it is that I have been doing to keep myself focused on what is more important that these absurd feelings.  I wish that there was something that she could do to help, but the only thing would be that she could possibly feel the same about me... and that is just not going to happen... ever... And who could blame her because of me writing stuff like this... I mean, let's just face it, I am still obsessed with her.  Granted that I don't think about her all the time.  All that I have to hope for is to someday be able to see her again and to spend some time with her.  I keep thinking of all that I did wrong and all that I do wrong with writing stuff like this and it really pains me.
