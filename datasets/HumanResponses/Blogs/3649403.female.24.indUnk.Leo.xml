      I am super excited that I am 4 months pregnant today with our sweet twins.  In a little more than a month we will find out the sex of the babies.  Right now we are in the process of trying to find a place to live that will be big enough for the twins & all the stuff that comes along with babies.  We found a great house to rent.  Please pray that God will provide for us financially to be able to break our current lease and pay for the security deposit at a new place.  We also need to pray that he'll provide for us month to month as the rent will be more than we planned on.

      This has been a good weekend.  Although, Friday night during our date night I got sick for the 1st time in 3 weeks.  We left the restuarant and headed to Blockbuster.  It was pouring and on our way home I made Dustin pullover and I stood out in the pouring rain.  It was not so good.  But I have felt better since then.  Yesterday we spent time looking at some apts.  We found one we like but its about 15 minutes out of town.  Dustin would really like to stay closer to the college.  Last night I cooked a feast and we had 2 of the interns over for dinner.  So far today, Sunday, has been a great lazy day.  I love lazy days!!!

      My biggest question these days is when do I get to feel the babies.  I am so excited and can't wait.  Everyday I wonder, "Is today the day??"  It's still early to feel the babies, but for some reason I just think I will feel them early.  I found out a couple days ago that we find out the sex of the babies a week later than I have been expecting.  We won't find out until Aug. 2 & that will also be my next ultrasound with the good machine.  I hope that we can talk them into some more 3-D pics of the babies.  I like those!!!!!!!!!!

      Today I am 14 weeks pregnant and everything seems to be going good.  I haven't gotten sick in almost 2 weeks and my stomach is definitely getting bigger.  I haven't gained back the 4 lbs. I originally gained, but I am sure that will come soon.  I don't think I have another Dr. appt. for 1 month.  That will be the longest I have waited between appts.  If I can figure out how to I am going to post pictures of me and the ultrasound pictures on this blog.  Keep checking and I will keep y'all updated.  Lori

      OK I know that everybody is excited our big day to find out the sex of the babies is on Monday at 1:15.  The appointment probably won't be over till 4:00.  So I'll post the news as soon as I know.  Check back here on Monday night to find out.  We are really excited!  Oh and I felt the babies move.  Just for a second but I'm pretty sure it was them.  Still no kicking but there is a little moving.  Bye, Lori

      Today I had a check-up at the Dr.'s office.  We got to here both of the babies heartbeats and that was great.  I feel so much better to hear their heartbeats and know that they're doing OK.  I have a belly, but I've only gained 6 lbs.  The Dr. said that I should start eating ice cream every night.  Sounds good to me!  We have our big ultrasound on Aug. 2 and I can hardly wait.  My mom will be here and she is gonna go with us.  We will find out the sex of both of the babies.  We already started our registries at Target and Babies R' Us, but then we'll be able to pick out more specific things.  Oh, I am still waiting to feel the babies.  It should be really soon.

      Yesterday we enjoyed the fireworks show by the river here in New Brunswick.  While we were there we passed out water to other people in the community.  I was talking to one couple and they said it looked like I was eating for 2 and I said 3.  I was pretty excited because people don't really small talk here.  I was happy!!    Now I am kinda freaking out though because its been at least 2 or 3 weeks since I've had an appointment.  It'll be 1 more week until I have an appointment.  I don't know why but I get scared in between appointments.  I love to hear their heartbeats and know that they are doing OK.  I am still waiting to feel them move the first time.  Tomorrow July 6, I will be 17 weeks pregnant.  That is 4 months and 1 week.  Any ways keep checking the site and I'll keep updating it.  Lori

      Well we went and had an ultrasound today.  We found out that we're having 2 girls.  I was blown away.  I was just sure that we had at least one boy, but I was wrong.  2 girls I can't believe it.  It's gonna be crazy but, we are excited.  Now I get to go back to the baby stores and pick out girl stuff.  That's gonna be fun.  I guess we'll be seeing a lot of pinks & purples.  I think I am gonna lean towards more of the purple stuff.  Well we are excited to tell the world.  We have 2 girl names picked out but until we are 100% I am gonna keep one of them a secret.  Dustin and I need a chance to make sure that we're 100%.  One of the names I am sure about is Cameron Nicole Walker.  One weighs 14 oz. and the other is 15 oz.  Everything looks good, the doctor couldn't really see the details of the heart so she wants me to come back for another ultrasound.  Both of the babies have strong heartbeats.  We got to see the feet and hands and everything looks normal.  I will be 21 weeks tomorrow.  So I am 5 months and 1 week.  Well hopefully everybody is excited to hear the news.
