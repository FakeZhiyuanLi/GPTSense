      We have to learn there is more to all of this existance then one deminsion and people coming and going. We need to learn how to help each other on levels that we cant see or feel.  So I have felt that a website as this seems to be the only ability to reach a wide varity of people, focus on a community or a unity people front.We can help each other and what we have forgotten is a little from all is alot.  I am utlising this media at the moment to review the responese I recieve as the people that I have been able to discuss this site with welcome it with open arms , but I want to here from as many as possible. This will not determine whether it will go ahead because it is but more help in some of the development of it.  Ghandi said "be the change you want to see" Well I would like to focus on the changes and unite a communities directions and changes.  I hope that this has given a little back ground of me and the direction of the site I will be adding to this with some ideas. And thoughts that have come our discussions here!!!!

      Then just to cap it off she drove me to my parents place giving them no notice and left me standing out side to be found. Any way another lesson and might I say harsh lesson was being delt.   Matt start listening.      Amazing grace, how sweet the sound...Â So begins one of the most beloved hymns of all times, a staple in the hymnals of many denominations, New Britain or Â45 on the topÂ in Sacred Harp. The author of the words was John Newton, the self-proclaimed wretch who once was lost but then was found, saved by amazing grace.  Newton was born in London July 24, 1725, the son of a commander of a merchant ship which sailed the Mediterranean. When John was eleven, he went to sea with his father and made six voyages with him before the elder Newton retired. In 1744 John was impressed into service on a man-of-war, the H. M. S. Harwich. Finding conditions on board intolerable, he deserted but was soon recaptured and publicly flogged and demoted from midshipman to common seaman.  Finally at his own request he was exchanged into service on a slave ship, which took him to the coast of Sierra Leone. He then became the servant of a slave trader and was brutally abused. Early in 1748 he was rescued by a sea captain who had known John's father. John Newton ultimately became captain of his own ship, one which plied the slave trade.  Although he had had some early religious instruction from his mother, who had died when he was a child, he had long since given up any religious convictions. However, on a homeward voyage, while he was attempting to steer the ship through a violent storm, he experienced what he was to refer to later as his Âgreat deliverance.Â He recorded in his journal that when all seemed lost and the ship would surely sink, he exclaimed, ÂLord, have mercy upon us.Â Later in his cabin he reflected on what he had said and began to believe that God had addressed him through the storm and that grace had begun to work for him.  For the rest of his life he observed the anniversary of May 10, 1748 as the day of his conversion, a day of humiliation in which he subjected his will to a higher power. ÂThroÂ many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come; Âtis grace has broÂt me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home.Â He continued in the slave trade for a time after his conversion; however, he saw to it that the slaves under his care were treated humanely.  In 1750 he married Mary Catlett, with whom he had been in love for many years. By 1755, after a serious illness, he had given up seafaring forever. During his days as a sailor he had begun to educate himself, teaching himself Latin, among other subjects. From 1755 to 1760 Newton was surveyor of tides at Liverpool, where he came to know George Whitefield, deacon in the Church of England, evangelistic preacher, and leader of the Calvinistic Methodist Church. Newton became WhitefieldÂs enthusiastic disciple. During this period Newton also met and came to admire John Wesley, founder of Methodism. NewtonÂs self-education continued, and he learned Greek and Hebrew.  He decided to become a minister and applied to the Archbishop of York for ordination. The Archbishop refused his request, but Newton persisted in his goal, and he was subsequently ordained by the Bishop of Lincoln and accepted the curacy of Olney, Buckinghamshire. NewtonÂs church became so crowded during services that it had to be enlarged. He preached not only in Olney but in other parts of the country. In 1767 the poet William Cowper settled at Olney, and he and Newton became friends.  Cowper helped Newton with his religious services and on his tours to other places. They held not only a regular weekly church service but also began a series of weekly prayer meetings, for which their goal was to write a new hymn for each one. They collaborated on several editions of Olney Hymns, which achieved lasting popularity. The first edition, published in 1779, contained 68 pieces by Cowper and 280 by Newton.    Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound) That savÂd a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now I see.  ÂTwas grace that taught my heart to fear, And grace my fears relievÂd; How precious did that grace appear, The hour I first believÂd!  ThroÂ many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come; ÂTis grace has brought me safe thus far, And grace will lead me home.  The Lord has promisÂd good to me, His word my hope secures; He will my shield and portion be, As long as life endures.  Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail, And mortal life shall cease; I shall possess, within the veil, A life of joy and peace.  The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, The sun forbear to shine; But God, who callÂd me here below, Will be forever mine.

      Why was I working so hard at something that should have some ups with downs. I focused on my patients and I started to lecture which allowed me to focus on the students. What was standing out was I giving them something more then I could measure. Again it was presenting something unmeasurable but I still had an imbalance in my life lead from home my home and wife and her family. I feel I was being told I can help people at all levels ,   BUT help your self first..     Still years rolled by and I was very succesfull in my business but shutting out the messages.   The greatest step I have ever taken was into the unknown and I am still travelling this journey.    Months ago I would have said the unfortunate thing was being thrown of the back of the ute under the rear wheel and injuring myself. Were I was hospitalised for a few months. I had fractured 14 bone 20 teeth and had a cereibal hemerage, which effected my sight, my ability to walk and talk and even remember anything.   But now looking back at it all yes I am sorry for the pain I had to take my family through and I wouldn't want this to happen again for there sake. In fact I wish this injury on my worst enemy.  It was the inner me saying time for you to listen now.  So the interesting thing for me is I didn't have any real guidance from my so called present thought or medical practitioners.   I was left to be directed by something?. A couple of the interesting succesful things for me came from yoga, meditation, the love of my family, sencere friends and a man called Mark who is my psycholist, they all headed in similiar directions, but had different names for things but the main thing was to listen to me.   I found my wife who I would've given everything too and done anything for, was very quick to leave me at the hospital to have brekkie with the man who had placed me there.  This man had lied the best he could to save him self. The other so called friends followed the same track lead by the driver who placed me on my death bed .   My wife tried to push my family away in fact the driver was told by a solicitor if he didnt call the police for 12 hours there is nothing the police can do. So my wife waited 10 hours to tell my family and when they got to the emergency they were told that every minute counts and I was doing well to be here at this point.   So here the lesson had decided to tell me the hard way. Not only was it making me rediscover myself by learning how to walk and talk re discover how to function brian wise.    Again another lesson telling me to enjoy each day and the simple things in my life.. I still had the choices to make and I tried to follow societies agreed direction. I found my self back home not sure were I was exactly. I was at my so called home were this person called my wife pushed me into two fits were I then started to be surdated.

        Was I still questioning or was I becoming one with my soul??     Although we have many religions in our world we seem to be uniformed in body and soul.  The interesting thing that was and is still prominent with the direction of western medicine is the one level approach to healing. Live or die approach! I was unable to estblish that. This thought was only one dimionsnal.  The live or die approach wasn't what attracted me to the craft of natural therapies.We are whole bodies existing with body and soul so when healing we should aproach our body and soul as one. We shouldnt segment ourselves.   All I was positive about was my strong need to help. This need was over ridened by alot of my desires and thought patterns sculptured by the surrounding society and life.  The outstanding imbalance was still there but I hadn't followed my energy directions. I was asking questions about my unhappiness when I got married.  Were would I go, the happiest day was tinted with doubt. Like many I stuck with it hoping time would change things for the better. People would say time will change things so I waited and things properably did change.Some of the signs that showed from my wife was her inability to understand change and to just love and be loved.   The big bomb was her brother being captured in Spain for trafficing illigal drugs. Earning money from peoples distruction disgusts me. Her family and herself were good at this and I should have let followed my inner self. To this day she still tries to take what really isnt hers. If your feel evil you should listen because it will eventually punish you.  I was losing this inner spirit, my spiritual strength and direction that others were able to focus on. I am going to say it here early, "I now know that it was an inner energy that I shared in my clinic" in the early early days not knowing this or allowing it to teach me allowed me to have material  success."something was missing". Dont get me wrong here I feel that material wealth and success can walk hand in hand with your spiritual direction. My clinic was very busy and the people came from all around to be treated by me.   Still I had a shallow view or should I say closed view on what I was able to pass to the next person through my touch ,presents and conversation.    Unaware of my actions the way that was simple was to shut out negativeness and forge forward in my chosen industry.  This wasn't working and the lesson signs were standing in front of me ( the more imbalanced I become, the less I could help people on all levels but I pushed them to the side to move on.) Whoooo is was starting a war with myself.

      For the first time I was letting myself be lead.  I started looking through papers that seemed like the thing one is suppose to do when  looking for something.   My innocents and lack of listening to the universe was apparent and I wasn't tuned I was doing what I had done in the past I was looking for a sign or something to stand out.   I had been directed, by my internal voice and not knowing this I began my search and there it was I am not sure what it was telling me, I had this positive comfort that this was the  job I was looking for. There was this deep emotional spirituality drawing me to this craft of helping people.  What I was learning to do was help people at levels I wasn't aware of.  The lesson was to listen and be directed, this lesson was to evolve with a new horizon.   We as humble people forget that we are body and soul influenced by positive and negative directions of energy. So I questioned normality before. Is it within us??     So the next question was :what was body and soul how do we function humbly beside it?     I looked for an answer in my religion I found a place where communication to your soul is humbly accessible and the church become a place of communication with me. Or Should I say through me without looking at it to religisously.

      As we are finding out around the world today that all societies are different yet   we are one in people  .  So again what is normality??  I deferred university to follow a hospitality industry career.  Five years of my life I spent trying to achieve the required goals set by management  and with all the effort I could muster I achieved goals and extended boundaries when I achieved these goals it was with sacrifice to me and benefits to others and ussually they set more goals.   What was the reward if any. Well I should have been able to see the lesson that was being presented.  I was learning, about others passions and indifference's.   What I was doing was starving my soul and my soul and direction. I was ingulfed in societies direction of material success to achieve something that didn't respect my humbleness and soul searching.   I found my self with a separat yarning a wanting to full fill something?? This separate heart beat that pounded inside me or energy within was telling me to move forward.   What and why I couldn't work out. yet there was an internal calling but it was becoming a scream. So I started to look and what I was looking for I didn't know I wanted that black board to show me.

        Were was I headed what was I looking for or maybe was I looking for something I already had?     Looking in to my existence? In the beginning I had a shallow view of the future and my existence. This view was influenced very much by commercial direction.  What I had to understand was my life was a journey, and a learning journey. What I was going to learn wasn't presented on any black boards or readable in any scriptures or manuscripts.   I had it in side me but to allow the lessons to emerge and humble me with there existence and directions is were the journey has it's storm's one thing that has certainly been shown to me is we have to listen or you will be made to listen!  Was I  strong enough to allow these lessons to be taught was I focused and wholly enough to see the lessons and step in the required direction.   Looking back it shows me many times when I feared to allow the messages to come through I feared being judged and I now realise the only judge was me.   I was a heavily one sided judge, I tried to maintain the so called  Normality  not looking into the general fear of the unknown.   What is normal and who can classify and describe normality and who decided on its boundaries??  An Easy answer used by all is society.  My question then is which society and which belief?

      I went and saw TROY on the weekend and what stood out the most to me is how much we haven't changed through the thousands of years. In the movie we saw negotiation before the war and then war were they successfully killed hundreds of people.   When what we had and are doing is still doing take the Iraq issue, we saw the same thing negation of war and then the killing which we are still having. What makes us different to animals?  In my opinion its thought not instinct, yet we don't seem to want to utilize thought. It shocks me that we have a democratic society trying to change a dictatorship.   We should remember that IRAQ has been ruled by a dictatorship for thousands of years and when change occurs this should be taken into account.   We have so much death and destruction without thought we are able as a untied force to change these things. I feel the problem is we cant or don't want to unite and we don't even look at our own back yards before cleaning other societies back yards.  don't get me wrong a threat is a threat and most time force should be met with force.
