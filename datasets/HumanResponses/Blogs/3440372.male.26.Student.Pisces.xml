      :: Puts on Generals Cap And Finds Pointer ::  As promised here are a few tips if you find yourself being forced to stay in hospital by 'the man': (I'm convinced that I am not sick, I think my doctors have Munchausens by proxy syndrome) here are a few do's and don'ts: when you hear these words, "you're doing well you should only need to be here for another week, purely for observation" your natural response may be "of course Doctor you're the professional I will do whatever you think is best"   THIS IS WRONG   this is a clever ruse they will use to try and get you to stay in hospital longer. They really don't like to see us leave. The correct response should be "am I going to die if I go home?"  If the answer to this is no, which it invariably is, leave. And I can't stress this enough. Leave as soon as you're able. Just run. If you can't run, get a wheelchair and healthy friend and make a break for it. It is a well-known fact that the chances of catching an infection are massively reduced once you the leave hospital.    I think I should take a minute here to explain that I have nothing against doctors or nurses, they do a wonderful job often for very little money and extremely long hours. I am Not entirely sure I could do their job. In fact, I'm sure I couldn't. Just wanted to clear that up.    If the running doesn't work or you can't find a healthy friend to help you (some friends can extremely squeamish about breaking a sick friend out of hospital, can't for the life of me work out why) then don't be afraid to cry, beg, cajole, threaten, bother, bribe, steal, harass, harangue, castigate, abuse, question a persons parentage, inquire whether the doctor has webbed feet, set fire to everybody's shoelaces, undo all the wheelnuts on everybody's wheelchairs, masturbate into the bed managers face cream (this may be difficult if you have a catheter), have sex with a melon in the middle of the ward, drink at all of the Lucozade on the ward and sing rule Britannia at the top of your voice until the sugar rush wears off, refuse to answer to anything other than Sir Snooty Monkey-Bottom the third (unless this is your real name, for which I am truly sorry, you will obviously need to think of another name) and if all else fails pretend to be dead. This way, when they take you to the morgue it will be a little easier to escape.  So there it is, 26 years of going to the hospital with alarming frequency has resulted in these 'ere pearls of wisdom. Use them wisely my friends. And remember, if you try any of these methods   You Will Look like a Twat  . But it is much easier and a little comfier to apologise when you are at home. And I always find focusing on leaving hospital with such intensity means the reason you are there becomes secondary and a little easier to deal with.  :: Nods Sagely and Ponders a Career in Motivational Speaking ::

      :: Wants to set fire to little puppies ::  I'm pissed off. It is silly o'clock in the morning and I'm up. That's right,I am posting here instead of lying in bed with my beautiful SO. My head hurts and snot is leaving my body at an alarming rate. This is total rubbish. I hate being ill. I'm used to dealing with massive life threatening illness, I've been doing that my whole life, it's the piss ant coughs and colds that really get me down. There is nothing to be done except feel like shit until it decides to go away. I know this might seem strange but when you are seriously ill (as I have been on occasions to numerous and dull to count) it is much easier for me to cope with. No, I'm not some psycho nut nut before you ask. But serious illness =   MORPHINE  . You go into hospital, they fill you full of that stuff, then at some point after that, you leave. Simple, effective and a bit scary. To be honest I could be in Fiji or orbiting Venus after a great big warm shot of that. So whats happening in the real world just kind of sits in the background of my mind till the thing that brought me there subsides,by which time I'm well enough to be thinking about exit strategies (more later about that).  so, in conclusion-colds bad, morphine good. Or something  :: thinks the puppies are probably safe now ::

      :: headfull of Snot ::  I have never once had hayfever, I think I have it now. It could just be a cold, but seeing as how I don't believe I am able to contract colds* then it can't be that. It has to be hayfever, it just has to be. I'm glad I've sorted that out. All logic and reason suggests it must be hayfever and not, as the evil ones will have you believe, a cold.  *it has long been my belief that if you don't believe in particular ailments, then it is not possible for you to contract them. It quite simple really. Don't believe, don't catch. Say with me people:   Don't Believe, Don't Catch!! Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!   Well now that I'm feeling safe and sound (and sane) I think I'm off to bed.  :: follows the little pixies to his bed in the cabbage patch ::

      :: woke up feeling too cool for school ::  drifts back to dreamland.......  so im sat in an office waiting for something, feeling pretty confident about things (not sure why, but I am)when in strolls JFK. it was at this point that I realized I was in the oval office. "Stuart" "yes Mr president" the room was an amalgamation of the west wing and the black and white footage of the Cuban missile crisis we have all seen a million times.(I was Sam from the west wing BTW)  "I have a very important assignment for you" "certainly sir" "I have to go and paint J.Edgar hovers left cheek orange, it's a whole big thing" "OOOO-kay" "I was supposed to be 'entertaining' about a dozen secretaries(mmmmmm secretaries) in an hour, I need you to fill in for me" suddenly im in a massive typing pool wearing just a cravat and smoking a bubble pipe  Well that's all folks, more  from my unbalanced subconscious later  :: wonders if i could get a secretary ::

      :: first-time for ages things on to-do list have been done ::  Feeling pretty good about things at the moment, have spent the day actually working. That' s right kids there has been very little watching of porn today it has mostly been about the work. I have been floundering the past couple of weeks worried about how to start this essay, my SO has just said  "get on with it, it will get easier" to which I scoffed, shouted and generally behaved like the spoilt seven-year-old I hope to turn into. (I think the work is of a relatively good standard as well)  Is it smugness or is it just a sense of a job well done.  The smugness could also be a little premature, once it has been marked I may find I have only scored 2%. Which would be annoying and probably well-deserved.  Anyway, I think I have a date with some Tibetan porn. (I bet you didn't know there was such a thing)  :: trousers round ankles, and a song in my heart ::

      :: confused much ::  i have just been reading in the paper about the fire in east london yesterday in which a hefty chunk of charles saatchi's art collection was turned to ashes. im not sure how i feel about this. on the one hand a piece of british cultural heritage has gone forever,while on the other, i thought it was all crap in the first place. hmmmm.  now i'm sure it's probably because i didn't understand the message, point or intention of the artist.and maybe its unfair to say it was all crap, better to say i didn't like it i think.  im sure that there was a point to all that but i cant remember what it was  :: wrinkles brow in frustration ::

That's what I'm supposed to be doing, but instead I am posting on here. I have also read lots of other web logs instead of working. It isn't as if I don't like the work but I just can't seem to get motivated. I'm convinced it's because my deadline isn't for another three weeks, in fact I'm sure that's what it is. Yes, I know how important it is but I would much rather nose about in the   BBC   web site.  I am sure I'll get it done, it's just that I thought I would have more enthusiasm for the work.  But my life is so difficult (oh be quiet twat boy)  :: hangs head in self-indulgent shame ::

      :: feeling calmer ::  I'm feeling much better now. Drank lots of coffee and talked things over with my SO. Hate feeling scared and miserable, you'd think I'd be used to it by now. I think once one stops being scared when your body breaks down then you're on the slippery slope to a lovely nervous breakdown.  I am also wondering whether I want people to comment on my Blog. I kind of want it to be private but at the same time, I want people to comment on it. (Oh the contradiction that is me!)  Right, I suppose I should go and do some work  :: still quite calm ::   urlLink  not sure why I find this site compelling

      Well then, wasn't that a crazy first post.I'm not entirely sure why I wrote any of that, then again I'm not entirely sure why I'm writing a Web log. It just seems like a really strange thing to do.  On a different note-I have just finished watching an episode halfway through season four of Angel (the turgid supernatural soap opera, for those who don't know) I have had many discussions with my SO about which is better, Buffy or Angel, with her in the Angel camp and with me firmly by Buffy's side. Angel is much better written but for sheer enjoyment it has to be Buffy every time.  The evil Anjelus has returned to wreak havoc on Los Angeles and be 10 times funnier than Angel. Whatever will happen next kids? Answers on a postcard, a prize for the best one.  I think this is an appropriate place to stop waffling and go to bed.

      While I think I may have just done something really stupid, I can't help but feel glad that no one will be able to read the last three weeks of insane ramblings. At the moment I'm sitting in my room absolutely smashed out of my tiny little mind on very strong painkillers. One thing they never tell you at the hospital is that everything feels like plasticine after a certain number of little pills. My face, his desk, this glass, who said Holmes, these headphones and oh yes this plasticine! Still not entirely sure why I would want in weblog of what I will put in it. But I think I'm going to be disciplined and write in it everyday. So here goes kids (who am I talking to exactly) let's see what forms out of my head over the next couple of weeks

      :: brief respite ::  I have just discovered much to my great amusement and relief that an assignment I thought I had to have done by the 12th of June really has to be in on the 12th of July. The worrying thing is when I got up this morning I felt extremely motivated and that I would work all day until a sizeable chunk of work had been completed, but as soon as I found out I had an extra month the motivation evaporated like cheap perfume.  So now, I find myself casting around for something to do (you do still have work to do twat boy), something that will occupy this lovely Wednesday afternoon. Blogger is an excellent place for this activity.    Sooooooo..............    If I ruled the world:  there would be no stilton  Post boxes would be blue  Cannabis would be compulsory  Everyone would have a 50Mbps Internet connection (for free)  Microsoft would be open source  I would have a doctor who had the time to spend more than five minutes with me (sob)  Mice would be as big as dogs  Dogs would be as big as mice  People wanting cosmetic surgery would have to see a therapist first  There would be no such thing as elective surgery  George Bush would be a small marmoset  I would swap Stephen Fry for Tony Blair and lock-up anybody who didn't agree  :: respite over ::

      :: behold, betrayer of one's roots ::  I wonder if I will be kicked out of the Guild, the Guild of lazy working class potheads™. I was first inducted to this rarefied institution couple of weeks after my 18th birthday. There was an initiation and everything. I was made to smoke two large bags of ganja and then perform a series of pointless tasks:  task one - to renounce all previous good deeds and promise never to do anything energetic again, on what would be pain of death if all the other members of the Guild weren't lazy potheads. So it will probably just be mild annoyance.  Task two - whilst being extremely smashed the initiate (me) had to order take away for six people from three different restaurants. This might sound like an easy one, but just try it. To get it wrong would mean that somebody's munchies were not satisfied. The guilt from this would be unbearable.  Task three - (by far the hardest) the 4 AM trip to the local 24-hour petrol station with eight people waiting back at the house for an assortment of chocolate, fizzy drinks and the charcoal briquettes (there's always one). Again this sound simple, and it would be if it weren't for the enormous pressure of forgetting a Milky Way on Mars bar.  After initiation I embarked on an illustrious career of doing very little, but doing it in a stylish and interesting way. There were parties, drugs, drink, other people (I think), the police, coastguard (there was a helicopter so must have been them), more parties, orbital, orbital, orbital, orbital, small amounts of crime, new trainers, havok, headaches, stomach aches, more headaches, bladder pain, sweating, more bladder pain, nosebleeds, blood coming from the corner of my eye, realisation that most of the people I knew were absolutely undeniably crazy, more serious bladder pain, hospital's, hospitals and more Fucking hospital's, dark prognosis from doctors, ignorance of all doctors advice, doctors saying "no seriously, you have to chill out", more ignoring of doctors, lots and lots inadvisable drink and drugs, this bladder pain is quite serious now, hospitals, headaches, hospitals, massive amounts of pain and then as if from nowhere a startling realisation took hold:    maybe if I chill out a little bit, my life may start to sort itself out    No shit Sherlock!! So I stopped, made a reasonably clean break from all the stuff that was stressing me out and put my life on track. Not sure if there should be a sense of achievement just because you stopped being a total Twat, but I felt it.  Anyway, had a point, I am sure I did. Oh yes for the past three hours I have worked solidly and unflinchingly at one subject and made some quite reasonable progress. I think I'm developing a work ethic. But it is just come to my attention, that I'm not actually working instead I'm posting on here. Idiot. I had no need to worry. Thought I had my life on track and was working studiously towards my degree. But it turns out that I'm still frighteningly able to avoid work for ages without even noticing.

The Internet is such a wonderful place, it offers numerous distractions from the myriad things I really should be doing.

We went to possibly the nicest Chinese restaurant in Manchester, the food was excellent and service was great, all in all a good time was had by everyone.    when I arrived home I was supposed to be going out with some friends, but they had all made alternative arrangements. This has annoyed me immensely. "Calm down" I hear you say, "you'll see them tomorrow or another day". And I totally agree with you, I really shouldn't be upset. But that's the thing about being housebound, very occasionally I really really want to go out with my friends and also feel physically able, which is quite rare.....
