      Hey hey, it's been a while, I've been FreeBSDifying Chris's computer after realizing that Nortonifying it with w2k made it unusably slow. So F it, screw windows, there's nothing it can do that freebsd can't do better.. Wait, let's just shorten that down to "There's nothing it can do."  So, what have I been up to besides computer stuff... Well, I took a stroll down Hennessy Road, walked into 298, and didn't ever want to leave. This is the biggest computer mall i've ever seen. It's an entire mall, just selling computer stuff. 3 floors! It's insane! And the deals! Oh my god the DEALS! It's got to be stolen. It's just gotta. Stuff that would sell for $150 maybe $200 in Canada, is like $8 here.   They've got alot of stuff like that here, I was shopping for shoes with Chris in Mong Kok, we turn a corner and walk into a shoe store, nothing exciting so we leave... I spot another shoe store across the street. I must have looked foolish when I mentioned "Hey, there's another shoe store across the street." To which Chris just said, "Yeah, but there's another one right here."  "Waaaaiiiit a minute.... *eyes shifting suspiciously* ALL the stores on this street are shoe stores!" "Yes, this street is called Shoe Street"  I thought that was a neat little odditty.. But then, the next time I went to Mong Kok, I walked down "Fish Street" which consists of all pet stores, mostly tropical fish stores, and then down "Flower Street" which was an entire street of just flower shops, and finally down Wedding Dress Street..  There's also a brothel street...  But I saw a FISH WITH HANDS!!! IT HAD HANDS!!!! NOT FINS!!! HANDS!!! And the fish itself looked like a rock, but WITH HANDS!! I'll try to find a picture online of this fish, it was amazing.  Mong Kok, I'm told, means "Place where there are too many people", and that is an understatement. It's crazy. And I haven't been there on a weekend yet. But, it's the best place to shop i think, everything's pretty cheap, especially if you're looking for knock-offs.  However, if you're looking for knock-off watches, just walk down any road in Tsim Sha Tsui for about, say, 3 meters, and (especially if you're white) you'll have 3 Indian guys in your face screaming "Fake Rolex? Gucci? Tag? Gucci? Gucci?" But once you escape them, there'll be another 3 that are trying to make custom suits for you. I understand that they offer cheap suits, I understand that $70 is a good price for a suit, I understand that, I get it, Yes yes, but I don't want a suit right now, no, no I don't want to go see your pushy tailor who will demand that he take measurements right away, no, i'm going to the museum, i don't want a suit, no, come-on dude i'm not insterested, no, no, no, FUCK OFF!!  Oh yes, and I'm quite upset about the lack of Tazo Chais at Starbucks.     San Migeul time!

      Ok, anyone can post comments now... But let's keep them somewhat un-incriminating, my parents read this.

      Nothing better than beer and dim sum at half past midnite.  I just got in, I've been wandering again. I took a stroll through the university campus, the City University of HK... Nice.. I thought Mount A was hilly, well City U has nothing but hills, but the hills are so steep there's stairs everywhere. There's actually a hiking trail through the campus. It's wierd, you can stop along your hike for a break, duck into a tunnel, and you're in the mall. Then you can grab a Shogun Burger at McDicks, or maybe some Salmon McPoppits, fried McShrimplings (if you eat that crap), and a Corn Pie for desert. But the one thing they unfortunately kept was that damn "I'm Lovin' It" slogan.  But that's if you're a filthy gwai-lo (ghost, derogatory term for a white foreigner) who can't resist McDonalds when there's much better food at the food court.   Let's see, the food court consists of: A sushi bar, a noodle bar, a barbeque w/rice bar, a noodle bar, and a noodle-soup bar. The KFC is on the other side of the skating rink.  But if you're  really  cool, like me, you go down 5 floors to the coffee shop and play Playstation2 for a few hours against some 10 year old chinese kid who kicks your ass in every game you play... EXCEPT Puzzle Bobble (Bust-A-Move), in which I skunked him eleven-nuthin! Doo doo doop! Doo doo doop! Doo doo doop dee doo dee WHOOPIE!!

      ... so i took it off and I shook it, well lookit lookit lookit! You know what fell out? (What fell out?)  A newt!  We have to leave our shoes out in the hall here, but the hallway is not really outside, but the front door is more like a gate.. So I'm going out to buy some fishcake and pocky, i put one shoe on, fine, i reach my foot over to the other shoe, tap it a bit to starighten it for optimal foot penetration, and a freakin lizard scurries out! I shrieked like a girl.. Like Ned Flanders..  So besides that, you may be wondering why I haven't posted in a while. Well, I had just cleaned Chris's computer up, erased everything, reinstalled windows, found 14 viruses and 400 adawre objects (i don't understand why either), erased everything again, reinstalled, and made it all fresh and tasty... Well she got another virus and i spent all day cleaning it again.. AVG didn't find the virus (yeah, i know, AVG sucks monkey balls), McAffee didn't find it, finally Norton found it.. Anyways, I'll save to gory details for people who care (Rob, that means you). So we're back online now, torrents galore...  Chris's mum (Auntie) taught me how to cook a fish today, i was pleased, i had questions, she couldn't answer them of course, since my cantonese is less than terrible, but my chinese writing ain't so bad, so i got the jist of it. I'm pretty pleased about this since I'll have to cook in a few months when I move into The Sweet Jesus... I need a wok.. So Mom, if you're listening, I'd like a wok with a lid for my birthday, along with other cooking things, maybe we can go shopping in chinatown when i'm back for a few days. I'll need a Pocky fix anyways...  The food here is most definitely not what you get in Ottawa at chinese restraunts, and completely not what you get at "The Hong Kong Kitchen" in Sackville. I got a fish soup the other day at a Shanghainese restraunt, very spicy with big chunks of fish in it, it was awesome..  I watched "Blow" the other day, it kinda blew (ha). It was great for the first half, then it got all sad and the guys life turns to shit.. Sorry to ruin the ending, but if you want to enjoy the movie, stop watching it at the point where he has a baby.  Alright, 4:14am, time for sleep.

      I need a coaster, but not for my drink. For me. I am sweating so much, there is actually a real live puddle below me. I'm going to ruin the floor i think...  I went out for dinner with my future in-laws, it was interesting. See, they don't speak any english, and I don't speak Cantonese yet. Auntie was wearing an Ayumi Hamasaki shirt, I wonder if she knows who it is? I wonder if she even likes her? I know she doesn't speak any japanese... it would make things a little easier for me if she did. I'm finding it a little hard to get used to the eating ritual of grabbing the food you want from a center plate - WITH YOUR DIRTY CHOPSTICKS. They seem to be clean freaks except for that, they wash all the dishes with the tea before they eat off them. Yes, at the table in the restraunt, they clean the dishes. I know I've lost weight, I fit my pants now that were too small for me.. It's got to be all the fish and pocky. Yes. When I return to canada I start a strict diet of fish and Pocky. That is all for today, I'm being hailed on MSN..

      They have channel 1 here! CHANNEL ONE! That's so cool.  They've also got really cool water boilers, it's not really a kettle, more like a thermos water dispenser that keeps water hot and ready all day, and you push the pumping button to make it come out... Sounds pretty boring, but man it's awesome. Especially when you want some tea, and you want it RIGHT NOW. Hmmm.. this post is going nowhere, and i find it highly uninteresting, so I must put a stop to it.

      I'm not sure why, maybe the soy sauce is getting to me, but I'm making a blog. Maybe I'm a little bored. I'm feeling a bit like the girl in Lost in Translation, I'm now living in Hong Kong with my fiance, but she works all day, and I stay in her room studying... But that doesn't last so long, I've been doing a lot of wandering around, eating pocky and some strange, quite unlike cake, "fishcake" substance that, though i've never liked fish, tastes delicious. Actually, I now eat fish, or should i say fishes, like, the whole fish goes on my plate, and i scarf it down. The eyes taste wierd. It's a cool 32 degrees in the shade, so I drink alot of bottled sweat "Pocari Sweat", it tastes like gatorade, but with no flavour. Oh, dinner time! gotta go!   Enjoy, SofaKiD

      *Blows away the dust* Hmm, I guess it's been a while since I've updated this... Sorry.. Well, at least I update more frequently than  urlLink Strong Bad's Emails ... The new one of which is pretty lame i think... It doesn't get any better than saying email 100 times...  So, let's see, Chris's sister and brother are in town, her sister's boyfriend is here too, it's been pretty cool, we've been pretty busy.. Lotsa fun.. The first night we went to Karaoke, which is actually pretty fun. It's nothing like in Canada, where if you want to sing, you sing in front of a pile of strangers who boo you even if you're really good... Here, you get a private room, and the drinks are cheap, and you just sit around a table with just your friends... You don't even have to sing, but after a few buckets of beer are delivered, everyone is fighting of the microphone... I sang chiquatita by abba... yes.. yes that's right.. Well, I'm told that I sang it.. memory's a little hazy :S  We went to Macau yesterday, that was pretty cool, it's like the other Hong Kong. Except, you feel like you are in Europe, it's all portugese.. but still chinese.. hard to explain, but really cool.. They even have tons of mopeds and teeny tiny winding uphill alleyways.   I haven't got any time to get those photos online yet, but I'll get on it soon.. This blogging site doesn't exactly have photo publishing, you have to set up a separate service, but i'm told it integrates well with them.. but then again, i'm quite lazy, and have little tolerance for slow computers, or even effort in general..   I watched Twins Effect again last night, I'm becoming more and more under the impression that this is the single greatest movie ever made. It's rediculus, but what do you expect from a chinese kung fu vampire romantic comedy? Especially one starring Ekin and the Twins?? The teddy bear fight  urlLink scene  is still my favorite.  Oh yes, for those of you who i haven't force fed the movie to multiple times, it's called "Vampire Effect" in north america, and it's at rogers.. (the one in the centrum)  Go rent it now! NOW! (and don't watch the dubbed version, the dubbing is AWFUL)  I "read" something interesting in a magazine here... It was a chinese magazine, so it was more like looking at the pictures of all the ladies... Anyhoo, I saw an ad for Twins Effect 2! This should be interesting, Gillian had really weird hair though, like ancient chinese men's hair...  Speaking of movies, a great one a saw the other day is "Ong-Bak" the torrent file is on suprnova if you want to check it out, it's a thai kickboxer movie, complete with "Let's See That AGAIN! AND AGAIN! AND AGAIN! AND AGAIN!" type stunts, but it's amusing, I love how at the beginning he makes a promise to never ever use his supreme ass-whooping powers, you just know that's the time when you set your watch for 2 minutes from now... when the supreme ass-whooping frenzy begins.  The scens are pretty predictable, like, the hero gets chased down an alley-way, which is full of hawkers selling various fruits and precious fragile antiques, which are promptly squashed and smashed.. Also, guys seem to always carry some strange obstacle into the center of the path just as our hero is approaching. We then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, we then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, we then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, we then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, It's awesome!      It's cool to watch their legs, they bend in ways you wouldn't expect possible, somehow they can make their knees swing up and come out of their foreheads.. It's like they're aliens..  Considering how awesome it is, this post can only go downhill from here, so i'll end it.

      I've travelled half away around the world to escape these monsters. I'm wearing headphones, blasting music, but all I can hear is middle-aged white women laughing.  What the hell? I thought they were all safely tucked on the 60/62/65 express buses?  Hey, could you keep it down a scoche? Some of us are trying to study!  I guess that's what I get in the cafes. So if I can't study, I'll blog.  Last night was interesting, I fell asleep listening to a cantonese-learning CD. You know how when you listen to mono in headphones, it sounds like it's coming from inside your head? It can induce some strange dreams. For some reason the english would command me what to dream about, and then the people would speak cantonese.  It was really creepy. I remember I got really pissed off because I was slowly realizing that everyone I knew could speak perfect cantonese... Amy and Joe (my sister and her husb.) were the first, then Lily and Stella (my young and extremely young nieces). Then everyone else, it was pretty discouraging..  I spoke to auntie (I don't think I'll ever get used to that word "auntie") at dinner last night, she understood the first thing I said, but then i think i must've gotten nervous and messed up the rest, 'cause then she looked pretty confused..  So all I managed to say was "I was up until 5am last night". I think later when I was saying "I want to speak cantonese", i was saying "I want to smoke cantonese"... Probably not the right thing to say to my future inlaw. Damn tones. When you're nervous, it's difficult to  sing  what you want to say.  Um.. the bothersome old ladies are gone now.. study time..
