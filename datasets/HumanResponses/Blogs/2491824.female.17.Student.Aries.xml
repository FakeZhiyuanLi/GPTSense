       Listening to - MTV... blah, I want to kill myself....or everyone at MTV...  On my mind - I should be paaartayin at Molly's but I sleep too damn much  I just burned water...  Burned water ...  ...And to think, people once said that I was a good cook.  UPDATE- Not only did I manage to burn water, I broke the pan which I burned the water in... The bottom layer of the pan peeled off about half an inch on one side, and I easy pulled off the rest of it. Craziness...

       Listening to -  Gladiatior   On my mind - I want a life...  I found this on  urlLink TEOTI  and thought it was cute...  "Ten Rules For Being Human" by Cherie Carter-Scott     You will receive a body. You may like it or hate it, but it's yours to keep for the entire period.    You will learn lessons. You are enrolled in a full-time informal school called, "life."    There are no mistakes, only lessons. Growth is a process of trial, error, and experimentation. The "failed" experiments are as much a part of the process as the experiments that ultimately "work."    Lessons are repeated until they are learned. A lesson will be presented to you in various forms until you have learned it. When you have learned it, you can go on to the next lesson.    Learning lessons does not end. There's no part of life that doesn't contain its lessons. If you're alive, that means there are still lessons to be learned.    "There" is no better a place than "here." When your "there" has become a "here", you will simply obtain another "there" that will again look better than "here."    Other people are merely mirrors of you. You cannot love or hate something about another person unless it reflects to you something you love or hate about yourself.    What you make of your life is up to you. You have all the tools and resources you need. What you do with them is up to you. The choice is yours.    Your answers lie within you. The answers to life's questions lie within you. All you need to do is look, listen, and trust.    You will forget all this.    (Note: I love blogger... It reminded me that I didn't close a tag... Isn't that so thoughtful of it?!)

       Listening to - Shindig, "This Is a Crime Scene" ( urlLink www.trendymusic.com )  On my mind - I neeeeed a good book!  When I exhale through my nose, it sounds like a train whistle...  ...If it was colder outside I could run around with my head back and exhale through my mouth to create a smokestack effect... while simultaneously exhaling through my nose for the cool whistle sound....

       Listening to -Punchline- "Stop"  On my mind - I need to stop procrasting...  Today in Theatre3, we watched the Wizard of Oz along the Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon". And it was really neato because the music corresponds  perfectly  to the events in the movie... Oh, man. It was mega-awesome... I actually I think I like it better with just the music.  ..I mean, Pink Floyd... Who couldn't love it?  Whhhheeee!  ...Man I love saying that..  Aight, I gotta get to work on the sound effects for  Wings ...

I'm considering putting a picture of a slope and a lift at  urlLink Whitetail  for the time being, but it's been a while since I have done anything with pictures and HTML...

       Listening to - something on TV, but it is basically background noise that i am ignoring...  On my mind - wow... ...i'm so lucky...   I love the simple things in life.  ....At night, when I think back on what happened that day, I don't remember the supposedly "big" things, (i.e.- what I scored on a major test, what kind of trouble I got into (with parents, family, school, etc.) or any of that crap). What I think about and what I focus on are the little things. Such as: some random person saying hi and smiling at me, some minor complement from someone that i did not know (or not very well), helping someone (yay! i love doing that!), or just hearing a damn good song... .......I heard such an awesome song today... It's "The Future Freaks Me Out", and it's by the Motion City soundtrack. I had it stuck in my head all day... It's good stuff...  Here are my favorite lyrics from the song, tehe...   I'm on fire and now I think I'm ready to bust a move Check it out I'm rocking steady To the beat in my head It goes 'oh, oh, oh, oh'   Hehe. That is so me... I'm always just off in my own little world dancing away to some song I made up in my head....   Good stuff...  ...I love the little things...

       Listening to - Micheal Moore's speech  On my mind - Isn't this country (and its people) wonderful?!  /sarcasm  I just finished watching  Bowling for Columbine . Wow. Great movie. It's really an eye opener. If you haven't seen it, go rent it as soon as possible.  It's amazing. Watch the DVD extras also. Right now I'm watching Micheal Moore's speech speech at the University of Denver six months after the movie was released. Good stuff.  Really, you have to see this movie..

       Listening to -  Cast Away   On my mind - nothing muuuch...  David has tuberculosis.  ...Actually, he's had it for at least a week or two now. He  had to get a vaccination for it because he's working in foodservice at the race track, and he ending up getting it. Doesn't that suck?  .....He's still going to school and work and everything though, so he's saying that we (all his friends) should get tested for it also.  ...Anyway, don't eat at the track.  David works there and has TB... ...Then you'll get it and die... Well, probably not die since we can treat it and all that stuff, but it could happen...

I love it.  I love being happy...

       Listening to - nothing... well, ignoring whatever is on TV  On my mind - I'm content, and I love the feeling. :)  I love dreaming. There is just something about it--the way it makes me feel-- that I just can't describe.  No matter what the dream is about-- no matter if it is terrifing or blissful-- my dreams just make me feel so... good.  I don't know if there is a word for the feeling. I wish there was so I could explain.   I want to go to sleep now so I can dream...  (P.S.-- I'm looking at new templates for this, and might even try to make my own because I've found some awesome drawings-- urlLink this one  and  urlLink this one  and  urlLink this one -- that I just adore at  urlLink explodingdog . Yay!)

       Listening to - Steven Lynch.. on TV   On my mind - I come up with the best ideas in my dreams.. then remember only fragments of them when I wake up... :/  School is cancelled for tomorrow, and I've heard that we supposed to keep getting snow until Wednesday. Awesome stuff...  I was supposed to have my lines memorized for the student-directed, one-act that I am in,  Actor's Nightmare , by Monday--well, if we were having school. So, I really need to get working on that.. I know them somewhat, but.. not good enough...  I had a dream today--I slept all day-- that it was the final performance, and I didn't know my lines... That was some scary stuff....

This brought on another bout of sickness, which surgeons countered by drilling holes in your skull. The following months saw you suffer an exorcism, beg your friends to kill you, go into hyperactive fits of gaiety, run through your rooms to the point of exhaustion, hide from imaginary assassins, claim your name was Georges, deny that you were King and fail to recognise your family. You smashed furniture and wet yourself at regular intervals. Passing briefly into erratic genius, you believed yourself to be made of glass and demanded iron rods in your attire to prevent you breaking.   ...What a crazy man....

       Listening to - nothing...  On my mind - I don't feel so hot...  Random thought!:  I want to open an independent music store around here...  ...Well, obviously not soon, but when I get in my mid-20s ...Oh yeah.    ...Why do I want to do this?... Because the only places to buy CDs around here are FYE and Wal-Mart!  ...Blargh...  ....I think the nearest one is around D.C... and I don't want to drive 75 minutes just to buy CDs...  ...Well, yeah I probably would... If I had my license, I'm sure I'd be driving there on a regular basis...

       Listening to - ....something on tv....  On my mind - ...I can't take it...  As much as I hate to admit it, I think I need to go back on anti-depressants. They took away my personality and randomness... But they made me feel secure. I knew I wasn't but they allowed me to at least feel like it. I know I have a damn easy life compared to many people, but I can't take it.   I've come to the point where any little stress makes me freak out. ...For example, I started crying this evening after realized that the lady who made my sub at Nick's (they have the  best  subs) put mayonnaise on what could have been an amazingly awesome turkey sub. ...I  cried  over mayonnaise on a sub.  Everything makes me want to cry... I was just reading an email... It was an ad for some snowboarding website, but I didn't understand exactly what it was trying to get at... So I nearly cried...  ...I didn't cry at my grandmother's funeral last week, but I almost cried over an advertisment in an email...  I'm pathetic....  Anyway... Tonight after rehearsal (for the student directed one-acts-- I got a fairly decent part. Yay!), I had planned on getting a delicious sub at Nick's and eat it while watching  Young Frankenstein  (Dillon let me borrow the DVD today). I was so excited. The day had been going great. I aced my monologue for my Theatre3 exam, and rehearsal went dandy. Everything was just hunky-dory! Mom took me to Nick's I got a sub and couldn't wait to get home. Once I was home, I sat down with sub took a few bites, then realized there was mayo on it. ...Why can't people just learn how to make a sandwich without putting mayonnaise on it?! ...It's not that hard!  ...Even  I  can do it! RAAAGGHHH!... So...I could deal with that... I had some tortilini left over from dinner last night that I could eat. So.. I went to get the DVD player to move it from the living room into the family room, where I am whenever I am not at school... The case for  The Pianist  was laying in front of the DVD player, so I, of course I figure it was in there... I opened the DVD player and didn't see it. Pissed, I continued to unhook the cables to move it into another room. ...Later, I was asking mom where the  The Pianist  DVD was, and I opened the DVD player again to show her it wasn't in there. Not there!.... I closed it and heard what sounded like the tray that the DVD goes on hitting something as it closed...like a DVD!... Bah... Anyway... the disc is somehow now stuck in the DVD player, so they are both probably broken now... So that screwed up my other plan for the evening... Then, like icing on the cake, Bill, my mom's boyfriend and the biggest asshole in the world comes in. I am of course still having a fit over the sub, the DVD player, and all the other shit that has gone wrong, and how worthless I am in general. And he is making fucking smart-ass comments after every thing I say, which, pisses me off even more. I stand up, yell at him to shut the fuck up (to which he makes even more fucking smart-ass comments). At this point, I can't take it any longer, so I do the only thing that ever comes remotely close to making me feel better... I pick something up, throw it around hoping that I will break something. ..I didn't break anything :\  ...I just caused Bill to yell at mom because she "needs to stop giving in to me" or some bullshit like that... (did she do anything to "give into me" tonight? no! ...well, except maybe by buying me food and by not yelling at me like everyone else when I start crying.... fucking bastard... where the hell did that get that fucking idea of "giving in"?... he needs to get his fucking head out of his ass once in awhile!)... It's hard to understand someone when his speech is almost unintelligible because of the disgustingly thick hick accent and every other word is "fuck" or "fucking" or "motherfucking" or "motherfucker"... And I'm always the one who gets yelling at for cussing...  ...So many fucking double-standards...  .....How I would love to have killed him right then and there......  ...I guarantee that if I live to be 30, I'll be in jail... probably for murder or attempted murder... so maybe people piss me off and just keep pushing me and pushing me and fucking pushing me..... I fucking try to warn them to stop, but no one fucking understands... The only way I can really express my anger is phyiscally, and I only can hold it in so long....  ...God I sound like a fucking psychopath... .....At that point, I was thinking of every possible way to seriously injure/kill myself... They only good ideas I came up with were jumping through the huge window in the family room where I was (it was on the first floor, so there wouldn't be a fall, kbut I'm sure the glass would put a hell of a hurting on me) or crashing a car going really fast into a bunch of trees... The only problem with that was I didn't have a car. But, if I did, I don't honestly know if I'd be typing this now, or if I would now or one with a tree....  ...I'm sorry to everyone I know that is reading this.... I'm sorry you had to read this... Well, you didn't " have to " read this, you did it completely under your own free-will... But still, I'm sorry....  Lately nothing has seemed fun or interesting...  I went snowboarding on Friday, and anyone who knows me knows that I love snowboarding... Did I have fun? ...No, it was boring... :\ I hated it... For most of the evening, Luke and I hung out in the lodge and the store where Joanna was working...  Not even music is appealing to me... It feels pointless to me... ...bah, I don't know how I feel... The only thing that has interested me lately is reading... I guess because it allows me to escape this place and become enthralled in another world. In books, there isn't anyone telling me that I am "wasting my potential", that I am a slacker (although that is completely true), there is no one nagging me about my grades (hey, I'm making better grades than my brothers ever did...), or doing any other fucking thing to piss me off... And, what is so great about books is that, if something does piss me off in them, I can stop reading them... And, voila!, nothing pissing me off!...   I have such a strong urge to go back to using drugs, they were such a relief... such an escape... For just a couple hours I could forget about all the problems and all the bullshit... God, that was so nice.... ...I'm not talking drugs like pot, because smoking is disgusting... I've been "craving" morphine lately... I don't whether it is because of the fact that I used to be addicted to it's little brother, codiene, or because I know I could easily overdose.... either way... :shrug:   ...I'm sorry that this post is so long...

       Listening to - SNL  On my mind - brrrrrrr!  I need knee socks... My lower legs are always soo cold!  Also, I think I am going to start a charity. It'll be called "The National Fund to Get Ashley a Snowboard"... :)   You should donate a bunch of money to it... It's a worthy cause, honest...  The reason I really want one now, as opposed to waiting until spring/summer when they will be cheaper, is that I'm sick of the rental boards and boots. The board suck because they've been abused so much. The boots are, of course, torn up and worn out, and they are too wide. My feet slip out (while going down the slopes!) no matter how tight they are tied... ....Plus when I tell the guys at the rental place what size board I want they ask me over and over if I'm sure I want that size ... Because it is a pretty big size (152, size being the length in centimeters) for someone of my height--it's eight inches taller than me...  ..Plus they don't even have 152s... So after a minute of so of them making sure that I really want a 152, they tell me I have to settle for either a 150 or a 154...   Bah...   I'm cold...

       Listening to - nothing...  I want to update, but I have so many (boring and pointless) things to talk about so I won't... ....Well, maybe a little...  I auditioned for the student directed plays today. I thought that I royally sucked... I was stumbling over my words, mis-reading the lines, and just getting all flustered. ...But one of the directors told me at today's  Wings  rehearsal that I did good... So, I dunno... I'm sure I will get a part... But I'll know for sure on Monday...  Oh, oh! ...At lunch Eddy and one of the British chicks--there are two unrelated girls that I know of from Britian that go to Jefferson-- were going around with a pink lemonade flavored lollypop and having a bunch of people lick it...  I was number 23. :)

      You are Cleopatra of the Nile.  The great biographer of the time, Plutarch, wrote of Cleopatra, 'Her actual beauty, it is said, was not in itself so remarkable that none could be compared with her, or that no one could see her without being struck by it, but the contact of her presence, if you lived with her, was irresistible . . . It was a pleasure merely to hear the sound of her voice, with which, like an instrument of many strings, she could pass from one language to another . . .'  You have a spark in you that draws other people to you. Indeed, you are drawn to others because you are always curious.

       Listening to - Flinch, "Song About A Song About A Girl"  Being bored makes me sad. Seriously, when I'm not doing 5 things at once, I get sad...  Last night Mom and I picked up some subs from King's, and the guy working the cash register was a freak of nature. Well, not really, but he boggled my mind. He looked Hispanic (no big deal there, since 75% of the people who work in restuarants around here are Hispanic), but he had a really strong Italian accent (which by itself would not be a big deal, because the owners are Italian, and often they are curse very loud in Italian).. ...But he didn't look a bit Italian!   ...Yeah, I know, it's no big deal... I'm just really bored right now..  And I feel sick.  I took some Dimetapp for my cold a couple hours ago, and since then, I have been feeling like I am going to vomit and am now feeling weak and shaky...   ....Like I said I'm bored..   Not even music is entertaining me. ...But  Adult Swim  is coming on in 30 minutes...  Yay!...

We made a decent amount of money though. Craig said we made about $200(?) at the door. Not too bad, I suppose...   Teoti  is down.  I'm bored.

       Listening to - Family Guy  Blah... I didn't go to school yesterday because mom and I got into a fight, as usual, and she left without me. Blah. So that meant that I had to miss rehearsal for  Wings , our competition play.  I'm kind of glad I wasn't there though. G, our theatre teacher/director, kicked about a third of the people out of the play because they were goofing off and missing cues... G was really, really, super-ultra pissed and he said that he had "never been more disappointed in a group of students before".   The people that he kicked out were most of the best actors and actresses at our school and he recast their parts to sucky sophomores with little or no acting experience, making them far less than qualified to be in the competition play.... Needless to say, anyone who gave a damn about theatre at Jefferson was pissed at G.. All day people were talking to him about, whether calmly or in anger.. In 7th period (Theatre3), a class which many people in  Wings  have, G pulled us all to the back of the auditorium and had a good, long talk to us about what happened yesterday and how he felt and what options he had... After quite a bit of lecturing, G said he would go back to the original cast, and then began asking the people that he kicked out if they were willing to come back. Everyone said they would come back, except Bryan who changed his mind after Tab, who was also kicked out of the play, talked. She told everyone to swallow their pride and come back. She was crying and what she said was really good... Way to go Tab...  .....G also said that it was "scary" how much talent was in our school. Wheee... We gots talent!    ...There was more to my bad day than that, but that was what got it going in such a bad direction... Oh, and I got a new keyboard and mouse! Yay! ... I love 'em!  On Monday and Tuesday, I'm going to be in Charleston to be a page at the State Legislature. I'm so excited!    ..I'm also getting out of rehearsal those two days. G didn't seem too care much, as long as I was sure the other sound tech (who isn't too wise in the ways of the sound board) was able to run sound those days... She says that she can... I think I'm going to have her run sound tomorrow to make sure she actually can do it.  I wore flip-flops again today.  ...It's official, I love flip-flops.   Oh, and even as much as I hate people, I do adore some of them. People can be so sweet. It's crazy the compliments I've been getting from everyone lately...   I think I had more to say, but oh well... I forget, I guess....  Oh!... For my research paper, I think I am going to on the legalization of drugs. It'll be fun.

       Listening to - Sugarcult, "Pretty Girl" ...*sigh* I love Sugarcult...  On my mind - ...No fooking way!?...  ...WE WON! ...We got the award for best play/one-act/whatever... ....Wheeeeeeee! *dances a happy dance* The show went smashingly! We actors performed flawlessly, of course! All of the technical aspects were wonderful. Yay!    .....It snowed this morning.. :) I didn't realize that it was snowing until after I had walked outside. ..And I wore flip-flops again today. :D It felt so good to be standing out in the snow, catching snowflakes on my tongue, and feeling snow fall on my toes and melt... Mmmm, good stuff... I love snow...  Bah, that reminds me... I haven't been snowboarding in over a month and a half... That really bums me out..  I don't have time for it..  Bah...  Hahah.. Jordan--who is in the same play as me and won "Best Male Actor"!-- reminds me of Stewie from Family Guy. He always uses ridiculously big/obscure words and frequently insults people using those ridiculously big/obscure words. I noticed this tonight...Hahahaha... Man, It was good stuff...   ...I have a reseach paper to do for English... I'm actually not too concerned about because the topic is...anything! (As long as it is a contempory issue...) It has nothing to do with English! :) ...except that is has to be written in English... .....Actuuuallly, he didn't specify what language it was to be written in... Mwhahahaha... Too bad I don't speak any other language well enough to write a research paper in it... Last year I wrote a paper in Spanish.. but that was only a little over a page long...  ...Hmm... Oh! Jordan seems to speak Spanish pretty darn good, and Jona does also!... And, oh, oh.. There's the foreign exchange student from Argentina! ....But her English doesn't seem to be too stellar, so I'd be concerned about how well she could translate it.... ....Hah, not like I could actually do that and still get a grade on it...  *snap*   I wrote down some ideas for my topic, and I can't decide which to use... Here they are... 1- Legality of gay marriage, (for) 2-What marriage mean in Hollywood/The value of marriage in Hollywood 3-Legalization of drugs, (for) 4-The effects of censorship on young minds and consquences later in life... (This one seems to have a sciency edge to it, so I don't know whether it'll be acceptable..) 5-Civil rights violations in America today 6-something about a Constitutional admendment to allow foreign born citizens to become President.. ( idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger ) or 7- something else having to do with the Constitution...  ...I was bored when Russel (my English teacher) was going over the requirements and what not, so I turned him out for the most part and just thought of ideas...  Wheeeee...    (Sorry this was so long.)

       Listening to - tv....  On my mind - sleeeeeeep...  I didn't go to sleep last night, if you didn't guess that already.. So this morning, I decided to wear flip-flops because they always put me in a good mood. For some reason, whenever I wear them I feel better about myself.  So the day started out wonderfully.  Then, because I have nothing to think about during the school hours, I began to think about how I hardly ever talk to any of my friends anymore. The only time we actually talk is during lunch. It's really depressing. :\  ..Bah.  Today, at the graded  performance, all went well except that CJ, the dumb-ass running the lights, kept fooking up his cues... Bah.  But, as for us actors, we all did great.  I can't wait for the show tomorrow.  ..Bah, But I did have to wear make-up, as all actors do. (I  never  wear make-up..) People said it looked really good on me and "brought out my pupils". (Thanks, Aaron!) I think it made me look like a cheap whore though... ..Maybe someday I'll give into the evils of make-up... maybe..   I got home checked an email, and found out that I am now a Goddess on  TEOTI . Wheeeeee!  I've known since the 10th that I was going to become one, but I actaully am one now! Yay!  (Mad props for REALITY...)  I think there was more that I wanted to say... but I forgot... :   Conversation snippet of the day:  Jordan- "I'm going to throttle your brains out!" me- "Wow, that sounds dirty..."

       Listening to - Space Ghost  On my mind - HTML is not my friend today...  I hate school. I hate homework. I hate sentences. That contain more than three words. Fragments are ok. Even with more than three words.  I'm stupid.  We have show tomorrow. Well, it's not really a show. But it's the real deal. The directors are going to be graded.  I'm nervous.  Jordan and I made each other laugh--I don't think it was  too  noticable though--while we were on stage at our last run-through. He wouldn't give me his pants.  I think you'd have to see the show to understand.  Claire, our director, told me that I have to get his pants off him even if it means pushing him down on the couch and taking them off of him myself.. Believe it or not, the scene is not sexual in the slightest way.   You should see it. It'll be good.  Plus you'll see six plays for $3. Not bad, eh?

I feel like poo.. Only colder. ...Like a pile of poo buried in snow...no, not good snow, the icky kind of snow that's along the sides of the road... Ya know, it's all black eewy-looking...  I'd been wanting to post this ever since I first read it, but I kept forgetting... Better late than never!   All guys have to read  Jeeves's  most recent entry (February 15) and take notes.  He could make any girl swoon... She is so lucky... ;)  hehe, and the best part is this:  ". . . I wanted to explain something about the roses to you. The reason that I only got 6 instead of 12. Well... I have six more coming for you... but I'll only give them to you when we're together forever."   Mad props for Jeeves.

Catch-22  is playing in Morgantown on March 4... ..From their website:  Thu. Mar 4 - Morgantown, WV @ 123 Pleasant Street w/ Big D and the Kids Table   Hehehe...    IF  I could drive... I'd so be there...  *snap*  I need to driiiiiiiive...  ....and it's on a school night....  ...pssssshhhh!...   I need to convince someone with a car to go...  :D  Whoopie...

       Listening to - Anime on Cartoon Network.. too lazy to change the channel.. not that there is anything better on...  On my mind - I have to go to sleep...  I think I want a tattoo. Yep,  I  want a tattoo... Yes, the same person who always said she was too indecisive to ever get a tattoo...  I think I want it to be of the constellation Orion. There won't be much to it--just the dots (or maybe stars) that make up the constellation. No lines connecting them or anything...   Why a constellation, and why Orion?  ...Well, it's no secret that I looove the stars and the sky and that I loooooove to just stare at the stars. I've always loved Orion more than any other constellation; I don't know why... I just love it!   Whenever I gaze at the stars the first two constellations that I look for are Ursa Major (the Big Dipper) and Orion.

       Listening to -They Might Be Giants "Boss of Me" (..the theme song of Malcom in the Middle.)  On my mind - Wheeeee!  Today was a good day... No, no today was a fucking awesome day!    Actually, it was a pretty normal day until I got home and got online.  Amy is going to job shadow for  urlLink DC101 's  urlLink Elliot (as in Elliot in the Morning). How freaking awesome is that!?   The other thing that made my day was... well, I'm not going to say until later... :)  ...However, if you are a person who I often talk to in real life, feel free to ask me what it is... :-D  As for yesterday.. It was a crazy day... Crazy, crazy day.  It's a bit long and I'm feeling a bit to giddy to type, much less stay on one subject for a length of time. I'll just say it involved evactuating the school (after school hours), my going to the hospital, and hopes (of the much of student body) being squashed.     Tabitha-"..You're like Jesus's sidekick or something." Jordan - "Ashley is the conscience of the entire student body."  ...Hahaha... right.....

Bah!  ..Well, I haven't  juuust  being doing homework.. ...I've been constantly refreshing and checking on what going on at  TEOTI . ...I swear that place is a drug. Once you get into you can't stay away at any cost.. It's horrible..  Well, I'm off to the shower...  Good morning all!

       Listening to - The New Radicals "I Don't Wanna Die Anymore"  On my mind - ...blah...  I really don't want to go to school tomorrow.. I have so much homework to do. I've been so lazy.  Ugh. I hate this.  I still haven't even started my tech project for Theatre2. It was due Friday, but we did not have school... G is going to be pissed. Hopefully, he won't drag it out and will leave it be after the class is over for the day--I mean, he won't drag it into my other theatre class or into rehearsals.  I'm in such a shitty mood. Everything sucks. ...And no one is on to talk to.

      "The demon is in the china!"   Hehe. I think that is going to be my motto..   (If you have no idea what I am talking about, then you obviously have not read all of the post titled "Nightmares rock!" which is eleven posts below this one.)  It is just so random and makes no sense. Hehe, I love it!  ..example of future uses:  --"Holy shit, Ashley! (Insert catastrophe/calamity) has just happened! What do you think we should do?! --"Hm, I don't know, but, 'The demon is in the china!'"  --"Oh, wow. Well, I never considered it from that point of view."  ...See! It could be revolutionary!  ...I'm a genius!....

I'm pretty sure I have established that I love my dreams, right? ..And I do! My dreams are so awesome.. So if I love my dreams so much, why don't I ever sleep (at night)?  ..I don't know either. I don't make sense to myself...  ...I was Big Fish today! ...I was different from what I expected, but I still was good. I cried a lot during it, which is highly unusual for me.. (Eh, oh well..)  Please excuse the sucky update(s)....

       Listening to - music videos on VH1  On my mind - I heart West Virginia! :D  Reoccurring dreams are the best.  Last night I had one that I remember having at least once before.  It was weird. ..I'm not going to try to describe it here; I'm just going to say that it took place at a very, very, very odd bowling ball factory.... But it started out as some cheap end of a very small town in the middle of nowhere that I was seeking refuge in from.. someone.. I can't remember, and I don't think I was too sure in the dream either. It had the basically same plot as before, but this time I died very differently... well, I didn't actually die, but I was a cliffhanger, so I think it is best to assume that I did...  I love my dreams!

       Listening to - Futurama  On my mind - ...I need to lose some weight.. :/ Has anyone ever noticed that Gunter (the monkey made super-intelligent by his electronium hat) from Futurama and the evil monkey that lives in Chris's closet from Family Guy look suspiciously alike? Hmmmm?  ..Wait, nevermind. They don't..  I was looking for pictures of them so I could show the similarities, and noticed, when side-by-side, they only look alike because they are both cartoon monkeys.  (sigh)

       Listening to - Futurama  On my mind - "...pleeease no schoool....pleeeease no schoool..."  Aight, I'm subscribed to this email service that emails me whenever  urlLink Whitetail  is going to get snow.  I got one today. No biggie; I knew snow was in the forecast. But what grabbed my attention was the amount of snow...   urlLink Have a lookie..  (sorry about the size)  ...Read that again... 13 inches tonight! 13 INCHES! Wheee!  ...Yes, I do know that forecast is for Whitetail which is about 30 minutes to an hour away, depending on the driver, but there cannot be too great of a difference for the weather here.

       Listening to - Futurama Season 1 DVD.. :) ...Tim let me borrow it...  On my mind - "...no school tomorrow, no school tomorrow, no school tomorrow..."  Tonight we are supposed to get snow and iceage ..supposedly starting this evening. So all after-school activites were cancelled tonight.  Know what that means? ...No rehearsal!  ..For the first time in at least a month or so I had nothing to do in the evening... Wheee!  ..Actually, it has been boring as hell, but, hey!, at least I didn't have to stay after school for three hours.

It's such a great show. The Hallmark Channel shows it a lot. It's the only thing on that channel that doesn't suck royal ass.  I'm eating some really ripe cheese. It's mozzerella, but, man, it has some strong kick to it.   Headaches suck.

       Listening to - tv and stuff  On my mind - I hate being in emo moods...  I had my first nightmare in a couple years today. Oddly, I love it.  It freaked me out a lot, but it was great.  I was going to try and describe it, but it's too hard. So, I'll just tell you the ending (and scaryish part) as: I was in an old house which I had never been in before yet was familar with (I have been dreaming about this house for a while now) which was haunted, I was there with three men in their fourties or fifties (who in the dream I had first met earlier in the day, although I never actually dreamed about meeting them) and a woman, who was about the same age and was a combination of my stepmom and a random friend of the family and a little bit of my mom--earlier in the dream, she was my stepmom. I apparently was spending the night there at that house, so the lady asked if what room I wanted to stay in because it was a very large house. I chose the room closest to the top of the stairs, which oddly was also across the hall from the overly-fluorescent kitchen. I chose this room because it was unique because it had no windows to the outside but had window; the windows overlooked the room (the living room?, parlor?) below. I was in that room being to get ready to go to bed when I heard a very unnerving sound (I can't remember for sure, but I think it was combination weird of a thump, and gasp, a woman's eerie moan). I ran out of the room to find one of the men in the kitchen leaning nonchalantly against the doorframe suggestly that he was quite used to the sound. Another of the men was walking casually toward the man in the kitchen and was about the start talking to him. The third man and the lady came quickly either from another room or from deeper in the darkened hallway, both seeming startled and concerned. I asked the woman, "Was that her?" and she nodded. I asked, "Is that room [the room I was staying in] the worse?". Again she nodded, and she asked if I wanted I stay in another room; I nodded. She and the man who she entered the area with began walking towards the stairs and she said to me something to the effect of, "Let's go take care of this"... or something like that... I followed the two of them down the stairs where. At the base of stairs we paused as we looked around for the source of the sound; we all knew it was from a ghost or something of that sort. We saw a faint vertical area of fog which was coming towards us. As a group, we moved out of its way, but then it started coming towards me. The man said, "Oop, well, I guess it didn't want to go that way," as I circled around him to stand on his other side. The specter still followed me, so the man grabbed me and tightly hugged me said, "Make it think we're one mass." The ghost seemed to be somewhat angered by this; it rose riser in the air, forcing the man to look up at it. It seemed to want to attack him, and unconsciously, he and I both stopped hugging each other, and I stepped back some. He began forcefully shouting the numbers 12 and 23 at it. ("12! 23! 12! 23! 23! 12! 12! 23! 12!") This had little effect on the ghost. A "sprout" branched off of the main foggy area to something out of my field of vision. The ghostly image began glowing a feirce greenish color which then surrounded the man. He seemed shocked and in pain, and he pointly with a look of intense horror in the direction that the sprout was going off in and shouted, "The demon is in the china!" ...At that point I knew it was a dream and knew I had to wake up although I did not want to do so. I knew it was bright and sunny outside, as I had woken up a several hours before that just long enough to look at the clock. ..So I did open my eyes.. My heart was beating pretty fast, and I was comforted to know that my lovely kitty was laying fast asleep by my feet. ..Still, I closed my eyes and sleep again...... That didn't work... ...So I got up and brushed my teeth...  I love dreaming..    That was waay longer than I wanted it to be... Eh.. Oh well!

       Listening to -  The Simpsons    I have a 31% in Algebra 2... a 31%... ...In one of my best (and favorite) classes/subjects....  In December I had a 100% in that class...  What happened?...  ...I think it's because I stopped doing my homework..  I probably should start doing it again...  We just started doing stuff with imaginary numbers and complex numbers, and it's pretty easy...  I wasn't in class when Mrs. Davis explained it yesterday, and I didn't do the homework for it last night... I picked up on it just from class today when she was going over the homework, so I don't have any worries about it... But, still, I should do it...   G yelled at me today for having so many absences that I can't go to State Competition. ....Jordan was disappointed that I couldn't go because I wouldn't be there to "amuse" him... Cory (one of the chicks that I was going to room with there--along with Claire and Gabi) acted thrilled that I couldn't go... hehe... I'm loved... :) I asked G if I would still be allowed to get out of my classes for the in-school perfomances of  Mockingbird , and he said that he was pretty sure that I could. Yay... I think...   I'm getting so sick of everything...  Blah....  I have to go to  Mockingbird  rehearsal on Thursday to have headshots taken... Joy... :/   Oh, and Friday, the scene that I am directing is being performed... I'm nervous...

Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.   Cut out the article.   Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.   Shake it gently.   Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag.   Copy conscientiously.   The poem will be like you.   And here you are a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the vulgar.    -Tristan Tzara   I didn't use any of the proper nouns and adjectives just to see how it would look. I'll make another tomorrow with the proper nouns and adjectives in there.

       Listening to - tv  I'm in a wonderful mood. I want to paint..   I want to create something.  I feel like covering my room in drop cloths and painting a huge picture...without using brushes.. just my hands... Mmmmm... :) ..And I actually have an idea for a painting... It's so rare that I have an idea for something... I should probably sketch it out before I forget it...   Maybe sometime this week I'll go to an art store and see how much canvas costs... All I have are those stupid canvas boards. I hate them... ...There's something about painting on canvas which has been stretched by myself that I absolutely love...  I really want to paint...  It's like a hunger...  It's killing me... I need to do it... ....Even if am forced to paint on stupid little canvas boards...   It's 4AM and I have to walk my aunt's dog (which I am dog-sitting for most of the week) in the morning....  Maybe I should sleep... or something...

       Listening to - SNL  I went to my cousin's (Janelle) wedding today...  Wow. It was nice... Kinda boring at first, but good... The ceremony was at University of Maryland's chapel... I had a really hard time pretending to be interested. :After that we went to a country club for the reception.. There we stood around for at least an hour.. people were mingling, listening to the string trio playing, getting drinks from one of the three (free!) bars, and munching on hors d'oeuvres. Then we finally went into the dining room place... There was a 10-piece band and three singers. (They rocked! They played everything from big band swing to Louis Armstrong to Sinatra to broadway tunes to No Doubt--yes, No Doubt...) ...Then we were served a super-yummy 5-course meal...   ....Bah, I'm rambling, I think...  I'm bored... And tired...  Oh, that "bad news" from yesterday is that Ramsey (my history teacher) said that he was going to make sure that I don't go on the theatre trip to the State Thespian Festival because I have had too many absences this semester...  Bah.. Don't teachers usually let their favorite students get away with more than their other students? ...Ramsey has said several times that I am one of his favorites... So, why won't he just turn his head away and ignore this?  (Yeah, I already know the answer... Because he is concerned about my grades and stuff... Bah!.... Stupid teachers that give a damn...hehe) I've been looking forward to going for a year now... ever since I got back from the trip last year...  ...G is going to kill me...   I need sleep...

       Listening to - Evan and Jaron, "Crazy For This Girl"  I love this song. It makes me so happy. ..Today makes me happy. It is so beautiful. It is so warm. I have the window open right now so I can smell the fresh air and warm breeze... plus the house is beginning to smell weird--not bad but not entirely pleasant either--after being shut up all winter...   I love spring...  ...I feel so happy today...  And I think it is completely because of the weather because today's events seemed like they'd be enough to put me in a less than terrific mood on any other day.  ..Oh, and I also must declare my affection for boys. (Except Corbin; I really wish that he would just give up...) Really, the simple, goofy things that they do by nature are so great... But maybe that's because I'm already in a semi-euphoric mood...   I'm reading  Lirael , sequel to  Sabriel , and, oh!, it is sooo gooooood! :) I love books...  (Alright, now I'm kinda mad. When I was getting the link for Lirael, I was glancing over the comments, and some ass gave away the story...Bah...)  I'm also totally loving this mood I'm in. Not only am I so amazing happy, I'm also in a lovely mood that makes me want to take me camera, pack a simple dinner, and go hiking in the woods--either on the Appalachian Trail or the C&O Canal...  I need to go take some pictures.. I still haven't had a chance to get some good use out of my camera since I got it on Christmas... :\ It's sitting right here beside the computer begging for me to take it somewhere... Poor thing..   Oh, and I kind of dressed up today. Today was the first day that I didn't wear a t-shirt to school in, I think, several years. I wore a simple white shirt with spaghetti straps with a button-up shirt that was white with thin, light pink stripes and left it unbuttoned. And I wore some brand new jeans..the kind that look really faded. ...Oh god! I loved it. ..And I had my hair up and was wearing my glasses... hehe, Not to be conceited, but I looked damn good! :D  ...And I guess I still do since the only difference now is that I am wearing pajama pants with adorable black kitties on them... :)  Yay!  ...There's some bad news, but I'll post that later as not to spoil the joy of this post...

       Listening to - Conan  From Aaron's livejournal: "I don't want people to look back at their high school years and think of me as some hot guy. I WANT TO BE MORE THAN THAT!!..."   Aw, hugs for the hot guy... I mean Aaron....  I knew you before I thought you were hot...  ...But with extreme hotness such as yours, it's hard for people to not remember you for your godly good looks...   ...Sorry... I'm bored...

       Listening to - Conan!  ...I'm sure all of you know that I am not exactly the fastest go-kart on the track.. ....But, wow, how could I not notice this... In 7th period, I had the people that I am directing (Bryan, Leia, and Corbin) read through the scene. I knew there was a lot of sexual innuendo in the scene... But I missed a few things... Especially something in one of Bryan's lines... Here's a snippet of what I am talking about  JOE (Bryan). I heard about that in health class. We had to do a paper on what makes a hormone. NURSE RATCHED (Leia). And what makes a hormone? JOE. I don't know. I got an F. Is that a good grade? NURSE RATCHED. Oh, I like a good F.    tehehe... If you didn't get it, read Bryan's first line aloud... I hope you got the 'F' thing....   Hahahah... Today, Corbin asked me on a date for tomorrow night...  Hahah... Why doesn't he just give up? .... He even said he wasn't going to give up.... I really hope that he loses interest soon... :/

Then Mom and I went shopping. ...We got so much stuff... We probably spent about $300...  .... Yay! :)  It doesn't feel like I should have to go to school tomorrow...  Oh! And no rehearsal tomorrow! :D Oh Oh! Tomorrow night, I'm staying at Joanna's because my mom is going to Charleston, and she doesn't think I can be alone for a whole night or whatever.... :\

       Listening to - "Drinking for 11", The Mad Caddies  I was at school today--a Saturday--from 8 until about 5.... longer than I am there on a school day...  We placed and are going to state competition. I wasn't surprised. We rock.   I didn't do anything during the show though... In the program I am listed as being the Sound Operator and Angie is the Assistant Sound Operator, but she does everything during the show... Well, I used to do everything, but when I came back on Thursday after being sick, G wanted to run it with all the added sound effects, and Angie asked if she could run sound since she knew how to do it and let me do sound effects which she didn't know how to do... So I agreed... But after we did one run through with the sound effects, G cut them... leaving me with nothing to do during the show... I always ask Angie if there's anything I could do, but she says that she's got it covered.  ...So the only thing I do for the play now is checking levels before we start. :\  I feel so unneeded... And I was kinda pissed after the show just because it is so pointless for me to be there. ...G asked me what was wrong and I, as usual, denied anything was wrong... I thought I was doing a good job of hiding it... ....Damn him... He's good.   Berkeley Springs did  Actor's Nightmare ... It wasn't as good as our version of it. (Go Claire and Jordy!...and Jessica and Leia and Michael... :)  Oh.. Gabi, the exchange student from Argentina, was there. ...She is so cute... I just want to eat her up. :)  Oh! Oh! ...Tim Lloyd said I was a God ... And (...completely unrelated...) Kyle and Beans were calling me 'Allah' and kneeling and bowing and groveling to me and all that stuff...  ...xint and I mentioned starting a cult so we can be rich... ....I guess I already have three followers... :)

       Listening to - Leno... (there's never anything good on tv on fridays...)  Corbin really pisses me off. Really, really pisses me off. ( See post from March 5th )  Last Friday was the last time that I really yelled at him. ...He was sitting in during our last rehearsal for  Actor's Nightmare  and he was, as usual, being an ass. ...But later that night, while I was waiting to audition of  To Kill A Mockingbird , he came up to me and somewhat apologized and told me he'd try not to piss me off if I would be nicer to him... So for the past week I have been very polite towards him.  ...But today... oh man... After seventh period, as I am getting ready for rehearsal at the back of the auditorium, he is sitting in the middle of it with Elise (who does the most awesome artwork... I want to marry some of her paintings.. not really...). He turns around and tells me that he had a dream about me last night; in the dream he was a Hardy boy and I was the Nurse (referring to the scene that I am directing with him in it). And he told me that it was very nice... in a tone that implied more than that the scene went well... (....Are you following what I am saying here?...) ...I just told him to stop right there. Then he walked out of the auditorium, and I said to CJ (lighting guy), who was standing beside me and chuckling at what Corbin had said, that I hated Corbin and he just chuckled some more...  ....A few minutes later, I was walking back to the soundboard after going to G's room, I heard Corbin talking, but I figured he was talking to Elise so I didn't pay attention what he was saying.... But I decided to look up anyway... And he was talking to me.. Almost immediately after I realized that he was talking to me, he finished what he was saying... All I caught of what he said was him almost begging me to be his girlfriend... "...I'll never cheat on you! I'm always nice to you! Come on!..."  ...Pathetic, huh?...  After rehearsal, everyone was helping clean up for tomorrow (Regional Thespian Competition). I had already finished my assigned task (sweeping the main hallway) and Corey asked me to wash the windows at the main entrance--the same area where Corbin was hanging out... I don't feel like going through everything he said and did. But one thing really got to me.... I went outside to wash the outside of the windows, and after I did Corbin was proclaiming that he had been hitting on me and--get this--that he had gotten to first base (kissing, right?) with me and (according to Michael) that by tonight he was going to get to home base with me... Needless to say, that really, really pissed me off...   Bah...   Oh, I'm Dillon's subsitute girlfriend now for whenever Caitlyn (sp.?) isn't in eyesight... Haha, yeah don't ask...  Oh... Michael said that Claire and I were cute.. tehe...   OH OH OH! ...If you're not doing anything tomorrow at 1, come see  Wings . I swear, it's gonna rock... ...Throughout the whole play, Pink Floyd's  Umma Gumma  plays... How could it not be good?...

Happy Birthday Justino!  ...oh, and it's one month until my birthday... wheee! Oh, and I already have birthday plans... For about 5 or 6 hours, I'll be sitting on a bus on the way back from the State Thespian Festival in Charleston! Wheee... :/  I didn't go to school today either. I could have, but didn't.  Parent-Teacher conferences are tonight, and Mom is going... I'm scared...

G posted the cast list.  ...I don't think many people were happy...  Taylor didn't get a part at all... I know she's majorly bummed...  Some people who got parts--pretty decent parts--aren't very good at acting, (IMHO), and are not very responsible...  G was actually nice about letting me leave school today. Yay for him having a heart!...   Oh, and it snowed this morning... It's raining now though. :(

       Listening to - "Jeopardy"  Bah, I hope the cast list for  Mockingbird  doesn't look anything like the call-back list.  I hope G is just humoring some of those people...  There were some terrible actor(ess)s that got call-backs.  I didn't but I wasn't expecting one.  I was hoping to have nothing to do this spring... But, Beth somehow got me to do sound for it... But, thank goodness, I'll be doing it alone, so no one will be there to annoy me... ...I think that's why I despise  Wings  so much... Angie (the other sound tech) annoys me...  .......a lot....  I'm still sick...   The ability to breathe through the nose is taken for granted way too often...

       Listening to -  School of Rock   The play was alright. We did good, but the audience hardly laughed... The most we got (that we could hear on stage) were a few chuckles here and there. At one part--when Jordan takes off his pants--I came on too early and forgot my first line after I came on there...  ...But no one noticed... Not even our director...  Last night I typed up the first scene of the play that I am directing--I'm directing the second scene of it-- but it disappeared. :( I might redo it tonight.  Oh, and I like my make-up. Leia did my make-up, as she always has for  Actor's Nightmare , and, tonight, I love it! I'm tempted to take a picture of myself, so I can look at it later and think, "Wow, I was hot that night!"...  I'm a dork.

Only a few people will be in the audience... so come and laugh at us... :)   To Kill A Mockingbird  auditions were today...  I was in the last group to audition.... ...Claire ended rehearsal at 4ish... so I had to wait for over 2 hours to do a cold reading of a short monologue. Bah...  I doubt I'm going to get a part... Not that I really want one (I didn't sign up to do tech so I can be lazy this spring :)  ...But Claire said that there are 18 parts in  Mockingbird , so I guess there is a decent chance that I would get a part...  ...I'll know on Monday...  I went to stations of the cross at church tonight...  I'm kinda glad I did, just because I got to see Bekah (and Justino and Bekah's parents...) ...Just yesterday I was thinking about how we never see each other and hardly ever talk... :Also, I think she kind of made me say that I was going to church on Sunday...  Meh... Bekah, If I am able to pull myself away from wherever I fall asleep on Saturday night (er, early Sunday morning..), I  WILL  be at church... :)

Two years ago, David and I were bored and talking online... He said something about boobs, and I told him how much I hate them and asked if he wanted them... He did. ...From that point on, he has been the sole owner of my boobs.. (Well, I suppose they are not really my boobs anymore...) ...And one day at lunch someone suggested that, since they belong to him, he should help me take care of them.. Or something like that.  He said he is going to take the bra into his art class to put something on it before he gives it to me... (I think his art class is printmaking...He might have another one also..) ...He showed me a print that he wanted to put on it...  Actually, it's kind of similar to the picture above this.. If I remember correctly, the print is of a stick-figurish head wearing headphones...   Hehe... I can't wait...   Oh! What are you doing on Saturday?! What?... That's crap! Don't do that.. Go see me in  Actor's Nightmare  at the Fine Arts Fesival at 4:20... (Yes, we already performed it once, but since we won the One-Acts, we have to do it again..) It'll be good...

There were leaves and small twigs flying at the house.  I could heard the trees around the house groaning and creaking.   ...Good stuff...

       Listening to -  High Fidelity   Good day today. Yay!  No rehearsal either.  Double good.  The kids in Theatre3 that want to get into Theatre4 (directing) next year--me being one of them--are going to "get a taste of directing". G paired us up to direct 3 or so of the non-potential-Theatre4 students. I got paired up with Dillon. (Yay! Our thingy is going to rock!) ...But Corbin is one of the actors. (Damn, it is going to suck.) ....Corbin is such a fucking asshole..... (And he knows that I hate him; yet, he still acts really nice to me and hits on me. Fucking ass...)  Ok...Happy thoughts again....  Yay! Directing!! ...with Dillon!

       Listening to - the Daily Show  I wish I had a digital camera so I could upload some of my pictures...  ....Or a dark room and a scanner...  ....Hm, a scanner would be nice.

       Listening to - something on TV.. I haven't been paying any attention to it...  Ok, so wearing my glasses two days in a row was too much. As soon as I got home I put in my contacts. They are such a relief. ...I don't understand how some people can always wear glasses.. Bah!..  Aaron has a  LiveJournal ... which is not helping my addiction of reading other peoples blogs/LJs/diarys/whatever... (...I hope he doesn't mind me posting the link..) Oh, and he mentioned me in his LJ...twice! ...Hehe, I always feel so special when people mention me! :) hehe  I need valium... No, not for me. It's for the girl that is helping me do sound for  Wings , Angie. She likes a 5-year-old on speed.. only more energetic.... She does not stand still! She is always trying too hard to do stuff; she is really persistent. She stands, literally, an inch away from me. She thinks she's hilarious, but she's not even remotely funny--not in the slightest way! And she is always talking to me and asking questions, especially at times when I have to concentrate on what is going on onstage and/or the volumes of the actors/mics/music/sound effects... Bah.... I was trying so hard not to yell at her today.. ...I hate yelling at people.. I hate even being assertive... :\  ...Honestly... I don't know how much longer I can deal with this chick...  Bah...  I'm whiny...

Today has been a good day. ...Well, Theatre 3 and rehearsal were somewhat sour because G was kind of mad at me--I miss too much school and when I'm not absent, I'm tardy... Also, rehearsal was in the cafeteria today because the dance team had the stage. Blah...   Anyway, I came in about 5 minutes before first period ended, so I just wandered around the building until the classes changed... I hate first period so much...  I wore my glasses today--for the first time in school since november, at the latest, and I got several compilments on them. Yay... :) Maybe I'll wear them more often...   Right before 7th period was over, Dillon, Kyle, and I went to Dillon's car.... Bah, I can't even do justice if I describe everything that went on... It was hilarious! ....And we nearly got into 3 or 4 car accidents in the school parking lots, two of them because of Cory and Caitlin (Dillon's girlfriend) trying to piss Dillon off... ...*sigh*...Funny stuff...   ...Sorry that this is so jumpy... Like I said, I'm watching "Kingdom Hospital"... It's pretty good...   Rehearsal was fun. Since it was in the cafeteria, I was sitting right in front of where the action was, instead of being all the way in the back of the auditorium, and I was 'talking' to the actors and the flats (you should see the play to understand)... Good stuff...   I'm cold...   ....And it wasn't even cold outside today...   ...Oh! And I walked barefoot outside today for the first time (well, the first time without my feet going numb) since last autumn.  Happiness!

       Listening to - Bad Religion, "American Jesus"   Alright, so I was a page today. Not too interesting in itself.  I just got sodas for 3 guys and delivered a note to someone. But I was interesting to watch them on the floor, debating and voting and stuff... It was so much cooler than watching the Senate or House feeds on CSPAN... (Yep, I actually do that...)  The first time that I got sodas for a guy, a regular coke,(and the guy sitting beside of him, a diet coke)... When I brought them back, the man beside him, who was a average-looking healthy guy, asked me  if he needed to drink diet soda. Of course I said no, because, well, he honestly didn't and it would be unkind to tell someone that they need to... (unless it was a 300+ pound cow shoving his/her face with a cake... then it should be a civil duty..) He chuckled. And the other guy, who was a, um, bigger (not disgustingly obese though) and older--definitely out of shape-- asked me if he need to drink soda. I replied, "No! Of course not!" and gave him a huge semi-sarcastic smile. He just started laughing, the guy beside him was laughing also and he shouted, "She lies! She lies!"  At that point I just lost it and started cracking up...  Haha, It was pretty funny!  ...Sorry that I suck I telling stories...

       Listening to - Pet Shop Boys, "If Looks Could Kill"  Sorry, this is guaranteed to be pathetic. :)  ...I'm just in one of those moods... Well, It's a rant, I suppose...  Read at your own risk.  ...You have been warned... ......If you keep reading you won't be able to turn back... ....Are you sure? ......Are you sure that you're sure? .....Really?... Well, ok, here goes....   On the way down to Charleston, we were listening to various CDs...  One we listened to was my Third Eye Blind CD (their self-titled one). ...That is one on my favorite CDs... It just reminds me of happy, carefree summers.. Ah, good times... (Then later we listened to Dashboard Confessional, which didn't really help...) Anyway, I also made me think of Matt.. And how happy we were; well, how happy I was and how happy he pretended to be and how happy he told me he was... *sigh* ...And how suddenly he just broke up with me..  I still don't understand that.  He was like 'I'm happy with 'us'!'...'I love you so much!'.... And he was talking about after we graduate from high school--which was 2 years away at the time-- that he wanted to take me to Florida so we could go to Universal Studios and go to some beaches and do 'romantic' things like that...  Then about two weeks after the idea to go to Florida, he basically broke up with me...  (Read  here  and  here  for more info. NOTE: Hindsight is 20/20. And what I wrote there is very flawed. ..Then read  this .) ...It's crap, right?   I think I just need some closure...  The last time I talked to him was when I called him (see the second link above)...  Also... Sadly, I'm pretty sure that I am becoming desperate for a boyfriend, just for the sake of having one... I know that's what is bringing on these thoughts... ...But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I should just forget about him.. We disagree on religious and political issues that I am very adamant on...  ...But also, we have almost the exact same sense of humor, and anyone who knows me at all knows humor is a biggie for me... We both have very diverse musical tastes. ...He's one of the few guys I know that will be grooving to a Skankin' Pickle song one minute, then doing a line dance to a Rascal Flatts song the next. (...Hot damn, I love 4-H boys!...) But, it's just confusing... Why did he break up so suddenly and unexpectedly? ...Bah...   I'm pathetic...   I'm sorry if you actually read that.. . I kind of lost my train of thought in the middle of it, so I apologize if it didn't make much sense...    ....  §®ægådørë®§¤ says: hahhahahhahahhaahahhahaahhahahha Ashly's drunk  AshyAsh says: damn you!  AshyAsh says: i'm just dumb!    Oh! Another random thing... G says our fall and spring shows will both be musicals next year to get grant money. (In the fall a girls' musical, and in the spring a guys' musical.) Know what this means... My senior year, the best part that I can hope for is an extra, or maaayabe a walk-on...      ...C'est la vie...

Plus I just painted my toenails, and they are still wet...  ...Maybe I should hurry up and get ready... Joanna is picking me up at 12:30...  ...See you tomorrow or Wednesday!

       Listening to - Jack Off Jill, "Strawberry Gashes"  I just spilled an entire container of French Onion dip on the kitchen floor. Yes, I know; I'm smoooth.   The whole kitchen reeks of sour cream and onions now.   I signed up for a Gmail email account. Spiffy, huh? You could email me there. (AshyAsh--at--gmail.com) My inbox there looks awfully lonely.   I'm taking the SAT tomorrow. I'm actually looking forward to it. I've always been very good at standardized tests.   I got my digital camera on Monday. It's nice. I like it.  I might post some pics of my art when I get some of my recent favorites back from my art teacher--they're hanging on the bulletin board in her classroom.   I'm bored. No one is online.  No One .

       Listening to - music videos a' la MTV...  I have been in bed for 5 hours trying -- without success -- to go to sleep... This is crazy... Around 6, I pulled out  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn , but that just made me do more thinking than I was already doing.  ...Life is rough. I feel so sorry for the people in this book. They get by, but it's rough.   I'm definitely taking a year or so off before going to college. I'm so sick of school. I think I need to experience real life first. Hopefully get a place of my own -- with a room mate, I'm sure -- and just fend for myself. Get a feel for life before I decide what I want to do with mine.  ....Can you tell that I need sleep?   If I can find any medicine that isn't non-drowsy here, I think I'm going take some and hope it knocks me out.  I know; that is so uncharacteristic of me.

       Listening to - Toby Keith, "Beer for My Horses"  I started reading  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn  this week.  Great book. I'm only on page 60 or so--haven't been reading much--but I love it. It shows both how wonderful life can be and how hard it can be. It's so great. You should read it, everyone should read it.   ...Apparently some kid that recently graduated from our school killed his stepdad. That's just about all anyone was talking about today. The stepdad came into the kid's house or something looking for drugs. They got into an argument. And the kid stabbed the stepdad.... That's most of what I picked up... Here's the  article  on it. The way people were talking about it seemed like he killed him out of anger or whatever, but the article makes it seem more like self-defense, maybe. It's amazing how in 10 years this area can go from being a small, quiet, farming county to having murders almost daily -- I know, that's not a big deal to anyone from a city, but compared to how this area looks, it's shocking -- and finding bodies of people in rivers and along the Applachian Trail and C&O Canal and having some huge drug busts--not in some run-down house in the shitty part of town, but in the fooking parks!  ...Sorry, rambling wasn't I?...  Oh, A thunderstorm is beginning. :D Yay!

       Listening to - Van Morrison, "Moondance"   Mmm.... Jason Mraz is playing in DC on May 27. ...That's the night before finial exams begin... :(  G said I don't have to start coming to rehearsals for  Mockingbird  until sometime in May.  I got the feeling today that I wasn't actually needed at all, which doesn't bother me at all.  G said that Ben is doing sound also (I was so excited about doing it by myself and not having to put up with anyone's crap) and that there are only a few sound effects plus some stage mics that we'll be using.  Two people are defintely not needed. I'll ask G sometime if he actually needs/wants me.  Being unneeded does not bother me at all... Especially when it means that I will have more free time than I can shake a stick at.  I'm bored. Bah.  ...Save me?...

       Listening to - Conan... but "This is a Crime Scene" is playing in my head...  I've had this song stuck in my head for the past week or two... Maybe doing this will get it out.  It's "This is a Crime Scene"  by  Shindig . ( urlLink Download it. )   tonight, finally i draw the line. you've left me bloodied up and broken down too many times. to say that what you did was wrong is the understatement of all time and never to be outdone.  don't say a word. just close your eyes and press your lips to mine.  one more kiss and i'll fall dead to the floor. kill me now so i don't have to watch you leave. tie me up, cut me deep with that sharp tongue in your mouth. this time it's worth dying over you.  through your lips i can taste your poison heart. all hollowed and black and marred, left bitter from the start. each breath is getting harder to breathe, it's funny how what gives you life is taking it from me.  so watch me die. break out the yellow tape. string it up and chalk my outline on the floor. make no mistake, it's you that has to live with my blood on your hands from what you did.

       Listening to -  Whose Line...?   Skipped school again today. ...What's new? I think I am going to take a year off after I graduate before going to college. The idea of still having five straight years of school bums me out. I read an article today saying that when people take a year off they always do better in college no matter what they do during that year off. I really need that. I'll probably just get a job and save for college. I hope I can get a decent job. I couldn't stand having to work some shitty job like one at McD's or a place like that. ...Even a mailroom job at some place in D.C. sounds kind of interesting.... I also need to figure out what the hell I want to do--like what kind of career I want when I get out of college...  I got my hair cut tonight. It's a bit below my shoulders now. ..Quite a change. I think I like it though; it still feels too weird to tell. It frames my face a lot. I think I like that...  I'm supposed to get my digital camera on Monday. Get ready for dumb pictures. :)  Oh, and what's up with the column on the right? ..I don't know. I don't feel like figuring it out... Hopefully it will fix itself, again. :)

       Listening to - Dead Prez, "Happiness"  Yay! I'm so happy. I don't know why. Just am.  I didn't bother going to sleep last night.  I kind of like when I don't sleep because I get all giddy and it takes very little to make me crack up. ...But also I get kind of depressed, but that's just from lack of sleep...   I got a five-hour nap not long after I got home today. It was great.  I woke up when one of my aunt's came over to give me my birthday present--a super-cute little crystal cat. It is so cute; I love it! :D  I'm tired. I need to go to bed at a decent time tonight.  ...But we all know what I need to do and what I actually do are usually two completely different things. :/   ...I like the Dead Prez. They make rap cool.... :)

       Listening to - Tori Amos, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" :)  So, wanna know what I did on my birthday? I went to my dad's because I do that every other saturday-- it is usually boring... Anyway, my dad, stepmom and I went to a fooking car show... :/  While we were there I had a sandwich and they had BBQ chicken... So we were all full...  Then we went back to my dad and stepmom's house and watched the first part (of 4) of  Shogun ... Everyone involved in the making of that movie should be shot... It was horrible... But it allowed me to have decent nap... after the movie finished... my dad was the only one hungry, so we didn't go out to dinner as we had planned to do...    ....And everyone here has left to go out to dinner.... but Bill (my mom's b/f person) is going... and I absolutely hate him... so... I'm suck at home by myself on my birthday  :(  But, I've already gotten $130 bucks for my birthday.. I'm thinking about putting that all--plus the $20 bucks that I already had-- towards a digital camera..  ...But, If I'd just smiled and nodded, I would have one now... My dad said he was thinking of getting one for me for my birthday, but I had said that I wanted a 5 megapixel camera... Stupid Ashley! ...A 3.3 megapixel (which is what he recently got himself) would have done fine! .....stupid me...  I'm thinking about maybe auditioning for  Much Ado About Nothing  tomorrow... I don't know if I really want to though... ..And if I happened to get a part, I'd have to manage being in that and doing sound for  To Kill A Mockingbird .  Bah, I have to start going to rehearsals for  Mockingbird  next week.... At least I'll be doing sound by myself, that makes it so much better.... :)

       Listening to - CNN  "You have 54 new email messages" ...What I lovely greeting to get from MSN Messenger when I am already halfway asleep, have a horrible headache, and am pretty temperamental as a result...  54 fooking emails... some are from eariler this week and I have been putting them off... Some I'm sure need replies.. Heh, I know there is a few from a couple of weeks ago that I should have replied to...  Why aren't I taking a nap right now?  ...Good question...  I don't know the answer.   I got some pictures back today that I took of flowers (..and a couple dead birds..) in the rain a week or two ago... They're preeeety... I'm proud.  :D Hehe, and Mom said that Jeremy is getting me something camera related for my birthday.. But there is nothing that I need that is close to being under $100... well except filters...   I need sleep.  I'm really jumpy also.  ...Don't sneak up on me...

       Listening to - Dave Matthews Band, "Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"  I hate school. I really hate it. Well, not all of it. Just my first three classes (Science [which I failed last year b/c I am a lazy bum], Theatre2 [technical theatre], and English), which the thought of having to sit through them causes me to wake up in a bad mood on school days.  But Algebra (my 4th class), cheers me up. I love the logic and order and predictability. ...And the fact that I am good at it. ..that helps a lot... :) But, oh man my Drawing class (5th) is great. Why? Because I sit there and  draw ! (Right now we are doing perspective, and I'm not a fan of using rulers or anything I like. I like just using my eyes, so it's kind of boring for me now..) ...But you know what is great? Sandwiched (pun intended) in the middle of 5th period is my lunch. And I  love  the people that I sit with... Joanna, Amy, Aaron, David, Jeff, Harold... oh, it is so funny! So, there is very little chance that I am in a bad mood after lunch...  Then I go back and draw some more... In that class I sit with Cat and Allie. (She's straight-edge. oh yeah. mega-coolness.) Allie is so good at anything that involves artistic skills. Sometimes Cat and I just sit and watch her... until she notices that we are just stareing at whatever she's working on... Yeah, we're dorks... 20th Century U.S. History is next. I love that class! Mainly because I adore the subject, but also the teacher, Mr. Ramsey (who can be quite the asshole),  really knows his material and doesn't just teach the crap that is printed in the books. And he ties whatever we are learning about into current events (another of my favorite topics).  And 7th period, well, it's not great, but better than my first three... It's Theatre3 (acting). And we hardly do anything it that class. So, it's always a nice lazy way to end the day... Oh, oh today most of the class got in a really heated discussion about eating meat.. It started out as being about not being cruel to animals or something like that... Andrew (straight-edge and a vegetarian) had the only logical argument even though I'm not all about vegetarianism...  ...Alright I might write more later... My aunt is coming to pick me up to go out to dinner...

Tomorrow Mom and I are going to  Tyson's Corner . I guess I should be excited, but I'm not...  ...I really don't want to go to school on Tuesday..  .....And my birthday is Saturday, I'm not looking forward to that either.. :/ ...Aren't I such a party pooper?...

His hair there is as full and bushy as ever...  He's so cute.  He seems tired, but happy to be home.  I'm so glad he's back. I was lonely...  I really want to paint.  Hopefully tomorrow night I'll be able to get to an art supply store. ....Aaron wants me to give him the painting... ..I think I will....  ...If I actually finish it and am happy with it...  ....That seems unlikey.. :/

       Listening to - Andrew W.K., "Ready to Die"  Snuffy, my kitty, has been at the vet since Friday. No, big deal. He's just getting the outer part of the pin that held his leg together after it was mysteriously broken completely and very cleanly. That happened at the same time that half of his nose disappeared from his face... My poor cat is such a freak...  ..Anyway, I didn't expect the surgery to nearly as bad as his other ones.. I don't think it is.  Mom said that our vet's dog got hit, and he said that they were working on his dog and that it would take longer for them to get to Snuffy and that we'd probably get him back by Monday. Well, It's Wednesday, and there isn't a Snuffy whining to sit on my lap... I really miss him.  It's been too quiet.

       Listening to - The Fugees, "Killing Me Softly"  hehe. I got my first birthday present of the year today. The one from David. teheh ...*blush*... (Read my post from  urlLink March  9th.)  He gave it to me during lunch, and despite everyone wanting me to open it there, I waited until I got home to open it.   Tomorrow is my first day of Spring Break. Good Stuff. The fact that I didn't have to go to school tomorrow and could sleep in with no interruptions was the only thing that got me through today.   ...Know what's really weird. I woke myself up today. (Usually, I only awake when someone or something else wakes me up.) ..And not only did I wake up on my own, I woke up at  5:20 . Crazy stuff, huh?

I was about to give up on connecting this afternoon, when, voila!, I was online!  ...It's mega slow though... Well, just Teoti and MSN's email.... The only two site that I really go to.. ...Except this... Blogger didn't seem to bad... But I was fiddling with my speakers while it was loading, so I don't really know.  ...My speakers aren't working... They are plugged in.. The power light is on... And they are plugged into the correct place on the back of the computer.... I even plugged them in every possible place that they could go, just in case I was having some terrible lapse in memory/intelligence...  I am dying without music, or even the sound of people signing on and off...  Stupidness...  ...But, hey!, I'm online!   Update: I'm an idiot. I had the speakers muted via the 'Mute' button on the keyboard... I guess I muted it while on the phone yesterday then forgot about... I'm dumb.

I guess this really isn't his home anymore since he hasn't lived here for 9 years now...  Geez, kids grow up so fast... :)  I don't know whether to be happy or not..  On one hand, it's going to be cool to see my brother for the first time in, I think, a year or two... Maybe longer -- I don't remember...  But on the other hand, he's probably going to be bitching and making me do stuff, and blah... I don't know..  I wish there wasn't such an age gap between me and my brothers... I was eight when Scott moved out; ten when Jeremy did.  I don't know... There just wasn't much time for quality sibling bonding... All I really remember is getting beat up... Oh, But don't think that I don't cherish those memories... If any thing, they taught me how to defend myself :)  ...They also had a huge part in teaching me reading and writing and math... *sigh* Good times... I also remember that Jeremy was the one that taugh me how to correctly put on underwear....  Heh, I need sleep...

It didn't seem bad, so that means that I failed it horribly. That's how it always is--the better I feel I did on a test, the worse I actually do.. and vice versa to some extent..  Blue Man Group is on tv. Man, they are so awesome. I want to go see them live sometime...

       Listening to - the cicadas  Today was the last day for seniors. I can't help but think about how many of them I will probably never see again.  As I walked out of 7th period I said bye to Dan and he "Oh, I'll see you around!"... Yeah, I don't know when but whatever... Some of the nicest guys I have ever met are graduating this year... As well as some of the funnest chicks...  Eh, oh well... That's life, right?   ...And, I'm not as bummed out as I sound right now... :)

       Listening to - Belle and Sebastian, "I'm a Cuckoo"  Tomorrow is the last day for seniors.  I doubt that I will see most of them ever again. Kind of sad... ...Except Andrew, he said that since he lives close by he'll be at Jefferson at least twice a week. heh, goof... ...And I'm sure some of the people going to Shepherd might stop in once or twice to say hi to their old teachers...   Bah..  For our exam in Theatre3 we're doing scenes. I'm in a group with 4 other girls. Kind of hard to find a scene with parts for five girls and only five girls.. But we're doing the scene from Grease where Sandy and the Pink Ladies are in the bedroom drinking and trying to pierce Sandy's ears. I'm Jan... Brittany said I should be her because my personality fit the part.. or something.. Meh, I'm not complaining... It works for me... But the exam is Tuesday, so I have five days to learn the scene... Bah...   I wish G had us do monologues like he did for our first semester exam. I can learn those pretty quick--for first semester exam, I learned a page and a half monologue (it only had to be one minute, and mine went over that) in one night. :) And, I came across a really good monologue while searching for a scene. ...All I can remember about it is that the woman in it was a little eccentric -- but she still was all there -- and jumped quickly from topic to topic... I think I could pull that one off quite well.. :P  I lost my copy of  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn . That pissed me off... I don't really remember when I lost it, but I think I left it on top of the locker above mine -- I always put my book and bottle of water (whatever I am carrying) there while I get out my books -- between second and third periods, and I guess I forgot to get it... But I think I remember carrying to it third period -- I slept through nearly the entire class period... So, I dunno... I checked in lost and found, and it wasn't there... I'll check again tomorrow, and, if it's not there, then I am going to buy another copy... I only had 40 pages left to read and wanted to finish it today or tomorrow... But I guess I'll have to find another book to read during classes (the only time I read anymore) tomorrow... This really pisses me off... :/

       Listening to - Jason Mraz, "Summer Breeze"  Tonight is the induction banquet for Thespians.  That means I have to wear a dress or skirt. Blagh.   It starts at 6.. I guess I should start trying to find something to wear.  ...Soon... Soon....  Ok, on to the topic of the my least-liked person. Corbin. Bah.. Just when I thought he had given up on me... He yells out to me that he wrote a song about me and begins shouting out some lyrics... Bah... I can't stand that boy. You think after being continually rejected since February(?), he'd get the idea...   (Some) boys are so dumb.

       Listening to - Dance Hall Crashers, "Triple Track"  As, promised here as some paintings that I did with  urlLink ArtRage . Keep in mind I did these very, very late at night, and that I am left-handed using a right-handed mouse... :)        A purdy heart.    Some circles.    A leaf in all its leafy goodness.    Two people fighting. Do you see it? ...I'm not even sure that I do... Actually, the more I look at it, the more it looks like an archer.       A pretty flower...       I forgot what I was orginally trying to do with this one, but I screwed it up so I smeared the paint around with the palette knife........       A chick's body... This turned out much better than I thought it would...

       Listening to - Conan  Awesome thunderstorm tonight. It kicked in--can thunderstorms kick in?--while I was on the way home from  To Kill a Mockingbird . ....Awesome...   I love silliness and goofiness. It's great...  Like, yesterday I was in a shitty mood, but not long after I came back to school for  Mockingbird , I was in a great mood... People crack me up.. :) And it only got better from there... And again, today, not in a great mood, but after being around the silliness of the folks there, wow!, good mood!  People are great. Especially, boys... They're goofy :)  I can't wait until 4-H camp... This summer is going to be wonderful!  ...All day it hasn't seemed like a Friday, and it still doesn't... Meh.  One week until exams. Eeep...  But, less than two weeks of school :D  I need sleep... Can you tell? :)

       Listening to -  Whose Line   This is what Amy told me... Ms. May, the lovable lunchlady at school died in a head-on car accident on her way home from school today--the staff had to stay today. The people in the other car were from Jefferson, but Amy didn't know who they were...  This is sad. She was so nice and always smiling and cheery. Man, sad stuff...  It was common for her to give extra food to people as they were going through the lunch line. She'd say, in her slighty-broken English, something like, "You skinny! Have more food!" or, "You a cutie. Here you go!"   I want to know who the people in the other car were... But I guess I'll find out tomorrow at school.

       Listening to - videos a'la VH1  There wasn't power in some parts of the school today so they dismissed us at 9 o'clock. The first day in two weeks that I come to first period we get out early. Awesome stuff, huh?  The cicadas are out and about now. They are not bad yet... But walking into the house I saw an area no bigger than a square foot that had at least 8 shells attached to the grass there, and I nearly stepped on two cicadas. ..These aren't the ones that are normally around here. These ones seem a bit shorter in length and have red eyes, not green ones. Their red eyes creep me out... Nothing with red eyes is ever harmless... Creepy little things they are...

       Listening to - Eddie Izzard  My glasses are really pissing my off. Oh, what I would do for 20/20 vision...   Ok, I had to get that out of the way.   I saw  Van Helsing  today. Wasn't very good.... The plot was good, but that was it. The special effects were bad, the writing was bad, the way it was shot was bad... Pretty much everything was bad...   Dad, Susan, and I went to a stock car race and demolition derby (not at the same time), but, just a little bit after it started, it began to rain heavily...and was cancelled... Bah. Bummer.

       Listening to - Alkaline Trio, "Hell Yes"  Yay! The school bond passed! ...Know what that means? New high school for J County and MAJOR renovations for Jefferson. Sweeet :) G said today that he hardly cares about the seats in the auditorium any more--they're very shitty-- and after  Mockingbird  is over he won't care at all because as soon as school is out they're going to start fixing it... ...Meeeeaning... A FOOKING DECENT AUDITORIUM AND STAGE NEXT YEAR! :D If you have never seen a show at Jefferson, our auditorium and stage are very pathetic... It's kind of sad... But,um, our lighting and sound systems are probably the best of the area high schools... Everyone one at Regionals was really impressed by them...   Oh, and I am doing something for  Mockingbird . I was going to do sound, but G kept pushing the date back that I needed to begin coming to rehearsals, so I said fook it... But now I am a...*drum roll, please*... TICKET PERSON! Whheeee! So, I'm working box office at the in-school shows (Oh, I know Ramsey is going to give me hell for missing class due to that) and I think I might be doing it for the regular evening shows as well...  I think I really bothered (that isn't an accurate word, but oh well) Corbin today (reading  urlLink March  19 and 24 posts and probably some others may help). In 7th period we had class in the auditorium as is common and I put all my stuff by one seat on the end of a row around some friends then when to the potty and when I came back Corbin was sitting in the seat next to one that I put my stuff by, so I if I wanted to sit by my stuff, my only option was to sit next to him... And, well, I can't stand that boy for several reasons... So, I kinda stood there for a moment and made a face while I pondered what to do... Tim and Kyle, who Corbin was talking to, gave me a weird look, then Corbin basically said, "Jeezus Christ! Just sit down! I'm not going to hurt you... I'm not going to try to change your feelings or anything... Come on, sit down.... I mean, you'll hug some emo guy that hasn't washed in 10 days, but you won't come near me who likes friggen soap!" Ah, Corbin, master of the rational and fitting arguments... :/ Then Dillon asked if I knew my cue to exit for his scene that I'm in for theatre3 and I said my line that I say before I leave (" I'm  going to a fast food place!") and he got excited or whatever because of how I said it or that I actually knew it and he was like "I love you!" and he kissed me.. on the side of the head... It was pretty funny... Then a couple seconds passed and he was like "...Did I just kiss you!?" hehe, Corbin has this complete "wtf" look on his face... man, funnny.... ..Sorry that was pointless wasn't it?  I need sleep.

       Listening to - NOFX, "Don't Call Me White"  Wow, Blogger.com relaunched... It's so different. It feels foreign. There are a lot of new neato features, but I'm not feeling the aesthetic side of it...  They added more templates to chose from--several of which I like-- but I don't think I'm ready to give up my simple black and white one...  They added a built-in commenting system. I turned that one on and left the exsisting one in, so I could see how they compare...   ....Ok, back to what I really wanted to type... I'm hating summer already, and it hasn't ever arrived yet...  It was in the high 80s today... Yeah, I know it's not that bad, but I'm a wimp.. Actually, I probably would have loved it if the friggen school had air-conditioning! Bah... Running and getting all sweating is no fun, but sitting in class for eight hours and sweating and not being able to do anything about it royally sucks! ...Russel (my English teacher) brought in a fan to have in his room.. That helped somewhat...  The county's (4-H) Council Circle is tonight. That should be fun :)   Oh, oh! And no school tomorrow! Thank Jeebus for (primary) Election Day! :D

       Listening to - nothing... headaches are bitches  Happy Cinco de Mayo! :) I was going to write this all in Spanish in honor of the day, but realizing the effort I would have to put into it to make it somewhat grammatically correct and all that good stuff and reminding myself that I haven't used a lick of Spanish--outside of basic conversational phrases and questions and complaints--for over a year that decided it would be better if I just stuck with English. Maybe on El Di'a de los Muertos I'll whip out some Spanish.... Maybe....  ...I don't understand why people outside of Mexico celebrate this day? ...It's sort of like the Germans celebrating our victory at Yorktown. It seems kind of silly to me....  As much as I am glad to have Lucky back, I don't think I am going to continue to wear him daily. After not wearing a watch for over 2 months it just feels weird. Like right now, it's rubbing against the edge of the keyboard and is just bothering me... Plus, it's bright red and blue look so silly.  Ugh, I hate saying that... I don't like something because it is overly silly?... What's becoming of me?       Mrs Eisenhart, my drawing teacher, after my asking to use her "skizzors" : Aw, Isn't she cute?  Andrew : Yes, Ashley Reedy is the cutest of the cute!   Hehe, Goofy stuff makes my day....  Oh, and Happy Birthday to Heidi!

       Listening to - music videos...  My watch has risen from the dead! :D My beloved Lucky Charms watch which I got out of a cereal box is working again. It died at least two months ago while I was washing paint brushes because I had let a little too much water get to it.. I gave it a few days to come around, but it didn't. So, I just put it on my desk and forgot about it. However, I checked on it today out of curiousity and found that not only was it working, the time was only about 10 minutes behind and the date was a day ahead.  Yay! I'm so happy.  And just Sunday I was complaining about having to find a new watch.  Wearing a watch feels really weird though....

       Listening to - nothing :)  The SAT was much easier than I expected. I feel like I aced it, but we'll see what the results say...  Matt was there. Blah. I actually had an odd feeling that he would be.  I first saw him right before I went into the room in which I was assigned to take the test in. I just gave him a really sweet smile, like one that would be used to greet an old friend.  During the break that we had, I was standing the the hallway talking to Autumn and Bekah, and Matt and (I'm assuming) his girlfriend came up and were leaning against the wall about 10 feet in front of me, behind Autumn. Matt was standing so he was facing me. I know he did that on purpose. What an ass! ...It didn't bother me though. I was just hoping that maybe we would be friends again, but that doesn't seem like it is going to happen. ...I just hope he's not like that at any of the 4-H camps. That would really suck. But, if he is, Joanna would probably be on him like his stupid hair is. :)

       Listening to - Blink 182, "Josie"  I went outside and looked at the moon tonight. It's so beautiful. It's a waxing gibbous tonight. Great stuff. Anyway, as you all probably (don't) know: I'm always pondering what the hell I want to do with my life. ...And as I was gazing at the moon, I realized that I think I would love to be an astronomer. I mean, how many other people do I know that can spend hours upon hours looking at the night sky, and, when not outside at night, spend hours looking at pictures of space and reading just about anything related to space.  ...But then again, I also don't personally know anyone who has an appreciation for art such as I have... :/ So, I have narrowed my future professions down to either a photographer/photojournalist or an astronomer.  Wheee!  ..Oh, another advantage to being an astronomer: A lot of work at night. :) Fits me perfectly, no? ..But a disadvantage to my being an astronomer: I hate physics. I mean, it's not bad, but I think Fleming ruined it for me because my widdle brain couldn't handle all those formulas he threw at us at once. Bah. ....I shall overcome! (my dislike of physics).. I mean, you have to admit. Physics is pretty neat.   ...And just for the record, "Josie" is one of my most favorite songs. Yay.  ...Also for the record,  urlLink this site  rocks my socks. (Mind you, plenty of other great sites do as well... Mokey. Mokey.)

       Listening to - Garth Brooks, "Thunder Rolls"  I really wish I had my driver's license. I'm looking through "Where: Washington" magazine. (It's one of those magazines that you find in hotels, and it tells about the "shopping, dining, and entertainment" in and around D.C.) And I'm looking at all the listings for art galleries and art shows and museums and the like...  Ugh, This makes me so depressed.  I wish I had my license or knew someone else who likes to just wander around looking at art and old stuff. Blah.  Blah ....BLAH!...

We had 368 at OMC, and 183(?) just at Tri-County Older.  Sheesh. The Mill is going to be empty.   It still is going to rock.   How How for 4-H friends! :D

       Listening to - Brother Bear   The week was good, but, I don't know, it felt different from past OMCs. It seemed like something was missing... I don't know...  It was a very,  very  interesting week to say the least... (Go get some snacks now, kids; this may be a bit long!)  So, Saturday/Sunday morning, I didn't bother sleeping since we were leaving at 6am. I started getting ready around 5ish. (Waaaay later than I wanted to since I wanted to be at the Extension Office--where we were leaving from--around 5:30.)  I rushed and rushed and got there around 6. Oops... But no worries, since the bus was going to be about 50 minutes late because he was coming from Hancock (which is  more  than 50 minutes away). So, a lot of people went to McD's or a similar place for breakfast instead of just standing around waiting...  Weeeell, the bus was there in 50 minutes. I think many people were kind of surprised, but just figured that the bus driver must have been past Hancock when he called or something like that...  We loaded into the bus, someone put on  Mulan  and everyone settled in for a long, uneventful bus ride.  Right. Since I didn't get sleep, I fell asleep pretty quickly. Everyone who was awake noticed that the bus was shaking more than it should and it seemed to be tipping around the turns--we had to go through the mountains and even on the interstate the road is still very hilly and curvy. But, everyone just assumed it was their imaginations.  ...Until we got pulled over by a cop. A big, completely loaded (both with people and cargo) carter bus was doing  98 MPH  in a 65 MPH zone.  I didn't know buses could even go that fast. The speedometer stopped at 80, so the needle on it just stopped there...  Crazy shit.   Well, we got to camp. It was great as usual. The  urlLink "Outspoken for 4-H"  bikers rode in to camp along with Representative Capito. Bah, I can't stand that woman.  Also in camp on Sunday night was the first Prince of  urlLink Mali . Pretty cool, huh? I mean, it's  Mali ... But, still royalty... Until he was introduced later in the evening at Council Circle, I just thought he was a new staff member, and it took me a while to notice his accent...   Annnd, I met  urlLink Jesus . The real deal. ...Except he goes by the name of Brad now...   So, moving onto Monday... What interesting happened? Hm...  Oh, at OMC we take a class or two (either two hour-long classes, or a one two-hour long class). I took a two-hour class of Art. Wheee! Fun. I did a somewhat abstract painting of a woman's form with paint splattered all over it and an oddly colored print of hills and evergreen trees. I didn't put details or anything, but I know my mom didn't like it. Heh..  Also, there was a guy in that class, John, who is friggen awesome at charcoal drawings. He did his first charcoal drawing ever during that class. Wow, great stuff. And he did another one of the All Star Rose Garden, and put them both in the silent auction on Thursday night. And I got the second drawing. Yay :)  Tuesday... Hm...  Oh! After class, John and I were walking around, and he said that he was going to audition to MC (emcee?) the Informal Banquet which was on Thursday night. Since, I had nothing else to do I decided to audition also...  Well, we both (along with 5 other people) got call-backs after dinner. There was a position for a guy and girl to MC and positions for the opening a closing thought.  ...Anyway, I got Closing Thought which meant that I got to read a poem in front of 400 people... Wheeee!  Wednesday.... We had a bunch of different health activities in the morning that we could participate in, but could only do three... I choose the do Dance Dance Revolution, and found that I completely suck at it! :) Then I did, Clogging. Oh man, Friggen awesome. I wasn't too good at it, but, man, it was fun! I'd really like to do it more... My last activity was yoga, which I have always loved, and I really need to get some videos so I can do it at home. Mmm, yoga is awesome...  Thursday... Nothing major.... Until word got to Tiffany that her mom, Cindy, had a stroke. :( She of course, went home as soon as she heard. (Since she rode the bus up, Chad drove her home.) This was the first day in nearly a year that I prayed.   ....I read the  urlLink poem  for Closing Thoughts. I have never been more nervous in my life! I've read in church in front of 350 people, but for some reason that was not nearly as bad as reading at OMC... I got a lot of compliments of my reading and the dress that I wore--which was Jessica's because I left in such a rush on Sunday that I forgot the outfit that I wanted to wear...  During the banquet we (the Jefferson county people) found out that Cindy was conscious and that the stroke wasn't nearly as bad as was first thought... Thank God. That was the best news I heard in a long time.  Also, Amy, Scott's (Cindy's son and Tiffany's brother) wife, was induced for labor that day...  Friday... First half of the day was pretty good. John asnd I were about to go and do a charcoal drawing of some thing around the Mill. We were standing around trying to think of the best place to draw went I saw Storme walking towards me crying. So, I go up to her and hug her, trying to figure out what's going on... She tells me that Cindy died that morning.  Ouch. I'm in shock. I've known Cindy for as long as I could remember. She was always so kind. So, so nice and kind. And, oh my God. Mitch, Ryan, Marsha, and Tiffany! God, I feel so sorry for them. And Scott and Amy! Wow. They didn't tell Amy until after she had the baby... Actually, I don't know how long they waited to tell her...  But, shit. It was so sudden, so unexpected.  ....Council Circle was good. Josh Potter--what a cutie! (*sigh* If only I was 13...)--got the Outstanding First-year Camper Award and Sarah Potter got, I think, the Outstanding Female Camper Award. How! How! to the Potters! :)  Saturday... Good day... As good as the last day of a camp can be.. I wasn't  anywhere  in the camp slide show. Argh :\ (Neither was James, so I don't feel  so  bad..) Emma B., Morgan, Patrick, and Sarah Johnson all got chosen to be out of state delagates. How-friggen-How!  Oh, speaking of out-of-state delagates Jonathan from North Carolina... Wow, gorgeous... ;)  And I didn't see John (not to be confused with Jonathan), so I didn't get to say "bye" or get his screen name. :/ And I didn't get Ross's or James's screen names either... *snap*...   Random quotes:  me: "I don't get it..." Ross: "Poking is another term for sex." me: "Oh, I knew that.." Ross: "Ashley, I'm so glad that I can be blunt with you!. . ."    Amy: ". . .But you did say me, right?" me: "No, I said you."     me: "Do you have a pen?" Amy: "No, but I have a needle; you could carve it into your wrist."    Jonathan: "Wait, I'm on the bottom, and you're on top, right?" ...Uh, he was referring to how our arms are supposed to go when dancing....   And seeing that it is Sunday now...   HAPPY 20th BIRTHDAY JONATHAN!

       Listening to -  SNL   Ok, a little more about camp.  Patrick does the funniest impression of a cicada. He did it in our (the Delawares) funny stunt for Friday night's council circle. ..Wow... Ever laugh so hard that you can't breathe? Yeah, that was one of those times...   oh, and  GOOD LUCK  to everyone going to Nebraska (for the International Thespian Festival)! :D

       Listening to - Rise Against, "Like the Angel"  I lost my glasses...  I fell asleep on the couch while--I think--wearing my glasses. When I woke up I wasn't wearing them, and I have been wandering around the house for a while and haven't been able to find them anywhere. :/  My feet are back to normal size now. Yay! hehe  Ok, so more about camp... For the Charter's council circle they did a "never been done" which was having a cop come in and "arrest" Jimmy Russel (a counselor) and hand cuff him to a tree.  Oh my god. So funny! Later Ryan Frankenberry (another counselor) was handcuffed beside Russel... tehehe... So great!  I  finally  learned some line dances! Yay! That makes me so happy...  I'm still pretty bad at them, but I might consider going to Dance Weekend next year.... Maybe...  I have to be at the Extension Office at 5:30 tomorrow morning to get on the bus. Yay! I'm so excited! :)  I just wish Matt was going to some state camps.. He was even chosen to be an out-of-state delgate to another state's 4-H camp, and he's not going to that. Bah.  Stop it Ash...

Bah I have one on my calf that is swollen also..  All my other big bites are fine...   Bah.  ...Just though you'd like to know that. :)

       Listening to - CNN (I'm catching up on the happenings in the "real world")  I have  85  new emails on my MSN account... I would feel loved but few are from friends or any one that really matters... :/  WOOOOAH! Just read this email from the Big O (Jeff O.) about OMC:  . . .The enrollment for OMC is currently 397 which includes the staff, but the overall camp attendance is 360+. . . .We still need about 44 more campers to fill the Mill completely. . . .  Wheeeee! That's INSANE!  400 people ....   400 PEOPLE   HOW-HOW TO THAT!  Tri-County camp was grrrrrrreat! Abso-fucking-lutely GRRRRRRRREAT! I can honestly say that I love 4-H more that anything else... Wow, so fun... So, so fun... I don't think that have laughed so much in my life... :D  My voice is a bit, um, rough after this week.. This is the first time since Intermediate camp (I went to Older this year) that I have even come close to losing my voice, and that was about 5 years ago...   ...Matt, of course, was at camp.  I made that sound like a bad thing. It wasn't. Not even close.  We talked some, but nearly everything we said to each other was goofy/stupid/funny or some combination (which was hardly different from when we were together).  Anyway, this just made me realize how much I miss him... I don't want to date him again, just be good friends because, as Morgan, Joanna, and I were talking about, he's the only person I know whose goofiness not only compares to but may possibly exceed my own. And that is fooking awesome in my book... I guess what I'm saying is that I just miss having conversations that lasted hours about the goofiest, stupidest stuff... When I told that to Jo she recalled a time that I was spending the night at her house and I was talking to Matt on the phone and she overheard us talking about Tetris for very long time... hehe.. I don't remember that, but I'm sure it was a very stupid conversation. :D  Oh! Oh! And I'm not white anymore. I have a tan! Wheeee! I don't look sickly when standing around most other people. Yaaaay! And!, I found someone with legs whiter than my own!... :) (Go Sarah!) :p

       Listening to - nothing  I hate packing. Well, no. I don't actually hate it.  I just prefer to do nothing.  ...I still haven't started packing yet. Ugh.  I don't think that I ever will actually resize those pictures, so, uh, until they move off of the front page, you're going to have to live with the template being screwed up.  Oh, and hi Earl. :)

       Listening to -  Simpsons   I just tried a new toothpaste today... Yeah, no big deal, right? Wrong!  It was Crest's Whitening Expressions in "Fresh Citrus Breeze".. Mmmmm, soo goood!  It tastes like citrus (duh) and cloves... Man, it's delicious....  Tomorrow I'm off to 4-H camp for two weeks... YAY! :)

       Listening to -  Vh1 ILLustrated   I'm drinking Schweppes Ginger Ale... Ugh..  I miss my Canada Dry...  This stuff is terrible compared to it!  I -- finally! -- got my learner's permit again...  I must say that the picture of me on it looks great...  I know that sounds conceited, but I think it's one of the best pictures ever taken of me.. (That seems kinda sad...)  I have a quartet of terrible canker sores.. Ugh..   That's all... You can go about your business now...

       Listening to - nothing  I vomited for the first time in several years, and, wow, did it feel good.  Scott had been sick all day, and it spread to me by the afternoon...  All afternoon and evening I had the feeling I like was going to vomit. I took a nap. Woke up around 12:30 and vomited like there was no tomorrow--ok, it wasn't that bad, but you get the idea... I'm just glad that I had soup for lunch.   Sorry, for the lack of updates. I'll try to do better, I promise!...  And I will get around to resizing those drawings sometime so that my template isn't all screwy...

       Listening to - nothing  So, Scott called a few minutes ago from Cumberland. We both thought that was about two hours away from here... So, in two hours... I'm going to see my brother for the first time in at least a year and a half...  I'm excited, for now...  I finally got new contacts tonight... They're the extended wear kind.. ..They are a lot stiffer than my old ones, but my eyes are getting used to them very well. Actually, aside from being able to see, I can't tell that I am wearing them. :D  Tomorrow is the last day of school. We go for 2 exams and leave...  ...It doesn't seem like the last day yet.. Well, at least to me...       [Amy and Harold are talking about their feet or something..]   me : (pointing at their feet) Ahahahah! You guys have feet! Hahahah!  [Geoff gives me a weird/dumb look.]   Geoff : HAHA! You have feet!...  me : Hey! I just said that, and you gave me a weird look!  [Geoff gives me a dumb look.]   Geoff : Haha! Feet! Feetsies! You guys are feetsies!  Man, I'm going to miss having lunch at school with all the loons that I sit with...  I really hope that all of us have lunch together next year..  Today I had my US 2 History Exam, and I could not remember Mikhail Gorbachev's name (I completely blanked on it :/ ), so instead I drew a (stick-figure) picture of him emphasizing his red birthmark.. Hopefully, Ramsey will see the humor in it and give me partial credit... Highly unlikey, but, hey!, I can dream, right?...
