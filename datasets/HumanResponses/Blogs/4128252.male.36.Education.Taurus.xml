						   My wife and I returned from the Official Star Trek Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada on Monday. I am still not sure exactly how I ended up getting to go, but I am really glad I did. We almost always take a grand vacation during the summer and as we were discussing what to do this year, I jokingly told her that the convention was just before school started up again and that is where we could go. She got up and said "let's book it". I laughed, but we sat down at this keyboard and secured our hotel, flight and convention tickets that very night.  My wife is extremely cool and understanding about the hidden geek that rages within me. I have to act "grown up" at work and take charge of most situations, so she indulges me when I loose myself in my inner sci-fi fanboy. I always joke and tell her if I would just gain another seventy five pounds and grow a bad goatee, she would be married to the comic book guy from The Simpsons. She is a wonderful woman, but she is not what you would call a diehard science fiction fan, so I felt like spending her vacation like this was a big sacrifice and I promised myself I would cater to her as much as I could while we were in Vegas.  So my lovely redhead and I traveled to sin city to hang out with other trek fans from around the world. Now, I am not the dyed in the wool, name that episode, have that prop or wear that costume kind of a fan. I am just the guy who likes the franchise and has followed it...ummmmmm...a little more than your average television viewer. I can remember episodes, but not the name of the prop guy who colored the styrofoam space rock that Kirk hit the lizard guy with on that planet--oh alright-- it was a Gorn he hit with the styrofoam rock. See, more information than some, not as much as others. I am the guy who walks around the convention looking at the people in costume and saying to my wife "see, I am not as bad as that guy", but inside I am thinking "I would look pretty damn cool in that uniform". My inner trek guy was having a lot of fun.  It was a great experience. I got to see a few of the famous people like Nimoy and Shatner and I got to see many of the not so famous people. I got to shake hands with Wil Wheaton, which was a highlight since I had just finished reading his second book. I am more of a "don't read the book, wait for the movie" kind of guy so I hardly ever read anything cover to cover. It was a great experience meeting my "favorite author" in and of itself.  Now, I know I said my wife isn't a huge science fiction fan, but she does have a secret soft spot for Battlestar Galactica. During the convention, she got to meet Herb Jefferson, Jr., the guy who played Boomer on Battlestar Galactica and even got him to call her little brother. The story behind this revolves around her brother being very sick when he was young and everytime they went to the doctor, he got to stop at the toystore and get something new. He invariably chose something from the Galactica universe. So my wife got THE Lt. Boomer to call her brother and talk to him. It was really great and they talked for almost ten minutes before he closed the cell phone and signed a picture for her brother. I am sure this was the highlight of the trip for her, but my taking her to all the shops on the strip telling her to "go crazy" probably wasn't a bad memory either. That woman can flat out shop!  One of the things I noticed that truly impacted me was the number of handicapable people that attended. Several who had obvious physical or mental challenges, some minor and some very severe, but all had found a place within that Star Trek Universe just the same. Seeing those fans enjoying themselves, laughing and dressing up in starfleet uniforms made any problems I might have brought with me seem very miniscule and petty. I am not sure what everyone else carried away from that convention, but I felt humbled by these outstanding individuals who helped me see outside myself and remind me that life is to short to worry, stress or feel sorry for yourself. Life is also to short to drink cheap beer, but I learned that somewhere else.  Throughout the convention, I could see a gleam in my wife's eye that told me she knew she had done a good thing by bringing me. I was able to forget about work and the pressures that accompany it and just lose myself in the fantasy. I walked around the exhibit hall saying "this is so freakin' cool" for the first two hours that we were there. I held her hand and showed her props and pictures that brought back a flood of memories from my childhood and even my college days. I pointed out people signing autographs and told her who they were and what their part of the show was. I took pictures of stars as well as pictures of her with a Borg, and Ferengi and a giant Klingon. I am not sure if she thought it was as cool as I did, but she humored me and smiled big for the camera. We rode the rides within the Star Trek Experience, drank the space drinks at Quark's bar and she even went so far as to discuss who we could "dress up as" the next time we attended at convention. I love my wife for many reasons, but today, I love her for letting me be a kid!

						   I have toyed with the idea of creating an online journal for a while now. Of course, I want to be somewhat creative, instead of just laying down all the complaints and whining that I seem to accumulate throughout my day. So, time will tell exactly what this blog will evolve into.  I read a cool quote in Wil Wheaton's new book "Just a Geek", part of which was "scream without raising your voice" from a song by U2 (hence the title of my page). Things have happened lately that have given me cause to reflect on that thought.  You have to understand, I am a big guy. I mean, like 6'2, 235lbs big. I have a deep voice and it...ummm...carries quiet well. Anyway, I can say just about anything and people think I am "raising my voice" or "yelling".  I am also a High School Principal in a small Texas school. Now, I doubt that anyone has really warm, fuzzy memories of their school principal. Usually, we are the bad guys, the discipline givers and privilege takers away. Couple that fact with my stature and demeanor, and I sometimes get a label of "abrupt and heavy handed". Now, I have a great rapport with most all the students and teachers. They all know I have an open door policy and they can, and do, drop in any time. Moral is up, scores are good, discipline works and we are progressing in a very rapid fashion to being one of the top schools in the area.  However, apparently, a teacher that left ANOTHER FREAKING CAMPUS this summer had some "issues" with me that, for the life of me, I can't connect her to me or to my campus at all. Anyway, she whined to the right people within the community, who whined to the right school board members in the community, who talked to the Superintendent, who, in turn called me in to tell me that everything was bad. I need to be hold teachers accountable, without hurting their feelings. I need to have discipline on campus, but I need to "overlook" certain things and certain students. So, all the work I have done over the last several years and, especially over the last year, was completely invalidated.  Now, here is something people may not have figured out about me. I love what I do, I mean, I truly love it. I have never had another job that was so fun, fulfilling and motivating. I have a job where I get to take risks, I get to lead and I get to make a difference. I love it so much that I am willing to put up with the endless paperwork, the irrational and irritated parents and the apathetic teacher and/or student. I can even handle all the neverending criticism from people who should either try the job for a day or shut the hell up. Unless you know the job, you have no idea how to do the job.  Now, not only am I fighting a battle to maintain positive public relations with the community, but now I get to put on a horse and pony show for the "Powers That Be", all of which have no idea what my job means or how tricky it is to establish a balance of stucture vs. comfort. Ah well, it will just be another challenge and another opportunity to "grow as a person and as a professional". This year I will "cry without weeping, talk without speaking and scream without raising my voice". See, now wasn't that positive??  O.K., so apparently I am going to whine a little within these hallowed halls. Sorry about that. I'll be a happier-go-luckier-blog-poster-er in days to come.
