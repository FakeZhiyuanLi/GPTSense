       The following preamble introduces the discussion entitled "Voting for Life." The contributions to the discussion are archived from April 18 downward to April 1, so that they can be read chronologically by scrolling from top to bottom. Each contribution is marked with its original date of composition.  One of the drawbacks of the argumentative blogging world is perhaps the risk of closing oneself within an echo chamber of free-wheeling consensus that is punctured only on occasion by the sharp tone of a stray troll. Being new to blogging, I cannot generalize beyond the description of this "risk," but I wonder if the sustained, civil exchange of differences in opinion is a rare thing for bloggers to blog.   In a series of occasional posts to follow, I would like to present a (for the most part, civil) exchange between me and a long-time acquaintance, both of whom, for different reasons, are disaffected Democrats. Whereas I bemoan the increasing influence of corporate money on the Democratic party and on the campaign process generally, my acquaintance, Robert, is a devout Catholic who supports the Democrats on most issues but finds himself voting against them consistently because of their support for abortion/reproductive rights.   The exchange, which took place before the systematic torture and abuse of human rights by the U.S. military at the behest or complicit indifference of its highest commanders was brought to wide-scale public attention through the publication of photos from the Abu Ghraib prison, concerns pressing questions of the quality of popular media in the United States, the War in Iraq, abortion, life, John Kerry's platform, George Bush's record in office, and justice.   In presenting this exchange, I hope others will join in by way of the comments box, or "constructive thoughts box" as I labeled it. I will identify the different posts that come from the exchange with the common title "Voting for life" and number the posts to distinguish them from posts dealing with other topics.

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written from March 27 to March 30.]#1  Fanni says : The other day, I took the trouble to write you a short note and included a few articles relating to a  urlLink study of public attitudes .  Did you receive it? If so, I would like to know your opinion of the topic.   I have read the 23-page study and found it to be enlightening. [Jim Naureckas has  urlLink described the study  as follows: "The survey, by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes, found that misconceptions about the Iraq war were closely related to what news outlets an individual relied on for information. And for each misperception studied by the research group, viewers of Fox News were the most likely to be misinformed."] Of course, no one would be as foolish as to claim that this study proves that Fox and CBS, for instance, are the  cause  of public misinformation in the US, or of the exceptionally high incidence of support in the US for what the rest of the world largely views as an unjust and terrorism-propagating war. For, it could be the case that viewers inclined to seek solace in pro-war info-entertainment and pro-military-industrial-complex politics simply find that their views are confirmed by these corporate-state outlets.  Bill O'Reilly certainly finds solace in the war machine he supports. As Jim Naureckas  urlLink reported ,  "In an October 4 interview with CNBC's Tim Russert, Fox News star Bill O'Reilly made a puzzling boast about his network's Iraq coverage. He said, 'Well, I think Fox News Channel was lucky because we were less skeptical of the war, and the war went very well. So we won.'"   How about you? Clearly the Pope was resolutely against the war in Iraq and even admonished Mr. Bush Jr. face-to-face before Bush gave the commands for the outbreak of violence. How do you harmonize your respect for life with the fact that tens of thousands of civilians in Iraq have been killed by our government on the basis of hyped-up, false, misleading charges and, at best, demonizing, fascist politics that pretend that, for instance, France and Germany and the UN were actually arguing FOR the regime of Saddam Hussein (which is the worst abuse of argumentation in international politics that I have heard since the days when Hussein's own disinformation campaign was still in full swing)?   I'm just curious where you are on this issue. As well as on the issue of our corporate-state media, call it liberal or conservative, fair, balanced or what-have-you.   If it is true that you support life, then, I wonder, have you given any thought to the fact that 10.5 million children under the age of 5 died from easily preventable diseases last year, and that the institution—the World Health Organization—that has the potential to prevent these diseases has been severely under-funded by the Bush administration? Does this sort of fact mean nothing to you? Or does it concern you? Or does abortion appear like the only life-and-death issue that is worth any trouble to you? And if so, why is this so? Do you generally resist seeing your emphasis on life in its broadest context and focus exclusively on the destiny of fetuses? If so, why?   Of course, Bush has done some fine posturing with respect to the issue of AIDS. However, even here, his record concerning human life is horrific. In addition to the undeniable impression that Bush is more concerned with securing drug company profits than providing cheap drugs for sufferers of AIDS the world over, consider that President Bush promised $3 billion per year over five years for the AIDS initiative while the White House's 2004 budget request ended up asking Congress for only $1.9 billion annually. But even that sum was a mirage, as it was partly based on a reshuffling of related accounts. For example, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, much of which is designated for Africa, received a $150 million cut from the previous year. Moreover, Congress mandated that even this money will not be spent unless the Europeans match the U.S. contribution. Immediate consequence: countless infant deaths that could have been prevented.   I expect you to respond by quoting the number of abortions worldwide and reminding me of how terrible they are. But I would only ask, would you ever be willing to take into consideration all the ways this "culture of life" president's policies lead to infant deaths worldwide? Or is that simply impossible for you to do? If so, why? And if you had convincing evidence that the president's policies were leading to more infant deaths than there are abortions in a given year, would you consider voting for someone who would seriously support preventive measures for infant health worldwide and generic drugs, even if that person did not seem socially conservative on the issue of abortion?  If not, why not? Why is the fetus more important than the walking and talking infant? Or isn't it, to your mind? Is there no difference?   Thanks for sharing your thoughts.    Robert says : I want to respond briefly to some of your questions. Whether we went to war on "hyped-up, false, misleading charges" is still really unknown. Those are the charges of Bush's political adversaries, but not yet proven.  As to the war with Iraq, I personally was ambivalent about doing it, primarily since it was the first time we had done a "preemptive strike."  Of course, I am not for killing innocent civilians, but there are such things as just wars, which the Pope felt Iraq was not. I believe one could argue that point, however, but the true facts to do that are still not totally known. (Hindsight is 20/20, and Iraq apparently did not have weapons of mass destruction which threatened us in an immediate way.)  The world is a complex place and one side is hardly ever 100% right and the other 100% wrong. Neither the French nor the Germans were completely free of ulterior motives in opposing the war, as I recall from various news stories. The French, I believe, had a large oil deal with Saddam that would be interrupted if another regime took over.   Regarding Bush's policies, I am not a Republican.  I am a pro-life Democrat who votes for pro-life candidates.  Many thing Bush and the Republicans do upset me, but without life, no one has any rights.  If the Republicans cut funds for foreign aid, I can (and do) give to charitable organizations that serve children and adults overseas.  If the Republicans cut educational benefits at home, I can (and do) give to support education at home.  But if pro-choice Democrats vow to continue the 31 year war against the unborn at home (as Kerry has done), currently with 3600 daily fatalities, and vow to extend it overseas through supporting abortion-promoting population control agencies (as Kerry has said he will do), and to continue the war on the unborn into the far future by appointing pro-abortion justices to the Supreme Court (as Kerry has vowed to do), I cannot bring anyone back to life, so I will vote for anti-abortion Bush.  We were all unborn human beings at one time. The unborn are real and they are here now. Their killing is direct and immediate.  I cannot support someone who believes that the direct, immediate killing of innocent human beings, for any or no reason, should be a legal right.

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written from April 7 to April 8.]#2  Fanni:  I will interject a few remarks.    Robert:  "Whether we went to war on "hyped-up, false, misleading charges" is still really unknown. Those are the charges of Bush's political adversaries, but not yet proven." 	   Fanni:  It is not still "really" unknown. If you would like me to forward you a long list of hyped-up, false,  urlLink misleading charges  relating to immanent threats, possession of weapons, etc., I will. You are not likely to have heard them aired on  Fox News , which is broadcast in the TVs that hang in the White House. In fact, if you use  Fox News  as your primary source of news, for the sake of being able to conduct an informed discussion with you about the current administration, I suggest you that balance this "fair and balanced" news source with other, non-corporate, non-militaristic voices. Many of these misleading charges were part of the President's various State of the Union addresses. I am sure you took them in, in the moment of their delivery, before their false nature had been fully revealed. Others have been repeated recently by members of the administration. There is no "gray area" here behind which you can hide in an attempt to uphold as justified our belligerent president's motivations.  Fox News  will tell you otherwise; but, personally, I get my news from many different sources, and avoid war-cheerleading of the sort O'Reilly gives us, dressed up as "debate." I suggest you do the same. The death by U.S. fire power and cluster bombs of tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Iraq on the basis of false charges is not a venture that holds out the promise--not even a distant one--of respectability or justification.  Your "Oh, well the Germans and the French were not pure" line of argumentation, which I have seen  Fox News  return to time and again as a way to divert attention from the real debate, holds no merit whatsoever. The fact is, the French and the Germans were not resisting any and all calls to confront Hussein's criminal and enfeebled regime. You may have forgotten that, since the administration and  Fox News  have long forgotten it in their last-ditch effort to make it appear that anyone who disagreed with them actually wanted Saddam Hussein in power or supported him for self-interested reasons. The fact is, the Germans and French were calling for 3 and a half months more of inspections before a decision about conflict be made. Yours is a preposterous claim, furthermore, given the unchecked quest for wealth and profit that our war in Iraq has unleashed almost to the exclusive benefit of large U.S. corporations. Cheney's corporation, the one that still pays him in excess of 100,000 a year, has made a killing the likes of no corporate-war machine has done in the history of the world, and it has done so after having seriously curtailed over the last three years its lobbying of Washington. (Why lobby so ruthlessly, when your top guy is the vice president?)   Robert:  "As to the war with Iraq, I personally was ambivalent about doing it, primarily since it was the first time we had done a 'preemptive strike.'"    Fanni:  I am pleased to hear that your conscience is still showing signs of life on an issue other than that of abortion. Ambivalence is a good first step towards a reasonable view of the Bush administration. You should also be suspicious of the flagrantly absurd evocation of "preemption" as a means of describing military aggression in contexts where no serious threat to national security was substantiated.  	  Robert:  "Of course, I am not for killing innocent civilians, but there are such things as just wars, which the Pope felt Iraq was not. I believe one could argue that point, however, but the true facts to do that are still not totally known.  (Hindsight is 20/20, and Iraq apparently did not have weapons of mass destruction which threatened us in an immediate way.)"  	  Fanni:  Voices the world over recognized this war as unjust from the get-go. Even members of Congress recognized that there was no clear evidence of an imminent threat. So, no one is arguing with the disingenuous "hindsight" logic that you refer to here. The only citizens of the world who supported it outside the U.S., as a majority voice, were those of Israel, and they obviously had their own motives for seeking aggression against their neighbors.  It is not my view that this war should have been opposed simply on the grounds that "war is unjust." That is a simplistic view of warfare that totally disregards the reasons for which a ridiculously powerful and oil-consuming nation like the U.S. goes to war with paper tigers of the sort that Iraq was one year and a half ago. To counter the logic of war that fueled this vicious, terrorism-propagating international outrage, one has only to do what so many people outside (and even inside) the US did: criticize it for its real motivations, which are at bottom corporate, and focused on the oil-rich region that is Iraq.   Robert:  "The world is a complex place and one side is hardly ever 100% right and the other 100% wrong. Neither the French nor the Germans were completely free of ulterior motives in opposing the war, as I recall from various news stories."  	  Fanni:  Various? Try reaching outside of your nationalistic corporate news, and you will get a broader understanding of the issue.    Robert:  "The French, I believe, had a large oil deal with Saddam that would be interrupted if another regime took over."   Fanni:  What about the large oil deal the US hoped to make by going to war (the plans for which, we now know, were sitting on Cheney's desk one week into his serving as vice president)? Is that not worth considering? The war profits hoped for by U.S. corporations with the dogged assistance of the current administration far diminish anything the French and Germans could have hoped for by forestalling the war for a few months.   Robert:  "Regarding Bush's policies, I am not a Republican.  I am a pro-life Democrat who votes for pro-life candidates.  Many thing Bush and the Republicans do upset me, but without life, no one has any rights."    Fanni:  This is the point I would most like to comment on. I think that, as long as Bush remains anti-abortion, you will find myriad ways to excuse his failings, his aggressions, his fascism, etc. So, it's not really worth our discussing at length whether, say, his last war was justified or not. For you, Bush can always be justified to some degree by the fact that he is anti-abortion. And you have reasons for thinking that this one justification is necessarily primary with respect to other, possibly lacking justifications.   Let me therefore shift the topic from the war in Iraq. I want to ask you about this "primary justification" or "ultimate right." It seems to me that it is the most important principle for you and has been so for all the years in which you have fought abortion. I have often wondered, since I have known you to support Bush, and since I have followed the devastation that Bush has brought to and promised for our environment over the past three years (including, at last count, 370 roll backs of environmental regulations, many long in place), just how bad an anti-abortion politician would have to be before you could no longer give the politician your support. Have you yourself ever posed this question, if only hypothetically? Because if, as you say, without life, there are no rights, then one could imagine a leader whose policies did truly horrendous, holocaust-like damage to humanity, but who would no less have your support, as long as the leader fought for all fetuses to be born and thereby fought to assure the basis of other rights, however damaged or neglected or violated all those rights were as a consequence of their leadership. One could even imagine a leader who called for the "letting die" of millions of children every year, as well as the increased poisoning of air and water by corporations that leads to measurable increases in asthma, for example, and who, instead of supporting measures for developing renewable sources of energy, siphoned off the national treasury in an annual multi-billion dollar corporate welfare program designed to fatten American fossil fuel barons. But you already do that in supporting Bush. So, while still respecting your principle of "this one right trumps all others," one could go a step further and imagine that George Bush called for the execution by fire power of all children who reach the age of 5 and do not commit themselves to killing for and drilling oil for their livelihood. A preposterous example, for sure. But what would you do in such a case? I assume you would withdraw your support for Bush. But if so, then there must be some sort of cut off, some sort of point at which your "inviolable principle" no longer trumps all others, right?  If so, I wonder, where is that point? 	  Personally, I think you and I are both on the same side of this large issue of life, and the respect for it which we are called to cultivate. However, claiming that this one principle is primary with respect to all other issues of life is, I think, remarkably short-sighted. We live in an age in which thousands of species disappear from the planet every year. We live in a time where humanity has demonstrated irrefutably that its use of fossil fuels is rapidly leading to conditions that will try our race's ability to remain alive on the planet we inhabit. Therefore, claiming that the destiny of the fetus is the primary issue of life-and-death for humanity simply is not true. I don't mean by that that it is not important, and that it does not involve life-and-death issues in the same way that other issues do, but its primacy is no longer a thing assured, by dogma or scientific means. The disappearance of the human race means the disappearance of the ability of the human race to produce fetuses. Obviously.   Robert:  "If the Republicans cut funds for foreign aid, I can (and do) give to charitable organizations that serve children and adults overseas.  If the Republicans cut educational benefits at home, I can (and do) give to support education at home."   Fanni:  Good luck in trying to counteract with your donations all the violence and degradation to the world environment, political and natural, that the Republican Party is bringing about. Remember, the Republican Party, while it may ring a few of your bells on certain conservative social issues, has as its main purpose of being extracting cheap labor out of the citizens of the world and maximizing profits for the few (which profiteers are disgracefully called "entrepreneurs" in the jargon of Carl Rove). If you haven't realized this yet, I would be stunned, and only chalk your blindness up to the passion of your anti-abortion struggles.   Robert:  "But if pro-choice Democrats vow to continue the 31 year war against the unborn at home (as Kerry has done), currently with 3600 daily fatalities, and vow to extend it overseas through supporting abortion-promoting population control agencies (as Kerry has said he will do), and to continue the war on the unborn into the far future by appointing pro-abortion justices to the Supreme Court (as Kerry has vowed to do), I cannot bring anyone back to life, so I will vote for anti-abortion Bush."   Fanni:  I will not flush at your war rhetoric. Rather, I will assume it wholly and remind you that there are many, many wars being fought everyday. And the war on the fetus is devastating, for sure, but it is not primary when you consider the destiny of the human race. All "pro-lifers," I would think, would have necessarily to be environmentalists of the highest order. This fact will only become increasingly true as, in the next century, nations go to war not only over the few remaining sources of oil, but over access to clean water and clean air.   Robert:  "We were all unborn human beings at one time. The unborn are real and they are here now. Their killing is direct and immediate.  I cannot support someone who believes that the direct, immediate killing of innocent human beings, for any or no reason, should be a legal right. Peace."    Fanni:  I don't dispute the recourse to categories of "directness" and "immediacy." I am not one of a liberal camp that tries to diminish the significance of the violence wrought on the unborn. My view, rather, is that the violence done to all of us for the sake of short-sighted corporate greed, and most importantly to the bio-diversity and environment that we must treat as sacred -- whether we believe in a God or not -- is just as direct and immediate, and in fact concerns not only all of us as "one-time fetuses," but the destiny of all humanity, living and to come. No administration has done more violence to our environment than the Bush administration, and so I would wonder at point you might draw a line, or at least weigh the balances, in your support of this administration, or any administration that so violently pursues corporate profits and fossil fuels to the great peril of humankind. Peace, indeed.

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written on April 4.]#3  Fanni writes:  A little follow-up to your assertion that it is principally a charge of the pro-abortion camp -- you said: "the president's adversaries" -- that the justifications used to perpetuate war in Iraq were misleading and false. You can keep deluding yourself into confounding the hasty aggression in Iraq with stakes in the fight against abortion, but eventually the truth will out (and it already has, long ago, to all those who do not suffer from the sluggishness that results from uncritical over-exposure to  Fox News ).   Charges based on reports known by the administration to be fraudulent (as was the charge made in the State of the Union about substances obtained from Niger for making nuclear weapons), outdated and irrelevant reports (as was the material plagiarized from a student's essay in California), and discredited or disreputable and lying defectors from Iraq do not require pro-abortion adversaries to the president to be exposed to the public. Neither do contradictory statements and outright lies, of which this administration has offered up many (see  urlLink Representative Waxman's report  whose link I sent you for a generous sampling thereof).    I do not know what it's like to be a single-issue constituency such as yourself, but it must be a painful task to have to deny the validity of all these emerging facts simply not to feel that you may have lost a little ground on your One Issue. It's too bad, too, that your anti-abortion candidate for the presidency has pulled off one of the most grotesque attempts at justifying a war of aggression since Hitler sent Germans, disguised as Polish thugs, to kill German sentinels in Gdansk as a way of provoking fear and anger among the Germans at the Poles, just days before September 1, 1939. It must be painful, too, when you consider that experts on terrorism are asserting today that this war of aggression in Iraq has promoted, not combated, terrorism abroad. In a time of international terrorism that demands intelligent, investigative solutions and international cooperation of the highest degree, we are saddled with "I'm-a-war-president" Bush, and it's sad to think that this thug and all his incompetent conspirators, who have siphoned off the national treasury to the wealthiest of the land and compromised international peace and security on the basis of "the best intelligence" (which is to say, rubbish), are the best you can do in finding an anti-abortion proponent to fight your one big fight.   But I try to empathize with your plight. I know that it stems in large part from the fact that we have a winner-takes-all political system in the United States that penalizes people for not herding their votes together into two separate camps. As long as Kerry remains a "baby killer" intent on conducting, as you say, a "war on the unborn" and as long as Bush talks about something called "the culture of life," Bush can do just about anything in the world and he will still pocket your vote. This unconscionable bind you find yourself in is in fact understandable. In America, we have gotten used to voting for the less bad candidate. That is how our political system works. Moreover, it practically assures that our candidates will continue to get worse and worse in the future, since the party-appointed candidates know that all they have to do, to remain electable nationally and win it all, is appear one notch less undesirable than their one major adversary.  But I wonder if it truly excuses the posture of single-issue voters such as you.   If you would still like to try to answer the questions I raised in my first e-mail on these topics. I still have no idea if there exists a point at which you would withdraw support for an anti-abortion candidate, however bad that politician is.  And I am beginning, in fact, to doubt it. I am beginning to think that, if you had to choose between, on the one hand, a candidate who promised to lop the head off of 10 innocent five-year olds, or let 10 innocent five-year olds die from an easily preventable disease and, on the other, a candidate who would allow 10 fetuses to be torn rudely from their mothers in accordance with the mothers' wishes, you would without hesitation choose the former candidate, because something other than LIFE is at stake for you in your fight against abortion. But I am not sure. And I am not sure, either, what this "something other" that is bigger than life itself is for you that allows you to prioritize the destiny of fetuses in such a way. In short, my main question remains unanswered. So far, you have shown yourself to be good at parroting the  Fox News  view of the world (Bush, righteous; French and Germans, bad; Saddam, evil, imminent threat (mushroom cloud, tortured and gassed his own people, etc.); all those not with us are against us, etc.) and at demonizing John Kerry (who is someone I had not even mentioned). You haven't, however, answered my questions, as you said you have.   I know you're someone who has enjoyed consuming and disseminating images of war, both on the born and unborn, and so I thought you would appreciate these  urlLink photos from Iraq . They probably did not make it to your  Fox News  TV screen in between images of Mr. Bush wearing a soldier's jacket, serving up Thanksgiving dinner to soldiers, or crawling out of a fighter plane. (It's always very quaint, isn't it, when a civilian dresses up in soldier's clothing? We certainly had never seen a president do it before.)    And I politely request that you not maintain, in the face of all evidence, that your vote for an anti-abortion, pro-death penalty, pro-war president can have only one meaning (i.e., "abortion is wrong"), and be free of violent consequences.  	 While weighing in your mind the righteousness and virtues of Mr. Bush, you might also find this report, coming from a Republican, to be worth taking into account:    urlLink Worse Than Watergate: Former Nixon Counsel John Dean Says Bush Should Be Impeached   Finally, it's a sad temptation I can't resist: sharing today's news from Bush's "mission accomplished" in Iraq. I'm sorry I don't have photos of the scores of innocent victims, torn to shreds by US firepower as they prayed in a mosque. Perhaps the photos will be made available in the foreign press. If so, and if I can locate them, I will be sure to pass them on. I am sure that there are enough images of murdered innocents in Iraq to counterbalance all the gruesome photos of aborted fetuses you show others. We can perhaps swap our favorite pics. And if Bush is reelected, we will have years of image sharing ahead of us, I'm sure.  It's nice that I can share this information with you, though, in this way, 'cause I am sure that, on  Fox , if this report of yet another abuse of power and outrage to human rights on the part of the U.S. occupiers gets through at all, it will be wrapped up in deceitful rhetoric from our commander-in-chief, who will falsely claim that the Iraqis resisting foreign occupation hate freedom and liberty, and who will falsely confound this nationwide resistance to U.S. occupation with his supposed "war on terror." Lost in Bush's rhetoric, as I'm sure you can generously appreciate, is that the U.S. occupation of Iraq is very obviously fomenting resistance and violence across Iraq and the Middle East.   If you have begun to look for news outside the comforting and self-deceiving little world of support for American international vandalism and hooliganism called  Fox News , maybe I don't need to keep sending you these updates? Just let me know.      U.S. Hits Fallujah Mosque; 40 Said Killed By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer  	FALLUJAH, Iraq - U.S. Marines in a fierce battle for this Sunni Muslim stronghold fired rockets that hit a mosque filled with people Wednesday, and witnesses said as many as 40 people were killed. 	The fighting in Fallujah and neighboring Ramadi, where commanders confirmed 12 Marines were killed late Tuesday, was part of an intensified and spreading uprising involving both Sunni and Shiites stretching from Kirkuk in the north to near Basra in the south.  	An Associated Press reporter in Fallujah saw cars ferrying the bodies from the mosque, which witnesses said had been hit by three missiles .  Robert writes:  The innocent civilians in that mosque were firing on U.S. troops.  In studying the abortion question, I have learned to be wary of unsubstantiated statistics. Some groups just seem to make them up as they go along. For example, you stated, "Calling the death by US firepower and cluster bombs of tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Iraq ..." To the best of my knowledge, cluster bombs were not used in cities in the 2nd Iraq war.  Smart bombs were.  "Tens of thousands" is a gross exaggeration.  If you can document otherwise, let me know.         A second possible example: You stated earlier that something like 10.5 million children died because Bush would not send them needed aid. Without documentation, this again sounds like a figure that someone pulled out of the air.  Although even one child's death is a tragedy, Bush's "complicity" in these deaths is indirect and remote. He was not responsible for the circumstances or actions which caused their illnesses, and other wealthy nations share in the responsibility to help them out.

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written on April 7.]#4  Fanni writes:  thanks for the substantive replies. I will address them when I get time to. The statistical points are minor, but I will address them to your satisfaction, I hope.  	 I look forward to your addressing the principle I was questioning you about. Till this point, I have no reason to believe that, were Hitler in power today and had he declared himself anti-abortion, he would not have your full support. If that is not so, I would like to know on what basis that would not be so. That's the sort of thing I'm wondering about: whether it is possible for you to take a critical view of an anti-abortion politician or issue or whether, on the contrary, according to the principle you announced in a recent e-mail, the "right to life" trumps all other rights and therefore cannot be viewed in a larger context of things such as corporate-driven warfare, fascist politics, the corporate-driven devastation of the environment, preventable diseases running wild due to corporate indifference, etc. At what point can you weigh the balances for and, most importantly, against a declared anti-abortion politician? Or can't you? Do you feel you have found the one issue in respect to which you can assure yourself a righteous vote in every case? Do you feel it is possible for there to be such an issue? Is abortion that one issue? Are there others that would do equally well for the same ends? Or does the issue of abortion stand alone in that respect?   In your message, you wrote: "The innocent civilians in that mosque were firing on U.S. troops." 	  Where did you find this summary explanation for the deaths in the mosque? I couldn't find it anywhere. In any case, it seems a little suspicious to cast the U.S. troops as victims in the midst of their offensive, cleansing action designed to root out what the administration thinks or tries to make us think are isolated, radical, insurgents. It also reminds me of the Gdansk anecdote I brought up yesterday. How many times have tyrants succeeded in convincing the masses that they were in fact the victims, the innocent ones? It's a very old strategy that we should be more critical of. The question with respect to this anecdote is not: Who shot first? It is: What is the U.S. doing in Iraq? Should the forces be there? Should they be confronting entire communities with violence? Bombing civilians?   If you think that I or some group is grossly exaggerating, consider that I did find this report on yesterday's activity in Iraq at www.democracynow.org:	 	  "Over 150 Iraqis have been killed including 26 in Falluja where US warplanes bombed a residential Sunni area.  16 children and eight women were killed in that attack ."  And I invite you to show this assertion to be false.   Disputes over sources aside, are you willing to assert that the US forces have not killed many innocent civilians recently and over the past year? That would be a tall order. It would be a weak way out to seek justification for this violence by saying, well, a few innocents will die inevitably. There was nothing inevitable about our manner of assaulting Iraq. There was no imminent threat; many, including the Germans and the French, made that assessment before our first bombs were dropped; and if you still believe there was an imminent threat, a "mushroom cloud" in the offing, you are living in a state of willful blindness and sucking up to the worst sort of propaganda ever invented by US leadership (because it has almost all been proven false, and was used to further what is arguably the most counter-productive aggression every undertaken by US forces anywhere).   	  Robert:  "In studying the abortion question, I have learned to be wary of unsubstantiated statistics."    Fanni writes:  I will substantiate the numbers I used in previous e-mails (I have to go back and check the sources again). But, first, I want to ask: what is the point of this part of your message? Do you think that, if you manage to discredit certain numbers of dead that I have cited, you will have defeated the merits of my view of what is going on in Iraq, and by the same stroke justify your support for Bush's war? I highly doubt the strategy, if that is indeed the one you intend to employ here. The REASON I doubt it is because you have yet to make clear the basis on which an accurate death toll would be meaningful to you. If the actual toll were known conclusively to be 20-30,000 (the most liberal estimate I have found), and not 2,000 (the most conservative I have seen at any point in the conflict), would that change your view of the war to any degree? What if it were known conclusively -- a hypothetical, for sure, but please grant me it -- that 600,000 innocent civilians had been killed, would that cause your ambivalence to the war to grow, and would it cause you to consider withdrawing your support for Bush? If not, why not? If numbers matter to you (and I can't see yet why they would, given your previous arguments), is there a limit -- say, a rough number of innocent deaths caused by U.S. forces -- beyond which you would find that a vote for Bush would ring more loudly as a vote for violence than as a vote against it? This is the most important question I keep returning to.    Robert:  "Some groups just seem to make them up as they go along.  For example, you stated, ‘Calling the death by US firepower and cluster bombs of tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Iraq ...'"    Fanni writes:  I will quote the source later. You can decide what the "group" is in this case, determine whether they are pro- or anti-abortion, and make your decision as to the figure's merit on those bases, if you like. But my point remains. Where is the limit to the amount of violence (military, ecological, etc.) you are willing to support, to keep the violence of abortion from being perpetuated? Have you ever conceived of one?   Robert:  "To the best of my knowledge, cluster bombs were not used in cities in the 2nd Iraq war."      Fanni writes:  You are wrong. Your knowledge on this point is fictional. Did it come from  Fox News ? I will find several sources that provide evidence that cluster bombs were used. It was a big point of dispute before the hostilities broke out, and Rumsfeld in particular refused not to use them. On this point, as on others, I would ask whether you get your information from  Fox News  principally. The point is relevant because there are good reasons for finding this state-friendly news engine to be suspect. I sent you a link to a recent report to that effect and you didn't say anything about it.   Robert:  "Smart bombs were."     Fanni writes:  That's a cute expression. "Smart bombs." Do you think it matters to a young boy whose skull has been knocked off whether it was removed by a smart bomb or a cluster bomb? I invite you to take the euphemistic jargon of the military less seriously. War is not a "smart" or "surgical" process. It is violent and imprecise by nature. No amount of dressing up by  Fox News  or the Pentagon will ever change this basic fact. Enemies are not more easily identified by improved technology, because non-hostile entities swiftly become hostile in changing conditions. And there can be much more to be said on this, but I simply reject your facile reception of this jargon. I am even disgusted by it. As a student of warfare, you should have learned to be more critical of bogus language designed to make war sound neat and economical from the point of view of more powerful forces and with the intent of sparing its supporters any pangs of conscience.     Robert:  "'Tens of thousands' is a gross exaggeration.  If you can document otherwise, let me know."    Fanni writes:  I will let you know. In the meantime, since you don't yourself have conclusive evidence (which may not exist, likely for strategic reasons that benefit current U.S. foreign policy), it might be hasty of you, at the very least, to declare that "tens of thousands" is a gross exaggeration. More to the point, it is irrelevant to our discussion if tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis have actually died because it would have no effect whatsoever on your assessment of the present administration and its foreign policy in particular. That is, unless you say otherwise.    Robert:  "A second possible example: You stated earlier that something like 10.5 million children died because Bush would not send them needed aid. Without documentation, this again sounds like a figure that someone pulled out of the air."    Fanni writes:  I will track down the source. But, again, even if it were pulled out of the air, it doesn't yet matter to our discussion, because you haven't yet said that, in the case where such a number of children had been left to die as a direct consequence of neglect by U.S. and other powers (I take your point there, that other nations are responsible, too), it would effect in any way your estimation of Bush. The contrary seems to be the case. What would you care if 10.5, or 600 million were known to have died in such a way? You could rationalize that number of deaths easily. By blaming the Germans and French, for instance, or making subtle distinctions between direct and indirect causes of death, or between "killing" and "letting die," and by, on the basis of these subtleties, washing your hands of all responsibility in your support of Bush.

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written on April 7.]#5  Fanni writes:  Hello, again. In reply to your assertion that cluster bombs were not used in Iraq, I went to  USA Today , a source that can hardly be called "left wing" (by perhaps anybody other than Rush Limbaugh, for whom everyone else but himself and a few like-minded fascists are "liberals"-- where that means something to be reviled -- but I am not sure about Rush's "take" on the insipid  USA Today , and that's not the point here). There, I found  urlLink conclusive evidence  that not only were cluster bombs used, but that many were used. Moreover, their strategic pertinence to the war had been seriously put to question before the war was commenced, and their inhumane consequences warned against.   In the face of this evidence (which was hardly hidden from public view), the point is this: why do you keep holding out a juvenile image of the present administration's supposedly righteous ways in Iraq? How much evidence do you need to tilt your ambivalence so that it becomes actual skepticism?  You say, "there were no cluster bombs." On what basis do you say this? Out of optimistic hope that your anti-abortion hero in the executive office is not a thug? And a member of an administration full of thugs? For how long can you hold out this hope? And for what stakes other than those relating to abortion?  Here a few decisive statements taken from the  USA Today  report:    "The world's most modern military, one determined to minimize civilian casualties, went to war with stockpiles of weapons known to endanger civilians and its own soldiers. The weapons claimed victims in the initial explosions and continued to kill afterward, as Iraqis and U.S. forces accidentally detonated bomblets lying around like small land mines."   "A four-month examination by USA TODAY of how cluster bombs were used in the Iraq war found dozens of deaths that were unintended but predictable. Although U.S. forces sought to limit what they call "collateral damage" in the Iraq campaign, they defied international criticism and used nearly 10,800 cluster weapons; their British allies used almost 2,200."  13,000 cluster bombs, including those of our British allies, is a far cry from none. You would agree, wouldn't you? You would agree that the 10,800 cluster bombs used by Rumsfeld's forces are a lot more than zero, and not very "smart," in any sense of this word, wouldn't you?  You might go to bed tonight dreaming of "smart bombs," righteous U.S. leadership in Iraq, and defeated isolated, radical, liberty-hating terrorists, and still hoping and praying that the international hooliganism of Bush can be portrayed in a pretty light so that no one in the U.S. can gain any ground in the fight to maintain or further practices of abortion, but I have done what I can to give you reason to increase your ambivalence with respect to U.S. aggression in Iraq in particular and to stop living in a  Fox  World of "smart bombs" and a "war on terror," and an "Operation Iraqi Freedom," etc.   I will address the other, statistics-based claims when I have time later.  p.s. To be precise, you made a distinction between the city and country use of cluster bombs (as if only civilians lived in cities and only soldiers lived and worked outside them! How "smart" that sounds! And, oh, if war were only that clean and tidy, then we could just remove evil from the face of the earth, couldn't we?). Even more pertinent to your false impression that cluster bombs were not used in cities, then, is the first sentence from the article to which I sent you a link already:    	 "BAGHDAD ・The little canisters dropped onto the city, white ribbons trailing behind. They clattered into streets, landed in lemon trees, rattled around on roofs, settled onto lawns."  	And this, from further on in the article:  	 "U.S. forces fired hundreds of cluster weapons into urban areas. These strikes, from late March to early April, killed dozens and possibly hundreds of Iraqi civilians. Forty civilians were killed in one neighborhood in Hillah, 60 miles south of Baghdad, say residents and Saad Khazal al-Faluji, a surgeon at Hillah General Hospital who tracked casualties." 	"The attacks also left behind thousands of unexploded bomblets, known as duds, that continued to kill and injure Iraqi civilians weeks after the fighting stopped."   I include this p.s. because I don't want you to think that I misunderstood the nature of your flatly false impression. Your "knowledge" on this point was about as accurate as the "best intelligence" that served to rationalize the administration's war-making in Iraq. But you should have known better, because even a widely distributed newspaper like  USA Today  had presented an investigative report on cluster bombs. The question thus rears its head once more: where are you (not) getting your information from? And why?

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written on April 8.]#6  Fanni:  to follow up on the first of three points on which you tried to discredit certain statements in my previous messages, below I provide further substantiation of my claims concerning cluster bombs (in addition to the  USA Today  report already sent). Substantiation of the other two claims will follow.   Evidence that the U.S. used cluster bombs in civilian areas in Iraq.    I promised multiple sources to substantiate the claim that the U.S. used cluster bombs in civilian areas in Iraq. There are numerous such reports available online. I have chosen two, plus a curious article from  Fox News , released this time last year. I tried to find a  Fox News  "take" on cluster bombs, but could locate only this one article in which the idea that the U.S. had used such bombs in a way that would harm civilians is indirectly – and craftily – discredited, and in which the author states that, "The U.S. military has denied targeting civilians and said it takes  extraordinary measures to avoid hurting noncombatants  [my underscoring]." One wonders how  extraordinary a measure  it would have been for the U.S. Army not to use outdated, proven-to-be-harmful cluster bombs in Iraqi neighborhoods. Apparently, that would have been too extraordinary a measure for Donald Rumsfeld and George Bush Jr.   The first part of the  Fox News  article (copied as #3 below) tries to gain points for the "coalition forces" by dismissing some patently outrageous claims by a source of the criminal regime of Saddam Hussein that is idiotically identified with the metonymic term "Iraq." The second part craftily dodges the credible (and, today, wholly substantiated) accusation concerning the use of cluster bombs by: i) placing it in the above, propagandized context; ii) making uncritical use of militaristic mumbo-jumbo ("precision-guided weapons"); iii) presuming that civilian casualties only ever occur as a direct consequence of Iraqi aggressions or tactics; and iv) quoting U.S. military commanders who hedge as to what weapons were used, and where, and by whom. 	  So, then, here the two more sources that substantiate the reckless use of cluster bombs by U.S. forces in particular, plus a typical piece of propagandistic blather from  Fox News . This sort of comparison allows me to appreciate how it is that you come away from your television set believing that the good ol' boys who fought fascism in Europe and Asia in the 40s are still up to their good deeds today, and swallowing whole the propagandistic images of "Bush, the righteous defender of the American people from imminent threats abroad," and "Bush, the good-faith liberator and democracy-fostering fighter for human rights" (or perhaps you swallow these images only nearly whole, since, with hindsight concerning the false nature of the main war rationalizations and understanding that the war was deemed "pre-emptive" in nature, you have admitted to "ambivalence"). This ambivalence should grow, I think, once you see that not only is the war aggressive in nature (which is arguably unlike anything the U.S. undertook at any time in the First or Second World Wars, despite atrocities and other abuses of international law perpetuated then), and based on false claims – a fact that you have partly admitted to when you spoke of hindsight being 20/20 – and that it is also being waged inhumanely, in a way that cannot be justified by the contextual needs of military strategy. This is why I take a moment to help dispel your false impressions concerning the "smart" use of what are very dumb cluster bombs.   I have put links to all three sources so that you can see where I got these things from and read the full citations and related stories/reports. For the time being, here is a sampling of the articles:   1)  urlLink  Off Target   report from Human Rights Watch  The Conduct of the War and Civilian Casualties in Iraq   Hundreds of civilian deaths in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq could have been prevented by abandoning two misguided military tactics. The use of cluster munitions in populated areas caused more civilian casualties than any other factor in the coalition´s conduct of major military operations in March and April. U.S. and British forces used almost 13,000 cluster munitions, containing nearly 2 million submunitions, that killed or wounded more than 1,000 civilians. International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, does not outlaw all civilian casualties in wartime. But armed forces are obliged to take all feasible precautions for avoiding civilian losses, and to refrain from attacks that are indiscriminate or where the expected civilian harm exceeds the military gain. The term "casualty" refers to both dead and wounded. This 147-page report also examines violations of international humanitarian law by Iraqi forces, including use of human shields, abuse of the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems, use of antipersonnel landmines, and placement of military objects in mosques and hospitals. The Iraqi military's practice of wearing civilian clothes also eroded the distinction between combatants and civilians.  2) Published on Thursday, April 3, 2003 by  The Asia Times  (Hong Kong)   urlLink Cluster Bombs Liberate Iraqi Children   by Pepe Escobar   According to the Arab cameramen, two trucks full of bodies - mostly children, and women in flowered dresses - were parked outside the Hilla hospital. Dr Nazem el-Adali, trained in Scotland, said almost all the dead and wounded were victims of cluster bombs dropped in the Hilla region and in the neighboring village of Mazarak. Abbas initially said that there were 33 dead and 310 wounded. Then the ICRC went on site with a team of four, and they said that there were "dozens of dead and 450 wounded". Contacted by satphone on Thursday, Huguenin-Benjamin confirmed there were at least 460 wounded, being treated in an ill-equipped 280-bed hospital.  3)  Fox News    urlLink  Iraq Accuses U.S. of Targeting Civilians     BAGHDAD — Iraq's health minister Thursday said 36 Iraqi civilians were killed and 215 wounded in coalition air strikes on Baghdad a day earlier, and he accused the United States and Britain of deliberately targeting civilians to break the Iraqi people's will.  "They are targeting the human beings in Iraq to decrease their morale," Omeed Medhat Mubarak said. "They are not discriminating, differentiating." The U.S. military has denied targeting civilians and said it takes extraordinary measures to avoid hurting noncombatants. Fourteen people were reported killed in a northern Baghdad neighborhood on Wednesday in a blast that Iraqi officials blamed on cruise missiles. "So you see, the American and British mercenaries are targeting civilians regardless of their age," Mubarak said. "They targeted shops and small public-sector installations." Mubarak said the total number of civilian dead and injured since the U.S.-led war on Iraq began a week ago is more than 4,000, including 350 dead. He accused U.S. and British forces of dropping cluster bombs on civilian targets. "In Najaf, they destroyed a medical center," he said. "They bombed an ambulance and killed its driver." The U.S. military has acknowledged using precision-guided weapons to target Iraqi missiles and launchers "placed within a civilian residential area." But Maj. Gen. Stanley McChrystal said he could not say whether the missiles that hit the neighborhood were Iraqi weapons or misguided U.S. missiles.

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written on April 8.]#7   Fanni: Today I present the substantiation of my claim concerning the number Iraqis killed by U.S. forces, which I claimed was "tens of thousands," and which claim you called a "gross exaggeration."   Number of Iraqis killed in "Operation Iraqi Freedom"  [compiled on April 8, 2004 before I had assured myself of the legitimacy of a report by  urlLink MEDACT  that in November, 2003 estimated the number of Iraqi dead to exceed twenty thousand, and before a number of major offensives were undertaken by U.S. forces].  1) This is the most comprehensive and rigorous treatment of the question that I have found; a site that avoids inflating numbers and tries to err on the side of underestimating the number of killings. urlLink This estimation  is line with that given by the White House, at www.whitehouse.gov:   The study concludes the following:    On March 20, 2003, US troops invaded Iraq. At least 17,094 people have been killed since then.  2) From Amnesty International.  urlLink  Killings of civilians      More than 10,000 Iraqi civilians are thought to have been killed since 20 March 2003 as a direct result of the military intervention in Iraq, either during the war or in violent incidents during the subsequent occupation. The number is an estimate -no one in authority in Iraq is willing or able to catalogue the killings. "We don't have the capacity to track all civilian casualties", admitted US Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt in February 2004. A different attitude has been shown towards non-Iraqi civilians and soldiers who have been killed.  A year after the war began, Iraqi civilians are still being killed every day. The worst incidents receive some international coverage, but many killings simply go unreported. Often, the assailants are unknown. On 4 March 2004 an AFP journalist witnessed three Iraqi civilians being killed when a missile hit their car and exploded near a US military base in southwest Baghdad. Neither the journalist nor the Iraqi police could find out who fired the rocket, and the names of the victims were not published.  Killings by Coalition Forces  	Scores of civilians have been killed apparently as a result of excessive use of force by US troops or have been shot dead in disputed circumstances. For example, US soldiers have shot and killed scores of Iraqi demonstrators in several incidents, including seven in Mosul on 15 April 2003, at least 15 in Falluja on 29 April and at least two outside the Republican Palace in Baghdad on 18 June. [ See the full report for many other incidents of this kind .] 3) A recent report by medical charity MEDACT estimates that the total number of Iraqis killed as a direct result of the war is between 22,000 and 55,000 people. The report, entitled "Continuing Collateral Damage: the health and environmental costs of war on Iraq," also highlighted the long term health effects of the war, including a health crisis that is disproportionately affecting the young, women, and the poor.  4) Here is an estimation partly based on the Amnesty International report, and partly on the report by MEDACT.   urlLink A Year Later  by John Pilger ; March 23, 2004  Sydney Hyde Park 20 March 2004: Let us be clear on the facts of what happened one year ago today. The United States, aided by Britain and Australia, attacked a sovereign country, unprovoked, and in breach of the most basic principles of international law. By the most conservative estimates, up to 55,000 people were killed, including at least, 10,000 civilians: men, woman and children, a figure confirmed this week by Amnesty International. More than 1,000 children are killed or injured in Iraq every month by exploding cluster bombs, left by the Americans and the British. According to the Uranium Medical Research Centre, the main cities of Iraq are poisoned with radiation from uranium-tipped shells and missiles, fired by the Americans and the British.   As for the World of  Fox News , I was unable to find anything. This is not one of the hot topics there, as you can readily imagine. But perhaps you have the  Fox  line on this one, too? What have they said? I would be interested to read "the  Fox News  report on Iraqi civilian deaths." On what basis did you form your own assessment? Since you are convinced that I have committed a "gross exaggeration," I would like to know if you feel the above studies must all be condemned out-of-hand as well. Does the government's own conservative estimate of 17,000 killed correspond to the expression I used, namely, "tens of thousands"? Not rigorously, I have to admit that much. But is it a "gross exaggeration"? I wouldn't call it that. And I would ask on what basis you have called it that. What motivates you to dismiss any claim that doesn't agree with your preconceptions about what is happening in Iraq, even in cases where you clearly have not bothered to inform yourself? Does the fight against abortion push you to this attitude? If so, is that a bad thing, do you think? Is it necessary?  In any case, with a general upheaval now afoot in Iraq against the American occupiers, the American forces turning Iraq into the American Palestine, and the human toll rising quickly, even the most conservative efforts will soon confirm the unexaggerated and wholly accurate nature of the claim. Certainly by the time you vote for Bush, tens of thousands will have perished in Iraq, and a majority of them will have been innocent of any wrongdoing whatsoever, if the trends till this point remain in place.  But, again, I ask why you have chosen playing this game of trying to discredit statistical claims. Why does it matter? If 4,000,000 Iraqi civilians had been killed by order of a "preemptively" striking anti-abortion president, wouldn't that president still maintain your support? (And what sense can a "preemptive" strike have when there is no threat?) That's the question I have asked you in about ten different ways now and that you have not begun to answer. I mean, does the difference between 17,000 and 20,000 or even 30,000 mean anything to you? Without any apparent benefit to your own pro-Bush assessment of the violence in Iraq, you have tried to push me into a corner concerning the accuracy of this or that statistical claim, insinuated that I have been inaccurate in a fanciful, propagandistic way, and provided no substantiation whatsoever for your own efforts at discrediting what I have written. Of course, I leave it up to you to try to substantiate your efforts at discrediting my numbers.    If I have exposed the false nature of your impressions concerning the U.S. use of cluster bombs, it is because I stated early on my concern that your news sources are too limited and too propagandistic. I not only stated this: I shared reports of a study that suggests that what I think is your principal source of news –  Fox , and other corporate networks – is not to be trusted, at the very least, and certainly calls for being consumed in light of other, non-corporate news sources. You have yet to speak to this issue, though, even to confirm or deny my impression that you use  Fox News  as your principal source of information.   There was one more statement that you tried to discredit in a cavalier fashion (by offering no substantiation of your own). I will turn to that next.

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written on April 9.]#8  Fanni:  Let me quote the third part of your attempt at lumping me together with your pro-abortion foes on the basis of the claim that I, as they do, pull figures out of the air to satisfy ideological purposes, and which I promised I would return to, so as to substantiate my claims: 	  Robert:  "A second possible example: You stated earlier that something like 10.5 million children died because Bush would not send them needed aid. Without documentation, this again sounds like a figure that someone pulled out of the air."    Fanni:  Your strategy here has only been counter-productive for you. It has shown you to be engaged in the unsubstantiated assertion-making that you accused me of and has distracted us from the real issues I have been trying to get you to address. I have countered the first two parts of this tactic of yours and now will address the third. Here is the context in which are found the assertions that you have paraphrased simplistically above:    If it is true that you support life, then, I wonder, have you given any thought to the fact that 10.5 million children under the age of 5 died from easily preventable diseases last year, and that the institution - the World Health Organization - that has the potential to prevent these diseases has been severely under-funded by the Bush Administration? Does this sort of fact mean nothing to you? Or does it concern you? Or does abortion appear like the only life-and-death issue that is worth any trouble to you? And if so, why is this so? Do you generally resist seeing your emphasis on life in its broadest context, and focus exclusively on the destiny of fetuses? If so, why?   Of course, Bush has done some fine posturing with respect to the issue of AIDS. However, even here, his record concerning human life is horrific. In addition to the undeniable impression that Bush is more concerned with securing drug company profits than providing cheap drugs for sufferers of AIDS the world over, consider that President Bush promised $3 billion per year over five years for the AIDS initiative while the White House’s 2004 budget request ended up asking Congress for only $1.9 billion annually. But even that sum was a mirage, as it was partly based on a reshuffling of related accounts. For example, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, much of which is designated for Africa, received a $150 million cut from the previous year. Moreover, Congress mandated that even this money will not be spent unless the Europeans match the U.S. contribution. Immediate consequence: countless infant deaths that could have been prevented. [ urlLink source  of the above information] Before I address the source and substance of the number-related claim, let me note my perplexity at your having neglected the line of questioning to which it leads. The paragraph builds up to the following questions:  Do you generally resist seeing your emphasis on life in its broadest context, and focus exclusively on the destiny of fetuses? If so, why?  Did you feel that you could avoid these questions by discrediting the claim concerning the number of infant deaths cited before it? Or did you only mean to get to the essential questioning later? As I reread my italicized writing above, I think it is clear that, even if the number concerning 10.5 million deaths were a matter of pure ideological fiction concocted by some devilish liberal group in an attempt to demonize President Bush precisely because he is anti-abortion, the line of questioning would still stand and would still call for a reply. The possibility that a false or unsubstantiated number may have been employed in building the line of questioning does not render the questioning itself illegitimate and unworthy of a response. Perhaps, in asking, Does this sort of fact mean nothing to you? Or does it concern you?, I should have foreseen the possible temptation on your part to outmaneuver my line of questioning and so should have diffused this temptation from the get-go by writing, instead, Does this sort of factual claim – however debatable it may appear to you or anyone else – mean nothing to you? Or would it concern you, if you had reason to believe it might be accurate?   As far as I can tell, my line of questioning appears even more pertinent now in light of the fact that you have refused to respond to it other than by substituting for a response a cavalier attempt to try to discredit the factual nature of my figures. But perhaps you just haven't had time yet to respond to the essence of what I have been asking you, or have experienced the loss of a message that would have contained a reply? I suppose that is possible, but it doesn't explain why the quibbling over figures had to be put forth in your initial reply. Or perhaps you have found my main line of questioning to be perplexing and demanding of more effort and attention than did your hasty assertions concerning the supposedly false, ideological nature of certain factual claims that appear in the framing of my line of questioning?   I invite you to explain.     You also noted this, with respect to the same issue:    Robert:  "Although even one child's death is a tragedy, Bush's 'complicity' in these deaths is indirect and remote.  He was not responsible for the circumstances or actions which caused their illnesses, and other wealthy nations share in the responsibility to help them out."    Fanni:  With respect to what you have written here, I find it to be a bad faith argument to assert that, because one who has the capacity to prevent diseases did not cause the diseases, or establish the conditions that initially led to the diseases, that person or institution cannot be held responsible for the failure to prevent the diseases. I argue the contrary. It is the preventable nature of the diseases and deaths that creates the responsibility, and not the fatal diseases themselves. (Certainly, you would agree with me on the issue of abortion that it is the preventable nature of abortions that makes abortion an issue of responsibility. And I doubt that you would say, in good faith, "Well, we don’t have to lift a finger in preventing abortions until the Europeans or other wealthy nations do the same.") Secondly, your point that other wealthy nations share this responsibility is valid, as I said in an earlier message but, as I indicated above, it is lamentable that the Republican-led Congress has exploited this valid point to justify inaction and that the President has done nothing to lead the way in addressing this responsibility. There is at least one candidate for the presidency who has made a large issue of this responsibility and who would certainly give a serious effort at leading the U.S. and other wealthy nations out of their corporate indifference to human suffering and to the preventable loss of human life the world over, but this is not the place to discuss Ralph Nader's platform for the presidency.   The figures relating to deaths in undeveloped nations are hard to establish not only because of the lack of infrastructure and of autonomous, investigative institutions within those nations, but because human lives as they exist outside of wealthy nations simply do not count for anything in the platforms of corporatized governments, just as the civilian lives in Iraq do not count for much in the corporate news engine called  Fox News . (I sometimes try to imagine all those dashingly outfitted, bold, beautiful blonds and well-shaped figures of masculinity that  Fox  employs as its human face and voice, commenting compassionately on the unnecessary killing by U.S. forces of Iraqi civilians, and the scene appears so incongruous as to emit a cruel, hollow laugh from within me, despite all my efforts to master this cynical response.) So, you can always play a game of avoiding questioning and diminishing responsibilities by asserting that someone else's figures are not known to be entirely accurate or by trying to discredit the few institutions that do try to establish such figures by asserting that, on other issues – for you, this means, always, on abortion – that someone else, or that institution, has been on the wrong side. But even if you proceed in this manner, you will not have rendered my line of questioning irrelevant, illegitimate, or unworthy of a response because, precisely, as I have indicated amply before and do so here again, I am also interested in the hypothetical line that says: if you knew this many deaths to be at stake, and that, as President of the United States, Bush is directly or indirectly responsible for those that have occurred and those that are likely to occur, would this knowledge effect your support for Bush? Would it enter into your calculations concerning his merits as a leader in the "culture of life" debates? Or wouldn't it? And if not, why not? Why can't you address this line of questioning?  You do not need any factual report, or any number of credible reports by any number of credible institutions or individuals, to be able to address this line of questioning. And I am left wondering, today, why you have tried, deftly or not, to avoid it.   Lastly, you stated that, "although even one child's death is a tragedy, Bush's 'complicity' in these deaths is indirect and remote." I wonder, do you mean to imply thereby that a pro-abortion candidate such as Kerry is, by contrast, directly and immediately complicit in the deaths of the unborn? If so, on what basis have you made this distinction? Whereas Kerry is (implicitly, but unmistakably) deemed by you to be complicit directly and immediately, Bush is deemed "complicit" (in hedging scare quotes) only indirectly and remotely. As for me, nothing jumps out as being so dissimilar in these two cases. We are talking about politicians who have the power to effect legislation that, in turn, leads to such events as preventable abortions and deaths by preventable diseases. How, then, were you able to distribute your judgments so differently in the two cases? And how were you able to do it without having studied the question of preventable diseases worldwide and the neglect of the issue by both George Bush and the Congress of the United States?   Personally, I don't think the distinction between "direct" and "indirect" responsibility is satisfying. Your invoking it reminds me of Adolf Eichmann's trying to claim that he, and by implication other Nazi bureaucrats, were not guilty of their crimes because they were not directly involved in their application or their ordering. But it is still questionable of you to take my phrasing, which clearly puts Bush in an indirect (but I would still say, decisive) role, and flatten into a wacko assertion that makes Bush look like he is solely responsible for 10.5 million deaths of children with whom he bears a direct relationship – one as direct as the relationship between two correspondents, or acquaintances. I remind you both of (a) my statement and (b) your simplistic, distorting paraphrase thereof:    (a) If it is true that you support life, then, I wonder, have you given any thought to the fact that 10.5 million children under the age of 5 died from easily preventable diseases last year, and that the institution - the World Health Organization - that has the potential to prevent these diseases has been severely under-funded by the Bush Administration?  (b) "You stated earlier that something like 10.5 million children died because Bush would not send them needed aid." This is not a fair manner of proceeding precisely because for you, and for reasons that you haven't explained, the distinction between direct and indirect, or immediate and remote, responsibility is both of prime importance and clearly distinguishable in the cases of, for example, Bush's under-funding the campaigns against malaria and other preventable diseases and Kerry's lack of support for the anti-abortion campaign. The basis on which you make this distinction remains a mystery to me.   Finally, I reach the point concerning the claim of 10.5 million deaths annually. When I present these sources, keep in mind that whether one can link the Bush Administration's policies, directly or indirectly, either to only 10 deaths or to 700 million infant deaths would, strictly speaking, be irrelevant to the substance of our discussion because you have not yet said that, if a figure larger than, say, the most generous estimate of fetuses aborted annually were substantiated – this is a hypothetical – that, in such a case, you would shift your support away from the anti-abortion Bush and to a candidate who has the insight and will-power to address the problem of life loss and human suffering more generally, but who is not anti-abortion.   The only point of my having to substantiate this claim is that it prevents you from obscuring the line of questioning that is central to our dialogue. That avoidance tactic was apparently supposed to make you appear like you are rightfully suspicious of statistics and therefore able to discredit my arguments on that basis alone.   The tactic hasn't worked. It has provided a temporary diversion to our discussion, which obstacle I have, I hope, in this message, conclusively removed.  	 	 Here, finally, are sources for the claim I made concerning preventable infant deaths:  a)  urlLink An article from the Boston Globe , from December 2003, in which are found the following sentences:  	  "In 1970, an estimated 17 million children under 5 died around the world; last year, that number was 10.5 million. In Oman, the success of improving health systems has been striking: in 1970, 242 out of 1,000 children died before age 5, but today its rate is just 15 deaths out of 1,000. But in 14 African countries, child mortality rates are higher than they were in 1990. Of those 10.5 million child deaths, 98 percent were in the developing world. The leading causes of child deaths remain complications at birth, lower respiratory tract infections, diarrheal diseases, and malaria, with malnutrition contributing to all of them.  All such conditions and diseases are easily preventable , the report noted."  b) An  urlLink article  that assesses the World Health Organization report to which I alluded, and in which the following assertions are found, showing only slight variation from the above assessments:    "Some 10.5 million children in poor nations die every year before they turn five, 70 percent from infectious diseases. Leading child killers in 2002 included respiratory infections, which caused 1.9 million deaths. Diarrhea killed 1.6 million and malaria 1.1 million.  "Around 9.5 million of the deaths easily could be prevented, said WHO expert Dr. Robert Beaglehole. 'We can make a difference, right now,' with things like oral rehydration treatment for diarrhea and anti-mosquito bed nets to fight malaria, he said."  You will note, with respect to the second piece, the "immediate and direct" influence that Dr. Beaglehole says can be made in eradicating this suffering and death. This emphasis should impress you since the categories of immediacy and directness are precisely what animate your fight against abortion and because you have tried to diminish these categories with respect to Bush's responsibility in world health issues.   To conclude, you can continue, at this point, to try to cast doubt on my figures, or on the sources which I have used to substantiate them, but that would only expose a willing ideological blindness on your part because, whatever the nature of the facts or precise numbers of these claims (which nonetheless I feel I have convincingly substantiated), you will have refused once again to address my line of questioning and instead opted for nit-picking and resentful, baseless attempts at discrediting the assertions that support that line of questioning.   Thanks for reading. I look forward to your response.

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written on April 9.]#9  Fanni:  While awaiting your reply to my previous questions, I admit that I am still confused about your military version of what happened in the mosque in Fallujah the other day. I was able to find no source that uncritically justified the killing by missile firing in the mosque in the manner you did, by depicting those in the mosque as aggressors who deserved such a death. I found this  urlLink AP article at the Washington Times  that reports there being two radically different viewpoints on the incident:   "In Fallujah, U.S. Marines battled for a second day to seize a mosque that officers say insurgents used as a fire base. Marines called in tanks and warplanes to pound the Sunni gunmen. By nightfall, the American force seized the Abdel-Aziz al-Samarrai mosque for the second night in a row. [....] After a six-hour battle on Wednesday, Marines called in airstrikes before they took the mosque. Sunni rebels moved back in after the Marines left overnight. The Islamic Clerics Committee, whose offices are next to the mosque, said 40 people, including whole families, were killed in Wednesday's bombing. It occurred at about the time worshippers would have gathered for afternoon prayers. The Marines deny any civilians were killed, but U.S. military commanders said a large number of gunmen were killed in the day's battle."  From an  urlLink independent news reporter  in Iraq reporting for "Free Speech News," and www.democracynow.org, I found that the U.S. admitted to only one death in the event, whereas independent observers counted 40 bodies. Moreover, it was written by the Free Speech Radio News reporter that the mosque was filled with worshippers at the time of the missile strikes. Did you not even see such reports, or reports that presented more than a single, military viewpoint? Or did you swiftly presume, as you did with my claims, that any claims that potentially cast the U.S. military forces in a bad light must have been, or must always be, written by groups hostile to anti-abortion Bush who pull figures out of the air? And was it on that basis that you dismissed them?  What matters here is not that we "get to the bottom" of this particular incident. It is highly unlikely that, with our resources, we ever could. Nonetheless, I think it's worth noting the uncritical manner in which you asserted the military version of this incident. It seems odd that you summarily adopt the military's claims in a disputed incident that belongs to a war over which you are supposed to be "ambivalent." You seem to have lost all of your ambivalence and picked up your war drum to beat on it. Why did this happen? And on the basis of what pro-military news source did you form a summary judgment? Was it  Fox News ? I request that you answer this question and, in the future, when you offer military versions only of disputed incidents, please cite your source.

Your point here would have merit if it related only to my very first message about the incident in Fallujua, which message I had already "corrected." I was responding to an initial report that I heard before the full story came out. No mention was made of anyone firing from within the mosque. After I wrote the message (in which I said that I could not find any military version of the incident), I did what any responsible citizen should do: I further checked multiple news sources and got a more complete, if complicated picture. Can you say that you did the same, or that you do so regularly? That's something I have doubted and asked you about and you keep refusing to address my questions on that account. It is significant that I keep seeing the " Fox  view of the world" in your assessment of world events. In any case, I think we can agree, as I said earlier, that this fighting in and around the mosque in Fallujah is a disuputed incident. I adjusted my understanding of this incident without your help and I wasn't being a brainless peacenik. Am I to presume that you have set your war mask down on this one? It seems that you have considered it, but, if so, you may as well say so, as I already corrected my own understanding in a previous e-mail to include the military take on what happened. You're lagging behind on this one even as you try to win a point for belatedly expanding my version of the incident, and then try to force me into a permanent state of hypocrisy, chalked up to "human nature." 	  Robert wrote:  "Second, I could ask you the same question you appear to be asking me.

Does this reference come from a debate had with someone else? I will respond to your question once you have identified the man. I do like the spirit of the question, though. It shows that you -- possibly -- are willing to see abortion in a large context of life-and-death issues. This is certainly not something I have resisted; on the contrary, my questioning has been calling for it repeatedly, and it is specifically this line of questioning that you have most resisted.  	  Robert wrote:  "Third, I believe I have answered your main question.

Fanni writes:  I am not a supporter of Kerry and never was. Sorry, you're wrong on this point, and embarrassingly so, because all I have done till this point is to criticize Kerry. But do I think Kerry would be a better president than Bush? (I don't, like you, shy from a hypothetical). Well, as one commentator said, I would rather vote for a bowl of Jello than George Bush, so, yes. (At least the bowl of Jello would not knowingly tell lies during the State of Union.)  What are the "plusses" you see in Bush, other than his anti-abortion line? Please tell me the main reasons why Bush is a fine president, to your mind, or at least the best candidate among all those running, aside, obviously, from his anti-abortion line.

Hence, I think I answered your question, unless you posed another one I missed."   You missed many questions, including the most important ones, and I will indicate what those are in a coming message.    p.s.  This is what you wrote to me, after I quoted an AP report that did not mention the presence of fighters within the mosque.    "The innocent civilians in that mosque were firing on U.S. troops."  And this is how, today, you characterize this one-sentence, flat, summary rendition of a disputed, complicated incident:    "When I tried to correct your omission by pointing out that US troops were indeed being fired upon, but did not mention innocent civilians, you accused me of beating on the war drum."  It is outrageous to call the above, simplistic and distorting sentence that I have underscored here a "correction of an omission." It is so because, even if it presents new information, it does not say that this information is only to be added, as supplemental material, to other, legitimate information. That is what corrections of omissions do. If you had wanted to present a corrective statement, or add supplemental information that was missing, you could have easily indicated that that was what you meant to do. On the contrary – this is where the sound of your war drum beating punches through – you leaped to the claim (which I have seen substantiated nowhere, in any press whatsoever) that it was the innocent civilians who were doing the firing. Now, it is patently absurd and propagandistic to claim that the innocent civilians were doing the firing; for, in such a case, obviously, they would no longer be innocent civilians, right? So, in ramming together both innocent civilians and militants, you obviously meant to deny that any innocent civilians were in the mosque at all. And I ask, how did you know this to be true? The point has been disputed, and remains so. What you gave me, then, was not a "correction of an omission" but the military line in its full, propagandistic (and, in your version, sardonic) form.   Point denied.

The following was written on April 16.]#12  Robert writes: Hitler was pro-abortion for ethnic groups he did not like and anti-abortion for ethnic groups he did like.   Like any large organization, corporations can do much good and/or much evil. I'll have to check with our reference librarian, but I would guess that a majority of Americans are part of large corporations, i.e., they benefit from profits in the form of dividends, both as individuals and in pension plans their companies have for them, and, as was reported in a column in the Beacon [Akron Beacon Journal] today, in lower prices which benefit all Americans. They help bring economy of size, and are responsible for increased productivity (although certainly not all they produce is good). Large corporations also support many charities such as the United Way. Of course, they can also exploit workers, the environment, and pay their executives ridiculously high salaries and benefits. Hence, they are a mixed good/evil.  Abortion is an unmitigated evil which harms women healthwise, as 31 years of medical research regarding abortion on demand has demonstrated,and well as killing their children.  Of all the issues facing us as a nation, I prioritize, and find abortion to be the most significant, and vote accordingly.   Fanni writes: You finally returned to addressing your single-issue emphasis in politics, and I commend you for doing so. However, what you offer as an argument below is unpersuasive and suggests that you have not thought through a serious justification for it. I will now show you why I think this is so. You write the following	   Robert:  "Like any large organization, corporations can do much good and/or much evil.

Hence, they are a mixed good/evil."  	  Fanni writes:  This is the first half of your argument, in which you establish that corporations are not an unmitigated evil. I agree with the basic premise of the above comments and would only dispute or mark my incomprehension of the claim that "(corporations) bring economy of size," since, as the examples Wal-Mart and many other corporations show, corporations do not bring economy of size; they bring, on the contrary, a quest for the dominance of world markets that is ultimately harmful to market competition (as well as, more immediately, to labor and in many cases environmental standards and to the families whose members are employed there). The only "economy of size" that corporations strive for is in government, which would otherwise be capable of regulating them effectively in the public interest and restraining their tendency to bloat. These off-topic points aside, there is no need to check with your reference librarian concerning the participation of Americans in corporations. I agree that corporations are omnipresent in our lives, and I think that this is true even of those to which we do not belong in some card-carrying way. No American escapes the power of corporations. American society is built upon participation in corporate waste and corporate-driven environmental destruction, most notably in its forcing citizens to rely on individually-operated, polluting vehicles. ( urlLink As others have noted , "If every country had as many automobiles per capita as the U.S., the world would not be habitable." "The pollution would create a nuclear winter-like condition, blocking out the sun.") This omnipresence of corporations does not, however, mean that corporations and their corporate values become superior to civic, national, or family values. A corporation is an artificial entity dependent for its existence on the renewal of a state charter. This renewal system was intended to be regulatory in nature. All states have the right to suspend the charter if they deem that a given corporation is, for instance, involved in crime, damaging public health, or generally degrading the quality of life of the state's citizens, whether the citizens belong to that corporation in some official manner or not. In practice, however, this regulatory power has been reduced to rubber-stamping as states increasingly override civic values on a number of environmental, development, and labor issues in an attempt to attract corporate money and keep it from floating off to other states.   Enough for our discussion of corporations. That is not the topic we have chosen to focus on, and I agree with the spirit of your first premise. I have criticized the influence of corporations on our government and civic life without erecting them into an unmitigated evil and I accept that they have positive features such as employment.   In the message you are replying to here, I mentioned nefarious corporate influences as one possible example of something which you might see as a more significant threat to human life than abortion. That was the main point of bringing up the example of nefarious corporate influences.   Before addressing the second premise of your argument, I note that you avoided my line of questioning that posited corporate influences as one possible example of something more significant threat to human life than abortion and instead focused on the example that was used to concretize the principle of the questioning. Here is that line of questioning, recopied for your convenience. Unlike my generally critical view of corporations, which is far short of unequivocally equating corporations with "evil" and which, as I said, had in this context the value of an example only, the following line of questioning constitutes the main point of my remarks, and has not yet been responded to:     At what point can you weigh the balances for and, most importantly, against a declared anti-abortion politician? Or can't you? Do you feel you have found the one issue in respect of which you have found a way to assure yourself a righteous vote in every case? Do you feel it is possible for there to be such an issue? Is abortion that one issue? Are there others that would do equally well for the same ends? Or does it stand alone in that respect?

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written on April 16.]#13  Fanni:  The second premise of your argument goes to the essence of your way of thinking. It is as follows: 	  Robert:  "Abortion is an unmitigated evil which harms women healthwise, as 31 years of medical research regarding abortion on demand has demonstrated, as well as killing their children."   Fanni:  Using this second premise to conclude that, unlike the mitigated evil of corporations, abortion is an unmitigated evil, begs the question both of what is meant by "the evil of corporations" and of what makes abortion an evil "unmitigated." What does "unmitigated" mean here? The etymology of "mitigated" suggests softening or alleviating, and not, as your argument would suggest, "multi-faceted, more abstract than the act of destroying a fetus" (in accordance, specifically, with your qualification, "Like any large organization..."). The question is, then: how is any other violence or "evil" mitigated, softened, alleviated? Certainly a specific act or form of violence perpetrated by a corporation is not alleviated by the organizational structure of the corporation. The confusion you have raised through your argument stems from assimilating "corporations" and "unmitigated evil done by corporations." These two must remain distinct. Agreeing that there are often wholly pernicious acts perpetrated by corporations would not mean agreeing that the corporations themselves are evil in nature; all I agree to is the assertion that corporations, whose driving principle is profit-making, often commit reprehensible deeds that endanger and cost the lives of innocent people, and in my message I asked if this fact could ever enter into your calculations of how best to respect life. I have never argued that corporations are an unmitigated evil; thus, my agreeing with the premise that "corporations are a mitigated evil (because they often commit unmitigated evil but do positive things as well)" does not mean that I hold that corporations are themselves, in every respect, evil. Nor does it render illegitimate my questions concerning what is meant by the "unmitigated evil" of abortion. Those questions include the following and, if you would kindly address them, they would offer substance to our discussion:    Is abortion always, in every context, and from every possible perspective, unmitigated? If so, why can't other forms of violence be unmitigated, whether committed by corporations or by other means? Or can they? And if they can, how have you established that they, either singly or as the whole, are less important than the unmitigated violence of abortion?   The two things that you have likened to one another in your argument are disproportionate. One could attempt to return some degree of proportionality to the equation by replacing "corporations" with "the destruction of an innocent civilian by U.S. fire power." Or, on the other side, we could replace "abortion" with "health care services" and try to liken health care services in some respect to "corporations." At least, there, the semblance of proportionality would have been respected. You may revile the phrase "health care services" or the institutions that correspond to it and see a slaughterhouse where others see a health care center, but it does not commend your argument in the least for you to find something to praise about the multi-faceted practices of corporations, and then to conclude that, compared to this, the act of destroying a fetus is definitely worse – an unmitigated evil.     I am uncertain what is entailed by this idea of "unmitigated evil," and I grant that there may be something more to it than it appears at present, but even if both premises were acceptable, it does not follow that the institutions that support abortion are an unmitigated evil simply because you state in the second premise that abortion is an unmitigated evil – I point this out even if that is not what you said – just as it does not follow that a corporation is an unmitigated evil if a corporation has been found to poison a child, or push the government into unjust war-making that has cost the lives of thousands. We would agree, wouldn't we, that it is the poisoning, the killing, and the aborting that – if I understand exactly what "unmitigated" means for you – constitute unmitigated evils. Therefore, your task is not to exculpate corporations by offering mitigating depictions of their multiple functions and to use this as a way to argue for supporting the lesser evil (Bush's corporatism). Rather, it is to explain to me how it is that abortion, as an unmitigated evil, enjoys massive attention and priority when compared to other unmitigated evils; or, if you do not allow for the existence of the latter, to explain why abortion is the only truly unmitigated evil.[1]   As I said, it does not follow by implication from your comments that the corporate and political institutions that support the indiscriminate killing of civilians or the intentional destruction of fetuses are themselves unmitigated evils. Certainly you would be able to find something positive to say about the institutions that support abortions and provide health care of multiple kinds, generally speaking, just as you have about corporate practices, generally speaking? You will say, "No, it's not medicine; it's murder!" And I would offer, in the same terms, that "unnecessarily polluting the air I breathe is not a benefit to everyone; it shortens my lifespan and increases asthma in measurable ways among urban youth in particular," or that "destruction by unjustified and reckless U.S. firepower of a two-year old Iraqi girl is not a victory for democracy, it's murder!" In short, we need to put these pseudo-arguments aside if we are going to advance our discussion.   [1] One could easily offer this same  appearance  of an argument on any number of issues and use it against Bush. For example: Ralph Nader fights for a living wage for America's workers and would certainly propose legislation to see it come about, while most Republicans argue that paying workers a living wage will hurt employers' bottom line and thus limit their hiring capabilities; therefore, the idea of a living wage is perhaps a mitigated evil, since allowing people to earn enough to live on for their full-time labor obviously has a positive ring about it, too; on the other hand, it has been rigorously documented that Bush's decision to let irrigators deplete the waters of the Klamath River, in the face of massive protests and warnings from environmentalists and others about the harm this would have on the salmon population, led to the sudden death of more than 35,000 salmon, or nearly 30 percent of the river's salmon population. Now, since this caving-in to business interests to the detriment of the natural environment and God-given life forms is not only an unmitigated evil, from the perspective of each one of those 35,000 fish and in consideration the richness of life that the natural habitat provides all humans (which is a commonwealth not belonging to any commercial interests), but is also typical of the Bush administration, observable in hundreds of other cases, and precisely the sort of corporate-driven destruction of the environment against which Nader has the knowledge and will power to fight, it behooves us to support the candidate who will argue for the mitigated evil of a living wage for full-time working Americans and to remove the fish-killer from office.

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written on April 16.]#14  Fanni:  Our discussion now requires that we know what distinguishes abortion as an unmitigated violence from other forms of violence. Till this point, you have proceeded by assuming it to be so. It is relevant to this assumption that although you did grant at one point that the U.S. has killed thousands of innocent civilians in Iraq this year, you seem essentially compelled to argue in this case, as perhaps in all other cases not relating to abortion, for the mitigated nature of the violence. And thus, to satisfy this requirement in the present case, you pointed out that, "The Amnesty International report also noted that the U.S. paid '1.5 million dollars to Iraqi civilians to claims by victims or relatives of victims for personal injury, death, or damage to property.'" I note here, as elsewhere, that since you appear obliged to make all non-abortion related violence appear mitigated, you are compelled to take information in a selective manner, by excluding that which does not help confirm your guiding principle. Thus, you quoted the above fact while leaving out the statements to which it was leading, and in respect to which the payments by the U.S. are presented as, precisely, an unmitigating factor in the unjust manner in which the U.S. forces are conducting their war and occupation (because the payments do not satisfy the demands of justice, just as no punitive damages would ever be said to satisfy the demands of criminal justice). I will quote the entire section, so that you can see that the quote you gave is not, as you make it appear, a wholesale attempt to mitigate or excuse the violence of the U.S. military but, rather, a strong admonishment of the violent and unjust conditions in which the U.S. military has carried out its take-over and occupation of Iraq:    "In November 2003 the US military said it had paid out US $1.5 million to Iraqi civilians to settle claims by victims or relatives of victims for personal injury, death or damage to property. Some of the 10,402 claims reportedly filed concerned incidents in which US soldiers had shot dead or seriously wounded Iraqi civilians with no apparent cause.   Beyond such payments, however, there has been little recourse for the families of the dead and injured. No US soldier has been prosecuted for illegally killing an Iraqi civilian. Iraqi courts, because of an order issued by the US-led authority in Baghdad in June, are forbidden from hearing cases against US soldiers or any other foreign troops or foreign officials in Iraq. In effect, US soldiers are operating with total impunity."   In the context of the report, it would obvious, I think, to any open-minded reader that Amnesty International is calling, in the words of the report itself, "for all killings of civilians by Coalition Forces to be thoroughly, independently and impartially investigated and for perpetrators of unlawful killings to be brought to justice." Consequently, this report is a call for justice as yet denied and not an attempt to highlight alleviating circumstances that would render reckless warfare on civilians permissible, or relatively permissible when compared to any other form of injustice or violence.   Your assumption that "abortion is an unmitigated evil" in some exclusive or pre-eminent way apparently motivates you not to want to view any of the mitigating factors you identify in other situations or practices of violence with the violence of abortion. Thus, for instance, you did not raise the proportional question in this context of whether you would accept monetary compensation as a way to redress the violence of abortions and accept that, as in your implicit understanding the above case of U.S. military violence, the monetary compensation would render abortion a merely mitigated violence. Let's think this suggestion through: the money could be collected in a government-sponsored fund, which would also have a capacity to receive charitable contributions, which monies could then be used to address violent and life-threatening practices the world over. The 'Commission on the State of Unmitigated Evil in the World' could be its name. This impartial commission of researchers could study at length the question of where the most violence and evil is done to humanity, where the greatest compromises to human health and happiness occur, and where and how expenditures of money could most effectively prevent such violence, illness, and death. In reading through this hypothetical case of monetary compensation as a way to mitigate the violence of abortion, you will likely be moved to reply, "I don't do hypotheticals," but this would only mean that you have avoided the non-hypothetical question I am asking (by means of a hypothetical illustration) concerning your assessment of monetary compensation as a mitigating factor, generally. If such compensation mitigates U.S. military violence, why, in principle, can it not mitigate the violence of abortion? That is the non-hypothetical question I am asking. Moreover, you probably cringe at the mere thought of such a commission as I have sketched it out here because you seem to assume that abortion is the world's pre-eminent form of violence and that it cannot be matched in its evilness, by any quantitative or qualitative comparison, with any other form of violence already witnessed, fully underway, or yet to come – and I am obliged to assume that that is your assumption unless you say otherwise. You would, I presume, scoff at the idea of compensation for abortion victims, and I wonder why you haven't scoffed as well at the thought of an Iraqi family receiving one to two thousand dollars, as some have, for the reckless killing of a family member?[1] You are willing to live with certain forms violence that you do not "support" (other than by voting for those whose actions perpetuate those forms of violence) but you are not likely to be able to envisage living with abortion as an evil mitigated by a compensatory fund. And if that is so, why is that so? I wonder why, in one case, derision rises up within you at the thought of monetary compensation for abortions (as I assume it would), while in the other, you seem to call out, "Mitigated!" at the least sign that the U.S. forces are not punishing the Iraqi people collectively and without regard for human dignity, as it has been reported by www.democracynow.org and by the independent, Fallujah-based Western reporter  urlLink Rahal Mahajan , that their British allies have claimed of them.  In conclusion, I keep returning to the difficulty I have in understanding the nature of these distinctions you make (as in my previous comments about your radically different understandings of political responsibility concerning the respective cases of Kerry on abortion and Bush on civilian deaths and worldwide pollution, which comments you left unheeded).[2] 	  This is the pattern you keep returning to, and that I have identified without finding that it has been thought out or supported in any way. You locate what you presume is the one, unmitigated violence, and militate against all those who might, however indirectly, seem to be complicit in it. At the same time, you identify all those who might be its opponents and, in supporting them fully, exhibit what amounts to permissiveness, rationalizing, or indifference on every other issue. In my view, you even expend energy trying to defend the indefensible and criminal acts of a brazenly-led U.S. Army pumped full of misinformation and macho rage, so as not to appear to lose the slightest step in your impassioned devotion to the anti-abortion cause (simply because that misguided Army is being commanded by a President who speaks as if he has the will to further that cause).   What I find unacceptable is the obligation you exhibit to tell others that the violence done to them is merely mitigated violence, whereas the form of violence you focus on is unmitigated. I find equally unacceptable your inability or unwillingness to account for the exceptional or pre-eminent and perhaps heterogeneous nature of this so-called unmitigated violence, and, instead, to repeat it as in an act of faith, as you did in this way:    Robert:  "Of all the issues facing us as a nation, I prioritize, and find abortion to be the most significant, and vote accordingly."   Fanni:  This is where your dogmatism rings loudest. I have asked you in previous messages and in various ways what makes abortion the most significant life-and-death issue, how it compares to other like issues, and you respond here by saying, in essence, "because it is the most significant." When I inquire as to how you arrive at your prioritization, you reply, "I prioritize." The question for me (that I have posed to you) has never been: what do you put first? The question has been: why do you put abortion first among all forms of suffering and death and injustice in the world?   If abortion were simply or primarily an issue of life, then, after studying the matter for so many years, you would, I assume, be willing and able to explain to me by what means you have determined it to be the most significant. The way you appear to account for this priority is by insisting on the horrific nature of the violence, by disseminating photographs of dismembered and mutilated fetuses, by calling abortion an "unmitigated evil," and by demonizing all those who are more or less complicit in its practice. Still, the insufferable nature of abortion alone does not argue for its exceptional or pre-eminent nature, and it does little for your argument simply to insist on this exceptional status by means of testimony or examples.	   [1] Incidentally: 1.5 million dollars seems to me a cynically cheap price to pay for the appearance of legitimacy and justice, when at least 10 thousand civilians had been killed by November of last year at the time the payments were reported by the U.S. military; one need only compare that price to the average price dolled out to each family of the 9-11 attacks, which was nothing other than 1.5 million dollars. 10,000 to 1: is that a fair ratio by which to establish the value of an American life, and the suffering that the loss of that life causes, when compared to the life of an Iraqi, and the suffering Iraqi families undergo who lose their loved ones to reckless, overblown, unjustified military violence? Not even the disparity between the wealth of these individuals and their families could come close to justifying this stark contrast, since the poorest families whose relatives died in the 9-11 attacks received 300,000 dollars each. So, if you think of these questions, and if you take in reports on what is happening in Fallujah these days from a source other than  Fox News  (as I hope you do), would you still argue, if only by implication, that the U.S. forces have treated civilians with only mitigated violence?  [2]I refer to the following paragraph: "You stated that, "although even one child's death is a tragedy, Bush's 'complicity' in these deaths is indirect and remote." I wonder, do you mean to imply thereby that a pro-abortion candidate such as Kerry is, by contrast, directly and immediately complicit in the deaths of the unborn? If so, on what basis have you made this distinction? Whereas Kerry is (implicitly, but unmistakably) deemed complicit directly and immediately, Bush is deemed "complicit" (in hedging scare quotes) only indirectly and remotely. As for me, nothing jumps out as being so dissimilar in these two cases. We are talking about politicians who have the power to effect legislation that, in turn, leads to such events as preventable abortions and deaths by preventable diseases. How, then, were you able to distribute your judgments so differently in the two cases? And how were you able to do it without having studied the question of preventable diseases worldwide and the neglect of the issue by both George Bush and the Congress of the United States?

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written on April 16.] #15  Fanni writes:  In your most recent message, you depicted me as "doing the same thing that you are doing." I see this as a mischaracterization because it fails to take into account the dogmatic principle as I have identified it above (and because you have not established, in accordance with this claim, that I employ a similarly dogmatic principle in regard to corporations). You depict yourself as "weighing plusses and minuses" as any responsible multi-issue voter would, but this characterization falsifies every essential point you have made about abortion so as to make it "the most significant issue." You wrote:   "I am doing the same thing you are doing, looking at an imperfect politician (I assume you don't agree with Kerry on every point, particularly the abortion rights point), looking at and assessing the evidence of his plusses and minuses, and coming up with more plusses."   This attempt to establish parallelism between our approaches neglects the fact that, support for abortion, for you, and for reasons that you haven't explained, constitutes a massive minus, a minus so massive that it overrides all other possible pluses – so massive that it does not even permit a quantitative comparison with other types of killing and suffering and injustice or "evil." As for me, I do not approach any one form of violence or injustice with a dogmatic assumption that it is qualitatively far worse than any other. So, when you write,   "I could ask you the same question you appear to be asking me. How many unborn a day need to be killed before you disavow your loyalty [sic] to the man who has vowed to continue to work to expand abortion rights here and abroad?,"  my answer is that, to assess the importance of the number of abortions per day and decide what weight I should give this factor in my assessment of any given pro- or anti-abortion candidate, I need to consider the incidents of abortion in light of other forms of violence, both in a quantitative and qualitative comparison, as well as the candidate's record on addressing this and other forms of violence and the likelihood of the candidate's effecting change. I would have to make a new decision for every candidate and every new context, and never assume the contrary. In some cases, the violence done to the unborn will weigh more heavily than in others. To take a present example, it is my view that pernicious Bush administration policies in so many different areas have caused the issue of abortion to fade in importance in the 2004 presidential election, which is not at all to say that this situation makes abortion more permissible or even 'mitigated'; rather, it is to judge its perniciousness in light of other pernicious activities, many of which are not describable as corporate in nature.   Being a "baby killer" or not being a "baby killer" are not the only two ways of existing in the world. There is also a way that accounts for the violence of abortion other than as a radical, unparalleled evil. This other way tries to diminish the violence of abortion in accordance with its importance in respect to other types of violence. In other words, in taking this approach, I do not begin with the assumption that there is one qualitatively pre-eminent form of unmitigated evil in the world, or at least that there is one unmitigated evil that is the world's most pernicious form of unmitigated evil – the most unmitigated, if you will. And I am not, for that reason – as you seem to be – obliged to assume and to demonstrate if necessary that all other evils or forms of violence are merely mitigated, or less unmitigated than the evil of abortion. You have been resourceful in identifying such mitigating circumstances and qualities by arguing that this or that violence is merely mitigated because, for example, the president did not personally and single-handedly create the worldwide conditions which have led to millions of preventable fatal illnesses; it is not really known if Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat to the United States (despite – I insist here – massive evidence to the contrary); the American soldiers who killed civilians had been fired upon; the U.S. military reports that it handed out a little bit of money to some of the families of their innocent victims; only several hundred cluster bombs were used in civilian areas, and only several hundred civilians were immediately killed by them; only 17,000 or more Iraqis have been conclusively documented thus far to have been victims of U.S. aggression and therefore "tens of thousands" is an exaggeration, etc., ad infinitum.   Unlike you, I am not motivated to elect abortion or any other form of violence as the one unmitigated violence, or the one, 'most unmitigated' violence. (And this is a separate issue, but I am also not motivated to limit my intake of news largely to one single news engine that agrees with my view on a single form of violence, and subsequently to dismiss all other news and investigative agencies as what Bill O’Reilly from Fox News sweepingly calls "elite media.") Although I am not nearly as thoroughly schooled in the history of abortion and its debates and the details of its practices as you are, I have a general awareness of it as a social practice, and a general sense of how widely it is used, how, and by whom. I am not compelled, as you are with respect to so many issues of injustice, to diminish its importance  a priori .   This difference between you and me has fed much of our discussion, and cannot now be swept aside, because I continue to mark my inability to follow you on the distinction you make between, on the one hand, the violence of abortion and all the responsibilities that are tied to it and, on the other, all other forms of violence and the responsibilities that are tied to them. To give another example, I do not understand why the decapitation by U.S. firepower of a three-year old bystander in Iraq is any more a mitigated form of violence and injustice than is the destruction of a three-month old fetus. In fact, I think this distinction between "mitigated" and "unmitigated" is problematic and ill-suited for this purpose, and I would refrain from using it in assessing the qualitative differences between different forms of violence (whose existence it would be ridiculous to deny, but would call for more refined qualifications). It would be perhaps easy to agree upon the reprehensible nature of any single act of violence, without consideration for anything but the time and place in which it occurred, but I would like to know if we could also agree about the nature of unmitigable offenses generally.   Even if we cannot agree on that principled level, there is a pragmatic argument that calls for not assuming that one form of killing is inherently the worst. If life were what mattered to you most, you would be willing to support, I assume, a candidate whose policies could make a serious dent in, if not eradicate, the 10.5 million infant deaths that occur annually worldwide on account of easily preventable diseases rather than a candidate that has a long shot at best – as George Bush does – at halting all the abortions that take place in the United States. Even if all the abortions in the United States were halted and all the fetuses went on to thrive as democratic citizens, far fewer lives would be saved by the complete eradication of abortions in the United States any given year than can easily be saved, beginning in the short term, by following the W.H.O. guidelines for addressing the 10.5 million annual infant deaths. (Preventing abortions worldwide would be an even taller order and, as his record demonstrates amply, George Bush is hardly the sort of leader who can marshal international support for U.S.-led initiatives, especially those that, for better or for worse, touch on the Christian heritage.) The international organizations capable of addressing these preventable diseases are already in place, and the project of, say, curbing the significant number of fatal malarial infections in Africa is not as politically divisive as is the project of outlawing abortion in the United States. Thus, such a humanitarian project, which has stalled alongside many others under the watch of a corporatized presidency, would be inclined to receive less resistance, and meet with greater success. The W.H.O. expert in the report we read claims that eradicating this number of preventable deaths would be relatively easy, with the proper financial support. Now, this is hardly a hair-brained 'hypothetical' at which you can simply respond by saying, "I don't go there," or a presentation of figures pulled out of the air with the intent of obscuring facts. What surprises me is that, after so many years of advocating "life" and a "respect for life," and the "right to life," you seemed unaware of the extent of the ravages of easily preventable diseases on human populations. The question, in any case, becomes one of whether, in learning about these ravages, you would consider either shifting your fight for life to where it can likely have a dramatic consequence in the short term (by, for instance, informing yourself better on these issues and writing to your Congress members and to the President to complain about their irresponsible slothfulness and indifference with respect to these preventable diseases snuffing out children's lives) or giving up the pretense of fighting primarily for life and admit that there is some other force or principle animating the groups that appropriate "life" as their rallying cry by calling themselves "pro-life" while simultaneously limiting themselves to the narrow topic of abortion (whose narrowness I think is apparent when considered in light of many other life-and-death issues).   Although I don’t understand the basis for your distinction between mitigated and unmitigated "evil," I perhaps do understand its necessity and the importance it holds for you. I say this because, to be able to so organize your political orientation in line with a single issue, you must disallow any other violence or evil of being fully unmitigated in the way you feel abortion is because, if that were not the case, then the other unmitigated violence or evil could just as easily serve to organize all of your solidarities and antipathies and, as a consequence, abortion would risk becoming permissible in many contexts, alongside many other secondary forms of violence. If you found a leader to be against unmitigated evil X, but whose support for other issues included support for abortion, then you would have to give your support to this leader solely because unmitigated evil X commands your attention overwhelmingly. And that, I think, is why I believe this single-issue approach to politics is untenable: because, in its arbitrary quest to eradicate a single form of violence, it is destined to support or show indifference towards multiple other forms of violence. That is the point I would most like you to reflect on; and this point, I insist, does not relate only to abortion or to abortion directly, in a substantive way, since it would apply, as well, to any other single issue that one would so embrace.

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE and earlier installments are archived in April. The following was written on April 16.]#16  Fanni:  The radical difference between your and my approach to politics is that you equate abortion with injustice itself, whereas I am concerned with fighting injustice in whatever form it comes. Unlike you, I am not compelled to vilify all those who may be complicit in a single form of violence or injustice, irrespective of their actions in other areas. Moreover, I argue that your purist attachment to a single issue is inherently unethical. This is true, I think, for reasons that can be understood as being simply quantitative. Let me explain. Since you equate abortion with an act of murder or consider abortion to be even worse than any pedestrian or military act of killing (for reasons you have stated concerning the pre-eminent status of the "right to life"), then it stands to reason that you would give your full, unqualified support to any anti-abortion tyrant who promised to kill no more than 42 million innocent, mature, fully ambulatory individuals per year, since this, roughly speaking, is the number that, if I am not mistaken, is cited for abortions committed per year worldwide, both legally and illegally. A few lines from your message seem indirectly relevant here:   "Hitler was pro-abortion for ethnic groups he did not like and anti-abortion for ethnic groups he did like."  So, on the former point, you would have voted against him, but what if there were a viable political opponent to Hitler who was pro-abortion in all cases? In that situation, obviously, Hitler would win your support, whether or not you find it palatable now to admit to this implication of your views. That is, you would support Hitler or any tyrant much worse than Hitler as long as the tyrant promised to protect by law and enforcement at least 43 million fetuses (previously threatened with abortion) so that they would at least see the light of day. By this logic (which is entirely in keeping with what you have said till this point), a million lives would be saved per year, and the world would have cause for celebration. (And, if I might add, in such a venture, healthy corporate gains could be had, in what you might see as a classic case of mitigating corporate influence, since destroying and disposing of some 42 million bodies would certainly require labor, equipment, and other things that corporations specialize in, and since corporations would best make the whole procedure run economically, with as little waste and redundancy as possible.) In essence, you would embrace the assassins of the human race as long as they maintained respect for and full maturation of all fetuses. If this is not true, I invite you to explain why it is not true. Of course, you will be moved to interrupt this hypothetical moment to reject it out of hand precisely because you only address "existing conditions." But this is only one way of portraying implications of views you have already shared with me and thus it doesn't require your approval. Moreover, in light of such implications, your corrective remarks about whether the U.S. military killed 17,000 or, rather, 20,000 Iraqis, and whether my using "tens of thousands" as a way of describing the number of people killed in Iraq is a gross exaggeration, or simply an exaggeration, seem pointless. In any case, I am sure that in calling "tens of thousands" of Iraqi dead a "gross exaggeration," you had imagined that far less than 17,000 had been killed. I do not personally recall  Fox News  ever reporting on the number of Iraqis killed, but perhaps you had heard from  Fox News  a far more modest number than 17,000. There is something incongruous between, on the one hand, the  Fox News  presentation of the war as being surgical, "smart," righteous, aesthetically distributed between regions of city and country, "pre-emptive," "anti-terrorist," properly and proportionately retributive; and, on the other hand, the knowledge that thousands of civilians have been killed needlessly, many randomly, as well as thousands of civilians who saw themselves as defending their country, however corrupt they knew its former leadership to be, and, moreover, that thousands will still die even if all fighting ceased today because of the effects of the U.S. military's use of depleted uranium, because of stray weapons of death (including landmines and outdated cluster bombs) that will still claim many victims, and because of serous health problems relating to the devastated infrastructure and environment of Iraq.[1]    You offer a few concessionary remarks to smooth over what you presume are only rough edges in your support for what I think are war-thirsty, fossil-fuel entrenched, heartless politics. "I'm ambivalent about the war. I don't agree with everything the Republicans do. I don't support killing civilians. I offset harmful Republican policies with a few targeted donations, etc." The only possible way such concessionary moments, and their at best faint consequences, could set the balances straight with your support of Bush is if you were assured that your basic position was one of pre-eminent righteousness and that therefore any support you give to, for example, broad-ranging, indiscriminate, unjustified military violence as a solution to political or national security problems, or to wide-scale degradation of the environment, or to the ruthless privatization of education and basic social services, merely benefits mitigated evils – evils that do not carry the full punch of the unmitigated evil of abortion and that can therefore all be rationalized or brushed off, or brushed up, in one way or another, individually or as a whole, since they pale in comparison to evil unmitigated. I find this assurance on your part to be wholly untenable. It is certainly unsupported by anything you have said till this point.   [1] A Japanese research group whose public session I attended the other day in Osaka provided evidence that, due to the U.S. military's use of depleted uranium in its fighting in Afghanistan, maladies of all types among Afghani children under the age of 15, many of which are deforming in nature, are up 400 percent from where they were before the hostilities were engaged. This is a minor addition to our discussion, and the effects of depleted uranium on public health is an issue that remains disputed by the U.S. military, but it reminds us that much of the human toll of war cannot be calculated or quantified in the short term, if ever. For that reason, I would underscore that correcting a death count downward from 20,000 to 17,000, as you did in a previous message, is very likely not as decisive as it may at first appear.   --end--

       [The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE.The following was written on April 16.]  #17  Fanni:  I find abortion to be a needless violence but I think that we should not lose sight of the fact that a greater danger is facing us, one that is multi-faceted and not only menaces the unborn but ultimately – without ceding to hyperbole – undercuts world stability and the prospects for the survival of the human race on planet Earth, which is to say, all those who are born and as yet unborn, in this age and further on. This danger presents itself variously as belligerent, deceitful, and unjust war-making dressed up as a "war on terror" for the sake of a relatively short-term supply of fossil fuel and that risks fomenting terrorism-inspiring hatred for generations to come; a billion-dollar annual corporate welfare program that subsidizes the refinement of environment-threatening fossil fuels; and a near-total neglect of investment in renewable energy technologies, all to the great detriment of our future economy and ecology. (I mean "near total neglect" relative to our "defense budget," which has reached nearly 400 billion dollars a year and dwarfs the spending on "defense" of all our potential and real enemies combined and that, moreover, remains the one expenditure that, when questioned to any degree, swiftly becomes a vehicle for George Bush's ridiculing the questioner, since, we must never forget, George is "a war president" and there is no limit to the amount of weaponry and support a war president must command.) There is much more that could be said on this issue, since the nefarious influence of the Bush administration on world peace, stability, and longevity, is a phenomenon that is vast, sprawling, and impossible for anyone to document fully, and so I will have to limit myself to these few remarks for considerations of space and time.   Lastly, I think that, to make the argument against abortion acceptable to the non-converted, one would do better to place it in a continuum with other forms of violence, including violence against women, rather than to argue for its exceptional nature. Certainly the women's rights groups that oppose abortion would find this approach more palatable.  And, to conclude, let me say that I am not addressing you as if you were just any old run-of-the-mill Bush voter, or single-issue voter, or anti-abortion activist. What brings me to raise all these questions with you is the realization that, of all the values I believe we have in common, virtually nothing is in accord with the priorities and practices of the Bush administration. If I knew you to be a longtime Republican who, like Bush Republicans, sought out economic exploitation of others wherever he could find it and everywhere preached fear and practiced bullying unilateralism, I wouldn't have made this effort to mark my dissatisfaction with the path you have taken in supporting George Bush. None of the values we grew up with were those of Bush Republicanism. We never maintained corporate values above civic values; we weren't given to bowing before the altar of greed; we didn't resort to violence as a means of solving problems; we didn't pollute and deride the importance of nature; we didn't cherish a misinterpretation of the Second Amendment as a way to promote the proliferation of weapons; we didn't believe that we should fight to benefit the most powerful members of society and treat the poor and the downtrodden as enemies of state prosperity; we never victimized innocent people as a way to vent power and appear steadfast in the face of fictitious threats; we didn't think cynically of news agencies and reporters in general as a "special interest" that works to delude us and has no proper role in questioning the government; we didn't consider it fitting and right that American workers and families should be denied a living wage; we weren't persuaded to embrace militarism and military jargon uncritically; we never selected a single, predominant source of information that would serve to assure us of the righteousness of a single cause and put all that causes's imagined or real opponents in a bad light; we wouldn't have accepted the idea that men and boys being imprisoned for years without charge or recourse to legal advice is worthy of a democratic government; we never claimed that the death penalty is preventive or just; we never diminished all issues relating to the furtherance of justice to the presumed benefit of one issue; and we didn't embrace a single issue with fanaticism, to the neglect or disdain of so many others. Nonetheless, you are willing to turn away from this precious heritage because "abortion is an unmitigated evil." I am sure that I cannot persuade you to do otherwise, but I want you to know that I am determined to stick with this heritage, in all its richness, rather than to embrace a blinding and unjustified attachment to a single issue and, on that basis, let the Bush administration assault civic values in a way that has life-and-death consequences both directly and immediately and for the longevity of the human race. In embracing the just fight against abortion, you may feel that you have beaten a straight path to righteousness, but I believe that such a path, if it exists, can only be tortuous and uncertain. Even a just cause can be embraced unjustly, just as the just war on terrorism can be fought poorly and unjustly, as it has been by the Bush administration.  What concerns me, as I close this message, is the possibility that if I have revealed your not having made tenable or consistent arguments for either your single-issue approach to politics or for your support (on those same grounds, or others) for the Bush administration, it would be in line with your single-issue persistence for your "position" to grow even more hardened and exclusionary and that you will be forced to lump me together resolutely with those whom you think of as baby killers and assassins, and thus to shut down all forms of meaningful dialogue with me.   Hoping sincerely that that is not the case, I ask you to reflect at length on any reply you would kindly give me.

The following was written on April 16.]#18  Fanni:  To conclude my response, I return to some minor points concerning the drift of our discussion. You wrote:   "I did not say cluster bombs were not used in Iraq, I said they were not used in cities. I stand corrected by the USA Today article. You stand corrected on the number of civilian casualties: You said, 'Calling to death by U.S. firepower and cluster bombs of tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Iraq.'"  I accept that you stand corrected and thank you for your honesty in admitting so. I accounted for your having stated precisely that the cluster bombs were not used in cities (that was the entire point of the p.s. to one of my messages). Allow me to copy the most salient remarks (adding emphasis):  To be precise, you made a distinction between the city and country use of cluster bombs...I don't want you to think that I misunderstood the nature of your flatly false impression. Even more pertinent to your false impression that cluster bombs were not used in cities, then, is the first sentence from the article to which I sent you a link already: "BAGHDAD. The little canisters dropped onto the city, white ribbons trailing behind. They clattered into streets, landed in lemon trees, rattled around on roofs, settled onto lawns." And one could add, from further on in the article, the following: "U.S. forces fired hundreds of cluster weapons into urban areas."  You then quoted several numbers from the  USA Today  report on cluster bomb use by the U.S. military:   "The  USA Today  article said: 'U.S. forces fired hundreds of cluster weapons from late March to early April, killed dozens and possibly hundreds of Iraqi civilians.' 'One anti-war group calculates that cluster weapons killed as many as 372 Iraqi citizens.'"   Yes, the article does say those things. And that is why it would be naive to believe that the U.S. forces have not harmed and killed civilians unnecessarily. It would also be a dereliction of citizenship not to reflect on the nature of this unnecessary, lawless killing, and ask what its implications are in the "war on terror" in particular, and the consequences of this terror-fomenting and terrorizing use of force not only for those directly involved in the violence, but for future generations of citizens the world over. You also quoted this line from the same report:    "Iraq Body Count...attributes 200 to 372 Iraqi civilian deaths to cluster bombs..."  That was indeed reported; however, it would be irresponsible to quote this last statement without also considering the long-term harm of cluster bombs. This long-term harm is one of the main reasons why this type of weapon as used by the U.S. Army has long been in dispute, as was pointed out in the report you read recently and as discussed widely in debates that you apparently were wholly unaware of before we began our discussion. At the very least, you should have quoted the following statement as well, from the same report:  	  "The attacks also left behind thousands of unexploded bomblets, known as duds, that continued to kill and injure Iraqi civilians weeks after the fighting stopped."  I do commend you once again on accepting to entertain, at least in an abstract way, a critical attitude towards the Bush administration. I say this because you wrote the following: "I do not approve of killing civilians or of war, nor do I approve of all that the Bush administration does."  I consider the massive killing of Iraqis – the number of which killings, however disputed it is certain to remain, is certain to grow, and has been fattened by a reported 900 deaths in Fallujah this week alone – the majority of which killings involve civilians whose only "fault" was to be living under the command of a tyrant who was falsely accused of being an imminent threat to another tyrant, to constitute massive killing in the same way that "tens of thousands of deaths" is massive, and I see no principle of difference between any numbers I have cited within the range presented by various sources of 17,000 to 55,000 total dead. And let us not forget that the assumption that the soldiers killed were killed justly rests on the highly disputed claim that the U.S. aggression was just, and justified. In any case, this past year, we have witnessed, in the name of democracy and U.S. security, a massive, often indiscriminate violence unleashed on the Iraqi people. Voting for those who have shamelessly overseen the massive killing of civilians and who wage aggressive wars built on a false rationale and phony evidence will, despite your selective criticisms, mark your approval of the Bush administration and thus mark approval or indifference towards the killing of civilians in Iraq this past year in particular (as well as toward a lot of other violence carried out or permitted by the Bush administration in many areas, especially, in my view, with respect to the natural environment). There is no vote that can say, "I support your anti-abortion language and politics, but some or even most of the rest of your actions and policies I reject." That is one reason why, as a voter, viewing the issue of abortion as if it existed in a vacuum of ethical certitudes is both impossible and irresponsible. 	  After you cited statistics from the  USA Today  report of the U.S. Army's use of cluster bombs in civilian areas in Iraq, you added a strangely unqualified and not properly introduced or referenced statistical claim:    "In the two months of March-April 2003, 218,833 innocent human beings were killed by abortion in the U.S."  Is this an attempt to gesture towards an argument? If you would like to make an argument that calls for the importance of calculating and comparing numbers of abortions with numbers of deaths caused by other factors, I invite you to do so. I suspect, too, for reasons I explain in my message above, that such an open-minded inquiry would lead you to some surprising conclusions.   I questioned how you feel abortion as a life-and-death issue compares to other life-and-death issues. I have also given pragmatic reasons why voting for Bush is not voting for life, and why candidates who do not cede to corporate indifference in the face of human suffering – there is little profit in the prevention of preventable diseases – can have a much greater impact on life-and-death issues than can Bush. In any case, I invite you to make this argument and note that it stands in contrast to everything you have said to justify abortion as an unmitigated violence; or, in short, to your argument that, for reasons of principle, abortion is a primary form of violence or perhaps  the  primary form of violence – a form of violence that cuts at the root of the right to life and cannot therefore be properly compared, on quantifiable terms, to other forms of life-threatening or life-ending violence done to living beings, which beings have at least enjoyed the basic right to life. I have given reasons that I think expose the dubious nature of this second line of thinking, and you have left these reasons without comment. Specifically, the claim that the fetus is the "origin of life" obviously neglects the fact that, without a stable, nurturing natural and human environment, no fetus would ever be created. Granting it the status of "absolute origin" thus serves to dismiss a whole range of increasingly menacing challenges to human life, and to diminish cruelly the importance of the unborn who are not yet fetuses, as if life deserved respect only at the moment that a fetus is created, and no sooner, and not from a more general perspective. To conclude, although I do not think I will persuade you to change your thinking in any substantial way, I am marking here both principled and pragmatic doubts concerning the basis of your support for George Bush and his pernicious administration of national and international affairs.

        urlLink The Observer | Review | Michael and me  This more than 20,000-word article by Anthony Andrews of the  Observer  announces itself in this way:    "The film-maker who could help to bring down Bush has been larging it at Cannes. He has made millions asking awkward questions of corporate America. But there are a few awkward questions we'd like to ask him..."  This is an effective announcement, since it encapsulates well the article that follows, including the author's insinuations that Moore is hypocritical because he is wealthy and because he enjoyed himself at Cannes last week, as well as the (surely unintended) acknowledgment that the author could think of only awkward questions to ask Moore during his Cannes interview of the filmmaker. You might think that, with 20,000 words to spend on a figure who has attracted so much attention of late, and over such important issues, Andrews might have prepared some broad-minded inquiries to help inform himself and the public. What he asks Moore is this:   1. Do you regret your vote for Nader in 2000? 2. Why did you send your daughter to a nice school?  -and- 3. Why did your friend Ben Harper [ a former Flint auto-worker whom Moore helped to become a writer ] say that you don't treat people well?  For a journalist who complains about the fact that he got only 15 minutes to question Moore, it seems odd that these questions were all he could think to ask, or report on, or introduce with such bravado. What more could we have expected him to reveal, had he been granted another 15 minutes? Personally, my expectations have been all but erased. Can you imagine Andrews's managing editor, dispatching him to Cannes with this remark: "Tony, make sure you find out why Moore's friend said what he did about Moore that one day. Oh, and, definitely get right on that bit about the schoolgirl -- you know, his daughter. There could be something there, perhaps a key to that Fahrenheit flick that's been makin' such noise, who knows?"   I would indeed call Andrews's questions "awkward," given the trouble he went to to ask them, report on them, and dress them up as compelling investigative reporting. The answers Moore gave, incidentally, were simple enough:    1. No.  2. Because we didn't want to send her to an unsafe one.   -and-  3. When speaking on that occasion, Ben was drunk and admitted so to me in a letter afterwards.  One shouldn't overlook the reason for which these questions were reported on by Andrews, which was to establish that Moore "only ever established a partial relation to the truth." (If you can follow that line of thinking, please tell me how you managed...)  Concerning the second question, Andrews writes:    "Of course, it's nobody's business but Moore's where he sends his child, except he makes it his business to detail the hereditary [sic] privilege of his subjects and tends to make his political arguments personal."   Is Andrews suggesting that, to avoid hypocrisy and obtain a full relation to the truth, Moore would have to ensure that his daughter obtain no privilege whatsoever from her father's flourishing? That seems like a lot to ask of him, especially since Moore has never criticized anyone simply on the basis of their inherited privilege but only as the person's political views and actions relate to their privileged background.  Aside from the fact that this article is constructed on such fluff, it does raise a few points of substance with respect to Moore's work. Andrews has the merit of actually having seen  Fahrenheit 9/11  and, in fact, has nothing but praise for it, saying, for instance, that, "such is the cumulative force of the film, with its kinetic humour and insistent sentiment, that it is hard to come away from it without concluding a) that George W Bush is not fit to be president of a golf club let alone the world's most powerful nation and b) the war in Iraq was woefully misconceived."  So, to appear critical, even to the point where he  seems  to be emulating Moore's own investigative rigor, Andrews resorts to i) questioning the "trustworthiness" of Moore's work generally and ii) attacking Moore's character on the basis of hearsay and spiteful personal observations. The second tactic I have already spoken of. As for the first, Andrews tries to pull this off on the strength of a single example. Here's what he writes:   "[In]  Bowling for Columbine  the audience is led to believe that the two teenage killers at Columbine high school may have been inured to violence by the proximity of a local weapons factory. Yet it later emerged that the factory produced nothing more lethal than rockets to launch TV satellites."  This is a particularly interesting rebuttal because it speaks to the nature of Moore's films. Nonetheless, it is misleading to claim that  Bowling for Columbine  suggests that it is the mere  proximity  of the weapons factory that "inured" the students to violence. The factory had the role of a symbol of entrenched investement in military violence by the United States; this point was particularly clear when Moore discussed bombings ordered by Clinton on the day the Columbine shootings took place. Whether the factory actually produced weapons or not would matter little, as long as the children were impacted (as they certainly were) by a general culture of violence in the United States. The possibility that Moore may have been mistaken about this particular factory does nothing to diminish the force of his inquiry. There may be other suspect details and "omissions" in Moore's films, but I am not convinced that Moore's films should be considered "documentaries" and held up to the same criteria as documentaries are. Moore's investigations are much more powerful and interesting than any conventionally understood documentary.   I would agree that we cannot trust Moore's films, nor Moore, for that matter, to have a comprehensive grasp of all the facts relating to his muckraking enterprises. But that is not his role. Moore pounces on his subject matter with all his heart and raises some dust in the effort. Moore's role is to raise questions in a way that holds the public's attention and, if possible, inspires the public to action. Thus his films are "critical" films in the Marxist sense of this word. They want not only to interpret the world, but to change it.  Andrews also makes the charge that Moore's liberal nature has been compromised by his being  surrounding by  "paranoia." I would think that a person who has taken on such powerful targets, and who knows the viciousness of certain of his adversaries, would have reason to want personal protection.   Be that as it may, Moore's unapologetic approach to politics and art seems to inspire envy among his adversaries. The latter aspire to imitate the determined investigator in Michael Moore by attempting to turn the tables on him. What better examples of this than the resentment-brimming projects such as these?   1. http://www.moorewatch.com/  This is a group-maintained blog dedicated to smearing Michael Moore on whatever basis possible. Falling short on argumentative skills, it makes frequent recourse to the single word "b---shit" to counter others' statements. It also slides into the French bashing trap that Moore correctly foresaw would be sprung after his film's celebration at Cannes.    2. http://www.michaelmoorehatesamerica.com/  This is a "film project" designed to focus on the fascinating topic (!) of Michael Moore. It is fronted by a self-glossed "passionate guy with a camera" who is bent on attacking Moore as a way of defending (a fascist and simplistic idea of) the "homeland."   What the people behind these projects forget is that what makes Moore's investigations compelling is not simply their "method," but the human significance of the issues they address; to which one should add, as well, their  originality  and, no less, their forceful relation to truth.

         For today's post, I offer an Onion-style article...  Note: I cannot assure that all the links open to their original destinations.    THE FREEDOM ROLLER DEBUTS THIS MONTH   Tuesday September 16, 9:35 AM ET   By Fanni Terrette, Press Writer   (MP) Washington, D.C. The Department of Defense has teamed up with Generic Motors to offer American drivers a new line of All-American Sports Utility Tanks (SUTs). The perfect vehicles for these times of international terrorism, the near 60-ton Sports Utility Tanks not only allow citizens a new way to exercise their second-amendment right to responsible self-defense, they are widely considered the safest passenger vehicle ever designed. Indeed, the manufacturers guarantee SUT drivers and passengers complete safety in head-on collisions of up to 30 M.P.H. SUTs have a city mileage of only 3 gallons per mile, but their relative lack of fuel efficiency is easily counterbalanced by a wide variety of comforts not typically associated with combat vehicles. The first official SUT, the Freedom Roller, is resplendent with numerous suburban comforts, including a mobile home theater that boasts satellite hook-up and multiple plasma TV screens, built-in soft-drink dispensers, an electric potato slicer and deep-fryer, and handguns ranging in size and power for each member of the family.   DRIVING THE WAR ON TERROR   Although the combat capacity of the vehicles is not likely to be called upon regularly in everyday use, C. John Hedge, Secretary of the Department of Motherland Purity (  urlLink  news    -   urlLink  web sites   ), has praised the arrival of the new civilian-friendly SUT fleet, citing the vehicles' strategic benefits:      "The financial burden of the war on terror has exceeded local budgets in most counties throughout the nation. Therefore, rather than increase the size of an already unwieldy bureaucracy, we have mobilized the private sector to give the citizens the means to exercise their anti-terrorist vigilance to the full. Together, we will hunt down and bring to justice all terrorists who dare set foot on, or drive across, the Motherland."   Secretary Hedge brought his brief press conference to a close in an uncharacteristic display of vigor by hoisting his right fist into the air and making an eloquent appeal to the families of America by declaring the Department of Motherland Purity motto: "We can be afraid, or we can be ready. Today America's families declare, 'We will not be afraid. We will be ready!' One individual, one family, one community, one motor vehicle at a time." In a separate statement released by the Department of Justice (  urlLink  news    -   urlLink  web sites   ), the Attorney General Ashley Croft, commenting on the recent arrival of SUTs, said, "We are disrupting potential terrorist travel; and we are building our long-term counter-terrorism capacity. We are winning the war on terror, and we will not back down." As the Attorney General explained, the Department of Justice hopes to bring terrorist travel to a complete halt on the streets of America. With SUTs overwhelming local and interstate traffic, it is hoped that terrorists will be dissuaded from taking to the road and, eventually, be rooted out from every thoroughfare and preemptively blocked from every byway.   GRUMBLINGS   Civil libertarians have objected to the fact that the Department of Motherland Purity has intervened to require that all citizens hoping to acquire an SUT first pass a Patriot Drivers Test. This inexpensive test requires the prospective buyer to, among other things, recite by heart the capitals of the fifty U.S. States, swear disobedience to Allah, and renounce all heathen superstitions generally. Radical groups (  urlLink  news    -   urlLink  web sites   ) have taken exception to this safe-guarding measure. In an open letter circulated widely on the Internet, Edward Tinmar, professor of English at Columbia University, has written, in an apparent allusion to recent propaganda that anachronistically imagines Jesus Christ picking and choosing among today's fleet of passenger vehicles, the following tidbit: "For the next academic cycle, I am proposing a course on the relations between one's religious convictions and one's choice of utility vehicle. The topic is increasingly relevant in today's society and a truly critical attitude vis-à-vis the corporatization of government in the United States should start here."   AFFORDABILITY   Elitist ruminations aside, Americans have unambiguously welcomed the arrival of SUTs to the civilian market. Indeed, the consumer confidence index has leaped in the first quarter, up from 65.1 to 78.7, and few commentators doubt the benign influence of SUTs on the index. Although this spectacular leap has no doubt been supported by a vigorous ad campaign, the first quarter economic upswing has been attributed more generally to a greater sense of security among suburbanites who now can envisage protecting their accumulated property without having to rely upon a bureaucracy-laden police force. Further adding to the buying frenzy is the benign effect of legislation that, although originally proposed for crop-dusters and grain-transporting vehicles, has been found to apply as well to all manner of full-size urban vehicles. This law assures buyers an immediate deduction of as much as $38,000 off the price of an SUT. The President has said of this incentive, "Uh... this is a plan that says that if you are willing to take risk and invest more, there's a benefit for doing so. And... uh... it'll create millions of jobs and be positive... economically." There is a hitch, however. As things currently stand, the credit applies only to vehicles weighing 60 tons or more. Owners of the Freedom Roller, which, through a freak of design, weighs only 59 1/2 tons, have therefore been encouraged to weigh their vehicles down by secondary means—stacks of tightly fastened barbells or what-have-you—in order to qualify for the tax credit.   CRIME-FIGHTING BENEFITS   SUTs promise more than an affordable means of modern transportation. With the type of armament that the SUT makes available to a vigilant public, city and county law enforcement officials are eagerly anticipating wide-scale public assistance in their daily crime-fighting operations. Reckless car chases, it is hoped, will soon be a thing of the past. Those fleeing from the law can now be neutralized at great distances by SUT owners who recognize the threat and act swiftly. Concerned at the possible compromise that this development may represent for some of its most popular nightly programs (such as the roundly celebrated "PIGS," which features the turbulent pursuit and humiliation of petty criminals), a spokesperson for the Foxxy Network, Mr. Thurman Reich, said that Foxxy is planning a new program that will focus entirely on SUT-assisted police operations. He has assured viewers that there will be no diminution of gratuitous bullying and fear-mongering in the new format and that the entertainment value of the program will even be heightened by increasingly explosive public confrontations. (SUT-drivers hoping to participate in these operations are asked to call the Foxxy Network toll-free at 1-666-588-2874.)   There are also arrangements underway that will allow SUT drivers to participate in such crime-busting exercises in a more organized manner. The recently formed SUT Club, Inc. has commandeered a number of its members into a veritable vigilante fleet, capable of responding to the behest of local or federal officials. This drivers club (  urlLink  web site   ) describes itself as a not-for-profit corporation whose aims are to promote the adventurous and safe use of SUTs and to encourage its members to act as a social force for the security of the Motherland. It and similar clubs will be free to embark on deer hunting expeditions, take diversionary excursions through Yellowstone National Park, or patrol gang-infested neighborhoods and quell public expressions of political dissent. The crime-fighting benefits may even be called upon by the federal government to battle terror itself. With sufficient training, it is thought, such a club could one day confront brutal dictators suspected of potentially harboring, or conceiving of, or being able to share their conceptions of, WMD-related-program activities (and thereby spare the government from having to make academic presentations at the United Nations or appease dilly-dallying allies while threats gravely gather). With such a swiftly acting force at its command, the government could redirect its military spending to much needed nuclear and space-oriented weaponry. Till this point, however, the enormous potential of this domestic force on the international theater has been held up by considerations of personal insurance.   OPERATION EDUCATION LIBERTY   The most unexpected development of this cooperation between the Department of Defense and the private sector has been articulated compellingly by the Secretary of Education Carl Freeman. Freeman, whose swaggering style and unshakeable self-confidence play particularly well on Foxxy, MPNEWS, and other balanced networks, has argued that the tactics used against brutal dictatorships that torture their people can also be turned toward the failing educational system in the Motherland as a way to tilt it toward decisive improvements. Citing the Arab Development Reports, which state among other things that the Greeks have translated more works from English than have all the Arab nations combined, Freeman notes that, "those numbers are the context that produced 9-11." He then cites the well-known statistics of failing schools in America and concludes as follows: "If you don't visit a bad neighborhood in this world, it will visit you, and on 9-11, it visited us." The upshot of Freeman's argument is that failing schools can no longer be suffered by a nation perpetually at war. Spurred on by its stunningly accomplished mission in Iraq, the Pentagon has thus committed itself, under Freeman's advisement, to Operation Education Liberty. This campaign will certainly shape the business of education for years to come. Its goal is to visit every failing school, every potential harbor of intellectual darkness and terror. In this way, schools not meeting accountability outcomes will have their charters revoked by means of force. The most obvious benefit of this no-nonsense policy is that parents will no longer have to rely on time-consuming administrative and political maneuvering to see a force for change effected in their children's schools.   AWE-INSPIRING INITIATIVES   Indicating how such a scenario might play out, and taking full cognizance of the utility of the expanding SUT fleet, a Pentagon press release — the first of its kind to outline new education policies — states that, "when the academic condition of the school is deemed deficient, the school shall be surrounded by SUTs operated by local citizens, and the faculty and students shall be forced off school grounds and reassigned pursuant to local Board policy and procedure. Furthermore, upon destruction by fire power, the failing school shall remain under control of the Board, and no child shall be left behind in the smoldering remains." Schools lacking grant money and startup funding for No Child Left Behind have already been put on notice. Asked to comment on whether he backs this new commitment to jump-starting education through public-assisted, results-oriented enforcement, the Secretary of Defense, Ronald McDumsfeld, remarked that,      "I guess the way to respond to that is that there is no doubt but that there are gains to be hoped for. Whether it's today, tomorrow, a year from now, two years from now, or more, what we know is that this allows us ways of doing and thinking whose value as we go forward is without question. Needless to say, everyone's hopeful that the state of our schools, which tends to ebb and flow, will stay above a certain threshold and that there's -- did I say we have plans? -- no, we have no definite plans. By that I don't mean that we have no plans whatsoever. There are plans that one has and plans that one doesn't have. But there are also plans whose planning may exist but on which action has not been taken. Obviously, we have plans to do everything in the world that we can think of. But there is no doubt but that we do not have any intention at the present time, or no reason to believe, that any of the thinking that goes into these things day in and day out would have to be utilized."    The Secretary of Defense vigorously denied, however, rumors that the Pentagon was planning to use the threat of the recently developed 21,000-pound MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air-burst Bomb, popularly known as the "Mother of all bombs") to intimidate specific schools or educators into obtaining higher test scores for their students. As Secretary McDumsfeld explained, the initial idea was simply to drop one such bomb, whose plume of smoke rises 10,000 feet into the air and is visible at a distance of 40 miles, as a celebratory gesture that would inaugurate the academic year nationwide and inspire students with shock and awe at the mightiness of the nation's pre-eminent power. It is doubtless that such a spectacle would both reassure and motivate today's terror-stricken students. And this, of course, in addition to the reassurance they feel as they slip into the suburban comforts of their SUTs and roll safely from home to school, and back again, to the lulling hum of wheel-driven tracks.

       urlLink The New York Times > Arts > Frank Rich: Michael Moore's Candid Camera   Frank Rich has written a detailed review of Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  that contrasts with many non-reviews that have been appearing in the press the last few days. (The above link may require registration, which is a simple matter; and for the time being this article also appears free-of-registration  urlLink here .) There are too many non-reviews for me to provide links, but they are distinguished by two features. First, they use the word "propaganda" to describe Moore's film. Second, they show no sign that the author of the article has actually seen the film. Call me silly, but it seems to me that writing lengthy "reviews" of films that one has yet to see is the sort of thing only a writer of propaganda would willfully do. (Here is  urlLink one example  of such a dogmatic non-review.)   From Rich's  New York Times  article, I take the closing lines: "No one would ever accuse Michael Moore of having a beautiful mind. Subtleties and fine distinctions are not his thing. That matters very little, it turns out, when you have a story this ugly and this powerful to tell."

       This is one of a series of occasional posts dealing with the notion of forgiveness. Its prevalence in contemporary French philosophy is what drew my attention to it.  Anyone who follow presidential politics is reminded every four years or so of the uneasy heritage of forgiveness. This happens when the president proceeds to grant "pardons" to convicts of various stripes, many of whom are powerful individuals on behalf of whom the president's pardon is beseeched by various associates and, in some cases, lawyers and prominent politicians. Extenuating circumstances, reparations, public manifestation of repentance, improved behavior: every possible excuse is assembled to persuade the one sovereign decision-maker that the normal course of criminal and punitive justice should be suspended. What invariably happens is that the presidential privilege to grant pardons which, as law, does nothing less than to disrupt law itself, brings a chorus of scorn and outrage upon the president, and not only from opposing party members. The absurdity of this situation is only heightened by its predictability.   Recall, for instance, the intense debate that erupted when it was announced that President Clinton had pardoned the so-called commodities trader Marc Rich, a man convicted for tax evasion, fraud and conspiracy, racketeering and illegally trading with Iran--a man who had for twenty years lived in Europe beyond the pale of U.S. prosecutors. Indeed, this debate lives on as part of Clinton's "legacy," as can be seen in a recent Air America Radio satirical skit that grants Clinton a "profile in courage" for his having pardoned Rich.   This assault on the president's pardons is odd if one considers that, according to Article II of the U.S. Constitution, the president "shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment." Thus, the pardon can apply to any crime other than that for which a president would have been impeached; moreover, it insists upon no pre-conditions such as the innocence of the one accused or excusability of the offense. A sweeping power, indeed, its application is not even subjected to judicial review (which becomes another habitual point for which the president is attacked). Indeed, the president need not consult anyone in deciding which pardons to grant (although the number of pardon requests alone normally requires the president seek counsel in decision-making). In this, the president is not asked to do a judge's or jury's job better; rather, the president is given the power to interrupt all legal pursuits with respect to charges already laid or upheld in a court of law. Like forgiveness, which nonetheless remains distinct from this political power, the presidential pardon is in one sense foreign to legal or juridical sovereignty. (In another sense, it is upheld by the legal sovereignty it contravenes.) Thus, clearly, President Clinton, as others before him, only acted in accordance with the Constitution. In the last three years, there have been many executive decisions that were far from being as clearly constitutional as Clinton's pardon of Rich was, yet the issue of pardons seems like few others to stigmatize the presidency.   The arguments were long and bitter over whether Marc Rich deserved to be pardoned. The curiously elementary fact that is always lost in such debates, however, is that not only was the President acting in accordance with the Constitution but, properly speaking, no one ever  deserves  to be pardoned or, for that matter, forgiven. If forgiveness, or a pardon, could be earned by the excusability of the offense, then one could simply declare the charges null and void (in a situation the French call a " non-lieu "). In such cases, there was perhaps a misunderstanding, a freak act committed out-of-character, a matter of confusion or misinformation, an act now of mere historical importance, but nothing as serious as to call for forgiveness or a presidential pardon.   President Clinton only fueled criticism of his action by trying to defend his pardon of Marc Rich. (Clinton listed a number of distinct  urlLink reasons for this one pardon .) Indeed, he seemed at a total loss to understand the notion of presidential pardon. On the day after he had granted 140 pardons,  urlLink Clinton said : "The word 'pardon' is somehow almost a misnomer... You're not saying these people didn't commit the offense. You're saying they paid, they paid in full."    A CONFLICTING HERITAGE  The point here is that the ambiguity that leads to this sort of confusion and rancor every four years on the American political stage is planted within the heritage of the language of forgiveness. In this heritage, which at the very least begins with the Hebraic traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, one finds competing and contradictory demands.   On the one hand, the demand that one forgive only when the one at fault has  asked  for forgiveness, repented, healed, etc. The question that haunts this conditional logic is whether, in having changed in such a way, the candidate for forgiveness is entirely the same as the one who did the misdeed, and whether, therefore, the act of forgiveness is indeed necessary, and, if it is necessary, whether it even hits its mark.   The other demand is that one forgive without first setting conditions; that is, in the absence of repetance, and without assurance or even hope that the misdeed be committed again. In this sense, the presidential pardon, while it is distinct from "forgiveness," seems to descend from the unconditional logic that is part of its heritage. Not only is this second, unconditional logic, difficult to assume, since it might require me to, for instance, forgive one who I know will swiftly proceed to kill me, it is itself rendered problematic by the very assertion of power that it implies. That is, in forgiving unconditionally, I nonetheless presume a certain sovereignty over the one whom I would forgive, which is to say, I presume the power to punish, which my act of forgiving suspends. The question, then, is whether in having such a power at my disposal, I have not already compromised unconditional forgiveness with the condition of my own supremacy. In this sense, unconditional forgiveness cannot escape from being haunted by the plague of ulterior motives that are common to the first logic, not the least of which is that of satisfying my own conscience by thinking of myself as forgiving. To pardon in the presidential sense especially when the pardon is not deserved, as every president most certainly does in pardoning convicts, certainly heightens the power of the executive office, whether or not the president feels elevated by his or her actions.   It is a curious situation when a presidential power guaranteed by the Constitution is apparently understood by neither the president nor by those who regularly criticize its use. We cannot expect President Bush to have any greater command of this notion than to recognize in it an executive privilege, but it's worth interrogating, before Bush proceeds to grant pardons en masse (assuming he will), both the etymology of the word and, to a degree, the (massive) history of the corresponding notion, so as to grasp the complicated overlapping of logics within the heritage of the language of forgiveness and pardon.  I thought would get closer to doing that today. The political context-building got in the way. I will pick up the discussion in a future post by returning to my reading of Alain Gouhier's thesis concerning the origin of "pardon" in Latin and the Romance languages in particular.

       This is one of a series of occasional posts dealing with the notion of forgiveness. Its prevalence in contemporary French philosophy is what drew my attention to it.  This is a non-religious post. I don't say that out of self-defense, nor as an implicit call for the reader's forgiveness. It's just that the topic—-forgiveness—-is not as religious as you might think. I say this not only because the word is often dropped in political discourse and flashed about for all manner of devious and hypocritical motives, but also because, in looking into the history of the word, I discovered in an out-of-print French doctoral dissertation published in 1969 that, before Christianity got its grips on it, the word was already in currency in spoken Latin and—-this is the rub—-had nothing to do with God.   Christian doctrine claims that only God can forgive profoundly, that is, absolutely; while humans, who are by nature sinful, can at best forgive each other for expedient and selfish reasons—-which is to say, they can't truly forgive one another—-and must therefore appeal to God for uncorrupt forgiveness.  Uncorrupt : this doesn't mean "effective" or even perceptible but, rather, that which is in keeping with the purity of the concept. This is how Christianity explains the "for-" in forgiveness, or the "par-" in pardon, which synonymous prefixes are commonly understood as intensifying a type of giving or " don " [which means "gift," as in  don ation], thus making it an absolute gift, one that is all-powerful and pure, one that is given in the absence of repentance, outside any economy of exchange, and without therapeutic, self-serving, or pragmatic aims of any sort. Indeed, a gift that is given without any aim at all, or at least not any aim that one could submit to the dictates of reason, or identify in language. In the prefix of forgiveness lurks the purity and power of the Christian God. By means of this assumption, Christian doctrine is grafted onto the widely-accepted etymology of the prefix which is thereby given theological import.   As Alain Gouhier explains in his untranslated work  Towards a Metaphysics of Forgiveness  [ Pour une métaphysique du pardon , Editions de l’Epi, Paris: 1969], the sense of "giving absolutely" that is apparent in "forgiving" predates the Christian evocation of the word. Thus, not only was a non-theological sense of forgiveness in currency before Biblical translators employed the word, but this non-theological sense already contains within it the hyperbolic or superlative sense of giving that forgiving is granted in Christianity and other Abrahamic traditions. This is easily seen in the evolution from certain Latin words that build progressively on the verb to give [ dare ] to the present-day French words for forgiveness:  le pardon  [noun] or  pardonner  [verb].   Gouhier's analysis suggests that  perdonare  emerges first in juridical, political, ecclesiastical, and in what today would be called literary language. In short, in its earliest uses,  perdonare  never has God as its subject. How, then, did it first emerge? Gouhier argues that the prefix "par-" of pardon is linked to  donare  in Medieval Latin texts only after a series of historical, etymological moments that can be retraced, beginning in Classical Latin, where " donare " and " condonare " are adjoined to the simple verb " dare ," whose formula " veniam dare " already involves remission or indulgence.   According to Gouhier,  donare  first means according a favor: privileges, land, etc. In time, in can be used in instances where what one gives is an indulgence or remission of some sort. If, in this second sort of "favor" I give what another owes me—a debt—I give that which the other should have "given" me. I end up giving the other that which I would have in some sense taken by means of privation or punishment. The deserved punishment is given back, given over, or given up. It then follows that the absence of punishment, as a gift, will be applied to the misdeed itself or to the offender, and no longer merely to the deserved punishment. Thus, I not only give to the other an absence of punishment, I also no longer require that the other respond in any way to their misdeed, that they confess or expiate or atone for it. In this way, with the loss of a precise reference to that which is due, a limitless number of possible designations appear (with, as I've explained, Christianity siezing upon this opportunity to glorify  God's  forgiveness). Gouhier concludes by stating that this "explains the linguistic victory of the prefix ' per -,' an 'augmenting' or 'intensifying' prefix that means 'completely' or 'absolutely.' An infinite offense, an infinite debt, and an infinite gift [ don ], and, thus, forgiveness [ pardon ]"(34-35).   This will sound like I am closing a lecture or, worse, a sermon; but, barring another Bush bicycle accident or like misadventure, I'll next discuss the precise moment at which " le pardon " enters written language, according to Gouhier (which claim is supported by historical dictionaries).

      The fact that Moore's film  urlLink won top honors today   ( La palme d'or ) at Cannes, where, incidentally, "the jury of nine included four Americans, while France was represented solely by actress Emmanuelle Béart," should help it to break through the corporate censorship that is now common in the United States. Not even Bush's influence on the  urlLink Federal Communications Commission , most significantly in the form of his appointee,  urlLink Colin Powell 's pro-corporate monopoly son, chairman Michael Powell, will do him much good when, at this point, action to ban an internationally recognized film could only bring it greater attention.  Assessing the film's reception in the United States should be an excellent means of judging the quality of the press generally, and, in the weeks following its release in the States, I intend to make just such an assessment. Already, Steven Weiss has written on the corporate squabble over the release of this film in the U.S. as a case that reveals the extent to which  urlLink election-year politics can seemingly weigh on the decisions of a major political donor .  Ryan Parry from the Daily Mirror lists  urlLink 10 reasons why Bush would like to ban Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  . Judging from others' accounts of the movie, Bush may have, in fact, 100 or more reasons to want to see this film banned.   Moore was asked by someone at Cannes how he felt Bush would react to seeing the film himself, and he replied, "I hope nobody tells him I've won this award while he's eating a pretzel." (The President fainted in 2002 after choking on a pretzel while watching a football game alone.) Curiously, on the same day that Moore received his award, the president, putting his presidential duties first as he always does, was on a 17-mile bike ride during which  urlLink he fell off his bike  and cut his face and hands and hurt his knees. I try never to lend credence to superstitious thoughts, but I wonder if Bush fell from his bike at the very moment the award to Moore was announced...

       urlLink      Bikes gather in Osaka, Japan&nbsp;  urlLink         urlLink  Banished Bicycles: China's Car Culture Hits Some Potholes    This report caught my attention when it first came out and sent me into a fit of perplexity and anger for a good fortnight. Feeling quite powerless to effect significant change in the death of bike culture in China or elsewhere, I emerged from my fit only by selling what I believe will have been my last automobile, and most certainly my last fossil-fuel powered automobile. But this issue still nags me, since I realize that my personal resistance to "car think" is only a drop in a sea that is crying out for a sea-change.   In the report, we read that "bicycles have gone from carrying more than 70 percent of travelers in Shanghai as recently as 1990 to from 15 to 17 percent now." Can you imagine? Within the space of only 13 years, there was a drop from 70 to as little as 15 percent of bicycle traffic, while the population grew. It is almost as if a bike-specific bomb had been dropped on the city, and materials for making new bikes had run into short supply (while, curiously, materials for making cars were pulled from the four corners of the earth). What is happening in China is very troublesome. Shanghai was, broadly speaking, a perfectly functioning city in 1990. So, the shift to car traffic clearly responded less to a city's needs than to consumers' desires. Apparently, bikes are associated in the minds of Chinese today with "old China" or "rural China," much like cigarettes are arbitrarily (and idiotically) associated with "Western style," "youth" and "fashionability" throughout much of Asia thanks, in both cases, to marketing-driven, corporate distortions. This enormous drop in the number of bicycles in Shanghai, the article also says, is typical of all major Chinese cities. This means that, at a time when the remaining sources of oil in the world have begun to see their twilight on the horizon and alternative sources of power are known to be inevitable, Chinese citizens are swiftly following Americans in allowing "car think" to dominate their lives, their city planning, their laws, their economies, and, most problematically, the natural environment. On that level, the struggle against "car think" is one that would require diminishing the massive status that is accorded cars and car ownership. In the light of struggles against addictive and public tobacco use, one can see just how difficult such a struggle would be; however, unlike the anti-smoking movement, the effort to undermine "car think" has a positive route to take: the valorization of bicycles. It can thus avoid antogonizing car lovers by stressing the positive alternatives of bicycle use in particular.   Incidentally, the French have a wonderful expression for what I just called "car think."  Le tout voiture  refers to the idea that everyday life can and should be managed in and by one's car, as well as the policies that support this presumption. The fact that there is a name for this stupidity suggests that, at least in Europe,   urlLink  resistance to it has been organized   . European cities have for several years held "no car" days in which citizens are encouraged to leave their cars at home, or drive only to the city outskirts, and seek alternate forms of transportation which the cities bolster for the occasion.   Car culture has long dominated the United States, where bike riders in many cities and along many roads are assumed to be participating in exceptional, risky, or deviant behavior (if you don't believe that statement and you are not a biker, take it on word from me that regular biking in many places in the United States often exposes one to all manner of jeering, taunts, and shouts from self-inflated car passengers who spontaneously look down on any pedestrian or bike peddler as being vulnerable).   urlLink  Asphalt Nation   , an excellent book by Jane Holtz Kay, chronicles, along with eloquent photographs, the total dominance of social life and landscapse in America by automobiles. There is also a remarkable PBS report narrated by   urlLink  Ray Suarez    that discussed how, at the end of World War II, General Motors purchased from the City of New York perfectly serviceable and well-running tram cars only to uproot them all so as to increase public dependence on private car ownership. So much for the  necessity  of cars in American cities. (If anyone knows how to find this documentary on this PBS-produced history of New York City, please tell me.)   Given the corporate hold on Washington, the national brain-lock in "car think" is not likely to loosen anytime soon. Despite all their likely benefits to public health and safety, policies that encourage biycling are so far off the political radar screen that we are more likely to see astronauts riding bikes on Mars before we see bicycles in large numbers in our towns and cities. Corporate America simply has not been able to find a way to soak as much profit out of bicycle manufacturing as it has out of car manufacturing and car insurance, space travel, and war (to name the most famous areas of government knee-buckling at the corporate behest).   The photograph that appears above was taken in Osaka, Japan in 2004. Japan presumably also had a thriving bicycle culture at one point, much like China, and relative to the United States, it certainly still does. I think this photograph suggests that bike culture in Japan is still holding its own. In your mind, turn each one of these bikes into a car. Imagine it is the size of an S.U.V. With that image in mind, you can see how the asphalt pictured within this photo would quickly disappear from sight under the cars' bloated presence. The cars would bulge out like a fleet of rescue vehicles parked haphazardly around a scene of distress. To be cleared from the road, they would require a parking garage, which would perhaps require a separate building, or a parking lot, which would steal room for a home or park and further congest the conditions of life for the city's inhabitants. With such thoughts in mind, think how sane is the simplicity of bikes.   Parked before an apartment building, these bikes butt into the street with confidence, covering almost half the distance of one lane. This arrangement is not uncommon in Osaka. Moreover, they are parked in defiance of "no parking" signs that sit before the apartment building (prohibiting cars AND bikes from being parked there). This reminds us of the somewhat ambiguous status of bicycles and the fact that they are given more slack in the eyes of the law. As far as I know, in the laws of most nations, they are deemed moving vehicles on par with automobiles; quite often, however, despite their legal status, they are treated with the permissiveness granted a pedestrian who crosses underneath a red light when no traffic is coming or never stops at stop signs. Few ever pay insurance on their bikes, and bikes are almost never tagged with fines to fill a city's coffers. They can be ridden on streets or sidewalks and allowed to meander among parked or idling cars as if they were evanescent, a mere fluid or vapor coursing through interstices. They can be carried in and out of buildings like sleeping children and hung from storage hooks like heavy overcoats.   Perhaps it is in the very flexibility, simplicity, and efficiency of bikes that lies their subversiveness in the eyes of corporate-driven law-makers the world over.

      It is a painful thing to contemplate the  urlLink ignorant ,  urlLink arrogant  language that is often spoken by Republican members of the Congress. This was particularly true with respect to comments made by the Republican leadership in the Congress regarding the Spanish elections at the beginning of the year. The ‘with-us-or-against-us’ mentality led some to charge the Spanish (citizens or new government) with appeasing terrorists (Dennis Hastert) and permitting “the victory of the terrorists” (Tom DeLay). I recall that Presidents Carter and Clinton, and many other American political leaders after them, refused to pronounce upon elections abroad, saying that it was not their place to do so. Has this understanding of propriety disappeared from political culture in the United States for some reason? If so, why? And who asked the Republican leadership in the Congress for their opinion of Spanish voters?  The main presumption of the Republican's charges is that Zapatero was elected out of cowering thoughtlessness in the face of a single act of barbarity. As such, the charges not only insult Zapatero and his supporters, since they imply that there could be no other reason to vote for him, they also dismiss the long-held, massive resistance among Spanish voters to their nation’s participation in a war that has led to well over 10,000 civilian deaths (the comprehensive investigation into which killings was deemed by the U.S. military, in contravention to one of four  urlLink Geneva Conventions , to be beneath their scope of competence or responsibility). Further, they brush aside the fact that Spanish voters felt compelled to change their government not out of cowardice but because their government had purposefully deceived them by squelching intelligence linking the bombings to Islamic militants.   The second baseless assumption animating these charges is that in destroying the criminal and enfeebled regime of Saddam Hussein, U.S.-led forces have struck a blow to "terrorism." Repeating claims that, for instance, Hussein was “sitting atop a nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons program, a ticking time bomb, a nuclear 9-11 waiting to happen” ( urlLink DeLay, March 17, 2004 ), is a fear-mongering, deceitful tactic. At the very least, lawmakers who repeat such lies should be censored.   One could list many effective ways to fight terrorism. The speedy progress that the Spanish have made in investigating the train bombings suggests that investigative action has merit. (It's not surprising that in the American press the Spanish have not been praised for their success in this investigation, which investigation truly puts to shame all of the ridiculously violent, flashy, illegal, deceptive, counter-productive, and expensive means of "fighting terrorism" employed by the Bush administration till this point.) In any case, insulting democratic elections, scaring citizens by repeating false claims, shocking people with brute force, shredding international law, trashing basic human rights, and killing thousands of innocent people, cannot possibly rank high on the list of efficient ways of countering terrorism. And yet these are precisely the means by which our "leadership" in the Congress, Pentagon, and White House have sought to "protect" the American people.  In its condemnation of the Spanish voters, the Republican-led Congress has likely alienated yet another important ally and, in the process, insulted democracy itself. It would be foolish not to see in their fat-mouthed commentary on the Spanish voters an attempt to protect their own campaign of deception and fear-mongering from a vigilant public. It is thus time for American voters to follow the Spanish example and put their own power of democracy to work by voting for leaders who know how to fight terrorism honestly and intelligently.

       The following is of one of a series of posts at Terrette on Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  Genre categories in film are lagging seriously behind film innovations. Michael Moore is far from being the first to meld the presumably distinct genres of documentary film and fiction (not to mention, autobiography). Agnès Varda's  The Gleaners and I  (2000) is another example of what could be called a "fictimentary." It begins as an investigation in art history, history, and contemporary society of a single gesture—picking something up from the ground in an effort to salvage something of unappreciated value—and expands into an exploration of the lives of underprivileged and resourceful citizens of contemporary France. We should recognize that, according to the written  urlLink accounts of Moore's latest film  and in keeping with Moore's previous work,  Fahrenheit 9/11  is neither a strict documentary nor an idiosyncratic fiction of pure fantasy. Before its release, we should be cautious of the two extremes of criticism that are likely to greet it (as discussed in pt. 1, below).  Yesterday, I wrote that Moore's films contain "mythologizing." By this, I mean, for example, Moore's treatment of his hometown, Flint, Michigan. Moore regularly returns to Flint in his films, but he certainly has never made a documentary of Flint.  Roger and Me  offers historical information and takes places largely in Flint, but the film focuses on Flint because Flint reflects the larger issue of corporate evolution in the United States generally. Flint in this movie, in particular, assumes the metonymic role of blue-collar American. This is not to say that Moore falsifies the history or experience of people living in Flint, Michigan in order to force a pre-conceived idea onto them, but only that, on the basis of certain facts of the social and economic situation of Flint, Moore draws out patterns in their experiences that exist elsewhere in America and thus resonate among viewers from all over the country.    Bowling for Columbine , for its part, is no more a documentary of violence in the United States than Hugo's novel  Les Misérables  is a documentary of La Commune or political strife in 1840's Paris.  Bowling for Columbine  does not use the topic of violence in the United States simply as a backdrop for a story of human passions, and it cites figures for gun ownership and levels of gun violence in different nations; but it offers more questions than it does answers, and the answers it does offer come not from the filmmaker himself, but from the contradictory voices of those interviewed.   What most pulls Moore's films out of the category of "documentaries" is that they appeal primarily to the human dimension of the events they narrate. There is nothing particularly "left wing" or propagandistic about exposing the human suffering caused by corporate indifference or gun violence in the United States. For the same reason, it is difficult to imagine a similarly hybrid film made from the political right. What human suffering is there to be found in, for instance, the thought that a prospective billionaire might have to pay an inheritance tax before inheriting her wealth? What human intrigue capable of moving the masses could be displayed in the story of a multinational corporation that is denied a monopoly of a given industry? Could it move audiences to witness the story of a Fortune 500 corporation that, after many years of paying no taxes, is obliged to pay some? The only way I could conceive of such a film is if it were a pure satire: but, in that case, who better to make it than Michael Moore?   Let's try to forecast the type of criticism that will come from the American political right if Moore's film is honored at Cannes and attracts real attention in the States. I would guess that not only will Moore be called unpatriotic and un-American, but that we may even hear members of Congress and radio talk-show hate mongers such as Rush Limbaugh expand their criticism of the film to include the Cannes Film Festival, Hollywood, the French, Western Europeans, the "media," and who-knows-whom-or-what-else. It may even be called "a victory for terrorism." I say this because of what I witnessed after the Spanish elections that ousted a pro-Bush government largely because that government had deceived the Spanish voters. Once the anti-war socialist party was announced the winner, a hideously anti-democratic and self-inflated discourse spewed from the Republican Congressional leadership, and this contemptuous discourse was echoed thoughtlessly throughout the editorials of the nation's major newspapers (see tomorrow's post for more on this topic).   Whether or not this hyperbolic scenario of political hate speech comes to pass, we should be cautious of those would judge  Fahrenheit 9/11  on purely political grounds without respect for its being a film designed primarily to entertain the public and raise questions. As for the question of whether the film bleeds into propaganda, as some have charged (I think, unfairly) of Moore's previous work, that is one we cannot address before seeing the film.

       The following is one of a series of posts at Terrette on Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  As we wait in anticipation for  urlLink Michael Moore 's  Fahrenheit 9/11  to find a distributor in the U.S., it is worth noting, before the onslaught of movie reviews have their way with it, that this film is likely to be met with the same critical incomprehension that has often greeted Moore’s previous films. This incomprehension is due, I think, to a confusion concerning the nature of the films, which are neither documentaries in any strict sense of the word nor works of pure fiction.   Critics who railed against  Roger and Me  because of potential, minor factual inaccuracies (such as the question of whether Roger Smith really ever dined in that restaurant where Moore had gone to look for him) or  Bowling for Columbine  because Moore had not consulted criminologists or sociologists, both start from the same false assumption that Moore is a documentary filmmaker. Such critics are encouraged in this both by Moore’s  Bowling for Columbine  having been designated a "documentary" in various awards ceremonies and by Moore's own use of the term to qualify the film. It is no wonder that  Bowling for Columbine  was the first "documentary" to win an Oscar, because, well, it isn't one! At the same time, while not being documentaries, Moore's films are not fictions in the sense in which, for instance, Charles Perrault's fairy tales or any classic novel or Walt Disney production are fictions. In an effort to both distill, and question, the crux of contemporary life, they dig into recent events and collect narratives surrounding shared, traumatic experiences.   In a word, Moore's films participate in elements both of documentaries (interviews, the presentation of statistics, the framing of a problem or issue)  and  fictions (humor, irony, mythologizing). For this reason, perhaps they would best be called "fictimentaries."   In calling them so, one should not confuse different senses of the word "fiction." Moore's films are not fictions in the way that, say,  urlLink Bush campaign ads are fictions  or  urlLink videos the Bush administration has made to promote the new Medicare law are illegal propaganda . They are not designed to deceive. Often, those from the political Right who claim that the films are "loaded" and "propagandistic" simply dismiss out-of-hand the very obvious fact that the films are primarily a form of entertainment. Such critics are motivated to contest the political and cultural perspectives of the films and so unjustifiably treat them as if they were political treatises. Thus, they dismiss their entertainment value. Moore frequently points out (as if it were necessary) that his main goal is setting out to make a film is not to ram home a political agenda (which goal would kill the entertainment value of the project) but rather to entertain. It is Moore's particular strength that he manages to do this consistently while imbuing his films with social consciousness and humanity. The fact that Moore's films have sold well attests to the fact not only that there are a lot of left-wing people in the world but also, more importantly, that people enjoy watching the films. They appeal to the viewer as any classic work of fiction appeals to its audience: by entertaining.     Forethoughts:    To those who say of Moore's newest film, "Oh, that's just politicizing the war on terrorism," or "that's propaganda," the proper response in all likelihood will be: "Well, if you call that propaganda, what does your idea of an investigative, entertaning 'documentary' look like?" If anyone argues that the film "politicizes" something that is not already political, or that it uses "propagandistic" tactics, the film will still have to be assessed  as a film . And if, as a film, it turns out to be a good show, enjoyed by many, well, that will speak volumes for the film as a film and put the narrowly political criticisms of it in their place.   To those, however, who say, "It wasn't fully documented: it didn't consult all the specialists or treat the issues exhaustively," the answer will most likely be: "So, what? It wasn't meant to." Such viewers would be better off watching documentaries that they may have the fortune to find in their local libraries.

        urlLink The Australian: Bill Kauffman: An underdog may be the best antidote to neo-cons [May 18, 2004]   Kauffman's is the sort of article that could not be written by anyone caught up in the current climate of polarized political anxiety that reigns in the United States. On the one hand, we have the Neo-cons saying that either Americans vote George Bush into the office he currently holds, or they will lose the war on terror and forever live in a terror-ravaged world; on the other hand, the Democrats and anybody-but-Bush partisans claim that either Americans vote for Kerry and support him in everything he does and says, or they will be faced with at least four more years of unmitigated international terrorism and national fiscal and cultural turmoil at the hands of Bush, Inc. While the second of these two either/or scenarios has at least some substance to it (whereas the first should force just about any stable-minded individual to fall from their chair in a bout of incontrollable laughter), the second scenario is no more justified, in the end, and its consequences are pernicious. The scenario is not as pernicious in its consequences as would be that of Cheney and Rumsfeld and the rest of their corporate militarists running policy in the U.S. and abroad for another four years, but it is pernicious in so far as it is being used to steal from citizens the process of debate that is crucial to keeping a democracy vital (or, rather, of restoring some measure of democratic vitality to what is currently, on the whole, a culture of polarized thoughtlessness). An Either/Or climate gives a free pass to candidates and discourages political accountability.  Kerry deserves support simply on the grounds that he is running against Bush. Anyone who is not i) an irresponsible millionaire or billionaire, ii) a fossil fuel or weapons investor, or iii) a sadly duped citizen who believes that voting for Bush will serve her own interests, can easily accept that Kerry is preferable to Bush simply for not being Bush. Nonetheless, it is the responsibility of citizens who support Kerry to demonstrate that they have not severed their critical capacities out of a blind anti-Bush rage and that they still keep major issues and stakes in focus. Kerry has an impressive record of voting to support progressive causes for many years. But there are several issues on which his silence, or his vocal backing of Bush, are cause for concern. For instance, his silence on the camp of international lawlessness, thuggery, and bullying known as Guantanamo is troubling, to say the least. Even Kerry's wife has clearly stated that the detainees in that camp should be classified as prisoners of war and not be given the bogus denomination of "lawless combatants" (which is just a stupid formulation for "really, really evil S.O.B. that we intend to humiliate, even in the absence of evidence"). Holding Kerry's hand to the fire on this one issue, for instance, does not mean that voters have to begin looking for a single positive thing in the horrific presidency of George Bush (a vain enterprise, if ever), nor that they have to consider withdrawing their vote for Kerry and placing it with another candidate. What it means, simply, is that they have to challenge their own candidate and show him that their votes contribute to building him a mandate that amounts to more than just, "We want you to be somebody other than George Bush."   In the either/or climate that reigns in the United States these days, it is not surprising that it apparently took an Australian to point out all the positive aspects of Ralph Nader's candidacy without blushing in shame or swearing that he (the author) is not, in fact, a clandestine Bush sympathizer. It is a sign of the times that the syndicated "liberal"  urlLink radio program  that debuted many weeks ago invited Nader to speak only to shout him down ruthlessly, and now refuses to speak about his platorm or activities, or even to mention his name. (And just how "liberal" is  that , America?) What Kauffman pulls off in his article, in a way that Air America Radio would never tolerate, is to show how Nader takes positive aspects of both conservative and liberal perspectives and melds them into a coherent, uncompromised vision of anti-corporate, anti-corporate-war leadership.   Nader speaks in an uncomprised manner to power in a way that Kerry supporters only wish their candidate would. Kerry's not doing so, his supporters hope, is only a strategic quietness, a deliberate attempt to wait for the right moment to strike or for the point beyond which Bush's own self-damage can no longer be mended. Although these explanations beg the question of what sort of leader Kerry is, the hopes that Kerry is only holding his cards may, in fact, prove to be well-founded, and there is no sound reason for hoping against them. As Nader himself said of Kerry, he is a "work in progress" and his voting record, as well as the verbal support he has shown progressive causes, especially in the fashion of Dean and Edwards, can itself auger good things. Lip service, said Nader, is sometimes the first step to reform. Until Kerry can actually turn this corner, however, Nader will remain the best antidote to the Neo-cons and not be (as he is contemptuously referred to in most circles) a mere "spoiler." This much is certain: in order not to inherit and thus perpetuate much of the distortions to national and international law that the Neo-cons have imposed upon us in the last three years, Kerry, as president, would have to be extremely vocal and active for a long time in overturning Bush-signed legislation and Bush-supported policy.   Kerry's beating Bush will without a doubt be cause for unbridled celebration. But once the party is over (if that party ever happens), we will wake up to a day in which the legacy of Bush remains with us. Let us hope that those who are intent on voting for anybody-but-Bush help to select a candidate that has the staying power not to become Bush by inheritance. The U.S. needs a radical shift in its foreign and domestic policy, and such a radical shift cannot be obtained by anyone who refuses, for instance, to call Guantanamo a dungeon of lawlessness.   Let me cite an exchange in which Kerry is asked to speak about Guantanamo and replies in abstract and uncommitted language. It is the only known place where I have seen Kerry quoted on Guantanamo, and it comes from Kerry's own website:    Q:   What is your opinion on the detentions at Guantanamo, and what would you do about the prisoners being held there if you are elected?    Kerry:   I am deeply concerned that the Bush Administration has thrown basic civil liberties out the window in their efforts to make Americans feel safer, while doing little to actually make them safer. I do not trust John Ashcroft to protect our civil liberties.  (I would appreciate if anyone could locate other Kerry statements on Guantanamo that may exist.)  The point of this post is not to perpetuate the idiotic Republican-constructed myth of "Kerry, the flip-flopper," or to attack Kerry on character grounds by saying that he is too soft, not bitter or loud enough, etc. The former myth has been  urlLink demolished , and while Kerry has been curiously silent on Guantanamo for all we can tell, as  urlLink Diogenes  has pointed out to me, he has made strong  urlLink statements  concerning the abuses of detained citizens at Abu Ghraib, and even has stated that responsibility for the abuse of prisoners  urlLink extends to the Oval Office .  The point of this post, rather, is to suggest that it is much too early to "close ranks" against Bush if by that we mean closing our minds. To me, Guantanamo stands as the Bush administration's most egregious example of contempt for international law and its corresponding cult of executive sovereignty. It would be odd, indeed, for Kerry to step into Bush's shoes as the 'Sovereign of Guantanamo' who holds the destiny of potentially any U.S. or world citizen in his clutches, especially when John Kerry, for many, is Mr. Anbody-but-Bush.

       To listen to  On the Media , click on the Terrette link to it.  On the Media, which can be heard on a number of NPR stations and  urlLink accessed online , is a source of commentary on events relating to world media. It has followed closely the increased concentration in fewer and fewer hands the spectrum of media in the U.S. and its increasingly pro-war, right-wing, corporate nature. It came as a real surprise to me, then, that in their report " urlLink Enemy Jazeera ?," On the Media does what cable or corporate news almost always does for its U.S. consumers, namely, give only the point of view of the current U.S. administration and present it largely uncritically. In this segment, On the Media interviews the director of strategic communications at the Coalition Provisional Authority, who complains about Al-Jazeera and goes as far as to lie in his counter charges (in particular, about the U.S. use of cluster bombs). The interviewer, On the Media's Managing Editor Brooke Gladstone, fails to challenge this false claim that the U.S. did not use cluster bombs.  I wrote two separate letters in complaint and present them below. (While neither of these was mentioned in their following program, they did cite a sentence or two from a letter of a listener whose response was similar in tone.)  Before posting the letters, let me point readers interested in On the Media to this compelling,  urlLink general critique  of the program.  [July 6. 2004 update: this last weekend, On the Media reached new depths of corporate-minded mediocrity by bashing Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  with the help of the ideologically driven Newsweek reporter Isikoff (who repeated his false claims) and by giving a defense of the Carlyle group with the help of its recently hired damage-control PR man.]   First letter:  Hello, On the Media e-mail reader,   	I love your show. I had a problem, though, with the piece on Al-Jazeera, for the following reasons:  	1) It didn't allow Al-Jazeera a rebuttal to the charges made with respect to specific cases.    	2) It failed to take advantage of the glaring opportunity to ask Mr. Tappan to apply his 'truth matrix' for journalism to the obviously pro-Bush and often misleading Fox News (or--in what could have been truly interesting--to apply this same test without the consent or intervention of Mr. Tappan). How many misleading statements can Fox News make before representatives of the U.S. government speak against them? And can we possibly believe that lives are not in the balance, as well, in the misrepresentation of events and ideas offered up by Fox News?  	3) It failed to question the basis on which Mr. Tappan or Colin Powell feels they are suited to criticize foreign press. Would either figure be willing to respond to Qatar reviews of U.S. media? Or of the state of public airwave access in the U.S.? If not, then this refusal should be taken into consideration when we weigh the significance of their opinions about televised press abroad.   	4) It left the impression that the U.S. forces have not used cluster bombs (since that is the claim Tappan falsely made). It has been widely  urlLink documented , by USA Today among other mainstream media, that the U.S. Army has used outdated cluster bombs in civilian areas that have had  urlLink devastating effects  on civilian populations.    	Keep up the good work and please apologize for, or at least offer a supplementary report to, this sub-standard piece on Al-Jazeera. If your listeners want a U.S. military view of events in Iraq, they can turn on just about any other form of corporate media. Listeners of On the Media expect more rigor and broad-mindedness.    Second letter:  Dear On the Media:  Your segment "Enemy Jazeera?" was informative in reporting on the U.S.administration's diplomatic intervention in Qatar; however, it seemed to beg a much larger issue, which can be framed as follows:  It is hypocritical for Colin Powell and others representing the Bush administration to reprimand the Qatar government for its support of the public network Al-Jazeera when, in the view of media watchdog groups and observers of many political stripes, the state of the press in the United States is lamentable (and worsening year after year, with fewer and fewer choices, and more and more corporate-driven consent). Those who have access to Al-Jazeera and other channels of news have at their disposal a much wider spectrum of appreciation of the events going on in Iraq in particular than a large majority of citizens in the U.S. This is so whether or not it is true that, as Powell, Robert Tappan, or others contend, aspects of some reports done by Al-Jazeera have been blatantly false.  To see this hypocritical protest-lodging in its proper light, one has only to recall that reports from all the major U.S. networks--in many cases, relayed unfiltered from the White House --concerning "weapons of mass destruction" and "Iraq's posing an immanent threat to the United States"are known to have been blatantly false; nonetheless, Powell has yet to lodge an official complaint about this with either the chief executive, the Congress, or the FCC.  It would have improved your segment had you so framed this issue to Mr. Tappan.  Moreover, it would have been in keeping with the spirit of "On the Media" not simply to relay the administration's view of a given media outlet.

       urlLink     "Withdraw!," say these swollen characters before a symbol of peace. Japanese citizens protest prime minister Koizumi's support for Bush's campaign of misguided military and political aggression in Iraq. These protesters, who belong to a group of researchers who study the effects of depleted uranium on soldiers and civilians, were vastly outnumbered by the prepossessed shoppers that passed them by. Japan has been swept away in a tide of conservatism and political cluelessness, as was amply demonstrated upon the return of Japanese hostages from Iraq in April. The former hostages were subjected to  urlLink near unanimous scorn  by the Japanese public and press (with the exception of the left-leaning  urlLink Asahi Shinbun , whose editors wrote in their favor), and the pro-Bush, war-nostalgic government even forced them to pay monetary compensations for the "disturbances" that their capture and release had caused. It was easy to see in these petty compensation requirements warnings against other Japanese not to complicate with hair-brained humanitarian missions the Japanese government's serious-minded meddling in Iraq. One Japanese woman's complaint (that echoed actual statements from government officials) was typical: "I don't want to pay tax money for taking care of those hostages!" Of course, she had not even asked herself how much tax money is being spent on the "humanitarian" mission currently being conducted by Koizumi's soldier boys, and which mission is undoubtedly motivated by the promise of privileged access to Iraqi oil. In short, the nation has been  urlLink encouraged  to heap scorn on these true humanitarians while the phoney humanitarians with machine guns in their arms pass as national heroes.  To join citizens of the world in protesting this ugly situation, please read and sign, if you will, this  urlLink petition  addressed to Koizumi.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink   One of my intentions in starting this blog was to contribute to a public discourse that will help to oust Bush Inc. from Washington, D.C.. I hope I have succeeded, however faint the impact may have been.  Now, to complete my dissertation and find stable, long-term employment in academia, I need to take a break from blogging. Tenured positions are increasingly scarce and hard to obtain, so the task will require my full atttention.  I want to thank  urlLink Steve Bates ,  urlLink Charles 2 ,  urlLink Lujane ,  urlLink Sofarsogoo ,  urlLink wil ,  urlLink andante ,  urlLink Wanda ,  urlLink Matthea , and the others who have commented here. I still intend to visit and leave comments at your sites, from which I have learned a lot, and have every intention of resuming my own blogging regularly before the end of the year.   May the day come soon when we can all blog our hearts out in glee at the decisive removal of George Bush from our White House. And speaking of Bush, remember when he could not think of a single mistake he had made, when asked the question during a rare press conference? Well, at the very least, he can thank Michael Moore for jogging his--and the public's--memory.   Lastly, if anyone reading this is more or less new to blogging and would like a guide to the world of blogs, I recommend you start with  urlLink Steve Bates' site , which  has an excellent listing of blogs that includes descriptive text boxes for each blog. Just let your cursor hover over the individual blog titles to read the descriptions.   So, till next time, here's holding a hand up to you all in thanks and well-wishing.

       Since  Fahrenheit 9/11   was first discussed, "propaganda" has become the darling word of our truth-seeking media mouths. Virtually everyone loves to call Moore's film "propaganda." Merely pronouncing the word seems to bring satisfaction.   Perhaps saying "propaganda" excites a sense of pride and wonderment at one's own powers of analysis. If we only say "this or that is propaganda," then we swiftly assure ourselves a position of dispassionate objectivity. Some use the word to dismiss Moore's entire film; others, simply to suggest that Moore has a "point of view." The broad spectrum of meaning implied in this practice encounters no obstacle, as no one bothers to define the word, which is carried away in the currents of a whim.    To join the "propaganda" party, I would like to say that one thing that disappointed me about  Fahrenheit 9/11  is that it participates (to a degree) in what seems to me to be the biggest piece of propaganda of the day in the United States, one that is conspicuous by its at once unstated and ubiquitous nature. Specifically (unless I simply overlooked this aspect of the movie),  Fahrenheit 9/11  fails to mention the number of Iraqi civilians who have been killed by U.S. forces. It does  suggest  that children were killed, and even shows the body of  one  of them, but why does it not state a number? My sense is that this is because the number of Iraqis killed must, in accordance with an unquestioned assumption that is a distinguishing feature of American society, remain not only unspoken, but uncalculated. The deaths must remain essentially incalculable and out-of-bounds for civil discourse. U.S. military forces in Iraq even breached a Geneva Convention that dictates that occupying forces must tally civilian deaths because the keeping of such records was deemed "impracticable." No one seems to have noticed this. No one who appears angry about Moore's "propaganda" took the U.S. leadership to task for this breach of an international treaty.   One sequence in particular of  Fahrenheit 9/11  has been repeatedly called "propaganda" for suggesting that children were killed. Moore shows children playing in the streets and follows this shot with images of government buildings in Baghdad being bombed. Right-wing commentators cry foul, saying that "Sadaam's Iraq was not all that peaceful." Moore's answer to this criticism, which is not without its justification, is that popular media have already covered Sadaam's wickedness extensively over the last four years and, with two hours at his disposal, he thought he would draw a different picture. Well, perhaps if people knew the number of Iraqis killed by U.S. cluster bombing, by the use of depleted uranium, and by all other manner of firepower the U.S. forces have used, then these self-righteous commentators would not be so quick to label this sequence "propaganda." As I see it, the sequence merely condenses a fact of the invasion that was repeated a countless number of times throughout the invasion. It is perfectly factual that lots of children played in the streets of Iraq before (and during) the U.S. invasion. It is also perfectly factual that thousands of them were cut down by U.S. firepower and are still dying and suffering horrific health problems as a consequence of the U.S. military actions in their country. So, what is the point in railing against Moore for his "propaganda" in this sequence? Many Americans (%40-%60, by recent estimates) still believe that Iraqis were directly involved in the attacks of 9/11. Can you imagine how many are still in the dark about the number of U.S.-provoked civilian deaths in Iraq and elsewhere? If this street-play-to-bombing sequence is propaganda, it is hardly as decisive as the "official" propaganda it serves to counter. The sequence of images would have been more decisive--and less vulnerable to facile charges of "propaganda," I think, if Moore had cited a figure to support it.  The 'law of silence' that reigns over all these deaths is a piece of mute propaganda that apparently not even Moore feels he can get too close to. In liberty-loving America, the vast majority of our public figures and politicians would find it impossible to invoke these deaths as an argument against U.S. military aggression. It just could not happen. And I wonder, why is this? Why do we all have to act as if the lives of civilians in other parts of the world are negligible to the point of being unspeakable and, as Rumsfeld might say, unknowable?   For anyone who might take an interest in this question, my April 11 post presents links to ongoing research into this question. In November 2003, MEDACT estimated that 20,000 to 55,000 Iraqis had been killed in the U.S. invasion.

       Is anyone not yet convinced that President Bush is losing touch? Do you not yet sense that he is a danger not only to the world, but to civility itself? If so, I encourage you to visit  urlLink Lies.com , which has an excellent write-up on the Bush interview with the Irish reporter that took place a few days ago, including a video link to the complete interview and links to some sharp blogger commentary.  It turns out the White House responded angrily to being asked questions. Democracynow.org has reported that the White House has filed a complaint with the Irish Embassy. Curiously, the questions Bush were asked were scripted; the journalist, Carole Coleman, submitted them to the White House three days in advance. Moreover, they are, I think, the sort of questions that not only the Irish people, but citizens the world over, would wish to ask the President. To measure just how out-of-touch the White House has become, consider that, in addition to lodging a formal complaint, the White House has "retaliated" by canceling a schedule interview with Laura Bush that Coleman had been given permission to conduct. (Apparently, this cancellation order fits in with the "preemptive" strategy of the Bush Administration.)  Intimidating journalists in this manner is, as I illustrated in a recent post ("Clinton's revealing interview"), something for which the Bush Administration can cite the Clinton Administration as a precedent. Bush takes the tendency to new depths of incivility, as he stubbornly pounds out abstract, delusional talking points that bear no substantive information of any kind.   Note, too, how Bush tries to muster presidential fortitude by lavishing questionable adverbs on himself. For example: "I STRONGLY argue that..." You strongly argue? Excuse me? Moreover, the forward-thrusting body movement he makes as he lets this adverbial bomb fly does little to strengthen the STRONGLY argued opinion he refers to.   Here is how I recalled the interview between Ms. Coleman and Bush (in a post written a few days ago).     An Irish reporter asked Bush if he didn't find significance in the fact that so many Irish (15,000 of whom demonstrated on his visit to Ireland) are angry about the torture scandal and about his diverting the war on terror away from Al-Qaeda to Iraq. His response, which I paraphrase here, seemed to confirm the premises of Moore's film. Bush responded by ignoring the comment about Al-Qaeda, as if the diversion of the war away from the actual terrorists responsible for 9/11 were a given and not worth discussing, speaking some platitudes about good Irish-American relations, as if the threat to such relations were not exactly the point of the interviewer's question, and putting all the blame for the torture scandal on the backs of a few soldiers, which tactic only confirms Moore's (and many others') view that the Administration doesn't give a damn about those whom it enlists to do its dirty work (and whose sacrifices it and its supporters use cynically as a shield against criticism of Bush Administration policies).

       Remember how the consulting group called "Move America Forward" last week took comfort in the fact that  Fahrenheit 9/11  was showing in only about 500 theaters nationwide?  Aside from the fact that the actual number is 868, this triumphant claim has been put to shame by the box office report released today that shows  Fahrenheit 9/11  to be the top grossing film this weekend, the first documentary ever to reach number one. Yes, films like "White Chicks" and "Dodgeball" and "Harry Potter #14" are playing in more than three times as many theaters, but are making less money.     Compare   Film title -- no. of theaters -- weekend gross   Fahrenheit 9/11  -- 868 -- $21,800,000  Harry Potter...  -- 3404 -- $11,420,000  Thus, while the bubble-gum films are spaciously received by corporate America, Americans of many stripes are flocking to Moore's latest movie and claiming it as their own.   Here in Buffalo, NY, a strange phenomenon has occurred. Since there is essentially only one theater in town showing the film (although it is playing at two theaters in driving distance), huge crowds have amassed in front of the theater, which has sold nearly 3,000 tickets (full capacity) for the third day in a row. Yesterday, I roller-bladed in a lot across from the theater and, over the course of an hour and a half, saw no slackening of the line. In fact, that line remained there all afternoon, until all the day's three thousand tickets were sold out. It cheered me just to glance over there once in a while and see so many people waiting to get in.   In the interest of balance, I asked one of the ticket takers if he had heard any negative opinions voiced about the film. He told me that the film is roundly applauded every time, but that one guy, who was walking into the only other film showing, namely  Saved , said to him, about  Fahrenheit 9/11 , "Showing that film is treason!" On hearing this, I said to the ticket taker, but didn't that guy realize that seeing  Saved  is sacrilegious?  Not only film goers, but citizen activists have shown up at the theater. You can find Rock the Vote people with their music-blaring pick-up truck parked in the theater lot, passing out voter registration forms. There's a Vietnam Vet member handing out "9/11 dollar bills." And then you have representatives from MoveOn.org and some student groups handing out bumper stickers and such. It's a wonderful atmosphere. Democracy seems to have sprung to life. And the Amherst theater has essentially become the hottest social spot in town!   If you haven't noticed already, Michael Moore has posted many  urlLink accounts like this one  that illustrate the incredible enthusiasm Americans are showing for this film.

       The complexity of Moore's film comes, in part, from the fact that it works on so many levels. Moore opens up his entire tool box and pulls out humor, investigative reporting, historical narrative, irony, emotional appeal, shocking realism, throbbing or seductive musical tracks, and more.  Some reviewers reject this multi-genre approach. As Jeff Simon for the  Buffalo News  wrote of Moore, "Tom Brokaw, he ain't." To this, I say: Thank God Moore ain't Brokaw, because the need NOT TO BE BROKAW or BROKAW-LIKE is one of the major points of the movie. (Besides, who could ever sit through two hours of BROKAW, and who would actually pay for it?) Simon also calls Moore a "slob" and a "bully." These kinds of responses express well the sort of contempt in which the stiffly conventional talking heads of corporate media hold Moore, who simply out-maneuvers them in a multitude of ways and ends up at a point far closer to the truth than they can ever hope to reach. They must despise him for revealing them in their cold, impotent light.   My overriding emotion after seeing  Fahrenheit 9/11  was one of relief. Finally, I thought, someone shares the anger and disbelief that has accompanied me every day of Bush's presidency. And so, I am not simply mad, am I? Whew! I felt tremendously grateful to Moore for channeling this anger into a well-constructed document that many others can see and, yes, enjoy.   On a local note, the Amherst Theater in Buffalo, NY had a record movie turnout, with every seat (of 3,000) being sold out for the day's eight showings. The theater was packed and the audience reacted perceptively to the film's many dimensions. I cried and laughed with everyone else. And, for sure, I got angry with them, too. I doubt that this excitement can be explained only in terms of certain media-propelled controversies. People are starving for a non-corporate-media view of the events of the past three-and-a-half years.   After viewing the film, I returned home to see the pathetic figure, David Brooks, on the  Jim Lehrer News Hour , trying his best to save Bush's reputation by asserting that people like Bush because they think he is more "religious" than Kerry. What is so absurd about this last-ditch attempt to preserve Bush's credibility is that it presumes that anyone can so easily measure such a thing as religiosity. Personally, I have no idea how to assess the different relations Kerry and Bush may entertain with their God, and I would never be so presumptuous as to take their public statements regarding such a relationship as proof of one thing or another. In any case, watching Brooks, and reading the vicious film review presented by Jim Simon of the  Buffalo News , I felt angry to be confronted with the mediocre status-quo once again. Don't these buffoons realize what is at stake?  It would be hard to claim that this movie is pro-Democrat, or pro-Kerry. (And thus it is  urlLink pointless for Nader to complain  that Moore invited to the Washington, DC premiere of  Fahrenheit 9/11  the Democratic political establishment to the exclusion of Nader and his progressive friends.) The Democrats in this movie are shown to be unforgivably complicit and/or spineless in the face of the corporate right's drive to steal the 2000 election and pass off a war for oil as an issue of "national security." Of the Democrats, Gore strikes the most sinister figure, as he pounds his gavel to silence the voices of African-Americans who contest in Congress their obvious disenfranchisement in the 2000 election (and Gore even mocks one of them outright). The larger reason for this film not being "Democrat" is simply that Kerry promises to pursue full-throttle the policies that were put in place to fatten the Bush family and their corporate, oil-thirsty friends. (Kerry supporters, don't give up on your candidate, but keep in mind that, if he wins, a DRASTIC SHIFT in policy would be required to prevent the Democrats from paving the way to the bank for the Bush-Carlyle types who have been riding roughshod over the reputation of the U.S. for their private gain.)  Moore's film is not just a multi-genre film. It is more than a film. It is much bigger and more important than a mere film. It's a call to action. It is a protest against the politics of greed and against the "war on terror" which is, as Moore argues, a "war on the poor" abroad and at home. If its penetrating inquiry into the Bush-Bin Laden relations is as dead-on as it seems, it should rally Americans not only to vote Bush out of office in November, but to chase him and his Administration out of Washington as soon as possible. And this, in the interest of national security and the real war on terrorism; not to mention, in the interest of  democracy .    This morning, I heard a bit of an interview with Bush that was conducted in Ireland yesterday [ed. note: turns out that it was conduced in the White House just before Bush's departure for Ireland]. An Irish reporter asked Bush if he didn't find significance in the fact that so many Irish (15,000 of whom demonstrated on his visit to Ireland) are angry about the torture scandal and about his diverting the war on terror away from Al-Qaeda to Iraq. His response, which I paraphrase here, seemed to confirm the premises of Moore's film. Bush responded by ignoring the comment about Al-Qaeda, as if the diversion of the war away from the actual terrorists responsible for 9/11 were a given and not worth discussing, speaking some platitudes about good Irish-American relations, as if the threat to such relations were not exactly the point of the interviewer's question, and putting all the blame for the torture scandal on the backs of a few soldiers, which tactic only confirms Moore's (and many others') view that the Administration doesn't give a damn about those whom it enlists to do its dirty work (and whose sacrifices it and its supporters use cynically as a shield against criticism of Bush Administration policies).

       "Tell me what it's like in the toilets," is the first line we hear from Ralph Nader in a June 23  urlLink NPR audio report .   Nader is speaking to fifth graders in inner-city Chicago who, as part of a class project, had spent the year trying to improve the conditions in their own school. It is hardly the sort of line we hear spoken by the dominant-party political candidates these days. Nader offers encouragement to the students in their civic endeavors. After highlighting this civic activity, on which Nader had written  urlLink a short piece  in April, NPR cites a host of irrelevant questions that are typically asked of Nader such as--my favorite, a question packaged by the New York Times--"Does the fact that some call yours a 'vanity campaign' hurt your legacy?" and then samples a Nader speaking engagement in Indiana that occurred the next day. Nader here urges citizens to avoid having their vote taken for granted by not indicating that the Democrats have won it by default (even if they do intend to vote for Kerry). This, notes, Siegel, is the closest Nader has come to asking Democrats to support him but vote for Kerry if they feel it is necessary for assuring Bush's defeat.   An interview ensues with Robert Siegel in which Nader makes some typically amusingly sober and incisive comments. I copy here my favorite exchange, in which Nader makes a point that was missing from most of the debates surrounding the week of Reagan eulogies.     Robert Siegel:  If you had been president the week Ronald Reagan died, would you have done some generous eulogy in the Capital Rotunda the way Bill Clinton spoke at Richard Nixon's funeral, or would you speak the way you would always speak of Ronald Reagan, as a genial person who did damage--as you see it--to most of the people of the United States?   Ralph Nader:  Well, there are certain mourning ceremonies that require an equinimity, in fact, so, you don't sieze on the mourning ceremony to go after his misdeeds.    Robert Siegel:  But... you're... what I'm getting at is that you're a partisan. You're one of the great partisans of American life of the late twentieth century. Is the presidency really suitable to that... to that role?   Ralph Nader:  Well, I would not wallow in excessive ceremonies day after day the way presidents do. I mean, there's work to be done. I would go over to the Department of Defense and spend some time there. I would go over to the Department of the Interior, go over to the Food and Drug Administration and motivate the civil servants.  This nearly 12-minute feature on Ralph Nader suggests that  urlLink NPR  is far more open-minded than  urlLink Air America Radio . Air America Radio touts itself as a "liberal" response to the dominant radio right but would never allow Ralph Nader to be featured in such a way, much less to answer questions. Air America Radio is less "liberal" or "progressive" than it is Democrat. It is the Democratic Party answer to right-wing shout radio, not the liberal answer.  What I say here about NPR doesn't mean that I share the right-wing view that NPR is ideologically "left-wing" or "progressive." It simply means that it has not shut its doors to political candidates and office-seeking voices as Air America Radio has. (And the same is true for the Jim Lehrer News Hour, even though its coverage of Nader's campaign is slim. Jim Lehrer allowed Nader to make his case and did not shout him down like Randi Rhodes of Air America Radio did.)

       Someone is trying hard to associate George Bush with the U.S. Air Force. Perhaps it was Bush's dubious stint with the National Guard that has led to this stunt. Call it: "fighter pilot by proxy."  Over the weekend, I found myself in the Canton-Akron airport (Ohio) and, while waiting there for a brother to fly in from out of town, I was startled by the sight of an Air Force recruitment poster. I only wish I had had a camera to capture it. But let me describe it, so that you can understand my reaction. Pictured on the poster was a handsome, smiling, broad-chinned man wearing a flight jacket and helmet, apparently standing on the deck of an aircraft carrier. What unsettled me was that, despite his bold, handsome features, the man was a stunning likeness of George Bush Jr. It was a muscled-up George Bush minus the characteristic smirk. A man in his fifties with slightly graying hair... not exactly the typical Air Force recruit. I asked an elderly couple standing next to me if they had noticed the likeness, and they gasped out acknowledgment. They, too, were offended by this cheap attempt to bolster the president's macho-militarism by proxy.  What does this suggest about our Air Force? And is the big-brother-like, insidious intrusion of George Bush's likeness the only card left in the conservative hand that tries to brush a portrait of Bush, the military hero and foreign policy strong man? When I see George Bush's face, am I supposed to think "tough, handsome, fighter guy"?   If anyone sees this insult to public intelligence and could manage to post a photo of it, I'd appreciate their doing so...

        urlLink Democracynow.org  offers its listeners an interview with former President Bill Clinton that was held on election day, 2000 [click on the image of Clinton to hear it]. Clinton had called the Pacifica radio station without prearrangement to plug Gore for 2-3 minutes to a progressive-minded listenernship and ended up speaking for approximately 30 minutes. Two things struck me about the interview. The first is simply that Clinton is a well-rehearsed speaker who had his hands on more facts and figures in 30 minutes than Bush has been able to muster in three-and-a-half years. Clinton defends his positions admirably (even if one finds reason to disagree with him on certain points). After years of being exposed to an incompetent, inarticulate, failed businessman running the nation's affairs, I was reminded, by this stunning contrast, of what political leadership can be.  The second thing was disturbing. Amy Goodman, the lead interviewer, asked a series of critical questions, making the most of her unscheduled access to the president. This is what anyone would expect from a journalist, I would hope. Nonetheless, a few minutes before the interview was over, Clinton lost his temper and unfairly asserted that Goodman and her co-host were asking "hostile and combative" questions:    Clinton:  "You started this, and every question you've asked has been hostile and combative. So you listen to my answer, will you do that?"  Anyone who listens to this interview, I think, will conclude that none of the questions, nor the tone in which they are asked, can be described as "hostile and combative."   Things got worse. As Amy Goodman explains,    After the show, I got a call from the White House press office. A staffer let me know how furious they were at me for "breaking the ground rules for the interview."   "Ground rules?" I asked. "What ground rules? He called up to be interviewed, and I interviewed him."   "He called to discuss getting out the vote, and you strayed from the topic. You also kept him on much longer than the two to three minutes we agreed to," she huffed.   "President Clinton is the most powerful person in the world," I replied. "He can hang up when he wants to."   The Clinton administration threatened to ban me from the White House and suggested to a Newsday reporter that they might punish me for my attitude by denying me access-not that I had any to lose. White House spokesman Elliot Diringer said, "Any good reporter understands that if you violate the ground rules in an interview, that is going to be taken into account the next time you are seeking an interview."   First of all, we hadn't agreed to any ground rules. Clinton called us. Second, we wouldn't have agreed to any. The only ground rule for good reporting I know is that you don't trade your principles for access. We were treating the president not as royalty, but as a public servant accountable to the people.  What I find particularly ironic about this tactic of threatening to limit access and disparaging critical questioning is that it has become the hallmark of the Bush Administration. One of the questions Amy puts to Clinton is whether or not the two major parties are not consistently bowing to corporate demands, to the detriment of citizen voices. What Clinton says, of course, is that the differences between the parties are enormous (and he does make some convincing arguments for this). But his accusatory, dismissive, protective reaction, including that of his spokesperson who threatened to ban Goodman from access to her executive representation, reminds one of the sort of corporate door-shutting that always greeted Michael Moore in his "The Awful Truth" episodes, where he would try to confront corporate big-wigs in their offices. In short, despite Clinton's willingness to call and speak for thirty minutes, Clinton's actions said: "This is my territory. You have to play by my rules and if you don't, I'm going to have you removed."   This, to my mind, is the language of private corporations, not of government by, of, and for the people. As I said, I find this disturbing. And how about you?

It is a simple matter to copy and paste the  urlLink theater addresses  to your Bcc: line and mass mail a single message.] Dear theater representative,   I am aware that significant pressure is being placed on you by a Republican-aligned consulting group and its supporters not to show Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11 .    I commend you for your showing this controversial, esteemed, and much-anticipated movie. It would be an insult to the American public to deny them the use of their own judgment in such a matter as film-going.   Thank you.

       The following is one of a series of posts at Terrette on Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. " urlLink Move America Forward ," a facade for the political public relations firm Russo Marsh and Rogers, which in the 2001/02 electoral cycle received $2,475,223 in payments from Republican politicians and nothing from Democrat politicans, is trying to dissaude theaters from showing Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11 , set to be released this Friday, June 25. In a statement from the group, we read that:    "Michael Moore has the right to free speech. He has the right to make this movie. But, you know what? We, the American people, have a right to raise our objections to his crass anti-American jihad." The group then says that Moore's film "should be shown at the Democrat National Convention or as an Al Qaeda training video before it's shown at our local cinema."  An Al Qaeda training video? Here is a group that really takes the "with us or against us" logic to its extreme. For them, we have a simple choice: it's either praise the Bush Administration or join an Al Qaeda training camp. Between the Bush White House and a Bin Laden firing range, they see no middle ground.  Consider the simplistic passion of these people. They actually view themselves as fighting Al Qaeda by opposing the public viewing of Moore's film. Here is  urlLink the page  where they provide phone numbers and e-mail addresses that we are supposed to use, to harrass theaters into not showing Moore's film. (Following  urlLink Charles 2 , who originally drew my attention to this "Stop Michael Moore" page, I encourage everyone to contact some of these theaters to do precisely the opposite. We should praise them for not cowering to the intimidation and threats of those who fear voices of patriotic dissent.)   Bill O'Reilly, one of the most popular T.V. news personalities in America, walked out through half of the premiere of Moore's film and, later, to his radio audience,  urlLink likened Moore to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels  - author of the "Big Lie" theory of political communication: "Joseph Goebbels was the minister of propaganda for the Nazi regime and whose very famous quote was, 'If you tell a lie long enough, it becomes the truth.'"  This quote obviously fits better the Bush Administration's undying claim that there is a "relationship" or "contact" or whatever word they want to use to perpetuate the lie that Iraq was supportive of Al Qaeda, since this deceitful claim has been debunked by a number of independent investigators, including the 9/11 Commission, while every factual claim within Moore's film has been rigorously fact-checked and upheld by independent researchers. A New York Times  urlLink article  reports that, "[Moore] ... hired outside fact-checkers, led by a former general counsel of The New Yorker and a veteran member of that magazine's legendary fact-checking team, to vet the film."  Moreover, a writer for  urlLink Fox News has praised the film , and this fact should at the very least startle the vehement pro-Bush forces who are preaching a will-to-ignorance with respect to Moore's film.   A larger question in this whole struggle over the public viewing of a documentary concerns the desire to suppress information. When will those who try to prevent others from reading books and watching movies realize that such efforts are always self-defeating, as they inevitably excite interest in the stigmatized work?

       Have you noticed what has been happening in Spain? Have you managed to distance yourself from the ready-made corporate condemnations of the Spanish and their new government that Americans have been served up in popular U.S. media across political spectrums?  The Spanish have begun to hold public investigations in the terrorist attacks of March 11, 2004 in which 192 people died. That is only a little over three months after the occurrence of the attacks. Moreover, the investigations will not be obstructed by any of the principles involved. The investigators will be allowed to question anyone, including Jose Maria Aznar, the former prime minister. When you compare that to the delayed and spineless "commission" that has been taking place in the States after much obstruction from the Bush administration was removed, and much remained in place, you begin to measure the democracy gap that currently exists between these two countries.   The Bush Administration's "war on terror" is indissociable from its "war on progressive social gains," although it never identifies the latter by its properly descriptive name.  Appearing  to fight the first (which they have done so poorly) assures them the political power to fight the second. And given that they are much more effective at fighting the War on Progressive Social Gains, it seems unusual that this war has not been commonly identified as such in popular media or elsewhere.   In a U.S. political climate darkened by citizen apathy and ignorance, popular media mediocrity, corporate cronyism, contempt among leadership for public opinion and welfare, divisive and backwards-looking social conservatism, misleading and vicious campaign ads and "opposition research," repressive "security" measures, state-promoted torture, executive idolatry and exceptionalism, etc., citizens concerned about the enfeebled state of American democracy can take heart from the rays of hope that are beaming from across the Atlantic. Confronted with many of the same types of problems, the Spanish rid themselves of their Bush-loving conservative leader (Aznar) and, in a very short time, have brought about a revival of Spanish democracy. This example should serve as a source of hope for Americans who know that, in its bid for self-perpetuation, the Bush regime is stacking the cards in its own favor and making a somber situation appear hopeless.   In a  urlLink special report  in the June 15 edition of the  Financial Times , one reads the following:  "Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapatero, leader of the Socialist party and the new prime minister, has begun to reverse many policies pursued during Mr Aznar's eight years in office. Spain's [pro-Bush] foreign policy has been jettisoned in favour of a rapproachement with France and Germany. Spanish troops have been pulled out of Iraq. Compulsory religious education in state schools has been scrapped. Gay marriages will be legalised."   Moreover, they have shut down the country's biggest sweetheart corporate deal, a massively expensive and environmentally irresponsible plan to divert water from the Ebro river in the north of Spain to the south.    The Zapatero cabinet is not peopled with former oil company executives and millionaires, as is the Bush administration. Half of its 16 members are women, and these women have made significant contributions already. Zapatero's administration lacks the contempt for government that is everywhere on display in the Bush administration. Its members understand that government's primary role is to serve the interests of the people.   Another relevant example: Zapatero's government is working to revamp RTVE (Radio y Television Espanola), the public broadcaster which had become a megaphone for official propaganda. (Just as, in the U.S., many "public" broadcasters have, wittingly or not, become cheeleaders for the corporate war-makers who now lead us.) The corruption had gotten so out-of-hand at RTVE that, in one case, the broadcaster was fined by the Spanish supreme court and forced to give an apology to trade unions whose cause it had deliberately misrepresented. In the States, where the public is told by the administration and its attack dogs that the truth-seeking patriot Michael Moore is an enemy to the state, we are very far from any such government-led attempt to reestablish the public mandate of public broadcasting and promote journalistic integrity. Nonetheless, just as in their effective investigation into the Al-Qaeda train bombings and in their decision to move troops from Iraq to Afghanistan, the Spanish are showing us Americans what it means to be a vibrant democracy unshackled by corporate greed. In this way, they are beaming a hopeful light which promises that, soon, such changes may occur in the United States, too.

      This blogger will be returning to the States soon. A Canadian friend said:   "Ah, you are soon to enter your beloved homeland, filled with guns and scary extremist politicians."  Indeed, and it's no joke. There are plenty of extremist and uninformed citizens to support those politicians, too. And some of them are my siblings (may Bush bless them). I am just glad I wasn't in the U.S. during the week-long Reagan beatification. You know the facts: the eventual poster boy for labor busting cheated his way into office by selling weapons illegally to Iran for the promise that American hostages would  not be released  before a hostage-crisis-provoked defeat of Carter so that he, Reagan, could use the weapons money to fight an illegal, covert war against leftist rebels in Central America, where hundreds of thousands of civilians were to die at the hands of the thugs he trained and supported. He spent 3 trillion dollars on weapons and eased the swift descent of 11 million Americans into poverty. And this character is supposed to be a national hero? Yikes!  After flourishing for a good week in the shadows of Reagan's corpse, Bush will have to confront some ugly news from the living: 26 former diplomats and top government officials getting set to condemn his  urlLink pernicious administration of U.S. foreign policy , and Colin Powell calling a recently released annual State Department report asserting a decline in terrorism last year " urlLink a very big mistake " and "very embarrassing." It's been a long time since the brain-freeze of 9/11 swept over the nation, and Americans are wising up to Bush Inc.'s crooked ways.    As for my having to pass through customs, my anti-Bush blogging could be cause for concern, but at present I'm only worried about my guitar getting damaged. Still, who knows what John Ashcroft may have up his sleeve for me? I'd better make sure I know the Pledge of Allegiance by heart and perhaps the names of all the state capitals. Does anyone know the capital of Maine? I always forget that one...   It's supposed to be sunny here at my departure, so I'm hoping my window-seat immobility pays off with clear glimpses of the stunning archipelago.

      In the U.S. House of Representatives, 95% of the seats are deemed  by the two dominant parties  to be "non-competitive." The House is essentially a one-party extension of government, and only 5% of its represented citizens merit real attention from the legislators. In short, 19 out of 20 voters are presented with no choice.    At the state level, 40% of state legislators will have NO opponent, and many others will have merely nominal opponents.   These are some of the facts that support Ralph Nader's  urlLink oft-misunderstood claim  [keyword "Nader" for video] that, in many ways, the two dominant parties are converging into one (which is not a merely topical charge based on recent policy statements or personalities but, rather, on access in the U.S. to elective choices and government influence).  Given this situation (not to mention all the election debacles and the wretched state of popular U.S. press, which, at best, has to apologize for having supplied a megaphone to the administration's propaganda over the months leading up to the undeclared, illegal war in Iraq), I am always stunned to hear Powell or others like him giving "lessons in democracy" to Qatar, Iran, or whatever other nations they feel it is their place to criticize. There are significant differences in the "state of democracy" in these countries, but democracy is hardly a thing assured in the United States. A more accurate assessment, which is only bolstered by the monarchical-like machinations and executive exceptionalism of George Bush Jr., is that it is a thing seriously threatened. (For a recent example of such machinations, see Charles 2's June 9 post, " urlLink extraconstitutional excrement .")

      With the passing of Ronald Reagan, we are likely going to hear the oft-repeated boast that this president was responsible for "victory" in the Cold War. This simplistic assertion bothers me not only because it is absurd to imagine Reagan as being individually responsible for such an overdetermined event as the collapse of the Soviet Union, but because it is vastly naive to imagine that the Cold War has simply ended and that nothing of it remains. The fact is, all the structures that were built to fight this undeclared war are still in place and have only grown stronger since George Bush Jr. was appointed president by the Supreme Court. Terror(ism) has been conveniently fitted with the former footwear of the faded communist foe. Wars are waged without official declaration (as they have been since 1941, the last time war was declared by the U.S.), and forces acting outside the constraints of the U.S. Constitution subvert national and international laws to overturn governments, fabricate national security threats, assassinate democratically-elected political leaders, cynically co-opt the language of democracy and freedom, bend toward self-serving ends mythologies of American cultural and political history, and satisfy wherever possible the sundry interests of a corporate-complicit secret government.   Much more can be said on these issues; but for today, I note that a June 4th  urlLink post from Faramin  drew my attention to a remarkable short documentary narrated by Bill Moyers during Bush's Sr.'s tour in office. This  urlLink documentary  on the origins and powers of the National Security State in the U.S. and its "secret government" is remarkably prescient with particular respect to today's events in corporate America, Iraq, Chile, and Cuba.

       This is one of a series of occasional posts dealing with the notion of forgiveness. Its prevalence in contemporary French philosophy is what drew my attention to it. For today's post, I return to the origin of the loaded, politico-religious notion of forgiveness. As I explained in a previous post, in the related (though distinct) "pardon," which has a particularly political accent in English that is missing in other languages, the notion paradoxically is inscribed in law and at the same time serves as an exception to law. This paradox haunts contemporary American politics, which regularly erupt in discord whenever the president, whose power to grant pardons is effectively both lawless  and  legal, is attacked for exercising the power in accordance with the Constitution.   Not only does discord erupt over the application of the power, but also over its consequences, which today remain enveloped in legal obscurity. In October 2003, the Supreme Court refused to hear a case on a presidential pardon granted to William A. Borders, a lawyer pardoned for bribery whose disbarment in 1983 had nonetheless remained in effect. On the basis not only of a rigorous notion of the pardon (insofar as its heritage coincides with that of forgiveness), but of a Supreme Court ruling in 1866--a clear precedent--that reinstated a pardoned Confederate official to the Supreme Court bar by arguing that a pardon "blots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offense," Borders, who was represented by Kenneth Starr and Charles Ogletree Jr., would presumably have been reinstated. However, the chief disciplinary official for the D.C. bar, Joyce E. Peters, urged the Court not to consider the case on grounds of William Border's "character;" and, with that, the Court voted 4-3 to refuse to hear the case. The curious implication of this decision is that a presidential pardon, though nearly unlimited in its scope of application (which covers offenses against the United States that are not impeachable), can be blocked up with respect to disabilities with the mere evocation of "character" (as if "character" applied to only a few select types of misdeeds), and disabilities therefore can remain attached to the pardoned figure, as if he or she had never, in fact, been pardoned. [ urlLink This story  was reported on by Linda Greenhouse of the NY Times on October 21, 2003.]  This is the obscure context of forgiveness in which I propose to look at the origin of the notion. I discussed in a previous post the thesis that the notion has a non-religious, non-theological origin, and today I will consider Alain Gouhier's etymological investigation of forgiveness or, in the author's French,  le pardon .   The story begins with Aesop. But before Aesop can be discussed, one must note a "problem" relating to the arrival of "pardon" on the scene (in Latin:  perdonare ). In the first and second century, " perdonare " was absent in Biblical and patristic Latin (which is to say, in all extent documents from that time), whereas it is found in the very first written documents in Romance languages. Gouhier hypothesizes credibly that " perdonare " existed in spoken Latin, from which the Romance language derived, while being refused by the early Christian theologians.   The Latin translation of a line in a fable by Aesop concerning a lion and a shepherd had always been rendered by " incolumitate donare ." But a new translation by Romulus, made around the year 400, replaces  donare  with   perdonare  : " incolumitate perdonatur ." The tacking-on of the prefix will later know a brilliant career in Christian dogma as the privileged lever of power exercised by God in for-giving ( par-donner ) humanity, where humanity is deemed powerless to forgive itself. Here is the fable, in modern English:    urlLink The Lion And The Shepherd    A LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn. Soon afterward he came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail as if to say, "I am a suppliant, and seek your aid." The Shepherd boldly examined the beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his lap, pulled it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into the forest. Some time after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false accusation, was condemned "to be cast to the Lions" as the punishment for his imputed crime. But when the Lion was released from his cage, he recognized the Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead of attacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap. The King, as soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set free again in the forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and restored to his friends.  Although the pardon received was in a sense earned by the presumed good deeds of the shepherd and thus warranted by mitigating circumstances relating to the condemned man's "character," a Latin translation of this fable opens the door to the long career of Christian dogma that recognizes the absolute giving of forgiveness as a divine power alone. The shift in this translation allows for nothing less than the swallowing up of Greek thought by the Christian Godhead. It has been argued by scholars of Ancient Greece, including Danièle Aubriot and Jacqueline de Romilly, that the Greeks lacked a notion of limitless, unconditional forgiveness of the sort found conceptualized in Christianity and other Abrahamic religions (alongside conditional logics which also are found in these religious traditions). The Greek word  suggnômé , which has no cognate in modern languages, would best be rendered by "intellection." It implies not the forgiving of a misdeed that is known to have been willed intentionally by the accused, but the eventual comprehension of a fault to which ignorance alone had given rise. In short, the Greeks did not have a conception of "radical, willed evil." This assertion can be substantiated by reference to Socrates, for whom evil was always the consequence of mere ignorance.

      While awaiting the release of Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  in the U.S., I decided to watch François Truffaut's English-language   urlLink Fahrenheit 451  , which appeared in 1966. As you know, 451 is the degree at which paper burns and, in Moore's figurative extension, 9/11 is the "temperature at which freedom burns." I won't develop a review of Truffaut's film here but wish to suggest a few things about it, obliquely.   The biggest contrast it marks with Michael Moore's latest work is that it is largely suggestive, elusive, and  untimely . Apparently, Truffaut's film received a tepid reception. It has been suggested, however, that the film has gained in power over the years as people have learned not to confound it with the sci-fi films that were produced in abundance during the same period. The real achievement of the film, I think, is that it withholds certain sci-fi aspects of Bradbury's narrative so as to produce a passionate championing not only of books, but of human language and of the human impulse to remember. It made me think in particular about the precious but vulnerable medium of online communication, and of how the conventionally understood contrast between "books" and "computers" is not so radical. For one, so much of the language we use in speaking of computers, such as "page" and "bookmark" and "notepad," etc., comes straight from the world of books. But the inheritance is more than linguistic. The very shape of our computer screens retains the memory of rectangular paper. And one could develop this inheritance at great length (which is something Jacques Derrida does in  Papier Machine , Galilée, 2001).   Anyone who liked Truffaut's  Jules et Jim  should know that  urlLink Oskar Werner , who played Jules, here plays the lead role of Montag, the fireman whose job it is to burn books, in what is a similarly quirky and sensitive performance. And if you can rent the DVD, know that it includes an excellent short documentary about the making of the film.

Charles 2, of  urlLink The Fulcrum , who has just posted a stunning photograph of rainbows, and Andante of  urlLink Collective Sigh , inquired about the specifications of the Freedom Roller (see May 28th post).

       Forgive the appearance of slander, but the urgency of this year's election does not permit me to let glaring incompetence go unnoticed.  New York Times columnist David Brooks, a conservative pundit featured weekly on the Jim Lehrer News Hour, always gets a sparkle of idiot admiration in his eyes after viewing George Bush giving a stump speech. The idiocy of the sparkle is confirmed by Brooks's comments. Brooks apparently sees "authenticity" in Bush's gruff manners, his syncopated gestures, and "simple folk" accent (which he adopted from Texas-born citizens), because this is the imprecise and somewhat mystical category by which Brooks assesses public figures time and again. In  urlLink this exchange , from the July 30 program, David Brooks responded to Jim Lehrer's question about the negative tone of the campaigns in this way: JIM LEHRER: What about the negative thing, for instance we ran a while ago, what Kerry ads had to say today and what President Bush had to say today. President Bush was on Kerry's record. Would you interpret that as a negative?   DAVID BROOKS: I think that's fine. First of all one of the most annoying tropes of the convention was we're uniting, we're not divisive, and then they said something incredibly nasty about the Republicans. Kerry said, that they don't care, the people who talk about family values don't value their families, so republicans don't value their families. But that's not divisive.   Not so fast, Brooks. The Democrats did not say that the Republicans don't value their families. It's irresponsible to exaggerate the Democrats' claim about the plight of the middle class in this way, by making it appear that the Democrats are saying, in essence, "The Republicans don't like their children." Brooks goes even further than this by winding his comment up with a smug quip (apparently meant to ring true as irony). "But that's not devisive," chuckle, chuckle. I wonder, though, is it truly "incredibly nasty" to point out the well-established fact that Republican tax "relief" has shifted the tax burden from the wealthiest in the land to working families? Why is that "incredibly nasty"? Is it not, rather, "incredibly nasty" to squeeze the middle class while claiming to be the pro-family Party? That seems to me a more relevant question, and it's the one that Americans have a right to ask.   Brooks then turns to George Bush's comments and says this:    DAVID BROOKS: But, you know, if you were going to call somebody a traitor or un-American, that's out of bounds. And I think that will be out of bounds. But if you're going to say he voted this way, he made that decision, that's what it's supposed to be all about.  I find it very hard to understand how Brooks is able to make such a distinction between Bush's criticisms of Kerry's voting record (which criticisms Brooks deems "what it's supposed to be all about") and the Democrats' criticisms of the Republican voting records that led to unjust tax breaks for the wealthiest 2% of the nation (which Brooks portrays as a distortion and a low blow).   I have a real irony for Mr. Brooks to chuckle over. In the same speech to which Brooks was referring (given by Bush in Missouri on July 30), Bush said that "we stand for the institutions of marriage and the family," with implications that Brooks, to remain consistent with himself, could only deem "incredibly nasty." Those implications are that, by contrast, the Democrats are not only against marriage and family but, like any unapologetic anarchists the world over, are against institutions! And where, I ask, is the voting record to demonstrate that?

       If Iowa's primary was as decisive as the pundits said -- making Kerry seem "electable" early on and assuring him his subsequent ascendancy -- we owe the State's voters a deep expression of gratitude this morning. John Kerry's speech last night put to rest any doubt that he is the best major-party candidate for the presidency of the United States. And what a tremendous speech it was! Somehow, Kerry managed to take the high road while neither appearing simplistic and abstract -- that was Edwards's error the night before -- nor failing to make a mockery of the Rove-wing propaganda machine and the failures of the Bush Administration generally. By implicit comparison more than by explicit critique, Kerry's gutsy and eloquent performance exposed the incompetent, mean-spirited and puny nature of the sanctimonious and hypocritical man named Bush, who is incapable of inspiring anything in his auditors but fantastical fear. Even Nader, with whom I agree on virtually every issue, appears, next to Kerry, to be a mere hairshirt. No wonder that when Nader emerged from his discussion with Kerry he called him "presidential." His saying later that Kerry doesn't speak his own mind seems unfair. There were several remarkably strong statements in Kerry's speech. One of the most stunning was his criticizing the Bush Administration for its seedy relationship with the Saudi royal family. Yes, even Unger and Moore made it into this speech! This took real chutzpah; it was certainly more than a convention-cautious or poll-friendly tactic. Others included Kerry's unequivocal call for universal health care and his mocking the Vice President for his secretive environmental policy meetings. That was the genius of Kerry's speech: to present progressive values as American values and not as an ideological alternative to political opposition.  Kerry remains imperfect, of course; I have often criticized him and other Democrats on this blog and elsewhere, and there will certainly be a time for renewing some of these criticisms, but now is a time for celebrating the arrival of a true leader in our midst. I feel confident that this speech marks a downturn in the Bush campaign that will lead to Bush's certain defeat. Bush can always ponder a future acting career in self-parodying comedies or make his vacation in Crawford permanent. As for Nader, there will be a time for donning hairshirts and we can even envision that one day such shirts be made out of industrial hemp, but this is Kerry's election and Americans can do nothing to shame themselves and their heritage more than to elect Bush and Cheney in November.   p.s. As reported on National Public Radio this morning, the Bush Administration, up to its petty-minded media machinations again, has orchestrated the delayed release of last weekend's  urlLink capture of a terrorist suspect in Pakistan  so that it would coincide with news of Kerry's Convention speech this morning. This was not the big fish many had foreseen for this week, but it was apparently the best the Bush Administration could do. It seems that the Bush Administration has not learned the lesson of the former right-wing government in Spain, which is that voters can see through such cheap attempts at manipulating political events for the sake of political points.

       John Edwards spoke last night at the Democratic Convention in Boston. Aside from the fact that he spoke about race issues -- which is rare -- (without, however, proposing any specific policy to counter racism in the United States), there were many disturbing, concessionary moments to his speech.  Edwards said we are at "war." No, we are not at war. And no, WE are not at war. Why did Edwards adopt this fascist tactic from the Republicans? There is no war. No war declared. But there was a war declared "won." This equation doesn't hold up to the simplest rule of mathematics. We cannot allow our leadership to have its war and defeat it, too. This is not only illogical, it is intolerable to an extreme, and its consequences for social justice have been, and will no doubt continue to be, devastating.   Edwards also spoke of securing the peace of Israel and implied that that could be done by imposing "democracy" on Iraq. This is the same mistaken assumption of Bush Inc., which assumption only feeds other greed-driven motivations and serves as the most beautiful of all their cynical pretexts for aggression. My question is: what is it doing in the Democratic Convention?   And why did Edwards not mention the Palestinians? Does he think they have no stake in Middle East peace? Does he agree with Bush that they are "undesirables" and therefore "unmentionables" and therefore not really human beings whose plight should enter into our policy statements, if not into our policies? How can America regain its fine reputation around the world if we persist in backing Israel's policies, some of which are denounced almost unanimously in the U.N. and by the International Court for Justice?   Edwards spoke of "everything being possible" in America, no matter your skin color or "the family you are born into." Well, is it possible in America to run for a prominent office without having a perfect (or near perfect) hairdo? Is it possible to run without being able to flash to the public the image of a "family man" surrounded by his "happy family"? Those are becoming much bigger barriers to public service access than are the issues of race and sex (which, granted, are huge barriers still, and not at all likely to be removed by Democratic leadership in the next four or eight years).   Edwards did not once mention the environment. He also did not mention the 8 years of "peace and prosperity" of the Clinton years (an expression to be taken with a truckload of salt, for sure). He spoke as if he were not existing in the same space-time dimension as the rest of us. Apparently, for him -- and he certainly has been taught to believe this by the far right currently in power -- time began on September 11, 2001, and every social issue since then must be cloaked in a machoistic show of military bravado targeted at the impossibly vague and endless threat of "terrorism." My question is: can't the Democrats distinguish between "terrorism" and terrorists?   It was refreshing that Al Sharpton broke with the script last night, but he addressed primarily the African-American concerns over voting rights. The Democrats need someone to break with the most offensive part of the script that was drawn up for them by the Republican party after 9/11 and denounce once and for all the illegal aggression in Iraq.  This is how Democracy Now! described Edwards' speech:   Ignoring Delegates Anti-War Stance, Edwards Delivers Major Pro-War Address at DNC. Although a recent poll shows 95 percent of Democratic delegates oppose the Iraq war, Edwards vows in a prime-time address to double the number of special forces in Iraq and to increase funding for military research.

       Michael Moore spoke in Cambridge yesterday to an audience of 500-600 (with more than 1,000 outside who could not get in but whom he addressed later). This is a truly rousing speech -- the only one that could have rivaled Barack Obama's inspirational performance from Tuesday night. Obama's and Moore's speeches aired on this morning's  urlLink Democracy Now! . The video and audio feeds of Moore's speech begin at 1:08:00 of the day's two-hour feed.   Democracy Now! also reports the following about Moore's activities:   "Everywhere Moore has gone in Boston, massive crowds have followed him. In fact the Kerry campaign is probably quite happy that the filmmaker is leaving town today. Moore is actually heading into George W. Bush's backyard in Crawford Texas, where he will introduce a showing of his film Fahrenheit 9/11 at a football stadium. Moore says he has invited the film's star, President Bush, to attend the show. While Fahrenheit 9/11 has now topped the $100 million mark, no theater in Crawford or the surrounding towns would show the movie, until last week when it was picked up by a theater in Waco. That's why Moore decided to do his own screening near Bush's Crawford ranch."

       Both President Bush and British Prime Minister Blair have each had to confront a damning report on the intelligence failures leading up to the Iraq war. Although both leaders still insist that the war was justified, Blair has since said "I accept full personal responsibility for the way the issue was presented and therefore for any errors made." Bush has yet to make any such statement.   This past Monday, veteran White House correspondent Helen Thomas took on White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan on the issue.   White House Press Briefing, July 19, 2004.   Helen Thomas:  Prime Minister Blair took full personal responsibility for taking his nation into war under falsehoods -- under reasons that have been determined now to be false. Is President Bush also willing to take full, personal responsibility --   Scott McClellan:  I think Prime Minister Blair said that it was the right thing to do; that Saddam Hussein's regime was a threat.   Helen Thomas:  Those were not the reasons he took his country into war. It turned out to be untrue, and the same is true for us. Does the President take full, personal responsibility for this war?   Scott McClellan:  The issue here is what do you to with a threat in a post-September 11th world? Either you live with a threat, or you confront the threat.   Helen Thomas:  There was no threat.   Scott McClellan:  The President made the decision to confront the threat.   Helen Thomas:  Saddam Hussein did not threaten this country.   Scott McClellan:  The world -- the world, the Congress and the administration all disagree. They all recognized that there was a threat posed by Saddam Hussein. When it came to September 11th, that changed the equation. It taught us, as I said --   Helen Thomas:  The Intelligence Committee said there was no threat.   Scott McClellan:  As I said, it taught us that we must confront threats before it's too late.   Helen Thomas:  So the President doesn't take full responsibility?   Scott McClellan:  The President already talked about the responsibility for the decisions he's made. He talked about that with Prime Minister Blair.   Helen Thomas:   Personal  responsibility?   Scott McClellan:  (Pointing to another journalist) Terry, go ahead.

       Today, I went to www.foxnews.com and saw that they had an online poll concerning the death penalty. At the time I consulted the site, 59% of the more than 50,000 respondents had clicked on "in favor of capital punishment for minors" and only 7% were against capital punishment in all cases (including me).That made me wonder, what sort of sick people use www.foxnews.com? Is it Fox that produces such twisted minds, or do the twisted minds simply gravitate towards Fox? Or both?   When I searched the web for "death penalty" using Fox's search engine, the first site that came up was   urlLink  Pro-deathpenalty.com   . It&nbsp;was stated by Fox that the search results were found by Yahoo!, but when I searched with Yahoo! without having the Fox site open, I didn't see that pro-death penalty site in the search returns. Strange how that works...   Is there another industrialized nation calling itself a democracy that puts child offenders to death? What a proud distinction we Americans can claim for ourselves! Aeiggghh!

       After returning from Afghanistan and learning that he would be shipped to Iraq, Jeremy Hinzman had his conscientious objector's status rejected by the U.S. Army, and so he fled, with his wife and son, to Canada, where he has filed for refugee status. He has been  urlLink interviewed  about his case. You can visit his  urlLink homepage  and send him a letter of support. Here is mine: Jeremy, Nga, Liam:  This morning -- July 15, 2004 -- I listened to Jeremy speaking on Democracy Now! and I was very impressed with both his courage and articulateness. I cannot say that I am a pacifist -- that I oppose all wars -- but in the current climate of corporate war-making dressed up in the abstract language of good and evil and cynically wrapped in the self-righteous mythology of the United States, Jerermy's actions represent an admirable aspect of America that many nations today have lost sight of.   A friend of mine who lives in France even refuses to visit the United States at this time, since she has made the unfair assumption that the aggressive actions of the corporate elites in Washington D.C. reflect the mentality of American citizens generally. Jeremy, thank you for standing up and, since it was necessary in your case, thank you for getting out! I will share your story with my friend. And may other young men and women who are enticed by the short-term rewards dangled before them by U.S. military recruiters take your example of courage to heart.   And thank you Canada for being the welcoming, tolerant, and just nation that, in America, has largely become a thing of twisted political mythology.  And here is part of another letter (from  urlLink Jeremy's homepage ):   Dear Jeremy,  I was in the 82nd as well for a while and in the army for five years. Although my first instinct was to think you were shirking responsibility, after reading your reasoning I really admire what you've done. It had to take an awful lot of courage, especially in this time of Republican intimidation and a nation that seems, quite disturbingly, almost content not to know the truth. I left the 82nd at the end of 2000 and can vouch for how poorly they treat their soldiers. [An example is given here.] After that I went to Australia with the money I'd saved up from my "enduring nonsense" deployment and as I'm sure you're finding now, citizens of the other English-speaking nations are very friendly and have a much less xenophobic outlook on the world. They also don't have to live in fear of people thinking they're "un-patriotic" simply for pointing out the rampant hipocrosy and sickening greed of the current administration. I wish you and your family all the luck in the world, yours truly,  Sean, North Carolina

      Mike Molloy has a fine analysis of  fascist speechifying  as it reappears time and again in Bush’s public statements.  This is a  vital listening  exercise for all citizens of the United States.    Scroll to the bottom of  urlLink this page  and click on Molloy’s picture on the left (which has “1984” superimposed on it).   And next time you hear Bush give a public speech, see if you can identify the “five steps” of fascist speechifying that he routinely employs. Who knows? Perhaps this can provide a diversion for the whole family and give a much-needed break from the daily routine of reality TV and the Bill O'Reilly Catholic Rage Hour. At least it would be more interesting (and healthy) than taking Bush at his word.

       I don't know if it has been through corporate infiltration or what, but "On the Media," a program that used to provide critical commentary on media issues, has become a megaphone for corporate interests. This would be an understandable role if it were run by Microsoft or General Electric, but it is presumably supported by the public and has the public interest in mind.  Presumably...    Here is my recent letter. Dear On the Media,    A long-time listener to your program via WNED AM 970 in Buffalo, NY, I listened with my jaw dropped to the floor this weekend as you reached new depths of corporate-minded mediocrity by bashing Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  with the help of Newsweek's Isikoff (who repeated the claims that have been publicly debunked and exposed as ideologically driven) and by giving a defense of the Carlyle group with the help of its recently hired damage-control PR man.   It is easy to research these issues better than you have. Here is  urlLink one source  that, at the very least, would have provided you, and your listeners, with a reasoned rebuttal to Isikoff's claims.   With this new emphasis at On the Media on defending corporate interests to the exclusion or denigration of opposing voices, I have a few suggestions for future topics that you might enjoy covering.    i) How Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" is pure liberal conspiracy theory which, if burned, would add less ozone-depleting compounds to the environment than does Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.

       On July 30, the Jim Lehrer News Hour assembled " urlLink likely voters " [video link] after they had watched John Kerry deliver his nomination acceptance speech, to discuss their reactions to the speech and the Democratic Convention as a whole. What disturbed me to the point of making me want to crawl into a cave and remain there till November 2nd, biding my time by praying that some sense might be visited upon my fellow citizens, was the tendency among these "likely voters" to "reason" by means of slogans. Two examples:  Lu Ryden said: "I keep thinking of him as the number one liberal in Congress." And, "as you know, he's the number one liberal... and... Edwards, the number four liberal."   The interviewer did not ask Miss Ryden what "number one liberal" is supposed to mean, let alone "number four liberal," nor who established this order and by what criteria. This phrase is supposed to evoke something ominous, if I understand Miss Ryden's use of it. But why? The whole "ordering of liberals" reminds me of the playing cards passed around in Iraq by the U.S. military as a demeaning and cynical way of identifying members of the Hussein regime. It betrays an arrogant "gotcha" mentality that is even less welcome in domestic politics, since it seems tailored to dispense with argument and fact-checking in favor of demonizing labels. Jim Zemlin, an "undecided" Republican, self-described as one who has "started businesses and taken risks," said this: "My concern was a sort of class warfare theme that I got. You know, tax the rich, give to the poor."   I recognize this phrase as one that has been belched out of radios by the likes of Rush Limbaugh for years. The curious distortion wrought by this charge of "class warfare" is that it is applied not to the Republican policies that strangle the middle class and choke off opportunity for middle-class entrepreneurs such as Jim Zemlin by raising their share of the tax burden, but only to those who take the Republicans to task for such measures. So, tell me, why does the Democrats' saying they are for giving the middle class a chance constitue "class warfare"? Why does the struggle for the middle class constitute class warfare, whereas the struggle for the wealthy few does not?  If such slogan think is widespread, I can understand how it is that Kerry and Bush are still running neck 'n' neck, but that doesn't leave me feeling any less saddened at the spectacle of citizens who, seduced by a label, vote against their own interests.   Any speliologists out there who would kindly suggest a place I might settle?
