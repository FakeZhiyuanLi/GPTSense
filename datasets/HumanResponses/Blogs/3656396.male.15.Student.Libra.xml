      Ever wondered where the christian god came from?  He does exist... so does every other god ever concieved... because we willed them to be.. It makes perfect sense.  Theres a force, humans have... and theres a force of earth. one can manipulate the other, and vice versa... humans have willed that there is a god, karma, and hell, so you will be affected by these.... its prolly about 60/40 in your favor as to what you will believe though... that perfectly axplains all the "Miricles" performed by jesus... and all the other things that we call "magick", so long as you believe, its possible.....

      This city blows. Im in DC, our nation's capitol... its lame... a couple of cool stores, a few museams, but nothing realy cool... unless your rich... I wanna get back, to my city by the bay! ohhh oh oh ohhh... errr, nevermind... thats a Journey rip... Marshall is about as landlocked as you can get.  Well, It's lame-er, (than Marshall,) but my fellowes are there.  I walked into a womens underwear store, and no one looked at me wierd! (Im a guy...)  I went there and bought a bottle of nail polish, and went to claires, and bought an afeminate choker, and noone even raised an eyebrow.  Thats tolerance for you.  To all the nice people in the world, thank you, for accepting people who do things a little on the wierd side... like femme guys, or butch girls, they aren't gay, and if they were? who cares! so thanks for making my life esier, and to everyone who looks at me or anyone with hatefull prejudice, I can't say that some mythos of a god will teach you a lesson in the afterlife, but maybe I can teach you one now.....

      life sucks! but, when you got people who love you..... No, I dont mean a false christian god, created by insecure existentialists..., I mean real people, flesh and blood, (not your mom) who geuinely care about how you feel, its cool.  Lacy to me, is one such person... She makes me smile when I think of the things she says, and I know I would kill thousands of people just to be with her in need, not that the lives of the masses mean much, but still, not one of them could ever amount to how I feel about her...  yeah, as I sit, waiting for her yahoo im to pop up in an hour or two, I cant help but smile when I reflect on our relationship... weve had some missunderstandings, but hey,! now were better for it. if you ever get the off chance to read this lacy, hugs & kisses, hope to see ya soon baby.

      This is me... I Live in Marshall, its about 3 miles outside of Podunk, just down the road from Bumfuck, and way the hell out of Dodge. (jk)  I sit with my friends in school, and for the hell of it, they are... (In a very particular order...) Sherry Meeks, Susi Robinson, Lacy Davis, Steven Britton, and others... sorry guys! If you got a problem with one of these people, then tell me please so I can slit your throat.  Well.. I guess thats it.  Oh yeah... I am Sherry's knight... she is at my side, and I defend her with magick. (seriously, don't cross her.... you might wind up dead.)... and Im single! So, if you dont care about your reputation, (and obviously live in or around Marshall,) give me an E-mail....
