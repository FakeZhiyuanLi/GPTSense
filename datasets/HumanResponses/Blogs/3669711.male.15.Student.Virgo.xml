      Well, today i saw the sequal to Spiderman, you guessed it, Spiderman 2!! (aptly named movie)  Well, i will give you my reflections on it.    What do a movie with a good storyline, a good way of telling the story, lots of exciting action, a hot girl, a guy with 8 limbs ironicly named 'Doc Ock', and a guy in a suit with spiders plastered over it?  A good movie!  Especially if that movie has the suffix '2' after the title.  Yes thats right, spiderman 2 was a good movie, even if you aren't into the whole 'Marvel Superhero' thing.    I can recall when i heard about the first spiderman movie... i didn't think much of it, because i wasn't so much of a spiderman fan at the time.  Sure, i had watched the cartoon several times, and more or less read a comic book or two, but i was never really a 'fan'.  I didn't see the movie when it first came out, i didn't even see it when it came to DVD and VHS.  I waited untill just last summer to see it.  I have to say, i was impressed.  So impressed that i went out and bought the DVD for a very expensive price of $32.99.    When i saw the commercials for Spiderman 2, i was very much impressed.  It looked better than the first one!  And indeed, it matched up to those high standards.  It used a bit more story building this time around, and had the same moderate bits of action.  The villan was a bit cooler too.    Well, that is what i think about spiderman 2.  The final verdict (all verdicts are final) 2 thumbs up for spiderman 2! ^_^   Lates

      Last night, before going to sleep, i was listening to my  urlLink Rage Against the Machine  - Renegades album (quite a good album i might add).  Well, i was listening to the song ' urlLink Renegades ' (hence the title of the album), and it got me thinking.  This is what i thought about.  What do you think a renegade is?  It sounds sort of evil to some, to some it might sound heroic, but what is the deffinition of a renegade?  In the song it says 'Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies, They change the course of history, Everyday people like you and me...'  and i would think that to be fairly accurate.  Renegades are people who have a unique view on life that may change the world as we know it, but they aren't all that special, just normal people.    I also went to dictionary.com to find out what it had to say about renegades: 1. One who rejects a religion, cause, allegiance, or group for another; a deserter. 2. An outlaw; a rebel.  Now, that doesn't sound so good, they desert others, they aren't trustworthy, they rebel against others.  Thats not good at all.    So, who would was a renegade?  Some examples the song gives are Cheif Sitting Bull, Tom Paine, Dr. Martin Luther King, and Malcom X.  Now, i don't know most of the people mentioned, but i do know that Martin Luther King was a good man, fighting for Black Rights.  He doesn't sound so bad.    From what i have looked at here, a renegade is a person who has his own views on life, they are ordinary people with vision, and they will do anything to have their views realized and accepted, even if they have to betray other people. Renegades are radicals that want to help or hinder the world, that is up to them. All i can say is, i am NOT a renegade.   Lates

      Today, i tried using some CS hacks.  I was doing horrible, so i decided, if hax would make me any better, i would try them out.    Well, i got this 'master' cs hack.  It came with an aimbot, wallhacks (multiple ones), and a thing that negates the effects of smoke and flash grenades.  Sounds pretty cool, no?  Well, the last features were, the wallhacks were sort of lame.. and the aimbot sucked.  What it did was lock onto the target, and just 'hold' down the trigger, even if i was out of bullets.  And it wouldn't reload either.    That didn't help me much.  I also tried out the wallhacks, they didn't do much, i couldn't see through where i wanted to.    In the end, i was better without the hacks.  I've decided to come clean, i deleted the hacks.  The lesson learned today, is that it's not good to cheat!  Lates

      I'm a total  urlLink Sony  junkie.  I love everything Sony, my T.V's, my VCR's, my DVD players, my Amp, my CD Player, my next Laptop (Vaio *shivers* so beautiful), My PS2, and my  urlLink MicroVault .    You might be wondering what a MicroVault is?  Well, its just a fancy name for a USB memory stick.  128 MB (the one in the link above is 256 MB, i got the smaller cheaper one), USB 2.0, other neat features like Password Lock, Auto Zip, and PC Lock.  Why, you ask, am i blogging about this little peice of hardware?  In reality, i don't know.  Its just what came to mind.  I got the neat little thing for Christmas 2003, i wanted a USB memory key for a while, because that mean i could download stuff on the school computers, that i couldn't download at home because of dial up limitations, and bring it home with me on my memory key.  The purpose for that was erased when i also recieved my laptop with built in 802.11B wirless.    I actually do use the little guy quite a bit.  Since wireless networking is far from perfect, i find that transfering files from my laptop to my desktop, or vice-versa, is easier using the key.  Just today, i inserted the mini-CD that came with it, to see the extra features.    My MicroVault is an important piece of my 'computery' stuff, if i didn't have it, i wouldn't be transfering stuff... lol, not so big of a deal.  I still like it, and, hey!, its Sony!

      The bulk of my afternoon this fine bright Sunday was spent fixing up my old clunker PC.  Yeah, thats right, 'fixing up'.  I'll tell you what i did.    When that computer was decommissioned from being the 'main PC', it moved into my room.  Yay, i finally had a computer in my room.  My life was complete.  I was armed with the awesome power of windows ME and dial up internet, right at my fingertips.  The dream was short lasted though.  I soon noticed that the 17' monitor was far to large for my tiny desk.  It was promptly moved downstairs, only to be left alone.  It would occasionally get turned on, for random things.   Then my Linux craze started up.  I wanted to test Linux on a machine that i didn't care about, and what PC came to mind, the old clunker.  So, i wiped the hard drive, got out the Debian Linux cd, popped it into the drive, and installed it.  Unfortunately, i must have missed some steps in the install, because there was a 'kernel panic' and Debian wouldn't boot.  Just my luck.    After that, the old clunker just sat down there, OS-less, not really doing anything.  Well, yesterday, my mom told me that she wanted to use it, and i was like ok.  This afternoon has been quite hectic too, running up and down the stairs, getting a mindblowing number of CS's and such.  This was especially hard considering my knee is 'decommissioned' also.  Can't bend that sucker too well.    Well, i formatted using DOS, popped in the handy-dandy Compaq quick restore disk, and it got up to about 72%, and said pop in the 2nd cd.  Well, that was a bit of a problem, since i only had a single cd.  I looked around a little, and finally found one that had '2' scribbled on the paper sleeve.  I popped that one in, and it worked.  Well, Win 95 booted correctly, and i was in business. But i didn't stop there, i also took the extra effort in putting on the overrated  Windows ME.    After the legnthy install process, i promptly changed the ugly desktop wallpaper, and put on a few convince programs, Norton Utilities (1995), Norton Anti-Virus (1995), and Microsoft Office 97.  Ok, so they are a little old, but who said old wasn't good?  Lets just hope that i don't get any of these 'new fangled' virus's.  Lates

      I've been using Firefox for a while now, and I'm very impressed with what they have to offer.  With the recent addition of the new 0.9, it gets even better.  Here are some of the highlights.  First of all, there are cool themes that you can use with firefox, much like the older versions.  Not much has changed, except they look a bit cooler.  A little more eye candy.  The one i have right now, i really like.  Its called Noia 2.0 (eXtreme), and you can get it from  urlLink this site .    Another cool thing is the extentions that you can use.  This is also not changed, but there are tons of new extensions that are available.  One of the coolest ones is called 'bugmenot'.  Have you ever been annoyed by websites that ask you to sign up for them first before you can review their material?  Well, be annoyed no more, bugmenot is here!  Bugmenot is joined to a forum on the internet where people have given away usernames and passwords for certain annoying sites.  All the firefox 0.9 users have to do is right click, select bugmenot from the menu, and you will probably get a username and password.  You can review other extensions  urlLink here .  The biggest change of firefox is the menu's.  Now, you don't have to go into tools -> options all the time to go to the extensions and themes.  They are right on the tools bar.  Very good.  I applaud the people at mozilla.  Lates

      Well, my CS skillz are coming along.  Deffinately, whoever said 'practice makes perfect' was absolutally right.    Since my job offer didn't come through for today, i was forced to play CS for the entire morning.  I started off sucking, like normal.  Then i started to get a bit better.  I was about 9 for 14.  Pretty good.  Next game 10 for 12.  Next game 14 for 15.   Next game 17 for 12.  W00t!  I'm starting to get back my m4d sk1llz!!  Next thing you know, i'll be as much of a CS junkie as i am a DoD junkie.  Damn these Half-life mods and their addictability...  Lates

      This world is a funny place.  Many of the best things in life are overlooked.  This is an unfortunate happening that takes place everywhere in the world today.    Lets first talk about T.V.  One of the shows that I admired most was  urlLink Mobile Suit Gundam Wing.   This aired on  urlLink YTV  about 2 - 3 years ago.  At the time that i started watching it, it aired at around 9 pm, right after the  urlLink DBZ  block.  I guess not many people were watching it, so they moved it to air around 2 am.  I had thought they canceled it, untill i looked in the TV guide.  Unfortunately, it was canceled just after they had aired the whole series.  This show, in my opinion, was about 200 times better than DBZ could ever be.  It was projected towards an older audience, due to the subjects that were discussed throughout the series, even thought it was a 'giant robot' cartoon.  It had subjects like love, peace, respect, and all sorts of things that were great in it, not to mention really cool giant robots, and amazing animation.  But DBZ got the vote for that time slot, and now 'Wing' is off the air.    On a much more serious note, one of the things that is most overlooked is the  urlLink Bible .  The MOST important book in all of liturature.  It has an answer to every question, a solution to ever problem, including death.  Most people just look past it, thinking it is just 'religious mumbo-jumbo'.  They are wrong about that in every way.  urlLink  Beyond Good and Evil  is a very good game in my opinion.  It has a good method of story telling, has good character development, has good graphics, has good voices, has good gameplay, and has good music.  These are all the things that make a game great, but i found it for $14.98 in the bargain bin.  Why is this?  Because all great things are left unnoticed.  Lets hope that when another great thing is revealed, people will take note of this.    Lates

      Finally... after many months of waiting, i finally have a WORKING version of  urlLink CS .  Let me tell you the story of my obsession.    It all started back in grade 9.  Ahh yes, the carefree days, nothing to worry about, no one to worry about, just fun.  Some of the kids in my class brought laptops to school (before i got mine) and what they would do with them in class is play some CS.  It was free on  urlLink Steam , as a beta back then.  But unfortunately, i still had 56k then, so not only couldn't i update CS, i wouldn't be able to play without significant lag.  I vowed that when I got a laptop, i would have CS working on it, and i would play at school on the fibre connection.    Well, when i got my  urlLink laptop  (Christmas 2003 - the one on the website has a Athlon XP, mine has a P4) Steam had turned into a pay service.  I didn't have the cash to pay for a Valve product to play CS, so i sort of gave up on it.  Then, back in May, my friend found out a certain CD Key string that you could use to get into Steam.  The string was 3333-33333-3333, and we would just change the last 2 numbers. I got it to work for about 1 day, and then my CD Key was found to be fake, so it was canceled.    Really wanting to play CS, i bought DoD for $24.99, not bad if i do say so myself.  I launched Steam when i first opened the box, put in the key, and everything started working fine.  I had finished updating the main CS file, but when i went to play, it wouldn't let me join servers.  At this time, i didn't know about the 'auto-update' function.    When i got home last night, i brought with me a CD with the Steam CS cache.  I installed that this morning, but when i went to check the properties of the game, it said 'Not Ready'.  I waited for the % counter to go to 100% (because 100% usually means done) and launched CS.  To my amazement it actually worked.  Well, i played, and i sucked.  CS is by no means the same as DoD.    In my opinion, i think DoD is better.  Even though you get recoil, the guns are still more accurate.  And in the servers that i play in DoD, everyone voice chats, and thats fun.  I guess i'll just stick to what i like the most.  Lates

      Yeah, i'm back.  Par-tay was great!  I had so much fun!    This year was different from most years.  Most years, we play a lot of video games.  This year, we didn't.  We mostly watched movies.  Some of the titles include:  Once upon a time in Mexico, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, The Nutty Professor, Bruce Almighty, Billy Madison, Happy Gillmore, Meet the Parents, The Last Samurai, and 2 Fast 2 Furious.  We also went to see The day after tomorrow. All good movies.  We also swam a lot in my friends pool.  It was great, because a lot of the day was hot.     But it wasn't all fun times.  On the second day, we were outside playing hockey (also watching Gr. 12 graduates across the street.  Some of the dresses were nice ~_^) and i tripped and fell, to scrape my knee badly. At first, it was nothing, i didn't even notice it was bleeding down my leg.  I fell, then got back up and ran after the ball.  No big deal, then.  I checked it a little while later, and found that it had successfully soaked the knee of my shorts in blood.  So, i went in the house, and cleaned it off, got a bandaid and some cream, and it felt better for a while.    The day after, it got really stiff.  As it is now, i can hardly bend it without some pain.  It feels as if all the skin on the whole leg has been pulled tight, and whenever i try to bend it, it feels as if the knee is going to pop out of the skin.   On a better note, this morning, i found 'Beyond Good & Evil' at Walmart for an expensive price of $14.98.  I just couldn't resist, and everying i've heard about that game was good, so i bought it.  And the reviews were right, it's an amazing game!  I especially like the music.  Sort of a celtic vibe to it... reminds me of Ireland.  ^_^  Anyways, that was my party experience.  Not the wildest of times, but we had fun.  Oh ya, we also watched lots of Jerry Springer and Maury.  It's really fun making fun of the people who come on those shows.  Lates

      Yes, you guessed right, i'm going to be partying all next week!  A whole week of fun, after a hard school year.  Lets you wind down and relax.  Video games, TV, food, fun... man, this week is going to be so great!  I can't wait for it to start.  Also, that means no piano for me either!    That also means that i'm going to be missing playing DoD, major sux0rz to that, but i'll be having fun playing 'non-online games'.... they still make those?  Hmmmm, i'll be taking in some Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles multiplayer, and some 007 Nightfire multiplayer, and some SSBM multiplayer, and some Soul Calibur 2 multiplayer, and maybe some other multiplayer on the side.    Another great game i get to play would be  urlLink Far Cry .  That game looks really amazing, and the funny part is it came out of nowhere.  I hadn't even heard of the developer 'Crytek' before.  But it is also published by Ubisoft, and they made Splinter Cell, whis is one of the best games ever in my opinion.    Speaking of Splinter Cell, the new  urlLink Pandora Tomorrow  has just come out on PS2.  I am deffinately excited... the best looking part is the multiplayer!  Think, two different engines being used to create a unique sense of gameplay.  Thats pretty amazing!  I must get that.  I'll be having fun for these next few days.  Lates

      Well, as you can probably tell, i am a total DoD junkie.  I play every minute i'm not doing something that doesn't require the computer. This morning, since i had nothing better to do, i decided to take in a few rounds.  The verdict: i ruled!  I play on the  urlLink WKA clan server , which has some pretty hardcore players on it.  The map then was dod_flash, and considering, thats my favourite map in the whole game.  My score was 31 for 29.  Pretty good... i kept my head above water.    Then, i went back in about 30 mins ago.  The verdict: i completely sucked. The map was dod_chemille... one of the worst maps possible in the game.  My final score was about 14 for 27.... not good at all.  I sunk.   The WKA clannies are all pretty cool, they all voice chat all the time.  I just enjoy listening to them talk.  I someday hope to be in WKA, if i'm ever that good. Currently i'm -[clanless]- as my nick puts it.    If your ever in the game, and you just got fragged by -[clanless]- Jenova, you'll know thats me.  Look out for when i become WKA Jenova, because then, you'll have no chance.    Lates

      Alright, so I'm a subscriber to  urlLink Sympatico DSL Basic .  Cheep, semi-fast internet service.  It goes at about 125.9 kbps, average speed, and faster than 56k.  Did i say cheep?  Well, it seems like they have been billing us 62 dollars each time we have been billed.  The standing price is supposed to be around 24 dollars a month.  Where is all the extra cost comming from?  Could they bill us for two months at a time, plus tax?  I'm not sure, but if it was two months at a time, it would come out to around 57 dollars ($50 + $7 tax).  That still misses around $5.  Could they be charging me extra for using too much bandwidth?  I'm not sure.  I don't seem to remember downloading too much, or using the internet too much. Heck, for the whole time i've been using it, i haven't even been home for half of the day.  Quite frankly, i've quite puzzled, and I'm not sure what to think.  I do like the service, its dependable, you get a free e-mail account, of which i use, and the modem looks pretty cool (eye candy, lol).  But this bill is a bit much.  I know i don't pay for it personally, but i would still like to know where it's comming from.  This is quite frusterating.  Lates

      One thing you do not want to do: mess around with HTML in the morning...  and I've just learned that the hard way.    Looking through endless pages of br's and td's and headers's is not the best thing to do when you first get up. It sort of scrambles your brain for the rest of the day.  Just thinking about it, i see that it was a mistake.  Well, you can't punish me for my enthusiasm to get things done bright and early.  Trying to make a new template for your blog is also a mistake, especially when you are doing it in the morning.  Since it doesn't work like HTML you make yourself in notepad (adding pictures using the directory on your hard drive), it can be a bit frusterating. Especially when you are looking at a really got template, and you are like 'heyyy, i want mine to look like that'.  You can't just rip the person off, thats stealing, but if you try to make your own, it never looks as good, even if you have high ideals.  Well, enough of trying to make a new template, i've had it!  Heh... given up again, not unlike so many gentoo install attepts.    Speaking about gentoo, i just got the 97 page installation guide!  Thats right, 97 pages... of stuff.  Yeah, i don't even know whats in there, i have barily read the first three paragraphs, considering i haven't downloaded a live cd of gentoo yet.  And about that, i'm not even sure which computer it's going to go on...  my desktop deffinately not, it has too much important stuff that i don't want to get rid of.  My laptop, a much more worthy choice, although, i really don't feel up to formating it... windows is working great.  My other desktop (p2 256 MHz) is not what you call 'top of the line'... far from it.  Plus, if i use the minimal live cd, i won't be able to do anything on that computer anyways... no internet access.    Too bad... so sad... and all these choices are presenting themselves to me.  Should i acutally try linux, once more, or should i just stick with XP, what i know well.  It's always good to learn new things, and linux would be a new thing for me... but its also good to stick with what you know, and i know XP very well.  I should know XP, i've been using it for about 2 years.  One of the first who got it!    I might as well look into linux some more, or maybe i'll relax with some anime... the choices..

      Getting started...    Hard thing to do, when your mind is empty.  Thats how i feel now.. nothing to say.   Summer vacation starts for me today. Serve week is finally over, no more cleaning up garbage for this year!  It was especially bad today, considering that it was raining hard, and my whole group got soaked.    What am i going to do this summer?  I have a few plans, but i don't know how this is going to turn out.  I want to install some distro of  urlLink linux  on my laptop.  That is basicly my first priority.  Researching what distro is the hard part.    I sort of wanted to work as well, but it seems like i can't find a job. I applied for one a while ago, but i haven't got a call from them yet, so it looks like i'm out of luck for this summer.    My parents won't like the idea of me sitting in front of my computer screen for the whole summer, but that seems like what i'm going to be doing.  Just watching anime, working on my linux plans, and maybe a little  urlLink DoD .  On the subject of DoD, i must say that that game is really amazing.  How one game can keep my mind occupied for over 2 hours is incredible.  I actually found some servers that i really like today, good map rotation!  The thing about that game is that it tries to be realisitic with the weapons.  It makes it all the better when you actually kill someone.  ^_^  Ever want all your music at your finger tips?  No, this is not another advertisement for the illusive  urlLink iPod .  I was referring to the fact that i ripped all the music i had on cd to my hard drive.  Now, i have what i call my 'Ultimate Playlist', full with 223 tracks.  Wow, thats a lot... for me atleast. Think of it, my entire music collection... only 223 tracks. I'm not into music much, i guess. 'Rots your brain' as the old people say.    Lates

      Well, as i said yesterday, i'm borrowing Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes for Gamecube, and while i got it yesterday, i bairly played it.  Today, on the otherhand was different.  I played quite a bit, and i've gotten pretty far.      Well, yesterday, i played through to Revolver Ocelot (and when trying to beat him on Boss Survival, died about 8 times from killing Baker), and then we went to see Supremacy.  So, i asked if i could borrow it, because it looked cool, and i did.      Well, today, i started a new game, this time watching all of the long cinematics.  Yup, all of them up to this point.  Every word.  Even answering the dumb calls that say "Press the Action Button to climb up and down ladders".  Yes, i know stupid things, but i did answer every call.      Some things that i got stuck on: Where to find Meryl's frequency.  The tip was "look on the back of the package".  I check my inventory... no package.  I back track through out the game... no package.  Check gamefaqs (after about 20 mins of searching): it was on the back of the game box... i never thought of looking outside the game.  Also, finding my way out of the main tank depot.  Never thought of using my cigs.  ^_^  Brillant tip from Nastasha.      Well, where i am now is right after beating Ninja or Grey Fox, and meeting Otacon.   That guy is a little to gay for an Otaku.  I'll keep you posted!    Lates

      Three letters, infinate power.  Why, a word forming most questions that you could ever think of.  "Why does this song have to suck so much?!" "Why do i have to do the dishes again tonight!?" "Why can't i have some candy!?" "Why does there have to be so much hate in this world?!"      Many different kinds of people use the word why as well, from your 3 year old who has just begun to start talking, to a middle aged person, to a senior citizen.  This word is not limited by age, as some are, such as "mommy", even though it would be one of the first words you ever use.  How is such a powerful word so small, and seemingly insegnificant?      You may ask, where am i going with this train of thought?  Well, to tell you the truth, i have no real reason for blogging about this... well, maybe one, but that i cannot mention.  I know every single human has uttered the word why once, and probably many more times than that.  Its a necessity of life so to speak.     When you hear your toddler saying why all the time, does it not annoy you?  Yeah, probably, because he/she is asking why about everything.  One thing about that word, you don't have to use it if you trust a person.  Thats the beauty of it.  If you trust your mother when she says something to you, you don't ask why, you do it.        Why trust someone? You trust someone because they have shown you that they can do something for you without fail.  If your friend is forgetful, you can't trust them to remember to bring something for you.  Its just the way things work.  If someone fails you time and again, you can't trust them at all, because they never come through for you.  It doesn't take saving a life to earn trust, just do little things for that person, and eventually, they will  begin to trust again.      I want to take this space to give a shout-out for a very special person in my life, Tan.  I met her 3 days ago, after her randomly pming me on gaia asking to chat.  I never thought anything out of it, but i found a person very similar to myself.  I consider her my soulmate ^_^ Shes great: a funny person to be around, she can bring a smile to your face, i love talking to her.  Here's to you Tan!    Lates

      Today was fun, and there is a reason.  Today i got to see The Bourne Supremacy.  What did i think of it?  It was a good movie, althought i wasn't as enthralled with it as the previous Bourne Identity.  It was good, but it wasn't that good.   One of the things that didn't make it as good: very little dialogue.  The story was mostly Bourne running away from an enemy that he didn't know about, for a crime he didn't commit.  Thats all i can say without spoiling it for you.  As i said previous, it was good, but not that good.      Another fun thing was that i got to play and borrow Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes for the Gamecube.  Now thats a fun game ^_^  Gotta love solid snake, and his cool matrix moves.  And you also have to love that he knocks guys out when he rolls into them ^_^ Great for tight spots.    Well, thats all i can say for now, my mind has gone blank!    Lates

      ******** Warning **********  This post will be heavier than some other posts on this blog  Viewer discression is advised.  **************************         Lets start off with one thought.  What are problems?  Again, i turn to my trusted friend, dictionary.com.  The dictionary deffinition of problems is:    prob·lem  2.  A situation, matter, or person that presents perplexity or difficulty:  was having problems breathing; considered the main problem to be his boss.   3.   A misgiving, objection, or complaint:  I have a problem with his cynicism.      Problems are situations that are caused by misgivings, objections, or complaints that presents a person with difficulty   . Ok, so that question is answered, and also what causes problems is answered.       Now, the question is who causes problems.  I guess we all do, once in a while.  Your mom asks you to make your bed, but it doesn't get done.  You have a little argument.  Theres a problem.  You boss orders you to get something photocopied, but you forget. Another little argument. Another problem.  Those are only a few examples of how problems can be caused.  Some people might even have a problem with you.     So, what can solve these problems?  There's a different method for each individual problem, just as every problem is unique.  Like you can't fix your marriage with a screwdriver like you would fix the kitchen sink.    Now, for the real question, can one person cause all problems?  No, that would be impossible.  It would be like blaming a baby for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.  That lesson is for you Gwen, if you're reading this!  Lol.     Problems will always be caused as long as humans are around.  We make mistakes, they turn into problems.  As long as you know you don't cause all of them, you'll be fine.    Lates

      2 hard drives, 240GB of space.  Thats quite a lot when you think about it.  Yet, i have to free up some of the space that i'm using on the primary hard drive.  I don't want to transfer anything on that drive to the secondary drive... i feel as if something will happen to the data if i transfer it that way.      My main "problem" is all the anime on my computer.  So, to counter-act that problem, i am burning some of the anime that i have.  Today was Uchuu no Stellvia... that was like the main killer, that series is 4.6 GB.  Well, that was quite the process.  And anyone who knows me knows that i love to create anime CD "covers".  So i spent around 30 minutes doing just that.  But i don't have much black ink, so i haven't printed them yet.      I also burned Boys Be, Mizuiro, and Pia Carrot 2 DX yesterday, so i have to get working on cases for those!      Lates

      I have found a solution to my xbox problem.  If you have read the previous post, you would have noticed that I do not have an xbox, and therefore it would do me no good to purchase DOA 3, considering it is an xbox only title.  Well, the nice people at Tecmo have produced a solution for me.  Yes, you guessed it, it is DOA 2 Hardcore.      This version of the ever popular DOA series was released for the Dreamcast and PS2, the latter of which i own.  So, now i can enjoy some DOA action without my nemesis, the xbox.  DOA 3 looks almost like a complete copy of DOA 2, with a little updated graphics (due to the more powerful hardware).  There are probably a few story line changes within the game, but since i do not own an xbox, i will never know.      I have just finished researching this game completely too, down to the very price.  I have determined that EBGames does carry the game, will i find it in one of the conveniently located stores, i don't know, but i WILL look.  I have also noticed the price point is quite reasonable, at only $19.95 USD new.  I'm not sure what it would be in CND, but it's not going to be that much more.  And with this job coming up in a week, i'll have enough money to purchase it.  Oh the bliss...    Lates

      This is one of the games that you wish you had an XBox for... Dead or Alive 3.  Now, i must say that i'm not really into fighters all that much, but DOA looks extremely beautiful, and deep, for a fighting game.      In fact, since i cannot get it, i decided to get every movie possible about it!  Thats right.  Currently, my desktop is filled up with little winzip icons of DOA movies, waiting for me to move them into the appropriate file.  Hmmm, movies.      I need to burn some anime.  I found out today that i have less than a quarter of my hd left, around 10 gigs.  Well, to respond to that, i did burn some of the smaller anime series's that i have, the ones under a gig.  Yup, so now i have to tackle the huge Infinite Ryvius and Uuchu no Stellvia... which are both around 4.5 gigs.  Thats whats taking up all of my space!      Well, now back to chatting, i'm currently bored at the moment... considering getting an iPod... yup...    Lates

      Oh how I love the internet and Bittorrent.  They have brought me some albums that i really want, but have no cash for.  Thats right, it's the Escaflowne OST's.  Plural.  Thats right.  There are about 5 of them, and I want them all!  And I'm downloading them all as we speak.  I hope that I can complete it, the one seed that is in the swarm isn't connecting to me.  I hope one of my peers becomes a seed soon.     In other anime news, I also found a torrent link for Ayashi No Ceres, a series that a friend has read, and since she recomended it, I'll watch it!  Did I mention how much I love Bittorrent?  It has downloaded all that is good on this computer, and will continue to do a good job.      I just found out today that I have a job to do for about a week, in 2 weeks.  Yup, I'll be making around 125 for the week, not to bad, at around 3 hours a day.  I get to run games for the kids at my church.  How fun.  Lets just hope they aren't wild.  Well, lets just say I'm doing this job for the Lord, not for the money or anyone else.  The money is just a bonus I'm getting.      And how welcome that bonus is.  That means that I have more money to spend at CNAnime which is comming up in 3 short weeks, according to my knowlege.  That is going to amazingly fun.  Well, Azumanga is calling to me, time to watch!    Lates

      Escaflowne... a T.V. series that aired on YTV back in 1999.  I watched it every sunday afternoon.  A great way to spend a half an hour in the afternoon of a lazy sunday.  It was pretty deep, and i guess being 10, i didn't understand it.       I always liked escaflowne, mainly because of the cool mechs.  They weren't like gundams, with computers that controled all the movements.  They were more midevil than that, with the pilot and the "Gymeloph" becoming one.  As the pilot moved, so did the gymeloph.  Another good point about Escaflowne were the  weapons that the gymelophs were equipt with.  All the zaibach (the bad guys) gymelophs had liquid steel in the arms, that could harden to become a sword, or become a projectile, that was shot at enemies.  The Escaflowne, the main gymeloph, had a small sword that would pull out of it's back, that would become larger using the same liquid steel technology.  All cool stuff.      Well, after a while, the series was canceled and hasn't been on T.V. again to my knowlege.  I am fortunate to have it all on cd, which i can watch any time i want.  But i must say, the movie was so much better than the series.  The series focus's a lot of Hitomi's power with tarot cards, something that i consider evil.  That was one of the things that kind of turned me off of Escaflowne.  Althought it had everything else going for it, it did have that one undesirable element.      Well, i must say, i was impressed with the movie.  It tells a different story that the movie, with the same basic elements:  Hitomi is teleported from Earth to Gaea.  Van pilots the Escaflowne, and is king of a people who were wiped out by bad guys.  Van's brother Falcon is the bad guy.  Dilandau is still insane.  But there were many differences too.  There was no big bad guy over Falcon.  Gymelophs were hardly used.  Hitomi didn't have tarot cards, or any power of that kind.  Van killed a lot of people, and actually was cool.  The Excaflowne was an evil "Dragon Armour".  Hitomi was refered to as "The Wing goddess", one who could summon Escaflowne.  The bad guys were called the "Black Dragon Clan".  Yes, a lot of differences, too many to mention.      Well now, you know a bit about the history that i have with Escaflowne, and you know a bit about the series itself.  On to my rant about the actual movie.      Ok, first of all, i review the animation.  Very high production quality as well.  Animation was fluid, style was used.  Detail very important.  The archatecture of the buildings in the movie was incredible.  A lot of work went into it, making it look realistic and believeable.  The characters themselves were very well animated.  One complaint, a lot of things were very dark, and you couldn't see them very well.  Next is the voices.  They used the same voice actors as they did in the T.V. series, so i recognised everyone, except hitomi.  They used an actor with much more class for her.  Very, very well done.  And lastly, the music.  Some of the most ambiotic, emotional music ever.  Very suiting for the movie.  Not only was in suiting, but it was beautiful.  I loved all of it.  The final rating for this movie: 9.5/10.  I really liked it.  They got rid of all the stuff that i didn't like in the series, and put lots of good tidbits that i did like into it.      I want to use this space to correct my rating for Aa! Megami Sama, it should have been a 9/10.      Yes, i did really enjoy this movie, and i can say i will be watching it again.  Well, i have one more to watch, and that comes tomorrow.  This one i have heard a lot about, and am hoping that it will meet my expectations.  It is Akira!  I'll tell you more about it tomorrow!

      Just the other day i found out about a great service called  urlLink anime crave . It allows you to stream anime from their site on your Windows Media Player 9. Yup, good service. It downloads half of whatever you are watching before it starts playing, so no random buffer times. All good and nice. But what happens when you want to keep whatever you are watching. Well, an enterprizing frind and myself figured out a way to do so, but it's a government secret, so i can't tell you.     Well, anyways, i got a few movies and a music video that i like, and the movie that i watched yesterday was Aa! Megami Sama. Now begins my rant about it:    root@HarukaSoft root# emerge rantmode  root@HarukaSoft root# rantmode    Ok, well, first of all, the story. It took place 3 years after the original series, so Belldandy is living with Keiichi and Urd and Skuld. Everything was great. But when a prisoner on the moon was released, trouble started. Belldandy met her old mentor, Celistine, and he caused her to lose her memory, and transfer a virus to the network in heaven. Thats the base story, if you want to find out what happens, please get it and watch it yourself.     Now, on to my review. The animation first of all. Beautiful, thats all i can say. Very fluient, nice use of colour, detailed. It was some of the best anime i have ever seen. It is a high production quality movie. Now the voices. The version that i watched was dubbed, meaning it is in english. I was surprised at how good it sounded, and also surprised at how easy it was to follow. I'm used to subtitles in my anime, but this was actually really good. The music, it was only meh. It was good in some places, but when the singing happened, it just got odd. The overall score of this anime: 8.5/10    I didn't appreciate the sacreligious aspects of it, but over all it was a pretty good story. And it was romance too, so that was great for me. Well, it looks like i'll be watching Escaflowne: The Movie today! Hope thats just as good!    Lates

      Well, it seems as if i'm back on linux again.  To think, it's been about 7 days since my last excursion into the wonderful penguin world.  Thats an entire week.  And you know the saying "Seven days without penguin makes one week/weak"   Hehe, thats a great saying.      I don't remember if i blogged about it, but i was having trouble with Gaim, the IM program that i was using in linux.  My trouble was that gaim would crash as soon as i logged in.  I couldn't do anything with it.  It was getting to the point where i was annoyed.  Well, all that is fixed now ^_^ I installed a newer version, and it's working beautifully.  Now i can access my MSN and AIM accounts simultaniously.      One thing i'm not sure about is i'm not sure if my sound mixing is working any more...  I turned off all gaim noises, but they weren't working correctly anyways.  ^_^ Everything is good now.  I think i'm going to boot into windows pretty soon though, these linux fonts really kill the eyes.  Need to change them desperately.      Lates

      It seems to be a trend for me to blog about things that end with online.  Well, today i will talk about  urlLink Gaia .      Gaia is not a conventional "game", you can't even put it in the same catagorie as games.  It's a message board system/community.  You post, you get posts back.  There are a TON of people who are on gaia, something like over 1, 000, 000 users registered.      You get gaia "gold" for everything you do on the site, for posting, for just browsing.  With that gold, you can buy clothes for your avatar in 1 of 5 shops that gaia holds.  If you're not into dressing up your avatar, you can always just post around.  But be warned, Gaia is not for everyone.      One of my friends doesn't like gaia because of too many posts.  You can't keep track of the threads you post in very easily, and i really don't see a point in keeping track of them, unless you are in the "Extended Discussion" forum.      I have fun in gaia, and i know many people who share the same views as me on this site.  It's just not for everyone.  Well, i'm off to watch some anime now!      Lates

      Well, yes, i have been pulled in by the net again.  About 4 months ago, i got hooked on playing Ragnarok Online, a massively multiplayer online role playing game, or mmorpg for short.  Great game, very addictive, i'll tell you about it.      This game was developed by Gravity Corp. in about 2002.  Its realitivily simple to get in to, point and click adventure, killing things and grabbing items and leveling your character up.  It uses 3D background models and 2D character and enemy models.  Quite interesting and beautiful when you look at it.  And on top of all that, the music and sfx are all excellent too!      There are about 19 jobs you can be, starting out by being a novice, progressing into first job classes, then onto second job classes.  With each branch off, you get more choice into what you want your character to be like.  And of course the model is different with ever different class.      Sounds pretty cool, no?  There's one thing better than all that.  It's completely free!  That is, if you do it right.  There are several free servers out there, such as NovaRO, SilentRO, AegisRO, MattRO, just to name a couple.  All the servers play the same as well, the only real difference is the amount of people and who is on.      With that in mind, i think i'm going to play some right now!     Lates

      Well, i said that i was watching an anime called 'True Love Story ~Summer Days and Yet~' and i was enjoying it. Well, last night i came to watch the 'extra' that i had downloaded.  So, i open up BSPlayer, load the file, and am surprised....    I found out (after watching the 40 minute OVA) that this was not even a part of TLS.  It was part of a whole different anime called Interlude, which i had downloaded because it was on the same sourceforge page as as TLS was on.  It didn't kick in that it might be part of a totally seperate anime.      Well, it turned out to be a horror/zombie thing, where shadows would detach from their humans, and like humans would turn into zombies and there is a weird firey dog and it would kill people.  Quite odd indeed.  But the strange thing is that i want to see the rest of the series.  It must be that i got into the story a little.      Now to watch some Azumanga!      Lates

      Yesterday was fun. Why you ask? Well, i'll tell you why. I was at a  friends par-taying as the title states. Wonder what we did? Well, i'll  tell you that as well.      This party was a bit shorter than the last one, only one night,  but we still did lots of stuff. First and foremost, we watched movies.  We started off with anger management (funny movie ^_^)  and then we  watched X2. After that came 50 First Dates (Adam Sandler is soooo  funny), and then came parts of Gladiator. We also watched Die Another  Day, just for fun. Later, we started to  watch Gothika, but that was  bizzare, and we just turned it off. Then we watched some parts of The  Last Samurai. Thats about all the movies that we watched.   We  also played some games, but not many, considering movies are  usuallymore relaxing and fun. I brough my PS2 with me, and we played  Crouching Tiger, and Beyond Good and Evil, and .hack//infection. All  great games, althought they are all single player. Fun fun  fun.      Well, that party was fun, but now i have to catch up on lost sleep.     Lates

      Do you remember the 2000 blockbuster, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon?  It was known for a plethora of special effects, such as characters wall walking, running up trees, flying, and the lot.  Yes, quite a good martial arts movie, if you are into that kind of stuff.  Well, this year, they made a game under the same title.  It features a story line that follows the story from the movie, beautiful hand drawn animations, and voices in original mandarin, with subtitles of course.    Well, today, i purchased that game for $14.98 used at EB Games.  (I really love cheap games, can't pass up an offer like that.)  When i got home and popped the CD (or would it be DVD?) into my PS2 and started watching cut sequences from the movie, i was awed by the special effects.  Then, getting into the game, i was awed by the style of combat they used, and the sheer beauty of the graphics. (Very life like) The controls are quite sharp and responsive, although the blocking system could use a little work.  The game gives you tips along the way, and that is quite helpful.  Some of the things that i have problems with, first of all, is the camera angles.  Some of the worst i have ever seen.  I am constantly fighting with the analog stick that controls the camera, to actually see around me.  I lose sight of the people who i'm supposed to be fighting, and if they come up behind you, you're in trouble.  Even with the right analog stick controlling the camera, it doesn't move around enough.  Some angles are just set, and you can't do anything about it.  I also would have enjoyed a training session, not just getting into the fighting without knowing what to do.  That's not such a big deal, but it would have been helpful.    The game's difficulty level is also stuck on "super-hard-in-the-first-scene-and-we-promise-you-to-give-you-even-harder-enemies".  Yes, even in the first scene, it is almost unbearable hard.  But once you get used to the controls, it gets easier, and they usually tend to give you enough health drinks to get you through the scene.  High difficulty is not a bad thing, but i think if they were going to do that, a training mission would have been greatly appreciated.    The slogan of the game is: "Furious Martial Arts Action." and it does deliver on that aspect.  I am quite pleased that i found this game at such a good price.  All i hope now is that Gundam: Encounters in Space is at EB so i can get it for my birthday.    Lates

      I must have quite a good memory. Why, do you ask?  And what does 'Heaven here on earth' have to do with my memory?  I'll tell you.    A while ago, my dad got a very good movie at the library.  It was a romance, which you know i love.  Here's the plot  *******SPOILERS IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF******* The lives of three young people - a rich student, a girl from the "wrong side of the tracks" and her boyfriend - unexpectedly intersect during one fateful summer in the romantic drama "Here on Earth." Kelley Morse (Chris Klein), who is cocky and brash, normally would never have crossed paths with the residents of a small town near his posh private school. But when he takes his shiny new Mercedes out for a drive, he locks horns with some of the locals, including Jasper (Josh Hartnett). As Jasper's willful girlfriend Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) looks on, Kelley and Jasper engage in a dangerous car race that turns disastrous, leaving a popular diner owned by Samantha's mother in ruins. Kelley and Jasper are sentenced to a creatively ironic but fitting punishment: They must help rebuild the diner. Not only does this ruin Kelley's summer plans, he also must board at the home of his rival, Jasper. Kelley begins to fulfill his "sentence," but refuses to have anything to do with Jasper and his parents. When Kelley again encounters Samantha, the attraction is immediate and strong. First love blossoms in the Berkshire woods ("a little bit of heaven, here on earth," Samantha calls the pastoral setting), angering Jasper, who has known Samantha practically his entire life. These new feelings and the romantic triangle that develops are only the beginning of a new journey for Kelley, Samantha and Jasper, as they ultimately make life-changing discoveries about themselves and each other. *(plot outline from http://us.imdb.com/)  Well, i had wanted to buy the movie for myself, because i really enjoyed it.  And i had memorized the title so i would not forget that i wanted it.    Well, time goes by, and i never bought it.  And just tonight, i started thinking about the movie randomly.  I remembered everything about the plot, but i forgot the title.  I struggled thinking about it for a while, and then, behind the computer monitor, it hit me.  "Here on earth".   Thats the movie title.  I would happen to give it two thumbs up if you want to get it for yourself.  I can't say whether you will like it or not, but i assure you i did. Now all i have to do is arange a trip to Future Shop...   Lates

      My PC speakers... yes, they are Altec Lansings, two of them, with sub woofer.   They sound ok.. i like them atleast.  But one thing i'm noticing is that they crackle.  That sort of angers me.  Its not like i paid a whole lot for these, but the crackling takes away from the music experience.    Why do they crackle?  I'm not sure.  I never put them up too loud.. they are about at 20% of their full potential, all the time.  It never gets louder than that.  I don't over use them.  I use them when i'm on the computer, about 6 or 7 hours a day. Heh, maybe it is over use.  Maybe its the techno beats that i listen to.  Who knows.    One good thing about these speakers is that i can control the volume from the speakers, unlike my last pair, which you had to control from the computer.  I think, all in all, these speakers are pretty good, i love the bass that they give (with help from the subwoofer) and as long as you don't concentrate hard on the music, you can't hear the crackling.  Need to focus on something else....  Lates

      Hello 'der, i'm blogging from linux again. Well, as you can see by the title, i'm going to be a whiny complainer again about all my problems.    Well, this one is minor.  I started trying out iDesk today, a nifty program that creates icons on my iconless fluxbox desktop.  They look really cool once you have it all set up.  Well, i set up one today, and it looked right, but it didn't work.. so that was sort of dissapointing, but i'll figure it out!    On a much lighter note, i was browsing around the  urlLink Think Geek  store, and found several cool things.  Especially shirts, like this  urlLink one .  No, i will not fix your computer ^_^.  At school, my friends and i are known as the 'Laptop Crew', and whenever someone has computer difficulties, they ask us for help.  Naturally, because we are 'Computer Nerds'.  Well, i need this shirt ^_^.  Hehe.   Then there's this  urlLink one , this is downright funny, in a sort of dirty way.  Practice Safe hex, and avoid computer virus's today. Lol.  Then, this  urlLink last one  that i noticed... perfect for all bloggers out there: I'm blogging this."  A subtle warning that you might be the subject of today's rant.  Be warned!

      Yes, well, at this point in time, i have really nothing to blog about... except that this would be the first blog that i have done in linux.  Hmmm, interesting ^_^  Yes, well, i am quite amused, and i hope you will be to!    Lates .::Powered by Gentoo::.

      Sound mixing, something that all windows users take for granted.  First of all, let me tell you what this is.    Soud mixing is your computers ability (with the help of soundcard and drivers) to play one sound over top of another.  For example, take using msn messenger and winamp together.  You get your music, and you get the messenger prompts.  Simple, right?    Well, as you know, i just got my Gentoo Linux box running, and thats the 'issue of the day' for me today.  You also know that i upgraded from kernel 2.4.26 to 2.6.7 just to get the ALSA sound drivers.    Well, today, i was using GAIM (messenger) and i was playing some music on XMMS (like winamp).  Well, when XMMS was playing, you couldn't hear the GAIM sounds.  When XMMS stopped, all the sounds that i missed in GAIM played all at once, and i couldn't start a new song on XMMS.  This frusterated me, and i consulted whom i like to think of as the 'Gentoo Guru' for me.  He was the one to start on the topic of sound mixing.    Well, to set it up was quite simple, just a simple script, and it was up and running, and i was happy ^_^.  Now i can play XMMS and hear the GAIM sounds at the same time.  Great, eh?    On the note of my kernel upgrades, i'm actually happy that i did upgrade, because when i booted kernel 2.4.26, i was getting all these messages that some modules weren't loading.  Although it didn't seem to affect performance at all, now with the new kernel, i don't get these messages.    Next step on linux configuration: idesk, and getting openoffice!    Lates

      Well, i just finished watching Pia Carrot 2 DX, and i must say, that was an AMAZING anime.  Its about the restaurant Pia Carrot, and it's employees, but specificly 2 employies: Maeda Kouji and Hinomori Azusa, and how they were loved by 2 different people but loved each other.    One thing i really enjoyed about this series was the animation.  Some of the facial expressions were enough to make you laugh.  Lol, mostly Kouji's expressions, but a lot of them were really funny.  Another things that was good was how they split up the story.  It seemed to cover a lot of time in a minimal amount of episodes (6 to be exact).    The best part of all was the last episode, just before the series ended, Kouji and Azusa confessed their love for one another.  "I..." (Azusa) "I..." (Kouji) "Hinomori Azusa, I.." (Kouji) "Maeda Kouji, I..." (Azusa) "Love you!!" (Kouji) "Really love you!!" (Azusa).  Thats how it went.  Hehe, when they did say that, all i could do was say "w00000ttt"  Lol, i had been waiting for the whole week to hear that!    Anyways, if you want to watch a funny romance anime, but don't want an anime with a lot of episodes, Pia Carrot 2 DX is for you!  Lates

      Yes, i have an ego.  Why i say that outrageous comment is because of how good i feel right about now.  As you could probably tell, yesterday i was very frusterated and angry at all the computer problems that i was experiencing.  Well, today, instead of being frusterated and upset, i just tried my hardest to fix the problems that were at hand, and i did.   Well, first to my laptop.  Yesterday, Windows XP borked itself, and it wouldn't start up.  So, i did a handy system restore, and got it too the point where it was like i had just opened the box that contained it.  So, then i shut it down, and left the XP install till today.  On my desktop, i did many things that worked for other people to fix my nvidia drivers/xserver issues.  Nothing worked.  I mean, the newest drivers wouldn't even build.  Just before i shut it down last night, i paid another quick visit to the gentoo forums, searched for 4K stacks, and found a thread i found interesting about how you could get the nvidia drivers straight from the site.  I figured the files that i got from emerging were borked like the alsa files that i got.    Well, today, after eating breakfast and doing my morning piano, i installed Win Xp on my laptop, and installed about 15 programs, as well as doing windows update.  Well, the came church.  After church, i came home, and finished doing stuff on my laptop (which is doing an initial Norton virus scan) and i moved on to fixing my desktop.  Well, got the file from the nvidia site, and tried to build it.  It said something about the kernel not being in the directory, and therefore failed to build.  Then it hit me, the kernel i was using 2.6.7-r9, was too new for the nvidia drivers, and therefore none of them would work.  So, i promptly started researching kernels, and i found out that i could emerge the latest stable version of 2.6.7 another way.  So i did, and configured it.  Then, i booted it up, got the nvidia drivers, changed some config files, and it worked!!    Wooooooooooo, i'm so happy right about now!  I've had enough of linux for today though, i'm in XP currently, and am researchin iDesk for linux.  Cool little widget/icon thing.  Yeah.  The funny thing is, i got the new kernel to use my sound.. but i have no sound files to test if the new kernel with ALSA works.  Lets hope i don't run into more errors.   Lates

      Well, my linux system is officially borked for now. I can't believe this, so many computer problems in one single day.    To start it off, i upgraded my linux kernel today, from 2.4.26 to 2.6.7.  That sounds all good and dandy, but its really not.  With the new kernel, i have access to sound, using ALSA.  But i don't have access to fluxbox, my desktop envrionment, because the xserver will not start up.  Why it won't start up is that my nvidia videocard driver's aren't their to start it.  They won't load...  I've had trouble with this all day.    And just to spite me, after all this problemage with *nix, my laptop gets all funky.  Windows XP is totally gone, it won't even start.  So, now i have to use the handy dandy Compaq System Restore Disks.  It takes so long tooooooo.  I hate those CD's.    Well, here i am, waiting for a reply on the Gentoo forums about my problem.  Hopefully the answer will be uncovered.    Lates

      These past three days, i have found myself endulged in two things.  The first thing being getting gentoo linux setup.  That has taken quite a while, and it takes much of my concentration.  But, while i'm waiting for things to emerge and compile, i like to read.    The book that i have been reading is the first in the Left Behind series.  When i first picked it up, i didn't think i would enjoy it much.  Then, i started to get into it, and well, i could hardly put it down (unless i thought my gentoo emerge was finished ^_^).    I must say, i was impressed with the book, and i must also say that i can't wait to read the next one (which is on hold at my local library).  This book has left me hungry for more, and even though it is just 'fiction', i would personally say that it is bringing me closer to God, and making my faith in Him stronger.  Well, here i go to watch TSS!  Lates!

      Yesterday i had posted that my  urlLink Gentoo   urlLink *nix  system was up and running.  At that time, all i had access to was the ugly black console (ugly in my opinion).  Well, i rebooted once or twice to change some settings, and it seems as if i broke it.  So, down the drain went linux.    Well, after deciding that i wasn't going to fix it right then, i went outside to read Left Behind, the first book.  Hmmm yes, i am enthralled by that book.  Enjoying it very much!  Yes indeed.  Anyways, after about an hour of reading, i went back inside and started up the Gentoo Live Cd again.  Well, the install process this time took half as much time.  I had it all installed in about 5 hours 30 mins.    So, after installing it and making sure it booted, i just left it, and rebooted into windows, where i watched some hard earned anime.    Well, then came today.  What to do on linux?  Well, i started off by getting an essential too, XFree86.  I emerged that and installed it, and it worked fine.  Then i configured my mouse and video card to suit it's needs, and then started it up.  It was beautiful, ugly, but beautiful.  It worked ^_^.  I was proud of my efforts so far.    Well, then i decided i needed a Desktop Environment, something that gives Linux a GUI-ish feel.  I chose  urlLink Fluxbox , a DE thats sort of 'minimal'.  Any of you who have experimented with linux before know that choosing a DE like KDE can take up to 24 hours to compile.  Well, this is not the problem with Fluxbox.  It took all of 30 mins to compile the whole thing and get it running.  Then i installed my login manager(a really ugly one) and was good to go.  Well, since then, i have been tweaking my system by getting some programs, such as  urlLink Mozilla  Thunderbird and Firefox, The GIMP, Gkrellm, GAIM, and XMMS.  Yes, well that was all i could manage to do today.  After i get all the programage i need, i will begin tweaking the overall look of my *nix box.  Yes, it will be cool, i guarentee it!

      Well, linux finally got the green light.  Yes, thats right folks, i now have a fully opperational linux box.  It took a while but i did it!    Right now, lines of source being compiled flow across the screen as it is compiling fluxbox, my Desktop Environment of choice.  ^_^ I'm just so happy at the moment, i think i'm going to shed a little tear.  It has taken me almost a year to hear about linux, learn about linux, start trying to install linux, and then finally install it!  Yes, i remember watching a friend in the computer lab using a console talking to his linux box at home. I remember asking him what it was, and i remember his reply 'Linux'.  What a great word.  Music to my ears.  I'll let you know how everything turns out.  Lates

      My computer is my baby... it may not be the newest, fastest, my gorgeous machine you have ever set your eyes upon, but it is mine.  I have decided that instead of getting a new one in maybe a year or two, i would upgrade this one to my liking.    Well, a couple of months ago, i started upgrading by putting a new 512 MB RAM chip into it.  Improved performance to my liking, and now i can play all the stuff that couldn't before.  At the same time i was thinking of getting a new video card, a  urlLink Radeon 9800  *shivers at the thought*, beautiful card!  I decided against it, because i don't game much on my PC, and when i do game, my  urlLink nVidia  Geforce can play it.    Well, i wanted a linux box for some time now, and after months and months of waiting, i finally have my chance.  I didn't want to format either of my machines, because that would mean losing any data i was to lazy to back up.  And since i ahve so much stuff, it would take days to burn all of it.  So, today i got a new HD.  Its a beautiful peice of machinery too.  160 Gb, 7200 RPMs, all that i would need for a linux box and more.  Its twice as big as my old HD (80 x 2= 160).  I'm going to put some files that i dont' need on my windows drive onto the linux drive, to even up the load as well.  I'm so happy!   Also, i noticed that my DSL modem was getting quite hot sitting under my desk on top of my subwoofer.  I decided yesterday that i wanted to mount it on one of the 'walls' under my desk.  So, thats what my dad and i did today.  It is now safely blinking it's green lights as i download a Gentoo Linux ISO.  Ahhh, the pure bliss!  Oh how i love Technology!    Lates

      Over the past few days, i have been induldging myself in the wonders of  urlLink Infinite Ryvius .  Wondering what Ryvius is?  It's a Sci-Fi anime taking place in the year 2225, where space travel is common and the solor system is engulfed in a sea of plasma and cosmic rays named the Gedult.  The animation is lush, using strictly animation, i see no CG as of yet in the 17 episodes I have watched.  Character development comes along with the story.  As you learn more about the events that take place in the story, you learn more about the characters, and their past.    At the beginning, you are thrown into the story, and might be a bit confused, like i was.  At first, i didn't like the series much because of the confusion i was having with it.  After watching a few more episodes, the events previous still didn't make much sense, but i was captivated by the characters and the story.  In about episode 10, the events of the first episodes were explained, and finally everything made sense.    I am currently watching the trailer for the english version of the series, and it seems that the voice of the main character, Kouji, is played by the same person that did Quatre in Mobile Suit Gundam Wing.  It is made by Sunrise, a name you might recognise as the creators of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, Coyboy Bebop, Escaflowne, and others, all of which i like.  You can see that they want to express quality and imagination in everything that they do.    So far, i am enjoying this series imensily, and would recomend it to anyone who wants a good Sci-Fi/Action anime!  Lates

      It seems that i have fixed my problem with  urlLink Windows , but i will tell you about what happened to it yesterday.   Whenever i opened a program, even  urlLink Firefox , my mouse pointer would lag, jumping around.  Also, i couldn't click on anything.  If i did click on anything, it would pop up after the computer stopped lagging, and then go back down, maybe several times.  I finally got frusterated, and thought it might be Firefox 0.9, because it is the newest thing i had put on my computer.    I promptly went to the  urlLink Mozilla  homepage, and found out that there had been a new version released: 0.9.1.  I downloaded and installed that, but found no noticible difference.  It was still lagging when i opened it, or when the dialog came up to tell me my downloads had completed.  Next, i thought it might be the theme i have running, so i found a new one... but i still sensed no change.    Finally, i looked at the task manager to see what processes i had running.  There were about 36 running, and i checked all of them to see what they were, just system stuff, and stuff for my video card and printer.  I went into msconfig, and disabled all the stuff starting up that wasn't really necessary.  Then i went into Spybot S & D and did the same.  I restarted, and everything is working  beautifully now.  Must have been all the processes i had running.  Lets hope that the computer keeps running like this!  Lates

      Well, since i don't have anything specific to blog about today, i guess i'll just be very random. :p    Hmmm, well, i just got home from a very long bike ride, went from my house down to port credit and went on the bike trails.  Then went to 'the park' and looked at the creek from the bridge, and then i went out trying to find a pool which i will go to later.  That had to be the longest bike ride i've had all season.  Hehe, fun fun fun!    Then i just sat down in my nice couch outside, had some gingerail miked with club soda, and read my star wars book (what a nerd! :p) Yeah, i had fun doing that as well.    It looks like another day of quitness with my computer.  I'll be home alone for most of the day actually.  My parents went out shopping this morning, and i enjoyed the peacefullness.  I will also enjoy the peace and quite when the leave after lunch to go to the nursery (for plants).    My BT download still hasn't gone anywere... *dissapointed*... i kind of wanted to listen to all of my c00lz songs.  On a much greater note, i downloaded all 6 eps of True Love Story - Summer Days and Yet, yesterday!  That only took about 2 hours, and it was much bigger than this OST.  So, i'm really stocked for anime.  I'm currently watching Infinate Ryvius, then i have Pia Carrot 2 DX, then i have True Love Story - Summer Days and Yet. ^_^  Thats a lot of watching.    I love the desktop wallpaper that i have now, but i think it might be a little risque.  It's such a nice wallpaper too.  I might change it... but i really like how it looks on my computer. Well, i guess i'm done being totally random.  Hopefully i'll have something to say tomorrow!  Lates

      This is frusterating.  I use the bittorrent download client to get all my anime related things, and usually it works beautifully. On the other hand, it can be as slow as anything.  Last night, i started a download for Pia Carrot 2 DX.  Something like 948 MB.  It finished in 5 hours.  Yesterday morning it started a download for a set of anime OSTs.  only 600 MB.  14 hours later, 15 %. Thats right, i was more than a bit frusterated.    I've had the OST download going all morning, and it has progressed another 15%, and is still puttering along at a slow speed of about 4 kbps. All that i hope is that it finishes within the next century.  Yes, it feels like it is going to take that long.  But thinking back to the days of 56K (which wasn't that long ago), its not going that slow.  I couldn't use the BT client back then, it would have taken years for a download to complete.  It took years for a 32 MB file to complete.  I think about 3 days... That's a long time.    Come to think of it, i had 56 K not long ago... oh how i hated those days.  Now i have high speed... if i ever had to go bac to 56 K, i would die.  Heh, oh well, its a convenience.  I have been given so much.   Lates

      I am extremely happy right now.  If you don't know why (which is why you are reading this), i'll tell you.   Quite a while ago, a friend of mine lent me his backup CD's, mainly to give me FMP.  What i found on them was pure bliss.  Sure i got FMP, and i got tons upon tons of anime MP3  goodness, but the most important discovery was an anime named Nurse Komugi-Chan Magikarte.  I didn't know anything about this anime at the time, but i watched it anyways, just out of curiosity, and have been searching for more ever since.   It's a cute story about a magical nurse who is discuised as a cosplayer teen idol to the humans.  When she's not modeling new cute outfits or comming out with new kawaii songs, shes fighting virus's made by a magical maid (for the greatest virus named Angler), Komugi's arch-nemisis, who is infact her best friend in school.  The problem with the magical maid is that she can't remember what she has done when she goes back to her normal human form, and Komugi doesn't get it either.   Ultimately it's a super kawaii animation with a tiny bit of ecchi thrown in (the ecchi just adds a few more laughs, since it is just the content of the conversations.)  Don't get me wrong either, this is not a kiddy anime, it's perfectly fit for older people.   Now on to how i found it.  I checked Animesuki for it, but it seems as if they've "dissavowed all knowlege" of it ever being there, but when i go to the wannabe fansubs homepage, it shows as them still working on it.  So, i go to the wannabe fansubs IRC channel, and guess what i find?  Komugi episodes!!  I'm so happy!  So, i downloaded them and watched them both yesterday!  So kawaii!!  I even drew a picture in Komugi's honour, i'll post a link for that once i scan it!   Lates

      Yesterday i finished watching Onegai Teacher, and i thought i would rant about it here.   Well, lets talk about the story for starters.  I'm not going to bother giving my inturpretation because whenever i did, it just sounded to weird, so i got this from  urlLink Animenfo .     Mizuho Kazami, a beautiful young woman, went to a high school in mountainous area to teach Japanese. However, she is actually a representative from galaxy association on her mission to observe earth. Accidentally, Kei Kusanagi, one of her student, discovered her true identity. In order to keep it secret, Mizuho Kazami married Kei Kusanagi and they both live together secretly. Can they keep their marriage from Kei's classmates?  Well, that about sums it all up, to see if they do keep their marriage from Kei's classmates, you will have to buy or download this series and watch it for yourself.  No spoilers in this rant.   Now, when i first started watching, i was quite surprised.  First of all, this series was not ecchi, as i had been told... well, not very ecchi.  There were a few odd moments, but nothing really serious.  It didn't take away too much from the story, except for the ova, and i will talk later on that matter.  Secondly, practically none of the characters from Onegai Twins were even mentioned in this series.  I was expecting a little more of a story flow.   On to my analysis.  Anamation - Top notch, very beautiful colours, funny facial expressions at some times.  The files that i downloaded had dual language, so i tried both.  I must say that the english was really bad.  The actors were trying way to hard to add emphasis, and their voices didn't really match the characters.  On the other hand, the japanese was excellent.  The music, meh, wasn't memorable.  I don't think i'll go to the trouble of looking for a OST.  One thing that was really good was the story.  They had subtle romance items in it that kept me going... it was really quite beautiful.  I would give this a 9/10.   Now, on to the OVA.  I was quite dissapointed by this.  First of all, it was EXTREMELY ecchi... i don't think it added anything to the story.  Not to the point of seeing "anything" but still, what was implied was pretty bad.  Next, the ending of it added more questions that needed to be answered about the couple.  Did his classmates ever frigure it out?  Was Herikawa going out with Yamada?  Uwah... so many more questions that needed to be answered.  I didn't like it much, so i'll only give it a 5/10.   Over all, i really enjoyed it.  I don't think this series would be for everyone, like Azumanga Daioh is, IMO.   In other news, i got episodes 2.5 and 3 of Nurse Komugi-Chan Magikarte last night ^_^.  I've been looking for these for a while!  Episode 2.5 was sort of weird... it didn't follow along with the story line... and there was a lot of singing.  I haven't seen episode 3 yet... i hope thats better ^_^.   Lates

      Today was the last day of VBS.  I had a good week, i'm a little sore, tired from doing all of that, but none worse for the wear.   We did all sorts of activities today, from a updated more fun version of tag to playing with frisbees and bowling.  For the middler group we always start with, we started by playing a game called Poison.  The object of the game is to push the person you are holding on to into the "poison", therefore getting them out.  That went well, and we all had a good time.  Next we played with the tag game, where you would have a partner, and you and the partner would latch arms and keep your spare arm open in sort of a hook.  Then there would be a chaser and chasee in the middle, and the chasee would have to latch on to one of the other groups, and the person on the oposite side would detach, and then give chase to the former chaser.  Great fun.  Then we played around with the frisbees and it was time for them to go.  Rain: not yet.   Then we had the pre-teens, and basicly did the same thing, only they played frisbee baseball as well, and i also played along with all of the games that they did.   Then snack time came... it was there that i recieved my $125 cheque... the money that i had worked all week for!  Pure bliss on my part!   Then came the smaller groups. Since it was pouring outside, we did all of our games inside.  We played bowling, musical chairs, and with balloons for both smaller groups.  And at the end of the day, each kid in those groups got to take home a balloon.  ^_^ they had lots of fun with that.   Well, then came my "driving lesson".  I did perfect today ^_^, we did the same course as yesterday, and i performed superbly.  I should have my G2 by now... lol, jokes.   In other news, i have just finished downloading all the  urlLink Dragon Mango  comics (best downloaded using IE, if you want to know which comics are more than one jpg.), and have updated my stash of  urlLink Machall  and  urlLink Megatokyo .  ^_^  Thats quite a few comics to keep up with.  Thank goodness that they don't update every day, or i would be one busy man!   Have a good weekend all!  Lates

      Well, the week is comming to a close... it's been short and long at the same time. To be honest, i've had a pretty good time. Heres what we did today.  Well, today was soccer day... not as easy as i had hoped... but it went pretty well. We did a few drills: dribbling the ball around pilons, distance kick, accuracy kick, and then we played games. We basicly did the same thing again with all the groups, except the littlest group got to play find the person, where we hide one of them and they have to try to find him or her. They had lots of fun with that.  Today was my best performance at driving ever. My braking was top notch, and i looked when i backed out. I also did my first left hand turn today, out of the parking lot and onto the street... i kind of blew that one... i kept it left too long, and i almost ran the car onto the grass... its funny, i dreamed i would do that, and i did. I learned a lot from that though! Hopefully i'll do better next time!  On a completely unrelated note, i want to blog about how i am liking Onegai Teacher. I won't tell you what its about, if you want to know, go read a review at  urlLink Animenfo .  I downloaded Onegai Twins some time ago, and i enjoyed that a lot, it was sweet, and heatwarming, with a nice bit of romance in there... it had some elements i didn't like, but i won't mention those.  I liked it so much, i wanted to get the first part of the series, Onegai Teacher, and i did, last week. This week i've been devoting to watching it. It's a lot different from Onegai Twins, but i think i like it even better. It's really sweet in some places, and other places make you want to scream. I think that would be called dramatic irony... when you know somethings that the characters don't. Very fun stuff.  I also tried to get a demo of the game  urlLink Lineage II , but i was unsucessful. I found a place where i can download it, but it was going to take 30 hours, so i decided against it.  One more day of Vacation Bible School, pray for good weather!  Lates

      Well, today was a really easy day for us sports coordinators, as i like to refer to myself.  That title has... Prestige.  Today was volleyball day... that means all i had to do was set up and take down the net. All the rest was up to the kids. No running, no scrambling, no nothing. We did volleyball for all the groups, and we added a few extra games for the smaller kids. My mom also remembered to bring my drink >.  In the sequence of me driving in the parking lot... i did great today! I actually looked when backing out (last 2 times, i didn't... careless, yeah, a little... but there's nothing behind me anyways) and i didn't brake so hard. I had a good run! Getting a feel for the car now too!  Nene, i'll leave you guys alone now!  Lates

      Home atlast... although i had a fun morning.  Well, today was a little more tiring than yesterday, but it's all good.  Heres what we did.   Today we had and Olympics theme, so we played lots of olympic sports like Shotput, Discus, Javelin, and some other stuff.  First off, we had the middler group, as always.  They had a big class, so we couldn't give them all too many turns, but it was still fun.  They played all of the sports well, and i was surprised how far they could throw in the distance throw event.  I mean, i had trouble throwing that far... buy i am "side arm Jon" afterall... So, they had fun.  Next came the pre-teens, and since they also had a pretty big class, so, again, we only played each sport one time each person.  They also had fun.   Then came break time.  Today we had popcorn and rice crispy squares.  I didn't have the pop corn, but the rice crispys were good.  Then we had the smaller groups... they all played the same game and all had fun!  Well, today was a good day for all of the kids.   When we were leaving, i got to back out the car again, AND drive it out of the parking lot!  I was pro!!!  w00t!  I get to do that every day... i might get to go a bit farther next time... ^_^.  Now i'm tired, and i think i'm going to go lie down or something!   Lates

      Well, i've decided to make the next few entries my "work journal" where i tell you what i did this morning.  Well, lets get started then shall we.   Well, my mom wanted to get there early, to get oriented with what shes going to be doing (she's helping too this year) and i guess i needed to get the games set up as well (i was a games leader).  Well, when we got there, i found the man i was going to be working with, and we went over the games we were going to play with the children today.  Then came the opening ceremony.   Well, after the torture of listening to the really bad sounding 70s like songs that were organized for this event, we started up.  The first group that we were going to do games for was the "middlers" or grades 3-5 i guess.  What we did was play "wacky baseball", a game where there is only one base.  All the kids have to do is hit the ball and run to the base without getting out, and then run back home.  Well, i was pitcher.  All in all, the kids had fun playing that.  We actually ran out of time while playing that, then we had to switch groups.   The next group we had were the "pre-teens".  They also played the same game, but since they were mostly boys (7 boys to 1 girl), it went pretty well.  I think the most times i had to pitch to the same kid was 3 times, while when pitching to the middlers, it could have gone up to 11 times.  After we finished with them, it was snack time.  Today, snack was ice cream, but i didn't have any.  Have to watch my diet *wink*.   After that, we had the littler kids, and we played T-ball, catch, and find the trophie.  I hid the trophie every time, i got to be pretty good at it ^_^.  We also did the same thing for the smallest kids.  I think all of them had fun ^_^.  Then i got to back my moms car out of the parking space!!  W00t!  Tomorrow -> out of the parking lot.  I was born behind a steering wheel!!  I'll keep you posted!  Lates

      Well, today i was searching around for a Fruits Basket torrent, i was told the series was good on the asuki forums, so i might as well check it out.  I found a 1-6 torrent... but thats it, all the rest i found was actually in finnish... and i can't read finnish.   I also located a complete Onegai Teacher torrent, so i'm really happy about that, and while i was seraching, guess what i found?  Boxtorrents is back!!  And up to it's old schemes again ^_^  Woot.  Now if only the server could hold more people.. it's still a bit buggy right now, but it does have a lot of it's old material (unlike downloadanime.org, who was also talked to for the same thing). Good times ^_^  Lates

      Well, tomorrow i start my job... well, if you want to call it a job.  I'm getting paid for it atleast.  What i'm doing is helping with the games at my church's VBS (Vacation Bible School), and getting paid 25 dollars a day.   So, i work in the morning, then i come home and fool around for the rest of the day.  Pretty cool stuff if i must say so myself.  I don't know what i'm going to do with the money yet, but i think its' going to be donated to my anime con "fund".  Lol.   Lates

      Well, i finished watching Azumanga Daioh and the movies/specials taht came with it.  Well, i'll give you my rant on it now.   I have one word that can describe azumanga in a nutshell.   That word is: Kawaii!!  Azumanga must have been the cutest anime i have ever watched!  I laughted so much, my dad had to tell me to shut up.  It's not only mindless comedy either, it's also very heart warming at parts.   When my friend first told me about it, he said it was quite random.  That sort of turned me off of it, and i didn't really watch it much when i first got it.  But, when you think about it, even thought each episode is a surprise, it does all add up to one big story.   Azumanga is basicly about the daily lives of six girls:  Chiyo chan (the genious), Sakaki san (the athlete who likes cute things), Yumi (the one who thinks shes fat), Tomo (the energetic one), Osaka (the clueless one), and Kagura (the second athletic one).  Not only does it follow just their daily lives, but it shows their lives right through highschool, from sophomore year (please accept my spelling) to senior year.   If you have the chance, see this anime, it's my second most favourite anime, next to the beloved Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien.  You WILL enjoy this series!  Lates

      The question for all time: what is normal? You just accept everything you do as normal (if you wish to be "normal") and don't think about it. But, what really makes you normal? Thats the question for today.  First of all, as always, lets see what dictionary.com has to say about normality:  nor·mal    adj.  1. Conforming with, adhering to, or constituting a norm, standard, pattern, level, or type. 2. The usual or expected state, form, amount, or degree.  So, what the dictionary refrence is saying, is that being normal is matching up with the "norm" or what is supposed to happen, or what you are supposed to do in this case.  Lets take an example into consideration: Lets take a popular "idol", a person who everyone knows, like Brad Pitt. Say Brad walked out of his mansion one day wearing a chicken suit. Soon, everyone would be wearing a chicken suit. Something that outrageous would be considered the norm, after someone with considerable influence did it.  So, how is the norm set? Everyone wants to be like the most popular people in Hollywood and other places that carry "stars". They mimic the hairstyles, clothing, accessories, line, everything that these people have to offer, just to seem cool. Doing those things would be considered the norm for that point in time. But the thing is, dressing up as one of the Beetles would not be considered cool in today's society. So, what that is saying is that the norm changes with those who are popular.  Why should you try to be normal? Well, this is more of a personal question. Everyone wants to fit in. And in escense, we all fit in with a specific group. The goths might not seem normal to a nerd, but goths are normal to other goths. Same with nerds to other nerds. It's where we fit in that determins our norm. Not all of us will appear normal to the person across the street. It's just something that can't happen.  The bottom line is, be what you want to be. Don't try to fit in with people who don't suit you. If you don't like nerds, but go to a "nerdy" school, don't try to be a nerd just to fit in. Be a unique person, a leader of men, not a follower. And if you want to be a follower, don't go for stupid trends that you will regret later, like getting your whole body tattooed. Here endith the 14th lesson.  Lates

      w00t!  My torrent downloads for Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance finished yesterday!   Thats 4.6 GB of downloaded material, and then when it is uncompressed it's 7.4 GB (for the actual install and play disc) and what it installs on your computer is also 7 GB.  Quite big if you ask me.  Not great for those of you with limited space.   Well, i also started playing it... but my computer doesn't seem to meet top system requirements, so if i turn the effects up too much, it really chugs on the CG scenes.  Not to good.  Also, i noticed that the cars in the first scene seem to "flip", and i dont' think thats supposed to happen.  Glitch?  I'm not sure.   I have actually just beat the Solid Snake sequence of the game... it was pretty fun, but the last part was kind of hard, with all of those guards around.  Lol, i remember that from the trailer... snake sneaks behind them, then he sneezes, and they become alerted to his presence.  You're supposed to be able to catch a cold in these games... but it hasn't happened to me.   I wonder what it takes to make snake catch a cold.   Well, i officialy don't like Raiden... he looks like such a panzy... i mean, look at Snake, the guy has muscles on his muscles.  Then this Raiden guy comes along... with long blonde hair, and he's such a whiner... and he calls the Colonel every five seconds.  There's another guy i don't like, he seems to have forgotten what Solid Snake has done for him in the past, and is now asociating him with the terrorist group "Sons of Liberty".  Thats just not cool.  Show some gratitude.  Lates

      Well, i had a fun time today fighting with my cheap emulation hobby.  If you don't know what emulation is, in the terms of the way i'm using it, it is using programs for your computer to simulate game consoles in order to play games on your PC.  Did i mention it was free, and so are the games, althought it is illegal to have any of the games for over a day if you don't own an acutall copy of the game.   Anyways, i've used a variety of emulators before:  the SNES9xW for the SNES games that i wanted to play, Visual Boy Advance (really odd title) for the GBA games that i wanted to play, and a whole host of other emulators that i couldn't find ROM's for (such as Gamecube or PS2).  A ROM is a Read Only Memory image of the original cartridge (even though the next gen consoles all use DVD's).  In simpler terms, ROMs are the games that the emulators play.   Well, i just beat MGS: TTS, and am in love with the entire MGS series, starting from it's roots on the PSX (i tried getting Metal Gear for the NES, but it didn't work too well, and it looks kind of stupid).  Well, i sucessfully downloaded the MGS ISO file, unzipped them (hard, because the original file extension was .7z which stands for 7-zip, probably something very few normal people have heard of.  Massive condensation capabilities.) and got the emulator to play them.  Thats all fine and dandy, but what did it take to set up the emulator.   First of all i had to get the actual base emulator file.  I got that, unzipped (with winzip this time, nice and easy ^_^) and ran.  Next came the configuration wizard.  It first screamed: Playstation BIOS is not detected, go and search for blah blah blah in your favourite search engine.  Well, i got the BIOS, got that working, then it screamed about not having a video adapter.  Ok, got that.  Then it worked.  The picture was choppy but the sound was alright.  I got a new video adaptor.  Video great, sound sort of echos.  Get a new sound adaptor. Video lags, sound lags.  Switch back to original sound adaptor.  Both are fine.   Right now, i have it running windowed, at 640x480 resolution, and it looks crystal clear.  Running it full screen makes it a bit pixilated, so i run it windowed.  Getting this for free is a good bonus ^_^ and i'm going to try to beat the game on my PC now.   Lates

      EDIT: I am actually on the 3rd out of 5 scenes on the last movie of Stuntman.  W00t, another game complete. This time it was Tom Clancys Splinter Cell for the Playstation 2. The last mission was hard... i almost ran out of bullets. I had 8 left at the end of the mission... whew, that was too close. And the ending sucked too, i was expecting another beautful FMV like the rest of the game.. but was very dissapointed... because the ending was all to short and inconclusive. What had i been fighting for all the time i'd been playing the game? What happened to Sam Fisher after the mission. How did he get extracted from Nickolazes palace? These are questions that probably never will be answered... but i want to know.  Next game on my hitlist: Stuntman. I'm not sure if i can complete this one... i think i'm on the last run, but it's so hard... and i would have to play it for a while to get the hang of it again. I really hate stuntman, but i have to beat it... it's on my agenda... i must do it! It might get done tomorrow, if i really am on the last run... if i'm not, it will take longer.  I went into EB today to see about getting MGS2: Sons of Liberty, but when i took it up to the counter, the guy said "Are you 18?" and i said "No", because i'm not. At the time, i didn't know what the guy was getting at. "Well, this is a mature rated game, and you have to be 18 to purchase it" Gack... since when??? No other store has this rule... only EB... that has to be the gayest rule ever. Oh well, i'll pick it up at future shop for 29.99. Not that much more expensive, and i do get it new!

      Well, check out that spiffy new friends list i added!  the possibilities of what i can do now are endless... now that i've figured out what and where i put stuff like that for the sidebar.  I think i'm going to add a mood, most wanted item, and favourite song of the moment or something like that.  I'm excited.   Lates

      By that title, i mean i have completed Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes in 8 hours 34 minutes on very easy mode with the rank of Puma.   Now, you might say "ewww.... very easy mode, you suck!!"  Well, i don't care what you have to say, i am thinking of completing it again, but first, i have to beat some other games i am quite close to, such as Splinter Cell (i think around 90% complete that) and Final Fantasy X (leveling up for Sin) and hrm.. there are others... FF9... third disc, not that far away... .hack//Infection... i don't know where the end is... so many games, so little time.  I must beat some more!!!   Well, for now, Splinter Cell is number 1, thats numero uno!!  The top priority!  Well, with that in mind, i'll stay away from my PS2 for a while.   Lates

      Saturday... a good day i must say. The day that i saw a movie i wanted to see badly.  Eurotrip.  Funny movie.  Let me tell you about the events leading up to it.   Yesterday, i went over to my nephew, BJ's, house. We had planned to go to Rogers to rent a game or two, and right when i got there, i was greeted by him and his mom in the driveway, waiting for me to go to Rogers.  We casually walked into Rogers and found two games we liked (well, one he liked and one i liked) and they were Summer Beach Volleyball for the PS2, and Kirbys Air Ride for Gamecube.  Then we wanted to go and buy pizza, but his mom was in a hurry, so she gave us money, and then drove away.  Well, the pizza place wasn't open yet, so we waited around for a while... and it still continued to be closed.  We got tired of waiting and walked to the nearby Mcdonalds and got lunch there.   After we walked back to his place, we played the volleyball game for a while and then we headed over to his friends house to watch Eurotrip.  Eurotrip has to be one of the funniest yet dirtiest movies i have ever watched.  I laughed so hard at some parts, but was discusted at others... parts i wish i hadn't have seen.  Nothing i can do about it now.  You might wonder: Whats your favourite part?   Well, i was thinking and my favourite part was right at the beginning when Scotty got a new email from Mikea and his computer told him this by saying "Mail fo the f*cker" in a distinctly "black" tone.  All of us cracked up, and then we all said we wanted alerts like that.  It was great!   Anyways, after we finished the movie, we went back to my nephews place, and played some Turok: Evolutions (worst game ever) and some Air Ride (another bad game) and ended it off with some volleyball (fun game ^_^ and not just because of the girls).  And when we were in about the 3rd out of 6th tournament in volleyball, i had to go!   I also watched 007 James Bond: Live and Let Die, and i can positively say that that was the WORST Bond movie that i have EVER seen in my entire life.  Well, atleast i can say now that i've seen them all ^_^.   Today, besides go to Church in the morning, i played some more Metal Gear.  I am on the second disc right now, right after beating Sniper Wolf for the second time.  All i can say is that i hate the lava in the... hot place... can't think of it's proper name...  too bad.  Well,  i think this is long enough!  Blog ya later (that was endlessly corney...)  Lates
