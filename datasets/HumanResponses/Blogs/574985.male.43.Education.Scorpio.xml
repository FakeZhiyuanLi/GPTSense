      Ray Majoran of  urlLink electricurrent  and  urlLink ChristSites.com  wants church webmasters to think more deeply about their online communications strategy. In a  urlLink call to action "field manual"  for online churches, Majoran lists seven questions to "challenge your thinking about how your church media can be effective in today's world." A more thorough version of this call to action is available  urlLink in PDF format . It's also a bit of a sales pitch for  urlLink electricurrent , but it serves as a good public service announcement to the online Christian community as well.  Having said that, however, I still think Majoran falls short in his assessment of developing excellence in church media. He doesn't go beyond the traditional thinking of many online Christian ministries. Majoran talks about developing excellence in web design and web communication, but this all still assumes that people will be  looking for  church websites. From an outreach perspective, this is the traditional, "build it and they will come" passive approach. I wish Majoran would read my two-year-old piece on  urlLink The Church-Internet (Dis)connection  for a different perspective -- the idea of going out into the world of cyberspace instead of expecting the world of cyberspace to come to us.  Link via  urlLink Niphal , which features an  urlLink interview with Majoran  in the latest issue.

      In his book  urlLink  Roaring Lambs  , Bob Briner wrote about the need for Christians to engage the culture rather than running away from it. Andy O'Meara, the creator of  urlLink G-Force , a popular visualization plug-in for audio, is one such roaring lamb. You probably haven't heard much about Andy, but he's been spreading salt and light in the DJ, music and entertainment business with his fantastic products. Now he makes G-Force and other products available via  urlLink SoundSpectrum .  Andy doesn't trumpet his Christian faith on the SoundSpectrum website, but he does have plenty of opportunities to share his beliefs with the many satisfied customers who cross his path. As he explains in  urlLink his bio page  on the SoundSpectrum site:  Many people ask me how I came up with the name "G-Force" for my visual plugin. I respond that I'm Christian, and that the "G" is for God. I believe in Jesus Christ as the Bible describes, and although some parts of the Bible are open to interpretation, the concepts and claims relating to the core of Christianity are made clear and are not open for interpretation (ex, believing in Christ is not optional). But don't take my word for it -- form your opinion of Christianity from the story of Christ, not from hear-say or headlines. If you wanted a thorough understanding of a movie, you wouldn't consult critics or friends -- you'd go see the movie for yourself. I don't deny that many that have claimed to be Christian have done terrible things, but I offer that their Christianity stopped at their claims. Just because I claim that I'm a girl scout and that I like to bite the heads off chickens doesn't mean that I *am* a girl scout, nor does it mean that *real* girl scouts endorse chicken-head-biting. It's just that headlines like, "Girl Scouts Endorse Poultry Cruelty" sell well on newsstands. A person that claims to be Christian, wears a crucifix, or attends church doesn't mean that person is on a walk with God at all, so beware of who you're letting speak on the behalf of Christianity.  urlLink Who is Jesus Christ  is [a] site that describes the nuts and bolts of Christianity, presenting the story of Christ as well as answers to tough questions. It's maintained by an international and non-denominational Christian organization called Campus Crusade for Christ and has student chapters at most colleges and universities.  So there you have Andy O'Meara's approach to e-vangelism. It's nothing overt or heavy-handed -- in fact, it isn't too easy to find Andy's bio from the recently revamped SoundSpectrum site. But it's a concise, honest approach to sharing the faith with hundreds of G-Force and Whitecap fans. And O'Meara, by developing a product worth using and talking about, probably has more credibility to share his faith among visualization plug-in fans than many online "ministers."  G-Force began as freeware, and is still offered for free to the online world, but an upgrade to G-Force Gold is available for only $10. I'm a big fan of G-Force. I use an old version as a visualization tool for an old version of  urlLink Winamp  (note to self: upgrade both), and I've been very happy with the software's performance. The software works with other media players as well, and even some big-time musicians -- like Michael W. Smith -- have used the plug-in (see the  urlLink Summer 2004  entry at MusicSpectrum's news page).  So, if you'd like to support a "roaring lamb" who is quietly yet effectively being a witness in cyberspace, give Andy O'Meara's products a try.

None of the items posted on this blog are getting to the RSS feed, for some reason. I've contacted Blogger support for some help but haven't heard back yet. So I'm appealing to the blogosphere.

      Kill the fatted calf, somebody! Wayward blogger  urlLink Todd Hunter , voted by someone as  urlLink the worst blogger of 2003  for his lack of blogging consistency, has found his way home. But he's had a busy year on several fronts and should get an excused absence from the blogosphere. Todd now leads  urlLink Alpha USA  and articulates some great ideas about making the Christian faith relevant to the world. I met Todd Hunter at  urlLink Search Party 2002 , during which time he shared some great stuff. I hope he'll continue to share his thoughts on his new weblog.  And for those interested about his plans for AlphaUSA, here's an interview from  urlLink Off the Map .  Link via  urlLink Charlie Wear .

      New research from  urlLink The Barna Group  "examines how far adults are willing to inject the Christian faith into the nation’s culture." The survey asked for opinions about six possible changes in U.S. public policy -- from removing "in God we trust" from coinage to teaching creationism in public schools -- and found that "tens of millions of Americans ... would go as far as supporting a constitutional amendment to declare Christianity the official faith of the United States."  I'm not sure what to make of that. The idea of decreeing an official faith in such a pluralistic culture bothers me, to say the least. But once again, Barna has uncovered some interesting angles about how we Americans practice and think -- or don't think -- about our faith.  Link via  urlLink YouthSpecialties .

      Michelle at  urlLink Dialog: Breaking the Bubble  links to a recent research paper about how teens between the ages of 13-17 create their identities and express themselves online. The study focuses on gender differences, but concludes: "there are more gender similarities than differences in blog use." In general, however, males tend to use emoticons in their posts more often than females, reveal their geographical location more often, and "use a more active and resolute language than females." Also, gay males are more likely to express their homosexuality via their blogs than females.  What does all this mean for those involved in online ministry? Perhaps this study can help those of us who strive to reach young people better understand how they project themselves into this online realm.  The author, David Huffaker of Georgetown University, posts the  urlLink complete research paper (PDF)  online.

      Corporate giants are taking a cue from the bloggers among them and using weblogs to strengthen customer relationships. And once again we in the church have much to learn form the private sector "evangelists."  From  urlLink a Wired News report :  The promise of blogs, wikis and social networks to upend business as usual was on display at a high-powered conference Friday (July 23), when blogging software company Six Apart and evangelists from Microsoft co-chaired a panel detailing how these tools lead to better customer relationships.   In something of a throwback to the halcyon days of the Internet boom, the  urlLink BlogOn 2004  conference, held Thursday and Friday in Berkeley, California, stressed how the latest in Internet technologies -- such as social networks and syndication technologies -- are starting to revolutionize life on the Internet and outside it.  And from the BlogOn blog, a related post on  urlLink why RSS is relevant . (Which reminds me: I need to set up an RSS feed for this blog post haste. Sorry for the delay.)

      The coming generation of theologians will start out as bloggers, says  urlLink Dan Hughes . They will be "schooled in global-reach pontification, in flame wars and public reconciliation. They will know how it feels to be wrong in a very open way and will be well versed in admitting to it. ... these new theologians will not be content with restating the given truths of a bygone era nor, certainly, the cosmologies, philosophies or economies of power that these language worlds of the past came to dominance within. an explosion of nuanced thinking around the myriad details of existence will be felt as the voices of a million empowered perspectives articulate a new network of worlds no less foreign to us now than our's would be to those who labored in Calvin's Geneva, Muhammad's Medina or Augustine's Hippo." ( urlLink Entire post .)  Hmmmmm. Stuff to ponder. I posted about this last week on  urlLink bloggedy blog , and a few people found it worth discussing briefly in the comments section there. But I thought a reader or two over here might find it worth pondering, too.

      The online world provides fertile soil for a wide array of new religious movements, especially  urlLink wiccan and neo-pagan beliefs . In this article, John W. Morehead of  urlLink Watchman Fellowship  points out that missions organizations have done a good job creating strategies to reach the world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and folk and tribal religions, but have done little to reach practitioners of these newer belief systems.  "[D]espite the continued growth and impact of these global groups and movements," writes Morehead, "little serious, concentrated missionary effort has been undertaken by evangelicals to reach this mission field." And those efforts have often been unproductive because of their focus on countering "cults." Most of those efforts "have focused on apologetic refutation of a given group’s doctrine as heresy in contrast to Christian orthodoxy. While an emphasis upon fidelity to biblical orthodoxy is important in order to establish clear doctrinal boundaries for the Christian community (1 Pet. 3:15; Jude 3), it might be argued that 'counter-cult' community's use of apologetic refutation as a model for evangelism has been largely unsuccessful."  Alas, far too often we attempt to replicate those same unsuccessful efforts in the online mission field. Morehead's excellent article, though a bit cerebral, offers an alternative way of looking at ministry to those involved with new religions.  Link via  urlLink The Ooze .

      Behold, the old website has passed away. Behold, all things e-vangelism.com have become new.  After months of posing as a faux weblog, the e-vangelism.com website has finally joined the ranks of real blogs. Now powered through the wonders of  urlLink blogger , this site will feature all the latest news and links pertaining to the subject of online evangelism. This new approach to personal publishing also will replace the  urlLink Good News Bulletin  newsletter that I published from 1999-2003.  I'm looking forward to getting back into the swing of things again with this relaunch. Thanks to all the faithful GNB readers for their patience over the past several months.  I'll continue to tweak the interface and plan to add syndication for this blog in the coming weeks.  Grace and peace, Andrew C.

       urlLink Rob Williams  of  urlLink Campus Crusade for Christ's Global Technology Office  met with a small group of teens and young adults -- from middle school through college -- to find out about how they use technology to communicate. Rob posts gleanings from the conversation  urlLink here . Some snippets:     They use technology for communication first, entertainment second.   They like to use instant messaging. "I haven't seen a personal email in months," said one high school student. "My IM is on all day…one at work and one at home"   They'll read emails -- if they're short.   Good insights, Rob. Thanks!

      In comments to this  urlLink earlier post  about the Internet Evangelism Coalition meeting in September,  urlLink DJ Chuang  wrote:  I'd like to see virtual sessions at the IEC, for those who can't be there physically, to join the dialogue virtually. This is supposed to be an INTERNET meeting after all, right? How about using blogging, chat room, IM, message board, webcam, streaming audio/video, any and all technologies during the meeting, so we can all participate? Can you make it happen? :)  DJ, that all makes sense to me -- especially for a conference about the Internet. But can I make it happen? I'm not sure. I will relay your comments to the conference organizers and will do what I can to bring the conference to the online masses.  I do plan to blog about the conference, but I won't be blogging live (I'll probably be soaking up info at the sessions, and will be tweaking my own presentation), and I won't be there for the entire thing. (I'm speaking the evening of the 14th, and then speaking the next day at a  urlLink Gospelcom  meeting.) I hope to find out if other bloggers at the meeting will be blogging live, and once I find out who's going to be blogging from the IEC, I'll post a list of them here.

      From the satirical webzine  urlLink The Onion :    urlLink CIA Asks Bush to Discontiue Blog     urlLink    WASHINGTON, DC—In the interest of national security, President Bush has been asked to stop posting entries on his three-month-old personal web log, acting CIA director John E. McLaughlin said Monday.   According to McLaughlin, several recent entries on PrezGeorgeW. typepad.com have compromised military operations, while other posts may have seriously undercut the PR efforts of White House press secretary Scott McClellan.  A July 24 posting read, "Just got back from a lunch with Colin and Adil Moussa (one of Prince Saud al-Faisal's guys). Colin wants the Saudis to send some troops to Najaf—so some of the soldiers are Arab, I guess. This Moussa guy sure wears a lot of jewelry. A golden chain, a golden ring with his initials or something, and some other sparkling stuff—kinda effeminate. Anyway, best of luck in Iraq, Iyad."  McLaughlin, normally hesitant to express public disapproval of the president, said the blog was "ill-advised."  Funny stuff. Thanks to  urlLink Rudy Carrasco  for the link.  P.S. Yes, there really is a weblog at  urlLink PrezGeorgeW.typepad.com .

      With your blatantly Christianized website, that is.  In July 2002, a stay-at-home mother named India who runs a "Christian apologetics" site called  urlLink Rational Christianity , "took a highly unscientific poll of skeptics as to what annoyed them about Christian websites." India received responses from 28 readers of atheist/agnostic newsgroups and  urlLink posted her survey results for all to see . Her results and analyses present much useful information about site usability, and caution against cluttering a site with  urlLink Jesus junk  (something  urlLink Dean Peters  also preaches against often -- but apparently not often enough). India concludes that Christian-themed backgrounds (crosses, Jesus fishies, etc.) are more or less pointless from an outreach standpoint, or from any other standpoint. They "add no value to a site and are likely to be as distracting from a usability point of view to Christians as they are to nonbelievers," she writes.  While the entire research project is interesting, it is the  urlLink anecdotal comments India received  that I find most revealing. One respondent commented that he or she disdained "autoloading music; pop-up windows; rants against gays, liberals, atheists and non-Christians; appeals to faith (i.e. the site should attempt to use reason to support their theses); blatant lies; etc."  Said another respondent: "In general, I find religious (not only Christian) sites tend to destroy their own credibility almost from the get-go. There are verbal and visual clues, which may pass as normal and fitting among believers, but which inevitably set off mental alarms in those who happen to be of a different faith, or of none at all. Sometimes these are implied by the general tone of a site, such as one which focuses exclusively on scripture while completely ignoring its historical and cultural context. But often the clues are downright silly, like pictures of a (presumably Semitic) Jesus with distinctly European features, or of an infant Jesus embracing a crucifix. Though these apparently fail to provoke any sense of incongruity or conflict in the eyes of most true believers, they strike the outsider as patently absurd. Indeed, the non-believer, provoked to laughter instead of awe, immediately feels his contempt for religion justified and reinforced."

      Back in April,  urlLink e-church  blogger Tim Bednar published a 47-page treatise on the spiritual applications of blogging. Titled  urlLink "We Know More Than Our Pastors: Why Bloggers Are the Vanguard of the Participatory Church" (PDF format) , Bednar's paper is one of the most thorough documents about the subject I've yet to find.  An aside to blogging pastors: Please don't judge the work by its obnoxious title. (I'm waiting for a member of my youth group to take a clue from Bednar and write a dissertation titled "We Know More Than Our Youth Pastor.") "We Know More..." really is worth the read. And as Bednar explains in the introduction:  I believe that our network of blogs exceed the reach of any single pastor. To be clear, no one thinks they are personally smarter or more “called” than any pastor. However, as a network, we know more than our pastors. In this, we are not alone. Thousands of bloggers circumvent established hierarchies and relate unmediated with one another. We are part of a participatory phenomenon that is impacting mass media, technology, education, entertainment, politics, journalism and business.  Bednar writes in an engaging, conversational style, and with humor. the document is as much the story of his pilgrimage in the online world as it is a discourse on the power of blogging as a ministry tool and spiritual discipline. Weaving together results from his online interviews with several other Christian bloggers, other writings about cyberculture, communication and marketing, and his own observations, Bednar has produced a brilliant work.  Because this is a blog about Internet evangelism, I should point out that Bednar also touches on that subject as well. Under heading 4.6 ("We Blog to Earn Permission"), he writes:  As bloggers, we not only redefine preaching, but evangelism as well. We earn the permission of people before we speak in to their lives. For example, because Googlebot crawls my blog daily, thousands of visitors have read my thoughts on  urlLink Johnny Cash, Hurt, Trent Reznor, and Nine Inch Nails  or my explanation of the  urlLink Corpus Christi Film Urban Legend  because they typed keywords into Google. This new way of evangelism evolves out of Christians using Internet technology. ... This kind of contextual relevance means that I have a permission to interact with a person at the moment of their interest.  Perhaps Bednar's most salient point -- and one I explored at a surface level in  urlLink  eMinistry  , back before I or many other people knew much about blogging -- has to do with how blogs can empower Christians and other spiritual seekers who might be tired of the traditional church structures.  The dominant theme to emerge from my research is that bloggers value this medium because they can participate without being filtered by church structures, denominational restrictions or even doctrinal impurity. We have grown tired of pastors being the gatekeepers of what is important. In this, we feel our pastors are often times set apart from our real, authentic lives and not by choice. But they are distanced by traditional church structures. We genuinely believe that we have more to offer than what the church is structured to receive.  "What I am trying to describe," Bednar concludes, "is a new kind of church created by believers transformed by their use of the Internet. Their so-called virtual life is changing them and in turn, they will change the church."

      Weblogging software is changing everything in the tech business, according to  urlLink this piece  by John Hiler, editor of  urlLink Microcontent News  and CEO of blog software company  urlLink WebCrimson . He writes:  Since most blogging tools are both free and addictive, it's no surprise that the sales cycle has been eliminated.  Better yet, point and click blog designs mean that there's minimal consulting - either customization or configuration - required to set up your blog.  The result?  Weblogs are spreading like wildfire - by some accounts, the market is growing as high as 25% a month.  Weblogs are infecting the low end of the content management space with their incredible viral growth.  By itself, this doesn't make for a disruptive technology.  But two developments are turning blogging software (aka blogware) into a contender for the CMS crown:    A Growing Army of Consultants    The Increasing Power of Blogware    Be on the lookout for more blog consultants touting their services in the coming months. This also could be an opportunity to the expert bloggers out there.
