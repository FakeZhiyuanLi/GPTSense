      A few days ago, I thought I would want to be a school teacher. Originally, my dream was becoming social worker. I was just told that we might have another partnership with a fur-year school for Social Work. This is good news! I might be able to get two degrees.  I run to a friend of mine who is currently teacher’s assistant. Everyone says she is perfect for the job because she is very good with children and she has perfect personality. She told me she would not stay there long. As a matter fact, she is going for another degree because she realized that teaching was not for her. She says it is too much. She thought she would love the job but she didn’t. I was kind of shocked. If she can’t deal with the job, how can I??? Then I found about this social work program. I am still interested in the teaching program. Don’t get me wrong.  I know some of my old friends in Japan are school teachers over there. And they have never told me any negative part. They seem to enjoy teaching. Is there any difference between American children and Japanese? Last night I was on internet and found that the community college near my house was looking for math teacher. I am good at math! Could I be a math teacher? I just have too many things on my mind, and I am not sure what I really want to do.

      I was going for "Information Technology", and I have been taking so many computer classes. For some reason, I lost my interest. Computer is just my hobby and it's not for the job. I will be 36 in August. What can I do??? Is it too late to finish my degree? If I were in Japan, I would say, "Yeah, it's too late!" I won't be able to get a job if I am over 30's over there. But wait! I am in America!! Look around! I see so many older people (I mean people who are over 30's.) on campus. They are trying to find something else for themselves.  I live in a small town, and we do not have four-year school here. However, I found that we have a partnership with another four-year school at the local community college. And I can receive Bachelor of Science Degree in Elementary Education! I have never thought of becoming a teacher before but this might not be a bad idea. I can teach something special since I have different background. I might be able to protect children from the teacher who are prejudice. Since I have two children on my own and they are bi-racial with Japanese and African-American, I want to protect others and mine. This is why I decide to become a teacher.

           Every Saturday, my children wake up earlier than on weekdays and turn on the television to see the cartoons. Since we have so many cartoon channels, I am sure children can watch them all day long without becoming bored. Like many parents, I depend on cartoons to keep my children entertained. I normally let my children watch cartoons while I cook breakfast or while I do my homework. I often use the cartoon channels as a babysitter because we do not have a big yard for my boys to play in, or we are too busy as working parents to take them to parks. [However, I’ve become aware that TV cartoons teach my children many things, some positive, others quite negative.] If parents let their children watch TV, I also think parents should teach their children what is unreal about this cartoon world.      My favorite channel for my children to watch is Disney channel, and this channel plays educational shows and cartoons in the morning between 6 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. for young children. Themes of these shows are imagine and learn. They teach social skills, thinking skills, imagination and self-expressing, ethical development and motor skills. One of my favorite show is “Stanley”, a program about little boy who loves animals and his best friend Dennis, the goldfish. In the show, they explore the animal kingdom, and children will learn to solve their own daily challenges through Stanley’s adventure of the animal world. Another favorite show is “Rolie Polie Olie”. This story is about a six-year-old robot boy with his family. Through this show children will learn how family members work together, share and help one another. I love to watch these shows with my children, and they even give me some ideas about what kind of activities I can do with my children like baking cookies with them, singing and cleaning room to room with songs we learn from these shows, or doing arts and crafts. These shows have no violence and children can spend very productive time watching them.      However, there is not enough excitement on the Disney Channel to keep my five-year old entertained for long periods of time. When my older son started watching channels like Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, I noticed some changes on him right away. These channels show more violence and negative words and phrases. One day I caught him repeating these phrases like “stupid”, “shoot you” or “kill you” while he was watching the cartoon, and I had to turn off the TV.       I was surprised how quickly my son was influenced in ways I did not like. What I have also come to realize is children can also be influenced by cartoons not intended for children. “Animated stories”, becoming more common on US TV, can be hard to children to understand. Some of cartoons are not for small children because these cartoons contain violence and pornography. To make it worse, a lot of children watch these cartoons all day long without supervised by their parents. And some children live in the cartoon world and they do not believe cutting arms or hitting someone is seriously harmful. There were some children who actually tried it and killed someone in Japan, and they did not think their action would actually kill people because in the cartoon world, they have several chances to come back to life. Besides, these children were about four or five years old, and they are not old enough to know the difference between good or bad.      Since cartoons are all over the place, we have no choice but let our children watch cartoons. However, we turn off the TV altogether or change the channels from those objectionable programs. Or we can be sure to steer our children away from imitating speech and actions we know to be harmful. Cartoons can give our children positive effects, but we need to teach our children that cartoon world is not the real world.
