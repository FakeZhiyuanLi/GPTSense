      My older brother is moving out of the house at the age of 23.  Actually, he's getting kicked out by my mom for basic mom reasons, ie, she's tired of him being around. Why, I don't know.  This sucks, for more reasons then one. He's a very cool brother, and he taught me a lot of lessons... some by accident. But he has helped me stay on the "right path" and we spend a lot of time just hanging out, chilling and talking about whatever comes to mind.  Problem: He's taking his PC with him. The good one with the Nvidia Geforce 4 MX and matching chipset... the modded-out gaming/filesharing computer...  How will I get my fix without it?  :sob:

      It sucks to be a teenager.  You have all the worries and tasks of an adult, without most of the perks.  I'm badly in need of a job, but no one is hiring, or won't hire me on account of my age. In short, i've got zero cash and a birthday and Christmas coming up.  Why the hell do we chop down a tree anyway? We celebrate birth and the so-called "new beginning" of life by killing another living thing? What's up with that? Don't get me started on miseltoe.  I know this much for certain: I'm going to end up famous. The only problem is I have no idea if it will be in a good way or bad way yet.  You ever just stop whatever you're doing, and think? I mean, not think at all... just kinda pondering whatever floats into your head... thoughts running like a river that just had that mental dam implode. It'll make sense if you think about it long enough, trust me.  You'll see a lot of rambles like this... this is all from 6 minutes of thought. Get used to it.

      If you're like me, and I know I am, you've probably got a lot of old programs lying around your house. Most of these in my case are older games. Sadly, when trying to run these programs under Windows XP, your computer will tease you and refuse to run the program. Simply running it in compatibility mode for Windows 95 or 98 often doesn't cut it. In fact, it rarely works at all.  This FREE download from Microsoft will fix 75% of your problems. It's called the Application Compatibility Toolkit. Once installed, it works on it's own, detecting what kind of mode Windows needs to run in to allow the program to work. No more experimenting with settings! This program should have been included in the box for Windows XP. Surprise! It was! Dust off your XP Install CD, and go to \Support\Tools on the CD. However, there is a much newer version of this program available online from the Microsoft Webpage, and it's easier then trying to find your install disk, which is buried under crud in your computer room somewhere. You can get it at this handy link:   urlLink http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7fc46855-b8a4-46cd-a236-3159970fde94&amp;DisplayLang=en   I'd suggest turning off antivirus programs when installing the program, as the software makes many changes to numerous Registry entries, and Norton or Mcafee have been prone to misinterpret those changes as malicious script. Never fear, it's Microsoft certified and bears my seal of approval.  This software is perfect for the retro gamer, or for those who have need for using older programs of any sort. There is no excuse not to have this gem installed on your PC. 5 stars!

      You really don't want to be here. You must have misclicked, or went to the wrong website. Turn around slowly, walk away, and no one gets hurt...  Still there? Darn. Okay, here's the deal. You've probably came here via  urlLink http://www.ydkjforum.cjb.net  or  urlLink http://www.mystcommunity.com  . That or a couple of mini-forums i'm on. If you've never seen these forums, check 'em out! Just don't do anything crazy while you're there. That's my job.  This blog will be a fresh mix... my attempts at humour mixed with snippits of my real life. Warning: It might get dark at times. You've been warned.  I'll also do some random stuff, like sharing some favorite web pages, what games i'm playing, what mods for games i'm using, what music i'm listening to, etc.  Prett crappy for a first post, huh? Don't worry... the best is yet to come.
