      This makes you think:  urlLink http://www.globalrichlist.com  I'm in the top 6.27% in the world in terms of personal wealth, however I still don't think I get paid enough, I get paid less than those lazy  urlLink striking  tube workers (although admittedly I remove commas for a living, which only slightly more enjoyable than stabing yourself in the eyeball with a biro).

      The London Underground staff are going on  a  urlLink 24 hour strike  from 6.30pm today. This is going to cause utter havoc to pretty much everyone even the people that don't use the tube will have to cope as all the underground people try to cram themselves into buses, taxis, bikes, rickshaws etc. Going by my trip this morning I think all the tube staff should be sacked and their jobs given to people who can competently run the underground systems.  urlLink Reagan  knew how to deal with strikers.

      Those were the closing comments from the commentator's on last night Euro 2004 quarter final against the host nation Portugal. Although I'm not much of a football fan it was quite a tense game as it ended with a draw and had to go into overtime, which also ended in a draw resulting in a penalty shootout. Anyway England lost and there are a few long faces at the office today. And, poor old Wayne Rooney, the latest English football sensation, is out of action with a broken bone in his foot. Tragic stuff.   Match reports:   urlLink Reuters   urlLink BBC   urlLink The Telegraph   urlLink The Sun   In other news, apparently the Queen is costing the average British taxpayer 61p a year ( urlLink BBC ), considering she is worth £1.9 billion you would think she could pick up some of her own bills!

        'To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability. To describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental. To describe it as an exercise in facile crowd-pleasing would be too obvious.  Fahrenheit 9/11  is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity, crudely disguised as an exercise in seriousness. It is also a spectacle of abject political cowardice masking itself as a demonstration of "dissenting" bravery.'    urlLink Christopher Hitchens  in Slate tells it like it is. At least Mike still has  urlLink Rolling Stone  on his side.

      The English seem very happy this morning - must be something to do with them winning their match against Croatia in the Eurothingy last night. Still it must be only a small consolation after another drubbing by New Zealand in the  urlLink Rugby  in the weekend.

      I went to the  urlLink London Zoo  on Friday night after work. My cousin works there and he got me a free ticket to their open night. As far as Zoos go the London Zoo is not all that impressive, especially when compared to Zoos in some other countries, however when you consider that there has been a Zoo on that site since 1828 it is quite amazing to be surrounded by all that history. Highlights were the ferrets (mischievous rogues) and the bears (who like Hunny). I spent all day Saturday looking for a textbook for a paper that I am starting next month, unfortunately the book I need does not seem to be available in London so I had to order it from Amazon. The highlight of the day was watching a drunken guy crawl down the pavement on his hands and knees outside one of the bookshops I went to, Britain is never short of drunks. The evening got a bit more exciting as I went to the  urlLink Red Hot chili Peppers  concert in Hyde Park - well when I say 'went to' I mean 'stood outside of with the rest of the paupers', however I still had a good view of the screens the I could hear the music fine - even if it was a little distant.

      I've just finished watching the football in the staff canteen and there are some very happy English people dancing about at the moment as they have just  urlLink beaten  the Swiss 3-0 in football. Unfortunately things are not so happy in the north of London, specifically in the  urlLink 'Big Brother'  (Number 5) House, as the housemates descended into a  urlLink all out brawl  late last night. Fueled by alcohol and stroppy women one of the housemates threatened to rip a fellow housemates head off and another wanted to piss in someone's coffee. Eventually security had to step in a separate the battling factions. Absolutely riveting viewing - TV at it's finest. I can't wait to watch it tonight - 10pm iTV!

      I can't believe all the fuss that is being made over here at the moment over Shabina Begum's school uniform - or specifically her refusal to wear the aforementioned school uniform. Miss Begum, a 15 year old girl in London, feels her school uniform is not 'Muslim' enough for her, even though it has been approved by Muslim scholars and the other 799 Muslim pupils at her school don't seem to have a problem with it. Furthermore she claims that, a.) her rights to religious freedom have been breached and b.) her rights to education has been removed by the school (because she refuses to go to school wearing the school uniform).  Luckily the school took a stand for common sense and refuted her claims in court and won their case yesterday. I don't see why Miss Begum would want to go to a school that has a school uniform if she didn't want to wear it. Living in a Western country surely she must realise that some concessions will have to be made. I don't really understand the fervor involved with wearing certain clothes to appease what ever deity you think is in charge - but I'm sure who ever the big cheese is they will have bigger issues to worry about than a petulant teenager who doesn't want to wear her school uniform.

      I swore I wasn't going to watch it and I treated people that did with absolute contempt but unfortunately my flatmate put  urlLink Big Brother  on the telly last night while I was having my dinner and after five minutes I was hooked. It's worse than heroin. I know I'm watching utter crap and I'm never going to get the time spent watching Big Brother back, yet at the same time it's strangely compelling. I can't wait until tonight when it's on again (Channel 4, 10pm!) to get the latest on Jason and Vanessa's budding relationship, see how Emma and Michelle are coping in the bedsit and whether tonight is going to be the night where Ahmed finally goes crazy ape bonkers with his drill and sex!

      Had a staff function on Friday night. Went down to  urlLink Bar Motion , was a freakishly expensive place a bottle of Stella Artois was £3.35 - which in New Zealand dollars is almost $10 which is enough to buy a medium sized bungalow by the beach in Kerikeri. Ok, maybe I exaggerate a little. I see in  urlLink The Guardian  today that London is now the second most expensive city in the world to live in. No surprises there! Anyway the rest of my weekend was pretty dull. Saturday was a write-off as I had a crippling hangover. I spent the morning watching cricket, Finding Nemo and teletext updates on the  urlLink rugby , however in the afternoon I made it into town and went to the  urlLink Photographers Gallery  in Leicester Square to go to a photography exhibition about the new South Africa. Sunday morning I went out to the Brick Lane Market which offers an unusual mixture of every sort of junk you could imagine from antique doorknockers to copies of porn DVDs. Some kid tried to sell me a pair of bicycle handlebars and half a brake assembly. I told him I didn't own a bike - but it didn't seem to matter to him. I felt sorry for the poor person who had to try and get home with a bike missing it's handle bars and brakes after that little sod had pinched them. It's worrying to think what that boy will be getting up to in a few years, still it could be worse, he could become a Real Estate Agent. After being freaked out by too many weirdos at the market I went to West India Quay and watched the new Harry Potter movie, which I enjoyed - even though it was a bit juvenile. The evening was spent at a mates place in Clapham North watching the  urlLink England versus France  game with some friends. I studied the BBC's guide to  urlLink 'How to be a Football Faker'  and was making the suggested comments at the appropriate times - however the token Brit at the house soon saw through me. He wasn't too impressed with the result at the end of the game either, when it finished he got up off the couch and said: "I'm going home now to cry" and promptly left.

      Off for drinks now at some bar near Embankment. I feel bad. I had a random hippie from  urlLink Friends of the Earth  accost me in Trafalgar Square during my lunch today. He wanted me to sign his petition protesting the use of fossil fuels in the United Kingdom. I refused at the time, mainly because I like to learn some background on the issues it choose to support and also because the guy obviously hadn't showered since 1972. So this afternoon I've been researching the use of fossil fuels in the UK and their effect on the environment and their potential to disrupt the global climate, a la The Day After Tomorrow and I'm a little concerned. However the urge to go and have a drink is over riding the pleas of environmentalists at the moment, and quite frankly I'd rather go have a beer. So, if you see any Friends of the Earth or  urlLink Digby the Dinosaur , can you sign their petition for me. Cheers.

      As I may have mentioned before, bat and ball sports were never my strong point, but somehow I got roped into playing for our organisation's softball team that plays in the Civil Servants Softball league every Wednesday evening in Hyde Park. The first few games with the team weren't too bad however the capitan changed my field placement to somewhere where the ball comes in my direction with an alarming frequency and speed. Somehow the ball seemed to know just where my mitt was and bounced around it just as it got to me every time it came in my direction, which made me look like quite a chump. However, I redeemed myself somewhat near the end by making a super catch (there was even some scattered applause from the bench). In the end we won the match, although it was no thanks to any of my inept fielding (apart from that catch). Afterwards we went for a quite(ish) few beers at the student bar at the Imperial College of London. The evening conversation at the bar revolved around some  urlLink football tournament  that is coming up next week. Not being much of a follower of football I couldn't really contribute much to this. However I was told it is quite an experience (even if you're not a fan) to watch a game of football with a crowd on English enthusiasts so it's my mission on Sunday to watch the England versus France game with some of the lads from the softball team. I hope the English win - I haven't been fond of the French since they blew up the  urlLink Rainbow Warrior  and then there's that whole  urlLink Nuclear Testing  issue. I hold grudges.

      I watched Ronald Reagan's funeral procession last night on TV. I felt really sorry for Nancy, she looked very tired and old. I was never really sure what Regan's policies were when he was in power, mainly because I was eight at the time. However as I saw him on the TV constantly during my 80s childhood he came to epitomise the American Government and America to me, and to a certain extent he still does.  Some quotes from Reagan:   "Government is not the solution, it's the problem."   (During his Inaugural address)   "Honey, I forgot to duck."   (To his wife in hospital after assassination attempt)   "My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes."   (Accidentally said into a live microphone)   "She's the best man in England."   (On Margaret Thatcher)   And a few words from George W. Bush:   "I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully."

      I really have to start getting my arse into gear and get a better job. I just spent the day combing through a database renaming incorrect records because the last person who had my job didn't follow the company's file naming convention. Sound like a fun way to spend your day? I can assure you it wasn't. My brain feels numb. The highlight of my day was lunch. It was scorching hot today so I went to St James Park to perve at sunbathing girls. I forgot my sunglasses so I had to practice my sideways glances, which probably made me look more shifty than I ordinarily am. Which is quite shifty. Not looking forward to the tube ride home - but I'm sure taking the bus would be equally traumatic in this weather, at least the tube gets me home quicker.

      Getting to work this morning was a nightmare. The Northern Line was running extremely slow and every carriage was jam packed with sweaty stinking commuters. Some poor woman had her nose crushed into my sweaty armpit - not a good experience at the best of times I would imagine. I was thinking about pretending to vomit to clear some space around me, but then I thought doing so might set off armpit-lady - who was looking a bit peaky as this stage - so decided against that.  I might leave a bit earlier tomorrow I'm trying to be spotted reading my book on the tube - it's the latest  urlLink Penguin  promotion to encourage males to read fiction. Apparently if I'm spotted reading the right book some hot bird is going to give me £1,000. It's money in the bank!

      Today was health and safety awareness day so I had to go to a compulsory training session. Saw a fantastic health and safety video - starring  urlLink Kate Beckinsale , possibly made before she got super-famous. With the delectable Kate in action I actually found the video quite enjoyable - until some cleaner left a spill at the top of some stairs and young Kate fell down them and broke her neck. Damn that cleaner! It was a bit like the end of  urlLink Van Helsing  - Kate got a rough deal.

      I had a super day yesterday. Went out Twickenham to watch the  urlLink Rugby Sevens . However getting there proved quite a trial (largely due to poor planning on my part) - firstly got the overland rail from Balham to Clapham Junction, then another overland from Clapham Junction to Richmond, then a bus in the completely wrong direction to some place I'd never heard of, then another bus in the semi-correct direction to Twickenham Town and then a 20 minute walk to the stadium (I miss my car). At the stadium gate I met my gang of fellow New Zealand supporters - who were not too angry at me for being incredibly late - and we rocked on in. Twickenham Stadium was huge - bigger than anything like it that I have been in before and even though the Stadium was less than a third full the noise from the crowd amazing. We had great seats right by the dead ball line on the eastern end of the field. After many beers and a few opening games we saw NZ thrash Scotland 36-7 in the quarter finals and then have a very lucky win against Argentina in the Semis 12-10 a bit later. In the final we played England and unfortunatly, as much as we screamed our tits off and waved our  urlLink 'Bring back Buck'  flag, tragically New Zealand lost 22-19. Heartbreaking stuff. After that the day fell a bit flat and copious amounts of sun and beer were taking their toll so we all decided to stagger home. I managed to freak out my new flatmate when I got home by taking 10 minutes to unlock the front door - I was struggling a bit with tasks involving any form of dexterity - and then passing out on the couch (for the second time in three days, I must stop doing that).   For the record, even though I have  British Citizenship I will only ever support New Zealand*     *And any team playing Australia.

      I'm feeling kind of rancid today. Having recently moved from the deepest darkest south of London to Balham I was keen to sample the local night life. So hasty arrangements were made on Friday afternoon to meet a few of the lads for a few ales in Clapham High Street after work. I started the evening at Bar Local, across the road from Clapham Common tube, where I met my friends, two lawyers and a guy who 'works-in-film' (he's not very specific about what he actually does). After a few cheeky pints at Bar Local, which seemed pleasant enough, we went down the street a bit to  urlLink The Pepper Tree  for some Thai. The meal was quite nice and very reasonably priced - although the restaurant was incredibly crowded and we had to queue to get in. Still I thoroughly enjoyed my king prawn kebabs and tom yum kha. Although I took a bit of flak from the Lawyers for not tipping - I always (purposefully) forget because, firstly I'm usually teetering on the brink of insolvency and secondly I don't see why I should pay someone to do the job they're already paid to do. (It's a New Zealand thing - don't bust my chops over this one - I might start tipping when I get a pay rise). Anyway... Buoyed the confidence that half a dozen pints will give you, we headed down to The Falcon near Clapham North station. I was not too impressed with this place it was absolutely packed and getting a beer took ages. Then after queuing for about 10 minutes for a round I finally reached to the bar just in time for the barman to tell me the bar was now closed. I've been to The Falcon before when I was not so crowded and had a great night so maybe I caught them on a off night. By now I was feeling a little worse for wear, but battled on and went to  urlLink Archway 635  across the road. Nice laid back place - with a vaulting horse (always handy) and foozeball table. Talked movie bollocks with the film guy, we covered Keanau Reeves unlikely stardom and the possibility of Point Break 2 - 'Bodie can't die on that rock man!'. Then things started getting blurry, so I staggered home and decided to watch the Matrix, (it was all that film talk). Anyway, I managed to watch about 3 minutes of it before falling asleep on the couch.

      Not many people in the office today. At first I thought that I was a bank holiday that no one had told me about (wouldn't be the first time) however a few stragglers drifted in a bit later in the morning and told me that it was a work day but for some reason most of the people who work in my office had decided to take a spontaneous holiday. I'm here at least, not that I think I'd be missed if I didn't turn up. However, enough doom and gloom. I'm quite excited about the weekend I'm trying to get some tickets for the  urlLink Rugby Sevens  at Twickenham. Hopefully our boys will do us proud. Unlike our rather dismal  urlLink cricketers . I was at  urlLink Lords  for the first England versus New Zealand Test Match a fortnight ago. What a boring day that was. I almost fell asleep, I would have fallen asleep however there was a drunken moron in the row behind me who kept slopping his beer down the back of my neck after every over. Thanks mate! I have decided Cricket is a dreadfully dull game, I think I always knew this but my day at Lords confirmed it for me. I used to play it when I was younger, or more specifically, my father made me play it - I think it had something to do with him wanting to relive his youth through me. However, I'm not really a team player. I'm not anti people - I'm just not a 'people-person'. This issue might possibly be at the root of my current employment issues. But I digress, a Cricket match is much like a staring competition, the winner is the one who gets bored last. I get bored quick - thus I sucked at cricket. I've been trying to think of ways to make the game more spectator friendly. Firstly they short shorten the game to 6 overs per side. Secondly, make it a full contact sport - fielders could tackle batters when they are making their runs. And thirdly, smaller stumps. This would encourage the batters to take more risks and give the ball a good belt rather than just stand there and block it all the time!

      I was doing my shopping last night at Sainsburys in Balham when I saw a familiar face buying his groceries. At first I couldn't quite put my finger on how I knew this guy - then it clicked - it was  urlLink Keith  from  urlLink The Office . Quite possibly the best British comedy of all time. I immediately rushed off a few texts back home (NZ) to fellow fans, they were exceptionally impressed and jealous - or would have been had my texts not arrived at 4 in the morning. Nowdays Keith (or Ewan to his mother) is involved in a stage show called  urlLink Navelgazing , which is currently  'in the thick of it writing wise'  - hopefully they'll be preforming later in the year.

      I know discussing the weather is rather dull, but climatic influences have a marked effect on life in London. When I got here in mid January the mercury was hovering at around 5 degrees Celsius (40F) and coming directly from a very balmy New Zealand summer this was quite a shock for me. Fortunately I discovered the joys of central heating (almost unheard of back home), this made being indoors quite pleasant but eventually one had to venture outdoors for food and employment. I had decided to walk to work during February to save my meagre funds and the 40 minute stroll from Marylebone to Trafalgar Square tended to leave me mildly hypothermic. After a bout of the flu I decided to splash out and start taking the tube.  The  urlLink tube  (London's notorious underground system) seemed to stay at a mild temperature throughout winter which made travelling quite pleasant especially when descending into the warm bowels of the station from a blizzard outside, however coming into summer now the pleasant warmth of the tube is becoming less welcoming and more hellish. Spending 30 minutes standing shoulder to shoulder with sweaty strangers is not a fun way to start your day.  However, as I gaze out my window today, looking at blue sky, a lazily rotating London Eye, Big Ben and St James Park - London suddenly seems a lot nicer than it did in the dark depths of winter and I'm sure there are many worse places to spend your day in the world. I might have lunch in the park today.

      Sitting in a cafe last year (2003) working on the final papers in my degree I decided to move to London early the next year to seek my fortune. I'd heard a lot of good things about London, a lot of my friends had been over and had had a great time, some never came home and were still living there. So I decided to leave small town New Zealand and head over to the big smoke. I arrived four months ago in mid-January and stumbled into appalling weather and (after 200 odd job applications) an equally appalling job doing data entry for a government agency. Not quite what I had in mind. This Blog is part of a concerted effort to focus my thoughts and get the most out of my time London - although realistically I think it's going to turn into my bitch and moan column.

      Had a sleepless night last night worrying about having nowhere to live and ending up like the raggedly dressed foul smelling man that accosts me for money each day from his sleeping bag in the uric smelling walkway leading to Charing Cross tube station. However this morning one of the girls from a flat I looked at in Clapham North in the weekend rang me and after making some thinly veiled threats about what would happen to me if I didn’t do my dishes said I could move in during the weekend. Most pleased now all I have to do is get a decent job and I'm set!

             They say, best men are moulded out of faults,  And, for the most, become much more the better  For being a little bad.       Measure for Measure, Act V, Scene&nbsp;i    Saw Measure for Measure at  urlLink The Globe  last night - we didn't have the best of seats but was still a great performance (never mind what the  urlLink Guardian  said). We were thinking about getting tickets for the yard which cost only £5 but you have to stand, which&nbsp;I thought would be a bit draining for&nbsp;two and three quarter hours. The cheapest seating was bloody uncomfortable, but authentically so, so I didn't mind so much - it adds to the experience. Still, I think I'll get a chair with a cushion next time I go. And for the other end of the cultural spectrum, I'm going to Thunderbirds The Movie tonight - which has been getting appalling  urlLink reviews . Still, I have a lot of happy childhood memories watching Thunderbirds and am going to give it a chance. FAB.

      Seemed to be an inordinate number of women trying to manoeuvre prams onto the tube this morning. I doubt this is easy at the best of times but at morning rush hour I felt it would be nigh on impossible. However I was proved wrong as a rather well build lady crushed me against the door with her rancid smelling spawn on wheels. Where to these kids have to be so early in the morning anyway? Has a baby's life become so hectic that they shit themselves, wake up, throw up then have to catch the tube for a board meeting in the city?

      Flat in Clapham fell through... my mate and his girlfriend have decided they are best off living on opposite sides of the city and just seeing each other in the weekends. So I'm back plodding the streets visiting flats and trying to make a decent first impression to potential new flatmates&nbsp;- which I'm finding exceptionally difficult as I have a blinding hangover (too much after work frivolity)&nbsp;and just would much rather prefer to spend the day in the garden drinking lime juice.

Hopefully we'll put an offer in on the place we looked at in Clapham North the other day, but my friend's girlfriend might be digging her heels in a bit. She works in Uxbridge and he works east of Greenwich which are opposite sides of London - even if they can get something central they are both facing quite a long commute.&nbsp;I'm feeling a little selfish about getting them to pick a place on the Northern Line as it makes it really easy for me to get to and from work at Charing Cross. Still, you've got to look after number one, no one else is going to.

      I spent my weekend trawling the letting agents offices the length of Balham High Road and Clapham High Road in search of a flat. I've discovered a friend of mine is also looking for a flat so we have decided to combine forces. We saw a couple of places on Saturday but nothing particularly appealing. However I seem to have unleashed a moonson of sales people upon myself, letting agents have been calling me relentlessly yesterday. They're like rabid dogs, or at least a&nbsp;rabid dog that is trying to friendly towards you so that it can get money out of you. &nbsp; Great, Outlook has just shat itself - like it seems to do&nbsp;every morning when you have a million emails to read and write.

      If you ever call a Nigerian and wonder why they do not answer,  urlLink this  could be the reason. Bless.

      After working away solidly for 6 months (without a single holiday or sick day) I've just been told I am now entitled to a measly 3.8 days leave. I'm pretty happy about that!  I'm flat hunting at the moment and it's not going well. Rooms in this city are horrendously expensive - unless your living standards are that of an engineering student. Typical me, Champagne tastes but a beer budget.  Saw a great article in the  urlLink New York Times  - I'm most pleased - it wasn't a misspent youth, I was just ahead of my time.

      For those who have seen Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 (those that haven't should!), the  urlLink Guardian  has a interesting interview with Lila Lipscomb, the mother whose son was killed fighting George Bush's 'War on Terror'.

      Went to the  urlLink World Book Club  recording at the BBC's Bush House last night. Will be broadcast on the BBC World Service later in the week - I couldn't think of anything insightful to ask the author but if you listen carefully you might hear me cough and shift in my seat at one point.  Not sure what time it will be broadcast but if you check the  urlLink schedule  on the BBCs website you should be able to find it somewhere. It was quite interesting, it was on Gillian Slovo's book  urlLink Red Dust  - which I finished on the tube yesterday morning. It is a fictional account of various South-African people's experiences with a Truth Commission hearing. Gillian is the daughter of anti-apartheid activists Jo Slovo and Ruth First. Ruth (Gillian's mother) was assassinated by the South African Police in the early eighties, her killers later applied for and received amnesty for the killing from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. But you'll have to listen to the show to find out more.  Also tried to see the  urlLink F1 cars  going up an down Regent Street Last night but the event was very poorly planned, apparently the organisers expected 25,000 people to turn up to see the cars instead the crowds were estimated at half a million. I couldn't see a damn thing - although I could hear them it wasn't quite the same. Saw an  urlLink Aquada  (the aquatic car) though, and pointed out to my buddy from work that it was developed in NZ. I think.

      Just went and saw Fahrenheit 9/11 at the UGC in Haymarket. It is quite a lot to take in in one sitting and I think I'll see it again. It's an amazing film and should be mandatory viewing for all Americans or at least the ones that voted for Bush, assuming these people exist. Although the movie is obviously slanted towards Moore's point of view it does paint a extremely disturbing picture of GW and his administration.

      Had a few too many ales at the Royal George in Soho last night with the work crowd, all good fun though (from what I recall). It's good to see work people unchained from their desks and living it up - you get to see a whole new side of some people! I'm going to have a quiet day today and watch Wimbledon of telly - young Maria Sharapova (the Rssian darling of the backline) is in the final against one of the Williams sisters. Then I'm going to sit in the garden (weather permitting) and read my book.

      It was stinking hot in the on Friday and over the weekend and London smells a bit rancid in the heat. Still it's better than the bleak winter I know is going to start to kick in a few months time. Went out for dinner with some of the lads on Friday night and discussed ways to avoid forming shirt sweat stains when traveling on the tube. Apparently wearing a singlet under your shirt will help, it diffuses the moisture, although wearing one will probably make you warmer and you will probably sweat more. It was a delightful dinner conversation. Watched New Zealand get beaten by Australia in the rugby on Saturday morning. I was in a bar full of Aussies and it was a bit depressing. I decided to cheer myself up by buying a new computer. Then I had to lug the thing back to my place via the tube system pissing off as many fellow tube travelers as possible by blocking doors/exit gates/escalators with my boxes. I even managed to knock some poor chap's bag out of the tube door and down the 'mind the gap'-gap to the rails below, he looked angry. Luckily the tube doors shut and tube took off with him in it and me on the platform before he could hit me or throw me onto the third rail. I made tracks before he came back. (I did tell the tube attendant where his bag was). I spent the rest of the weekend drinking blackcurrant juice with lots of ice and trying not to go hyperthermic.

      I managed to maim a girl playing softball in Hyde park last night - not intentionally. She was pitching and I was batting. Naturally I wanted to show off my athletic prowess and belted the ball as hard as I could, unfortunately I hit it straight at her and she got sconed squarely on the forearm. I felt terrible especially after the game when she showed me her arm and had the stitches from the ball imprinted on her skin. I told her a least she would have something to remember me by - she didn't seem thrilled about that. In other news I've got reasonably settled into Clapham, although I'm starting to get to know the friendly staff at the Clapham Kebab House a little to well (I've had some mighty fine late night meals there over the past few days). I'm trying to reign in my night outs it's getting a bit out of control, and expensive - planning a quiet evening tonight sitting in the garden reading my book.

      I doing my weekly shop in Clapham Sainsburys last night when I ran in a friend of a friend from back home. Very random - this is the third time in the past few months that I've stumbled across someone from back home who is now living in London. Makes you wonder if there is anyone left in New Zealand, I had a vision of  urlLink Christchurch  completely deserted apart from the occasional tumbleweed rolling down the streets.

      I moved in to my new flat in Clapham North yesterday. Not the greatest of places but the flatmates seem nice enough and is only a couple of minutes walk to Clapham North tube. Felt terrible all through the move yesterday as I had a goodbye night out in Balham with my old flatmates - I got blind drunk and ended up dancing to funk at the  urlLink Bedford  which is quite possibly the scariest pub in the world. Any illusions I was under that Londeners are sophisticated people were irrevocably shattered that night - I saw one too many sweaty people trying to dance to Abba's 'Dancing Queen'. I finished the night at the house of couple of Australian girls in Tooting drinking Pineapple liqueur on their balcony and listening to Franz Ferdinand. Odd night.
