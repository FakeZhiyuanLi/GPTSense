      Ahhhh, so I haven't been loyal, and this is my first post in a week.... but i have good reason.   I finally got the job over with landscaping crap... so, there i was, puttin up 51 hours of work this week, for an average total of 510$. I'd tell you all about my week, but, too fukin long... lol, so if ya really wanna kno, ill tell ya in person or sumtin.  So yea, anywayz, now im on call cuz im done filling in for the ppl on vacation...   So about today... i seen an old friend I knew way back in Elementry... and saw her for first time in 6 years... lol. We went out for dinner at Cage aux sports, along with her younger brother adam, who just happens to b the same age as my sis, and they have classes together... small world eh...  So yea, got a really good chicken burger with a ton of ketchup :D. After that we hit the arcade for a bit, played sum games and la di da... then we headed over to odeon... aka... place lasalle, and messed around in that arcade until everyone showed up.   We saw the movie "I, Robot" which stars Will Smith... and the movie ends like................ kidding, i wont kill it... even tho i should. It was alright, Its hard to come by a really good movie these days... all so predictable.   Yea, so im already getting tired, but, I get home around 12 30, and then around 1 20, Matt b and Jacob start heffing me to go outside... so they mention Timmies, and i figure it would be alrites, so we go to Timmies, get sum snacks, and jus talk for a bit, and share krazy memories of high skool... we then realize the 3 of us are going to 3 different colleges... lol... kinda freaky... meh  Yea im still pretty tired, its 3 10 am... so im going to bed... ill try to keep up in my postings from now on...

      So today was pretty random, just another day out the house eh, lolz... well, i got up, had shower, shaves, ate... reg crap... then went to play guitar for a bit, and the doorbell a rang...  &nbsp;  Adam informed me that I have a job if i want it starting monday on maintenance with his uncles landscaping company. Do lawnmowing and such for next 2 weeks i believe. Should be interesting, considering the weather is gonna sky rocket up to 30 degrees... and even MORE with HUMIDITY... grr... well, guess it was time for a tan anywayz.... (Mel will luv that part... cuz we all kno she is alwayz "tanning" :D:D)  &nbsp;  umm... yea, so then adam told me he got his new computer, so i offered my assistance to go help him set it all up. as i was gettin ready to leave... my Uncle randomly showed up with a bunch of stuff for my dad, from my grandmother's house. So i said hi and bye to him, and, went over to Adams. First we set up his chair, only took about 20 min.... then we set up the desk, which was really easy... besides this one complication with the bolts, cuz we didnt have the right wrench...  &nbsp;  Finally we set up the computer, and had some complications with the router and getting the internet up, but, it coulda been a lot worse.... all in all, its all working now... so, mission accomplished.  &nbsp;  We then called up sum ppl, cuz we wanted to get outa the house... we figured we'd go see the fireworks at laronde, i mean, them chinease were hosting.&nbsp;Randi was game, so the 3 of us went down and saw them.  &nbsp;  Pretty regular time over there, got a good spot and waited for them to start for an hour.... got sum of them krazy chips, and me and randi shared it, cuz well, theres jus wayyy too much greese and shit for one person to digest....  &nbsp;  The fireworks were pretty awesoem, don't beat Holland tho... but, i mean, we figure china put up like, just as many fireworks in the air in the first 10 min, than, any othere country did in their full 30 minutes... lol... yet, still not enuf to make em the best...  &nbsp;  so yea, there ya have it, we headed home on the boiling hot metro, and, here i am now, writing this stuff for u few ppl to read, lolz, anywayz, im tired, and dehydrated, so thats all folks... (in the great words of bugz bunny..)

      yea, so, I met Darren 2day.... my friends new baby boi.. he's pretty "chill"... lol... I'll have to teach him guitar one day, and i gonna make sure she enrolls him in hockey, be the next Saku Koivu.... &nbsp; So i woke up around 9 30 today, aftger getting lil sleep, but i guess i coulda been worse off... Met up with Adam, Randi, and Jess at metro. Jess had this huge spongebob balloon to bring as a present. We then headed over to Rossy's to pick up sum last minute gifts... hehe.... I managed to find a really cute stuffy dog... soft as hell... and this big green frog... with a really nyce ass (_)_) ... haha &nbsp; after everyone had wut they wanted, we headed to a table to write up the card, and find a way to shuv everything into one gift bag.... Jess then proceeded to fill the envelope with excessive confetti. Being super tired, cuz me and her were up till 3 or 4 am... she didnt think about the fact that the card was near impossible to fit in the envelope with all that confetti in there... so we dumped it out onto the table.. amking a HUGE shiny mess... all over the darn place. &nbsp; We then scooped it al back into the envelope, and wrote "there's no confetti in here" on the back of it.... we headed over to the hospital, walking some of the way... as Jess' spongebob balloon attacked random passerbyers... &nbsp; Then random carlo came flying by us... ... and wouldnt even give us a lift that asshole!!!.. *shakes fist*... lolz... i told him.... "Shiggity Shiggity Shwa" and he was all confused.. and was like "huh"... so i turn to jess and said to her "tell him Jess"... so she said... "Shiggity Shiggity shwa"... and all was right in the world again. &nbsp; Next, we got to the hospital, and had a fun time trying to find her room, going aorund callin out her name lookin into other random ppl's rooms... and, like discovered she wasnt in the chinease room.. nor the african american one...  &nbsp; we ran into our mom who gave us... FAULTY directions... and we ended up running back into her mom, who finally saved us from our haunt for the cheese, by bringing us right to it... and long and behold... there was the CHEESE... sir Darren.  &nbsp; so we poked at him for a bit, and then gave our gifts, and laughed at random crap for about 3 hours. like the "dangling feet?"... anywayz... we left after, and, went to micky d's to eat. Jess left to go home by this point. I saw pam at Mick dicks, and bugged her, and she randomly commented that i "look different"... and i still dont kno why... meh (i blame it on the fact that im finally relaxed and taking a break from all the crap in life) &nbsp; Yellow. &nbsp; anywayz, we headed back to my house so i could pick up money for nothing, then sum cds, and let randi use my bathroom... and then headed over to adams, where we jus relaxed for a bit listening to sum music, we were itching for a party or sum kinda get together, but, it never really worked out, damn weather, wish&nbsp;it would make up its mind..... anywayz.... randi wasn't feeling good, and i was pretty exhausted, so we decided to call it a day.... our mission was accomplished anywayz.. &nbsp; so i got home, and jus like collapsed for a bit... lol, got about an hours sleep, but, nuttin really good, and im still pretty dead... meh. too much stuff on me mind.  &nbsp; anywayz, tra la la.. laterz

      yea, so another interesting day here in&nbsp;Matt's world i guess. Met up with Mel round 2 at metro to go to angrignon. Amanda was posed to meet us there, but, she thought Mel meant the metro (as in angrignon).. and ended up waiting for us there. Anywayz, we headed to Steve's music store... well first the book store so Mel could pick up the book she needed for her guitar lessons. &nbsp; Then we headed into the actual store with all them sexy and   kinky   guitars. I managed to get my hands on a new poster... Slipknot... woopie i guess.... &nbsp; while randomly flipping it around in my hands, i saw it go flying through the air, and a guy was nyce enuf to get it for me... and he turned out to be Jess' bf Matt G!... who stole my name ... *grr*... lolz... jkz... i was like :O... and started saying random crap to him, and he didnt even know who i was... then i seen the other guy he was with, and i remember from pictures that he was Myke... so i was like :O... hi myke... i kno u from pictures!!!!... and he jus kinda smiled, and said hi.... lol... then i informed Matt that i was one of Jess' friends... and that Q! sucks... and started talkin about how G! is better....  &nbsp; After this close encounter, Mel, Amanda, and I left, and headed home, well, ended up at Mel's... they made me watch Poolhouse Junkies... (well i kinda wanted to see wut all the hype was a bout)... and yea, it was actually a pretty awesome movie...  &nbsp; After the movie, mel gave me a may west, and we headed down to the river... cuz there was nuttin better 2 do...&nbsp; but cuz the river was rising cuz of the rain, we couldnt get very far... meh... so we hit the 113, and headed down to the metro. I had managed to meet adam, and got him on the same 113 bus as us.... so we now had 4 ppl to travel w/.  &nbsp; (Did i mention i hate quebec yet, cuz i do... like wtf... i get my MEQ's today, and apparently i failed my french listening, and reading exams... 54 and 57 respectively.... like WTF!!!!... i seriously hate this fukin province, cuz i get good marks in ever other class, but the freakin french gotta bring me down... meh, they better not pull sum shit on me to fail me or sumtin... ill go william wallace on thier arce.) &nbsp; yea, so we met up with sum random ppl at the AMC theater downtown, friends of Mels/Amanda's... and saw the movie King Arthur after sum random walking around future shop and other crap.... (i wonder what happened to corey?)  &nbsp; uhh yea, and the biggest event of the day, was finding out my best friend finally had her baby.... got the call, and some ppl might not believe me, at least unless u were the ones i told, but 2 days ago i had a dream that she had a boy... and i even told hre that yesturday... and... then she goes and has one... so... yea... anywayz, ill put more info about that crap tomorrow, after i go see her and really hope she is doing fine... my mind is going about 560 miles an hour right now... lolz... anywayz, thats all outa me 2nite.

      yea, so, i woke up around 12 to the phone ringing... turns out its alfred, cuz we getting together today to jam. I'm half asleep but call him back, and get the details... im then assigned to call Matt. When I call him, I wake him up, and continue the chain of groggy morning ppl... Matt sounds quite confused at first, but, is still kool with everything, and, we figure we gonna meet for 1 30 pm. Next thing i do, is get a hold of Adam...  So we all hit Matt's for practice, and mess around on the instruments for a bit. Its kinda hard to really practice though, cuz the drum set is royaly phuked up... and I think Alfred is really wanting his Ludwig set right now, so we all kinda pushing for it, cuz, we just cant go on with the one we got now.   Adam makes a point saying we should jus go and relax, cuz, we all pretty dead tired, and just no into jaming today, so we figure we will go to the arcade or sumtin. There is a bit of confusion cuz adam wants to get his amp and stuff back to his house so he can practice and such. so we help him bring it down the street. we manage to miss the bus by like... 3 mintues... STUPID SPONGEBOB... so yea, we sit around doing stupid things, like adam ripping out rubber out of the road...and chasing after matt and alfred with it..   Alfred is running away, and he has Adam's amps chord, and manages to hit a car while walking back, and i can jus imagine the owner coming out and totally ravaging alfred, but nuttin happens. Alfred and Matt then decide they dont wanna dot he arcade no more, and so they go home. Adam invites me over to his house, and we play sum... Game cube i think it is... and its the first time i ever play this system... but i kick ass on that need for speed 2 stuff... muahahaha  I realize that i still have the mark on my arm from when i asked amanda to bite me yesturday, and she did, but i didnt feel any pain, and she got freaked out cuz i didnt... lolz... meh... hey MEL, u gotta bite me, i heard ur worse...   umm so yea, me and adam head to meet adam v. randi and kevin at the metro to check out the fireworks... (its holland today)... all i can say, is those were the most sexy fireworks ive ever seen in my life, the best yet... and sumhow they also had the biggest single firework any of us had ever seen in our lives.   umm... for random crap that happened at laronde... me adam v and kev had a great ride in the bumper cars.... me and kev almost dislodged adam from his vehicle 3 times... lol... and sum random lil kid that looked like harry potter was head hunting kevin... DAMN HIM... lol  uhh... yea, sum random french guy was asking us sum weird questions... so we told him we dont really understand him cuz we are from calgary... lol, said we came by plane and stuff 2... pretty funny.   anywayz thats all outa me for now... prob going to see king arthur tomorrow, as well as hit steves musik store with mel and mayb amanda. anywayz... im going to bed now ppl.

      Wow, im kinda tired, its about 1 45 am, and i only just got in not long ago, so, excuse any stupid mistakes i mite make.   so yea, i guess i woke up around 1 pm today, lol, cuz im a lazy bastard, but wtv. i think today was the most random day ever, well in running into ppl kinda way... i met up with adam v around 6 pm at my house, and we went 2 BK for supper. (today was the first day in like 2 weeks where i had 2 full meals :O ).   Yea so, im waiting for a call from alfred, cuz we posed to get together and meet up with others. Finally i get a hold of him, and he tells me to get a hold of adam D to meet up and stuff. So me and adam v. head to angrignon to meet adam. by the time we get there, we have already run into 4 random ppl (Mike tucci, James bouzelli, Jackie b. and stephanie venture... lol who adam didnt even realized he sat down next 2... lmao!!!... TOO SCARY)...   anywayz, so we get to the metro, and like, adam gets there so we head to monk where we posed to meet alfred cuz he coming by bike, cuz he is well, krazy. during this time, sum poor lost chinease woman is looking for sum eco center near jolicouer, so we send her int he wrong direction, and then adam... and adam... procceed to make fun of her accent. after this, we are ambushed by a random dog (not so random tho)... turns out its adam d's aunts dog, and she is trailing behind it, and then we seen his uncle 2... (the randomness continues)... finally alfred shows up, and we are suprised cuz he has no bike. turns out he isnt krazy after all...  oh yea, b4 alfred shows up, we trick amanda into coming outside by telling her we have sumtin she wants, but when she gets there, we told her we didnt have it, and adam v took a picture of her expression with his phone... it was rather shocked... we then dragged her to brents house, but she had to go change first... cuz she didnt like what she was wearing... AMANDA U WERE FINEE!!... lol... meh...  while waiting for her to get back, i seen my dad drive by... still gotta see if he had seen us or not... meh. finally we get to Brents, and sprawl out in his backyard, and then he informs me he has a hacky sack, so we decide we shall play. this goes on for a bit, and then we decide to walk for a bit, and end up at lafleurs.   when heading back to brents tho, sum random drunking bum... who from this point on will be known as "Richard" with a french accent to it, attacked us... he came outa no where, asking us who the boss was, so i pointed him in the direction of brent. I had found a random handle bars of sum bike, and picked it up, ready to use for my protection incase this random richard went vou dou on us... lol.. instead of going into brents backyard, and having him follow us in, we decide to keep walking, and as soon as we got to the corner, we jet around the corner and leave him in our dust... i wonder wut happened to him... oh well, prob fell into a well or sumtin.  anywayz, so the nite continues, and alfred eventualy has to go home so we walk him to the metro, and end up playing hacky soccer there, where eventually, jessica Burea, who i alwayz throw up on, shows up. she also has her random friend ashley who i met i think on canada day... meh... so yea, once again the randomnes continues.   we finally head back to brents, and jus sit around talkin and listnein to music. i tell amanda she can bite me, cuz i dont feel pain (this actually happened when we were walking, but wtv.)... and she does, and, i guess she was a lil freaked cuz i never said stop... i also realized at this moment that i had a misquito so big on my arm, it looks like i have 2 elbows. fun.   Finally we head home, and break up once again, as adam d, and amanda head home in one direction, and me and adam v head home in the other. We manage to catch the last metro, and the last 106 bus. the randomness continues as we run into adam's mom on the bus. then, kev ambushes me.. and there he is. (this is the end of the randomness folks... of course, besides adam v running into sumone he knows from work)...  and there u have it... i think i might b forgetting sum stuff, but its like 2 am now. so who cares fuk... lol. anywayz, thats my random day all, enjoy... tomorrow.. band practice and fireworks :D.

      So yea, today was random... and no food  I wake up at god knows wut time, and me and adam decide we wanna do sumtin but we dont kno what, so adam says we should bug linzy... lol, so we did, but she didnt have any good ideas either, but who's to blame her, lasalle is shit for stuff to do... meh...  so we end up at linzies house, jus sitting around doing random nuthing ness, and letting spike entertain us as he growled at adam all the time.   Linzy eventually kicks our lazy butts out, lol, cuz i mean she has to eat, and like, sleep, lol... so we go to the bus around 6 sumtin, and wait 20 min for the darn 113... (waiting long time for buses seams to have been the theme today)...  so we get home, and, adam goes to see his uncle for his check, and i go upstairs to the nyce ac to relax, and maybe get sum supper cuz, i mean, i havent eaten all day... so first thing as alwayz, when i get in i check the phone.  turns out adam d. and matt a. both called me, but adam d. had only called me like 10 min b4 i got in. so i call him back and apparently they wanna have a band meetin, and were lookin for me. so i get changed, and run for the bus to meet adam d. and then we head to alfreds.   once their, i show em the band website i been working on, and like, the funny stuff on it. we then head to the living room, cuz alfred and matt HAVEE to watch Dragon ballz again, (i had already warned adam d. about this obsession... lol)...  so after thats over, we decide to hit the store for sum drinks and stuff, and end up with 4 cokes and a bag of italin nacha dorito chips or sumtin, which matt suggested were good... and they were. "sumhow", matt's sisters bike's wheel got popped, and matt went in to tell her the news, and she wanst realyl happy about it... meh...   so me, alfred and adam move on to the park, and matt sayz he gotta go back in... so we hit the swings and jus relax. we start to get badly misquito bitten. finally, we hit the bus stop around 10 20 or so... and wait for the natorious 110 bus... which comes once every blue moon, and i guess the moon was white tonite.   me and adam wait like 30 min for it. finally it comes, but totally at the wrong place, cuz the current stop is not being used, and is across the street, so me and adam jet for it. we got on and i get off at the transfer only like 3 stops down...   i then wait another 23 minutes for the 113 bus to come... and finally get on that to get to my final destination... home... i wonder if i woulda got there faster if i had walked... lol... stupid STCUM transit, get more buses damnit... anywayz, i get off at the stop finally, and run into kev m. and adam... and walk down the street and home with themn... byu this time its practicly 11 30... so it took like a whole hour to get home... from barely very far away.  anywayz, so yea, another long blog for my readers to read, rather boring really, so sorri for wasting your time. but whatever, i couldnt care less... lol  oh yea, HI Mel... sorri if this kept u away from ur lestat quizes... u can go back an enjoy them now ;).

      So I went to bed around 3 am, and woke up at 9 am... i have no idea why i put myself through this tired state all the time... lol, meh, maybe its cuz i like zombies?  so i jus killed my brain trying to get my msn to fit the stupid lil amount of space they give us to write a name... and it turned out looking like this   "The Extent 2Which Im Feelin Isnt Easy 2Conceive Id Like Nutin More 2Ease This Endless Pain&Discover TheTorturer Who MakesMe Krazy"  Yea, i get a headache just lookin at it, but i wrote that in my "When Dark Days Rule" poem i wrote, and i just luv that line, so i had to make it fit.. u can view my stuff at http://psycing.tripod.com/id3.html .   So yea, i woke up, and thought about maybe shaving, but i was lazy, and figured i'd just do it tomorrow. we were originally posed to have our gig at the church today, but that didnt work out, but hopefully we can get a chance sumtime in the future, maybe close future... but yea its more of a relief with adam only just getting back from calgary and being all jet lagged... lol  so today, i found out that i can sew. odd word isnt it... "sew".. looking at it u would think it sounds like "sue"... and maybe the way it should be spelt it... "sou"... meh, english is an odd language isnt it. Us humans just give it a bad reputation. Take me for example.   "Huked on Fonics Werkit Fer Me, Cantcha Tell?  so yea, here i am, with a needle and thread, and an old pair of jeans... so im thinking... its pretty hot outside, and i need sum new shorts... so... *snip snip*... then im thinking, wow, these got 2 holes in the ass... so.. i cut out 2 patches from the left over leg peice... and make the letters... F... and U... and then... get the thread and needle, and patch it up... so now my ass says... F-U on it... yay.   now im searching my drawers for other old clothes, and find a habs shirt which is practicly brand new cuz i never wore it, and never will, so i cut the logo out of it (it was the only good part of the shirt, the rest was ugly)... and sew that on... so now these shorts are lookin a lil more cuztomized...   Next i find these krazy markers that are meant for drawing on fabric (THANK YOU CRAYOLA)... so i put a nyce G! on there... muahaha... anywayz, so far i wanna add a Canada flag, and a Nirvana patch or sumtin... we shall see, its a work in progress... ill let u kno how it goes..  post any ideas u may have for me to put on my customized jean shorts... !  wut else is there to say?... Kraft dinner is mm mm good... wally the turnip was murdered yesturday by boiling to death.... trix arent for kids, they are a legalized drug from columbia brought into america by disguise... thats why u never see anyone actually buying Trix... if you turn out the light, is everything u cant see... still there?... think about it...

      So yea, long day, little sleep, no food, funeral ceremony.... theres ur insight to what i dealt with today.   So yea, spent about 7 hours on the road today, so im pretty exausted from that also... but watever. got to Renfrew ontario around 12, met up with my cuzens and stuff, and then headed to the cemetary.. and did that thing. Burrial thing. fun... :S  anywayz... there was one point during the ceremoney where all the grand kids (theres 8 of us) were posed to read from this passage in the bible... and... there was a pause... and no one was reading... so i look around and im think... WTF?... so i just started to read really loud, and finally everyone chirped in. i think we woulda been there all day if i hadnt started.   so i listened to my homemade slipknot cd about 2 times over on the way there, and then sum other stuff 2. music is good.  so i like ontario cuz... theres no french crazyness, but being their for awhile, u almost miss it, the background jibberish you only half understand... cuz i really hate listnein into ppls convo's and when everyones english over there, i understand it all... and they all understand me... its an eerie feeling... (yea ok, so maybe i HAVE lost my mind)  you kno when ur back in quebec when KFC... isnt KFC... its... PFK... like... wuts that stand for?... "Pretty Fucking Kool"... or... "Purple French Killer" or "Please French Kiss" or, "Penis Fiddle King"... like common... stop messin with everything.   Yea so i got home at 6 pm... went 2 lay down, and like passed out b4 i even had a chance to turn on the tv, so like i fell asleep with the remote in my hand... and the back and neck pain from the car... ahhh  anywayz im tired, so ill end this... post again soon tho...

      Darling, Darling, Stand by me, oh stand By MEee..  yea, so this is the song we prob playing at Matt's church sunday, if all works out. sure its not really a fan favorite of current teenagers, but, hey, its a great opportunity to get used to a crowd right?   so i woke up today, practiced guitar again... and again... lol, then got a hold of Matt, and made plans to hit his house around 2:30 to practice the song, and get my part down.   I then told mel that if she goes to see anchorman that i wouldnt talk about her manwhore lestat anymore... lol, but guess what... she couldnt, so... i think he needs to b checked out for disease, all the "innocent" girls he has been with, have probably given him enough disease to kill china.   I then discovered that Linzy is truly British, i alwayz knew, since we were at jess bowling party when we were 3, and she was really straight.... so... there u have it, the truth is out, just like her british husband oreo (he's a british cat) and my sisters british friend... sereena or sumtin... :P... THE BRITISH GIRL.  Yea, btw GESSIKA, emo sux... (well not all of it, but u kno... its not the best... sorri) just thought id say that... and... G! is forever better... and... Lil green men for Life Vanessa... and Mel... ALIENS are better than Vampires... (I heard im not fighting 3 wars :| )  So yea, i finally get to matts, and its about 2 45, and i still havent even had lunch yet... but who cares, we jamming. we practice a bunch of stuff including "7 nation army" three songs that we have of our own, and sum other random crap. Mostly we try to get "Stand By Me" sorted. (Btw, if you enjoy insane covers of old classy songs... check out "Stand By Me" by Pennywise)  umm ya, so we did all this randomness, watched sum tv, and eventually around 7, we  headed into the other room, and played sum old skool N64... Super Smash Brothers... YEAA... I LUV YOSHI :D.. anywayz... we lafed about that crap for awhile, and then alfred came over, and we headed back to the living room, and just relaxed, not really playing much, jus talkin... watching tv.   I HATE DRAGGON BALL... i dont kno how anyone cant watch that freaking show, but it seams everyone who does, is an addict... and all these cartoon guyz are 100% constapated, have terrible hair... and have the weirdest names? Freeza?... like WTF?... yea ok, i alwayz thought that was a refreshing popsicle like desert that i have when its so hot outside i cant breathe... but no... apparently its like sum bald bad-ass draggon ballz character... anywayz... Matt and alfred make me watch this show, everytime im there, and, then the tell me all about it, so now i have a database of draggonball in my mind, and i dont even follow it... and i think its only gonna get worse... lolz, but hey its all good, its still pretty fun, jus to watch the krazyness.... and constipation :D:D..  so yea, next thing that happens, is that alfred notices that "Top Gun" is on, and says that if we dont watch it with him, he is going home... hehe, he really likes this flyer stuff.. its pretty good movie tho, but the fact that i hate... HATE tom cruise (not just because he plays Lestat mel... i alwayz hated him, that just makes it worse tho ;))... makes this movie a lil hard to watch... but wtv. now i got one question for you all... WHERE THE HELL IS MAILMAN?  yea ok, so i finally get home, and like i still havent eaten, and then i discovered my parents at one time today manged to pick up pizza, so i get a slice, warm it up... and voila, relief of the evil monster eating at my insides... lol..  anyhow, i gotta get up at around 6 45 am tomorrow morning to go to ontario (about 3 1/2 hour drive) to burry the ashes of my grandmother... (R.I.P...

      Yeaaa, so its apparently thursday. So like most of my summer vacation, and joblessness, i woke up today, at 12 pm. :D. i think i practiced guitar again for a bit, and sum other random junk.  So my dad gets in, and he is like... heyy, lets go get our library/pool cards done. So i said sure considering no ones up at 3 pm anywayz. so we hit the library, where i havent been in like 2 years, lol, literally, it looks so different, they have sum trippy ceiling now. Umm, yea so after waiting 10 years for them to serve us, they take sum crapped out photo of me, and my dad. The girl messes up like 52 times on my dads card, and he has to sign his name that many times, because she is an incompetant librarian... i mean common... 1... 2... 3... its done... but no... its like... 1..2... skip a few... a hundred!...   After this my dad randomly starts lookin for a place he can get a key made. So i told him usually hardware stores do it, and mention reno-depot, (i initially said Brico... or is it... Briko?... meh)... anyawyz, so we finally get there, and he tells me he gonna make me a key for his car. (CHA CHING)... yea so incase u didnt kno, i dont even have my liscence yet...  so guess wut ppl... free joy rides :D:D... jkz... (I also discovered it only takes 2 bucks and 3 minutes to make a copy of a key, i thought it would take a day or 2 :O... )  umm after getting home, and playing sum acoustic guitar for a bit... and avoiding my sister and the friend she had over, I got a call from Alfred, to go do our band meeting. So i hit Matt's house, and Alfred was late... lol, so me and him jammed a bit with the guitars, and played around with sum new songs... then, i got to meet his parents :D.   Finally alfred showed up, and we discussed how we have to be harder with our music... we dont wanna be playing none of that EMO garbage... (sorri jess, i had to)... so yea, we gonna work on that when Adam gets back from Calgary. Apparently, we might have a small Gig Sunday night, at Matt's church. It will have to be a happy song... most likely... "Stand by Me" which i've got... 3 days to learn... woo hoo. i can do it tho, i already kno the main part, and going back to matt's tomorrow to learn the rest.   Should b interesting to tell adam when he gets back from calgary sat, that we have a gig sunday, lolz... who cares if he is jet lagged an exhausted from the like 4 hour flight... right?... :P... very interesting.

      So yea, its wed night, and band practice gets cancelled cuz, well we are all tired and its too late anywayz, so we decide to re-schedual it for tomorrow. so far, my biggest event of the day was when sum random guy from telus called to talk about my phone, and told me i can have free caller Id display for a month. THANK GOD. i hate not knowing who is calling me. lol.... anywayz  so im online talkin to mel and amanda(she's at mel's house), and i randomly say i feel like going for a walk. being the psychic person that I am, i couldn't of picked a better moment, cuz apparently they were on their way to go get a movie at rogers video. So yea, i head over to meet them, and sure enuf the moment i step out the door, it starts to rain.  so heres a lil background.... Mel luv's lestat, who is a manwhore, who is a vampire, and who is over 2000 years old... her favorite pass time activity, is tanning. ;) Amanda, what can i say about amanda, she should be blonde :P. She also has a staring problem, and tends to steal my hat, so i punched her in the chin with my watch.  So yea, by the time i get there, theres a random 3rd party by the name of Ryan, but a lot of ppl i kno, call him "Mini"... meh.. he likes star wars, climbing things... (including my back... i remember running down the street once at a party, and we fell, and it hurt... yea, stupid jess won that race, with whoev her team mate was... meh)  So we head into Rogers Video, and attempt to help find them a movie, but mostly its just me and Ryan shoving a bunch of random crap in their face, which they sadly turn away... (I really believe that "The Hill Has Eyes" is a good movie... and the vampire hunter.. meh) we also run into Kev and Tiff. Another random night in the making.  FINALLY, after about 10 hours of searching Mel & Amanda decide on 2 movies... one has the random manwhore Lestick in it, and the other is the movie Thirteen. then, amanda wants snacks for the movie, so we head into Metro  Plus ... this is where we reside for the next 25 min, in the snack isle. I continue to burn lestat as the time passes, and me and mel exchange time sittin on the floor, although, mine was much more short lived. Amanda cant make up her mind to what she wants to buy, but ends up with sum random chocolait, after negotiating with herself what she wanted to buy. (the one thing she really wanted, was caramilk popcorn, but of course, metro didnt sell that. hope the chocolait stuff hit the spot... lol)   we then sat outside for a bit, chattin about randomness, and i convinced Amanda to dye her hair blonde... muahahaha, surprise surpirse adam :P... anywayz, after some more talk, and lestat burning, we parted, and i got home, and decided i felt like playing guitar. I took out my trust old acoustic, and played that to the point where my fingers now have a new shape.   Now i'm enjoying sum slipknot, writing this crap for ya all to read and choke on, so yea, b4 this rivals the bible for longest story of BS... ill end it here (no offence)
