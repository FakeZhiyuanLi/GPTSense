      As always I'm taking a peek into other realms of radio world - ie, different jobs...I've been shotgunning to a myriad of midwest markets (Madison, Grand Rapids, Appleton, Chicago) and got this from Grand Rapids:  Greg: Thank you for the interest. I am sure you know WLAV is a 31 year heritage classic rock station that enjoys a passion level from our audience that is second to none. I love your work. I need a team member that is willing to work their ass off and do whatever it takes to be a winner. I am the short timer on my staff at two years, the next person is 7 years and most of the staff has been here 10+ years. We are market 66 but act and sound like market 33. If you are really serious about working long hours and being a part of one of the best rock stations left in our industry, tell me what $$ it would take to get you here and why I should consider you for a job at the legendary WLAV Grand Rapids. *** those are words that ring: "tell me what $$ it would take to get..."  -0-0-0- I'm bleary-eyed and should sleep extremely well tonight (after being like a kid before the first day of school last evening due to the above) - I've been scanning and putting together wedding pictures for a slide show for my promotions director. How much am I getting?? Whatever I want when I need it for a remote - or at least that's how it will work. I'm really surprised at how well I remember Powerpoint - haven't used it since SIFE in college.  I feel like I'm getting a sneak peek into someone's life - really when was the last time you had carte blanche on pictures from birth to present...so cool  Cool sites:  urlLink http://www.awfulplasticsurgery.com   urlLink http://www.goodplasticsurgery.com   Bed...now

        Alas, wanderlust has hit me again. I've grown tired of my current situation in Evansville. Being a morning jock is getting a bit tedious and I've found that moving out of the apartment is sounding more fun than sitting here for awhile.    If you're not in the know, I've been doing imaging and on-air for  urlLink WABX  since November 2002. Classic rock is fun, but I have a severe case of traveling wont and I think that getting back into top 40 would rock...been in talks with a station in Cedar Rapids, Iowa at  urlLink KZIA, Z102.9 . We'll see how all that shakes out...but it's good cash...      Think I've got the goods?    urlLink http://www.gregapplebee.com/demo.htm       and for top 40 stuff...       urlLink http://www.gregapplebee.com/chr2k1.mp3       With all this moving, I would like to suggest one thing that would totally sway my vote - national license plates and a national license. I could honestly give two flying flips if I've got the seal of Illinois, Iowa or Indiana on my license...it's an ID, get over it.  :::slide soap box away now::::     ******   Being a Q-list celebrity in a town about the size of your grandmother's interesting mole has it's moments....   Other than the relentless amount of production and imaging that people would enjoy to see me actually pull out of extremeties no one really wants to know about, there's the opportunity to meet people that actually work and have a real life.    Case in point would be SkiDay25 - about 4,000 people on a beach drinking and carousing for about 3 days - redneck riviera you're thinking? Nail on head...good call   Mass quantities of libation, most of the staff there, people flashing (that can be a godsend and in the next instant a horrific curse [thank you, 200 lb. lady in thong...no more comment is needed there]).    The best part was schmoozing with listeners...when a .37 cent frisbee can get a sixer of fine alcoholic beverages...well, I dig those economics.   We (being myself, our pd, the owner's son [a cool cat, btw] our promotions director and myself), for the most part, stayed within the closed off area of the stage. This would also be the 'holding area' for the other 'talent' onstage: paper people covering the event, the 'documentary' people (i've got first dibs on  Breast Fest on the Ohio ). Oh yes, the Hooters girls and the Miller Lite Dream Team...which are usually girls that used to be Hooters girls...ah, the circle of life.       ...and yes, I got two of their phone numbers...so sue me. I won't divulge more due to the fact that you'll just have to ask - wheee.    *********    urlLink http://www.photo.stamps.com    really, you'll like it      If you're looking about my exploits earlier this spring into minor league baseball, well, you'll have to wait. But let me say this about it: anytime you put males in contact with any new version of the push-up bra, frivolity is to occur.   Of course, I'm talking about the ever inducive and seductive male jock strap. Oh and don't argue that it's not a push-up bra: why do you think women love going to baseball games...it's not for the nuances of the spit 'n' grab (which was a major course of study for student-athletes at my four-year accredited university of choice)...the athletic supporter not only pushes the cheeks of one's gluteus maximus (and many women say they get pushed to the maximus...but i'm not looking) but it also has that cod-piece of a 'cup' in front - which is called a cup due to the fact that ancient 7th century tea drinking Europeans that read far too much Beowulf while playing cricket used real cups to protect their sticks n berries, or whatever colloquialism was being uttered at the time when all 'real' men decided it better to use something a bit more stalwart than their hands to block fast flying cricks. Regardless, the large plastic object protruding from one's nether regions leaves quite a bit for others to think about. Such as, 'How do men cross their legs,' 'how do they live with something down there,' and 'do they really need to adjust all the time?'
