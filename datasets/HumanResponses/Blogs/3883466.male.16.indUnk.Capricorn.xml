       Well...After Months of searching I have finally settled on a site for my Blog. Sam's DX was my inspiration, and Phil's blog was the finalizing factor.   More to Follow :-)

       So at SS today we did debates. As some of you can imagine...    I FUCKING DOMINATED    It was awesome, anything they could throw at me I was able to refute then rebutt. It was in Formal debate fashion (excluding Hume and Rather) and it was fully political. There were three issues discussed. Legalization of marijuana ( I was on panel), Constitutionality of the new smoking laws (I presented), and Capital Punishment (Again on Panel).   The panel is essentially the audience who gets to ask any question they want at the end of the presentations. I fucking stumped those to whom I asked a question. (Usually seven part questions :)) I was also able to crush any pathetic attempts to deflate my case. I was against smoking in a room of smokers, and I still crushed any panel questions, and my opponent.   It was great for my self esteem. :)

       Well...I had summer school today, and surprise surprise...it was the same old shit.   We are doing debates, but our teacher is such a fuck head that he didn't set it up right, and even chose our opinions for us. Fun. Well, I am supporting the new smoking laws in Massachusetts. He did this so as to avoid confrontation, which I would have presented. I hate him as much as Martin. Don't get me wrong...I hate Martin too. I hope Guido breaks her arm soon.   Yea...focus. So we went to the Library today. I gathered information like: A printout of the new law, the ingredients in Cigaretts, and other crap that no one in their right mind should care about.   Then, Mex picked me up, and I went back to her house to fix her Satellite reciever. (Turn it on). Then I got The Trepster and headed home. I got ready for work and then left.   I did more computer-based training. Fun. After getting about three hours into this beast of a lesson, I had to take my break and I lost my spot in the computer terminals. So I says to Lisa, I says, "I have forty five minutes and nothing to do." She had me shadow this oddly attractive guy I helped him bag, and then we had to get carriages. One of which hit my car. I am weird when I park, and I have friends who can attest to this. I like to park waaaaaaaaaaaay out in the middle of nowhere. Like, where the lights don't shine, i.e. the mugging havens.   I was harvesting carriages, and I see Treppy, way out yonder. Alone. With no cars around for ten spots at least. And a carriage with the corner having hit just above the rear passenger wheel. Argh.   Yep..well...that's about it.   TTFN

       Nothing of Importance happened today.   The unnerving thing about that is that the King of England wrote the same thing in his journal on July 4, 1776.

        Well...Sam, Phil, Dan and I have hit some more rocks in our friendship. I am certain that we will overcome. We are good friends, but, like the title indicates, shit happens.   I don't even remember why we aren't talking, it happens so often nowadays. Each person blames the other, and a whole feud begins. Its a really healthy relationship, thanks for asking.   As in any strong relationship, concessions have to be made. I think we are all just sick of having to concede. I know I get a triffle offended when they slit my moral throat. And I know that they get angry when I bring it up. So we all get really pissy. Its kinda like a weekly PMS. I admit I am just as sick of it as they are, but we all have issues that the others are unwilling to address. C'est la vie. Guys...It was great, but I am moving on. Life is too short....Shit happens, then you die.   I am more than willing to re-open peace negotiations...

        Well...I did try to audio blog, but it didn't work out so hot. So we all know that I disappeared to Bean Town this weekend. Some fun stuff happened.     &nbsp;  It started when my aunt stopped by to tell me that she was going to take me to Boston the next day. Well...that started me a thinkin' and I realized that I double booked my weekend. :-/&nbsp; There was a party at the Jensens that I said I was going to, but then my aunt was taking me for the weekend. The decision was a difficult one, but family comes first.     &nbsp;  I did get to drive to boston in the Beemer :-). I got there and there was nothing to do. There is a HUGE pool, but it is cold no matter how long it is in the sun, and there is a monster TV. The only problem with the TV is that it is in the media room. The room we were painting...Meaning, no furniture. I became an expert on solitaire, and started averaging about 3000 points per game. Not too shabby, eh? BTW...NO INTERNET. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE. But I made them call, and they ordered it. :-) I love my influence.    &nbsp;  So after being high on paint fumes, it didn't help that they bought me an entire case of Twisted Tea. Oh yea...next time...I bring friends. I got a call on saturday afternoon. I got a job. Big Y. I start on Saturday. Treppy will be mine at last.     &nbsp;  Also..I learned a new card game. I will have to teach it to you guys.

       Well...I go the interview. I answer their questions. I did a fine job, but they said that they are doing call backs for second interveiws. They said that they would call back on Monday the earliest.   I called my aunt, and she says that they only do second interviews for corporate stuff. Oh well...  I am going to hold out hope...I NEED THIS JOB FOR MY BABY!

       THIS IS REDICULOUS...i AM SITING HERE HAVING FNISHED EVERYTHING THAT i NEEDED to finish, but still cannot go anywhere. Today, In additin to our Daily language crap, we read the Tell-Tale Heart. Fond memories of sixth grade flooded back to me. THIS IS INSANE. I am writing most of this entry in a word document on my PDA, and this keyboard is kinda difficult to type on. Anyways.....  Recent developments:  Sam and I are talking again, and there will be no more of an explanation. So...  After we made up, we went to the mall with Phil, and attempted to play the Lesbian game, then the Mullet game, then the Lesbian-Mullet game. You have to understand...we were bored.   I am trying desperately to get my PDA to work on the wireless network at home. I have several cards, and the network adapters, and the cradle, and the keyboard, and just about every thing besides a stylus. It doesnt stick in anymore, and I kinda lost it somewhere. Well...i think that my battery is dying as per my PDA keeps shutting off. So ... TTFN  I lied, it has just about a full charge, but I am attracting a lot of unwanted attention with my little setup. this Travishamockery of a teacher jut told me to put it away, and I gave him the death stare, and he retreated. I feel victorious.   Reminder...download more games for this beast...I have won solitaire for my 25th time before i started writing this. It was crazy. I think those flying cards are getting burned into my screen.   WTF...MY FUCKIN COMPUTER KEEPS SHUTTING OFF..  Like my random thoughts???  So I have an interveiw at 1530 at Big Y. I hope I get the job, I need it to get Treppy.   OMG...HE REALIZED THAT WE HAVE TIME AND NOTHING TO DO, SO HE IS GIVING US A JEWISH ASSIGNMENT.    LATER THAT DAY........  My aunt came to my house today. She was in her beautiful beemer. I asked if I could take it for a spin around the block, and to my SHOCK she said yes. She handed me the keys, and she was like...A half our okay? Thinking I would have the car for like five minutes...I was soooooooooooooo happy.   http://www.epinions.com/auto_Make-1998_BMW_M3 Its that exact car...black. Four Doors are rare..but she got it.   Furthermore, she may let me take it to my interview. :-DDDD

       SS was horrible today, as usual. I was finished with my assignment at 10:51, and had to sit until 12:00 when he dismissed us. I wanted to die. Everyone one else was finished early, but not as early as me. The rest of the class was spent playing solitare on my PDA, and the rest of the class talked.   Common topics of disscussion were drugs, drug usage of students, and drug paraphernalia. Seven students incriminated themselves of drug possesion today, and the teacher said "umm" eighteen times. I was bored...  As I was writing this, I saw a thing on Fox News for W Ketchup. I just wanted to mention it becuase I think its really cool. http://www.wketchup.com/  Yea...So sam and I still aren't talking, she refuses to apologize because she feels that she didn't do anything wrong. Well, Sam, I think what you did was really shitty. And when you apologize to me...We'll talk. Until then............  That's all for now.

       Well...Sam and I got into an argument. I am Blu47nav (If you couldn't tell), Sam is Sam Gambo, and Phil is Foxnewser. Skim and tell me what you think.   sam gambo: fuck this you guys seriously i'm going out with julie sam gambo: every fucking day we go through this sam gambo: i'm sick of it sam gambo: so screw it Blu47nav: Then hang out with Julie sam gambo: i am Blu47nav: Fine Blu47nav: Just don't expect me to drop everything when you feel like going out when I do get a car.... sam gambo: ... why are you being pissy about this? sam gambo: i have been waiting since 10 AM this morning to hang out with you guys Blu47nav: Becuase I just went though a whole bunch of shit to even secure Ysler, and you are just going to go out with Julie sam gambo: kris sam gambo: you won't even get the car until 8:30 sam gambo: probably later. sam gambo: and then we can hang out for what, 2 hours because you have to be home by 11? sam gambo: i dropped plans with julie twice, my friend chris and kaylyn and julianne to hang out with you guys sam gambo: it's my day off and i'm not wasting anymore time waiting around for a car Blu47nav: Fine xFoxNewserx: Well, it's not like Kris isn't trying to get the car, he's doing all he can do. sam gambo: if you do get the car, maybe we can all hang out with julie sam gambo: i know  sam gambo: i'm not mad at you for not having the car sam gambo: i'm just sick of waiting sam gambo: i know it's not your fault Blu47nav: Well...its like a slap in the face to me...Well..I'm done waiting for you, and there is someone better to hang out with Blu47nav: SO I will go out with them, and see you guys later sam gambo: you know she isn't better than you sam gambo: but right now anything is better than sitting in this house. sam gambo: if you want to take it offensively, whatever Blu47nav: Ya know..I have made sacrifices to even reserve the car, and like Phil says...I'm doing all that I can do...but it appears that it was all in vain, becuase you decided that waiting for Phil and I isn't worth it sam gambo: Kris, if you're going to be mad at me, that's fine. Blu47nav: Do you understand why I am angry? Blu47nav: Well..I am not really angry, I am just bothered sam gambo: Yeah, and I think it's a really shitty and selfish reason. Blu47nav: I think its really shitty and selfish that you are dumping Phil and I for Julie just becuase she can be there now sam gambo: But I am going out with Julie because I have already called her and asked her for the third time now if she wants to do something, and I am not telling her "Nevermind I'm doing something with Kris and Phil" again. sam gambo: Well isn't that just too damn bad. sam gambo: I could have gone out with Julie at noon, and I waited for you guys. sam gambo: All I ever do for you guys is wait. sam gambo: I even offered alternatives to getting the car. Blu47nav: And I am doing everything I can to get out of here to pick your ass up...but its not good enough for you sam gambo: Get a ride here, or get Phil because I could have gotten a ride to your house. I still could get one. sam gambo: But you said no, you wanted to wait for the car. sam gambo: I'm done waiting. sam gambo: I'm going out. sam gambo: We can do something tomorrow. sam gambo: Or later tonight. Blu47nav: I'm sure there is someone better for me to hang out iwth  sam gambo: Or we can all hang out with Julie. Blu47nav: becuase I dont want to wait until tomorrow sam gambo: Well I didn't want to wait until 9 PM at night until your family was done holding the car above your head. sam gambo: But I did. sam gambo: But now I'm done. Blu47nav: Me too sam gambo: I'm sorry that that bothers you. sam gambo: But that's how it is. Blu47nav: IF I did this to you...you would be ripping me up and down Blu47nav: How about...when Dan did this to us...you ripped him apart sam gambo: Then rip me apart, Kris. sam gambo: Go ahead. sam gambo: I don't care. Blu47nav: I'm not going to waste my time...becuase I can do other things that I had to postpone while I was catering to your wanting to go out sam gambo: Why don't you still want to go out with Phil? Blu47nav: I fully intend to sam gambo: I had just assumed that your family wasn't going to let you have the car at all, even after they went shopping, which is what they do every other night. Blu47nav: When did you make this assumption, becuase If you told me a little earlier....I might have been able to make other plans aswell sam gambo: Your plans were still the same, Kris. sam gambo: Unless you were planning on ditching Phil. Blu47nav: I was doing this for YOU...becuase YOU wanted to go out...and it was all worthless sam gambo: I still want to go out, and I am going out, and you two are fully welcome to come. Blu47nav: Speaking for myself, I would much rather die sam gambo: Then have fun doing your own thing. sam gambo: I'm sorry that this bothers you, I'm not angry. Blu47nav: I am...My sacrifices aren't good enough, and you are going to ditch Phil and I becuase you want to get out of your house Blu47nav: more than you want to hang out with us sam gambo: You know that's not how it is, so stop trying to pick a fight with me, Kris Blu47nav: I dont know thats not how it is Blu47nav: becuase that is what is it looks like Blu47nav: and it looks that way, becuase it is... sam gambo: It's not that complicated, Kris. sam gambo: I'm sick of waiting, and so I am leaving. sam gambo: That's it. Blu47nav: And that is a shitty move... xFoxNewserx: I hate popup ads and banner ads that talk to you. Blu47nav: Thanks sam gambo: I don't think it's a shitty move. Blu47nav: I know you don't... sam gambo: I'm gonna have fun and for a good 2 and a half more hours than if I wait for the slight chance that you may get a car tonight ... sam gambo: And if and when you get your car, you can call me, since it's apparent that me hanging out with you is so important, and we can do something. Blu47nav: Its not anymore... Blu47nav: But it was the entire reason I jumped through hoops to even reserve the car Blu47nav: But that means nothing to you Blu47nav: So...go... Blu47nav: Have fun with Julie sam gambo: Do you guys want to come? sam gambo: Julie will pick both of you up.l Blu47nav: I might have been interested a while ago, but now, no sam gambo: LOL sam gambo: What have I done since a while ago that has made you not want to hang out? Blu47nav: you have made me disect why this is such a shitty thing for you to do to me, and phil, and then you don't see why sam gambo: I see why you're mad, Kris. sam gambo: But you are just picking a stupid fight. I'm disgusted that you'd get this angry. You've made me wait for over ten hours to do something when I could have done something at any time during the day. sam gambo: And you don't even see why I'm going out. sam gambo: Because a) You probably won't get the car. sam gambo: We know your family is famous for bringing things up or needing it for other things. sam gambo: b) If you do get it, you'll get to leave for all of .. an hour. sam gambo: Now I want to hang out with you two, still, but I want to hang out with Julie, too, and she has offered to hang out with both of you and pick both of you up, too. sam gambo: If you don't want to because you don't want to hang out with me because you think what I'm doing it shitty, that's fine, but you now have nothing to justify your anger because I'm inviting you out with us. sam gambo: If either of you would like to go, you can leave me a message, but if you'll excuse me, I have to get ready. sam gambo: Goodnight. sam gambo has left the room.

       Well...I awoke from a strange dream to a pleasant surprise. Treppy was in the driveway waiting to take me right to school. At school we did our Daily language crap, and then we watched the Dead Poets Society. I love that movie...its my new favorite. It does kinda seem like a gay love story. And did you ever notice how some movies could be easily converted into pornos? Dead Poets Society would make a great gay one.   Anyways. I came home for lunch, but then Ashley told me I had to return Treppy. So I drove back to Grandma's house, and my brister was there. So we all got int the car, and I drove home. Grandma took the car, and went home. Then Kodi told me that Grandma is planning to give the car to Ashley, and leave me with nothing.   This presents me with a slight problem. Do I believe Kodi, who is right about 3 1/2% of the time, or do I start planning for not having a vehicle.   If Ashley gets my car, I think I will take her insurance money and buy a nicer car. BIOTCH.   BTW...I was called by a prospective employer and I have an interview at 15:30 on Thursday. Also, A haircut on Wednesday at the same time.

       So this weekend wasn't that bad despite some earlier problems. We planned a weekend after my previous one fell threw, involing Sam, Phil, and myself. We did want Dan to come, but he had work :-(.   So BY SOME MIRACLE OF GOD, WE ALL HAD RIDES...I'm telling you that is an extremely rare occurence. Right up there with Planetary Alignment or bathing for some people. so we didn't do anything special, we played card...and more card. It was fun though, we were among friends, And Cammy was there so it was great. I'm sure pictures are available somewhere. We talked about how Chantel, the blind girl in our school, is really kinda nasty, and made horrible fun of her. I'm pretty sure there is a video of our exploits somewhere out there.   And then Sam was brought home when Smashley came home from her whoring. Then Phil, who slept over if you couldn't tell yet, and I watched beaches. I admit it....I cried. But you have to understand. That whole Wind Beneath my Wings song has a different meaning for me. They played it at my Grandfather's funeral and that night was actually one year since his death. So anyway...on to greener pastures...  Then the next day we did the same thing...Phil and I played card while being plagued by my Brister. Then Sam came over, but Dan couldn't make as per he made other plans. Phil and Sam got really mad at him, and I don't really care one way or another. But Sam absolutely crush Stoney's spirit. Somehow Nicole got involved, and Sam and her tangoed. You can ask me for a sample of their convo. So becuase I didn't get pissed at Dan, I am assumed to have a crush on him. I don't, but they won't believe me anyways.   Then we played cards...again. If you are curious...we Play rummy, and I really like it. And its pretty sad that they had to teach me :-/.   So then Today, Monday, It was back to the SS Internment camp. Today we did our Daily grammar shit, and then we did analogies :-DDDDDDDDD not. I was so excited to revisit fourth grade materials that I almost wet myself. Grandma dropped me off today, and wouldnt let me take the car to begin with, even though I asked. On the return trip, I asked if I could take it, and she said that she had to put gas in it first. What exactly that means...I don't know...  Getting that car is like the fucking Survivor challenge. In order to get any car (Ysler, Ion, or Treppy) I have to do a fucking challenge. To get Ysler yesterday I had to lay in a bed of cockroaches.   To get Treppy today I can't even imagine what I have to do, but I do have to run...I'm late for my fucking Immunity Challenge.

       I FUCKING HATE...  After Operation Lieberman fell through I was hoping I could salvage some sort of plan for tonight. BUT NOOOOOOOOOoooOOOoOOOoOoOOooOoOoOoOOoOoOOoooOOO.   So my mom says I can take her car after I slave over a mountain of chores, which is nothing unusual. So I get home, ready to take the car, when I learn that SMASHLEY took the car to go fucking baby-prostituting. What a fucking Slampoe.  So I call her up and ask if I could take it run to pull an Operation Phil, but she says no. WTF, NO?! Ysler is just sitting in some rich guys driveway while she watches his kids. I AM SO MAD. I HAD THE FUCKING CAR RESERVED BUT SMASHLEY HAS TO WATCH CHILDREN. FUCK ME.   I KNOW I will not be able to get Treppy becuase I would have to fucking return my FUCKING CAR to my grandmother by nine, nine thirty at the absolute latest. Becuase the fucking car....NO...MY fucking car has to sit in her driveway becuase she is a control freak. FUCK  So...our plans are shot for the night guys. I'm sorry.  FUCK ME...JUST FUCK ME LONG AND HARD.

       Once again, the plans have changed. My mom went on a rampage upon learning of my proposed trip, and tore my dad apart just as she had that Telemarketer earlier.   Anyways. The new plans are I mow the lawn at two (I'm a little late, but I don't give a flying fuck.) and he will call me at about five thirty to give me information regarding my trip down there. I will make him pick me up tonight even though I am pretty certain that he wants to get me tomorrow. I'm living in a war zone, and I need to get out...tonight.  Well...exactly 27,971 square feet of over-grown grass is calling me...  I'm going to only mow 26,999 and they can suck my ass if they don't like it.

       My dad called today, and I am going to spend the rest of the weekend with him and my step mom to be. Mind you I have never met her, seen their house, or what they do. Plus it's extra brownie points come Kristmas Time. :-/  It's currently noon if you can't read the time that's right there. And he is going to be here around four. Hopefully he will come pick me up in the Infinity...and I will drive us back to New Haven. I will have my cell phone with unlimited text messaging. Let's use it children.   TTFN.   P.S. Expect an awesome entry when I get back and I can't update while I am down there except by audio blog. I don't think they have Internet :-( If they do, I will be on AIM Down there. If I am not on AIM, then they don't have internet....right....cheerio

       Last night I had the weirdest dreams ever. At least I think it was more than one, but you never know with dreams.   I was at someone's house; I think it was Sam's. I needed a drink, So I opened the cabinet to get a glass. In the Cabinet, I see the largest M&M Sundae I have ever seen. It was made like a regular M&M Sundae, but it was in like a Double Jack Dandy bowl. (Those of you who are regulars to Friendly's know what I am talking about.)   Then, somehow, next scene of my dream I was with Dan. We were at the movies not paying attention to the movie, but just making out... o_O Odd, huh? Then we were at Dan's house, but not the house we all know. It was different. It was a much lager, but older house that somehow reminded me of Max Bertrand's house. But then, at the far corner of the house, by the road, there was a single police car. I wandered over to that corner of the house, and everyone else was elsewhere. Then the cop knocked on the window, and told me to hand him everything in the room, but not to touch it becuase I was standing in a crime scene. Apparently some body was discovered under a tree outside in the dark. So after I asked the officer to repeat what he said (hand everything in the room to him through the window) I turn around and the room is like a mile long. Then Dan's mom waddles in and tells me that she would handle everything, but I didn't want to because I had my fingerprints on four items. I thought I was going to go to jail unless I handled it. It was sketchy.   OMG AND...At about 10:30 this morning, the phone rang. My mother slithered over and picked up the phone and gave a skeptical 'hello?' Then next thing I know, my mom had totally broken this poor telephone solicitor and she was screaming at the top of her lungs. My mom beat her bloddy corpse into the ground so far that she probably commited suicide a few minutes later.

       Phew...After a little bit of confusion I was able to get everything to work. Like I said in my other Blog (which I set up accidently, but I cannot find a way to get rid of it) I have wanted one of these for a while. JFC I FEEL LIKE ITS KRISTMAS :-D . Sam Inspired me with her DX, and Phil was the deciding factor when I read his.   Right, so. I got the audio blogger thing to work, and I made a test post. I later deleted it becuase it made me sound like a fag, not that I don't do that on my own. It is a really cool feature, and if I ever like the sound of my voice, I may use it.   So about my day. Well...I woke up at about nine to the ringing of the telephone. Never fail, a solicitor answered requested a parent, and horribly mispronounced, of all words, KELLY. After that, I called my grandmother and told her to bring over Treppy to take me to school. Like usual, She needed MY FUCKING CAR to run errands, and refused my offer to drop her off at home so she could take her other car.   So I went to summer school and almost died as per it is so boring. The dick-head teacher finally realized that we were using a seventh grade text book, and gave us a ninth grade book. Close but no cigar...  That's it so far, I will probably update again today becuase this is my new toy :-) . TTFN

        Here we go again, again:      I left my Sam to English dictionary at home, and I apparently overlooked that when you block someone, it means to them to call. Hmm...I always thought it was "I can't stand to talk to you, you fucking whore."      But, Times are achaging, and I guess I am behind the times.       So I have been blocked and unblocked, and I am supposed to acknowledge this as a twisted signal, and to call. Well, I didn't becuase I assumed the "Don't talk to me whore" status was still on my head, and I was not about to make a suicidal phone call. Now, they are more mad me for being so stupid. I am so sorry that I couldn't read your signs.       So, I was then yelled at to call her, and being as angry as I was, I was not about to make that phone call. I will make it at my earliest possible convience.       At last I knew, you had my number too. If you wanted me to call you that badly, call me.       I apologized to phil, becuase he unblocked me. If Sam had unblocked, I would've apologized to her as well.

       I finally get a new cell phone today, and I cannot wait.   I want to take this time and say that...Nokia 8265, you served me well. I have found something better in my life.   I want to take this time also to usher in my new phone. LG 4050, Take a bow.   Those bastards at Cingular set it up so that we aren't elligible for an upgrade until sometime in March at the earliest, So I have to pay full price for the phone.   Dad has to pay full price for the phone*

        Here we go again. Sam and Phil are mad at me becuase I went to NoHo with the Jensens. We didn't do much of anything...Just walked around.       So, Like I said before, Sam and Phil are mad at me. And probably rightfully so. I had made mention to Sam of possibly picking her up from Volleyball thing. And Phil was planning for a trip. I, as I usually do, stopped at the Jensens, and one thing led to another.       Anyways, its not the first time. Maybe its part of the curse. This must be how it effects me. But, C'est la Vie.       I've blocked this entry from all IPs except mine, or I can go to a certain page and enter a password. I don't know why I am writing that since I already know it, and no one else will read this.       P.S. I have unblocked this entry.

       i...  hate...  kodi...  Today, I decided to get a car and go down and see my father. Why? well, I hadn't seen him in quite some time, I haven't seen his new house, and I haven't seen the new church. Not that I was overly enthusiastic to do anything of these things, especially the latter, I decided that today would be as good a day as any.   I called my grandmother to get a car. She comes over with the Intrepid, and tells me that she wants me to take Kodi with me. I start an argument with her over that. I finally agreed when she conceeded he sit in the back and not say anything.   So, I said, "Fine, but I want to take the Ion becuase it has a CD player." So, I shower and she changes cars. I drop her off and stop back home to make CDs. I tell Krodi that I am ready to go, and he climbs into the front seat. First mistake. I think nothing of it and go. The CD doesn't work becuase I forgot to finish it. BAH, oh well.   We reluctantly leave. I have told my family on many occasions that I would never want to be stuck in an enclosed space with someone i dispise so much. But, I wanted to go, and it was Grandma's stipulation. My grandmother also insists that I take route 75. I wanted to take 91. I took route 75. I call my father, and he tells me to get on 91 as soon as possible.   I finally get set on 91, and Kodi starts becoming really annoying. He is talking, singing along to the radio...off beat and key, he starts rummaging through the glove box, and flipping the visor. Just irritating shit that distracts me as I am trying to drive.   We get there after seventeen phone calls to my father asking for better directions than the ones he'd given before.   We don't do anything special. My brother and I fight tooth and nail. He is just such a jerk, he is annoying, and just a fucking bastard. I wish death upon him. (Izzy, Do me this much.) I tell my father that I am leaving him here, and if he had said yes, I would've in a heart beat.   Then we go to leave. I tell him that he has to sit in the back seat so he doesn't distract me. He gets in the front. My father, sensing a conflict, leaves for his VooDoo courses. So its Kodi and I in the driveway of the house. I get out of car and walk to the patio. I sit in the chair. Kodi gets out of the car, and I lock the doors using the remote, then I unlock just the driver door. I get in, start the car and back out of the driveway. I go about a block away and pull over. I call sam and ask what I should do. She said that I should turn around and get him. So..I turn around and as I pull infront of the house, my grandmother beeps through. She is screaming, and telling me to turn around and get him. I told her that I was right in front of the house, and he was just an idiot.   As I hang up the phone with her, I see that he had taken a chair off the porch climbed up to and opened a window, knocked out a screen, and climbed inside. He comes outside and gets in the back. Now, at this point if I could have gotten my way, he would be riding in the trunk. But it didn't work that way. I start to drive towards the highway, and he throws his shoes up into the passenger seat. Wondering WTF he is doing, I slow down and turn around and see his entire girth coming at me at full speed. I push him back down and yell at him for even trying that. I screamed that it was a good thing that I had stopped becuase I could've hit something. Then I call my father and ask him for directions to the Org becuase I am dropping him off. I cannot deal with his bullshit.   He is the victim of some very bad parenting, and that no person on the fucking face of god's green earth should have to deal with that jerk. I told my father that he created this monster, and HE was going to have to deal with it. This was, in no way, my responsibility. I told him that Kodi was his problem and I was cleaning my hands of him. I can't safely drive home with him.   I hear a siren over the phone, and then the next thing I know I see an ambulance coming toward me from the opposite direction. Knowing that he walked, I headed toward where the ambulance came from. I recognized immediately where I was, and I turn around and parked. Then I walked into the "church".   I see my father sitting down and eating his dinner. I walk over to him and he says "look, I have to be in there in five minutes." I told him that he had better take care of this quickly then. We walk back out to the car. Kodi is gone. We have no idea to where or anything. We get back in the car and drive back to my fathers house. No Dice. We go back to the church and see him walking.   I was ready to leave, and Kodi was insistant upon the front. After seven way calling like everyone. It was my father on his phone who had called me. I confrenced called my mother who confrence called my grandmother. My dad confrence called Pam (step mom to be). Everyone was debating on what to do. I again repeated that I am not Kodi's parent. He is misbehaving, and it's not my problem.   Anyways, we leave (with Krodi in the back) and he starts acting up. I called everyone as soon as he did something in violation of our agreement. Which was about every five minutes.   I get home, and drop him off at the house. Then I go to return the car at the Jensens. I stop and tell my tale and run in the house and grab some Ibuprofen, but I had to go home before I could get any. I didn't answer my cellphone which was in the car about twenty feet away, and my grandmother called and asked them to send me home.   I go to her house to pick her up and bring her here so she can take the car back. (She has control issues with the vehicles and has divised this bizarre ritual to transfer drivership.) She seemed fine, and on the way home. I said, "I am never doing this again."   To this she replied, "You're right."  Can somebody tell me what she means???   Punishments:  I have no idea what Grandma is planning but I know that Mom will not let me use her car anymore. For what? I HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE.   I have decided that I am moving out of this house. I hate my family and I really hate my brother. I don't know where I am going yet, but I think it will probably be at my Uncle's new house.   Its too unhealthy here. I hate it.

       Guys...Let me jot down the steps it takes for me to get the car. I hope you will have some sort of understanding for next time.   1. Get out of work. (This step may not always exist.) 2. Get call from friend asking me to secure a vehicle.  3. Decide that going out may not be such a bad idea, and agree to attempt to secure vehicle.  4. Make excuse why I can keep current vehicle longer. (This step may not always exist.) 5. Get home and allow potential occupants to work out the details of a plan.  6. Mentally fabricate a legal story that would explain my needs for said vehicle.  7. Tell vehicle owner the story that explains the car's usage. Usage may include: Gas Consumption, Seat rearranging, trash in vehicle, added miles, etc.  8. Wait for Gary becuase Mom seems incapable of making an informed decision by herself. ** 9. Wait for Gary to do nothing, and Mom makes/says/does everything anyways. ** 10. Do all necessary chores, and promise to do additional chores the next day or upon my return.  11. Wait for vehicle owner to deliver vehicle. *** 12. Bring deliverer home. *** 13. Wait even longer while Mom lectures me that I only talk to her when I need the vehicle. **** 14. Listen to family member's describe to me, my familial social patterns. **** 15. Listen to family member's describe how I do "nothing" around the house. **** 16. Search for the keys because Mom never keeps track.  17. Come back online/to the phone and listen to complaints the lenght of the process thus far.  18. (Optional) Defend myself from angry friends who failed to realize that there was a risk of my not getting the car. (Potential cycle end.) 19. Drive, depending on the plan, to pick up friends, who, by Murphy's Law, will always live on opposite corners of the earth. * 20. Risky activity period.  This period may also be, and usually is, the most enjoyable. * 21. Re-run previously stated risks to bring guests back home. * 22. Top of gas if necessary, if financially able, as to hide gas consumption.  23. Return vehicle.  24. Be returned home, and feel guilty of vehicle owner having to drive at late hours. ***  * This is where I worry about the car getting stolen, or getting into an accident or getting pulled over, losing my license, and subsequent legal and parent issues. Granted something has not happened, It does not mean that it will not happen. These risks carry greater punishments/come into existence when the first guest enters the vehicle.  ** If Ysler  *** If Treppy  **** Steps that can be re-ordered.   The entire process (up to step 19), not inclusive of excluded steps or steps that are not mentioned, takes, on average, 45 minutes. This process may take upwards of 1 hour.   There are basic legal principles that one must understand to fully comprehend all the steps. One must be intimately familiar with restrictions on my Junior Operator's License (JOL) as well as the limits imposed on a regular Driver's License.    These are just the steps I have to run through EVERY time, occasionally, I have steps that happen once, or twice. These steps do not make it onto the general list.    It is important for you guys to note that:    - If there is no plan, I cannot make up a story that would explian the mileage, gas consumption, and everything else I have to deal with, but you don't experience.     - There is ALWAYS the risk of my not getting a vehicle.     - It is a recreational outing for you, while a large percentage is a task for me.     - If this is not good enough for you. Seek alternative measures for transportation.

       Well...Today was boring. I woke up and bathed. Then I went over to the Jensen's house. It was fun, as it always is. Ashley was up/down (whichever you prefer) from New Hampshire, and we swapped bus stories. Then we went to Pajers to get lunch. Thank you Ashley (she paid).   Then, After lunch with Ashley, Erik, Andy, Jay, Mr. Jensen, Mr. Davidson, and Mrs. Davidson, I had to go to work. :-(  Work was boring and sucked very very badly. I chatted with Dan through text messages on my break. I was soooo bored.   Then I left. HALLELUJAH...BOW DOWN AND PRAISE THE LORD. I was free. On my way home, I made my usual pit stop at the Jensen's, again. As I turned into the driveway the phantom noises repossessed Treppy. The engine makes a ticking noise, much like when you stick a playing card in the spokes of a bicycle, and the right front tire squeakes when you turn the wheel.   Bah. I fear I may have to trade it in. In a way I want to, but my attemptes to eradicate my soft side have failed, and something still tells me to hang on to it becuase it was my grandfather's car. And for those of you who don't know...he died. That's why I have it.   Anyways. If I have to trade it in. I want a 1998-2002 Chrysler 300M. But Samantha has kinda convinced me to take a step down and get a Chrysler Concorde LXI. Both are possible.   Who Knows...  More to follow...TTFN

       Well...Once again, we have revised the entire floor plan of the house. Renovations officially begin in about three weeks.   What is currently the kitchen is going to be demolished, and rebuilt into a recreation room. Plans include a pool table, card table, huge chairs, and monster TV.   What is currently the living room will seamlessly transition into the new Dining room. The new Pellet stove will be installed.   What is currently the Nothing Room will become the new kitchen. This room will have a colour scheme of red and white, chosen, of course, by my colour blind mother.   What is currently Ashley's Bedroom will become the downstairs bathroom. Who else will have two 120 sq. ft. bathrooms. The upstairs bathroom, as well as the bed rooms will be redone next year.   Changes for my room. Well, I will get getting a new door, a new floor, and new walls. Good bye ugly pine paneling :-)  Mind you I had no idea any of this was happening until the credit card bills came in the mail, and my mom was complaining of a huge Visa bill. This, of course, prompted my questioning what a new stove, washer and dryer were for...  I had an idea that we were re-doing the kitchen, but I didn't know it was going to be translated 25 feet along the floor plan. But, they never tell me anything.   Now, I am faced with the dilemma of moving in with Uncle Dean, or staying here.   TTFN

       Jew School is over!!  I hated it and its finally over. I will NEVER do that again. I guess next year I can't campaign to get some teachers fired. :-/  IN other news. Yesterday, right before work, we went to the cingular store to get new phones. Well...They were out of my LG 4050, and then said that we weren't eligible for an upgrade until march. I said that I was eligible since April, but I was waiting for my mom. And the guy said that for some reason our contract got restarted...  WELL....WRONG ANSWER, BUDDY. SHE RUINED HIS LIFE LIKE SHE DOES TO TELEMARKETERS.   Then we left all angry, and we decided that we were going to look into other cell phone carriers. Mom suggested verizon, but, to me its the same as Cingular. And sam was having some problems with her bill. :-/  I was thinking Nextel, becuase the walkie talkie thing is fucking amazing. Gary has it, everyone of my family in Eastern Mass has it, and we should too.   Phil suggested T-Mobil...but Well...  Anyways...TTFN
