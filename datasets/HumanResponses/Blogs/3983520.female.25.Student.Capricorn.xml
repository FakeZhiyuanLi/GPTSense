      I don't know why but today I have so much energy.&nbsp; So many creative ideas keep going through my head.&nbsp; I have really been wanting to start my own business and I think I might have found a way to do just that.&nbsp; With a little bit of networking, I think it will all happen soon.&nbsp; I don't want to give you my idea just yet but I will definitely let you know when it all happens.&nbsp; I am so excited, I just hope I keep this motivation and actually carry everything out that I need to.&nbsp;  I will definitely keep you posted on the progress and I might need some opinions when it comes to choosing a name.&nbsp; So hold tight and keep your fingers crossed.

       Well I am definitely happy to say that I will be moving into my apartment this weekend after a two month search for a place to live.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the ideal place to live but it is a temporary living situation that will hopefully allow me to save some money and then move on to bigger and better things.&nbsp; I didn't realize how much stuff I have to buy.&nbsp; I am literally starting over from scratch.&nbsp; My ex-boyfriend really cost me a lot but I can't blame it completely on him.&nbsp; When I moved out of Oakland in the beginning of 2003, that was his fault.&nbsp; He just created too much drama at my apartment and I was asked to move.&nbsp; It ended up being overturned because it was an unlawful eviction but ever since it has been hard to find another place.&nbsp; I ended up moving in with my mom and putting all my belongings in storage.&nbsp; Living with my mom was hell on earth and I ended up moving out of there twice, last summer I just could not take it anymore so I moved for about two months and went back and then this summer I packed my stuff up for good and never looked back.&nbsp; I was paying my mom rent and everything.&nbsp; Going to school full time,&nbsp; working part time, and taking care of two kids on my own and all anyone wanted in her family was money from me.&nbsp; I mean I was struggling but I was putting money into everyone else's pocket but no one asked me once if I needed anything and payed everyone on time.&nbsp; My family is just crazy like that, they won't help even if you are trying to do something with your life.&nbsp; Well needless to say I could no longer afford to pay my storage so I lost all of my furniture and now I am going to have to buy all new stuff..&nbsp; Hopefully that just means it will be better than before.&nbsp;    I have had an unneccessary hard life.&nbsp; The things that I have gone through could have all been prevented.&nbsp; I mean I come from a well off family but it is a family that will stand by and watch you fail even if they have the power to make a difference.&nbsp; Isn't that ridiculous?&nbsp; I put myself through college and even had to keep a roof over my head.&nbsp; I have been on my own since I was seventeen and no one has ever bothered to offer a hand that would make a substantial difference in my life.&nbsp; I had to have my own apartment because my parents allowed my older brother who thirty something at the time have my room along with his girlfriend and son and guess what they have another child while they were living with my parents.&nbsp; At the same time I was working and trying to graduate and I no longer had a place to come back to and call home.&nbsp; Well needless to say I am still doing the same thing, maintaining a roof over my head, while my brother lives with my mom (almost forty now) and working to take care of me and my two children.&nbsp; I guess I am a true survivor.&nbsp; I just have to figure out a way to cut back on working so much so that I can spend some time with my children.

       I AM WRITING IN RED AND CAPS BECAUSE I HATE STUPID PEOPLE.    THIS IS HOW IT STARTED.&nbsp; LAST WEEK I SAW AN APARTMENT ON THE INET SO I CALLED AND SPOKE TO THE LADY AND SAID THAT I WAS INTERESTED AND IF I GOT THE PLACE I WANTED TO MOVE IMMEDIATELY.&nbsp; SHE SAID I JUST NEEDED TO GIVE $20 FOR THE APPLICATION FEE AND BRING A $500 MONEY ORDER TO HOLD THE PLACE.&nbsp; WELL I DID ALL THAT AND DID NOT GET THE PLACE.&nbsp; NOW I AM WAITING FOR THEM TO SEND ME MY DAMN MONEY.&nbsp; SO I CALL TODAY AND THE LADY SAID THAT THEY JUST GOT STAMPS YESTERDAY AND PUT IT IN THE MAIL. WTF?&nbsp; I TURNED IT IN ON FRIDAY AND IT IS NOW WEDNESDAY.&nbsp; IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE MAIL.&nbsp; THEY WERE EVEN OPEN ON SATURDAY.&nbsp; NOW I AM PREPARING TO MOVE INTO ANOTHER PLACE AND I NEED THAT MONEY SO THAT I CAN PAY THE RENT AND THE DEPOSIT AND HAVE SOME SPENDING MONEY FOR GROCERIES AND OTHER NECESSITIES.&nbsp; I AM SO PISSED.&nbsp; HOW STUPID CAN YOU GET.&nbsp; HOW ARE YOU JUST GOING TO HOLD ONTO SOME MONEY THAT IS NOT EVEN YOURS BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A STAMP. WTF?

      Well I am slowly approaching the last day that I will be working my current job.&nbsp; I have been here now for almost two months.&nbsp; I will be leaving I think the second week of August so that will be a little over 2 months.&nbsp; I am really excited about my new job which I start next week, it seems like it will keep me busy for at least 8 hours and I always down for some overtime.&nbsp; The next few weeks are going to be crazy for me because I am going to be working a total of four jobs.&nbsp; I start my new job next week, I will still&nbsp; be working here about 2 hours a day just to make sure the daily reports get done and the paperwork gets faxed, I also do promotions on the side but that is during club hours( that is the only fun in my life) and then I still work at the same part time job that I have had for six years at the bank but that is only on Saturdays.&nbsp; I have to find a way to cut back on the amount of work I am doing.&nbsp; So over the next few weeks or month I should have at least 4000 coming in which I don't think is bank at all it could be more but who knows.&nbsp; I guess you can say I am an workaholic but is that a bad thing.&nbsp; I really want to take the boys (Elijah and Jeremiah) on a trip.&nbsp; I know it requires plenty of money to take children on vacations so I am saving up for it.&nbsp; I have to find a place that is good to travel to during the winter months.&nbsp; Do you have any ideas? Well that is enough about work.&nbsp; I think I need to erase the post the I put up last week when I called my childrens grandmother and aunt hoes.&nbsp; I think I was rude and I don't know who reads these things anyways.&nbsp; Wouldn't want to start any unneccessary drama. I better find something to do because I am running out of things to talk about.&nbsp; See I used to spend my entire day here applying for jobs, but I have a job now that is paying well,&nbsp; so I don't need to look anymore at least right now.&nbsp; But in a few months I will start my search again because this job ends in December.&nbsp; I should just start my own temp agency and work all the jobs myself. LOL Just a thought nothing serious.

       I must say that I am bored out of my mind and believe it or not but I am at work and I have absolutely nothing to do.&nbsp; Luckily this is only a temporary position otherwise I would go insane.&nbsp; I do not know how the man that I am filling in for stretched this out to a full 40 hours but I can do his job in a mere two hours.&nbsp; Once I am done with my two hours of work I end up just surfing the internet for the rest of the day.&nbsp; Some of you guys may find that this would be the perfect job for you but believe me you would not like to be in a cubical for eight hours bored out of your mind.   Luckily I start a brand new job next week that requires a lot more work, I think and it even pays more.&nbsp; So I will see how this goes.&nbsp; Hopefully I will like it because it is suppose to last for four months.&nbsp; The position I am in now luckily only lasted for two, I could not have done this any longer.&nbsp;&nbsp; My new job will be in San Francisco so I wiill have to commute further but I will be able to carpool and just park my car.&nbsp; Therefore saving money on gas and toll.&nbsp;    I guess I am just rambling now.&nbsp; So I better find something to do.

      I sure did not want to come to work today.&nbsp; After such a fun weekend all I wanted to do was catch up on all the sleep that I missed.&nbsp; I must say that I did not do bad at all.&nbsp; I would say that I won a total of maybe $400 or $500 but I played majority of it back and spent the rest on my leisure activities throughout the weekend.&nbsp; Okay it might not have been that much but I only ended up spending $200 of my own and I did&nbsp; a lot.&nbsp; I went shopping, gambling, clubbing and ate whenever I had a chance and I only spent $200.&nbsp; So I had to win a good amount.&nbsp; I want to go back to Vegas soon or if not Vegas just any other vacation spot will be fine with me.&nbsp;  I think everyone had a good time though.&nbsp; We had some rocky moments but we worked through them and made the most out of a once in a lifetime trip.&nbsp; Well at least for the bride to be, you only get married once, well that's how it used to be. LOL Thanks to everyone who traveled to Vegas you guys all made the trip a lot of fun.&nbsp; Hope to do it again soon.&nbsp; I know for sure it won't be my wedding though. LOL

      After the events of this weekend I am so glad that I am getting a chance to relax.&nbsp; This week has been an emotional rollercoaster.&nbsp; After all the drama my children's father caused he has even agreed to keep the kids for me.&nbsp; I just want to be foot loose and fancy free.&nbsp; It is not very often that I get some time to myself to do what I please without having to worry about the boys.&nbsp; I am going to miss them though.&nbsp; Elijah always make me laugh and Jeremiah is as cute as a button. I hope I hit the Jack pot! I still have a lot of running around to do though before I can settle into that plane seat and let it whisp me away to the land where dreams can possibly come true or I just leave you broke. LOL Wish me luck out there because I am going to need it according to how my week has been going.

      I swear I am a very nice person.&nbsp;&nbsp;So why do I have to deal with the stupidity and the rudeness of others?&nbsp; I only called him this morning to let him know that I did not bring one of&nbsp; our sons over to his house this morning because I was running late to work.&nbsp; It goes from that to me being a hoe, yes hoe because I don't want to be with his pathetic ass anymore.&nbsp;  I overslept for one because he kept calling until at least 12 p.m. maybe even later but I put my phone on silent,&nbsp; mind you I have to get up at&nbsp;five o'clock in the morning.&nbsp; So I woke up late it is not like I am trying to keep your son away I just did not want to be late for work.&nbsp; I would have had to pass my job and sit in another 45 min worth of traffic just to get to his house then drive back to work.&nbsp; I would have been more than&nbsp;an hour late and he already is not supporting the kids so that would have been less money for me. He got so irate because I told him that I can not&nbsp;invest any more time in the relationship and I believe there is someone out there that is going to treat me ten times better than him.&nbsp; I think that right now we should just work at being friends and if any comes out of that than fine but until then I want to date.&nbsp; I said that nice right?&nbsp; I didn't completely close the window of opportunity and his response was calling me a HOE.&nbsp; What nerve of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;So my response was no I am nothing like your mother or sister.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was that wrong of me?&nbsp; Oh well I can't stand his mother or sister any way they are just as pathetic as him. Can you believe after all that he tries to keep me on the phone for another&nbsp;hour or two begging me to be with him and asking me for forgiveness.&nbsp; Does he not know who I am?&nbsp; I don't play that BS and I don't have the time anymore&nbsp;for his games or drama.&nbsp; You can go cry a MOTHER F&*^!#$ river for all I care I don't want you back.&nbsp; I swear he is either bipolar or something.&nbsp; Like Michael Jackson said, "Just leave me alone"!&nbsp;

      No he did not call me back, well he did but I am talking about a totally different call now.&nbsp; I recently applied to a Entry Masters in Nursing Program (ELMSN) and I just got a call from I guess one of the counselors.&nbsp; I have not completed all of my prerequisites yet but I do plan on doing so before I attend that is if I even get in.&nbsp; However most of the classes that I have not completed are Science courses and that is the main part.&nbsp; So now I have to figure out how&nbsp; I am going to complete some of them before they begin reviewing my application.&nbsp; I have to get into this program.&nbsp; This is my future as well as my children's.&nbsp; I have a back up plan if I don't but I know I didn't waste $50 to not get into this expensive A#! program.&nbsp; Okay I got that off my chest.

      Well my morning was off to a pretty dull and uneventful start, until he called me.&nbsp; I don't know why he has to interrupt my life on a daily basis, doesn't he have something better to do.&nbsp; After three and a half years he has managed to call me every day and at most he has missed maybe a month in a half, a day here or there.&nbsp; I am so tired of it.&nbsp; It is over and I don't want to talk to you everyday and there is not even a chance that I will take you back.&nbsp; Don't you understand that.&nbsp; Move on find another hobby or someone else to harrass with all your insecurities because I am not the one.&nbsp; It seems like when I finally made the decision to move on with my life, doors began to open up for me, there is no way that I can look back now.&nbsp;&nbsp;  If I take the right steps maybe my life will be in line like it was before I even met you.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is always going to be harder because I have two children now but I have adjusted and I have been doing it by myself for the past 31 months.&nbsp; I like to live a carefree life not having to answer to anyone except for God.&nbsp; He likes to ask the questions, "have you talked to any guys or got any numbers"?&nbsp; I am like just because I am moving on does not mean I am looking to get in the first relationship that comes along.&nbsp; I am not even open to dating right now.&nbsp; I HAVE TWO CHILDREN UNDER 3!&nbsp; DO YOU SEE ANY TIME THERE?&nbsp;  So this morning he asked me, "do you be chopping it up on the phone, and do they mind"?&nbsp; My response was you are the only one that calls because you are the only one that does not seem to realize that I am at work.&nbsp; Emailing is fine but being on the phone constantly to deal with an insecure man is something totally different.&nbsp; Maybe if you had something going for you other than me, when we were together, you would have some self esteem.&nbsp; I did not get to where I am over night it took a lot of hardwork, putting up with people's B.S., tons of school and nights that I did not know if I was going to make it through.&nbsp; Life is a blessing so take advantage of it don't just let it pass you by, because in the end you are the only one that will have any regrets.

      Well the interview that I went on yesterday went very well.&nbsp; So well that I just receive an email and I got the position.&nbsp; I am ecstatic.&nbsp; I don't know what to do.&nbsp; This calls for a celebration.&nbsp; I might just take the kids to Chuck e Cheese.&nbsp; I can't wait to get off work and call the office so that I can officially be offered the job.

      I have never done anything like this before but due to the advice of a friend I checked out her blogspot and just couldn't help myself.&nbsp; Also with all the drama that I am going to I need a way to let it all out. Today has been off to a fairly good start.&nbsp; Things are slow as usually here at work but hey I am still getting paid.&nbsp; I didn't have any childcare issues today either and that is always a plus.&nbsp; I could have did without the phone calls from my children's father but hey I am still learning how to deal with him, putting him in the past and keeping him there.&nbsp; I also got a very positive email from a job that I interviewed with on yesterday.&nbsp; I hope I get it. I really don't know what else to write you better believe that this is one of my more lokey days I am sure there will be drama to come.

      Sorry it has been so long but a lot of changes have recently taken place.  For starters I moved and now once again have my own apartment.  I started a new job two weeks ago that does not give me the time that I used to have to surf the net and I am attempting to start my own business.  So my hands have been really full. I am still making attempts to get out of relationship that is doing nothing for me.  I don't even consider it a relationship anymore.  How did I get involved with the most ignorant man walking the face of the earth.  Well that is not the topic that I wanted to take about.  I am on to bigger and better things and I just need to find a way to knock him off the wagon. I can't believe how one idea could have developed into possibly an entire business.  I am now in the process of getting my business cards made and hopefully everything else will fall in line from there.   urlLink First Listen:  'Summertime'  I don't know if you all out there watched American Idol this past season or not but I Believe by Fantasia has become one of my theme songs.  Just click on the link above and select "I Believe".  Hope you enjoy it as much as I have. I been checking back with you all hopefully real soon.  Hopefully I have some more free time on my hands.  Maybe I will be able to cut out that sixth day of work.

       Sorry it has been so long since my last post but witht the new job and all and the move I have really been busy. That is why I chose to write in yellow. There has still been tons of drama going on but all in all if I eleviate some people out of my life everything will be just fine. The hard part is just doing it and I don't want to make it seem like I am running from something by packing up and moving away but there are a few people that I just need to get out of my life. If any of you have any suggestions on moving on please post me a comment or two. I need all the advice on this situation as possible. Have a nice day and take care. Once again thanks for all the support       Had to make it orange instead of yellow because the yellow was not cutting it.

       I must say that my life has had its up and downs.  I also must say that I have been extremely blessed to have accomplished the things that I have over the years, but that is not for anyone to say that I am complaining or not happy with what I have achieved.     During some of my ups and downs their have been some very supportive people there for me and I appreciated all the helped offered.  However some of my downs were not always due to my own actions but I had to suck it up and deal with it the best way possible.   I think at times those around me forget my age and what they were doing when they were my age.  A lot of the things I experience now are a direct consequence of the choices that I made and I don't complain about those things.  I complain about the things that affected me that I didn't have a choice in.  Like my parents divorcing after 30+ years, or having to deal with a mother whose moods go up and down and she picks and chooses which child she is going to be friendly with.  I just don't want to be on the roller coaster.   I have too much that I am  striving for to worry about some one else's issues, so why worry about mine.   Thanks to all the encouraging comments, I needed them.  At least there are a few of you who can understand and listen without being judgemental.
