      Thank you all for you prayers and love.  We had some MAJOR breakthrough just within 14 hours after my last blog.  God is so faithful to us (His children).  We are such a blessed people.  Those who call him Daddy know who I'm talking about.  Well I will be leaving for Atlanta, GA tomorrow morning until Saturday.  I will however be leaving Audio Blogs on my site so make sure you check it out and listen to what God is doing in Atlanta.  I have been asked to assist the 2st Baptist Youth Pastor (Katie Cox) along with her adult and student youth leaders on a trip to "Church on the Street".  We will be staying who knows where in Atlanta, and going and ministering to the homeless on the streets in Atlanta.  This is a very important trip to me primarily because I was asked to go with them.  It is a little unusual for leaders from different churches to link up and do a trip together.  WOW,  God is doing something supernatural in our city.  There are a few pastors that are starting to pray and seek Gods face for what He wants to do in our city.  It is very exciting when different denominations get together and go before the throne.  Transform our cities oh Lord!!!  Most importantly, I want to thank God for just being God.  In control of all of my circumstance and my future.  I am so greatful for His Grace and Mercy, He is the Most Holy God!  Thank you for my congregation, and for my dear friends that would die for me, because of Your love in them.  God you are my God, and I will ever Praise YOU!!!!!!!!!!!

      Ya'll we are in need of your prayers.  We are going through an intense testing period, and we are trying to discern God's voice.  I am very excited about all of the awesome things God is doing since we went full-time as missionaries 3 months ago, and I see the immediate fruits of our labor.  Doors have opened in some major ways that have been a confirmation of going full-time, but on the downside, it takes a while to build up support (which I knew going into it).  I am a strong believer that where God's vision is, He will provide the provision.  I am also a strong believer in stewardship.  Now, I know that God is Soverign (in control of ALL things), even in the areas of finances.  My heart wrestles with the fact that God is providing provision (miraculously) in every area except finances.  Now, I have no problems believing for finances.  Matter of fact, there was a time when I gave everything I owned away to serve Jesus (cars, computers, T.V.s, stereo systems, $4000 diamond ring, etc).  I have no problem giving God ALL the Glory, cause EVERYTHING I own has been given to me by Him for me to steward.  When I gave up my Job, I got rid of my 2003 Cadillac Esclade, the day I got rid of it, someone gave me a 2001 Nissan Pathfinder (Loaded).  You see, I have no problem giving abundantly, NONE!!!  Where I need prayer is discerning TIMING!!!  I know that I have the favor of God on my life and ministry.  What I need prayer for is when I set my life before Jesus, and He provides all of my needs (which He has), but there is that stewardship thing.  My house payment was due on the 18th of July, and I don't have the money for it.  Let's get something straight!  I am not writing this to get some emotional christian to save the day, I need PRAYER!!!  I have to be a good steward of what God has given me, in all things, according to His will He provides ALL my needs.  When the bill doesn't get paid.  I have to look inward.  Am I being obedient, is there something in my life that I am not dealing with?  Have I missed the timing of the Lord?  Please know that I am not shakin' or lacking in faith, just sharing what is in my heart.  I just want to know God's will for my life.  I wanted to share this with those who care about my life, and obviously you are interested in whats going on in my life (or you wouldn't be checking my blog).  Please pray with us and share anything that you get from your Spirit (not emotion).  We love you and thank you for your prayers and love!!!

      As many of you know, I work out on the streets.  One of the areas that we go is to a place called Hospital Heights.  HH is a neighborhood with about 130 homes, and about 300-400 people.  HH is known as being the worst area in our city (drugs, theft, fighting, abuse, some minor prostitution).  In HH there are 4 known drug houses that are constantly moving and shaking all day.  Anyone that comes from HH is automatically stereotyped as trash.  Since we have been out there, I have found that to be FALSE.  These people in HH are some of the most loving and caring people I've ever met, the only thing is, they have been hurt serverly by the community.  These people have up great walls due to the fact that they have been mistreated by our community.   In Janurary 2003, we started a house church in a garage in HH.  Since then we have consistently had 15-35 people there every thursday evening.  Well the house church wanted to have a cookout for the neighborhood as an outreach to their friends of the neighborhood.  WOW, did GOD show up.  We had over 70 people show that would have never stepped foot into a bible study/church.  We fellowshipped, and just hung out and loved on these people (all ages), and it was just a great time of community.  God gave us an idea that we should take some food to the house next door, which has been know for drug activity.  So we did.  We took over plates of Hot dogs and chips.  About 20 minutes later, one of the main guys (the one who hasn't liked me since he met me, and the guy who just cussed me 2 days before) came over to the church and walk very aggressively through the crowd, came up to me and said, "Hey, I wanted to come over here and thank you for the food you sent over.  That was very nice of you guys."  Of course, when I first saw him coming, I have to tell you I was very unsure what was going to happen.  I saw a side of that man that many people probably never see.  I swear I saw his heart fully visible, genuine in all his ways, sincere to the depths of his soul.  I saw a man that I really liked.  This was a tremendous confirmation of Gods works here in HH.  It made my heart so greatful for all of the seeds that we have planted, and the increase that God was bringing through it.  It's funny what God can do with a HOT DOG!

      I must have gotten up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.  Everything is like slow motion.  I am sitting hear with absolutely no thoughts of anything.  Actually, it is very difficult writing this blog.  Anyway I'll press through.  I usually have one day a month (my time of the month) where all my fruit seems to be gone.  When I have to have a day just to myself, with little or no human involvement.  For any of you who know me, you know I love to be around people.  But during my time of the month, I don't want to talk or see anyone, I am depleted of all relational juices.  It's a good thing though, I get to spend a day resting in the Lord and soaking up the Word without the worry of people coming and taking the fruit off of my tree.  Don't get me wrong, I am a guy who loves to freely give my fruit to whoever needs it.  That's why Jesus gives us fruit, to freely give it away.  But guess what, today is all about ME!!!  Me and Jesus, I am gonna crawl up in His lap, and rest my head on chest and let Him hold me ALL DAY LONG!  I am so blessed that I am a child and not a slave.  I have the responsibility of doing my Fathers work, but at the end of the day (unlike a slave) I can walk right into my Daddy's throne room and get up on His lap and He listens and loves me, cause I'm His son!  WOW, what an awesome revelation.  Sonship!!!!  I love being His son, see I'm already in a better mood.  Just thinking about how much He loves me as His son...  It truly changes your perspective.  That's enough from me, I am going to the LAP of JESUS!!!!

      As I go down this journey of faith, I learn new and exciting (and sometimes painful) things about myself and God.  The big three (Purpose, Plan, & Timing) that must be in place for spiritual success and growth.  Of course, along the way their is our friend "the Process", that brings us to and through the big three.  As I go through the process I learn more about God's love and grace, and a whole lot more about my wicked heart.  I get busy in my mind and works and many times I forget to include God.  Then when I come to a wall, I say God what are you trying to tell me.  I sometimes hate the fact that I am intelligent, resourceful, self-motivated, a doer, a forerunner, a breaker, and of course so dog-gone good lookin' (just kidding).  It is a dynamic tension that I struggle with daily.  Using and submitting my DNA (how GOD designed me) to His process.  I am made a specific way, to not be that way.  For my own gain that is!  God designs each of us different and special.  Special in the way that no 2 people are the same.  I bless God for His process, and I submit to the process.  I don't want to be 10 years down the road before I realize that God has been waiting to use and bless me this whole time.  I need Gods chastening in my life, He knows whats best for me.  I am in the heat of the process right now, where the heat is being put directly to all of my person.  Drawing out the many impurities in my life, all the hinderences that seperate me from God.  Everyday one step closer to you Lord.  It sucks, but it's lovely.  Two extremes present and pulling, and somewhere in the middle is Truth!  Allow God to take you through the process, be refined by the fire.  It is worth it, all of it!  We must see the beauty of the process and embrace it wholeheartedly in order to get where God desires and had destined us to be!

      I was so blessed last weekend when I came into church and there stood Jack Hannum.  You see it didn't surprise me that Jack came to church.  Jack was a Pastor.  It wasn't because he was a fallen pastor, or back sliden in his walk with Christ.  It was because Jack is the Associate Pastor of 1st Baptist Church in New Castle.  Jack had never been to our church, and in my home town you don't see this sort of thing happen.  I excitingly said, "Jack thanks for coming, what are you doing here", and he said that he was on his last day of vacation, and wanted to visit our church.  WOW, a Baptist Pastor coming and visiting a Full-Gospel Non-denominational church.  You see, Jack is a forerunner in our community.  He is what we charismaniacs call a "BREAKER".  Jack has a deep passion and anointing to be a bridge builder to bring churches together.  I was so blessed to see Jack at our church, blazing the way for unity within our community.  If our cities are going to be transformed, we are going to have to get a revelation like Jack, that it is going to take a joint effort, not just one church to change our communities.  I thank God for Jack, his heart has taught me a valuable lesson.  So if you know Jack, thank him for his heart, and for his obedience to be Christ to the churches and people of our city!  We love you Jack!!!!!  So get out of the box, and play THE WILD CARD !!!!!!!!!!!!

      This is a word that we are just unfimiliar with these days.  With the lack of community and commitment in our society, we truly are a people who lack availability.  Sometimes I think that being an American is a curse, due to all of the activities that the world has to pull at us daily.  I sometimes wish I could move to that little town in "Northern Exposure."  I remember when I was working in my clinics full-time and a need arose, and I couldn't tend to it the way I felt I need too.  Just the fact that I was tied down to something that controlled my ability to serve someone else, really discouraged me.  I have to tell you all, now that I am in full-time ministy, I LOVE MY JOB!!!!  There is nothing more awesome to me then to be available to be used by God.  People miss out on sooooo much just because they won't make themselves available.  I'm not saying that everyone should quit their jobs and go into full-time ministry(unless that is what the Lord is telling you to do!), but there is a fulfillment that is beyond comprehension when God uses you to be a vessel for Him JUST IN TIME!!   For example, Saturday evening at 11pm I received a call from a 16 y/o boy from the neighborhood that we minister in frequently.  He was very upset, cause a girl he knew was getting ready to commit suicide.  He was very frantic and concerned for his friends well being.  I told him that we would be over immediately.  So I called a dear and anointed brother of mine, Chris Hanson and we went over to their home.  When we got there, she was crying and shaking and desperately in need of Jesus.  Chris and I talked with her for 2 hours, and at the end of our conversation, she agreed to get some help.  Sunday evening myself and my wife (Jessica), and Chris and Cheryl went to see her.  She was still a little shakin' and withdrawing from her drug addiction.  Currently, this 18 y/o girl is staying with us in our home so Jessica can continue to minister Love to her and to keep her engaged so that she is less likely to make a bad choice and go back to the drugs.  She is doing great and she is getting ready to have an interview with Teen Challenge, and hopefully within a week she will be off to T.C. It is funny how God will use someone if they will make themselves available.  For those who won't make themselves available, I find them looking at us in a very unique way, wondering why we do what we do.  All I can say to them is scripture, in Luke 7 it says "Those who have been forgiven much, Love much".   And believe me, I know how much I've been forgiven!!!  I think understanding forgiveness is something that is lost these days, but I'll right more on that later.  I love being available for the Lord, in whatever way or capacity that I can.  It's not out of duty, but out of dedication to His Love for me and for His children that are so desperately in need of His love.  We have to get that revelation, we may be the only Jesus that some will ever know!

      When I was growing up I never really new what life was all about, and quite frankly I didn't really care.  life was all about me and mine.  What I could get out of it or someone.  Boy was I wrong!  As I grow in my walk with Christ, I find that my heart and joy comes serving others with disregard for myself.  I look around today and I see so much depression, loneliness, and lost identity.  People desperately want to be significant in their lives, but they just don't know how to find it.  You see, the world determines ones identity by what someone does for a living.  We always ask, "So, what do you do for a living?"  This seems to determine so much in our society.  We try to prove ourselves based on what we do or have accomplished, instead of who we are in Jesus Christ.  The sad thing is the Church as a whole has been infected by this virus.  People have a hard time engaging in church without being a part of a position, or having a title.  I believe that God desires for us to have our identity through understanding who we are in Him.  We are made in His image, our example is Jesus, and we are joint heirs to the Kingdom of God.  Many of us are slaves to God, we think as long as we work and do things in the Kingdom, we will please God.  I tell you, God is not looking for slaves, God is looking for Sons and Daughters.  Him our maker and we the created being.  God delights over us (His creation).  He doesn't want us to be like a slave that does all the work and then retreats back to our servants quarters.  God says," My son/daughter, thank you for your work for me, now come on up here in My lap and tell me about your day.  After that I will hold you until you sleep, and I will tell you of all the great things I have for you."  God desires to have INTIMACY with you.  He loves you with a searching and conquering love, that brings joy into and out of the depths of our being.  That joy is what I seek.  The joy of dwelling daily in His presence.  The joy that changed my life!!!!!!!!!!!!

      On my blog entitiled "Wonder what they'll say?", I spoke of myself and Tom Preble (Chris Kelley went too) going out and asking some very specific questions to random people on the street.  First of all, we went to the mall and after interviewing 5 people we were asked to stop taping in the mall (liability in case someone went postal on us).  So we went to the village at BSU.  In our findings, we noticed that there were no two answers really the same.  We asked questions on Sin, Absolute Truth, and Trust.  I think the closest answers were based on trust, primarily because each person had been burnt by a friend at one time or another.  I have been doing a lot of study on the PostModern culture lately, and first and most importantly, there are no real definitions to anything.  Everything is relative to each individual person.  There are no absolute truths that apply to all people, nor absolute authorities.  On our journey, we found that this is very true with the people we interviewed.  We received an incredible amount of different answers in all of the questions.  Their answers were truly based upon their individual mindsets.  This was very disheartening to me, but in the same sense didn't surprise me at all.  It is what "Bob Preston" calls Dynamic Tension.  The battle between two extreme differences tugging back and forth at each other, and somewhere in the middle is the TRUTH.  I believe that there is a real identity problem in the world today, this is why there are so many definitions in society.  I mean, everyone desires to be significant, and needed.  Everyone wants and desires to be understood (as my friend Tom puts it).  Everyone is trying to find out what their individual purpose is for this life.  It is like walking around in the daytime with blinders on.  People that are trying and doing and being a part of anything they can find meaning in, but my question is, "is there really true fulfillment?"  I would think when someone comes into their purpose, and starts to find their own identity that there would be joy all over them.  Come on!  Look at Patch Adams, that man had been purposed in life to be a doctor.  The joy the fulfillment.  His job wasn't work, it was pure joy.  Something that he was passionate about!  Something that he was made for.  Do you see an abundant amount of joy in the world today?  NO, absolutely NOT!!!  I see a world that is frustrated and fed up with all of the crap that goes on in the world.  We live in a world without purpose.  Anything that has been created has a purpose.  A salt shaker's purpose is to hold and distribute salt.  Paper towels are created to wipe up messes.  Cars are created to transport things.  We have to start to investigate why and what we were created for, in that we will find purpose.  I will pose this however, we will never understand what we were created for, until we have a revelation of our Creator!

      Our church is really starting to get into cellularizing its people.  We believe that as you get larger, you must get smaller.  I mean, every organ in our body is made up of tissue, which is made of cells.  So everything in our entire body is cellular.  The smallest living organism, the human cell.  Singularly you have life, Multiplied you have a body, made of a variety of different tissues and organs (personailties and cultures).  There is something to say about being big, and staying small.  You see, when you grow you lose intimacy within your body.  The cells in the toe never get to hang out with the cells in the hand.  But the thing that keeps them engaged, is that they are a part of a cellular group that is very tied together in the toe or the hand.  Because of their involvement in the specific area of influence they are intimately engaged in a very important area that has function and purpose.   My beautiful wife (Jessica) and I are engaged in a cellular group every sunday evening called "Marriage Enrichment".  It is led and hosted by Mel & Melodi Gideon.  Last night I was sitting and pondering this organism, looking at when it started well over a year ago.  It started with 8-10 families every sunday evening, and since then has almost trippled.  When I look at this organism, I see people who are committed to intimately engage in a function and a purpose.  It's not just because there is an incredible spread of food there (but it doesn't hurt), It's not the way we all squeeze into a 12X18 room, It's not even all the joking and cutting up that we do (Although we to get pretty crazy at times), but it's the since of belonging, the sense of community that brings us together.  Just being a part of something that has meaning to our lives, the sense of being a part of a family that genuinely cares and desires to experience life together.  It is the lost key of society, the smallest function of a city "Community".  I set back in my chair last evening and I said, you know what?  This sorta thing doesn't happen very much anymore!  It's a very sad thing, losing a key that unlocks so many doors............................

      Today Tom Preble and I are going on an adventure to see what various people will say about certain issues in our world today.  We are going to ask some very pointed questions to these people to hear there thoughts on trust, sin, absolute truth, and community.  We are making a documentary for our church to show those of us who don't see what is going on in the world (with the breakdown of community) what's really the mindset of people these days.  I hate that there has been such a breakdown in the morals and values the were so present in the premodern era.  I guess in a way it will be better this time,  I know in the premodern era religious morality was based heavily on the Law and works, so I beleive the movement in the postmodern movement of Christianity will be based on Grace and Lifestyle, where our actual value is stated through our lives, and not our words.

      Last evening I went to a local church to share the vision of what we thought God was doing in our community.  I shared a video of all the research and resourcing we did before we even launched into the community.  When I shared the video with the people of this church, they were blowin' away by the amount of drugs that were in our community.  You see, Henry Co. (New Castle) has one of the most severe drug problems in the nation per capita.  So when I shared the statistics I could see that it was the first they had heard of this.    This is a sure sign that community really isn't community!  The community that we build these days are so disconnected in community that it makes me sick.  There are truly walls within the City, that seperate and disconnect and desensitize the people of our communities from the horrible things that are happening in our community.  We, as the body of Christ, have to make a change in our lives.  We have to bring back the value and importance of true community.  Unfortunately, we see this same disconnect in the majority of the church bodies of our community.  There is a definite disconnect between the churches of our community, instead of looking at our differences as strengths, we look at them as weaknesses.  And even within our churches are walls of "Clicks" that segregate us within our own family.  We have to set the example of community within the Church, if not, communities of Mormons, Jehovahs Witness', Wicca, and other cults will draw our brothers and sisters into an inferior and non Christian community.  It's time Church for us to have our actual value, being our stated value "The local Church is the Hope of the world".  Why would anyone want to serve a Jesus when they look at us in our defunk moods, and constant depression that offers no hope?  We have to get a greater revelation of "WHO'S" we are, so we can know "WHO" we are in Him.  Then and only then, will we be able to minister the "Hope of Glory" Jesus Christ.  No one cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.

      I wanted to state this only one time and go from there.  If you need to know this is "What we Do!"  The Dream Center is a non-denominational ministry that is a gift to the city of New Castle.  We are a front-lines ministry that gets out into the street and assesses the needs of the people.  We serve the same house/neighborhoods every week in order to develop relationships with the people of our city.   Currently, we are in an area called Hospital Heights.  The Heights is one of the "worst" areas in our city.  The mixture of drugs, poverty, and just an overall spirit of depression/oppression, the Heights was the prime candidate for us to launch in.  We will be celebrating our 1 year anniversary there the 1st week of Aug 03.  We have came to this neighborhood every Saturday for 1 year, except 1 weekend, we went to see the some of the 14 people that we have put in Teen Challenge (Christian Rehab Facility).  God is radically transforming HH.  We have seen over 40 people come to know the Lord in less than 1 year.  We have a house church that was started in a garage in Jan 03, and we have 15-30 people that come weekly.  We are so blessed to be used by God in this capacity.  We are getting ready to launch our METRO KIDZ (Children's Evangelism) at the 1st of Aug 03.  We were just recently given a 20' box trailer, and we are cutting the side out and putting it on hinges to make it into a stage, in order to be able to roll up in any neighborhood and do children's/youth services out of it.  We also just linked up with Westminster Center (Jeff Kundert), and we will be bringing in a food truck with 6000lbs of food every week to give out for FREE to the people of our city.  All of the Dream Center Ministries are non confrontational in our approach.  What we do is, go to the doors and say, "Hey, I am Robert from the local church, is there any way that we can serve you today?", and out of that we don't plug our church, or preach Jesus verbally.  What we do is BE Jesus through our service to them.  It is the easiest thing in the world to do....  This is the Evangelism for our times,  relationship evangelism, making our stated value our actual value, not preaching, but being through a lifestyle and a passionate love for Jesus, we are able to be a fragrance of love to a hurting city.  People don't care about your Jesus, or what you know about Jesus, until they know how much you care about them.  The one value of the Post Modern culture that I love, is the fact that they want to experience something that is real, not a crappy religion, but experience the love of a Savior.  This won't happen unless we experience this first!!!

      OK, this thing already sucks.  I just went to look at the templates and it erased everything I already wrote in it!!!  Anyway, this is my first Blog, and I was turned onto it by Bill Roberts (pastorbill.blogspot.com).  As I read his blogs I noticed the importance of blogging.  It seems to be a great way to journal your thoughts, as well as, communicate your thoughts and feelings to others that care.  My name is Robert White.  I am a missionary to New Castle, Indiana.  I have a lovely wife name Jessica, a 19 months old son (Judah Zion), and a baby girl in the oven due in late Oct (Zoe Victoria).  I am blessed beyond messure.  I have the great honor of serving the people of New Castle and our region.  It is so exciting to see what God is doing in our city and region, so much so that I look forward to every day and even my nights when God speaks to me in dreams and visions for what He is going to do in this region.  New Castle is a city in east central Indiana.  It is a small city, but has one of the biggest drug problems per capita in the nation.  The drug of destruction is primarily Oxy's, with a little bit of Crystal Meth, and cocaine.  Our desire is to see the banner of Jesus Christ raised in our city, not by preaching, but by living a lifestyle of the Love of Jesus to a hurting community.  The ministry that I work through is called the N.C. Dream Center, which is an affiliate of the L.A. Dream Center (Pastor Matthew Barnett), and our covering comes from New Covenant Worship Center in New Castle, Indiana.  I can't wait for you to hear all of the cool things that God is going to share with you through me on this Blog.  Get ready, I believe that you will be blessed in the upcoming blogs!!!!!  If anyone ever needs to get in touch with me, here is how you can:  Email:  NCDreamCenter@ureach.com Phone: (765) 599-HELP Add:  815 W. Western Road, New Castle, Indiana  47362

      One of the hardest things that I have had to get over is my perceived value of who I am.  I have always desired to be someone who made a difference,  was respected, and most of all, someone who has authority.  Through my 32 years, I have had many positions and titles that I thought defined who I was.  As I submit my life to Jesus, and start to look at His ways, I am gripped by a reality that my position or title doesn't determine who I really am.  Think about it, when you ask someone to tell you about themselves they immediately start to describe what they do, because that is how society defines who we are.  It is entirely based upon what we do.  So we go around with our important little titles and our twinkie badge and shout it from the roof tops (especially if it sounds important).  Believe me, I have been guilty!  The funny thing is, that in the Kingdom, EVERYTHING is the exact opposite of the world.  The world says, eye for an eye.  The Bible says, bless those that curse you, pray for those who despitefully use you!  The world says to do what feels good to the flesh.  The Bible says to not give into the temptations of the flesh.  The exact opposite.  And for identity, the world would say that what we do defines who we are.  Guess what?  Just the opposite in the Kingdom.  Our identity in the Kingdom is defined by who we are in Christ, not by the status of the world.  It's like this, Jesus' title isn't Lord, It's who He is.  It's not a position but a function.  Paul is identified as an Apostle of Jesus Christ, not the "Apostle Paul".  That is a title that we give him.  Pauls title isn't Apostle, that is who he is, or how he functioned.    Let's go a little futher.  You say, ok Rob, I am getting this a little bit, but isn't it your title or position that gives you authority?  I say only in the world does a title or position give you any authority.  In the Kingdom, it is a function of who you are.  Authority in the Kingdom is not something that is titled, but something that is given to you by another person.  When you get pulled over by a cop for speeding, you didn't call him earlier that week and say, I am going to be driving this route later, would you please keep me accountable for my speeding.  No, that is a position that he has been given, and it is his discretion who he pulls over and who he lets go.  He controls his authority over you.  But in the Kingdom, authority is something that is given to a person.  My authority in anyones life, is only as much as someone give me.  It has absolutely nothing to do with my position, but who I am and how I am perceived by any individual I have relationship with.  If I have no relationship with someone, the will be reluctant to give me authority to help steward their life.  Authority is not something the is taken, but it is something that is given.  Think about it!  The only authority that I allow in my life is that which I give to someone.  That is why my identity is only based on my revelation of Jesus Christ, and what He says I am.  Many people never get their because they look at authority through the eyes of the law and not through the eyes of grace!  I am so thankful that I understand who I am, not based on my performance or my works, but entirely on who He (Jesus) says I am.  WOW, what a load of my back, no more earning my way to the top, do ya get it now?  I am sure you do.  Here something:  There is nothing you can do to make Jesus Love you any more, and the good thing is, there is nothing you can do to make Him Love you any less!  Stop perfoming and start being who He made you to be!

      I wanted to personally thank the 1st Church of the Nazarene for bringing Mr. Pickle into town and sharing his testimonies.  I am personally touched and encouraged by the Grace of God that is on his life.  I was gripped by the stories he shared, and the truth that was revealed through them.  He is definitely a blessed man with a powerful message of how God can change a man’s heart.  It is evident that the Lord has kept him in order to use his testimony to change lives, and I know that there are lives being changed.    While listening to him speak, one of his statements really challenged me.  Mr. Pickle stated, “if we wanted to do something about the drug problem in our area, we needed to stop being scared of the drug dealers/pushers and snitch them out.”  When he stated this, I immediately had a check in my Spirit.  I have never felt the answer is for us to snitch on them.  So I prayed, searched my heart, and dove into the Word of God.  As I was praying the Lord revealed to me 2 Chronicles 7:14,   “if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.”  Our land is very sick right now.  It is sick with bondage and oppression like drug/alcohol abuse, poverty, hunger, broken families, and division within the Body of Christ.  What we need is to come together as “1” Body, seek the Lords face, repent for our wicked hearts, and then He will heal our land.  Only Jesus can bring change to a man’s heart, just as he did to mine.  It is only through a revelation of Jesus Christ that can change a person heart, and that is what it will take.  A heart change in you and me!  Please don’t twist my words by thinking that I am disrespecting Mr. Pickle, because I have the utmost respect for Jesus in him.  However, we must be very careful to take authority outside what has been given to us by God.  We must be wise as a serpent, and gentle as a dove, in how we approach this situation, because lives are at stake.  It’s not only praying for the down and outers, but I believe we need to pray for our City Officials and for the Law Enforcement Agencies just as much as we pray for the oppression and bondage in our city.  We must pray for all areas good and bad, and touch the heart of God by uniting in Love just as He desires His Body to be.  Then we will be used to radically change this community as Jesus heals our land!

      Wow, where do I begin this blog.  I have been ravished by my Gods Love for me.  It is truly changing my life.  I am realizing that as I give God more, the more  He takes, and this changes my heart to His.  It is a painful yet beautiful process.  I am so refreshed with His faithfulness in my life.  He is such a faithful God, even in my weakness, He loves me.  He cherishes everything about me.  Man that is good to know!  We don't serve a God who beats us down, but a God who is for us.  He is always looking out for our best interest.  Unfortunately, our twisted selffish minds don't allow us to see past our own desires.  It is very funny when I look back on the ways that I used to be and how immature I was even in my perception of who He is.  God thank you for being so patient with me.  Thank you so much for Your Mercy that is new every morning.  You truly are the God of Grace!  Ya'll listen to me, we have a God who adores us in every way!  That excites me.  There is nothing in the world that can change you more than a revelation of who you are in Jesus, and how much He truly Loves and Desires intimacy with you.  I am so Blessed, knowing that I am above all things, I am Loved by my King!

      I am so stinkin' tired.  We have been working overtime on the Block Party doing this weekend.  We are teaming up with Isaiah 61 Ministries (Donna Stephens), Westminster (Jeff Kundert), and a whole bunch of others which include my buddies from 1st Baptist Youth Group (YEAH).  I am so blessed to have brothers and sisters in the Lord be a part of this outreach.  God is truly transforming Hospital Heights (where we have been working for a year now).  When you sit back and watch, you can see the hand of God orchestrating something incredible.  He is pulling together His resources to change a community.  I am so greatful.    Anyway, I have PERFECT POWER today!  "His power is made perfect in my weakness".  I thank God for His power through the Holy Spirit.  So many Christians walk around with such defeat and weakness.  Many of them are ignorant to the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.  I am thankful that I have the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.  It is the POWER behind the fullness of God.  A free gift to all who believe and receive it.  It is like have a television plugged in into the source of power (wall socket), but never turning the power on inside the T.V.  The T.V. is hooked up to the power source (through our receiving Jesus as our Savior-being saved), but never receiving the power from the source through turning the T.V. on.  So many people never experience what life is like with the Power of the Holy Spirit.  If you don't have the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, seek it out through the Scriptures and allow God to change your life forever through the Power of the Holy Spirit Baptism.  You'll never be the same.  Trust me, I NEED IT!  We all do, in order to have victorious Christians lives that are constantly conquering sin, not constantly getting our butts kicked and staying bound by it!  Seek it, Know it, Own it!

      I was awakened to a new revelation this weekend.  It was the revelation of understanding the price Christ paid for all, and within the revelation was an understanding that it is our responsibility as Christians to bring Him His inheritence.  I know, you're saying, "what the crap are you talking about?"  I am glad you asked!  Christ was the ultimate sacrifice for all sin.  Saving us from eternal damnation in hell.  He paid the price of sin for all, and that is death.  Because of His death, His heart is turned towards us as His vessels to deliver to Him His inheritence.  What is His inheritence you ask?  His inheritence is everyone you come in contact with, and those you don't.  His inheritence are all who have been, are, and will be created.  He created all for a purpose, so He could have intimate fellowship and love for them.  So many of His creation don't understand they are His.  And many times, because we call ourselves His (Christians), many people never experience that they are His, because many times we really aren't fully His!  So what those who don't know Him see, is a lukewarm bowl of a person who only thinks about their needs.  This is not His heart towards those who don't know Him.  He has a desperate pursuing Love that persistently cries out for their souls.  How would you feel as a father or mother, if your son or daughter had not ever known you, or if they knew you, and they rejected you.  Some of you know what I am talking about.  You experience that everyday!  Just imagine if you were Jesus, He created all.  And the ones you reject as you call yourself a Christian (being Christ Like) defiles the nature and the person that He is!  Forgive us Lord.  For looking through tained lens.  Lord our desire is to see the way you see.  We must have your eyes Father, give us your eyes to see Your heart.  We are such shallow and selffish people Lord.  Please have mercy on us.  Show us your heart towards your inheritence.  Give us eyes of desire for what Your desires are.  Allow us to experience Your heart so we can be vessels willing to bring You Your inheritence!

      I really don't know what I am going to write in this blog.  I am just going to start typing and see what God does.  I went to a conference this weekend in Indy.  It changed my life forever!  The simplicity of the Gospel came alive to me when Shawn Bolz (whitedoveministries.org) shared.  You know we try to complicate things so much.  We try to get this deep understanding, like we figured something out in God.  We wear it on our shirts like a medal, and then we base our whole ministry on this revelation.  I have to tell you Shawn has done this as well, except this isn't some deep theological revelation of the Word.  It is as deep as it is shallow, as long as it is short, and as wide as it is narrow.  In a whole it summarizes everything up in just 4 letters (LOVE).  Yeah we hear a lot that God Love's us, but this was shared very differently.  It was a man who has been ravished by God's beauty, a man who was lovesick for his Bridegroom to come sweep him off of his feet.  Shawn truly had this fragrance (atmosphere) of Heaven on him.  His message was so simple, yet deeper than any revelation that God has brought my way.  I am drawn by the realness of this.  I am captured by the trueness of this.  I am left only to desire the same atmosphere in my life.  WOW, Jesus a beautiful Bridegroom, and I am His Bride.  Even in my weakness, He Loves me.  I don't think the church on a whole gets this, I know that my life has been changed forever.  My heart has been wrecked for less.  I have to have and know more about my Saviors Love.  Just talking about it makes it burn within me.  Living with the Atmosphere of Heaven in my life, what do you think God could do with that?  Miracles, signs, and wonders through anyone who will put themselves in that position, the position of being ravished by His Love.  It's coming guys, we have to catch this revelation!  I goto go!

      I was at a conference last night (Friday) called "Fire in the Heartland".  It was a conference on Prophetic Worship & Healing.  During worship I had my little boy Judah (19 months) with me.  As the music began to intensify, I began to dance with Judah in my arms.  It was a very intimate time with my son.  While we danced, we would spin around and around, and I began to feel the joy that Judah was receiving as we danced.  At that moment, the Lord touched my heart and showed me a glimpse of His heart towards me.  I began to weep as we danced.  The tears intensified the more I saw joy and laughter come from my son Judah.  I was moved to be changed forever with this encounter with my God.  I realized that the father was dancing His son, that was dancing with his son.  You see, the first son was me!  As I danced with my son, Jesus was dancing with me.  And as I experienced the Joy from my son, Jesus was experiencing the Joy from me.  There's nothing like touching the Fathers heart, and having Him smile down on you from Heaven.  No one will ever be able to take that away from me!  Thank you Father for the dance!

      As I search my heart, I see many wicked and lonely places.  Wicked in the sense that there are still so many wrong motives and selffish ambitions.  Lonely only because I refuse to allow God to go to the depths of my heart.  My heart is very shallow right now.  I have to get in line with Gods ways for my life.  I have to seek and understand this Love that pursues me so perfectly.  I don't want to be busy for busy sake.  God change my heart to Yours.  Teach me Your character and give me Your integrity.  Show me the intensity of how You Love Your children, so my heart will be purified of all the filth I feel in my flesh.  Only You know what the future holds for me.  Please Lord, do not increase me in any way until I am ready and wholly submitted to You.  I want to represent You, not Rob White.  I give You all I can, help me give You more!   (Please check out "My Photos", I want to introduce you to the Love that pursues me)

      I am one of the busiest people I know.  The sad thing is, is that it is my fault.  I read this article on Jordon Cooper Blog the other day that convicted the crap out of me.  The article went a little like this.    Christians pastors/workers are some of the vainest people in the world.  They get there identity from being needed.  They pack there schedules in order to make themselves feel important.  Look at Doctors, no one wants to goto a doctor that has an empty waiting room.  You see, our importanct in the world is based upon how needed we are.  A doctor who is busy all of the time is perceived to be an expert or the best in his field.  Many times you see this in the Christian world, where pastors are keeping such busy schedules with their flock, but neglecting their home life.  Do we really need to be so busy in our lives.  Many times we are so busy that even God gets put on the schedule.  This is a major problem.  I am sure that this wasn't word for word, so don't get upset.  But there is truth to us finding our identity in our work, even as ministers.  There is a rush that you get when someone depends and needs you.  Unfortunately, we as humans, feed off of the feeling of being wanted.  I know that I do.  I have to change.  My identity must come from a revelation of who I am in Christ, not by what others perceive me to be.  I had to repent to my wife the other day, and explain to her that I was wrong for ever putting the needs of the people above the needs of my home.  I have to tell you, she cried, because she has seen this and has been praying that God would reveal this to me, and He did.  Imagine her relief.  We all need a check in this area.  We all desperately want to be needed and understood.  But let us focus on the one who created us and understand how much He needs us, and how deeply He wants us to understand Him and His heart.  If we would only get this revelation, He would take care of all of the needs that WE try to be God in!

      I have had so many calls since the last article I wrote in the Newspaper.  Everyone is so excited, but no one knows what to do.  So I am going to share a story with you  Mother Teresa was on her way to a speaking engagement at a major convention center, where men and women from all over the world came to hear her wisdom of how they could help the dying and hungry people of their areas.  Unfortunately, she was running late to the meeting.  Thousands of people sat waiting for her to get there.  When she finally arrived, she came upon a homeless man who was hungry and weakly postured on the steps of the convention center.  Mother Teresa approached the man and turned to the other sisters and said, I am sorry we are going to have to take this man back to our hotel room and take care of him.  One of the other sisters stated, "But mother, we are already late for your speaking engagement".  Nevertheless, Mother Teresa helped to load him in the car, she took him back to her hotel, she bathed him, and the she personally fed him.  After she had taken care of the man, she then went to the convention center to speak to the people.  When she got there, everyone was very excited.  Then she spoke these words, "All of you came to this city to learn how to take care of the dying and hungry, and at the same time, each of you walked by the man that was hungry on the steps.  You want to know how to cure hunger and need of your city, you must met the need that is before you!" (Story told by Pastor Andy, Church on the Street Atlanta)  It isn't a complicated thing, all we have to do is open our eyes and look around.  There are needs everywhere.  So many of us see needs, and we do nothing about it.  We are so selffish with our time and resources it makes me sick.  You want to be like Jesus then do something, stop talking about it.  Give someone the hope that you have been given.  Maybe it's just through a smile, or giving someone grace who has offended you.  Maybe its seeing someone in need, and instead of giving them money for food, take them to applebees and then to Goody's and getting them some clothes.  Or maybe its just calling me 765-599-HELP, and we will get them the resources they need.  Do something, act like you are a Christian, stop talking about it!

      I have decided that this is the new moto for the Dream Center (Shut up, and do it!).  Very direct, and harshly pointed.  I think that the people of the world need a wake up call that is very direct.  I am seeing more and more that people who go to church call themselves Christians, but in reality, they really don't strive to live that way.  They talk about all of the things they should be doing, but they don't do them.  I don't know, I am sure it is a mixture of self-fishness, pride, hurt, past experiences, and many more.  People are just to busy for God.  I promise you that there are only 2 currencies that account for anything in heaven.  1.  Your Money 2. Your Time.  There is only one thing that the two of these (Money/Time) have in common.  Do you know what it is?  I will tell you.  They both represent your LIFE.  Your time is the only thing in life that you can never get back.  Your time is so precious, even your employers give you money for your time based on how much you are worth to them.  So when God tells you that your life is not your own, he is speaking of your Money and your Time, cause this is the only thing that truly represents the importance of your life.  God desires for us to give our life to Him in every way.  But what we say is, "OK God I will give you this area, but don't go there!"  We are such winey little kids, we live our micromanaged lives and when something doesn't go our way, then we cry out to God.  Come on!  When are you all going to get it.  God isn't interested in your failed attempts to run your life, so He can make it better and you'll just go back to your own ways.  He wants ALL of you.  Your time, money, thoughts, love, effort, gifting, heart, children, YOUR LIFE!!!!  He knows what is best for you.  He knows the plans He has for you, plans to prosper you, to give you hope and a future.  He desperately wants to give you the desires of your heart, but He will not do it if He can't trust you in your stewardship of your life.  He wants us to be able to give all things to Him, so He will get the glory for our lives.  Trust me, I know what it is like to do EVERYTHING on your own, I lived that life for 30 years.  Only in the last 2 years have I allowed God to really have areas of my life that He could have, and this is still a process I am dealing with.  But guess what, I am trying, and God honors our efforts.  Anytime that Jesus had an encounter with someone, whether it be healing a lepor, or radically changing their lives in some way, you know what He would tell them?  He would say, "Go and tell no one, but go and show yourself to them."  People don't care what we say, all they care about is what we do, and believe me they are watching.  So let me challenge and encourage you when I say, "shut your mouth, and do it!"

      u-ni-ty (yn te) the state of being one, or united; oneness; the quality of being one in spirit, purpose; harmony; agreement; unification; a unified group or body.  The bible tells us, "how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell together in unity".  Unfortunately, this is something that we do not walk in, YET!  I believe that God desires for us to make every attempt to come together.  Where I see the problem, is that everyone is trying to build THEIR kingdom instead of Gods Kingdom.  We have our priorities way out of wack.  We must allow God to change our hearts and motives, so we can experience the beauty of Unity.  I am so blessed to be a part of a group of spiritual leaders who are coming together every other week.  Putting down their agendas and schedules and meeting for prayer for Unity in the Kingdom and our city.  These brothers are dear to me, there lives encourage mine.  They drop their titles, positions, and doctrines to come together in Unity in prayer for our city.  You see, God doesn't really care about Bethany Tabernacle, 1st Baptist, South Memorial Church of God, Christian Missionary Alliance, New Covenant or any other church more than another.  It is not our doctrine that makes us any better than any other church or group.  The only thing that God cares about is that we love Him with all of heart, and that we love our neighbor like ourself.  I want to thank John, Dan, Jack, Mark, Ted, and Eric for being forerunners in the area of Unity.  You guys really move me, and let me know through your lives that God is ALIVE and doing something in this city!

      My heart is stirred with a multitude of emotions.  I am tired of seeing the people of Henry County in bondage and oppression.  I am distressed by the fact that my brothers and sisters in this community stay bound to drugs and alcohol.  I am broken by the 2 recent teenage deaths due to an overdose of street drugs.  I am sad that there is so much division in the Body of Christ.  Most of all, I am sick of people saying that they are Christians, sporting the T-shirts, wearing the WWJD bracelets, and making Christianity their stated value, but not living it out through there lifestyle.  It’s like someone going to the Texas Roadhouse and ordering a steak, and the waitress bringing them a can of spam, wouldn’t you be a little disheartened too?    You see, God has put the Church on this earth to be Jesus to our community.  The problem is, there is very little community within the Church.  We have over 150 churches in our community, and very few have any contact with each other.  Are we really building Gods Kingdom?  God desires for us to be Kingdom people who are members fitly joined together (The Body of Christ).  Coming together with our foundation firmly planted in Jesus Christ, and radically changing the face of this community TOGETHER.  We have to come together in this war of injustice that is keeping our brothers and sisters in bondage.  We have to mobilize our people to bring justice to the oppression in our communities, not the justice of the “law”, but the justice of “LOVE”.   We must unite in order to bring the full expression of Jesus Christ to our people.  Jesus didn’t come just for the Christians, but for those that live in the world. (John 3:16, For God so loved the WORLD that He gave His only begotten son) The local church is the hope of the world, let’s start "BEING" that!

      Hey everyone, sorry for such a long time away.  I have been in a process of soul searching.  Thank you all for your patience and prayers.  It's is so refreshing to allow the Holy Spirit to renew you from time to time.  Sometimes we get so busy that we forget about what's really important, ie:  Relationship with God, Wife, Children, then ministry.  God has used this time to reveal to me my heart, and how disconnected I had become, even from my family.  So know we are making plenty of time for family (keep me accountable).  Thank God I have such and awesome and loving wife.  She is incredible.  I am so blessed.   Anyway, God is doing so many cool things in our life, and we will be telling you all about it in the upcoming blogs.  Right now, God is having us to look foundationally at the structure of the ministry so we can withstand the storms of tomorrow.  God is so Good.  Kelly Boles just became our 1st graduate from Teen Challenge, she is doing great and she is very excited to get out and help others in need.  There will be an article in the Courier (Front Page) in the next couple of days.  We are very proud of her, and even more excited about what God is doing in and through her.  Also, for those of you who have loved ones or know someone who struggles with drugs/alcohol/or any other life controlling issue, a rally team from Teen Challenge will be at New Covenant (815 W. Western Road, New Castle) at 10am on the 5th of Oct, and also at Crossroads Church on S.R.3 at 6 pm that evening.  Please if you know anyone that struggles in these areas GET THEM THERE!  It will be life changing.  We love you all and please be encouraged in the Lord today, Jesus is Lord of all.  I want to give a shout out to my two little angels who brought us a truck load of food the other day.  Your love is so beautiful to us, thank you for your servant heart.  We appreciated and needed that more than you will ever know.    I will talk with you all very soon.  Tell everyone you know that I am back online, check it out, God is moving and He wants to use you to be His vessel!

      I am so tired of seeing things the way I do.  I hate it!  All we do is look at things the way the world sees things.  Isn't that pithetic, all we do is look at the negative in people.  We very rarely look at the postive or even the potential of someone.  It is funny for me, I can look at a drug addict, alcoholic, or someone battling with depression and I can see greatness.  But when it comes to my wife, or those who are close to me, all I look at is the weakness.  How ironic is that.  Someone who has a visual, fully apparent weakness has greatness, but when someone close to me does something small, it defines who the are as a person.  YUCK!    I need Your eyes Lord, the eyes that look past the critical judgements of my heart.  I need Your eyes Jesus so I can Love like You Love.  I must have Your eyes God, so I can have unlimited patience in my life.  Most of all God, I need Your eyes so I can see what I have to change in my life!  That's the real reason I need Your eyes!   Psalms 139:23-24   Search me, O God, and know my heart;  test me and know my anxious thoughts.  24See if there is any offensive way in me,  and lead me in the way everlasting.

      WOW, I just got some great revelation yesterday.  David Mallonee was speaking at our Church, and then at Aletheia later in the evening.  He teaches on Biblical Finances, not the prosperity message that we've heard before on T.V., but true biblical principles for Gods prosperity in our lives.  It was very freeing to me.  One of the things that freed me up the most was when he shared the story of Paul the Apostle.  He shared the power of his ministry, and how he was probably the most powerful minister of all times, and at the same time he worked part-time.  That's right, Paul the Apostle was a part-time minister.  He was a tent maker by trade, and he did it all the days of his life.  He was a self funded minister.  This excited me for many reasons and here is why.  1.  I hate to ask anyone for money!  2.  If I am working outside my ministry, then I am not bound to someone elses feelings of how I have to run the ministry because they are helping to fund it! (Like, federal grants or even people).  3.  I can still make my own hours and make time for ministry.  4.  I would have the financial freedom to get my debt paid off, and not depend on the big 10,000 dollar check.  5.  I can be an abundant giver  6.  All the money that comes into me for my support can be put into the Dream Center account for the Dream Center.  7.  I will be able to take my wife out to dinner when ever I want to!!!!!  These are just a few of the reasons.  You see, the point is not to be a millionaire, just to increase the gospel in whatever way we can, and while doing that we increase our lives too.  I know that my thoughts are very skattered but it is 7 am, give me a little grace.  I am blessed to know that my giftings outside of the kingdom, can still be used to increase the kingdom.  I'll write more on it later!

      Sorry everyone, I have taken a little time away to re-focus my life.  I have been so busy lately that sometimes I don't know whether I am coming or going.  But still, my God is faithful.  It's funny to me, even when I get wrapped up in me, and the things I do, He just looks down with a deep longing just to communicate with me.  WOW, what a loving and sweet God I serve.  He Loves me soooo much.  I am very greatful.    My summer has been a rollercoaster, mostly of what I have created, but there have been some ordained activities of God (thank God I don't miss it all the time).  As I look back, I look in the mirror and see a person that has so much passion and confidence in His God, that sometimes he overlooks the more important things in life.  Of course that person is me!  When I go deeper into the Heart of God, I see that we are a people that get stuck on the 2nd Commandment, and neglect the First one.  2nd Commandment, "loving our neighbor as ourself" trying to meet the needs those around us, and the 1st being, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all of your strength.  Even the best Christians get this turned around.  We are such a society that needs affirmation in the things that we do, we actually feel good about ourselves when we do good for each other.  For those of us who are servant junky's, we can easily get these two commandments flipflopped.  Trust me, I have to fight not to stay in that place.  I love to serve, I feel closer to God when I am serving and helping someone more than any other thing I have experienced.  Is that right?  I don't think that it is a matter of being right or wrong, but what is important is the motive of my heart.  The real question is, "what is the motive of my heart when I serve?"  Am I trying to fill my empty heart with doing good works, or are my good works and overflow of my 1st commandment devotion to my King?  Com'mon you know exactly what I am talking about.  We all have wicked and selffish hearts, even those of us who have the purest motives.  Thank God that His mercy is new everyday morning!  Lately, I have been going through a heart surgery (not physcial, but spiritually), and as God has been exposing me to my heart, I have been able to acknowledge that there are areas in my life that need special attention.  I am so greatful for the Processes of God.  Lord thank you so much for never giving up on me, thank you so much for your unlimited patience in my life.  You are such a gracious Lover of my soul.  I want to be a 1st commandment Lover!  I want to know God's Love in such a greater measure, so I can, in some small way represent the character of Jesus Christ.  God ravish me with your Love.  Please Lord, bring a greater revelation of your Love to me.  I need Your Love in my life, it's only through Your Love that I can live my life to Glorify You!

      God has really been stirring me in the areas of intimacy and fellowship.  In many ways they are individual desires, but also they lived out by sharing these gifts with others.  I have been so enlightened with the depths that God is desiring to take His Bride.  I just got finished listening to the "The 7 Perils of the Bridegroom Fast", by Mike Bickle.  What an inspiring, eye opening revelation about our hearts towards living a fasted lifestyle.  I am so encouraged by what the Holy Spirit is doing throughout the earth.  I am starting to see a people who are desiring to be a genuine representation of what Jesus has always desired.  Of course, that goes along side of my very limited and immature understanding of Who He is.  Thank you God for Your patient heart, and long suffering with me.  Think about it, God created us to be in intimate fellowship with Him, and then to share that intimate fellowship with others (1st/2nd Commandment).  I met this guy on PBR's blog, and his name is Thom.  I don't know this guy at all, but I can tell you that I love him.  Thom if you're reading, please know that my heart is genuine towards you.  I really enjoyed the conversations that we had.  What I see is that our current revelation of what is going on is defined by many factors.  Some of those factors are:  how we grew up, are social environment, school/work experiences, and even our past church experience (both positive and negative).  Many times our differences really aren't a differing belief, but most of the time our differences are merely communcitaionally.  The way we communicate our hearts is so important to God, and unfortunately he uses peoples personalities to bring those revelations through.  We must desire to be more intimate with each other, we must strive to live in fellowship with each other.  I need to learn to communicate better with other, not so much for my sake, but for theirs as well.  I shouldn't expect everyone to think the way I think, or understand the way I put things all the time.  There are some big differences even in locality, and ethnicity.  Wow, if we could only commune together, so then we would know each others hearts.  Thanks Thom, for keeping me accountable to bringing understanding to my words, because those who don't know my heart, might misrepresent it!

      As you can see, I have taken some time away from my blog.  I have been going through some deep introspection, and what I have come to understand is that I am incredibly unsatisfied with my personal walk, and with the face of Church as we know it.  As we work out on the streets, I realize that it is only through the deepening my commitent and understanding of who Jesus Christ is in my life.  I find myself looking at the immaturity of my heart and even in my love for the Lord.  We are on the 38th day of our 40 day liquid fast, and God has revealed so many things to me, mostly God has shown me the wickedness and the immaturity of my own heart.  It has been a very good revelation, don't get me wrong.  I know if I am going to boast, I need to boast in my weakness.  I have also gotten a new revelation of God's Grace in my life.  I love His Grace, it is only His Grace that allows me to do anything.  I am very excited about some new revelation God has given me from the standpoint of the fluidness of His Church.  I will reveal more later as God allows me to share it more.  I believe that He is preparing a wineskin that will greatly increase the effectiveness of His NT Church.  It is really exciting.  So stay tuned.  Anyway, I don't ever want to be satisfied with my walk, I desire to long after Him, and to pursue and prepare the way for my Bridegroom King!  I'll write more later!

      In today's culture all you hear are buzzwords.  It seems that in our "postmodern culture", definitions are no longer relevant, but in the same sense there are new definitions for definitions.  New words, and thoughts that don't "define", but they do.  It is funny to me to hear postmodern philosophists dialog and debate, about not debating.  It is truly the circle dance of the mind.    In the language game, philosophists use a process called deconstruction to break down a thought (Metaphor) or a word to it's basic possible understanding.  After that process, they feel that they can fully understand the thought or word.   What a crazy bunch of crap.  The word game only brings a greater level of confusion, and very little clarity.   On the otherhand, in the Scriptures God uses a series of layering that helps to build a beautifully elaborate picture of who Jesus is.  That is how we learn, through the Scriptures.   We use illustrious metaphors like:  the Cross, Vine/Branches, Living Water, Salt/Light, the Blood of the Lamb, and many more.  All of these are used to build layer upon layer the character and beauty of who Jesus Christ is.    It is a process of building poetic imagination and the true power of the Gospels.  The indentity of our Saviors Love, and His desire for us.  Layer upon layer of Faith, Hope, and Love.  The Love of our Father projected through the Life of the Son, and imparted to us through the Holy Spirit.    The miraculous creativity of our Father.  Always building, never tearing down.  Never bringing confusion, but bringing clarity, upon clarity.  The funny thing is, is that the Word of God is very simple, we are the ones who deconstruct it to try to figure it out!

      I was listening to a teaching by Mark Driscoll (Soularize 2003), and if any of you have heard Mark, you know that he is not one who candy coats things.  In his teaching, he made a profound analogy of how many of today's Christians view our God.    He said, "We treat God like He's a some sort of sky fairy.  He is like a pinata, and we all send our prayers up and hope we hit it, and then we wait and hope a lot of goodies fall out."  WOW, that was a profound statement to me.  Think about it, how many times do we look at God as this big sugar daddy in the sky.  Sure, many of us don't intentionally look or even act that way.  But lets think about our true devotion to Christ.  We sit back with our mediocre lives, and our busy schedules and believe that we are really spiritual.  Where is the generation that will give it all?  Where are those that God calls, and immediately they respond by giving all.  I mean, when I go out and I listen to people talk (even my Christian friends), God is rarely the center of conversations.  What I hear most of have to do with worldly issues, activities, and upcoming programs.  Lord, increase Your revelation in my heart.  Help me to boast on the fact that I know You!  Give me wisdom Lord.  Lord, you are magnificiant.  I have made You too small in my life, forgive me!  Lord, be magnified, and let me shout it from the rooftops!  Help me to view You for who You are, High and Lifted Up!  You are the Glorious Lord, the Famous One.  Be made Famous in my life, so I can make You Famous on the earth!

      Man there is nothing like the family of God.  I mean when you really encounter true geniune relationships with those of like precious faith.  We had our Church christmas party tonight, and we had such an incredible time.  I really love my family of God.  I am so grateful that they love me so unconditionally.  It is so nice to have intimacy with so many people.  I wish everyone understood this feeling.  I believe the world would be a much better place.  I want to say thank you to all of those who a put me and my family in a special place in their hearts, and given us the opportunity to grow in God Love together.  Thank you all for accepting me into the core of your hearts.  I love you all, and you have given me a great christmas gift, the gift of life and love.

      Value is a big buzz word that is constantly floating around in my head lately.  As I start to see the end goal of where God would desire me to be (in part of course), I realize that my values must change.  We have 9 interns at the Dream Center, and it is so incredible to me, how we can think we are on the same track, but in reality we aren't.  I am sure there are many reasons for this, but mostly I believe it is because of "value".  Have you ever had someone ask you to do something and you said, "you didn't have time for it?"  What we are really saying is, is that we don't really value what you asked me to do, therefore I am not going to make time for it.  Or even our spouses, we tend to not give them the grace that we would other people who aren't so close to us "VALUE".  We see them in a different way that makes us (or me) not value our wifes because we continue to look at them through tainted lenses, based on knowing their weaknesses.    We talk about this revolution, and how everyone is going to be "sold out", but the real result is when someone actually takes the stated value in their mouth, and applies it to their lives, and it becomes the actual value of their heart.    What can we do to make our stated value, become our actual value?

      I was so blessed to hear a life changing message from a brother named Paul Vieira.  In his message, he was speaking about the emerging church and what it could look like.  One of the analogies he used was that the emerging church will be amphibious.  (forgive me Paul, I am going to do the best I can) For example,  When we were in the world (without Christ) we were like tadpoles, but after we had a metamorphosizing experience through excepting Christ as our Lord, we developed lungs (the ability to breathe new life), and then have the ability to live in a completely new and exciting environment.  He said, "Much like a frog that can breathe and flourish both in water and on land, the early disciples lived naturally in two environments".  They lived with God/Jesus on the earth, but also lived perfectly naturally in the world.    These days the church treats the world (where they came from) as if they had leprosy.  Unclean, Unclean!  You see, it is perfectly natural for frogs to live both on the land and in the water where they came from.  Matter of fact, when a frog gets ready to reproduce, the frog goes to the bottom of the pond and burries itself into the mucky mudd and plants its seed.  These frogs don't reproduce above the water, but in the water, where they came from.  WOW!  So, it is perfectly normal for us who have been born again to desire and plant our seeds into the lives that are in the world/pond.  IT'S NATURAL, and God has made us that way.  (Thanks Paul for this beautiful analogy, it has transformed my life)  Two days after hearing this message, God started to stir me inside.  I couldn't get this analogy out of my heart, it drove me.  After two weeks, this is what God had given me. "THE POND"!  The Pond is the world, and it is perfectly natural for us to live in that environment, as well as, above water. (Keep tracking)  God spoke to me that He desires to have a pond that is filled with Lilly Pads (home fellowhsip churches/gatherings).  Within the Pond, we would start to develop "Pads" in it that we and others could rest (fellowship, Commune, Grow).  As more and more of the Frogs get this vision, more and more "Pads" start to emerge.  The cool thing about the "Pads", these pads are connected and get their source of life and nurishment from the bottom of the Pond, in the mucky mud (where we plant our seeds).   I believe that God is desiring to use this model as a way to help those of the water with their transformation of being frogs.  It is also a place where other frogs can hang out and experience life together, and then be released themselves and go back into the mucky mudd and reproduce after themselves.  Can you imagine,  thousands of "Pads" where those who have the life of Christ, bring those tadpoles into a non-threatening, non-churchy environment.  Where the goal is to commune, and experience life together.  "Pads" would pop-up all throughout "The Pond", and encouragement, edification, and life would be produced and reproduced as we and others went out to start their own "Pads".   This is a lifestyle that I believe God would desire for us to investigate, and implement!  We are starting our "Pads" for "The Pond" as we speak!

      This is a repeat post from Bills Comments I wrote a few days ago with a little added:  I feel that the church in general has become a great industrial/Assembly Plant.  Our plans and strategies our carefully planned out (which isn't so bad), the executives get together and have meetings about increasing production, we have our set schedules, and functions where production happens, when our members/employees don't show up then there is something physically/spiritually wrong with them (and we judge their health), we desire to produce a product that the consumer can and will desire to buy into, and then after it is all over, we go out the door and seperate ourselves from work/church and become what the world calls couch potatoes for Christ.  If were blessed, we get to plant a new factory of coach potatoes in another city, so we can teach them how to be successful at being lukewarm robots, never producing life, but reproducing a quality function.      What is Church really?  Let's look at this from a simple mindset (cause that is all I have). God tells us that if we, confess with our mouth that Jesus is Lord and we believe in our heart that God raise Him from the dead, then we will be saved". (of course that is a punctiliar salvation, see Bill I was listening). But if that is so, then the Sperma of God has been sown into our spirits, and we too become a new creation (Born Again). Knowing this, we must also see that Church is not a building, but an inhabitation of His Spirit. So we are the Church. If we are the Church, and God commands us to "go into all the world and make disciples", and we do that then through the Holy Spirit in us, we will help to make disciples, or inhabitations of the Holy Spirit, or even a more simple terms, a Church. So when we are imparting our lives into others through the love of Christ, we are also, being a vessel that God is using to plant a Church! We make Church good or bad. We are the representation of Christ on  the earth. This is a great responsiblilty. Thank God for his Grace and Mercy. When we strive to become 1st commandment people, then we will be able to make quality disciples. We must be passionate lovers of God, then we will be the Church that God desires to visit!  We must increase our devotion, and be a more accurate representation all of the time.

      What is a biotic christian? A biotic christian is an organism (vessel) that is a living, mulitiplying, and eventually has the ability to reproduce the life of Christ.  WOW, I love this term.  I believe that God desires us to be biotic christians, ones that give and inhabit the life of Christ, not to hold onto for ourselves, but to be fruitful and multiply.  Ones that desire to mulitiple ourselves (make disciples) naturally.  Naturally developing disciples is a product of life, experiencing life together.    I think that the Church in general, of course I am not talking about you or yours, but for those who I am talking about it is you or yours!  We look at church as a set time, place, and a function.  It is like taking a look at a robot and a human.  In one hand we have a robot that is made up of may diverse pieces, each one is put into place for a specific function, and when the robot is completely assembled, it can look, and function in many ways like a human.  But it isn't.  Although a robot can function and look like a human, it cannot reproduce after itself like a human.    I think that this is one of the shortfalls of the church these days, we are so caught up in function and structure.  We are so busy creating new and user friendly robots (activities), that we miss the essence of being biotic.  We get so caught up in the organization of the church, that we become irrelevant to culture, because we are not a life giving organism.  Since we were made in Gods image, it would benefit us to learn more about the human body and how it functions, there we will find the diversity, complexity, and simplicity of the Godl.    We are yet one body, members fitly joined together!  We need to learn how to play well together, functioning together in life.  Experiencing life together spontaneously, that is what a biotic christian looks like to me!

      My favorite season is the fall.  I love the changing colors and the way things have to die in order to become new again in the spring.  This happens every year.  Well, when I fall, it's the same thing but there's a slight difference.  I fall and it's a death that I die daily.    When I first heard the saying that we each have to die daily, to be perfectly honest, I hated it.  I rebelled against it.  I did not want to have to die daily.  I wanted to live, to love, and to develop in the life God gave me without having the pangs of death constantly on me.  What I couldn't understand is that the only way to develop is to revel in my "fall season."  I mess up.  SO MANY TIMES!  I'm only human, and not anywhere close to being fully cooked or finished in the kiln and firing process.    Monty said today that he felt like he had been taken off the Potter's wheel and is ready for what God has next for him.  That's where I feel I'm at.  I'm ready for the fire, I'm ready for the kiln.  What I didn't expect was how the fire would burn me.    Working with clay is one of my favorite things in the world to do, so I know what happens when a pot is fired and there is some kind of imperfection or an air bubble in the clay.  The pot becomes something different.  It can take on a different shape or, in the worst case scenario, it can break into a thousand tiny fragments.  Well, I'm in the kiln.  The fire has been turned on.  And there's been an imperfection revealed.  My bubble has burst.  Since I can't see myself through God's eyes, I don't know the extent of the damage.  Have I simply taken on a different form and am still usable?  Or are there pieces that need glued together?  Only time can tell.    This pot has become broken, I think.  And has fallen in between the spaces of the shelves.  What kind of glue is God going to use to put me back together?  Will it be a long process?  Will it be one of those 5,000-piece puzzles that takes even the puzzle-pro some time to figure out?  What I want to know, most, is how will He display His craftmanship?  Will He want to?  Yes, He loves to show off how creative He is.  But, will I want to be shown off?  How completely humbling to have to show my cracks where the glue has not quite made invisible.  And who will it help?  God, please use me.  Use as much glue as You can.  Just piece me back together so I can be filled with the Water.  Fill in the gaps so You aren't leaking out, but are POURED out onto Your people.  And keep using me to pour and to serve.  Just, please, don't leave me broken.  And don't let me hide my imperfections anymore.  Let me flaunt them like the battle scars they are!

      I was just on Bill Roberts page and blogging with his people.  He was talking about pendulum swings, how we find something out to be wrong and, instead of trying to find out what is right, we automatically think we have to "cross to the other side of the road."  For instance, when I was divorced, I assumed all men were bad.  This was only natural for a hurt human being to think, but it was completely wrong for a Christ-loving woman to think.  Afterall, Jesus is a man.  I was so busy hating men and thinking the worst of them, I almost missed an awesome opportunity to be ministered to.    When I found out I was lonely and no better off hating men than before since I wasn't healing, I went the opposite way.  I tried to find out what was wrong with me by having meaningless relationships.  I remember looking into each guy's eyes and trying to see what he saw in me.  Did he see ugliness?  Poverty?  Death?  Or did he see in me life?  Love?  Beauty?  It took me a while, but I realized I didn't even see anything in my own eyes when I looked in the mirror.  That was a revelation and I only received it because God smacked me in the head with it!!!!!  Girls, so often, are hurt by men and do one of these two things:  hate all men and are guarded for the rest of their lives, or think that it's their own fault they were hurt and search for answers in countless fleshly relationships.  Notice I used the word "girls" instead of women.  I was a girl when I was married and tried both paths after the marriage died.  More than anything, I KNOW that girls have to see men following after God with their whole hearts if they are going to have any faith in the male species.  So, now when I see a man totally in love with my God, then I'm encouraged.  There is hope for girls and there is also hope for the Church in America.  Revival will happen with the men.  They are the missing component.

           Lately, it's scary how much God has been directly talking to me.  And I do mean directly!  For instance, there was something very specific He told me to say to someone I didn't even know.  Thank goodness I did it.  What would have happened if I kept my mouth shut?        Coming from a church so divided in its thinking as well as its love, before I may have been hindered by my mind over-riding what God told me.  That's a scary thought.  But, and praise God for this, I am in a place now where worship abounds and isn't restricted.  The Word of God is taken as the "real McCoy" and not judged by the translator.        Freedom.  That's what Ms. Alliece said I would find when I came home.  I did.  And I am home.  *********Update********* I have a job now, praise God.  And it's amazing how He worked it!  I will be baby-sitting my nephews.  This allows me plenty of time to do whatever I can for the Dream Center and even the church, if they want me, and to counsel any and everyone who wants to talk!  Not only that, but I will be able to write.  REALLY WRITE!  Thankyou, Jesus, for taking my petition to our Father.  He heard me loud and clear!:)

      When I think of all the things God has brought me through, and all the things that are yet to come, I become confounded!  As if this past year hadn't been enough of a change and an adventure,  now God is bringing to life new things in me.  Scary things!  He is putting dreams and urgings in me that were, heretofore, unheard of!  Example:  God has given me a heart for teen girls, specifically ones that are going through major crises.  What I don't understand is why He has broken my heart for them while I'm still walking out my own healing.  I know, I know.  The only way He can use anyone is when they are broken.  I simply cannot put my mind around it.  I feel so insufficient for them and, as a result, back off from them.  My greatest fear is that I will lead them astray.  How many times have I heard that men should not ask to be teachers due to the responsibily and the greater judgement they will receive?  Christine Caine came to the Dream Center in June and I asked her this same question.  How involved can I be while trying to overcome the giant chasms in my own life?  She kicked my butt!!!!!!!  She told me I had no right not to be completely and totally involved with every person God led me to.  Now, how to overcome the fear?  And do not say that I should repeat that scripture...  "God did not give a spirit of fear..."  This is more than a recital for me!  This is hard and REAL!  Yes, scriptures help and that very one has helped me in past times.  But this is more!    God, give me the answers...  And the peace that will definitely pass all my understanding.  *************UPDATE**************  He did give me the answers.  He made me see it myself.  Funny thing is, He used someone else's blog!:)  He used the blog from Bill Roberts on Baggage.  God made me write out what I thought about people bringing baggage around with them wherever they go.  He doesn't want me to hurt.  I have to give that to Him, I have to hand over the baggage.  The scars are still there and, yes, I will still have to deal with the open wounds that are still there.  But, and this is an awesome thing, God has already been dealing with my pain.  Only, it's not mine any longer.    FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Rob told me to get on here and start writing, that it would help us keep each other accountable.  (The interns and other Dream Center people)  I'm guessing that I am supposed to write my inner-most thoughts and put them out there for any and all to see, read, and comment on.  Terrifying!  What should I write about?  Drama, suspense, romance, spiritual adventures...  There is a never-ending list of topics.  Hmmm...  I'll ask a question, then.    Where do you think I should go next?  To help in answering this, I'll give a little background.  I'm 21, have about a year's worth of college credit, divorced, and jobless.  I just recently got back from the St. Louis Dream Center where I finished a one year's intership doing inner-city ministries.  I JUST broke off a relationship with the man I was sure I was supposed to marry and still have the same assurity.  I've left my home church where I was not growing and have started going to a, certainly, charismatic church.  I don't know where I fit in.  Now, does anyone feel up to answering that question?  God knows that I have been pleading with Him to open a door somewhere.  All I get is,   'Be still and know that I am God...  '  Fun, huh?

      I haven't written about this weekend on here so far.  I wrote on my own blog site, but I didn't want to reveal all just yet.  Guess I wanted to hang onto it for a bit, for myself to enjoy and revel in.  But now, I'm ready to rejoice with you all, (whoever "all" is) and tell you what God did this weekend.  On Sunday, I almost didn't make it into church that morning.  We'd been out late from the radio program, WJCF 88.1, theG.I.G., and then I'd gotten a call from a friend in need of some help which kept me out about an hour and a half after that.  So, Sunday morning didn't produce the same bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Anna it usually did.  Nevertheless, I couldn't stay home.  45 minutes before I was supposed to be at the church, I hopped in the shower and hurriedly got ready.  Thank God I did!!!!!!!!!  The service was wonderful though for some reason, I wasn't as engaged as I normally am.  I generally take tons of notes and get a lot out of the service, knowledge-wise.  I couldn’t figure out why I was so completely relaxed and at rest during the service.  If anything, I should have been anxious and uptight because of the kids from the Block sitting with me making an unholy amount of noise!!!  In fact, several people had moved during the service due to the noise they were making.  They didn’t seem to penetrate the “trance” I was under.  I was at rest, that’s all I can explain it as.  When the speaker gave an altar call, before I knew it, I was up at the altar! (Apparently, I needed it more than my mind had thought I did!)  4 different people prayed with me!  That’s odd.  I guess I looked pretty prayer-needy!:)  Anyway, when someone was praying with me, they said I needed to let God unlock my heart!  As he was praying that, my eyes were not seeing the back of my eyelids anymore.  I was seeing myself in a vision.  (Before, if I had visions, they weren’t about me.  This one was!!!!!)    I saw my hand brush aside a curtain or a veil hanging over a doorway.  The curtain had been torn down the middle, from top to bottom.  Note: I pushed the curtain with my left hand.  When I walked in the room, it was this amazing room, lavishly furnished and beautifully done.  In the middle of the room stood a Man of such beauty…  He was dark skinned with dark hair and eyes.  And He was holding out His hand for mine.  I took it with my left hand: the hand that wears the wedding ring.  What I was seeing was the bridal chamber.  God had been waiting in my heart all along.  I just didn’t let myself look that deeply into my heart anymore and hadn’t wanted to find what was waiting for me there.  Stupid me, He has been waiting there all along.    This vision wasn’t scary or anxious or even overwhelming.  Like I told Rob, it was perfect.  That’s all I can say.  Perfect.  Afterwards, though, I became overwhelmed with what it was I really, truly saw!!!!!  The reality hit me like a brick!  I felt so unworthy, so unclean…  But in the vision, He had taken me just as I was, as I am.  He didn’t say anything.  He didn’t have to.  My mind simply couldn’t handle it.  Trebby came over and said something I knew God was trying to tell me.  Actually, I’d seen this girl over in a different row and thought God was telling me to give her a message.  I wrote it down and fully intended on giving it to her when the opportunity presented itself.  Unfortunately, she’d left by the time I came back from the altar call.  What Trebby said was what I’d written for the girl.  God was trying to tell me how much I am worth to Him, how much He adores me.  Hmmm…  Such wonderful stuff!  And then!!!!!  As if this wasn’t enough, Monday night at Cleansing Stream, I had some major break through!  We are dealing with the consecration phase of the class.  We were asked to write down all the things we felt God wanted us to consecrate to Him and then burn that piece of paper in a symbolic fire on a make-shift altar.  I’d done something like this before in St. Louis on a retreat with the other interns.  I consecrated Paul, my ex-husband.  I figured he was permanently consecrated.  I didn’t know you could pick back up something you’d let go of before.  (Found that out the hard way!)  Anyway, Monday night, I consecrated him again along with Jason, the man I thought for sure I was going to marry.  I meant this consecration with all my heart and was ready to be released from all the pain and agony of stressing and worrying about both of these problems.  Along with several other issues I won’t go into, I burned that paper and was released.  I am released.    Funny thing?  Pastor Eric and the video teacher from class warned we would immediately be attacked in the coming week with what we’d just consecrated.  The battle was to come next.  I just didn’t expect it to come the minute I walked in the door of my home!!!!  My father, not even two minutes after I’d taken my coat off and sat down beside him, said that Jason had been at the YMCA and came over to exercise with him chatting up a storm!  No way, Satan.  Not again!  I’ve given that over and he’s not mine.  He’s not mine to worry over, to think on, or even love.  He’s just not mine!    Well, what do you think?  Pretty amazing stuff, huh?  There is so much God has been doing lately.  And so much He’s changed.  It’s hard to even think what I was like just a few months ago, back in St. Louis.  I’m a different person.

      I know what you mean, Trebby.  Before I went to St. Louis or even had thought about going out there, I'd been asking God how to be a leader, a GOOD leader.  I was looking for all the training I could get and pestered my youth pastor I don't know how much!!!:)  God kept telling me, "Be still and know!"  I thought this meant He wanted me to wait for the teaching to come to me.  It took me going all the way to St. Louis where I thought these great teachings would change me into the right kind of leader to realize what God really meant.  Be still meant to shut my mouth from saying what it wanted and to shut my mind from doubting.  He had already made me a leader and had put in my heart and spirit the words me wanted to say.  I was already a leader, and a good one.  I just didn't walk it out in the Spirit.    I figured that the best leaders were learned men with round glasses at the tip of their noses, grey hair and all.  The St. Louis Dream Center showed me street-wise men and weirdo women who were my age and leading a church of over 2,000.  Leading is following.  We follow God and lead the sheep.  We have to just know that we won't make a mistake if we are walking in the Spirit and following God, His Word, and His path.    Be still and know, Trebby.  You are a leader.  You wouldn't have anyone following you if you weren't.  And that laundry list?  More areas for you to glory in.  God still has more work to do in you.  Be glad there is a list you can see and He has revealed it.  You could be walking around with a plank in your eye and hypocritically trying to remove the speck from eveyone else's.  Remember?  The only way I have been able to say any of this in TRUTH is because I'm still working and walking that out.  We all do, Trebby, if we are perfectly honest.  And we are all trying to get the "be still and know" part down.  It's a life's pursuit and mission to get that!!!!!  ********UPDATE********  Be praying for me.  I had an interview this morning with Anchor Families.  I so want to be working in a place like that.  It will show the world later on that I'm serious about starting a girl's home.  I also know a couple of girls there from my old youth group.  They were some of "My Girlz" and I would love to be in aposition to help them again!!!!!!

      Glory to GOD!!  I want to talk about this self-centered approach that I battle. God has things he wants to do through me but I am so self-centered, I respond, "I don't think I am trained. I don't think I am capable of doing  it. I have been of those self-centered people for my entire life. Then the moment I sense God is moving in my life, I break out my laundry list of why he has the wrong person or why the time is not right. Here lies the problem as usual, it is my perspective not God's. God knows that I can't do it! But he wants to do it through me. I wish to seek God's perspective every single time.   I can't take the initiative on my own, God will take the initiative every time when he comes to me, He will reveal himself and his activity. This is always an invitation for me to adjust my life to God. You will never be the same after encountering God. God -centered is the only way we will ever have the true revelation of God. I must learn to see things from his perspective. I must allow him to develop my character in me. I must allow him to reveal his thoughts to me. Only then will I have a proper perspective on life.  Can you relate with me here?  Treb

      It's about time, Trebby!  And you are most welcome here!  Your "adjustments" have been seen by us all.  (It's that transparency thing again!)  We see an amazing man changing into an even more amazing man, amazing MAN OF GOD!  Praise God, you are going through all of this now.  And with us.  There is a perfect timing and placement in your situation, you know that.  Be assured your love for God shines through your skin!  You glow, man!  *******  I wanted to go back and re-read some of the blogs I've put on here.  Well, honestly, I didn't WANT to, but I felt like I needed to.  (Not to mention that when people comment on something I've written, nine times out of ten I can't even remember what I've written that day!)  You know, it's amazing how much junk I've put myself through in this short amount of time.  And it's even more amazing to see how far God has pulled me out of the "muck and mire."  When I first wrote on here, I wasn't sure of anything.  All of my pre-conceived notions about what would happen when I came back to New Castle...  Let's just say they were trampled, crumbled, and pulverized!  (I say this laughingly, now!)  I was ready to save the world in a big way!  The training I'd been through showed me how to be strong and steady for God when I'd gone past all my physical abilities.  But it was in an environment already set up for success.  I was put into a working ministry with most of the kinks worked out.  And home?  A whole new ball game!  (Thank God!)  In St. Louis, I just had to worry about how things were going to get done in a certain amount of time.  There wasn't much time for personal evaluation.  True, there was a lot revealed while I was at my wit's end in the middle of a new fiasco which needed my immediate attention.  But, I didn't have time to think!  I was just reacting to situation after situation and learning from my responses what God needed to work on me next.  Here, back home, I've had more than ample time to catch up on self-examination time!  UGH!!!  I already knew what I'd been through.  I'd faced it.  But, I didn't think anything new had to be dealt with.  Like any other human being, I'd assumed the past was in the past and I only needed to deal with the future.  Well, if you haven't dealt with the past yet, then it will re-appear in the future.  I'm living proof!  Ms. Alliece described it as a giant wheel I was running in.  I'd made a mistake, hadn't dealt with it, and couldn't figure out why I kept having to deal with that mistake re-appearing.  She said I was on the same wheel and seeing the same rock stuck in the treads.  I had to either get the rock out, or jump ship and land on a different wheel.  My blog, "I don't know, yet," was a primary example.  I know where I am supposed to go, I just let my brain become confused and jumbled with doubt.    So, what do I do now?  Jump wheels?  Or get the rock out?  Which would you choose?

      Greetings,  I have been experiencing this thing that business people like to call "Deep Change".  I was introduced to God in 1994. That was about the extent of my experience until lately. I became very sick on October 11, 2003 diagnosed with bacterial meningitis. During this same time some very personal problems were revealed. (I am not very proud of) I was released from the hospital on Friday, October 17, 2003...Wow!Little, did I know the change that was forthcoming to this wicked heart.  I spent the next week in brokenness and for that, I will forever be indebted, unfortunately my brokenness came at the expense of my Wife and her heart. I spent one entire week crying 24/7 out of my shame and embarrassment. The awesome thing is my Jesus was there beside me, the whole time, his Love is Authentic, it does not change. The mercy and grace that God poured down on me was like a cup of hot chocolate on a cold night. It sometimes takes circumstances that are man made to reveal your total dependence on God and His will. I like to say "it is the best of times and the worst of times" I have discovered a new life and new purpose for this "Wicked Heart". It is to bring forth the Gospel of Jesus Christ!!. After trying to be all I could be. I have surrendered to Jesus and that means, doing all I can do with Jesus in my heart to convey that message to the other Trebby's of this world. I am not sure, what will happen in my personal life but one thing is sure, my Jesus. I know that some of you have wondered about my wife and wondered who is she? Why is she not with me? Well, my wife is an awesome woman that teaches 5th grade. We are currently separated because of my poor decisions. I hope you all understand me a little more now that everything is in the open. I have been Moving from a self centered life to a God centered life and this requires adjustments...Friends,job,family,etc. so please, keep us in your prayers, and a big shout out to my bro...The candy man! (haha)  I want to thank all of my new friends for your friendship and love.  Treb

      I'm finding that I like this "Cleansing Stream" class more than I'd anticipated.  Nearly everyone I met out in St. Louis went on and on about how much Cleansing Stream changed their life.  In fact, while at one of the pastor's houses, I met a lady named Carole who actually used to lead Cleansing Stream in New Castle!  I was in St. Louis, in a private home, and met a lady from New Castle!  How strange is that!  I'm smart AND stubborn.  This hasn't helped me like you'd think it would.  I have all kinds of head knowledge from reading the Bible, but the heart knowledge?  I guess I'm too stubborn and prideful to let it penetrate past the upper extremities and into the place it needs to be hidden the most.    I help people.    I can't help myself.    The prophet, Dennis, who came to New Covenant, hit this right on.  He said God was telling him all about how I needed to take care of myself and not everyone else in the world.  How do I do that when I don't want to?  And don't think I deserve my own attention?  Mindsets.  It's all about mindsets.  My former mindset, (and, yes, it is FORMER) is that I am not worth it.  I'm not worth my time or anyone else's.  So, I need to be helping everyone else to have SOME kind of worth.  Tuesday night and then again last night, my worth was re-examined.  What kind of God would be so lavish with someone He didn't think was worth His time?  What kind of God would think me worth it?  And Who would think me worth wasting on?  Lavishing on?  Any blessing I received from God, I would see it as a necessary thing He needed to give me.  There was something He was going to use it for and that was as far as it went.  I wouldn't see a blessing as something He simply wanted to give me, to bless me with.  A revelation on this came when I hit a crisis point this month and called my best friend.  God told me He didn't give me Craig as someone just to be there when I needed, but He gave me a friend I could talk to about anything and everything.  It was and is to be a relationship of friendship, and easy friendship.  I don't have to call Craig only when I need to or if I know I need to minister to him.  I can call him and just talk for hours about anything and everything.  This month has been one of the hardest of my life.  There has been so much transition and change.  AND ON TOP OF THAT!!!!!!!!!!!  God has been changing old things in me.  So, I've been talking to Craig a lot more than I did before.  Two o'clock in the morning, during his classes...  Anytime!  And he is there to talk.  I haven't really had that kind of friendship before.  I've been that person before, but in a counseling type of situation.  I haven't RECEIVED that kind of friendship.  God wants to bless us with so much more than we desire.  And He wants different things for us than we would ask for ourselves.  How long is it going to take me to get this entire revelation?  God loves me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Plain and simple.    What else do I not get, Lord?  Start cluing me in!

      Christy, welcome to life as a transparent piece of glass!  Getting all that out in the open is the hardest and best thing you can do.  Teens, people, are going to see it, anyway.  Better to put it into a way you want it to be understood.  And how awesome is it when you think that what you went through may actually help or prevent someone going through the same junk you went through?!?!?!  I think it's safe to say it takes a breaking point in us to get to transparency.  Tuesday night was certainly a breaking point for me.    I'd never thought of God as the Prodigal before.  Yes, I knew He lavished love and blessing on us way past our understanding and worth.  But, when put together with the parable of the Prodigal Son...  Man!  Powerful!  And I hit my breaking point.    For a while my emotions have been raw.  You know how you can cry so much that the tears stop, but you're still crying?  It's kind of like that.  I was so worn out, tears wouldn't even come anymore.  And I hated feeling that way.  I wanted the comfort of tears to wash out the impurities.  I wanted to feel the cleansing sensation only a good cry can bring.    You know what?  I haven't really cried like that since...  I can't remember when.  It was back in St. Louis, I remember that.  Yes, I've cried, but bitterly so over some really painful things.  I haven't cried those clean tears like Tuesday night.   I'd been crying out of sheer emotional reaction to situations, not because, I don't know.  It's hard to describe.  Ah!  I've got it!  I haven't cried or been overwhelmed by God's extreme love for me in way too long!  That's how I want to put it.  I would see people in church, especially at Harp & Bowl, and be so jealous of their open brokenness before God.  My own brokenness was different.  It wasn't because I chose to be broken before Him, but situations had broken me like a toy boat crashing against the rocks in a hurricane!  And I hated how selfish that made me!  I COULDN'T MAKE myself see how much God loved me and wanted me to crawl up in His lap and cry myself to sleep.  I could sing the songs of how great His love for me is, but my heart refused to understand it.  I was so hurt by circumstances that it took my tenderness away.  Not now, thank You, God.  Guess where my favorite place to worship is?  House Church in Hospital Heights.  I'm home, there.  That is where I can truly worship God.  Not in some nicely fabricated building with people who know God and how much they are worth to Him, but in a converted garage/church with God's "outcast flock" can I feel free to worship Him like He deserves to be worshipped.  If I could, I'd take every single person from my old church, one at a time, and bring them out to the House Church to see how God's children really worship.  It may not have the most technologically advanced screen and PowerPoint system, or even restrooms separated for men and women but it has something my old church is missing: it's purely humble.

      I have never posted anything before.  Mainly because I am not a writer and I am not all the excited to share my thoughts and feelings with others.  I have always been a person who stayed to herself and a lot like Anna I was depressed growing up!  I honestly cannot remember much of anything up to maybe 4 years ago.  I am 26 married with two kids.  Now you would think I would have a lot to remember.   I cannot even tell you what happened on my wedding day.  I was just so consumed with sadness I never thought I would be happy.   Then I found God. Yeah he has always been there but I never once turned to him for any kind of help until a little over a year ago.  I did not know he was there! I knew something was wrong, but really did not have anyone in my life who directed me where to go.  This past year a lot has changed inside me.  I have a huge passion for teens.  I don't want anyone to go through what I went through and have no body to turn to.  I am determine to let God use me in any capacity to do whatever he needs done so kids will always have someone in their lives they can turn to. I want them to feel the JOY that I now feel and the peace that I have.  The other day I was at work and I started to write in my journal.  Just now as I was reading different things on Rob's blog I felt God telling me to share my journal pages with you.  Now if my vote counted well lets just say I would definitely keep this to myself..  Its all about being obedient and stepping out even when you are uncomfortable.  Well here you go!!!!  How I feel I can't express with my mouth nor can I imagine with my eyes. It is a faith that nothing of this world can break.  A white light so pleasing and beautiful you can't directly look at it.  Its to wonderful to even begin to express.  You think its a love like you love your children, but its not.  Its a million times greater!!  When you love something with all your heart and you don't think its possible to love one more drop.  Then you realize your love has grown deeper.  You can feel a burning in your chest a pounding of your heart and you want to share the awesome experience but no one or maybe, just maybe one person might understand.  I just so desperately want to share and for someone to understand my joy, my love and my peace.  The best part to understand you are beloved!!  You are loved like this by your creator.  That God has this feeling about each one of his children.  Then I realized that I don't need anyone else to understand because I know my father understands my heart perfectly.  And in the end he is the only one that matters...  HE is the ONE TRUE LOVE!!!

      MY shield is not going to cut it.  Yesterday, in youth group, Christy was talking about the armor of God.  We're supposed to put on the armor every morning for a week and see what kind of difference it makes in our day.  (Who'd have thought God would use a 15 minute lesson to break through some of the thick skull I have?)  When she came to the shield of faith, something clicked there.  We were having fun pretending to put on actual armor when it hit me: I've been using MY shield.  What kind of shield was I carrying?  One of self-reserve, boyantly crowd-pleasing, and critically judging...  AND DEPRESSION!  In St. Louis, Ms. Alliece, my spitirual mother, asked me to write down 5 things I didn't like about myself and 5 things I wanted to change.  One of the things I wanted to change was to be able to go from depression to steady joy.  The most defining thing in my life has been dealing with depression.  Even as a child, I battled with keeping a core of peace and joy without it being shaken and jolted by outside circumstances.  What I didn't realize, the shield of faith is supposed to keep those poisonous soul darts from penetrating that core.  I'd made a shield out of circumstances I'd been through.  Duh!  This automatically means I will see and live my life as one already predjudiced against whatever came my way.  I was already afraid.  Depression has hit its mark because I knew it would! I knew depression would hit me, not from lack of trying to fight against it, but because I'd seen it come before.   God has given me the gift of faith for a reason.  I'd been using it to believe many different things for other people, but very rarely for myself. The very gift God gave me to believe wasn't good enough for me since I didn't believe I was good enough.  I've accepted lies from Satan that I'm not good enough.  My many failings are thrust in my mind to make me think I'm not what God wants.  I know, in my over-analyzing brain, that by myself, I'm nothing.  My heart doesn't get it.  I've been hurt, yes, and I'm tired of holding on to it.  My shield was made by using the pain to defend myself.  Never trust a man because I was hurt by a man.  Never write again because I will only be rejected like before.  Never trust myself when I think I'm happy because I will do something to screw it up.  I'm only causing myself more pain.    My shield has fallen completely apart and I find there isn't much else defending me.  My attempts at self-preservation have failed.  Your shield of faith?  Yep, it's pretty heavy!  I don't know if I can believe by myself.  Too many times have proven I can't do it alone.  Faith is the things hoped for, the things not YET seen.  I hope I will see me grown in faith.  In the meantime, the faith You gave me?  Will you make it grow?  Make me know that You are God, I'm not.  You are love and won't ever stop.  You never fail even if I always do.  You are my God.

      I don't have anything specific to write today.  I just wanted to get on here and praise God.  He's just so amazing to me.  And I don't do this nearly enough.    Besides the obvious, HE SAVED ME, He is God.    I drove around last night with windows down and hair flying out through the sun roof of my mom's car just looking at things.    When I first got my license, I did this a lot.  I would just drive anywhere and everywhere I could feeling the freedom of BEING ABLE to drive but also something more.  I was feeling the freedom of being able to live and serve God.  No matter where I go or what I do, I have that freedom still.    I know I won't always FEEL this way, but that same freedom will be burning inside of me.  I'll never be held captive by this world again.  The moment I was set free, I was SET FREE INDEED!!!!!!  My God is my Captivator, but also my liberator.  His captivation isn't demanded, it is asked for.  He asks if He can captivate my imagination, my thoughts, my dreams.  He is a Gentleman.  He never demands anything of me, but He asks.  That is my freedom.    I don't revel in the idea that my freedom is mine for the taking, but that it has been so graciously given to me without any price to myself.  Sure, I had to give up despair, sorrow, pain, agony, self-loathing, self-pity, and just general self-hatred.  God, that's just not a very fair trade, is it?    But outside of myself and my freedom, there is this entire other universe He dwells in of which I have no idea.  He's made things I will never see in this lifetime, people I will never meet, and places even the greatest scientist or explorer could never find.  And He made it just because He was pleased with it.  How many other "gods" of this world can claim that?  I think it is the Hindu faith that claims reincarnation, but I could be wrong.  (Spaced it for a second.)  Anyway, reincarnation means that they COME BACK to the same place they left.  They may come back as a "higher being" but they still come back to this defeated world and will still face the same end I will: death.  That's not exactly something I would look forward to.  What if they saw what I've seen?  Or something even greater?  A life free of having to come back!!!!!!  A life free of the past's sins.  India, when will you be free?  Ok, I'm gettin wordy.  Sorry.  I'll end with this.  My God is great.  And even if I didn't know it, He's still GREAT!!!!

      I was really impacted by the teaching tape this morning at intern training.  When everyone left the room and thought I had fallen asleep, I was actually thinking and praying.  I remember when I was in high school, I used to love to just be in God's presence.  At one point in time, I remember I would get up early to worship, study teaching tapes after school, and read, pray and worship right before I went to sleep.  I still love his presence, and at times can sit for hours just being with him.  It is hard to find the time now to do it daily, though.  Sure I read and pray daily, but I don't think that is enough.  On the tape he said, "Your ministry to God's heart is the only ministry that only you can do."  Everything else we do could be done by someone else.  The entire dream center could be done by other people, but no one can stand in the face of God for me or you.

      Hello,  My heart has been burdened lately with some stuff and I feel that now is the time to share. Who goes to heaven the good people? How do you quantify good? When it is good enough? Let's explore this together.  I was under the impression that only the good would make it to heaven and well, I was disqualified from that at about age Fifteen. I can remember believing that twisted propaganda for the most of my adult life. I truly believed, that my chance of being good enough to make it to that glorious palace in the sky had long been ruined, because of the incredibly bad choices made as an adolescent and adult.  Then it hit me, who is good enough to go to heaven, no one. You cannot be good enough to go to heaven, good is a word that has many definitions to many people. Good game Billy, Jimmy has a good Heart. Those two phrases have one thing in common and that is only the word "good".  The context of  how you apply the word good is broad and encompassing. I believe the word is used to freely and has become mundane in it's very nature. My point is that the word good should be applied in the appropriate situation and not thrown around like a medieval ball and chain to render people helpless. We must as passionate lovers of Christ spread the word to all people, that it is the FORGIVEN that make to heaven.  Trebby

      Working with the girls at Anchor Families is hard stuff!  There's a lot I can and can't do with them.  Thank God, though!  I can take them to church!  They are so hungry for companionship, love, and attention.    I totally can relate.  They are living in a house with people they would not have picked and are not required to love since there aren't family ties.  Actually, the ties they DID have with family were severed due to circumstances they didn't create.  It's hard.  One of the girls was just weeping yesterday.  She had misbehaved and had to face the consequences set up by the rules of a system not set up to discipline in love.  She wants so bad to be able to go back to her mom, of course.  And she fears she has messed up so bad she won't be able to go back at all.    How many times have I said that?  And to God?  And how many times have I been reassured there was nothing I could ever do to keep myself away from God if I didn't want to?  These girls, (and the boys, I assume) don't have that reassurance.  They don't know how to get that all-consuming love!  Ugh!  My arms just ache to grab onto them, hold them tight, and tell them all about this awesome Love that wants to wrap them up forever!    God, make the girls' home happen, quick!!!  They need to be in a home where God is shown off, leaned upon, and taught.  They need to see what it is to be a woman of God...  BELOVED!    Yesterday, while I was working, I sat and looked at one of the girls.  I saw that her face was missing something.  A few minutes later, I looked at one of the staff members whom I knew to be a Christian.  I saw what the young girl's face was missing.  While looking at the staff member, I could see what her face was like at peace with herself.  She was completely confident of being loved: by God.  The young girl, she didn't have ANYTHING in her life that was permanent, let alone love.  I couldn't see peace in her at all.    This description isn't exactly right.  What I couldn't see?  BEAUTIFUL, feminine peace...  A face that had a Lover.  Jesus.  That's better.  That's what I saw.  God, grant the speed to progress the house.  Let other people catch the vision.  (Especially those you have blessed with the $$$ for this specific purpose!:))  These girls need You!

      I was looking at this list Ms. Alliece, my spiritual momma from St. Louis, had me make up.  Here it is:  5 Things I Don't Like ABout Myself: 1.  My Mouth 2.  Self-Esteem 3.  Unorganized Personal Life 4.  Time Management 5.  Thought Process  5 Things I Want To Change: 1.  Depression to Steady Joy 2.  Dependency on Men for Self-Image 3.  Thought Process 4.  Organization 5.  How I Deal with Confrontation  I'm happy to say that God has been working miracles in these areas already.  And you know how it all started?  With Him MAKING me go to Ms. Alliece and TELL her all my junk.  I let every single thing out there, recognized it, and renounced it.  Cleansing Stream has a similar process, but Ms. Alliece started it all for me.    God, thank You for keeping me sane!  And thanks for working on me.  I know there is a lot to be done in order for you to get me into the right timing, frame of mind, and condition to be able to do Your work.  I'm just amazed that You'd even want to use a poor, pitiful wretch like me!!!!!!  Thank You!!!   ****Mini Update**** Whoa... This week has been hard!!!!! That's the only word I can think of to describe it. Hard!  Jason re-entered my life and I went to bits for a little while. Dad attacked me and I told him where I stand on everything. And I'm still here!  God, there is so much. So much.   I've been sick for the past 2 1/2 months and it's coming to a head. God, please heal me or show me how to GRACIOUSLY live with this. It's confusing me.  I don't ache for Jason anymore.  I don't fear being alone anymore.  And I know that since I've said that now, satan will try to attack me with those emotions, but I know how to deal with them now. Thanks to Cleansing Stream.  I'm not worried about not having a husband right now. I'm not worried about not being in Africa yet. I'm not even worried about not having my own place yet or a job that pays well. I'm just not worried. And satan can't take that away from me.

      Hey everybody, I just wanted to write a little sumpin'sumpin'!  I know, I don't usually scribe on this bad boy, but I have seen the light. haha  Anyway, I want to encourage all of you in the work that you are doing.  It is very obvious to many that God has His hand on our ministry.  The way He is exploding our ministry is sometimes a little overwhelming, but exciting at the same time.  I would ask that we would all continue to allow God to go deeper in our lives, that we would allow Him to ravish our hearts, so that it will not be us living but Him.  He has so many great things that He wants to do through us, and it is our responsiblility to make ourselves ready to fully inhabit His Spirit.  I am so proud of all of you, what a gift mix God has given us, I am blessed above all men to work along side such quality lovers of God.  Thank you so much for making my life so enjoyable as we labor in love together.  It is so important that we continue to seek humility as we see His greatness revealed.  We must stay meek, and contrite!  He deserves all of the Glory, and I know we will give it to Him.  Keep being radically violent, passionately destructive lovers of God.  Always remember, LOVERS MAKE BETTER SERVANTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Greetings,  I have been like a sponge the past six months soaking up every morsel the word of God reveals. Anna, you should continue to listen closely to what the holy spirit is telling you, regarding your spiritual gifting the one thing you do not want to get caught up in, is questioning that unmistakable transformation the holy spirit is wanting to make within you. I have always thought, I was a relationship person, but the context was strictly about business relationships. I have attributed my success in the business world strictly to "my ability" in gaining the trust and bonding with the people, whom I wanted to forge a new partnership with. WOW! Then it hit me like a ton of bricks this was God preparing me for the work he had planned for me all along. I am not in hospital heights for some unknown reason, God has dropped me there and through this experience, I have found that my heart is for those people. This is truly what relationship evangelism is all about, you see relationships are truly about people and nothing else not the next big business deal.  I love being with everyone on Saturday and going out an administering the grace of God Through Jesus. I sometimes get in my truck and take a drive on Sunday afternoon and inevitably, I am drawn to hospital heights and the surrounding area, I find myself thinking about certain people who have spoken to me with a concern or a problem, or I think about the person who seem to be desperately wanting something but just did not know how to articulate that to me.  I am so blown away by all that has happened to me in the last six months, it has been the best of times and the worst of times. I had such a hard heart towards people, that did not look a certain way or act a certain way and now I find my self loving all people regardless. God has done a quick and miraculous work in me, and I  praise him for that. Glory be to God!!!   Trebby

      Ok, I need to confess this.  Confess it and let it out there!  I haven't told anyone for fear it was me wanting this and not what God was telling me.    On several different occasions, people have prophesied that my hands would be used by God to heal.  (This is terrifying me to TELL people.)  Sunday morning, God told me to go and pray for this woman and I almost didn't, thinking it was just my mind wandering and not God actually speaking to me.  (I almost don't want to say anymore for fear that satan will try to dement my mind anymore than he already has!)  So, seeing in my mind's eye what would happen if I left and just walked out of church as usual, I went and prayed with her.  Please don't misunderstand me, I don't want to bring attention to the fact of this, this... prophecy.  I want to be held accountable for what I do and what I say, so I'm putting this on here.  And I want to make sure that my actions follow the Word.  What do I do with the nagging notions coming into my head?  They are doubts and definitly from the devil himself.  He's trying to tell me that I'm taking pride in this.  THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I FEAR!!!!  I DO NOT want this to be anything of me and that's why I haven't said anything about this until today.  The prophecy was first said to me long ago and I'm just now putting my faith into it.    Of course, I know that as soon as I put my faith into a new arena, satan is going to try his hardest to destroy that faith.  I just don't know how to cope with it right now.  Having so much internal tormoil over unrelated issues and coming into this new......  "calling," I guess you'd say, is making me question everything and every action I'm taking.    God, HELP!!!!!  That's all I know to say!

      When I said there was more, I didn't mean about Jason.  I meant about my dad.  I'm finally resolving some issues!!!!!!!!!  Sunday morning, I was completely ready for church and was actually in the car when my dad came out and said he wanted to talk!  Of course, I was frustrated since I was going to be late for church AND I'd had a horrible night and was not in the mood for an argument.  My dad took me inside with my mom and let everything out he'd been holding in.  As he sat there and basically degraded my entire existence, I was calm.  I was amazed beyond belief, but I was calm.  I was furiously angry, naturally, and incredibly hurt, but I was able to sit there and listen to it all until he finished.  On top of THAT, I was able to rationally reply to my father.  Dad was angry (and is still working on) with me about being divorced, going through financial crisis, moving out to St. Louis for a year without getting paid, and coming back to live at home again.  Sound like a lot?  Yep, it was.  My dad and I'd talked about most of this before and I thought we'd resolved it and were moving on.  Apparently not!  Dad harbors such resentment towards me, especially when I decided not to go back to college after the divore was final.  So, when he re-vented all of these things, I was righteously indignant!!!!!  I told my father that he was not following the Bible word-for-word since he STILL had not forgiven me!  I also told him he did not come about this whole situation the biblical way since he'd been telling my mother to deal with me and would never bring up the topic to me, personally.  He let it fester in his own soul, and now he was angry...  AT ME!!!!!  I don't mean this to sound disrespectful, but I let him have it!  I told him WHY I'd made so many mistakes and WHY I always searched for the answers in relationships with men EXACTLY LIKE MY FATHER!!!!  Understand, I told him I knew that I MADE those decisions and no other person could force me.  But, Dad also had to realize how much he influenced those decisions.  What I could not find in my father, I searched for in too many relationships that ended horribly.  I was looking for the love and acceptance I wasn't shown by him.  Encouragement, loving correction, and just plain THERE!!!!!!!  By the time I told him all of this, I was in tears and couldn't hold them anymore.  But they were good tears.  I was able to tell my father just where my boundary was with him now.  I am no longer dependent on his opinion of me and he can no longer affect my decisions as he did before.  I am a woman of God, and DAUGHTER of God.  True, I would love to be able to have a strong relationship with my father.  But, I don't crave or long for it like I did growing up.  I know who I am now, through running the gauntlet of trial and error.  It may have been the hard way to figure things out, but it taught me just the same.  I do not need Dad's approval anymore.  I know on my own what God wants for me.    Now, God.  Teach me how to honor my father in the purest form I can.  I cannot agree with my dad on very much, so teach me how to honor him without having to become dependent on him for my emotional behavior and decisions.  Teach me how to live dependently on You!  *********  There has been so much more that's happened this week.  I'd love to tell you guys more, but the words are too many right now.  I don't want to strain anyone's eyes right now!  If you want, you can ask me. But for now, I want to keep it just between me and God.  Just for a while.  It's a secret!!!!!!!!

      We are just as blessed to have you on board Sarah.  It is so nice to see the nieve young kid go off to school, and a powerfully focused and passionate woman of God come back.  We are excited about what you are going to do for the Lord.  As you can see Interns/Staff, God is bringing people from the N/S/E/W to help with our work.  New Castle is a seed bed for Gods anointing and power to be demonstrated.  WOW!!!  Just think, in 5 years we won't even be able to recognize ourselves, let alone our city!  City transformation is coming, and we are in the breaker stages of that.  Isn't that exciting.  I am so blessed to work along side such passionate and dedicated servants of the Lord.  Thank you all for making Jesus famous on the earth!

      Hey everybody!!  This is my first blog; how exciting is that?  I don't really have a lot to say (y'all thinking that's a joke, quit laughing).  I just felt like I should blog since I've been here a few weeks now.  I am loving it here.  I am so excited about working with the Dream Center and, what over the past few weeks I have discovered, an amazingly unique group of people.                        Rob, you have become an incredible man of God since I left for college three years ago, not that you were all that bad before, but now I can truly say I look up to you and admire your heart possibly more than any one else I know right now.      And, you still give the best hugs on earth.  Trebby, I love you so much.  I think you are just the neatest person.  You are so quiet, but there is so much power inside you.  I love talking to you and just walking the block.  Chris, I am just beginning to get to know you, but already I love hanging out with you.  When you smile, it fills the room.  Anna, Cynthia, Kristie:  You have all become good friends quickly and have helped make my transition to Indiana much easier.  I know that all three of you have incredible hearts for people and for God and I am loving getting to know you.  Everybody else rocks, too.  Working with the Dream Center is the most incredible thing I have ever been involoved in.  God has given me such a heart for the people of New Castle, I have been driving around some nights after work, praying.  I can't wait to start Metro Kidz this Spring.  We have such an incredible opportunity to affect a generation before they become involved in the same things as the generation before them.

      Ok, I only have a few minutes, but I've been dying to get this all out.  This weekend was...  Extreme.  I don't want to say that it was horrible, but it was pretty darn close.  It was definitely filled with twists and turns!!!!!  Last week, I knew something was about to happen, something was coming that would change up some things.  So, as a result, I was very unsettled and restless.  (It also didn't help that I'm adjusting to working 3rd's!)  And Saturday morning dawned after a sleepless night from work and left me with a definistley uneasy spirit.  I assumed it was because I'm a woman and over-emotional.  Nope, for once I wasn't just being hormonal!!!!:)  Something WAS up!  TheG.I.G. was an awesome show, and towards the end, I got a call from a guy who said he wanted to talk to Rob.  Well, I asked his name, "Will."  And last name, "Tester."  And asked him what the call was regarding, "It's an emergency."  So, I gave the call over to Rob not getting what the name was at first.  When Rob got off the phone, it hit me.  I asked him who was testing my will, in a joking way.  Rob told me to wait 2 minutes and I'd find out.  I was thinking it was Joe or Abram, someone who usually comes to the show with us.  I wasn't expecting Jason.  AT ALL!!!!!!!!!  For once, my mind was completely clear of him.  I wasn't wondering, obsessing, worrying...  I was totally involved with working the phones and computer.  So, when Jason walked in...  My whole being just dropped.  Keep in mind, I am the best actress I know.  (I'm not bragging.  I hd this performance to prove it!)  I kept it cool and ordinary.  (As best I could with my mind screaming and my heart wailing.)  He came in at the tail end of the show and got on the air with Rob and Marita for a few minutes and talked about First Assembly's youth group.  In between times, he asked about my family, how I was, what I was doing...  Nonchalant.  He goes to leave and tells me to say hello to my family since he doesn't get to see them very often.    He leaves, I break.  A flood of uncontrollable tears I'd been holding that whole time just broke me.  Thank God Marita grabbed me, or I'd have been running through the streets...  There's more, but I have to go.  The Passion tonight.  God, I need something.  More of You.  Less of me.  Show me.

      Hello,  I want to start by giving God all the glory!!!!  A couple of weeks ago a group of Jesus lovers prayed for my wife and I, out at Everitt's house.  My wife was preparing at the time for a surgery, that was complicated by the fact she has a rare enzyme deficiency that will not allow her to be put under by normal medication. She had the surgery and is recovering at light speed, the doctor who performed the procedure told her that "he has never had anyone recover as quickly as she has". Let me back up just a little, my wife let me pray for her also, now this might not sound like a big deal to all you happily married folk but for me, it was a huge step forward, considering where my relationship has been with my wife. (Translation: not to good) I have thought about what this Doc said and the more I think about it, the more questions I have. See, I am not surprised at her recovery because the power of God supersedes any medical abnormality, and with a bunch of Jesus freaks praying together in the house of a Man and Woman of God, how could the outcome have been any different. Getting back to the questions I have, and something for us all to think about, was this Doctor just being compassionate, nice or could it be that none of his other patients ever received such a powerful message from God, through miraculous healing. You see, I hope that is not true because if it is, what message do you clearly HEAR?. Something to think about  Thank you all for loving me, just as I am. God is working in my marriage and some great things will happen. I love my wife and have found an appreciation for her that I never new before. I am a work in progress but I know one thing, God will never give up on me and he will not give up on you either. (You know who you are)  God is good!!!!!!!!!!  Treb

      Hello!!  Today opened my eyes to some things.  A couple interns read there testimony.  Let me just say first of all.  GOOD for you!! You guys earned a deeper respect than even what I had before. I LOVE YOU!! See personally that is not something I want to do.  Especially after I realized the testimony I gave Rob was not really my testimony.  In a part yes, but it was missing SOOOOOOO many things.  Things that I just have started to remember again.  I had pushed them so far down that really they never bothered me.  To be honest I thought I had forgiven whoever because emotionally I am ok!!  It's weird even as GOD has revealed these things to me, I still don't believe they happened.  You know what I mean.   I KNOW they did but I am just not feeling it yet.  Its like I am in a certain place and someone is telling me all this stuff however its happening to them.  Don't get me wrong I have spoken them out loud and it make me sick to my stomach.  See that's where I am at right now!  I have NO clue how to deal with this stuff.  I mean REALLY deal with it.  Ok GOD you showed this stuff to me now fix me!!  I realized I am a very emotional person.  REALLY I am..hehe  I just don't show it to people as much!!  Yeah the fun laughing side of me I show ALL the time.  Its fun to laugh!  But the stuff that I deal with is not something I personally want to deal with in front of anyone.  I guess I am kind of scared that when God finally does say hey ITS TIME!! I am going to be around everyone and their Momma!!  I know I am like anyone else who needs prayer and help.  However I feel especially with working with the teens that when I am around them its NOT about me.   AND I know since this is how I feel about things GOD is going to show me in some way something about myself.    I also realized this HAS to happen so I can heal and be able to share.  I want to be able to have that testimony!!  The one that says I went through all this crap, but guess what!  GOD was there for me!  He healed me of everything and put people in my life to teach me what I need to know.  I have NO DOUBT whatsoever that is exactly what is going to happen.  GOD is going to stretch me in a way that is very uncomfortable to me.    I bought this book yesterday at a Christian bookstore in Indy!  Beauty for Ashes by Joyce Meyer!!  The funny thing is about six months ago I bought it for someone else.   I honestly did not think I needed it.  I am not completely sure I do now.  However I need something, someone to teach me what the heck I am to do.  The funny thing through all this I am not a wreck!!  I am still happy and full of Joy... Because in my heart I know my latter will be greater.   I am ready to jump in I just need help learning how to jump!

      I know what you mean about the roller coasters, Treb.  Staying off the ones I know will make me throw up is my problem!!!!!  As you guys now know, I have a job and I love it.  Due to privacy reasons for the girls, I can't write out a whole lot, but I can tell you that two of the girls have asked if they can get permission to start coming to church at New Covenant.  They had been going to Spiceland Pike but they just don't feel involved or included in a lot of things, so they haven't been going in quite some time.  We'll see what God does there.  I recently have had the urge...  No, that's not the right word...  I don't know.  Let's put it this way.  My heart has been aching for Africa unusually strongly lately.  I know this isn't the right timing, but I can't help but wonder if that time is drawing nearer.    For those of you who don't know my entire life's history as of yet, (give it some time :)!!!) then you don't know that I've been called to Africa.  More specifically, I've been called to Zaire, or what's now known as the Republic of the Congo.  Right now, there is a national upheaval with so many civil wars and uprisings that no missionary has yet dared enter the country for fear of their lives and those lives of the people they would be tending.   About 10 months ago, Dave Ohlerking, the president and founder of Children's Cup, an international mission program as well as relief program, visited the Dream Center.  He spoke to the church about the call and how to define the specifics of the call.  Along with several other men in the Children's Cup foundation, he has set up many different orphanages for children left alone due to parents dying of aids and other calamities and Dave told us about the severe need to minister to the natives without any sort of hope.  Don't misunderstand me.  While his message was eloquent and very moving, his fine speech wasn't what convinced me to go to Africa.  The call has been there since I can remember.  I just haven't had any idea how to fulfill it.  Dave may be helping with that.  A few months late, Dave came with two of his colleagues from Children's Cup who were workind in different countires.  They took all of the interns aside for a time of questioning since they are starting an intern program for those interested in African ministries.  They wanted our input on how to run an internship program and gave us the opportunity to interview them about what they do in Africa.  Dave already knew about the call for Africa I have, so he didn't really say much to try to provoke me into questioning, he said later on.  But I couldn't help but ask for as much information as I could about what was going on in Zaire and the status of the people.  It was so hard to hear...  God, help them!  But, anyway, after the interview, Dave and Dave, (a different Dave) and Ben took me aside and told me they would be honored if I would join their internship program.  I would study under them for a year, whenever I was ready, and then be launched into Zaire with their support and blessing.    God, why is this so heavy on my heart right now?  I've commited to THIS internship program...  After just going through a PREVIOUS internship...  And another one?  What's going on?  AM I supposed to go?  If so, when?  And how in the WORLD am I going to raise that kind of support?  You know the problems, God.  And only You have the RIGHT answers.  Any time You're ready to give those up, let me know!!!!!   *****Insert***** The reason I put this on here?  I need to hold myself accountable.  Especially when it comes to God's plan for my life.  I need to make sure this stuff isn't festering in me, like it has been, and then pops out in an unmanagable way.  I also know that getting this out helps me to think it through and let my mind process what's going on inside it.  Make sense?

      Greetings,  I have always identified my self worth based off my Job. I guess hiding my identity within my work made me feel warm and fuzzy. WOW!!! What a bunch of crap!. I have been driven by my job the last Fifteen year's with my emotions hinging upon my success or failure. Needless to say, what a roller coaster ride, when it was good, man was it good, yes, there is a but, when it was bad, it was bad. I had gotten so caught up in my job that all the really important things in my life became irrelevant...Wife,kids,house,GOD. I always knew in the back of my mind that I really had my priorities all screwed up, but was afraid to admit it, you know that thing they call pride. The moral of the story is a job should be put in proper perspective for what it is. It is not who I am, it is my means of supporting my family, I have made $10,000 a year and 80,000 a year it makes no difference, I was still miserable. I have recently been offered another position within our company, which will allow me to work closer to home and give me an additional 10 to 15 extra hours a week. I listened to God before making a decision and the answer I kept receiving was think about others before self, that has made my decision simple, I will accept this job and do the best job possible, but I refuse to become the job. I want to spend extra time with my wife and the ministry...Hopefully, those two will be bound together someday.  I love this journey God has me on, you know, it's like your favorite ride at the amusement park, you want to get back on as soon as the ride ends.   Treb

      Cleansing Stream...  I don't know about this class.    We are talking about unforgiveness and we listened to a teaching by Joyce Meyer last night in class.  (Suprising, I haven't heard that one.)  And she was telling us about how unforgiveness will block us from receiving our breakthrough.  Duh, I know this in my head, but another revelation came through.  (I need a new word for revelation.  There have been so many, it's lost its flavor.)    My own unforgiveness was against my ex-husband and all the other men in my life I'd allowed to hurt me.  There was unforgiveness against them as well as against myself for allowing them to do that to me.  And what have I been praying for?  A husband, a man of God to come along side me and lead me.    I need to write a letter to them, ALL of them, and ask for their forgiveness and to forgive them.  I don't dare do it.  What will happen?  Will the unthinkable happen and God reconciles my ex-husband back to me?  Or Jason?  Or anyone else I think of as dead in my eyes?  That is the unthinkable, the unimaginable, the horrible thing I dread happening.  Does this sound unrealistic?  My heart DOES NOT WANT reconciliation with any of these men...  And maybe not with myself, either.  I just don't know if I am actually willing to let all of that go and let those possibilities haunt me.  I've consecrated these things, even myself.  They are set apart and do not get int the way when I am trying to walk out my life.  The thing is, there is a bitterness there I can't overcome alone.    I've consciously forgiven the men.  I haven't myself.  What do I do?  I can't reopen those wounds for inspection again.  I especially cannot open them for the very people who inflicted them...  God, help.  Those wounds still haven't healed properly.  And I am desperately afraid of having to put a new bandage on an old wound.  What do I do?  How can You heal something I can't re-reveal?

      Hello all!! God has been doing a lot of changes in me the past couple of weeks.  I have had a lot of decisions to make and a lot of things that have been coming up.  Mainly attacks against me and what I should be doing.  The attacks of course are coming from the people that are closest to me.  Some of them are just in my own head and I am trying to figure it out.  Its weird because last night is when I realized I was trying to do it on my own.  At least I thought I was!  The same questions and situations have been coming up for a while and I have been so consumed with doing it the way God wants me to do it.  That it makes me question things!!  Does that make sense!  I so badly want to be in his will and do what I am called to do, however I am impatient.  I want to do more for people.  I don't want more things to do, I want more quality time with people.  Especially with the teens in the youth.  The funny thing is God is telling me I am doing what I am suppose to be doing.  I am exactly where I am suppose to be and doing what I can.  I think personally I just want him to equip me right now at this very moment with everything I need.  So I can start working for him.  I have not been on the block the past couple of weeks and I am really missing the people.  I want to help more and I think God is trying to teach me and get me to learn that the little stuff counts just as much as the big stuff.  I might be doing something that in my mind isn't a big deal, however I am  not realizing how much it means to someone else.  So I am feeling like I have not done enough.  Thank you GOD for working on me and through me.  I know I need a lot of work.    Sunday Eric was saying how he was watching The Passion and got that revelation of God's LOVE!!  When these men were beating Jesus Christ he had this compassion for the men.  When he said that I was like WHAT!  I wanted to jump into the movie and start beating people.  I was wanting GOD to punish them... Then by the time it was over I was like WOW!!  I totally get it!!  I understand Jesus Christ loved the people that tortured him like I love Jesus.   I thought I understood Gods love!!  Do you ever think you already had a revelation of something and then realized oppppss maybe not!  I want that and I NEED God to help me love like he does.   I NEED him to search my heart and pluck the negative things that I don't need to make room for all the wonderful things that are coming.  I am so ready for that I get so upset especially with my husband when he does something wrong.  I am trying so hard to show him that God lives inside me.  There are times though I am showing him that but deep down I am upset.  That is something I KNOW God is working on in me.  Then I am thinking WOW my heart is not in the right place in that area.  It does not matter how much I act like Jesus is in my life.. If he isn't in my heart its almost pointless to try!!  God help me not to be so hard on my husband.  Help me to get a BETTER revelation of your love!!! Hey I am yours and I am willing to do whatever I have to do to be your servant.  I am so excited for what you are about to do in me.  I know its coming and I know its going to be great.  That's the best part for me.  I don't need to see things to know that they are coming.  Praise God!!  Well those were some of my thoughts for the day..   Sometimes they don't come out the way I would like them to.  So I am not a big fan in sharing them..  Luv you guys have an Awesome week!

      Visions and dreams have been coming more and more each day.  Well, I asked for them, so what else should I expect?:)  No, really, God has been freaking me out lately.  Lots of things He's been showing me...  Frightening!  On Sat. night, I had a weird confirmation from God.  Back in St. Louis when I was debating on what to do next after graduation, I asked God to give me confirmation after the fact of making a decision.  I asked specifically if He would give me a dream and that dream would come true.  Make sense?  I wanted to know that if I was doing the right thing at the right time, then my dream would have been a confirmation.    I was sitting at the computer at the radio station with about 15 min. left of the program when I looked down at my hands and knew what else I was about to see and what the conversation behind me would be.  I'd dreamt about it.  Thank You, God!    I was so afraid that I'd made the wrong choice coming back home.  See, I had two amazing offers I'd turned down.  They would have been offers leading to great provision and prospering.  I could have elected to stay at the Dream Center and enter their resident missionary program and immediately become what I knew God was calling me to be: a missionary.  I would have been able to travel the world on different missions trips with a team of amazing people from Joyce Meyer's ministries and learned from them!!!  How cool would that have been!?!?!?!?!  The other offer I was made was to go to Alabama to an amazing church and group of people I already felt were like family after only having known them for a few days at the Dream Center.  They'd asked if I would come to their church and help start a campus ministry in association with their already growing college and career group.  They were going to pay room and board, transportation, and a small salary on top of that!!!!  And I was going to a place where I was desperately needed and wanted.  How much better could that have been?  I would also have had time to go back to school....   But I came home, much to the consternation of both interested parties.  I knew I had a purpose for being here.    I've had confirmation out the wazoo telling me I did not screw up.  This was right.  This was good.  I didn't fail this time.  The main confirmation I've had came on Friday.  I'd been praying for a job but hadn't been able to get ANYTHING, let alone the job of my dreams!  In fact, I was told I was over-qualified to work at Taco Bell!!!!:)  Funny.    My heart has always been to help teen girls in trouble.  My prayer was answered in this job.  I'm working at Anchor Families now, praise God!!!!!!  And I know two of the girls who live there.  They actually used to be "my girls" at my other church but had lost contact with during this last year.  And I know there are other kids I'm going to meet there who need to hear what God would say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Praise God!!!!  THis is my heart, this is my passion.  A Missionary is only a title and can live and work anywhere God sends her.    Guess I didn't screw up after all!

      Yes!!!!  It's about time some new revelations were shared on here!!!  I was beginning to think y'all didn't have time to share the awesome stuff (and even not-so-awesome stuff) God has been showing you.  I wanna be able to see your revelations, your growth as well as my own.  It gets a little boring reading mine!!!:)  These past few days have been great.  God has really been answering some tough questions I put before Him some time ago.  And, yes, even some answers on the possible "Mr. Right."    Someone recently asked me if I truly thought there was a certain someone specifically for me.  It made it sound like this person thought that there is a certain TYPE of person each different person is meant to be with, of their own kind, as you might say.  I totally don't believe that.  At all!  I honestly believe there is just one person out there meant to be with me and that's that.  He is made to compliment me in every way and I, him.  Our weaknesses and strengths will mesh together so that we fit...  Like a puzzle piece.    How awful to have the menality that there is only a certain TYPE of person meant to be with you.  That implies God only makes types of people and not individual people.  Who wants to be a type?  I enjoy the perfection of imperfection which makes up Anna, which makes up every person I meet. True, I may not LIKE the person, but I like the fact I'm not what they are, even in the same "class."  Thank God there aren't classes He puts us into.  But instead, we are "fearfully and wonderfully made."    So, my husband is "fearfully and wonderfully made....."  I like that.  Yep, he'll probably frighten me sometimes, hence the "fearfully."  And, yep, I will wonder about him sometimes.  That's the good part.  I won't be able to predict him.  He is his own person, made by God just specifically to fit me!!!!!  Thank God!!!!!!!  And WOOHOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      I have been bad about blogging much...sorry Anna...I don't always know what to write.  I guess sometimes I'm not really sure what the whole blogging thing is about, like what you are supposed to put on it and stuff. Lately God has really been stirring in me how we have the ability to bring change.  I was in someone's living room with Rob yesterday...I don't even know the man's name...he was depressed...he said he was worth more dead than alive...that he wasn't worth anything...Rob held him as this grown man cried in his arms...Rob told him that Jesus loved him, and wanted to change his life, give him hope...Rob offered to pray for him...the man said it wouldn't do any good...I just wanted to cry, hold the man, give him hope, convince him Jesus loved him. I was praying last night after I went home and was just talking to God, asking him what I could do, how could we begin to see the change in people like that man, and communities like Heights.  I was reading Isaiah 58, and I got it.  I had a new level of revelation about fasting.    Isaiah 58:6-12 reads:  "Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen:  to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke?  Is it not to share your food with the hungry and provide the poor wanderer with shelter --when you see the naked to clothe him, and not to turn aweay from your own flesh and blood?  Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard.  Then you will call, and the Lord will answer; you will call for help and he will say:  Here am I.  If you do away with the pointing finger and malicious talk, and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness and your night will become like the noonday.  The Lord will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame.  You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail.  Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings."  Wow.  I want to see those kinds of changes.  I want to see a community changed.  I am just crazy enough to believe that is what God wants to see, too.  Well, enough for tonight.

      Ok!!! Anna I will help you out and give a little update on what is going on with me.  In a earlier blog I wrote that God was showing me lost memories!  That it was like I was watching a movie and all this bad stuff happen to someone else.  I was feeling ashamed and guilty!  Like I said I was not a wreck, however I did not understand why God was showing these memories now!  Well as the weeks have went by I have remembered in detail a lot of things.  It really explains where the source of my depression came from starting at a very young age.  I can understand why I did not want to remember this stuff because it was horrible.  Anyway God was protecting me in a huge way.  By not letting these memories take over me or consume me!  Well I also went to the cleansing stream retreat!  As I was getting prayer God was revealing to me a lot of different things.  I was just like WOW... and like...oh yeah I forgot about that!  God was showing me new stuff as well.  I remember the first retreat I went to last year I had no clue what was going on.  I did not understand it really.  I realize now God showed me this stuff so I could be broke free.  He knew that right now in my life I have complete trust and faith in him.  So I never doubted for a moment that what he was showing me was for some purpose.  I just realized last night at work what happened.  I was set free!!  I am not feeling the shame and guilt anymore!  I had abandonment issues as well!  I actually had a lot of what we were praying for, some was worse then others!! Guys you have to understand something.... I have been thinking about how I was going to talk about what happened to me.  I knew I needed prayer, but felt like I was going to get sick everytime I went to open my mouth to talk about it.    I was even to the point where I was going to try to set up some kind of counseling appointments.  I knew I needed to deal with it, but I just did not know how!  Well last night I started talking to a friend and I felt like God was telling me to talk to this friend about what had happened to me.  I was like GOD... how can I when it makes me sick to even open my mouth to speak the words.  He just said trust me Kristie!!  So I did!  you guys... it was easy!  I mean easy!!!!!  I just talked to her and told her about what happened to me and she started to cry.  I told her that it was alright that God set me free. RIGHT then I realized I had been set free since the retreat and just did not know it.  You guys GOD is so AWESOME!!  I can't imagine ever not having a desire to know him.  He is the only person that has made me feel completely safe.  I have never had that before!  THANK YOU JESUS!!!!

      Not many people have been blogging lately.  What's the deal?  Anyway.  The continuation of yesterday.  There have been some major attacks going on since the end of Cleansing Stream and my newfound freedom has been gained.  MAJOR!!  The Devil has been workin over-time on my case lately.  Not a chance!!!!!  Ok, back to what happened this weekend.  Friday night, Kat came with me to Cleansing Stream and we both were looking forward to the time of worship and seeing what was going to happen at the prophesied "life changing event."   Neither one of us had ever been to one, so we didn't know quite what to expect.  The worship, though we came in a bit late due to a site problem, was awesome!  They had a guy come over from the Indy House of Prayer.  Amazing!!!!!!  But, we didn't have much time to worship since we came in right at the tail end.  The session began and they immediately started with what we were expected to see that night.  They would talk about certain demons and strongholds that could be binding us, tell us what the sypmtoms were of that demon or stronghold, and then they'd have us repeat a prayer of repentance, renouncement, and breaking.  After we prayed the prayer jointly, we all came up to the front to be prayed for by the leaders of the session.  (There were about 25-30 workers in all, intercessors and prayer partners.)  EVERYONE came up to be prayed for, no matter if we felt like that was something we dealt with specifically.  The prayer partners prayed with us in agreement that the demon or stronghold was broken and was demanded to flee.  They also prayed that God would fill that void left with His love, comfort, strength...  It was awesome.  Ok, now that you know the general scheme of things, here goes what happened to me.  One of the areas they first talked about was the spirit of unforgiveness.  I knew and had known for quite some time that God was dealing with me here.  I was STILL finding it so hard to forgive my ex-husband.  But more than that,  I still couldn't seem to forgive Jason for what he did.  And harder still, I couldn't forgive my dad for not being what I needed him to be.  So, we prayed the joint prayer and went up to be prayed for.  Joe had been sitting by me and had come in even later than Kat and I, so we chatted for a sec in line while we waited to be prayed for.  I KNEW I needed to concentrate back in on what God was doing right then, but I kind of ignored it.  (Alright, I'm chicken.  I didn't WANT to deal with the tough stuff just yet!)    Well, when I got up there, some serious stuff was dealt with and that spirit was demanded to let go of me.  GOOD DEAL!  I went back to my seat and Joe was there again, so I chatted with him and started trying to disengage myself from what was going on...  Yeah, I'm a chicken........  God decided to call me on it!!!!!  WHO'D  A  THUNK!!!!  The service was interrupted because one of the prayer partners had a word from God saying that someone needed to move and get away by themselves so they could give their whole mind and attention to Him!!!!  She asked if we would move if we felt like that was us...  Nobody moved...  And then she decided to pray and get on to the next part... I got up and moved, alright?!?!  I moved to the back and got alone with God!!!!  I was the only one who moved!!!!  HA, HA!!!  Thank God, He made me move!!!!!  Because the next area was the spirit of rejection.....  MAN!!!!!!!!!  That was hard.  Really hard.  Pastor Eric was the one who spoke on it and I just couldn't stop those big 'ole fat tears from soaking the front of my shirt.  I was weeping, guys.  And hard.  Rejection has held my heart for so long, it was second nature to feel rejected.  In fact, I didn't know until this weekend what it was to be accepted, truly, by another human being.  Honest!  I'm not exaggerating.  I did not feel accepted by anyone and felt I'd been rejected by even God...  Why had God rejected me and left me alone when I was with Paul?  Why did He let me get hurt by so many men in my past?  Why did He reject His daughter?  Oh, gosh!  Did I ever have to repent of that, y'all!!!!  Big time!  When we said the prayer, even a repeated prayer was hard to get through.  Then time came to come forward for prayer and the same lady who prayed with me about the unforgiveness got me again and prayed with me....  Ugh!!!  HARD!!!!!  I don't want to tell everything just yet about what happened during those prayer times.  It was intimate and I want to leave them as that for a while...  Just me and God for a bit.  But, it was something every person who feels like they've been left waiting for someone to come and take them home realize that they've always been home.  He's always been there, we just pushed him as far away from us as we could.  WE had rejected ourselves, and God.  The night went on and then it was time for Saturday!!!!!!  WOOHOO!!!!!!!!  Talk about some freedom!!!!!   My big breakthrough was when they talked about the spirit of abandonment...  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Tough stuff!!!!!!!  And not only did I have abandonment issues with my dad and the other men in my life, I had abandonment issues with the child I lost.    Yes, it's time I talked about it.  I lost a child not long after I was married.  I'd felt such guilt about the miscarriage, guys.  You don't understand.  I WANTED, more than anything, for that baby NOT to live.  I didn't want it to have to endure the abuse I was seeing, hearing, and feeling...  So, I wished it would leave me, it would die.  I'd thought that meant I had murdered it in my heart.  What I didn't see until Saturday was this: I felt like the baby had abandoned me.  It left me just like my husband did.  This may not make sense, but this abandonment spirit had such a firm grip on my heart and soul, it had me convinced that even the baby had abandoned me.  Oh, guys!  There is so much deception out there just waiting to grab our souls!!!  Don't let it start!!!!  Not even one drop of it!!!!!!!!!!!  I went up to be prayed for about that and it broke off.  Finally.  Not long after that, the leader of the retreat asked us all to close our eyes for 60 seconds.  She wanted us to think of one thing we would do if we didn't have a single ounce of fear around or in us.  I thought about it and I remembered what I wanted to do when I was first saved.  I wanted to sing, to dance, and to play the piano for God!  In front of His children, no less!!!  And not be afraid to praise Him like I absolutely wanted!!!!!!!  And, you know the drill, we prayed about it, and the guilt, the shame, and the condemnation LEFT!!!!!!!!  I ran to the back and let my feet do the leading!!!!!    I danced, guys!!!!!  I DANCED!!!!!!!  And this isn't the end of it!  Now that I've danced and now that I'm free, I can't be caged again.  I don't care if this bird is subjected to blights and bouts of whipping wind and storm, this bird it going to FLY!!!!!!!!!  I'm free.  I can't help but keep saying it.   I AM FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Set free...  Wow.  Set free.    There's so much to tell and so little time to do it.  I wanted to get on today, really quickly, and ask you all to pray for me while the rest of my deliverance is coming to fruition.  But, guys, I am set free!!!!!!!!!!

      Yep, as Joyce Meyer says, "New Level, New Devil!"   I'm livin, walkin proof!    Remeber how I said that I was being tempted with three different opportunities to settle?  Yep, they are still trying to come back!!!!  Satan is just not giving up!  He knows I was tempted before, but he also saw that I resisted the temptation!!!!  Ugh!!!  Yes, I can resist this once again.  And yes, I will!  But, God, he has no right to try to come back in again.  I've told all three of the men that I am just not made for the kind of life they would give me.  I'd never be satisfied and would probably make their lives living HELL in the process.  That wouldn't be fair to me or them.  And yet, they keep on comin!    I turned off my cell phone for this reason.  (This and the fact that it came with a bill of almost $300 for one month!!!!!)  The voice mail is still working, for some odd reason, so I've checked it to see if some of my girls have called it instead of my home.  And guess who has been on there?  The three temptations!  (This sounds like some kind of 50's rock band groupie story!)  Lord, get rid of them!  I don't want anything in my path except what YOU bring to me.  Nothing, Lord!  I don't need distractions or temptations.  I NEED more of Your love and reassurance surrounding me.    Don't get me wrong, folks, I know I screwed up by letting those temptations affect me too much.  But...  GRR!!!  STILL!!! What's the deal?    Satan must know that my real hubby is on the way...  Ah!  That's it!  And my hubby is such an awesome man of God that it's got Satan panicking and trying to set up every single pitfall he can!  WOOHOO!!!  Praise God, then!  And Satan can't do anything about it!  My man of God apparently is so strong in Him that he's coming quick!:)  I'm in a weird mood, y'all.  In case you hadn't guessed already.  I've been fighting demons in dreams and in some of the people I've been working with.  My methods and train of thought have become a little unorthodox because of the warfare!:)  SATAN IS GETTING HIS BUTT KICKED!  Praise JESUS!!!

      I only have a couple of minutes before I have to be at work, but I needed to get on here and write for a bit.  My calming moments before the storm!  Trebby...  You are in His hands.  And He is your Father as well as your God.  Be still and know He is God and nothing in this world is for certain.  NOTHING!  My God, your God is bigger than any situation this world or any of the people can throw at us.  He is our Watchman and Guardian.  Prayin for ya.  I have seen new fruits and I have also found the new responsibilities that lie behind them.  I'm in charge of more as far as what God has sent me...  That's frightening!  Especially for someone who all her life has prayed for a simple life.    When I was born, my mother went through 81 hours of labor.  My dad went through one.  Mom and Dad didn't tell me this until a couple of years ago, but they have always said they knew before I was born that I was called by God to do something for His kingdom.  And since I can remember, I knew I WAS called...  And I prayed for a simple life instead.  My dream was just to be a wife, a mother, and live on a farm with no other responsibilities or demands on my life.  That's all.  Just me and my family living out our lives.  What God showed me later on scared me!!!!  Yet, there was always this desire, this hidden and supressed urge to see where God was taking me or what adventure He had planned...  Hmmm...  What if?  What if I followed God?  Where would I go?  Who would I meet?  What would I see?  Miracles?  Angels?  Demons, even?  Who knows?  But I was finally ready to find out.    I still have to fight off the want to pray for only the simple life.  I guess, deep down, I know I'm too complicated of a person to be satisfied with anything less than complication!!!  Ha, ha!  I want the unexpected, I want the unseen...  I want the adventure of not knowing my next step.  It's scary.  But the reality of being scared of the unknown is nothing.  God already knows!!!!!  And He's revealing His secrets to me gradually...  (Sometimes TOO gradually!)  And I know my hubby-to-be is going to have to be just as adventurous as I am!!!!!!  (Wink, wink!)  God is good, y'all!!!!

      Hello,  It has been some time since I last blogged and a lot has been going on in my life. My Wife and I have been separated since October 27, and I  had hoped that restoration would take place, those dreams took a hit this last weekend when I was served Divorce papers. I have been very sad since receiving that news, but I have no one to blame but myself. I was a very self centered person seeking first the kingdom of "Trebby" I have been unfaithful, dishonest and a terrible example of a husband. I have had so much junk in my life as a child, that unfortunately I just never dealt with that and it has effected every other aspect of my life. The mistakes I have made are issues of character and discretion.  God,  I am so immature please grow me in your Love and Wisdom. I seek your will and your vision not mine. I for the longest time have viewed myself as failing, utterly unlovely and worthless. These things have conditioned me to put forth a front of fasle pride growing accustomed to the constant barrage from the enemy, and my own accusing thoughts. That I hardly no what is like to live without a sense of sin, failure and rejection clouding my heart.  Here is the good news! My beloved Lord does not see me this same way.  He has allowed me to lift the Vail that has covered my heart and get a glimpse of the beauty that lies within.  I have for so long could only imagine God being angry with me, who was constantly holding me in judgment. The judgment was coming from me, I have been seeking the counsel of Men of God and through the word of God and believing it. I have begun to see myself as God would see me-passionately loved and forgiven. This is the only way to feel the enjoyment that God has in me.  Trebby

      One of my girls was baptized this weekend. Man, I cried like a baby!!!!  And I  was glad I did.  She needed someone who really, genuinely cared that she decided to live for Jesus and show the world her decision meant something to her.  Now?  The hard part!!!  Living it!  Ha, ha!  She has had some major stress demons coming after her since that day.  In fact, the entire house has been a ball of tightly strung stress-lights on a tree that's lit by pure rage!!!!!  And I love working there!!!!!  Some of you may think I'm lying, but I totally know that I'm meant to be there, I'm meant to work with those girls.  And I'm meant to show them what they haven't seen anywhere else.  JESUS!!!!!  Praise reports galore!   1.  Got a car! 2.  Have an interview tomorrow with Flying J! 3.  Losing weight! 4.  The women are coming in from the rain and are ready to start talkin!  Aw, guys.  There is so much I could be complaining about.  Way too much!  But there is even more to be thankful about.  God is confirming, steadying, and strengthening me.  And this is all with me living in a glass house.  Nothing I have done or am doing is hidden.  SCARY!!!!  My mind is still a bit fuzzy from lack of sleep this weekend.  Work has come to rely on me and I love that fact.  I'm just not used to NOT sleeping!  :)  Pray for me, y'all.  If I get on at Flying J, then I will be able to relax more with the whole financial side of my life.    I'd been praying and asking God when I was going to see the physical fruits of my laborings.  He's faithful, guys.  He's faithful!  The fruit is rollin in!

      Today was amazing!!!!!  These past couple of days have been amazing!!!!  And God is AMAZING!!!!  This morning, at work, we had a horrible time with the girls and Satan was at work trying to corrupt the girls, cause trouble, and literally kill them if he could.  There was so much stress and oppression in that house...  When I took the girls to school later on, you could feel the oppression still in the air like a thick smoke!  God, there is so much there.  And the girls are searching.  They have seen in me something they desperately want for themselves.  In fact, they've asked me how I can be so calm when all of this is going on!!!  I then get to tell them how I know Someone Who loves me more than anything in this world and gives me peace beyond even my understanding!  One of the girls, an adorably stubborn creature, has honestly been trying to let God start taking over some of the horrible areas in her life.  AND SHE IS DOING IT!!!!  Praise God!!!!!  She has requested, along with a couple of the others, that I see if I can work on Wed. and Sun. nights so I can take them to church!!!  That just blesses my socks off!!!!  Another amazing thing which happened today: I got to sit down and talk to a girl I've been praying for for quite some time now.  I hadn't met her, but her parents are good friends of my family's and they had asked me to pray for her.  Well, today she was ready to talk!!!!  And boy did she!!!  She just let everything out and spilled her whole life into my lap!  Thank you, Jesus!  She let every single hurt, every injury be seen by the light and THEN, THEN she asked me for help!!!!!!!!    Before I went to meet her today, I was praying so hard.  "God, please!  Don't let this be a single word of 'Anna.'  Let this be Your words!  It's You she needs anyway, not me.  Talk through me!"  He did, guys!!!  He did!!!  I don't even remember most of what I said, but I do remember sitting outside of myself, out of my head, and watching the transformation on her face as she listened to what God had to say!!!!!!!!  Oh, guys!  That transformation was miraculous!  That's the only way to dexcribe it!  It was a miracle of God!  See, she has been diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder and DOES NOT meet new people.  She met with me today and saw GOD!!!!!!  HALLELUJAH!!!  Glory to my God!!!!!:)  I'm absolutely giddy with what happened!!!    I've promised to keep myself accountable, in good things and in bad, so I now need to speak with Pastor Eric about all this since Rob isn't here.  But, I just had to share this with you all!!!!!  What a weird God we serve!!!  Good, but dang weird!!!!  Ha, ha!

      A lot has happened since I blogged last.  A WHOLE LOT!    When I said in that last blog that I was being tested and tried with this giant fork in the road, I was right!  I had 3 different opportunities to choose the settled life.  3!!!!!  That's quite a few!  And all in one week!  I was being tempted with the life of the settled, not the life of the chosen.  Thanks to Sandy listening to God, I know that the desires of my heart will be fulfilled someday with the husband, family, and home.  But I also know, now, that that's not all!  What I chose at this testing time was the road covered in jungle roots!!!!!  And tigers laying in waiting!!!!:)  I chose the harder, unseen path.  I'm ready to be radical.  I'm ready to be a spitfire for God!!  And I'm ready to WAIT...  For my husband, family, and home.  Ok, to be totally and completely honest with everyone on here, I was tempted with three different men.  (Yes, being married is a huge temptation.)  And all three of them represented a different kind of settling.  Each man was pursuing me!!!!!!  Man, I haven't been pursued by a man...  Not ever, really.  And then I was bombarded with three men in a week!  If that isn't Satan, himself, I don't know what is!  And all three men wanted to take care of me.  They could see the huge call on my life and could also see how vulnerable I am to... to attack and pain.  I guess I have that "deer in the headlights" look!:)  But, and this is amazing, I was able to tell them, all of them, that I need more.  I need more than just protection and love.  I need a challenge!  I need the love of my life to be an inspiration to find more God!!!!!  He needs to be my spiritual leader, not just a safety net.  That's what the three men were: a safety net.    God let me be tempted.  He did!  He wanted me to see for myself what I wanted.  He also wanted me to be strong enough to choose it for myself.    Did I pass the test, God?  I think so, though not without a few more bumps and bruises.  That's ok.  The more I suffer for God, the more I realize what He suffered for me.  And I ain't seen nothing yet!!!!!!!!:)

      Ok I just wanted to share something that has been building in my heart today!  Thanks Rob for helping me see that it is ok to be where I am at! (to be content)  I have this huge ball of joy right now in my heart!  On my way to work (yes I am writing this while I am working..lol) I just prayed to God and began to thank him for everything he is doing in my life.  I told God today if I stay exactly where I am for the rest of my life I could still find Joy in everyday living.  I know in my heart that I can!!  I don't care if I am doing what it is I am doing because either way I am serving the lord.  Who cares if its by leading millions to Christ or just loving the unlovely.  I guess what I am trying to say it does not matter to me what my purpose is.  Just knowing I have one is good enough.  Right now MY purpose is to serve my Lord in whatever way he wants me to.  It is not up to me to decide if that's good enough or not.  I just want to encourage you if you are not sure what it is you are going to do.  If you are unsure what God has in store for you!  That is ok!!  Actually that's even better!  It gives you an opportunity to praise him and thank him everyday for what is about to happen.  Its an opportunity to show him my faith.  PRAISE GOD for the opportunities and what he has in store for me.  Even if I am exactly doing what I am suppose to be doing praise GOD for that too....  It just not important to me what I am doing, what is important to me is serving GOD!!  I am content with that!!

      Well, Kristie.  You know, in your head, what is truth.  But, it is in your heart that your mind is re-affirmed.  Keep letting your heart breath in that love God keeps sending down to you.  Especially now.  Satan wants you to lose all want for order in your life!  He wants that feeling of, "Why not just let everything fall since it's just going to anyway?"  Only thing is, he's a liar.  HE'S A LIAR, KRISTIE!  You are the RIGHTEOUSNESS of God through Christ Jesus.  That means you are the King's Kid.  Duh, you're going to fall.  Duh!  But, guess who's waiting to catch you, patch you up, and send you off with a big 'ole hug and kiss?  Your Father.  He loves doing that stuff.  Sure, He doesn't want you to get hurt, but He loves babying you when you do get hurt, and then nurse you back to health.    Anyway, sorry I got a little preachy.  Seems to be a running thing with me, lately.:)  I haven't written in a while.   I've been quiet.  And I think I'm waiting on something.  Something is about to happen, a decision is yet to be made, and I will know which way to turn at this fork in the road.  Ok, that sounds a little prosaic.  I'll explain.  I've been given a choice, here.  I'm at a point where there are two options: 1. A life completely safe with every comfort of home, family, love, and God, or 2. To become radical, unsure of my next step, and a spitfire for God.  My problem?  I've always wanted option 1.  In fact, when I was little, that's what I prayed for.  I wanted the husband making enough money for me to be able to explore my artistic endeavors and still be able to send my kids to private school or home school them.  I wanted the house of my dreams my husband and I would build together.  I wanted the family surrounding me and needing me.  I wanted the doting, cherishing husband whose purpose in life was to be my compliment and provider/leader.  And I wanted to have the life with God that was...  Settled.  That's all I've ever wanted, to be settled.    My family has moved several times growing up and I have never felt at "home" in any of the houses we lived in.  When I did find "home," it was in church with God wrapping around me.  And now?  He's asked me to choose for myself what I want now.  AGAIN!!!!!  I've been at this fork in the road before.  Only, I chose a husband that wasn't adoring, no home of our own, no financial stability, no family...  And that road ended abruptly.  Am I now at that SAME road?  Lord, help.  You know the desires of my heart.  And I know which choice to make.  I WANT to be settled, but I NEED to be on fire.  I need to be consumed with this, this passion for more.  I hate the song, but Stacie Orrico's "There's Gotta Be More To Life" pretty much describes it.  Someone recently asked me what makes me tick, what drives me.  They didn't believe me when I told them it's when I'm out on the streets and one of the baby girls needs to talk.  Being there for them just makes my heart jump into gear!  That's how I function, that's how my heart breaths.  And when I'm asked to choose between that and what I want out of life?  That's unfair.  God, I know what You're trying to tell me, here.  There's a reason that "Seek Ye First" has been my theme song since I can remember.  I am seeking You first!  I AM NOT choosing the settled, though I long for it.  I know You will ground me, root me.  And I know that a husband, family, home, and financial security will never do it for me.  Only You can do that.  But...  When do those other things come along?  How long, God, until I begin to see the PHYSICAL fruit from the SPIRITUAL fruit?    I sound awful whiny today.  Sorry to anyone who reads this.  I have to write this, though.  That whole transparency thing, again.  Right, Rob? (WINK, WINK!)

      Hello everyone!! It has been a while so I thought maybe it was time to let some more of what is in me out.  I don't think about writing on the blog because I personally feel I am not all that important.  I don't mean that to put myself down.  I am just saying who has the time to read my stuff and really why do YOU want to.  Then I thought hey this might be a good way to START getting to know me.  I can express more of who I am and what I am feeling by writing it instead of being put on the spot.   I went to Acquire The Fire this weekend.  I really believe the enemy was trying to make this time not very enjoyable at all.  I left Friday basically with little sleep because I worked the night before.  I am already cranky because lack of sleep put people in that equation it probably was not going to be good from the get go.  I realized something a few weeks ago.  I have been struggling with rejection issues.  I mean I KNOW in my head that nobody is making me feel unwanted or unloved.  It is completely ALL me!  So I started to go to ATF with all this and when you think you have disappointed someone you are close to you tend to feel even worse if you know what I mean.  I am not sure if this person felt disappointed or even aggravated.  However I was feeling bad because I was being sarcastic and I was getting aggravated myself.  This was all just in the first 5 hours...lol.. The Good part was there was one time on Saturday I was just sick of it.  I was sick of feeling bad, sick of feeling the way I was feeling(guilty).  So I just prayed to God and told him to take away all this junk that is on me.  It was so AWESOME how he God just instantly took away the junk and I was filled with so much joy! From then on out I was good..   It was an awesome experience and I am very blessed I got to share it with the youth. Well going back to the real me!! I said in an earlier blog God has been showing me things in my past that I have not remembered.  I am still trying to figure out how to deal with that stuff. (have not yet) The newest thing God showed me was this rejection I was feeling.  I mean I know in my head that I am loved and even appreciated.  However these feelings come in from nowhere and are like telling me that I am a fake that I am not loved.  Its crazy and I now they are all lies.  For some reason though its been happening A LOT more than usual.  I don't know why exactly. It has been a constant battle lately and I feel overwhelmed with thoughts.  Its come to the point that I have lost the desire to do things.  I have lost the desire to do homework and even to pay bills.  I use to be so on top of that stuff! Its just thoughts that why try I am going to fail anyway.  SO I was thinking maybe I am not where I am suppose to be!  Still not completely sure I am doing what I need to be doing.  Am I alone in this??  The ONLY cool thing is I have not lost my desire to know God to be in his presence.  I want to know him more I want to be around people who know him.  I want to talk about him!!  I know in my heart that this is just one of the many things I am going to have to go through in my life time.  I guess in some ways I am lost and just trying to find my way! To be honest I am sick of it!! I hate the feeling of being lost!!  I hate feelings all together.  IN my head I am where I am suppose to be....But the enemy strikes me right when he sees an opening.  I think I will stop for now I could go on forever.  Keep me in your prayers please.  God is Awesome and I know that Gods way is the better way.  That alone in itself gives me JOY!!    Kristie

      Geesh!  It's been forever!  Finally have a few minutes to blog, though not many.    So much has happened...  And I can't seem to think straight right now, so sorry, guys.  You won't be gettin the whole "Anna's Story Time!"  haha  I do want to ask you all to be prayin for me right now.  Hard stuff.  And I've had to give two weeks' notice to the Flying J.  Too much stress and not enough sleep or down time from there.  Be prayin that I get another job soon.  BILLS!!!!!  OR, you guys could pray what Rob has been sayin lately...  "Miracles happen in finances!"  Dear Lord!  Let the miracle come quick, then!  There's so much I have to do, to pay for, bills...    God, I'm under so much pressure.  Help me to STOP and rest in You.  Lord, I pray for those quiet times with You I CRAVE and need.  Since the whole "2-job" thing, I haven't been able to spend time with You like I want and I can DEFINITELY tell.  I know You are still there and still moving like You always do.  I know that miracles and breakthroughs are happening for me.  I just need time to rest, Father.    God, please.  Heal me.  You know where and how.  Just please, heal me.  And work in my specific situation so that I can be freed to work for You.  Not a stumbling block or hindrance, God, but a blessing and encouragement, a new platform.  You know what I'm talking about.  Help, God.

      Hey guys, I wanted to clear something up that might not be so clear.  The only people that can blog on this site are those who have been invited (ie, the interns and myself).  This DOES NOT mean that we are the only ones who visit this site.  We have over 100 hits on our site every day.  These hits are from people from all over the world, and from many churches within our region.  Please be very careful what you put on this blog, knowing that what you put on here will be viewed by 100's of people every week.  Please know that there hasn't been anything that I would deem "inappropriate".  There have just been some very personal issues that some people have shared, and they just thought they were sharing them with the interns who have the ability to write in the blog, and that is not true.  Continue blogging, and being real.  If your going to boast, boast in these 2 things:  1.  Knowing Jesus, and 2. Your weakness!  Just realize that others will read this!

      Hello again!! I just got back from the chapel at work.  On my break I go down there and pray!  Its really nice and quiet especially at night. I was thinking back to when I was a kid and even a teenager. I remember that I was one of those kids who were always wondering about the other kids and why they would act they way they do.  I could always go past the service and knew that there was a reason. Even if I did not understand but I knew it was there. I have always had a big heart.  I have always had a lot of love I have wanted to share but really usually loved the wrong people for the wrong reasons.  Now ever since I have been saved my love has grown so much as well.  I have been getting to the point that my chest just wants to burst.  Sometimes I have a hard time expressing that love to people and I can go to one extreme to the next.  God lead me to some scripture tonight in Romans 12 and 13.  I don't want to type out the whole thing because it would be way to long.  There are some that I would like to share.  Like Romans 12:9-13 Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil: cling to what is good.  Be devoted to one another in brotherly love.  Honor one another ABOVE yourselves. Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.  Share with God's people who are in need. Practice hospitality.  God is so awesome and I want everyone to know him.  I want to know him so more deeply than what I do. I so want to do the things he mentions because it will honor his name.  I want to be the friend, wife, mother, leader that really HONORS other people above myself.  I want all that is in the above scriptures. So for those who want to know me and know my heart.  There it is.... it just wants to love all people saved and unsaved.  I want to find the lost and show them that there is someone out there that wants to protect them and love them.  I want so much to walk in LOVE at all times. I desire to be used by God in whatever way he wants.  I have so much to learn and I know I cannot do anything without him. So know that anything I say anything I do..when I breath, when I sleep, when I talk, and when I LOVE its all him. ITS ALL GOD!! I wouldn't want it any other way.

      Hi everybody!!  The past couple of days have been awesome.  I have found my joy and really its nice.  Then again I would say I always had it but decided to start living it. Today was a testing day and actually I have a lot of testing days.  Its funny cause after church today I realized something pretty awesome!! Well let me tell you first my hubby as most of you know isn't saved.  He is an awesome man and I love him deeply.  The enemy uses him A LOT to try to steel my joy.  A lot of times it works, but today was different.  We had a disagreement about some stuff.  After I hung up the phone I started to loose my joy.  Well as I was driving back to church I was talking to my best friend..(Jesus) He was sitting in my passenger seat as he usually does.  Well I just started to tell him "Man I know my hubby does not know what he does...He does not understand the enemy is using him to try to take away my joy." In that moment I felt so sorry for him.  He is so missing out on God right now. I CHOSE not to let the enemy take my joy! (it was a good feeling to..hehe) Guys I usually have always got mad at him and his attitude.  To be honest though I have a little relief to know that its not all him.  He don't understand what is going on not completely.  I can't wait for that day that he invites Jesus into his heart.   Thank you Jesus for that day!!  Every trial you face is an opportunity to let him work in your life for abundance. If you invite him into your circumstances he will keep his promise to work everything together for your good Romans 8:28  Now on a completely different note..haha I am so thankful for the youth ministry and the people God has placed in my life.  I really love all the adults that help out.  They are really awesome! Each one of them have something that I can respect and enjoy very much.  I am so excited to see what God has in store for us.  I am even more excited when I think about doing ministry with these people.  We are all human and make mistakes.  There are times that we are going to have a bad day. I just love knowing I can consider them family.  Its a process that I am willing to be patient about because I know the end result. God thank you so much for the many blessings I receive each day! I just want to pray special blessings over Chris, Jessica, Jon, Exie, Nathan, Sandi, Tony, Cliff, and anyone else that I might have forgot to mention. YOU GUYS ROCK!!

      Good Morning,  I just felt the need to vent. This is one of those times, when, I'm just down in the dumps and feeling sorry for myself. "I know get over it" I agree, but with that being said, I'm still human and feel the ups and downs of life. I just dread what faces me with my impending divorce and all that junk that goes with it. You tell yourself that this can be relatively painless, but what a bunch of crap that is people are making life changing decisions, and rethinking their future plans. I had no intention of ever being divorced for a second time in my life, but that is exactly where I'm at. I shoulder a huge part of that responsibility, and will have to live with that. I always viewed people that have had multiple divorces as real losers, and vowed that "I" would never be divorced for a second time, spoke to soon. This is what the Holy Spirit has been revealing to me over the last Six months.   I could not have loved anyone intimately, and had any relationship that would last beyond the physical attraction that has been my problem since I was 13 years old. I have had a dozens of relationships that were nothing more than physical or at best just superficial, on the surface things. Now my wife Cindy, did her best to make me go deeper than surface stuff, but I couldn't on my own. Like Rob said the other night at house church, I never had an example of love. Anyway, Jesus has revealed that I must first Love him,and seek after him passionately in this experience love will be revealed through scripture, truth, and a deeper relationship with Jesus. Jesus is my Lover, and maybe someday, I can love a woman the way she deserves to be loved. "you know like Jesus loves"  I first must discover my Jesus, and who knows he may be my lover in every sense of the word. Jesus is love right?  PS:  Sarah,  You are in my prayers.   Trebby

      Do you just have those days when you are feeling sorry for yourself.  When you see Awesome things happening to other people and you are happy for them but you wonder why its not happening for you.  Maybe you just haven't been patient enough or maybe its not Gods will..   I am so sick of it!  I am so sick of the enemy trying to beat me down. I have been really sick the past couple of days(physically).  I am not one that gets sick too often.  I might get a headache or something but I am not usually so sick that it hurts to move.  Being sick yesterday was one of the worse days of my life.  My son who has no fear found a way to get out of our yard.  We have a lock on it thinking that would stop him.  But together him and the dog manage to find a way out.  There was only a 3 to 5 minute time span from when he went outside to when I decided to check on him.  HE was GONE!! Ok... You know I was looking sick anyway not wanting to move.  I got my sweatshirt on and went outside looking for him.  Lets just say a half an hour later I found him.  I was good until I got him into the house.  I LOST IT!  I was crying uncontrollable because I thought he could not get out of the yard and believed someone took him.  I was crying and I couldn't control it all the sadness just was being pushed out of me.  I really don't know how people who have missing kids go through it without wanting to die.  For those few minutes I was hurting so bad I wanted to die.  Even though I had found him and he was right beside me.  Well later that day I had to take him to the walk in clinic because he had poison oak all over his face and it was swollen by his eyes.  So he needed a shot and some medicine.  So I decided to go to work anyway which I am not sure why cause I came home an hour after I got there cause I was feeling bad again.  Well if that was not bad enough I was feeling down anyway I got calls from friends etc.. On how great they are doing.  Lets be honest I love them and I am truly happy they are doing great, but today was not the day I wanted to hear about it.  I did hear about it though and told them I was happy and tried really hard to not tell them about poor old me.  I guess the whole point of me getting on here and telling you guys this stuff is that there are going to be days that suck!!  There is no getting around them! However I realized something when I had that terrible feeling that I lost my son or that someone took him.  I realized that is how GOD feels about every single one of us.  That is how he feels when the enemy is trying to steel our soul and joy.  Heck I am the first one to tell you that with yesterday, today I was loosing joy because of my circumstances that my life is in.  Trying to figure out what I am going to do about that and this.  In the End I just let the enemy take yesterday away from me!  The day is over and gone!!  He is NOT going to get today!!  If the enemy somehow wiggled his way in and Got a day from you.  Let it go and move on.  Don't let him get another one!  God Please forgive me for feeling sorry for myself and being selfish. I know what you have in store for me is better than what I can even imagine. I know you want to give me the desires of my heart!  It says Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart. Psalm 37:4...  I am ready to continue to delight myself in you! No Worries! In Jesus Name...Amen

      Hello,  Anna, it was good to hear about your mom, and how important she is to you. I have such a weird life can any of you relate? I am Forty years old, and feel as if a my life is just beginning in a lot of ways. I am preparing to move into a home with a bunch of people, that I have never even camped out with. I have lived on my own, since I was Nineteen so this is a huge step for me. Then at the same time, I am preparing for a divorce and moving out of a home that is so large you could get lost. I have a giddy excitement about this whole adventure, and I know it is a God thing. He has placed me in this position with these people for a purpose, and I want to be obedient to my Father. I look at all this stuff as a season in my life, but not the people, who I have come to know over the last year. We will be friends for life. In the midst of these incredible personal trials, God, is opening doors and bringing forth the truth about who I am in him. I am weak and struggle daily and that is a good thing for God's power is made perfect in my weakness.   I look forward to the experiences that await me in the future. I look forward to entering into a deeper more intimate relationship with God over the next year. I am sure all of us will be forever changed by the new wonderful experience that is awaiting all of us in the "Big Blue House".  Love ya,  Trebby

      I HAD to get on here and write about my awesome Momma and how much she's meant and done for me.  You know, there is a country song where one of the lyrics says that her momma is her biggest fan...  Well, that totally applies.    When I made the decision to go to St. Louis and see what God would do there, Momma was scared to death her little girl would never come back.  (Thank God I did!!!  She'd have killed me!!!lol)  Not only did she take me out to St. Louis herself, but she also was my biggest financial supporter.  Out of her own check, she gave me $100 a month!!!!  Man!!!  She believes in me so much, she gave up what would have been saving and spending money and invested it into her not-so-reliable daughter.  Know why?  Momma knows what God told her.    Before I was born, He told her that I was meant for Him, to do a work for Him that Momma hadn't been able to do....     Mom told me during one of my home breaks this: she was proud to be able to help me because I was doing what she couldn't.  I still cry at that thought.  Momma was called into ministry but wasn't able to do that in the way she THOUGHT after she was married and had children.  Her ministry?  Momma may not realize this, was to prepare me for the next step in His extremely confusing and awesome plan.  And she did a heck of a job, if I do say so myself.  Momma is still my biggest supporter today, and my best friend.  Mom keeps reminding me of Africa, of my perfect husband, and the girls I am and will be helping.  And she does this without any words.  She does this with her hugs and smooches, playing with my hair when I put my head in her lap, and in the shrieks of rebuke!!!!!lol  I love my mom.  And not just for what she's been for me, but what she hasn't been.  She hasn't been a doubter.  EVER!!!!!  Thanks, Momma.

      I know what you mean, Trebby, about the "Mask."  I don't know how many sucky poems I've written about masks.  Especially as a teenager, I discovered that the mask was masking me.  I was covered, hidden, and couldn't find out how to take it off and live as ME, as Anna.    When we are all young, or young in Christ, we put on this shell, this protective covering we invent for ourselves.  We think this is who we want to be and this is who we SHOULD be.  This is what the world wants.  And this is how I'll make it, how I'll keep safe.  DECEPTION!!!!!!!  I see now what that mask really is.  It is a mud bath!!!!  Explanation of MUD BATH:  A mud bath is just what it sounds like.  It's mud.  It's used to protect us from the harsh environment of the world.  For instance, elephants jump right into the mud and revel in the ewy-gooyness of the mud to protect them from the brutal sun and the annoying bugs.  Well, God gave them the protection they needed already!  Their thick covering of skin.  Have you ever seen an elephant's skin?  That thing is TOUGH!!!  And thick.  Yet, they are luxuriating in the mud as an added protection.  Problem?  The mud is filled with the very dung of the elephants as well as other animals.  They are wallering, as Momma says, in their own crap.  And they do that to protect themselves!!!!  Anyone see my point, here?  We waller around in our own dung to protect ourselves.  We cover what is us with the dung of us and the dung of the world as an additional shield.  What we don't get?  The dung, the mud keeps us from developing our skin like it should be.  The sun is supposed to burn it, the bugs are supposed to annoy it.  We are not supposed to LIKE what this world is doing to us!  And we don't need another shield to protect us.  We have One already: GOD!!!  He is our shield, our strength, our protection.  If we're rolling around in our own crap, He gets deprived of His job, His asked-for duty: to protect His children.    If you all don't get burned or annoyed by the world, your skin will never get used to what it feels like.  With the mud on there, you will be indifferent to the reality of this EVIL world and what it wants to do to us.  The mud gets into even our eyes until we don't know where we are going, which could be we're going straight to our death.  Oooo!!!  Parables!  Like em lots!  Don't think I'm preachin, y'all, unless you remember I'm preachin to myself, here!  I still grab my dung and slop it on sometimes.  I've been known to make an entire self-pity manure bath for myself and stay there for days.  Good thing is, I know what I'm bathing in and CAN'T STAND the conviction that comes when I waller again.  Be encouraged.  Know that God is the best manure shoveler and remover I know!!!  HAhaha!!!!  God is cool!!!

      Greetings,  It is really cool to read all about what God is doing in all your lives. It is good to know such awesome people. I have been working on this thing called fear...I have let this thing guide my destiny for way to long. Christ tells us not to fear, we are free to be vulnerable. Being vulnerable means being REAL. This has long been my problem, you see, I did not want to risk rejection by laying  my life out before others, and saying this is what I am and what I am not. I have so desperately wanted to be accepted by others, so I created this facade that mask the real me and then found myself hidden behind a barrier of secrecy and hypocrisy, leading to constant compromise. Here is where God has been working, he has told me that being accepted by him is more important than being accepted by others. If my faith is in God, I don't need to fear being REAL. The stronger my faith is in God, the more I am driven to be REAL. I have struggled with the fact that God has accepted me, but I know now he has and I can face the rejection by others. I can now admit my struggles, my failures, my sins, and my emotional weaknesses...I don't have to pretend, that I am always on top of the world. It is OK to swallow that ugly thing called Pride and just be REAL.  Dear Heavenly Father,  I am a broken piece of pottery put the me back together using your own special Love. I am a sinner, who struggles with many things. I know that your Love reaches all the universe and covers all, but please let me have a personal relationship with you this very day.  Treb

      Rob and Treb, thankfully, sat down with me the other night to kinda counsel me through some of my crap.  While they were advising/patienly listening to me, some new ideas popped into my head.  Well, they aren't "new" as far as revelations the world has had, but new as far as "new to me".  And even though I knew these things in my head, my heart's been ignoring what it could not deal with.  (For a while now.)  I've been in a working mentality for too long.  And I've purposely MADE myself be busy.  You don't have to think when your mind is busy with details.  True, the work is worthwhile and for God, but it hasn't left me any time for what Rob calls 'gazing.'  Ugh!  I hate gushy words like that.  I'm so not a froo-froo girl.:)  BUT!!!!!  I haven't simply STOPPED and listened for a long time.    I'm afraid of what I'll hear when I do stop, finally, to listen.  I'm sure I'll hear the voice of a disappointed Father.  He has to be disappointed.  I AM!!!  So, how much more is my Father, Who has SO MUCH MORE for me than I can see or imagine?    WHY do I get back into this cycle?  WHY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!    I settle.  For very little.  And not enough.    There's more than I've seen.  THERE'S GOT TO BE!!!!!  Otherwise, what in the heck am I living for?  WHAT??!?!?!?!?!?!?!  The things God's shown me He wants for me...  Way too lofty for my puny, miserable self to accomplish.  And I have to convince my not-so-open mind to accept that fact.    I haven't been living a life as a child of God.  I've been living it as only the SERVANT of God.  If I'm serving, somehow I'll redeem myself for all the screw-ups I've made recently.  That's how I work.  I WORK things off.  I don't accept them as forgiven and forgotten.  Y'all are thinkin, "She still hasn't gotten this!!!"  I know.  My head knows.  AND I SURE AS HECK know how to preach it to others.    What's going to happen in the girls' home when I have to LIVE this principle out?  For them all to see?  They have to learn it from someone who LIVES this, not just preaches it.  God, please.  Don't allow me to be a person whose witness is of words only and not as a lifestyle.  I hated those people.  In fact, I despised them!  DWYSYWD...  Do what you said you would do...    I am forgiven.  And the sin has been forgotten.    There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.    Know something?  ALL of the interns in St. Louis would randomly quote that to me throughout the day.  Funny, huh?  I've lived a life in the shadow of condemnation and guilt.  That has defined me!  God, what's it going to take to allow me to live a life of PEACE?  And victory?  When am I going to be able to wake up in the morning and feel GOOD about who You made me to be?  When will I realize I am Your daughter?  And Your CHOSEN bride......  Lord, help.  Heal me.  In all the ways You know I need.  You know me.  And You still love me...  Why?  I'm not looking for answers.  I already have them.  I just wanted to write all these things out so that they cannot torment me anymore.  GET IT OUT!  In the name of Jesus Christ, thoughts of condemnation, abandonment, and rejection are NO LONGER allowed to plague me!!!!!  And I WILL see You, Jesus.  I will.  I have to!!!  I need You so desperately!!!!!!!!!!!

      Hey all,  Man I am reading something that to me seems like hits the spot!! This is what I want to teach people!! I believe there is a principle here that you and I can apply to any difficult situation.  Holding onto joy starts with a decision to believe the best.  Then we need to line up our mind and mouth with Gods word.  This keeps an open channel for the oil of Gods joy to flow.  No matter how bad your cirumstances look, God LOVES you.  Never let go of that truth.  keep it in your mind and keep it in your mouth.  If you're in the midst of a situation that's stealing your joy, begin praying.  GOD I don't like this, but for some reason I need this experience to fulfill your destiny in my life.  I believe it will work out for the good, even though it does not feel good right now.  I cast my cares upon you, and I ask you to carry me through this situation.  In Jesus name amen!! As believers, we are more than conquerors because we have Jesus walking with us through our problems.  Our worst day with Jesus will always be better than our best day without him!!

      Hello,  The Lord put the word perseverance in my heart and then compelled me to blog about it. I think that James, described it better than anyone ever. We live in a world today that is so easy to just throw in the towel, when things aren't going the way we think they should be going. It can be home, work, school, Marriage, Ministry, etc. If the apostle Paul would have had this attitude where would Christianity be today? If the Disciples would have had this attitude how would they have spread the gospel and been such worthy ambassadors to boldly proclaim Jesus as Lord an Savior? The one common denominator that set these men apart from all others was their, I can do attitude. Unlike most of us today, who immediately succumb to the pressure. Let's face it, we have struggles everyday and temptations that can impact our lives in a positive or negative manner. Our character is formed from these times of great peril. God has promised that when we persevere the reward is great. I want to encourage and challenge all who read this to stand tall and press on through, when faced with the decision to flee or face it. I am uniquely qualified to write on this subject, because for most of my life I choose to flee, but NO more. I stand tall and choose to go head first into the abyss. The darkness does not scare me anymore for I posses the light of Christ.  Trebby

      I want you to know that if pride is a sin, then I am one of the biggest sinners around, becuase I am so proud of the team that we have!!!!  Our team is the most dedicated, sacrificial, and committed group around.  I have been so blessed to see the radical growth in all of you.  The places that you will let God go in your hearts encourage me to keep pressin' hard after Jesus.  Each and everyone of you are so special in many different ways.  I am honored to serve along side of you, and I want you all to know that I would die for you!  Thank you so much for submitting to imperfect authority, I am empowered by your love and devotion to the Dream Center.  Thank you all for making it such a joy to be in ministry.  I appreciate each one of you, and I love you all very desperately!  Continue to "BE" the example, the true representation of Christ on the earth!  Much Love, PR

      I've asked Rob to hold me accountable.  (PRAY FOR ME!)  And I sincerely hope he does.    Am I crazy, you ask?  Yep.  But I also want to be able to dream again and see visions from God.  I'd lost my heart, as some of you may have heard on Sunday.  And I didn't know why I wasn't hearing anything new from God.  DUH!!!!  How in the world could He encourage my heart and move my heart if it wasn't even there?!?!?!  Doesn't make a whole lot of sense, does it?  How am I supposed to change that?  Well, going to L.A. DEFINITELY helped.  I cried for the lost, the hopeless.  I haven't cried for them in I don't know how long.    When I came back from St. Louis, I was ready to save the world and start a girls' home.  In that order!  When none of the above happened, I lost sight of what God wanted me to see.  He needed me to slow down and listen for a while.  At the SLDC, I was moving and working CONSTANTLY!  Sure, I grew leaps and bounds, but I couldn't hardly stand to sit still and wait on God.  So, this was my waiting time.    Stupid me, I misconstrued waiting as God just abandoning me.  God was only wanting me to chase after Him, to pursue Him.  He'd done the initial work by waking up my heart to the dream of speaking His Words to the hopeless.  Now, He wanted to spend some intimate time with Him.  Boy, did I ever handle that wrong!  I've gotten into so much trouble lately.  Not like you think.  I haven't robbed any convenience stores or shot up any coke.  Nothing like that.  But I have let my mind wander back to things it CERTAINLY did not need to revisit.    I let my mind think about the mystery behind the dark side rather than the mystery behind the light.  Man, I can be dumb!  I've already figured out the dark side!  It's gonna end in fire and damnation!  (Can I say that on here?  Guess I did.)  The light?  That's something altogether separate.    The last time I had an actual vision of God or of His plan...  Too long ago.  And when I had that vision, it mystified me!  I wanted to know more and more about what I saw!!!!!    God, more!!!!  I'm greedy, now, for more knowledge about You!  You've heard my prayers asking for dreams and visions to return.  I know I was named "Anna" for a reason.  Anna was not only the GRANDMOTHER of Jesus, but she was also a prophetess.  You've given me words before, bring it on!  If that's what You want, God, then please do it!  Just please start talking to me again.  I need to hear more from You.  Without Your Word, I've fallen and nearly killed myself in the process!

      Today was so awesome.  When we first started blitzing to get the kids to come over, Brooke, who I met two weeks ago and have seen twice now, ran up and threw herself at me.  She almost knocked me over.   I have no idea how many kids were there after we got started.  At first there were like 15 kids, but they just kept coming.  I'll have to get an exact count from Cassie before I overexaggerate in print.  It was so awesome, though.  The girls side of the tarp was full and the guys side was over half full.  And I couldn't believe how many adults were there from the neighborhood.  I can't wait until we have enough people doing adopt-a-block to expand into other neighborhoods like stonegate and Belmont.  There are so many areas in our communtiy that need to experience Christ's love instead of just hearing about it.  The church has been preaching Jesus instead of being Jesus to these people for too many years.  Quit asking what would Jesus do and just do it.

      Hello,  I am still feeling the after shocks from our California trip.(No Pun intended)  I gave my testimony on Sunday and that was my frivolous attempt at describing what the trip meant to me and how it impacted my life. I have yet to find the words that could accurately describe how I feel or the impact it made on me. I hope, that I will never be able to accurately describe my trip. If words could reflect what is in my heart than by all means let them flow like a river. I do not desire an emotional experience alone, those come and go with the changing of seasons. How do I know it has been permanently etched into my very soul? Because, all I can say about the trip is that it was awesome.    Trebby

      Man, this week at the Pastor's School in Los Angeles was incredible.  Today we gave testimonies and it was hard to even try to find words to describe adequately what is going on in my heart.  I think everyone who went feels that way too.  There is such a seriousness in my heart about what we are doing.  This is for real.  I have never been so passionate about anything.  I know this is easier for me than some of the other interns becuase Metro Kids is already up and running, and many of their dream ministries are still in the very earlies stages of being developed.  Tommy Barnett said while we were there that you can tell a vision is from God when you can let it go but it won't let go of you.  Anna, you will see it come to pass!!    At the very beginning of the conference, they did what they call the Parade of Ministries, which is where all of the DC ministries walk across the stage holding signs for their ministry.  This procession took an hour, just to walk across the stage; it was incredible.  Then was the parade of miracles where several of the ministries came back up with people in their programs giving their testimonies.  A phrase several of them said in giving their testimony was "cancelled out."  Their parents, freinds, siblings, etc. had cancelled out on them.  Some of them cancelled out by comitting suicide, others by just leaving, and others by being physically there, but not really there.  Praise God, we will not cancel out on these people.  We won't give up on them, and we won't give up on ourselves.  The success of the dream center in LA comes through consitancy and relationships.  It has nothing to do with the programs or pastors, but the individuals who go to the neighborhood and knock on the doors, hold the kids, encourage those who are down, etc.  We must dream big and never cancel out.  There are so many divine appointments out there, people we need to encounter.  We must walk with open eyes.  So often we just don't see the need.  Trebby has said that he hasn't felt a specific calling, he just wants to meet needs, but that is the call.  To see a need and fill it.    I can't wait to see all the doors that God is going to open up and all the people's lives that are going to be impacted by the staff and interns of the Dream Center and the volunteers from different churches in the community.  There were so many great realtionships and connections started while we were in LA, and I know God is going to continue networking his people to accomplish his plans.

      Man!  This week was incredible.  We went to the L.A. Dream Center and got our butts seriously kicked on some topics.  And, yes, I did too.  What's the deal now?  The passion that I gained from L.A. is ready to bust out of this pathetic shell commonly known as "Anna" and wants to rock this city.  You're all thinkin', 'Well, isn't that why she went?'  Yeah, I did go for that.  What's killin' me is this: I can't do everything yet!!!!   It's the waiting game now, waiting for God's perfect timing and all that...  Ugh!  And there's more to this story than I've told.  Before we even got on the plane, the attack started.  True, I was tired already and the enemy loves to jump right in when I have the least resistance.  Guys, this is some tough junk!  I'm insufficient.  I'm inadequate.  I'm weak.  I'm unstable.  And I just don't have what it takes.  Anything else I'm missing?  I know, I know.  Being so wrong for this job is exactly what makes me RIGHT!  Because it's going to be ONLY God and not a darn thing of Anna.  Man, though, I'd like to have some reassurance on this one.    My personal life is in such shambles right now, I don't feel like I DESERVE to be doing anything for my Father.  I'm not anywhere close to where He's gonna need me to be for this task.    I'm not ready, God.  And I don't know how to get ready.    Please, Father, take my ineffectiveness and over-ride it somehow.  Anyway You can, please!  Just do it.  I'm so stinkin' tired and not much good right now.  So, it's literally going to have to be COMPLETELY You and not a thing of me.  And that's scary.

      Wow I just wrote a blog but somehow it messed up so I lost everything. I hope this time it works..lol 1 Corth 2:16 For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?  But WE have the mind of Christ. Hmmmm I have the mind of Christ :) I would like to think so, and I am actually starting to believe it!  Confidence in who I am in Christ.  WOW that's a hard one for me.  I believe I can hear from God!  I believe all wisdom comes from my spirit which is from God. But I have been believing this lie from the enemy for so long that the person I want to be is not me.  Even though I know God loves me and I know Jesus died for me.  It still is not me!!  I knew people liked me and thought I was cool, however I thought if they really knew me then they would not like me!  Another lie!!  But God really knows me and loves me for me and that is good enough for him.  So why can't I take that and stand with confidence in who he made me to be.  Well guess what I am starting to!!  WOOOHOOO!!  I decided not to believe that stupid lie that the enemy wants me to believe.  I believe that I am an awesome person who loves God and seeks his face every chance I get!  I am a person who walks in love!  I am a person who helps others, encourages them and builds them up.  I am living my life to Glorify him and to share the word with anyone willing to receive it.  I am one of his favorites and with him I can do anything, without him I am nothing.  So everything that I am God I give you thanks.  Thanks so much because without your love and grace I would not have a reason to live.  Thank you JESUS!! I don't know if most of you know but I work at Methodist hospital.  I work 2-12hour shifts a week. (7p to 7am) Well with the drive it turns into 16 hour days.  Then I am trying to catch up on sleep the next day or so.  Needless to say sleep is something I lack.  ANYhoo I decided to ask my boss if I could maybe work three days a week 8 hour days.. So I only would have to work 7p to 3:30am.  Which for me would be awesome!  I would get home in enough time for my hubby to go to work and we would not need a babysitter.  PRAISE GOD she agreed!  It saves me money on babysitting which I need all the money I can get..lol.. I believe it will help me out not to be SOOO tired!  So I just wanted to share some of my good news with my family.  Without your love and kindness I would not have ever been able to experience God!  Its people like you that helps make it worth wild!  Let me rephrase that its people like us!!

      Man, so many things are running n my head.  I though I would just put a few of them on here, free up some space in my head.  Man, I am falling hard and fast for these kids.  I don't think I have ever been so committed, so passionate about anything in my life.  something inside me desperately wants to take the older kids, the 10, 11, 12 year olds and erase all their hurt, make them forget everything bad that has happened, fill up thier voids with God's love, teach them to dream again; and take the little ones, keep them innocent, sheild their eyes, cover their ears, impart Jesus love in such a way they will never leave it, and teach them to walk in his plan.  I want to tell them they are worth more than any one has ever given them credit for, that however big their dreams are, their potential is even greater than those dreams.  The potential contained within one child is beyond what we could imagine.  Those we think of as great people were all once children with dreams:  Billy Graham, David Wilkerson, Mother Teresa, etc.  They were all kids, and someone took the time to believe in them.  The other day Pastor Eric was talking about the difference between volunteers and called ones.  He said something to the effect of volunteers will give their time to do what needs to be done, but called ones will give their lives.  Called ones are committed to give whatever it takes.  That is why I have been saying I feel like I am doing what I was created to do.  Before when I have done other ministries, I have been a volunteer, serving, giving my time and energy, because it was needed, and I wanted to serve.  But I have never given my life to something like this before.  Never before have I understood just how empty money and possessions are.  Not that there is anything wrong with having money, but it doesn't do anything for me.  If I just had a bed to sleep in and food to eat, and time and transportation to do Metro Kids and spend time mentoring these kids and loving them, that would be enough for me.  I'm not just a volunteer anymore!!!  For those who are volunteers, there is still nothing wrong with that, becuase it is necessary, and God calls us to be servants, but it is amazing to begin to walk out my calling, and i know there is so  much more to come.  I praise God for leaders like Robert who will lay down their life to see others begin to walk in their destiny.  I know it has to be hard when you are a man of excellence to release others to do the ministry.  Thank you PapaRob.  It's cool cuz Rob didn't just leave me hanging, but started out doing a lot with Metro Kids, and is slowly backing out as I am more comfortable with doing it.  It's like going to kindergarden.  The first day, he carried me all the way to the classroom and held me for a while, then the next day he let go at the door to the room, and soon he will just pull the car up to the curb and wave as I get out.  That is enough for tonight, I guess.  I need some sleep.  (This has been another episode of Ramblings of a Tired Sarah)

      I told you guys that new dreams were being birthed in me.  And the old dreams are being redefined.  Guess it's time to dream with y'all!  Lately, I've been in this sleeping mode.  God's been allowing me to rest and recuperate from the MAJOR spiritual battles I've gone through in these past 4 years.  (MAN!  I just realized it's been 4 years of constant battle!  I hadn't really thought about how long I've been going through all this!)  And now, He's calling me to wake up.    When I got home from St. Louis, I was still on this mega high of wanting to use what I'd learned and get out on the streets to save the world, one girl at a time!  And then Mom got sick.  And Jason came back.  And I started ANOTHER internship program.  And I had no money OR car...  I became overwhelmed and lost the zeal I'd come home with.  I got busy again, losing myself in the duties of being a servant  only  and not a daughter of God.  I thought throwing myself into the work of being a servant would peove to everyone where I was at spiritually.  This was a BIG problem for me with Rob.  Coming into the New Castle Dream Center, I was admittedly cocky and assumed I knew what I was doing.  WRONG!!!!!  I'd learned integrity in my work ethic, but I didn't learn how to rest and just shine.  I didn't and DON'T need to prove myself through works anymore.  People see that I will work to the best of my ability in whatever is put before me.  Now, people need to see me glow for Jesus.   One of my spiritual mothers from my old church saw me a couple of months ago and noticed I'd gotten quiet.  Well, she described it as not lighting up like the 600 watt light bulb she remembered.  Ouch!!!!!!!!!  I thought, 'I've only just gotten back from St. Louis!!!  I should be glowin in the stinkin dark!  I've earned it, haven't I?'  (Paradigms keep shifting, thank God.)  Wow.  Talk about needing to re-evaluate where I was at!  (Will the evaluation process ever end?)  Where exactly did I lose that glow?  And why?  Well, I got busy, and that's when I noticed the definite change.  Not only was I busy, but I was worried.  Do daughters get worried about what their daddy is making and if there will be food on the table?  NO!!!!  I don't think so.  So, why was I worrying about all the unnecessaries in my life?  Sure, I thought the situations needed to be resolved and IMMEDIATELY!  But I forgot...  IT'S NOT ABOUT ME!!!!!!  OR MY TIMING!!!!  You are asking, 'what does this have to do with dreams?'  I'll tell you.  After I realized I wasn't glowing, I asked God what it would take to get that glow back again.  What does He then do?  He takes out everything that's in me, (rather painful process) and slowly begins to put back in me only those things He wants.  Yes, I will be a firebrand for God again, but the fire I had had too much of "Anna-Spirit" and not the Holy Spirit.  Yes, I will be a prayer warrior, but He wanted to make sure I could even concentrate on ONLY those things He wanted me to pray about and not make my prayer time into a worry session.    My friend Christy (you don't know her) had a vision God gave her about me.  She said that she saw me and then I turned into a glass half-full with water.  She then saw the hand of God pour me completely out and throw me, the whole cup, into a huge bucket overflowing with water.  That's exactly what He's doing now!!!!!  (It's cool to see the things He's shown me and other saints coming to fruition.)    And just how is this redefining my old dreams and giving me new dreams?  What I'd thought of as FOR SURE things which God gave me and ended up twisting to my own understanding were taken completely away from me so God could give them back to me in the pure form He intended.  Woohooo!!!!  Painful process, but AWESOME!  And now!!!!  He's giving me new dreams and old dreams with a new twist.    This is cool, guys!  The girls' home?  I don't know just yet.  God is still taking the "Anna" out of it and hasn't given it back just yet.  But I'll let you know as soon as I find out more details!

      Finally, some victory I can see and feel!!!!!  Praise God!  Sunday night, my friend from 1st Assembly asked me to come to church with her and visit afterwards.  Well...  I was admittedly nervous about going back since I'd not BEEN back since I broke off things with Jason.  Yes, I did go to my youth pastor and explain what all was going on, but I decided it was best not to go back to any services.  On top of that, I had to almost completely cut off any contact with the youth just in case any of them wanted to come with me wherever I went and didn't stay planted.  I went, though, and Sarah went along with me.  She'd gone to 1st a long time ago and wanted to see how everyone was doing.  THANK GOD SHE DID!!!!  My friend couldn't make it because of a family emergency and that left me in a bit of an awkward position.  We were LATE on top of that!  (Funny.  God has seriously been teaching me some humility lately.  Side note: locked my keys in my car once and Rob did it a second time...  IN THE SAME NIGHT!  More humility.)  EVERYONE stared, but smiled.      Ah....  Better than I could even have hoped for!!!!  And the best part?  I wasn't even bothered by the fact that Jason sat right in front of me, flirted with me later on, and was just plain THERE at the service!!!  I WAS JUST FINE!!!!    God, You've done some amazing things in my life.  But this freedom?  Whoa.  This is cool.  I'm not BOUND anymore.  I don't even feel nervous around him.  And that's thanks to You.    Thanks, God.  I love You!

      What a night.  I am really tired so I am going to try to make this a short entry (everyone who knows me very well is lauging out loud at that right now).  Tonight I had a flat tire on Sulpher Springs road, out in the country near the church.  So of course I called PapaRob to be my knight in shining armor (if girls were meant to change tires, God wouldn't have invented cell phones).  So I got the spare tire out and waited for Rob to come rescue me.    Then the guy whose yard I was parked in saw me sitting out there and came to help me.  We didn't make very much conversation, just names, thanks, etc.  Turns out he was one of Rob's friends (like, who isn't).  Anyway, the guy was a Christian, too.  So Rob was like, hey did you tell him anything about Jesus.  And I was like, no.  So he finished changing the tire, and Rob said, "tell him your testimony."  So I got embarassed, but started talking.  After a few mins, Rob said, "Tell him what God did in your life while you were in Texas."  So I started talking about it.  Then, when I got back in the car, I started thinking about it.  What exactly had happened in Texas.  As I began to look at everything that has happened in the last three years to get me to this point, I am just amazed at how God gets his plans to work, one step at a time.  When I left for college, I planned on getting 3 things:  a husband, a degree, and the training I needed to be a missionary.  What I got was an ex-fiance, a lot of lifelessons, and the training I needed to be me.  I never wanted to do childrens ministry, or street ministry.  I qualified for work study, and my chices were work at a Boys and Girls Club or do paperwork for a professor.  So i jumped on the Boys and Girls Club job.  I was timid at first, and the workers there didn't think I would be any good at it.  But after a week or two, I started loosening up, and I found out I was actually good at it.  I could take a group of over 100 kids between the ages of 6 and 13 and get them to listen to me.  Most of our kids came from high risk nieghborhoods and broken homes, and I fell in love with them.  I loved my job, putting in twice as many hours as they could pay me for the first year, then taking a position with them as Director of Educational Programming.  I eventually just knew it was time to move on, and I was heart-broken.  I loved those kids.  They loved me.  We had a bond deeper than any of the other staff.  I cried harder over having to quit that job than almost anything else.    But I still didn't see any future in children's ministry.  I had decided to do urban ministry instead of cross-cultural, but never knew that it would have anything to do with kids.  Then, I was supposed to go to Israel over spring break, just over a year ago.  They cancelled the trip do to the instability and violence.  So I decided to go to the Los Angeles Dream Center instead.  I began to read about it, and it was like passion just rose up in me.  I was so excited about the trip.  When I was there, what impressed me the most, was that the interns and staff there give their entire lives to ministry.  It isn't on of the many roles they play; it's who they are, and it's who I wanted to be.  I still didn't think about doing kids ministry, but wanted to do a Dream Center.    When I came home at Christmas, I was talking to Rob about this, and I had been praying about moving back to Indiana.  When Rob was talking to me about the internship, and developing your dream ministry, I blurted out that Metro Kidz was what I would want to do.  I haven't told Rob this, but I didn't realize that was my dream ministry until the moment I said it, and it just hit me.  Then Rob was like, I have the trailor, I just need someone to run the ministry, and on the outside I was like wow and on the inside I was like holy cow.  But I knew then that it was God.  Now, I've told several people this before, but I feel like I am doing what I was created to do.  It is the most incredible feeling in the world.  It is amazing how God used all the little things in texas, the things that I just thought were details, to paint the bigger picture.  I can't wait to see what is in store next.  I have been doing a lot of dreaming and praying lately.  More about that later--gotta tell PapaRob the details before I tell the rest of the world.

      Yep....  Thought I'd hear back from you, Rob.  Actually, I wondered why you didn't yesterday when I dropped of the moolah for the LA trip.  Thanks.  Needed it.  Be encouraged, y'all.  This seems like I keep on the same cycle of obsessing, getting over it, obsessing, getting over it...  And in a way, it was the same cycle.  Only this time, I've asked the right questions and got some real answers...  And I'm living out the results.    Before this, I would never have submitted my thoughts about my personal relationships with ANYONE, let alone hundreds of people on the N.C. Dream Center Blog Site!!!!!:)  And definitely not ROB WHITE!!!  (I'm growin up, Rob.)  The cycle is broken and will not be something I struggle with so much anymore.  Yes, my own evil desires drug me away and enticed me.  BUT, and I lke this "BUT", I AM THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST!  And I am victorious.  Kristie has been talking with me and counseling me about this.  To tell the truth, I ASKED her to counsel me on this topic.  She's a woman who hears from God and I've submitted my total and complete thoughts to her.  I'M EXPOSING!  God is walking me through this, praise Him!  He's taking His time because He's seen what I've done in the past with all the stupid relational mistakes I've made.  Now, He's given me a gift.  AND He's given me the grace to be able to wait........  Patiently.  Last night, Kristie and I went walking and I told her how I wanted that peace back which I'd lost by obsessing over the situation.  THEN, I talked with my friend Craig from AL and he prayed with me about it over the phone...  (I've been doing a lot of talking)  I can truthfully tell you I have peace.    I love Ecclesiastes 3.  Well, I love the whole book of Ecc.  (Been studying it lately.)  There is a time when all these things will come to pass.  God's Word does not return void.  He's told me secrets and whispered instructions.  I've only to wait for His timing.   I know, Rob.  Wait.  And I will, joyfully not thinking about it.  Honest.  In the meantime, there are OTHER things He's been saying and quietly dreaming into me.  I don't know when to tell, but soon He'll release me.  There is so much more to what I've seen in this life.  And God is SOO STINKIN EXCITED about showing it to me.    Guys, He's my Lover.  And yours.  'Lover of my soul...'  I prayed for that countless times as a child.  I wanted a lover of my SOUL who knew me inside and out.  AND didn't care I didn't even know myself yet.  He reaches His hands down, covers my heart, and soothes, energizes, and strengthens me.  That's the best way I can describe it right now.    There's so much He's got planned.  He's allowed this time of relative peace since I returned from St. Louis.  I'm not the "cheerleader" like I was.  Not that I won't ever be, just He's given me a rest.  I believe that once I'm in the intern house, there's going to be an explosion!!!!!!!  IN A GOOD WAY!  He's allowed new dreams to appear and new directions to take me feet where He wants.  This next phase?  Who knows?  I just know He's gonna keep me BUSY!!!!:)

      I am blessed to see how God is working in your life Anna.  You see, since I have known you, this has been a great area of weakness.  It's not that your future husband needs you for him, but it is your future husband that needs you to be Gods.  If you were to pick this up too quickly it would ruin both of you.  It is so important that you see past your current feelings and get into the vision of what God has for you.  Good leaders are able to see the consequences of the decisions further than their peers.  And this is what you must do.  You know that you are a born leader, and you must die to yourself, your dreams, your will and start to walk in maturity.  God desires to have you in all areas of your life, and this is the one that He has not ever got a commitment from you in.  God needs you to be His, and His alone.  Your choices no longer affect only you.  As a matter of fact, your choices will never again only affect you, but the countless 1000's of people you will touch by your leadership and servanthood.  You must look further beyond yourself, this has absolutely nothing to do with you, but it has everything to do with you (dynamic tension).  If you are going to be his sister in the Lord, then you must act like it.  Dying to your own desires, and protecting his purity, even when it comes to flirting, and spending time together.  You must stop being so selfish and acting like you are actually being a ministry tool for him.  In reality if this continues, all you will become is a stumbling block for him.  God doesn't need you to help to change him.  God would never put you into a position that would cause you to be a stumbling block to someone.  But in our own evil desires we are drawn away and enticed, and we become the bait that satan uses to snare someone else, and we call it righteous acts!  That's a bunch of hyper spiritual BS!  All it is, is a way that we justify our weakness so we can get what we want.  The process is a painful one, that requires us to continuously look inward at our heart and our motives, for God to reveal any wicked thing within us.  Anna, we are all guilty of this, no one is exempt.  You are an incredible woman of God with unlimited potential.  But potential never got anyone anywhere!  It is something that must be lived out, through the pains of growth and perseverance.  Keep pressin' hard baby girl, and stop laying down!  Fight for righteousness and holiness, these are the prizes we strive to attain.  Live the standard, be the model, set the example (1 Tim 4:12).  If you don't want others to look down on you, then this is what you must do!  I love you and I am very proud of you for allowing God to go to those places that are painful.  This is the price of righteousness, this is what you were called to, this is the example that Christ has set.  LIVE IT LOUD!  Much Love, Rob

      My last night at the Flying J was last night.  Peace.  Funny story, I almost didn't even make it in last night!:)  I'd set my cell phone alarm to wake me up at 9pm to have time for a shower and all that.  I don't know what happened, but the phone didn't wake me up!!!!!  It did decide to go off at 11:38 when it let me know I had a voice mail mess!  Of all things!  Work had been trying to call me on the cell and at home.  My family, God bless them, thought I wasn't there!!!!!!  Gotta love them.    When I did finally wake up, I was SOOOOOOO tempted to just go back to sleep and forget about it.  Ugh...  Conviction.  It was my last night, so who could blame me for going ahead and sleeping in?  I was already going to be EXTREMELY late...  They probably already called someone else in to cover for me........  Just couldn't do it!!!!!!!!  God kept telling me, "Integrity, Anna.  You asked to grow in it, well this is how it's done.  You want others to be able to show the same kind of integrity towards you, so you show them what you asked for."    I got up, scrubbed my WinnDixie feet (volleyball in the mud) and washed my face, put on my uniform and ran out the door!  My manager, who is a big fan of Joyce Meyer and knows that I was an intern at the St. Louis Dream Center supported by her, was so stinkin proud of me!!!haha  She honestly didn't think I'd come in and wasn't going to blame me if I didn't.  Needless to say, I had a great night.  I may also be able to help her get on at the park where my dad works.  She's been trying to get on there and needs a reference.  Ta da!  Me!    Anyway, that doesn't have a lot of significance compared to what else has been going on in my life since my last "official" blog.    I'd asked for prayer for a certain situation the last time I wrote and still need that prayer.  To give you a little insight as to what's going on, here's the deal.  I know God has this amazing man of God coming my way and He's preparing him in the most awesome and amazing way.  My problem with this process?  I obsess.    Ok, I'm gonna be dead-seious honest here.  I know who that man is.  Yes, Rob, I know.  And I've asked God to give me confirmation, confirmation, confirmation, confirmation, confirmation....  I've had it.  And I've also had some warnings from people about this whole thing.    Now, confirmation from God and then warning from man doesn't bode well for the well-being of my already worried brain.  Yes, I worry too much, I know.  And God has grown me in the area of true peace...  Especially in these areas.  But, (I hate but's) I've slipped back into the old way of worrying, fretting, and over-contemplating.  I get to dreaming about what it will be like to have someone constantly with me, encouraging me, needing me and I get side-tracked with all the dilemas and road blocks to the upcoming wedding!lol  (Yes, I said wedding.  I even think about that.)    Grrr!!!  Sometimes I really hate being a woman.  We women are so multi-tasking that we get ourselves into trouble in the area of ruling and tempering our thoughts.  One minute, I'm praying for my husband and his walk with God and the next, I'm thinkin' about what colors will be in the wedding, will he want me to work, what's going to happen with the girls' home....  Men, you just don't understand.  It's bad!  So, all these thoughts are plaguing my mind and not allowing me to really break out the prayer for my husband.  He really needs it right now and is under attack.  I guess I'm being attacked in the mind so I won't be able to pray and intercede for him like I need and want to.    This is so hard.  Not only do I need to pray for my husband, but right now he needs to be my friend.  AND JUST MY FRIEND!!!!!  If he's anything more than that to me at this time, I'll want to up and run away with him.  MUST THINK OF HIM AS BROTHER!!!!  Right, Rob?  Any other female alive will agree with me that this is one tough task.  And I am treating him as my brother.  I truly want him to hear what God has to say.  And I need God to continue kicking my own butt on MANY different issues.  So, he's my brother I obsess about.    See my problem?  In all honesty, this is affecting me more than it needs to.  From too many messed up relationships in the past, my nerves are shot.  This means now when I get worried or upset, my body goes into melt down.  It hasn't helped that I've been working too much, sleeping too little, and not spending quality "God-time."  Well, I've been physically ill again.    Guys, I prayed and asked God to heal me of this.  And He is.  Right now, I need you all to be praying I don't pick this back up again.  There is something coming up and God needs my full attention.  Pray my mind is eased from worry about him.  Pray I rest even my mind.  And please pray that peace returns.  I could use it.     *********************** (This has been another "Whoa-is-me-Blog."  Sorry.)

      I have so many things I want to tell you!&nbsp; So many great things God has been doing in me!&nbsp; I am so blessed because of the people God has put in my life.&nbsp; So Trebby I definitely agree with you enjoy it because it stretches you but knowing God is doing stuff to help you grow is just an awesome feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I wanted to share this story with you guys!! especially you guys!! While I was at camp Brandon Bealls told us a story.&nbsp; After that story I was like man a simple story that helps me explain what I am feeling.&nbsp; Anyway he talked about how one day he brought in a tank full of gold fish.&nbsp; During his youth meeting he took and dumped all these fish out on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know what happens when fish are not in water they flip around until they die!&nbsp; Well the kids were looking at these fish and got to the point where they could not take it anymore.&nbsp; They jumped up running to these fish and started grabbing them by the handfuls putting them back into the tank.&nbsp; There hearts were going out to the fish.&nbsp; They could not handle it that they might die so they had to save them.&nbsp; Come on now if your heart goes out to these fish and you are one who would of ran and scouped them up!&nbsp; Tell me why a little fish would mean so much however people who don't know God are dying!&nbsp; There are so many lost out there who need the fish tank and all it would take is for us to scoop them up and put them in there.&nbsp; I guess I am waiting for people to take their stand and stop being scared.&nbsp; Who wants to live of life of being scared all the time.&nbsp; I know I don't!!&nbsp; When are people going to realize its not about them!&nbsp; So your scared so what!&nbsp;YES its that easy to say so what! I will be real I get scared talking in front of people.&nbsp; I get to the point where I think I am going to puke! ITS&nbsp;a real feeling and I even start shaking!&nbsp; SO WHAT!&nbsp;I just deal with it and keep on going forward cause I know&nbsp;eventually God is going to take that crap away. &nbsp;I don't know about you but for me its what can I do for him.&nbsp; Yes I make mistakes on the way and maybe sometimes don't make the best decision!&nbsp; But I am enjoying the learning process.&nbsp; If you look at it like I need to be this good at this or wow if I fail I should give up!&nbsp; Then tell me how can you be happy worring all the time those things might happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandon also said one thing that I was just like YES YES! I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT!&nbsp; He said you know what the enemy hates more then a praying man,&nbsp; a pastor a evangelist........ He hates someone who won't GIVE UP!&nbsp; He hates more than anything someone who says sorry devil but I know what God has in store for me and its so much better.&nbsp; That alone guys makes me not even think about giving up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a little story I want to share about not giving up....  Sunday God gave me two visions!&nbsp; The first one was me sitting in church and chris coming up beside me and talking to me.&nbsp; Well not five minutes later it actually happened.&nbsp; Exactly as I saw it!&nbsp; I was just thinking weird!&nbsp; Well later on I realized why God did that.&nbsp; During worship God showed me something else.&nbsp; It was during worship!&nbsp; In my vision or whatever you want to call it I was also worshiping and my husband walks past me and kneels down at the alter!&nbsp; HOW AWESOME IS THAT! Then I realized he showed me the first one with Chris and it happened as I saw it.&nbsp; NOT TO GIVE UP! that its going to happen...my hubby is going to be saved.&nbsp;&nbsp; The funny thing is that is the one thing I know in my heart is going to happen.&nbsp; I know God is going to capture his heart.&nbsp; So I just thought God even though I trust you and have complete faith in you thank you I needed that.&nbsp; I needed to see that!&nbsp; So even when you don't know what you need God does.&nbsp; That is just so awesome to me!!&nbsp; I guess I could just express in words how awesome I feel.&nbsp; How HAPPY I am!&nbsp; I don't care what happenes to me!&nbsp; I don't care what God wants to do with me.&nbsp; I don't care how he does it.&nbsp; I am just glad he cares enough to help me and change me to be the best that I can be.&nbsp; That is sooooo exciting to me.&nbsp; THANK&nbsp; YOU JESUS!!&nbsp; I just want&nbsp; you to know that I love you guys and you are in my prayers daily!

      Hello,   I have not blogged in quiet some time, but I have enjoyed reading Kristie and Anna's blogging.&nbsp; I have been living at the intern home for almost a month and have really enjoyed it. I had great reservations before moving into this home, because I have lived on my own since I was 18 yrs old. I am 40 and most of the other people living there are half my age, but the ironic thing is the chemistry between myself and the other interns has been fantastic. I am blessed to be living under the same roof with such passionate lovers of Christ. We continue to use the word stretch, when describing what living communal does to each of us, and I couldn't&nbsp;agree more&nbsp;with that&nbsp;definition.&nbsp;This current situation does stretch all of us any many ways, but let's face it we could all use a good stretching occasionally...Living this way you give up&nbsp;certain privacies that you never really thought about before.&nbsp; This stretching for me has been long overdue...I plan on making the most of this opportunity and using it to draw closer to God, and in the process finding out what I am made of. I want everyone to know that I have chosen to live in this home, and quite frankly it has mystified most people that know me, because I have been on my own for so long...See I am the kind person that would be perfectly content with never having a phone, or for that much a computer...These things just don't matter to me. I am not sure how long I will be at the intern home, but for now I just want to enjoy this life experience   Trebby

      Where is everyone?&nbsp; I thought this was supposed to be a DC thing?&nbsp; And no one else but me n Kristie are ever utilizing this thing!!!!!:)&nbsp; Kristie, we must be too good of writers and are intimidate everyone else.&nbsp;   Anyway, here's the scoop on what God has been doing lately.&nbsp; AND THERE HAS BEEN QUITE A LOT!   God has asked me to go up on the mountain.&nbsp; And I'm scared to death of heights!&nbsp; Funny, but entirely too true.&nbsp;   Seriously, I've been used to being in the field and working for God.&nbsp; I'm a self-admitted "Martha."&nbsp; Now, though, God has asked me to stop working and start taking the trip up the mountain to come see Him for a while, to become a "Mary."&nbsp; What will I find up there?&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; And will I like being a "Mary?"&nbsp; Doubtful.&nbsp;   When I'm working, I feel needed.&nbsp; There's the absolute truth of the matter.&nbsp; And when I'm not working, I'm obviously not needed.&nbsp; So...&nbsp; There's a loss of importance.&nbsp; SELF-importance.&nbsp; And self is what has to die if I'm even to see God.&nbsp; I know, I know.&nbsp;   My family was and is a household where work ethics are STRONGLY pushed and adhered to.&nbsp; If you weren't working on SOMETHING constructive, then you were the weak link in the family.&nbsp; Growing up, I don't know how many sports or extracurricular activities I was in.&nbsp; But if I didn't have practice of some sort, then I was told I had to get a job and work.&nbsp; Once I was older, working became an even higher priority than all the extracurricular activites combined.&nbsp; Mom and Dad, especially Dad, said that work was more important because it was making me a productive member of society as well as the family.&nbsp;   See where being a "Martha" was exalted over the "Mary?"&nbsp;   If I wasn't working, then I wasn't productive and productivity was the only thing praised in my family.&nbsp; Obviously, if I wanted any praise, then I must work and excell to receive that praise.&nbsp; And MarthaAnna was born.&nbsp;   As a child, I was a dreamer.&nbsp; And one of the biggest liars ever!!!!&nbsp; I'd make up stories you wouldn't believe and had my parents usually convinced!&nbsp; Needless to say, once they learned that they were just made-up stories, that's when the enforcement of productivity kicked in.&nbsp; If I was working, I hadn't any time to dream, to make up stories...&nbsp; Or enjoy being a silly kid.&nbsp;   Not only did the dreaming stop and the work begin, but by this time, both my parents had to go into the work force.&nbsp; And I had to take care of my brothers, as well as myself.&nbsp; I became Mom and annoying older sister&nbsp;overnight.&nbsp; My poor mom didn't have any choice but to go back to work.&nbsp; And I didn't have any choice but to become what my mother couldn't be.&nbsp; My dad, well he was&nbsp;so tired after work, he didn't have time to be both Dad and Mom let alone the energy.&nbsp; So, the MarthaAnna kicked into gear and I forgot what it was like to dream, to be silly, and just be.&nbsp;   Now...&nbsp; Oh, God.&nbsp; Now, I have to go back to that point where I stopped growing dreams, stopped imagining and start where I left off.&nbsp;   I've known God all my life.&nbsp; Thank God for Godly parents!&nbsp; But, I stopped dreaming about Him, seeking His calming presence and I started working for Him.&nbsp; Work was praised in the home, so God must praise the work, more than just being.&nbsp;   And I wasn't touched as a child.&nbsp; Not once my brothers were born.&nbsp; Sure, I was picked up when I fell.&nbsp; And I was hugged when I cried because one of the boys hit me.&nbsp; But outside that, I wasn't touched just because.&nbsp; There wasn't that affirmation of love for me, so I assumed that WASN'T an affirmation.&nbsp; Know what I mean?&nbsp; And I carried this over to my relationship with God and thought that since I was working, and THROWING myself into His work, then I was affirming and having affirmed God's love for me.&nbsp; Therefore, I didn't expect a touch from God outside of the instances when I fell or was hurt by someone else.&nbsp; God doesn't just HOLD His children.&nbsp; He has them WORK for Him and for the glory of His kingdom.&nbsp; Holding is for newborn babies and very young children, not for the "big kids."   See where I'm going with all this?&nbsp; God has called me up on the mountain so He can touch me, hold me, and just let me be what He made me be.&nbsp; There aren't any demands or expectations.&nbsp; There isn't a code of work ethic to follow during this time.&nbsp; There's just me and God.&nbsp; And a new kind of love to experience.&nbsp;   I'm terrified of this kind of love.&nbsp; I've never had it before.&nbsp; And it's exactly what I looked for in the countless wrong relationships I've had with men.&nbsp; I looked for the touch, the holding.&nbsp; And found a dead end.&nbsp; Will I find another dead end with God?&nbsp; Will He leave me when it's over?

      My title is tow-fold.&nbsp; There is everybody, and where is everybody.&nbsp; Where is everyone on here?&nbsp; Why haven't they been blogging?  &nbsp;  And where is everyone when I need them?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yes, I'm alone primarily because I CHOOSE to be alone.&nbsp; But this is different.&nbsp; I'm alone right now.&nbsp; And I feel (yes, more EMOTIONS) completely without real, true friends.&nbsp; Know what I mean?&nbsp; Kristie does, I know.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Not that any of my current friends aren't as real as could be.&nbsp; It's just that I'm made differently.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Here's a good example.&nbsp; Anyone evern read 'Anne of Green Gables?'&nbsp; Kindred spirits.&nbsp; That's what I don't have.&nbsp; In fact, the only time I've really ever had a kindred spirit...&nbsp; They just disappeared.&nbsp; Was is beacuse of me?&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; Was it that they were in all reality just flakes?&nbsp; Could be.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Right now, God, I could use someone who already knows what's in my head.&nbsp; They can see it, call it out, and confront me with it.&nbsp; My friend Craig is like that.&nbsp; Problem?&nbsp; He's in Alabama.&nbsp; And he can be a bit of a flake at times.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yes, God.&nbsp; I know You are all of the above.&nbsp; But I could really use You using someone here on earth to do all of these things.&nbsp; (Sounds like I'm choosing my own blessings!:)  &nbsp;  I need someone in my face, in front of me, who knows what is going on and can help me think through all these things without me feeling like they are unequal to me.&nbsp; I need someone here on my level to hash these things through with me that won't come at me in an authorative manner, "spiritual" manner, or ignorant manner.  &nbsp;  Man, that sounds harsh!&nbsp; But I don't mean it that way.&nbsp; I just mean I need someone completely unbiased by other opinions but has enough knowledge and wisdom to wisely help guide me through this time.&nbsp; Make any sense?  &nbsp;  God, I honestly don't care whether or not it is a man or a woman, same age or not.&nbsp; I just need someone THERE with me.&nbsp; Maybe they don't even have to talk, or maybe they have wisdom enough not to talk at all.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm pushy, I know.&nbsp; Lord, help.&nbsp; That's all I know what to say.&nbsp; Help.

      Oh, guys..  This crap is hard.  And it is CRAP!  Had a talk with Rob last night.  Started out as a conversation about the job situation and it ended up being about the girls' home...  And timing.  Guys, this just guts me.  WHY, GOD?  Why?    Rob wants and believes this is my winter season.  I know. I knew this already.  And I didn't want it to come.  Especially not now.  I wanted ACTION!  Let me have the winter AFTER the girls' home starts.  Not now, God.  I'm ready to go NOW!  Let's get this thing started so the many hurting girls I see have someplace SAFE to go to.  And not have to worry about every burden placed or brought on by them.  Especially after what I learned about one of my girls today.  Just found out that one of my girls, just a teenager, was forced to have an abortion by her mother.  She's had it and there's nothing anybody can do about that now.  BUT SHE IS HURTING!!!    She had no where else to turn.  So, now she feels condemned for life because of her actions.    It is so hard trying to show her God's love and all-covering grace.  She can't see through her pain right now to even remotely try to comprehend the fact that Someone loves her.  AND NOW!!!!!!!!!!!  I have to wait on God to finish a work in me.  To wait and just serve....  And watch the hurting continue with there being nothing in my power to do.  Yes, it never has been in my power.  And it never will.  But, God!!!!  Why is it burning so in my heart?  Only for You to say, "Wait?"  Dear God...  Help!

      What's the deal, y'all?  Kristie, the very person who usually is so quiet about personal things, is kickin out butts on here!!!  She's blogged more than any of us now!:)  Praise God for it, too!!!  You rock, Kristie.  Man, when I think of when I first met you...  How reserved you were with things of yourself and your life...  And now!!!  ROCK ON, SISTER!   Ok.  Now that I have a little bit of time, I wanted to tell you all about what happened this Sunday.  (Yeah, I know.  It's Friday now.  Who cares??!?!?!)    For a while, my joy had disappeared and I'd literally been PUTTING ON joy...  I wasn't living joyously.  In fact, when I looked into the mirror at myself, my eyes were so droopy and void of life.  It's hard to explain unless you knew me.  See, I'm one of those annoying people that is joyful at all times.  It takes more than a monsoon of emotions to usually overwhelm me.  And not being able to be joyous just because I WAS, that was hard.  I'm very good at acting, I've found, and can fool even the most discerning person.  (Used to be proud of this fact.)  But these past few months, the mask of the actress was slipping.    Anyway, back to Sunday.  I was fighting hard to get back the joy I'd lost along with the HOPE I couldn't seem to find.  In the back of the sanctuary, I was worshipping and struggling, like usual, to keep my mind off of the things which were PLAGUING me.  At one point, I just got really quiet with God and was waiting.    My eyes were closed, but they FELT open.  I was standing in the middle of a field full of flowers and SCREAMING at the top of my lungs, with my arms thrown wide, "FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  There's no way in the state I was in that I could even FATHOM this kind of freedom.  It used to be I would go down to the lake, any time day or night, and sit on my favorite rock and sing songs, whisper secrets, or cry out to God.  I hadn't been down there in MONTHS!!!!  Actually, it's been over a year since I went down by myself and waited for God.    So, when God showed this vision of me screaming out to Him...  There was no way that was me!!!!!  Not even two SECONDS after the vision left, a lady from church came forward with a word of knowledge from God.  She said someone had been struggling with this thing, this dark crevice.  It was such a struggle that it was in the stomach and in the bowels.  She said it was so painful, she couldn't stand and couldn't breath and that's how this person was living...  That was me.    This thing that stole my joy, it had affected my very health and had made me sick for several months now.  My weight has fluctuated from the stress put on my body through this.  And it was in my stomach and in my bowels.  I went forward, sank to my knees from the weight of this thing, and the woman held my head in her lap and prayed.  (I saw later many other women were there praying as well.)  TALK ABOUT SOME MAJOR BATTLE!!!!!  These amazing women of God went to the mattresses for me!!!  They fought for my freedom in the spiritual realm!!!  And they won.  After we were done praying, I didn't know what else to do.  So, I stayed at the front a little while longer and worshipped.  Well, the vision came back.  This time, the field of flowers changed to the faces of my church.  And when I screamed freedom in the vision, I screamed freedom in the church, in reality.    I DIDN'T CARE!!!!!  Freedom was MY gift.  It was HIS sacrifice for me to have that freedom.  And I was claiming it!  And I was joyous in it!!!!!  Freedom...  I was free!!!!!!!!!!!  A while later, I went to the back of the sanctuary again.  I wanted a little distance to find God alone for a bit.  When I went back, the dance began!!!!!  Guys, I've not been one to just start dancing.  But Sunday, I was.  And I didn't care if I looked like a fool.  I just didn't care.   A little girl came to the back to dance with me.  She was adorable.  God showed me I was a girl again.  I WAS DANCING like I was a child again.  No longer the servant, but the CHILD God made and then later chose.  I was young, new, and pure.    Purity.  With hope.  New hope.  And new life, like Rob said.   New life.  No bars or bondages.  Just freedom.  With joy back.  :)

      I am so sorry God for being so selfish! It is not about me! Being here is not about me! It is about making a choice to let you use me to help the lost, forgotten and the broken.  I am so tired of the selfishness that people have.  I am tired of being one of the those people.  Help me have a heart that is all about you.  It is so hard Lord to really break down the walls to forget the words that are spoken to me.  The words are like a million paper cuts in my heart! Help my attitude even to be always full of joy!  I am so sick of the sadness and the hurt feelings.  I don't want it anymore I only want more of you Lord..ONLY YOU!!  I want to see my husband as YOU see him!! I beg you to change my heart...Please change my heart.

      I only have a few minutes before I leave work!  However I wanted to share something with you guys!! God has been doing amazing things in my life!  He is teaching me how to die!! He is teaching me and taking away all the hurt, bitterness and unforgiveness.  In August I have been married for 10 years and there is a lot of emotional pain especially when God is not in your life.   There have been times that I hurt so bad that I could not feel anything.  I just did not care from one day to the next.  I put so many walls up and Praise God he is showing me how to break them down.  The enemy is not going to win the war!! Yeah I have not been strong in the past (and lost many battles) because I did not know the glory of God in my life.  I am taking my marriage and my husband back.  The enemy is NOT going to win..   With Gods help I continue to die and learn to pray for my hubby.  Its funny cause I finally realized in order to change my hubby I NEED GOD to change me.  AND even then its not me that is going to change him.. I can't put that fire in him that I have for the Lord.  He has to get it on his own.  I am just so excited because I love him Soooo much!!  I can't wait until we are praying every night together.  I can't wait to have the blessings that we will get for not giving up!!  I know deep down what God wants for me and my husband!!  WhoooHoooo!!

      This one is for me just as much as for anyone reading this. And, *****DISCLAIMER***** this won't be easy to read.  Yes, Faith Without Works... Is dead!!!!!  Remember Jesus saying this? That's right, He said it. And He meant it.  Now, why aren't we listening and FOLLOWING this teaching? Perhaps it's because we each define works as something different. Ok, then. Let's look at a perfect example of the works of Jesus. THERE'S where we can find our standard of works.  When Jesus was allowed to start telling the world the truth of Who He is, He immediately began walking and bringing up under Him. DISCIPLES! What does "The Great Commission" say?  Go out into ALL the world and make disciples. THIS DOESN'T MEAN GO OUT AND FIND SOME PEW WARMERS! He said to make disciples out of all the world!!!!! No exceptions.  Ok, Anna. What have you made? What kind of people have you brought in? Are they pew warmers? Or are they true disciples? Do they have a BURNING within them to go out and make disciples just like they were made? Do they want to continue the legacy begun by Christ Himself then perpetuated by you?  Well... To be completely honest, there have been more pew warmers made than actual disciples. Why is that? I haven't continued with them. I showed them the truth and lived the life of a Godly woman in front of them.... But I didn't turn them into disciples. Why?!?!?! I thought,  'That's all I needed to do. I just needed to show them the way. God will do the rest.'   Yes, my God is an awesome, AMAZING God. But He needs  US  to be His hands, His feet, His mouth to his people. And not just for a one time experience, but for a lifetime of discipleship!!!!! This isn't a "program" where we are enlisted to sign up 5 different people and then have them sign up 5 more people... etc. This is a LIFESTYLE! This is a life totally different from selling magazine subscriptions or Mary Kay. Get this! This is a way of life! Not to be taken lightly, I'll add.  Y'all are thinkin,  'Ok, what's gotten into her britches!?!?'  I went to Harp and Bowl last night, our prayer time at church, and had to get up and leave the room because I was so frustrated. And the frustration was with myself as well as with those in the room. I know I wasn't the only one who felt this way either.  I was  'righteously indignant'  about how our city, county, and region has been praying for hope to come for   GENERATIONS   ! I'm not talking about praying for a revival of this area with praying for a few weeks. What I'm saying is this; since this area was populated, we've been praying for hope to come here. We've wanted hope for the indians, hope for the "wayward" laggard or drunk, hope for our government, and now hope for EVERYONE not saved and living a life of sin.    Why hasn't this "GREAT HOPE" come?  DUH!!!!!!!!  Because we've been praying for it inside of our churches and in our homes. WE HAVEN'T BEEN OUT GIVING THE VERY HOPE WE ARE PRAYING FOR FOR OTHERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How can we expect God to work a miracle of hope if we are terrified of getting out of our home churches or plain ole homes?   WE ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD!    And where there is light, there is hope.  'Light at the end of then tunnel. A light in dark times.'    We are light, we are hope, AND we are the only thing keeping us from finding that great revival we've all so desperately wanted to come to our area. Heck, our country!   Sure, I've been prideful and full of myself and said, "Nobody else can say that they are actually living for God like I can. I'm living in the intern house, afterall." God, forgive me!!!!! I haven't been living. I've been HIDING! I've been hiding in the intern house, behind programs for God, and forgot all about the WORK for God.  I have faith and have been called a woman of faith. But if my works aren't there, and the fruit certainly isn't, then my faith is   DEAD   ! Do you guys get this? DEAD!!!!! As in not LIVING!    What can I do, God? Yes, ask your forgiveness. Ok, then. God, PLEASE forgive me for being so stuck in what I thought was living for You. Change my ideas, change my heart so that I might have YOUR heart. And now? MAKE ME BOLD!!!!!! Show me the ways You want me to work for You. And don't just show me. SHOW THEM!!!!! Show whoever is reading this. BURN their hearts, burn with correction and with passion. Burn me, God. BURN ME!!!!!!!

      Wow, it's been a long time since I wrote.  It has been an exciting, crazy month.  Moving into the intern house, the Project, has been awesome.  I love everyone who lives there so much and we are really able to encourage and minister to each other.  It has also been a very stretching month for me.  Last night I was reading my journals from over a year ago, when I was still in school.  I guess I had forgotten what it felt like, but I wrote over and over again how I felt so frustrated going to school and not being able to do ministry the way I knew I needed to.  I wrote that I had to bury the passion that consumed me so deep inside just to make it through the school days.  Man, am I glad God is allowing me to begin to walk in my calling.  Rob always says, "I'm living a dream." That is truly how I feel.  At the Kidz Crusade, one of the girls God really placed on my heart from day one got saved for real.  I am so excited to see what God is going to do  in her life.  53 kids got saved total, out of 75 in attendance, 10 of whom were my helpers.  What was incredible was that most of the kids at the cursade came from Stonegate and Hospital Heights, the 2 neighborhoods in which we do Metro Kidz. When I first came here, I figured I would be a dream center intern, and run Metro Kidz in Hospital Heights and that was it.  Boy was I wrong.  I had no clue how God would enlarge my heart towards our community.  I can't imagine not doing this now.  I used to question whether or not I even wanted to do ministry full time because I wanted to live more for me.  I thought that would make me happier, yet I am happier now than ever.  Focusing on others makes it so my issues seem so small.  I know that my strength only comes in my weakness, so that Christ's strength can be made perfect in me.  That is the only way I can do what I do.     We're living a dream!!!!!!

      This weekend was another "God" weekend.  Well, it's all God's anyway.  It's just that sometimes I actually REALIZE that and give Him what's His already.   Anyway!  I was supposed to have gone to the Gig like usual, the radio show we do on Sat. nights, but God had other plans.  I couldn't even tell Rob I wasn't going without breaking down into tears.  (SUCH a girl!)  But, I did.  And God was there.  I did nothing that night other than play my keyboard and do a ton of worship.  At one point, I had to even stop that.  There was some worship music in the CD player, so I let God do what He wanted and laid down on the floor, spread-eagle, and waited.   Man, did He ever tell me some things.  Keep in mind, I didn't let them go into full effect until mid-Sunday.  Point is, they were spoken into me on Sat. night, then God started RAINING DOWN!!!!!  (Those worship songs were right on.)  I've told you all that God has me up on the mountain for a while.  And it sucks.  But ROCKS!  I have an excuse for saying "no" now.  I can say no.  BECAUSE God said to.  No more working for the time being.  No more delaying and putting off what God has been trying to teach me.  It's NOW.  My time is now.  And I am SUPPOSED to be completely selfish with what God is currently giving me.  Yes, later on God will want and demand that I give out what He's given me.  Though, for now, He's given it to me FOR me.  I'm not used to that.  I'm so different from when I came home.  Just six months ago, and I've completely changed.  Hard to believe I needed to change that much.  Guess I did!  I must have been a real JERK!:)  Anyway.  I'm healing.  And I have less to say.  I'm not supposed to.  So, WHEN ARE THE REST OF YOU GOING TO START SAYING ANYTHING?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?
