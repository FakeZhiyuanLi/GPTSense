       I'm reading the Sword of Truth series for the third time. It's an odd thing because the series is not very good, but I somehow forget that fact within a year or so of reading it. The story is very passive and told in a mindlessly repetitive way with heaps of dull filler. The characters turn every molehill into a mountain and leave me scratching my head as to why they're so upset. In style and (lack of) substance it reminds me so strongly of the Shannara series that I've wondered if Terry Goodkind and Terry Brooks are really the same person. Both series have made a lot of money, though, and I've never heard anyone else who shares my opinion, so perhaps my point of view is in error. Still, it doesn't seem right to have two principal characters who are out saving the world yet who can't help but break down in tears every few pages. The notion that this pair would have the emotional fortitude to face the monumental problems that arise is simply absurd.  I see my negativity is getting carried away. I have never written a fantasy megaseries so I don't know the challenges involved. Even Robert Jordan, whose Wheel of Time series started out  much  stronger than Sword of Truth, has lost control and is wandering aimlessly. Maybe these things are just too big for a single author to handle.

       Canadian Superior Energy has been recovering nicely the past several sessions. I actually moved back into the green today, which pleases me greatly. I managed to dump two-thirds of my position in the minutes following the company's announcement that they were abandoning the Mariner well last March. I sold at $3.10 for a slight loss (sadly, I became aware of the company too late, after the runup) and kept a third, thinking it would bounce off $2-2.50 once everyone realized the well, while not commercially viable, had still been an exploratory success. Unfortunately panic set in and the price fell further. Then came the blood-sucking ambulance-chasers to file frivolous class-action lawsuits and put even more pressure on the stock. I started buying back in at $2 and accumulated more down to $1.14, ending up with a $1.66 average. I admit that when the price dipped under $1 my confidence wavered, but I was determined to stick it out with this company, knowing what a bright future they have. The market seems to be gradually recognizing that the lawsuits will amount to nothing and that SNG has a lot of potential. There is something uniquely satisfying about surviving a test of fire, although I don't suppose I would complain if every stock I bought simply went up from the moment of purchase. Go SNG!

       So this is a blog. Hmm. I have heard passing references to the phenomenon of blogging but never gave it much thought before. My attention became more focused after repeated mention of the subject by Bambi Francisco (ignore her at your peril) since I find her to be quite insightful. It is difficult to imagine that anyone else will ever read this blog, surrounded as it is like a raindrop in the sea. Perhaps blogging is nothing more than an exercise in narcissism. Maybe, though, it allows us to express in a free way thoughts that would otherwise be lost, discarded, or censored in our deadline weary, self-involved, politically correct society. Like a child with a doll or an imaginary friend, we can pretend we have an audience; that someone cares. Maybe it's just a convenient way to get things off our chests. Maybe it's a grand scheme concocted by Big Business to develop the ultimate marketing strategy. I wonder....  I had thought to begin this blog with something inventive, charming, and laced with sly wit. Of course, that would have required some talent that eludes me, so instead I decided to run with a "testing 1...2...3" type of thing. Now I see that I have rambled on somewhat farther than that. Ah, well. Maybe that's the point.
