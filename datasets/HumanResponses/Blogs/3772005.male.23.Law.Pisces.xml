      wow, what a day! mike and i had a freaking blast buying this and that. class was the funnest i've ever had, even though the firm wasn't complete. almost felt like the good old days. tomorrow will be ever better though at lyndsie lohan's place. i bought boondock saints on dvd, which everyone should be running out to buy! and the ataris and the cure on cd. we even had a party in class with some chips and dip man. and funions. and a whole lot of water. can't even tell you how bad the class would have sucked if i didn't have that six pack of..be..soooda. =) and mad props to kim tonight! she gets a gold star. looks like my bro ryan didn't get his drumline into nationals. let me tell you this though, those freaking kids would have owned that little competition! sorry bud, maybe another time. anyways my children, i'm out. as Mr. LJ would say, GNSTDLTBBB.

      *sigh* so yeah, today was not the best of days. what a waste of wearing my new shirt. you know how much this shirt cost me??? anyways, i've got a headache, too much homework, nothing to do (that i want to do), i'm alone right now, class sucked, seating arrangments don't seem to work, i'm starving, and as always i should have the staring role in the movie Heavyweights. but not all is bad i guess. i succeeded in not annoying too many people today. and i got a comment about my hair looking like i got a haircut, which i assume is good since i really need a haircut. prolly best news today is that the firm's gonna dance the afternoon away on thursday. sooo looking forward to that. luckily i get paid soon so i can blow all my bling on dvds and cds. woohoo!! i guess the lesson of the day is to keep one's mouth shut and don't let fervent emotions take hold. no word from kar. hope she's doing well wherever she is. tonights gonna be another long one...see ya on the flip.

      Next up:  Chinatown  (1974)   The Whole Nine Yards  (2000): Don’t see it. Wasn’t funny or dramatic, so not sure what they were intending.  Its got nothing on Analyze This. It dragged and the score sucked, but Willis and Perry were quite believable.  However their wannabe falling in love after 2 minutes is not.  The good news is that I have one less sequel to see.  so yeah, my principles in public administration class is gonna suck. DOWN WITH THE WANNABE 21 YEAR OLD PROFESSOR!! anyways, glad my fellow firm-mates are in it with me. and speaking of, lyndsie's lip is looking mighty fine again. bought Clinton's book. can't wait to tackle that beast. who knows when that will be though. time is running scarce these days. still have to start practicing for the LSATs and summer is already half-way over. so 3/4 of the firm is ready to dump this state and jet to florida for law school. just gotta work on miss fowkes now. thats about it for now. i hate my job, i mean, its freakin cake, but so boring. anyone have any advise on how i can get better sleep at night instead of tossing and turning? i'm all for a white russian before calling it a night, but i'm thinkin its not going to happen. bought a freaking tight bookcase for the living room for my photo albums and books. thats the highlight of the week, well, not really, but i won't mention my real highlights. not sure if i can even tell myself...

       “If you had an infinite number of monkeys sitting at an infinite number of typewriters for an infinite number of years typing at random then it could be accepted that one would eventually type the entire works of Shakespeare”   So I was thinking about the above hypothetical scenario last night as I was trying to sleep and came up with how it is true.  First, let’s imagine that all we are hoping from the monkeys is not the entire collected works of Shakespeare, but simply “Et tu Brute.”  The comma has been removed to make this example a bit simpler, but there are 11 characters in that line from Caesar.  Let’s assume the typewriters that the monkeys are using have 27 characters; 26 for the alphabet and 1 for the space bar.  So the number of possibilities of 11 character phrases, using 27 keys, can be written as 27^11, (or 27 multiplied by itself 11 times).  This equates to 1 in 5,559,060,566,555,523 of making the above line from Caesar.  As large as this number is, especially for such a small phrase, it is not infinite.  Eventually “Et tu Brute” will be written, either on the first try, 27^11th try, or most likely somewhere in between.  Not going to try and figure out how long it would take a monkey to get through all 27^11 possibilities, but let’s just say it’s a really long time.  Now let us turn “Et tu Brute” into what is being asked of the monkeys; all of Shakespeare.  Now the possibilities rise to a number that I can’t even fathom.  But again, this number if finite, and the monkeys have a long time to work on it.  Finally, given the fact that there are an infinite number of simians working on it, this will greatly reduce the time to create it, and with a truly infinite number, I guess theoretically his works would be created simply in the time it would take to type it all out.

      Currently:  The Whole Nine Yards (2000)   Special Mention:  Vanilla Sky  and  Lost in Translation . does it get any better?   Amadeus (1984) : almost not worth making it all the way till the end, but then you realize what near perfection in movie-making it is. however, as good as it is, just not as entertaining as i like. see it on the dreariest of days.   Big Fish (2003) : dragged at points, but very well done. not sure how an ending can be so perfect, and not a word is said. strangely, i have to say that this should be bought.   The Terminal (2004) : Oscar Oscar Oscar!!! ended not the way i wanted, but still way worth seeing!

      here are a few of the fine purchases recently made:   new video card  taking back sunday - where you want to be  jimmy eat world - static prevails  heat - you know, one of the greatest movies ever!  plane ticket for my return trip from denver   that's it for now. i'm sure more to follow. so i was checking out the latest law school rankings. kinda sad because all my big picks are going in the wrong direction. BYU from #31 to #34; University of Utah from #40 to #47; CU Boulder from #40 to #50. ouch! on a lighter though, University of Florida went from #45 to #43 and University of Washington from #45 to #34. And Pepperdine finally cracked the list at #99.  not much going down lately. worked on my monday class presentation yesterday at work for a whole 30 minutes. going to see a movie tonight. either i, robot or the village. sad to see the village got so many bad reviews. looks like kim doesn't want to go all out on her car. fine by me. just more money to put into the system for my jeep. can't wait to see miss lyndsie lee's new pad. she should be all moved in i think.  speaking, its just a matter of time before the law firm files for chapter 7. any bets on when this will take place. vegas has 10 to 1 odds it won't last the first month of this coming semester. they also have 3 to 1 that the four of us will sell our rights to NBC and become the next reality show. we sure got the drama for it. well, i think i'm going to sit here at work and listen to my tunes. i won't count on me getting any homework done while i'm here. if you need me, you know where to find me. counting the minutes is what i do best.

      why do we like to be sad? i feel content right now because i'm sad. i love being in love and i love being sad. there has got to be something wrong with that. it is so not normal. i wish i could be happy, but i'm so content when i'm like this. i just got done with my last episode of Six Feet for a while to come. yes, the ending sucked, but it ended the only way it could; perfect. now i'm here listening to this song, this perfect sad song. its like JEW's Clarity album. sad and amazing. for anyone who cares, Something Corporate - Konstantine. i never want to leave this chair. i want to keep feeling like this.  i feel like i'm being pulled each and every direction. some pull me into&nbsp;adulthood, whatever that means. then some try to keep me at 19 years old. i don't know where i am right now. i want to be 19, and i've considered myself 19 for four years now. but when i look at someone like lyndsie, she seems so young. i know i'm not 19 anymore when i see her&nbsp;and it breaks my heart. what am i then? what is 23? should i be acting more like a parent or responsible? even if i should, what if i don't want to? why do i have to follow someone's time table? what about my time table? am i trying to set the world record for most consecutive questions in one paragraph? its obvious i don't want to grow up, but i'm willing to accept the fact that i'll never be 19 again. i wish that was enough for everyone. that's probably why i love being alone. i can live how i want, no criticism for what i do. how can anyone be happy? i don't understand how anyone my age can just have a happy life. there is so much crap in the world and the drama runs knee deep every step of the way. maybe this is just the way it is and i need to find a better way to just get used to it, become more tolerable. thought of something in a kind of funny/morbid way, but i was thinking that just in case bad crap happens, i could always have a backup plan waiting in the wings, but what is my backup plan to life?  on another subject, i bought a new video card online. i'm sure this one won't work either and i'll be screwed, out another hundred bucks. speaking of handing out my money, feel pretty good today cuz i made a little contribution to our next president. i got flamed by my wife today when i told her i was doing it, and i'm sure i'll get more crap from others, but i know i would have regretted it had i not done it. my weekend of work starts tomorrow. i'm already looking forward to monday.  when i'm in law school, i'm going to go back to marching again. do you know how good i could have been had i kept playing from high school till now? i know this is just some way for me to hold on to something i lost a long time ago, but all i have is the past. i barely have a grip on today, and the future is something that seems i'll never catch up to. its funny because if i do end up doing it, i'll be the only one. everyone will either have graduated school altogether or just got sick of it years prior. i'm sure by then standley lake won't even have a music program. it'll just be me living in my fantasy world. and some of you might be thinking i'm nuts right now, but i guarantee that a good portion of you will be my neighbors in fantasy world. 19 or 23, some of us are having the hardest time growing up.

      Rain Man (1988): dustin hoffman annoyed the crap out of me in this movie, so i guess he did deserve his oscar. tom cruise was believable, however the changes he went through from beginning to end were not. and his character conflicted a ton. one minute he is&nbsp;a clever business man who can work people like magic, the next he's an idiot who can't understand why his brother acts like a retard (could it be because he kind of is?). the music also stank of cheesy yuppie 80's electronica (and this from the same guy who wrote music for gladiator and the last samurai). even though the performances were good, as well as the cinematography, its not worth seeing. i just wasn't feeling it. the movie didn't flow right to me.  Dawn of the Dead (1978): yes, this is the original, which is the sequel to night of the living dead. first, the bad. it is cheesy. half the music is terrible, the other half is wisely done. the acting is not the greatest. there are continuity issues left and right. the story never ends (in fact, the last chapter of the trilogy is day of the dead, although i won't be seeing that because there is no ending to that either). now the good. the blood is about as much as kill bill vol. 1. the special effects are kinda humorous, but really good for its time. it can still be appreciated 25 years later. and this is extremely entertaining. i haven't seen the remake of it (i'll see it in about a month), so i can't compare to that, but as far as a horror movie goes, this is one of the best i've seen. see it.

      this pompous jerkoff started throwing my computer&nbsp;speakers and something else. i can't really remember. think it might have been my cell phone. i start shaking, knowing that physical confrontation is going to be inevitable. its the feeling i used to get when my step dad would always get right in my face to tell me if i'm such a man, we could go to the garage and i could prove it. i always backed down. this time i didn't. with ryan's help, we beat the crap out of him. kim called the cops. tom just sat in the car talking to beth propeck. thanks for the help buddy. afterward, my day began.  yesterday's first hour of the day had so much&nbsp;potential. then it all went to hell. i was alone, writing this, had just got my dance game, then i get a call from my sis saying their car broke down on the way home to colorado. luckily they had only gotten like 5 miles away. so i pick them up, get the car towed, and wait for the answer from the repair shop. looks like its the timing belt. and why wouldn't it be right? i mean, right when you are planning to go home, more than 500 miles away, that's the best time for it to break. so she just left that here to get fixed and took one of our cars. we'll just switch in august when i go back.  but at least i have my dance game...or do i? my video card has always been a piece ever since i put the computer together. for example, sometimes i can't play new games that i buy for it. pretty cool for like a $250 video card huh? well, when you mess with my dance game, you cross the line. so after i buy a new one today, i will destroy that piece of shit to a million pieces. and all those lovely ATI canadian tech support faggots can go to hell (nothing against canadia, i'm sure its quite pretty during this time of year).  as always though, did have a fun time with the study group. as always though, didn't get much done either. however we did plan a lot of things if that counts for something. and the night was capped off by a little six feet. today will be the season finale of season 2. i am soooo freaking excited to see it! i'm going to be lost without anymore episodes. season 3 probably won't come out on dvd for months, if not another year. i could buy 1 and 2 on dvd, but kim isn't letting me. we'll see about that. i have gotten a few good recommendations for other shows to occupy my time. ryan said 24 is worth seeing, and i know its already got matt's grade A approval. and some lady at work said to start working on the sopranos. this has got my brother's, patti's, and the rest of the U.S.'s approval. we'll see. gotta find something that kim will watch too. don't think either is her cup o' tea.  this is getting long, but i don't care right now. if you are concerned that its too long, then go away. there isn't enough free space for all these negative thoughts for the both of us. colorado is looking better and better for august, however kim still needs a bit of convincing. to know why, lets first lay out the tentative plans:   i drive my mom's car, she drives her car  meet in glenwood springs  stay 2 nights at an undisclosed location, to be possibly revealed at another date  she drives back to utah, i continue on  stay in colorado for a few days/week  fly back   i'm all for her coming with me, but it might be just too hard for her to get the time off. i on the other hand am working like maddddd these next couple of weeks, so i swear they better give me the time off. i do so much for those people. anyways, kim just doesn't like&nbsp;me being alone in colorado. she wasn't too fond of tom's roommates, and just this and that and blah blah blah. i told her that his roommates are now down to 1, and he was the loser of the 3 roommates. (just kidding curtis. would i bite your ass if i didn't like you?) so yeah, i keep telling her i'm gonna be fine and there won't be anymore hit and runs, but i can see what she is saying. but we all know ethan is a good boy. i'm a freakin angel. =)  okay. now i'm getting annoyed this is so long. i got a few more issues i'd like to bring up, but another time i suppose. until then...  This is to a girl who got into my head  With all the pretty things she did  Hey  You know  You keep me up in bed  by the way, i couldn't sleep last night

      i hate midterms where its nothing but writing pages of BS. that's what i did for 2 hours yesterday. combined with the hours of studying beforehand makes for a sore hand. but i think we all did pretty decent. combine our grade there and our extra credit on pretty much anything, i don't feel too bad going into the final. and points for carolyn for not bringing enough copies of the exam or a freaking stapler. and the hiccup girl has got to go!  i feel bad for my sister. all she does is kinda hang around at home and watch tv. granted, there is nothing to do in utah anyways, but still. she must be bored out of her mind. glad she didn't have to waste money on a plane ticket.  ryan said i should see spiderman 2, but for those who aren't aware, let me elaborate on the matter. the distributors of spiderman (sony) are little bitches. two years ago when the first one came out, they decided to open the movie a week before attack of the clones. they freaking stole the spotlight of one of the greatest sagas in movie history, which would account for why attack of the clones only made the 11th on the all time grossing list, and spiderman made 5th. i would have liked to have seen them do that, had star wars come out a week before them. little bastards! movies should work together (for the most part) to benefit each other. did you ever see LOTR or harry potter come out on top of one other? of course not. each wanted their own time in the spotlight. but not those greedy whores at sony. so i say, screw spiderman. i'll have no part in helping them make their studio execs any richer. i won't even see it at the dollar theater because that still adds to their final total. maybe i'll rent it, most likely i won't. and yes, this sounds absurd, but come on now, you all know me. i'm a man of principle. sorry rye.  speaking of movies, if anyone has seen Napoleon Dynamite, tell me how it is. i can see it being really funny, or really a waste of my time. my dance game comes tomorrow!!! my mom comes today. i'm watching rainman on my comp at home. yellowcard - finish line is my fav song this week. i'm eating a heath bar. and Six Feet Under is the greatest show known to man. down to the last two episodes of the season 2. and i think i'm strangely in love with claire.     unavailable to you, not even in your wildest dreams. that's why you don't&nbsp;have&nbsp;trouble being honest with me, there's nothing at stake.

      freaking amazing! had another 3 hour Six Feet marathon last night and i had the privilege of seeing the greatest episode of any television show i've ever seen! second season, episode 8 - It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year!!! it was absolute perfection. i can't even describe how good it was. the flash backs, the cross cutting, the freaking amazing&nbsp;storyline, and angles, and soooo much happened in it. felt like i was watching a season/series finale.&nbsp;the moral of this story is to go rent seasons 1 and 2 of Six Feet Under if you have never seen it. then when you get to episode 8 of season 2, you can thank me then for sharing my great wisdom with the world.  yesterday was very productive in my book. drove around an hour looking for best buy up north to buy a brand spankin new microwave that can rock with the best of them. realized this is the first time i think i've ever really purchased a new one. always got hand-me-downs i think. then we picked up&nbsp;a fatty HP printer/scanner/copier. i can't even tell you how pimp it is. had to replace the last one because jonas chewed up an irreplaceable ribbon inside of it. as soon as i can, i'll toss some pics of our new toys on here. we also saw my bose speakers i want for my comp. that will come a little later though. right now we are planning on upgrading the cars soon. fatty rims on some low profiles for kim's new car, and new fosgates in my jeep. can't wait!  speaking of, kim learned to drive a stick shift yesterday. she actually did very well. very proud of her, even though she was a little impatient at times. but it will come. so for everyone who gets stuck behind a black honda that can't make it through the green light, be a little patient. its my wife learning how to drive all over again.  my back still hurts like a biotch, but i'm too scared to see a chiropractor. not that s/he is going to hurt the begeezus out of me, but i would just be nervous. i have to do something though. its getting worse each day and its been going on for a week now. if it gets any worse, its going to start impacting my dance routines, and you know we can't have that!

      yesterday was not worth the post. except i did get Citizen Kane on dvd. can't wait to see it a few more times! we finally picked up our new car. turns out its not a 97 like i thought, but a 96. hey whatever, still pretty tight. i'll be playing driving instructor today. also getting a new microwave and printer hopefully later this afternoon. the above pic is of some monkey in israel that was dying of some kind of cancer i think. they gave it some crazy surgery to keep it alive and ever since its been bipedal and never uses all four legs to get around now. just makes you think a bit right? i've always been a 100% believer in evolution and now i think i'm like 102% now. i'm not going to get into it too much, but its quite the thing to ponder on for a while. man, i'm trying to think of more to write, but i got nothing. just waiting for the slow girls to get there gears rollin so we can head out. despite my optimism, the next two and a half weeks are going to blow. the short rip off time the school gives us off after this summer is going to be so well needed for the law firm. it'll be weird during that time because lets be honest, we probably won't see each other during it. and when school starts up since we have like 1 class together, things just won't be the same. so i think i'm going try and make each day the greatest ever with those guys. pretend like this summer will be the last. to be honest, next to '01 this has been the most fun summer i've ever had. well, i'm getting tired of waiting for them now. usually when the huslin husla e-propa calls, the ladies come a running. maybe i'm losing my skillz cuz it ain't workin this time....=w=

      High Noon (1952): extremely well done. probably the first film that is done in real time. only see it if you are way into movies, and have an open mind of what you're willing to watch. truly suspenseful to the end, gary cooper freaking delivers like nobody's business! however, since everyone except him is freaking horrible, i would have much liked it if he had killed the bad guys, then the whole town at the end. its one of those movies where you really hate everyone. kinda like life  so today sucked. work sucked. didn't get done half of what i wanted to. afterwards wasn't too bad. had lunch with mike and danced at the mall for about 10 minutes. then met up at L's house to study. course that didn't happen. luckily we didn't need it though because we didn't end up having the quiz. just kinda sat around and talked. not sure what happened though. just being over there and listening to L, and thinking about J getting a job and what's gonna happen to her school schedule and the law firm just kinda bummed me out. then class sucked. then leaving sucked. everything really sucked. my alone time at jamba juice wasn't so bad though. but even then i only had 1 person to call, and they were too busy for me also. my alone time at home was nice. got to watch my movie. but then the girls come home and before i know it we are all yelling at each other for who knows what. well, i do know what, but i'll spare the gay details. so now i'm tired and i just&nbsp;want to sleep. not here though. i want to sleep alone to the quiet. have my own bed in my own room. just for tonight though. i can tell this weekend is gonna be really great. i mean, great as in jessica simpson is&nbsp;a great singer. or great like michael jackson would be a great godfather to my first born son. why is it that the days i wear brand new cool shirts and try and look good for once in my life, that the day turns out like this? maybe i should go back to just wearing all my =w= shirts from like 3 years ago. old worn out clothes = good days? nice clean expensive clothes = me whining on the internet. oh well. its never any use.  as for the title of today's happy post, its from Tenacious D and its called Friendship. not sure why, but the line seemed fitting today. don't ask why, its just how i felt as i left school.

      my computer room is being slightly occupied by my sis, so won't be able to write each night when i want to. i bought a pimpin new volcom shirt. its peach! my first peach shirt. but its rad. wearing it right now as a matter of fact. my back is still hurting from lord knows what. when i sleep on my back and right side, all is good in the morning. on my stomach or left side, i feel like going on a rampage because my back hurts so bad. i need to check out a chiropractor, but i'm too damn lazy. speaking of being lazy, if anyone has noticed (most likely not), i haven't been watching movies lately. reason being is i've been busy watching every episode of michael moore's the awful truth. little show that ran 2 seasons a few years back. if anyone has an extra 50 or 60 bones layin around, i suggest you go buy this show on dvd. i found it at media play, but i'm sure you can get it online. the funniest, most provocative show you'll ever see! for those who have been missing my movie reviews (which is probably me alone), never fear. a return shall they make to this here site of sites.  hey everyone, jessie got a job! still unsure of why she quit her original job at the bookstore in the first place, but she's working at Convergy's. for those not hip to the Utah County scene, she is now the newest worker at the only job in town. so all you American Express holders out there, you better start using your card, or you just might get a call from jessie kaye! and sorry guys, that won't turn out to a good thing because the lady is already taken. my recommendations:   never answer the phone ever, unless you know who they are and really want to talk with them  jessie, you can do so much freaking better than this. work there if you must, but try and keep your eye open for anything else (but not a bagger at a grocery store)   took my sis on her first drive yesterday. she actually did very well and got amazing by the end. she does need to learn to drive a 5 speed however. both her and kim do now that we bought that civic. guess what i get to do this saturday with them???  last night had a little Six Feet marathon. i can't even begin to tell you how good this show is. except its not good when the dumb retard coworker sits and tell me everything that happens in every season i haven't seen. dumb ho is starting to piss me off by doing that. gotta run. i can't even tell you how busy i am going to be at work today. lets see, homework, figuring out the schedules of the law firm for the next 6 years, and jess's criminal law hw. i tell you what, i get no respect. i used to do other peep's homework in elementary and middle school so they would protect me from getting made fun of and beat up. now i just do it just because i guess. things sure have changed since i was a kid.

      i wasn't going to post tonight. i'm really tired for some reason. was just going to sleep a long sleep. but then read ryan's entry tonight, and i got a big smile on my face. being content, shouldn't that be everyone's goal in life? i sure would like it. i love being happy for others, and i've never been happier for him. its funny because i'm actually speechless. i really don't know what to say. i don't think my night could get any better, than seeing a friend as happy as he. and yeah, i've felt that way a few times here and there. those connections we have are a rare thing, but when it happens, well, i guess there aren't words to even describe it. these feelings sadly do not last forever, however i think because they become the highlights of our lives, they are worth all the pain in the end when we lose hold of it. basically what i'm saying is, love makes life worth living. its the only thing.  i feel like nothing else i write from this point on tonight will even be worth the time after the above paragraph. however, i do gotta give a shout out to our girl Lyndsie Lee!! she's a freaking star in the class and got the highest grade on the exam! props to her, the hardest working partner of the law firm. my sis is here now. her and kim are watching Maid in Manhattan, which is why i'm in here of course (and also why i want to go to bed). gonna teach her how to drive tomorrow. should be interesting. i just want to say that i still don't write everything i want to in here, and i apologize for that. i don't suppose i ever will be the open book i hoped to become. if i were to really open up, my world would shatter. i feel like i am cheating everyone out though when i write on here, but i know its for the best. i've lost one too many friends in the past, i'd never leave the house if i lost anymore. so i'm sorry for being secretive, but that's just the way its gotta be.  well, girls are going to bed now, so i must as well. good night and sweet dreams to all. tomorrow is another day to find whatever it is we are looking for. i'd tell you what that is for me, but then i'd have to kill you.

      yesterday had some interesting ups and some really interesting downs. &nbsp; UPs: got to talk with my bro for a while on the phone; got a very, very nice compliment from a classmate, although they probably didn't even realize it; started watching Six Feet Under season 2; talked to my mom who is coming out today to drop off my sis for a week; and had a jones.  &nbsp; DOWNs: got a very, very nice compliment from a classmate, although they probably didn't even realize it; cried like a baby at the end of the second episode of Six Feet; woke up with the worst back pain imaginable; realized how disgusting i look; had to freaking deep clean the house last night because "its polite"; had an interesting convo with mike, and am still trying to figure out what i did wrong; and read an interesting post from matt, and am still trying to figure out what went wrong. &nbsp; so i wake up this morning and guess what? you know that 20 pounds i would loooove to just go away??? well its still there. and you know my favoritist black jacket that i've had for years and that i can't find??? well its still gone. then my back still hurts, won't be able to do the 2 o'clock study group because my mom is coming at that time. probably won't be doing the 4:30 study group because i'm sure mike has cancelled it. and probably won't want to go to class tonight. and let me tell you how hungry i am right now. how do people just forget to have dinner? why thank you for asking, because i did last night. i can't even imagine coming home and not eating anything, but as hard as i try, i can't recall ever snagging a bite, except for the jones i had from the store at about midnight. and of course i got no time before work today to do eat. hence we have come full circle to the fact that i am hungry. so, i'd say, all in all, yesterday and the beginning of today have been crap. &nbsp; whatever. the rest of the day i hope goes okay. i mean, it will be really good to see my mom. i get to work on hers and my bro's computer, so that will be fun. i might still get to study later today with the firm, but i won't hold my breath. and sometime maybe i'll eat something. food is good. food is too good. although i must say, i really don't eat that much food. curse you high metabolism freaks who can eat for days and still maintain your little figures!! i'm obviously bitter, but this really isn't a complaint considering i'm not pissing and moaning about it while i'm checking you all out (guys excluded. i just hate all of you.). and as far as school goes, i can already tell its gonna suck bad in the next few weeks. presentation, paper, exams. its going to be soooo overwhelming when its all due. oh well. i'll BS it all as usual, then cry about how i'm not going to get a good grade, then by some miracle, i'll get undeserved&nbsp;A's again. just another semester in the land of me.

      behind 10-19, aka police headquarters, aka my work, is some dude's farm or something. everyday i see this random odd looking blue bird with some really weird head thing going on. he is always there, so i am assuming he lives there. granted, i realize that birds have nests that they live in, but you never think of a bird just living on a farm of some sort (sorry people, but i didn't grow up on a farm). i don't know, it just seems kinda cool to me that it has a domicile (Legl 4150 rules!!). also, as i walked to my jeep after work today, it started to rain pretty hard. as it began to come down, two horses in the field ran together under a tree to stay dry. again, maybe not odd to some, but its fascinating to realize that horses can reason in such a way. they didn't just stumble upon shelter by aimlessly wondering the field in the rain, but they knew to go there because they remembered in the past. its absolutely amazing. the point of the story is, never underestimate our fellow beings of this earth. in fact, most of them are probably smarter than most of us. you don't see them driving around with the parking break on. &nbsp; earlier today i did this quiz that i found on matthew's diary (by the way matt, i'm done reading everything. now freaking update already. its like reading a good book, but without the last chapter). you can find the quiz  urlLink here . The topic is, "what does your birth month say about you?" what does mine say you ask? well i'm glad you did: &nbsp; MARCH: Attractive personality. Sexy.  Affectionate . Shy and reserved.  Secretive .  Naturally honest, generous and sympathetic .  Loves peace and serenity .  Sensitive to others .  Loves to serve others .  Easily angered .  Trustworthy .  Appreciative  and returns kindness.  Observant and assesses others . Revengeful.  Loves to dream and fantasize .  Loves traveling .  Loves attention .  Hasty decisions in choosing partners .  Loves home decors .  Musically talented . Loves special things.  Moody.  &nbsp; insanely, they all really apply believe it or not. you may be skeptical about some, but if you think about it, i really can be generous and sympathetic. i bolded the ones that are just scary because of how right on they are. anyways, thought that was quite coincidental, although interesting. &nbsp; so back to the exam from last week. lets just lay it all out. i won't post scores, just letter grades. mike and i equally got an A, whereas jess got a C+. let me tell you why i suck, as a person to study with. i feel like i could have done so much more to help get her a better grade. i feel like it is both mike and my responsibility to make sure all four of us do as good as we can. i feel like i didn't take this exam as serious as i should have. i feel like i have let both the firm and jess down. i feel like i would rather have gotten a worse grade, and she had gotten a better one that i because she knew freaking everything as we quizzed each other. she deserved what i got, and i deserved to be bummed over my grade. now granted, i've heard from numerous peeps that it isn't my responsibility and that sometimes we just have to accept things that have happened. so sorry if i can't do that. this exam was freaking hard and i have no clue how i was able to do so good. the point of all this is: jess is gonna tell me, "blah blah blah, it wasn't your fault, i should have done more, yada yada yada," but i don't care to hear it. i'm sorry we didn't do more to help you out, i didn't deserve the grade i got, we still have lyndsie to take the exam, so hopefully we can help her out as much as we can, and mike, you are lucky i didn't get 1 more point than you. now that i am writing all this, it seems like most would think this isn't that big&nbsp;a deal, but its something i've been thinking about all weekend and feelin pretty bummed about. &nbsp; oh, and p.s., you guys&nbsp;all freaking missed out on the greatest dance&nbsp;party of the century tonight. i'm not sure where it was or who went, but i'm sure it was great!

      so, i'm back. as many things that went right on the trip went wrong. first off, spent $120 just in random crap needed at target to go camping. didn't think i'd be spending that much. oh well. got off to a good, early start, and i was happy to see that there was no one at the site i wanted. sandwiches were good. rain was not. rain was very not good. as an attempt to not get all my clothes wet, i'm out there with just shorts on (settle down ladies) while buckets were being poured on me as i get the tent up and cover up anything that i feel needs it (which was pretty much everything i had take out of the car). come to find out, i put up the tent wrong. go me! from then on there is basically an on and off again monsoon, complete with lighting probably striking about a half mile from us. then there are the occasional deer legs scattered around the camp site (clueless and disgusted about these. mike, you kill bambi. you have any ideas why they were there?). and the bugs. we all know how much i loooove bugs flying around me. yesterday afternoon and this morning there were&nbsp;so many damned&nbsp;mosquitoes flying around. now we move on to the campfire. i will never, ever in my freaking life buy a stupid piece of crap&nbsp;lighter again. my thumb is raw from trying to hold down the "safety button" to start it up. but that's funny, doesn't look like it wants to work for me. lets just use matches then. oh wait!! why would i bring matches if i have this incredible lighter i just bought? don't worry ethan, we don't need fire. we were only planning on using fire for the lantern, stove, and campfire. so with the ingenuity of kim, and a little teamwork between myself, the stove, POS lighter, and lots of lighter fluid, we were able to get the campfire roarin like a mofo. before we knew it (about an hour later), we were roastin some smorse! and thankfully, it didn't rain as we did it. and all the meals were great too! between me making sandwiches, and mike's special for breakfast, and kim grillin up the burgers for dinner, i think we did alright. all was topped off by up packing up the muddy everything, through the muddy mess, into a filthy car now, and me, cruisin&nbsp;on a beautiful sunday morning, all the way home with the parking break on. can a camping trip get any better? i think not. we still had a blast, and i'm sure it will be even better next time. &nbsp; my mom and sis are coming out this tuesday. well, really its my mom dropping off my sis for a week, then driving back to CO again. should be fun though. maybe teach her how to drive once she's out here. first thing i'll teach her: check the freaking parking break. oh yeah, i'm having a massive dance party at my pad tonight. all are invited!! its going to be insane. we are gonna have the dance game, and uh, me dancing. and its ladies night tonight!!&nbsp;the first 100&nbsp;of Provo/Orem/American Fark/and Nephi's finest ladies in the door get free drinks. we got OJ, milk, and i think 1 can left of C2 Coke!!! so yeah, party starts at about 8 and the nonstop megamix will go until about 12, or until i get tired and go to bed. dress to impress biotch!

      i sometimes feel like i'm not a man yet because i don't get 5 o'clock shadow until usually 2 days have past. this sucks because i want to have that shadow. i actually think most guys look good with it. but it takes 48 freaking hours to get it. and really, i only reap the benefits on the third day because that is when i get to show it off. so by the fourth day i have to shave it, because we all know how great i look with a beard. but by the fourth day, the hair is too freaking long, and gets pulled and twisted through the dull blades of my freaking electric. can't begin to tell you how bad it hurts. and then, after i get home from school, i'll take a look in the mirror again, and go ethan!!! you missed a few spots and you look like some&nbsp;retard who doesn't seem to care about his appearance. in the end, i fail at my attempt to look good and cool, but i get a gold star when it comes to looking like white trash. go me! &nbsp; spent all night packing for the camp trip tomorrow. my freaking jeep is packed to the bone with junk. patti says i won't need it all, i beg to differ. guarantee all shall be used. and looks as though we might buy a honda from our friends. yes folks, we (or kim when she learns to drive a stick!!! and that goes for all of you out there too: matt, karen, tom, ryan. wait, he just doesn't drive very good =) ) are going to become one of the 90% of americans that own a honda civic. not that honda's are bad. they are probably one of the best cars you can buy (counting honda's acura, which i got to say, the new models are the best ever!!!). its just now we are like everyone else. just another car on the road, with no personality. hopefully we'll spruce this one up with some more good ol' fashin bush bashin bumper stickers!! &nbsp; for all my peeps in colorado (which seems to be about three these days: r, t, &amp; k), its looking more and more like i'll be heading out there in august. my prior plans of SF just aren't looking promising. thanks to dtpb for the pic above. i'm paying her a good 60 cents an hour to make them, so more to follow. anyways, i'm gonna be camping tomorrow night, so no update then. during that time you would normally take to read, just think of a good thought. something that truly makes you happy. whether it be a girl, guy, alcohol, song, a stuffed monkey, whatever. just picture it, and be thankful you have it. i'll go first..umm....there, i did it. now you must. for every person who does not do it, i will kill you! muahahahaha!! bye friends.

      first and foremost, i gotta give a shout out to my homie martha stewart. congratulations and i'll be seeing you in 5 months biotch! and mad props to lance in france. one more punk to take down before you bring it home again! go us! now all you gotta do is dump nasty sharyl crow then you'll get an A in my book. so yeah, last 24 hours have been insane. got to bed really late last night, which is completely normal i guess you can say. but since i had to be at work today at 1, i was so hoping to get up early to get some stuff done, or at least to relax and play the dance game. but nope. wake up right at noon, with just enough time for me to get ready and leave. do i even have to tell you how pissed i was? i just want to say, that i appreciate all those who read this every now and then. its a weird thing that people are actually interested in my boring whacked out life. i mean, i sit and read matt's (i'm up to january 2004 finally), and he's got such the busy life doing so much. me? you won't find me living the life. i play the dance game. &nbsp; speaking of matt, a friend and i are now reading the diary together. this person is a little farther behind than i, but its still fun to talk about what we read. its like reading some really dang good fiction (however, its sweet to know that its not, and its about a good friend of mine). for anyone who has waaaay too much time on their hands, again its:  urlLink http://blankwave.diaryland.com/ &nbsp;go to Archive and read about the tragic&nbsp;that is love, the joy that is music, the stress that is dirty roommates, and the drama that is big, nice smelling black guys calling you a&nbsp;faggot on the subway. &nbsp; so, i really want to be honest when i write. i don't want to just BS this diary, just so people will read it and find it interesting. i want to tell my life how it is, with very little secrets, if any at all. so what's coming next may or may not be a shocker to those that know me. yesterday and last night, with a help from a few ladies, i realized that i am depressed. now, i'm not talking, "i'm having such a bad day today," but like i seriously suffer from depression. to some, this sounds ridiculous, but whatever (all you gotta do is look at the majority of my family to see what depression is). i think i'm gonna look into start seeing someone. maybe they can get me on some drugs or snap me out of it. i'm just sick of being sad and mad and bitter every single day of my life. i have such a good life, but i'm never happy. i just want to be happy again. not even sure if i can say "again." this has been going on for so many years. its all that damn Cure i listened to in high school (which has now been replaced by Bright Eyes). i just get sick of living and sick of people and everything in this world. i just want to take some time off from the world. maybe come back when things are a little easier. since that will never happen, i'm forced to see a shrink. too bad the shrink's name won't be jack daniels. anyways, thanks for those that just listen. its probably the only thing that gets me through.

      alright, so does anyone else do this? i walk out the house, and i sometimes wonder if i have my pants on, or am i just wearing my undershirt out, or is my zipper down, or whatever. so i have to look down ever so slightly to make sure, before i get too far into the world where i'm totally screwed if per chance something like that did happen. maybe its just me. anyways, more about this little diary. i'm not sure what to do. for those that might be offended or whatever, the only thing i can say is to please don't read it. i won't be hurt, nor will i care at all. all will be good for me and whoever doesn't want to read it, if they just refrain from doing so. so we had our midterm today for probates and estates. i did extremely well surprisingly. actually, like most my grades, i don't think i deserved what i got. lot of them were just plain lucky guesses, and also consider the fact that i didn't participate much in our study groups or care too much either. i just wanted to play the dance game. i'm not gonna post what i got until all of us in the firm has our grades. and by the way, the exam did suck bad. i could go on about each complaint we had, but it would take up too much. just trust me on this one. the high was a 42/50, low was in the 20's. crap man, i don't even want to talk on here now. i'm sick of getting reamed for what i write. i would just start over a new page and not tell half of you, but i don't want to lose what i already have. whatever. and oh yeah, i'm back at work for the second time today covering some girl because she's go some blood problems going on in places where blood shouldn't be coming out...well, i guess it is supposed to come out there, but not this time. this is bad blood. bad blood coming out of bad place. so she can't be here, and i'm too freaking nice to say no. now i'm gonna have to buy all my camping crap tomorrow night, and that's even if i&nbsp;get to go still. okay, i think i'm done writing. i'm dozing off to sleep. gonna take a nap. doubt the cops that are working tonight will even leave their sqaudroom to do anything. goodnight all.

      i love leaving the house seeing the streets empty. hell, doesn't even have to be completely empty. just nice seeing road for once instead of bumpers. like tom cruise in vanilla sky, its kinda refreshing (however he was not refreshed, he kinda flipped his lid). and please, someone tell me what is the point of radio anymore? all the same trash, played on 5 different stations. i swear i hope radio becomes obsolete some day. and finally, holy hell do i feel and look fat today. i'm becoming this sick blob that can't even look at himself. but i do figure that the majority of guys become overweight as they get older, i guess i'm just starting a little early. well actually, i think i started back in '81, but who is counting? maybe the dance game will help shed a few hundred pounds here and there. and finally again, can we please find some kind of cure for headaches? now i'm not talking some over priced chalky pills that take effect maybe after 3 doses in a 12 hour period. i want real damn fast acting relief. there has got to be something out there. so if anyone knows any drugs, legal or otherwise that does the job, drop me a line please. and lastly x 3, i have my first real exam later today for my probates class. let me tell you how much i don't care to take it. and oh yeah, if you are from church, and you need to get a hold of me,  STOP CALLING, I WILL NOT ANSWER THE PHONE, I WILL NOT RETURN YOUR CALLS, YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME, LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE BECAUSE I AM BUSY DANCING!  on that note, time to get my daily fix the serban  urlLink http://blankwave.diaryland.com/ .

      so i'm sitting here in my boxers, drenched in sweat. its not a pretty sight, but its the price you gotta pay for being a master at the dance game.  however , i must stress that my teacher and master jedi jessie, is still by far better than me overall. and likely, contrary to what she will say, i will always be her little padawan dance guy learner. i may have beat her 1 or 2 times today, but she can rock my socks off any day of the week. anyways, i've really been thinking about this whole online diary, and i'm wondering if its pointless. i mean, it sucks because there are so many things on my mind that i want to talk about, but i could never say because of some of the peeps who might read this. i might cause such a ruckus if certain people knew what i did and especially what i thought. so, i'm sorry mike and jess, but i'm not gonna be able to say everything i want to say. i wish it weren't like that and i just didn't give a crap, but sadly i do (or maybe, thankfully i do). today was a good day though, despite my ranting and raving after class. its just that...ahhhh! see, i can't say things. this whole thing is pointless if i can't say what i want to say. lets just say that some (undeserving if you ask me) are luckier than others. i guess i'm just a jealous fool. on to a new subject because i'm being so incredibly vague right now that i'm just gonna be asked by everyone what i'm talking about (and now that i've said that, everyone who wasn't planning on asking will now ask). so, the more i'm in carolyn's class, the more i think she is a tad attractive. like today. while the rest of the class was teaching as she sat on her ass, er, i mean, butt (sorry jessie), she sat next to me and she wasn't the dogface that i usually see. granted she still has a ghetto booty, but that's okay. might have been my beer goggles though. just kidding folks! well, today's been fun, kim is supportive (as supportive as can be i guess given the circumstances), jessie laughs like a hyena, mike makes a freaking mean breakfast, lyndsie is, uh, umm...lyndsie is hot, patti doesn't seem to like to write me back,  urlLink matthew  is still a freaking star in my book, carolyn is slowing becoming not the most annoying person in the world (awkward phrasing), and as for me, well, i'm still ethan. still confused about everything, always wanting the grass somewhere else. i don't suppose i'll ever change.  but as for me i'm coming to my final failure i've killed myself with changes trying to make it better but i still ended up becoming something other than what i had planned to be

      ok, there is a movie coming out called Before Sunset. the prequel that came out a few years ago is called Before Sunrise. two peeps met in the first movie, 9 years go by without seeing each other, then the second movie they run into each other again, and basically chat it up about what could have been. this my friends, is the story of my life, so i can't wait to see it. i mean, think of the all the different roads i've taken (all of us for that matter). there are infinite possibilities that could be my life right now. the reason i bring all this back up again is because of matt's diary. when i read it, its almost like i'm there and doing it all with him. granted, it was more like "he was a big bro that i idolized, and i was just the little bro falling him around," but what if he and i had gotten closer? ya know, maybe after patti, i just dump it all and head to ny with him? however, then i would wonder about the future and where i was going in life, and i'd probably be writing these exact words in some pad in ny. but you never know. sucks that we don't know if we've made the right decisions or not. you figure, if i had gone, jessie would be sitting at home not doing homework tomorrow, mike would be sitting at home working and not doing homework, and lyndsie would be sleeping until she works (like homework is even an option for that girl). i don't know, i'm just yacking away. no matter what road is taken, things i'm sure will turn out. but at times, some roads seem better than others. as forever and always, oh well. by the way, i'm a retard. guess i didn't get the memo on the lynds. her bro already got married this last weekend. umm, yeah, not really sure why she is going to vegas this coming. maybe reception? hell i don't know. didn't want to say anything cuz i'd look like a total retard in front of her. okay, everyone who can download music, (which should be everyone this day and age) and who isn't scared of the RIAA nazis, needs to download The Starting Line - Classic Jazz. i believe there is only a live version out there, so get it and please, rock out as hard as you can! tomorrow, lets dance, put on your dancing shoes and dance the blues people!!!

      shit man, i'm here at work now, and i've got sooo much damn homework to do, but i've been reading my boy's diary online for the past hour. it is so freaking interesting that i'm starting from the beginning (jan 2003), and determined reading everything. i've got so much i want to say about my once close friend matthew in nyc, but for now, lets just say that i miss him more than even i know. now on to Chapter 7: Final Draft and Execution of a Valid Will. you know that turns you on!!

      The Notebook (2004): not the tear jerker i was hoping for. kinda flat in the middle. but its a really good story and has an amazing ending. acting is very good, as are the locations, production design, and all that jazz. only see if you absolutely love romantic drama-type movies.  got my dance on today. trying to plan a camping trip this weekend. most likely it will fall through as stuff like that usually does. trying to get it all planned out with the firm for this week cuz we gots a midterm on thursday. so wednesday we're meeting at my place 10:(30), having breakfast, doing the dance game, studying, doing the dance game, eating lunch, doing the dance game, then class at 6. should be a good day, although this does mean me getting up before noon and cleaning the freaking house. getting a little frustrated cuz our lil lyndsie is taking this whole adult responsibility, lets get a job thing, a little too serious. poor girl works about 90 hours this week, has her bro's wedding over the weekend, then comes back next week to work another 80 hours. luckily we get to study with her on thursday (if all goes well) for the midterm. that's bout it. i'm ready for this week to be over with. i'm ready for this summer to end, actually, i want classes to end. i want a summer where i can just hang out with my peeps. i can't even imagine what that would be like. where did my summer vacations go? k, i'm gone. i can't stand carolyn (however i might be up for some extra credit if she offers it), all music from kill bill, GTA3, and Vice City rawks, and today gainesville, fl was a high of 89, low of 72, with isolated thunderstorms. not too shabby i'd say.

      Chinatown (1974): nicholson is stellar, but the movie just plain sucks. as hard as i tried i couldn't get into it. the story was lame and it just dragged. didn't understand the majority of what was going on, but the thing is, i didn't care. i counted down for the ending to come. don't see it, and forget i even mentioned that i saw this movie.

      granted, not everything sucks, but a vast majority of it does. my anonymous friend's life is subjective, as is mine through this person's eyes. i'm not in this person's head during the times when nothing is being said but the thoughts that occupy it. neither are you in mine. we all expect different things out of life because of our upbringings. whatever happened to you during your first couple decades of life was dramatically different than mine. maybe because of how you were brought up, you are perfectly content with your days, however i am not. i'm always looking for more than day in and day out, and i'm amazed when i find it, however rare it is. and by no means am i ungrateful for the things i have. i do have it much better than most, but i guess its just that spark that is missing. anyways, i'm glad your life is so good that a complaint here and there doesn't seem to escape you. sometimes we build up so much bad/sad/negative crap that we will explode because we never let it out. well, i think it helps me to let it out, so if its a crime for me to open up and complain about life, then oh well. if you don't like it, don't read the posts. moving on since that took up the majority of what i'll be writing tonight, i saw fahrenheit 9/11. how do you say, BEST PICTURE AT THE OSCARS?!?!? unbelievable. now, all my conservative friends need to come out and see this movie. didn't even have to drag kim out. she went very willing and i think now she is set on not voting on the village idiot again for re-election. either way, the movie is great. shed many tears and laughed a ton. warning though, lots of info to take in. if you have trouble watching cnn for more than 5 minutes, this is not for you. a must buy when it comes out on dvd. attempted to go dancing today at the mall, but some freak of nature people were there and were dancing like they've been doing it their whole goth, trench coat mafian life. lyndsie asked me a few weeks ago if i cry when i listen to my music. the answer is no, however, yesterday was an exception. i was listening to gladys knight and the pips' song 'midnight train to georgia' and i really got teary-eyed. when is someone gonna sing that song to me? it was so perfect. basically my life in an metaphoric nutshell (not that the nutshell is metaphoric, that's obvious, but the song was metaphoric. was this explanation necessary?) well, i'm gone. remember, the left is right, the right is wrong, and the world is his, his and hers alone (someday).

      such a freaking bad day. getting better though. started with some whore of a driver flipping me off for absolutely no reason. the only thing i can think of was that it was some bitter conservative seeing my bumper sticker, stooping to the only level it seems they can these days. then work sucked. had mad criminal law hw. i'm getting nagging in my ear from all directions. i'm getting sick of church peeps clawin down my back for this and that. i'm just about done with that. i need a vacation. saw The R.M. today. i'm so against these retard mormon movies, but it had its funny moments. the second half of the movie just dragged because they used up all their jokes in the first 30 minutes. obviously don't see if you aren't knowledgeable about this dumb culture, but might barely be worth seeing if you have sadly been a part of the utah gayness. props to jess for being the first to attempt to break the lines into the legal world. she doesn't want anyone to know just in case it doesn't happen, but she's trying to get on with a law firm (a real one unlike ours, ours is more like the mickey mouse club with lots of drama). work again tomorrow. which is actually good cuz i can get lots of school stuff done. the used is playing at my school tomorrow. luckily i dont work during that. met one of jessie's sisters today. can't remember her name since jess was in the office for a whole 15 seconds, but it was nice meeting her. i think we all need to play a little barry white and just dance. think how better off the world would be after that. oh, and by the way if anyone cares, i think my dad just fell of the face of the earth...again. can't seem to get a hold of him. these days and weeks are starting to mean very little. i can list the crap that i have to look forward to just this weekend, but i'll spare you. lets just say, its gonna suck.

      what a long day. work sucked. so busy with arrests and sending people to the hospital and training and homework and bosses. i hate when i actually have to work. then had to roll up to school to drop one class, just to add another. mike and i got rid of the online class that we weren't really doing. but turns out we get to take criminal law again. well, i guess you can say we are jessie's tutors for the class. well, i guess you can say we are telling her what to do for the class. well, i guess you can say we are doing the class for her. well, i guess you can say that i'm doing the class by myself now. not complaining though. actually enjoying it...again. so i've been working on that all night and will prolly do the same tomorrow to get this done for her. you see, she decided to challenge us and start the class that normally takes 15 weeks to complete, with only like 5 weeks to go. karen is back in CO. good to have her safe and sound; home from the crazy europeans. if you happen to be rollin through boulder and see a fresh, silver jeep cherokee, with a skinny white dude in it, that would be my boy tommy cruisin in his new whip. pimp tom pimp! so yeah, been thinking about planet of the apes (the original of course) and wondering if i would want to jump a few thousand years (or maybe 20) into the future like taylor does. basically i'm saying, i can't wait to see how it all turns out. the firm, school, fam, friends, music, jobs, church, bratty kids, all that shiz. i want to bring up the topic of death and all that, but then everyone and their mom will start asking me questions about it all, so i'll just leave it alone. maybe another day. always another day. this was a rather point post i feel. oh well. night friends

      can't wait to buy the dance game so i can sweat like a pig in the privacy of my own home. and i won't have creepy old guys hangin at the arcade watching me. so yeah, woke up at noon and spent the afternoon doing that with my sis-in-law. today was her b-day so that was cool. then went out to dinner with them and off to class. let me tell you why carolyn sucks as a teacher. now, our guest speaker that she used today because she doesn't want to actually teach the class was pretty cool. she on the other hand must have missed school the day they taught where the states are in the U.S. oh but wait, she's been "all over the world" so i guess she has no excuse to know that colorado is not southeast of utah and that arizona is next to cali, not new mexico. i shouldn't make fun of her though. after all, she is a big time fed lawyer now. i mean, writing memos is very difficult. anyways, i hate that class. i'm going crazy with my classes. not sure if i'm gonna make it through the summer. oh well. i do have to say, i thoroughly enjoyed talking with jess and mikey today. those kids always make me laugh and it was so nice to kinda get to know more about jessie kaye. funny cuz you think that we're all so different people who have so little in common, but come to learn that we are alike in more ways than i can even imagine. tomorrow we get to get that girl through her criminal law class. should be fun i think. people, we all need to open up more and be frank. lets all tell each other what we think or if we are having problems with someone. sometimes (well, most of the time) i feel like peeps are pissed at me. how do i know if they don't tell me? so here is my request to one and all, talk to me if you are pissed ok? we are all adults. thats all i have to say on that matter. k, got work tomorrow morning, nighty night children.

      wow, just got back from dance lessons at lyndsie's. most spontaneous thing the firm has done yet. after taking a freaking terrible quiz, we figured we should intrude upon lyndsie's apartment and neighbors and dance the night away while stuffing our faces with pizza. lets see, mike is getting good, jessie was rockin the house on doubles, and then lyndsie...ah yes, miss lyndsie. she was quite the feisty one tonight. i think she just couldn't control herself over my moves. hey ya know, it happens. i'm used to it. =) the rest of the day was kinda just the usual. work sucked, studying blew, was being moody during the firm's study time, and i was falling asleep in class. oh well. i'm so looking forward to being able to sleep in tomorrow until like noon. haven't decided if i'm gonna head to the mall to dance. i'm sure i'll see how sore i am tomorrow. well, time for a nice shower or bath, still haven't decided which. i'll just wing it. hey, it got me an 18/20 on today's quiz!!!

      guess i didn't miss the hot air balloons after all. so woke up nice and early to go shooting with mike. man did we have fun. the place we went was so nice...probably only the third beautiful thing i've seen in utah. we had a blast though. between the clay pigeons that just kept getting away and the bugs attacking me, won't soon forget this little outing. and yes, mike saved me multiple time from bugs that were like 6 inches long. they were, i promise!! had tons and tons of deep convos though which were fun. and mike, remember, bro's over hoe's k? after heading home, and he and i getting nothing accomplished in terms of homework, it was off to the mall to get my daily fix of pump it up! i'm getting good, i think. hard to tell though. need the "pro" to square off against so i can see how good i'm getting. soon it'll be off to bed cuz the real week starts tomorrow. work, then homework, then studying, then quizzes, then repeat. on and on. by the way, i think karen hates me again. she hasn't emailed me back in a while. well its okay, cuz i don't hate you. finally, just gotta give a shout out to my mom...love you. i'm out.

      so yeah, didn't quite make it up in the morning. maybe next year i'll get up before noon. had quite the talk with lyndsie lohan. found out that she is not down with lunch. that sucks cuz i'll tell you what, lunch rules!!! she doesn't know what she is missing. =) and oh yeah, spent a little bling at the arcade yesterday on my new favorite thing. i'm gonna be the best dancer on that dance machine which i don't know the name of and can't think of a clever sentence to write. betta watch out jessie katsopolis! i'm becoming proficient in the beethoven and vivoldi ones. and yes, the swing baby song is awesome. except i was doing it on easy, but its still fun. and oh yes, dodgeball. saw that yesterday and despite the fact that some contend my taste in movies plain suck, i thought it was hilarious! the cameos by everyone and their mom in this movie made it awesome. my only complaint is the stupid bi-sexual joke at the end. it could have been funny, but they just didn't play it out right. anyways, its not a classic comedy, but definitely a must see! so quit your crying melchior, i liked it. =) lastly we headed out to the usual fireworks spot. i've seen better fireworks when i shoot my .22, but it was fun cuz mike and all his ancestors dating back a thousand years were there. i hope i didn't embarrass him in front of everyone when i took him down. sorry if i did, but you know what happens when you mess with the madness of e propa!!! biotch! you would have loved to have seen it jess. hey, i heard some disturbing news about mr. roy coon. anyone wanna back this up? k, i'm out at work now, gotta start watching movies...=\/\/=

      well, another crappy friday come and go. worked most of the day, in fact i'm still here. writing this in between the officers pulling over everyone and their mom tonight. tomorrow is utah's 4th of july since this year's 4th falls on a sunday. hopefully gonna wake up and take some early morning pics of the festivities. we'll see though. mornings and ethan usually means trouble. got my tv back today. thank you L. we've all got so much homework its rediculous. i feel bad cuz most of the reading for all of the classes suck pretty bad and we are falling behind kinda fast. talking to my sis today about growing up, finding that one special person, so on and so forth. the girl is so young and has so many years ahead. i hope she realizes that and makes the best of what she's got. i look back and wonder where it all went. now don't get me wrong, not complaining (too much) about life now. but these days i try so hard to stay young and keep those years, however it seems to be to no avail. man, i'm quite the complainer. could be worse, i could be brando right now. sad day by the way. STELLLLLAAAA!!! anyone else see that movie besides me? please tell me yes. actually, you get a gold star if anyone has seen more than 1 of his movies...or can you even name more than 1 of his movies?? come on, anyone? do you even know who i'm talking about? maybe tom could, but i'm sure he could care less about reading any of this. man, you guys are missin out on great flicks. i'm out, everyone in utah have a great 3rd of july. i'll be lighting up on the 4th (no jessie, not that kind of lighting up)

      holy cow that dance machine is fun. such the workout. i'll be buyin this as soon as i can. even got the missionaries in on it with elder brazilian professional dancer showin us all up. and how could we even go to class after all that? but we did and i barely made it through without falling asleep. last night was another restless night, totaling about 3 hours of full sleep. but then something happened after class that neither i or mike could explain, so don't expect anything juicy as you read on, cuz we don't know what it really was. we both just kinda felt something, unsatisfaction maybe? your guess is as good as mine. we just didn't leave the day thinking, "man this was the best day of our lives." maybe it was elder brazil stealing all our play, who knows? not sure if we've ever felt satisfied after a law firm meeting. i'm just rambling and have no idea where i'm going with this. and geez, okay, all guys listen up. don't ever offer your manly tv to a girl who is alone with her teeny tiny tv so that she can watch movies or whatever. sure, its a nice gesture, but it will just backfire causing stress levels to rise and embarrassment to set in. so don't worry fabulous fowkes, i'll be prolly picking that up soon. and finally, kim's sister is coming to town. i'm all for it, but i'm just so tired and it also means my computer room is basically gone for a week. grrr. oh well, i'm sure we'll have fun. point for jessie for the fun day. point for mike for being mike. minus one point from lyndsie for not accepting kind offers and doubting my mad computer skillz, but two points for her for putting up with my wacky antics...tally it all up and the results.....i'm losing! hey! what do you know?

      kind of an odd day. got stood up in glenwood. guess rhett and jess had to go golfing. i'm not mad because its their trip, but i was just sooooo looking forward to it. actually found out about it like 5 minutes before getting into town. but made it to denver in like 7 hours, which was like record time. then headed to joe's for some quality brutha time. hung out at his place for a few hours, was on the phone with dell folks from india for hours. freaking retards obviously don't know anything about computers and are too retarded to even read the screen telling them what to do. so they are going to have to send out a new comp to J now. then we headed to dave and busters to get my dance on. had a really good time with him. i wish we were closer and all. guess he and i always had a lot of just bad timing. now i'm at mom's place chillin here. turns out she is buying that house in utah, or at least making the attempt. right now her and kim are talking on the phone right now about the whole situation. not sure that kim wants her living out in the middle of nowhere. i love denver. downtown is so nice and the weather here is perfect. the mountains were beautiful and actually had trees on it, not like utah's wannabe mountains. not sure what i'm gonna do tomorrow. just relax i imagine. joe told me such a funny joke today at dinner. he probably doesn't even remember what it was, but i can't wait to use it. well, gotta talk to my mom for a bit. later

      Up in Smoke Concert (2000): fo sheezy this was an insane concert! freaking unbelievable. i've never seen a concert here in the U.S. where every person is so into the show. the songs they played were off the hook (now i'm just being dumb). there is nothing like seeing snoop with a freaking 18 inch revolver and dre with a desert eagle blastin some guy. some of the songs are proof that they can't sing very well, however the entertainment value was tight. caution, its very unedited, and most of my peeps don't like rap. but its worth seeing just for the glimpse of when gangsta rap was at one of its primes. see it.  its finally over with. probably one of the hardest classes i've ever taken. we studied as much as we could, which sadly wasn't very much. mike and lyndsie studied i think a ton more than jess and i, which is prolly why they did so much better than us. you gotta do what you gotta do i guess. in the end, i'll barely get an A- if that. and if the stars are aligned just right for me, i'll pull an A. even wrote an extra credit paper in 20 minutes after class with the hopes he'll accept it late. oh well. now the terrible waiting begins for the grades to be posted.  now we just look on to next semester. i hope it can be freaking normal. i don't know what the deal is with some folks having issues with me. what the hell do i do to make peeps feel weird? i'm around you's guys for like 15 minutes out of the day and all of a sudden we all got problems with me. oh well i guess.  755 pictures, 4 photo albums, about 50 trips to costco, 1 year, and about $150.00 later, i'm finally done with tom's photo albums. pictures since 1998 through like 2 month ago. little jerk better be grateful for all this hard work. knowing him he'll prolly take them to his parent's house and put them in the basement. i can't stop laughing right now. i'm at work and had like 3 officers and my boss in here right now and were all making fun of me as they usually do.  so i'm leaving tomorrow early. way early. packin tonight. hopefully gonna watch two more ep's of sopranos after kim's work party, then i'm gone. i'll hopefully be updating this as much as possible while i'm there, so don't fret my pets. i need you and you need me like man needs woman and woman needs marriage...1 day.

      today is gonna be such a long day. not as long as yesterday however. jessie, mike, and emily were over at my place for what seemed like 12 hours doing j's crim law stuff and studying for today's final. luckily we finished her exams and freaking rampaged them up! tack on another A for the group!! woohoo! probates will be a different story though. there is so much to know and i don't think i've opened the book to read in a few weeks. strange because that's really not like me. usually i'm the type to read textbooks cover to cover. anyway, we have a study guide thanks to em and mike, and we are hooking up today at 2 to begin a 4 hour marathon of learning about gay trusts that everyone should have in life, but no one does. but this is it. everything has been leading up to today. last class, hardest class, last day law firm will be in a class together, jess hopefully leaves for CO, i breath a sigh of relief, mike and i wait impatiently for our grades to be posted, emily can put the focus back on catherine zeta jones rather than school, and i start packing for 2/3's of my band TLC (Tastes Like Chicken for all of those not down with the scene) two city U.S. tour.  by the way, t-money and i will be rollin in a convertible eclipse while cruisin cali. can you just picture it now? close your eyes for a sec and picture it. you're not doing it are you? jerk.  good luck to patti today on her final in her comp class. she's gonna need it. kim is going to NYC with her work on september 9th. not sure if i'm going or not, but we'll see. stay tuned for updates, all my certain friends living there. getting down to the wire now for work to be over with and me to get a jamba juice for lunch. its all about freaking peenya kowlada, no boost, add strawberries baby!! did you guys know that a chocolate moo'd there has 720 calories and a peanut butter moo'd has 880? that's freaking insane. not like my kowlada is much less or that i actually count calories, but still. there is also 6 billion carbohydrates in them too! but its nice to treat myself to one every now and then. or every week, or few days. hey, i'm sure its much better than wendy's everyday. or 5 cent hotdogs at the schnitzel. in fact, lets take a gander shall we?  Wienerschnitzel - all beef mustard dog: 350 calories, 20 grams of fat, 30 grams of carbs, multiplied by 4 @ 50 cents each every monday, equals a cheap way to die by age 30.  Wendy's - caesar side salad, w/ croutons and dressing: 290 calories, 23 grams of fat, 12 grams of carbs equals a tasty, semi nutritious way to waste money when you could be making a salad at home. jr bacon cheeseburger: 380 calories, 19 grams of fat, 34 grams of carbs  AND  spicy chicken sandwich add cheese: 650 calories, 29 grams of fat, 59 grams of carbs, equal the reason why i am a fat ass.  so there you have it folks, my science fair project proving that we gluttonous americans will soon reverse the trend of longer life expectancy. once we run out of oil to get us anywhere in our cars, we won't be able to drive to wendy's anymore, thereby forcing us to eat at home, but we don't know how to cook anything, so we'll all starve ourselves, and set human civilization back a few thousand years. i'm so looking forward to it.  The events depicted in this science project are fictitious. Any similarity to any person living or dead is merely coincidental...2 days.

      From Here to Eternity (1953): bordering between not seeing it and worth seeing. i'd much rather watch this than Pearl Harbor. very cool seeing real footage of the attack too. like Pearl Harbor though, they try and throw some made up love story in the mix of everything, but at least i felt it was a little more personal and a connection was felt with the actors. frank sinatra did an awesome job in it and deserves his oscar for it. the ending again was no good though. i'm starting to think that movies then just don't end happily. today we as an audience simply demand a happy, all loose ends tied up kind of ending. it also had an amazing fight scene in it. rivals any movie next to fight club. my advice would probably be to not see it.  okay, the bad news first. i'm really tired. got to bed at 4 in the morning and woke up today at about 9. when i go out to denver, i'm going to see my mom and fam for only like 3 days now. i'm probably not going to see karen or ryan at all. won't be able to spend much time with my bro unless he comes over to mom's place. kim is still kinda mad at me for making this decision. and i still have lots of homework and studying before tomorrow's last day. and i'm hungry.  the good news. tomorrow is the last day for school. 3 more days until i leave. i'm flying to san francisco with tom on tuesday morning and coming back saturday just before my flight leaves back to utah. i'm going to eat lunch soon. and i cleaned the kitchen. yea for me!  now before everyone gets all upset over me going to SF, put yourself in my shoes. we're getting an awesome deal to go, so which one of you wouldn't go? as a lot of you may know, its my favorite city in the world and i would live there in a heartbeat if i had the chance. but i haven't been back there since before i moved to colorado. so in the end, it really sucks that i can't see everyone and be there in colorado longer, but there is no way i can pass this up. so i'm really sorry. as for now, i'm going to watch the matrix 2 and eat some lunch. i guess i could be studying and doing hw, but finals week wouldn't be the same if i were actually prepared...3 days.

      man did we get lucky with carolyn. we originally had a paper due on the day of the final exam. then we convinced her to make the paper take the place of the final because "we are soooo stressed out with school." then we convinced her to have no paper due at all unless we want extra credit. so basically, no paper, no exam, easy A. i hate to earn my grades like that, but hey, i'll take them anyway i can get them. wouldn't you? i'm still going to turn in my paper that i worked so not hard on. this way i'll have like 120% in the class instead of the 110% i already have.  someone stole a tractor from campus last night. thought that was pretty funny. not sure who steals tractors for a living, but we all gotta make our money somehow.  so here is the current checklist for the remainder of the semester:   chapter 15 for jessie's crim law class  midterm and exam for same class  exam for probates  probate paper   and that's it. then i got work on friday, some meeting here at work during my shift, a party at kim's work, then early saturday i'm out the door. then comes the daunting task of choosing who i'm gonna hang out with while i'm there. i really should see lots of my mom, but she lives sooo far away from everything. i mean, i love seeing her, but its such a pain to drive all the way out there to spend the day with her, then all the way back to westy/boulder for the night. then i want to see ryan because i always want to see him. but he is usually too busy doing this and that and his girl. then there's karen, but its hard because i have to hang with her without ryan. then my bro who i want to hook up with for a day or so. then there is tom. i could hang with tom for like days straight and not get sick of that boy. plus he is taking that whole week off from work while i'm out there. i don't know. just wish i was out there longer.  i finally got Heat on dvd yesterday. i cannot wait to see it again. i'm telling you all, if you haven't seen it, the movie man is telling you to put that on the top of your list and freaking see it already. you should already have seen every de niro and pacino movie ever made, but combine the two and you have a freaking blockbuster saga. for 2 points, name the other movie that has them both in it. can't wait for work to be over with. i need a freaking nap. and today is like the first weekday we've had in weeks where we don't have a study group. i love these guys to death, but its been so long since i could take a nice nap in my icebox of an apartment.  shoot man, i gotta send out some stupid attempt to locate message to all the agencies for this dumb tractor. i don't even know how to do it. i hate this job...4 days.

      Vertigo (1958): just another typical hitchcock movie i think. maybe a little more well done. the story was great and was capped with so many twists and turns. jimmy stewart was as old and ugly, but did his part as good as ever. like any of hitch's movies, it dragged at numerous points, despite the fact that those moments were greatly needed. the point is, hitchcock's movie was so greatly thought out and the editing done was near perfection. most peeps who read this would have a hard time ever sitting through a movie like this, although i challenge each to attempt it because it is worth seeing once in a lifetime. my only complaint is the last scene and the way it ended. i just don't get it. its one of those endings when you are like, "that's it?!?! well that's gay!"  work sucked today. the school's power was shut off, meaning the internet was down for most of my shift, making for a long and boring one. luckily i had my movie though. was gonna finish up my paper too, but couldn't do that. so i had kim do some work today on the paper. yeah, i know. pretty low to have your significant other do your homework (although its certainly not the first time), but its not like i can't do it, its just its more convenient for her to do a little here and there. i'm still the one getting the grades. she's not taking the tests or actually writing the papers, well this time at least. anyways, it sounds like i'm sitting here trying to convince you all and myself that i'm not guilty of anything wrong, but i know i'm not guilty of anything bad. i had her do my works cited page, which is as arbitrary as making my cover sheet.  so i've been watching the sopranos every night and i've come to the conclusion that james gandolfini is a really, really good looking guy. well, at least for an older guy. kim doesn't seem to agree with me. i just am glad because that means there might be hope for a fatty like me when i'm older, to be somewhat tolerable to look at.  lastly i want to comment on american idol. yes, i watched all of last season. all the ups and down, including fantasia stealing the win from the lovely diana. i just want to say, where is fantasia now? i thought she was supposed to be famous by now? where is her record and number one single? its nowhere, which is where it belongs. she sucks and diana was robbed. diana would have been the next overplayed crappy radio pop singer had she won. diana had all the right elements for a pop star: young, white, cute, southern, has lots of potential improvements to blossom into a slut. what did fantasia have? when was the last time we had a big pop star that was black? we're talking like whitney houston (mariah carey is NOT black). i guess there is miss bootylicious beyonce, but anyways, you all get my point. tomorrow starts my last week...6 days.

      The Haunted Mansion (2003): not good. i can't remember who told me this movie was funny. i mean, its probably entertaining for a 10 year old, but i think i'd rather rewatch retarded spring breakers in cancun again. the movie focused so much on recreating the ride, that it forgot a little something called acting and storyline. i've never really like any of eddie murphy's movies anyway. at best, i'd say rent this movie for your kids, while you leave the house to do something else. it doesn't matter what, just something. or better yet, just go to disneyland and do the ride. i'd pay the overpriced ticket to disneyland, just to not see this movie.  we drove down to Eureka today. yeah, i didn't know there was a Eureka in Utah either. my mom is checking out places to retire to, so she had us do the dirty work. sad little town i have to say. scary to say, but i'd rather her live in Nephi than this place. GO JUAB HIGH!! speaking of high schools, Juab High school is made up of 97% white kids. i just checked my old high school in california, and us crackers make up 28%. crazy ain't it? back to the Eureka thing, the house had potential, but as my mom loves getting herself into, it is a fixer-upper. well its crazy late, so i'm off. right in the middle of watching a freaking great concert on my comp. probably finish tomorrow night and the review will follow. i can already say, you are all gonna have to see it. fo sheezy biotch.

      The Village (2004): first of all, people need to quit crying about how scary they thought this movie was going to be. Night's movie are not per se, scary, but are suspense thrillers. who really thinks the sixth sense or signs was ridiculously scary? no one!!!! so don't freaking get disappointed and walk out the theater saying, "man, i thought it was going to be scarier and not some drama." second, i read critics complaining that they could see the surprise ending coming a mile away, which actually, i saw as well about half way though. however, i didn't know it was really how it would turn out. i just thought, "wouldn't it be funny if they all......" sorry, but i won't give anything away. i was a little skeptical about casting phoenix again, but it played it out perfect. judy greer was beautiful and just scary good!! and their chemistry together was to die for (did i just say that?). there are also so many looong shots done on a single take which was very impressive. all in all, the movie was excellent, and another typical shyamalan movie, meaning it was freaking rad. he has got about a good imagination as lucas, with the freaking mad camera skills as speilburg. so the critics can go to hell on this one. buy it.  when i got married, the city of denver and mayor webb were so kind enough to give kim and i a few things. lets see, we got samples of downy fabric softener, deodorant, laundry detergent, gum, and coupons for each. despite the fact that they spared no expense on us as a gift from the great city of denver, what they should have given us is the marriage rulebook. i know its gotta exist somewhere out there. or maybe its just a sort of common law that doesn't really exist on paper. either way, i need rules to refer to in every given situation of marriage because i think i'm clueless when it comes to doing the right thing. also, if we got it then, people could read it and realize that those are the rules that you are binding to by getting married. lot less marriages then, leading to a lot less divorces, and i'm ooooookay with that.

      what craziness dream will do to a person. they aren't even real, yet we just have to tell people about them when a cool one happens (and usually sounds retarded to the person hearing about it), or we try our ever so hardest to remember the ones that seem to fade more and more the longer we are awake. we even try and hold on to those amazing ones by fooling ourselves into staying in bed and getting back to sleep. are our lives that lackluster that we live for some imaginary movie that we have no control over. understand that i'm not knocking dreams because i live for them as well. its just interesting that granted most of us will never go on a shooting rampage with a fatty sniper rifle, killing all the baddies and winning the girl, there is beauty surrounding us at every turn and myriad events that go on in a lifetime, yet we still get excited for the most random things while we sleep. we need to realize that our lives will never be a movie, not even a direct to dvd movie. at best, we are the extras in the background, walking around, with no place to go.  the reason i bring all these mumblings up is because i had the strangest dream last night. the dream had my mom, me, kristianne from school, and some other random peeps that i can't remember now. i know it was a very good dream, but i can't remember specifics. however, i've been thinking about it all morning, trying to force my awful memory to work, but its not.  on a few worse notes, its been heat wave central here the last few days. cloudy, but really hot. i miss all that rain we had been getting so much of. and i'm sitting here at work knowing that i have to pull a paper out of my butt before i leave tonight. i hate things right now. so much pressure to go along with so much procrastination.

      Napoleon Dynamite (2004): unbelievably funny! funniest movie of the year so far. i couldn't even believe it. i went to a 2 o'clock showing, and the theater was packed! normally i'm not the biggest fan of comedies, or seeing a movie on the advice of friends (this is the first movie ever i've seen because someone suggested i see it), or anything having to do with Mtv (except Mtv2 of course). so many things impressed me about this movie. it ended on i think the most perfect song for the movie. most movies fail to even get close with that aspect. i loved how the high schoolers in the movie, actually looked like high schoolers. i see absolutely no reason why Jon Heder should not be nominated for a best actor academy award. if nothing else, a golden globe. name any other freaking actor who could have pulled off that performance. the only thing i questioned was the year it was set in. the movie hinted so much that it was the early 80's, however, i swear the design they had going was more like the early, early 90's. but then there were the chat rooms and stuff. i think there were just a lot of continuity problems, but i forgive them on that one. they had to make the story work. anyone have a definite answer on that? my final thought on the movie: see it in theaters, get the word out that this is one of the funniest movies ever, then buy it on dvd. oh yeah, and the chick in the movie that goes between pedro and napoleon reminds me so much of an old ex-girlfriend some of you might remember, oh yeah, the lovely mykal.  so, for those wondering if i got my paper done at work today, i'm sure you all know the answer to that. work sucked by the way, as always. at least i don't have to pull a 12 hour shift tomorrow. prolly catch another movie tomorrow night. speaking of movies again, i saw the worst trashy movie trailers ever. some part two of baby geniuses or something. and a new hillary duff movie. lately she's become the busiest garbage actress since my ex j-Lo (except for Out of Sight). and what? you guys didn't know her and i were together? oh yeah, it was before she got famous. we still keep in touch. but the point is, for the most part i hate cartoons, but A Shark's Tale actually looks really really good. the freaking cast for the movie is amazing (except angelina jolie who i think sucks as an actress). anyways, i haven't decided, but i think i might be up for seeing that.  one week from today, it'll all be over with. lynds said that the firm's last time together will be then, so we'll prolly all go out for dinner that night. is that really true? mike hasn't decided yet if he'll be in Family Law with all of us. that would be our only opportunity for all four to be together. its a sad realization, but i don't see it being completely over with. we still have tons of classes here and there with each other. it gonna be harder than we think to escape one another.  next time you go driving during a busy time on the road, look at all the people just sitting in their cars. ponder for a second about the fact that every one of them has the same amount of problems, friends, family, past experiences, and you freaking name it, as you do. then think about how many people there are in the world, or even at a freaking cemetery. at one point in time, some girl was going through the craziest week in her life deciding whether or not she should marry some guy. her every waking moment revolved around this thing. now she is dead in the ground somewhere, and that week where her life was upside-down, means absolutely nothing. now, i'm not trying to be some depressing oddball here. even though i believe in an afterlife, i'm just saying sometimes i feel that we as humans are pretty meaningless in the grand scheme of things. do secret handshakes and movies like Heat really mean anything? sure they are fun now, and life seems all worth it seeing val kilmer get out of his camero with the grandest smile on his face because he is going to the woman he loves after stopping his life of crime, but the beautiful ashely judd moves her finger ever so the slightest so signal to him that he needs to keep going, instantly crushing his heart in a way that every human being can relate. in a hundred years though, i'll be in some cemetery in cali or colo, and no one on the planet will have a clue about what i'm talking about (not like anyone knows what i'm talking about anyways). the point is, we are as insignificant as a speck of sand or a star in the sky...9 days

      i hate the fact i can't sleep anymore. i mean, it was truly the only thing i think i was really good at. now i fail at that every freaking night. i toss and turn and think about the same crap. then during my short intervals of sleep that i can get, i dream about the same stuff i think about, which wakes me up. anyways, its a vicious cycle that i can't seem to escape. jessie told me of some root or seeds or plant thing that will help with the sleep, but like i can remember what its called. and even after i get it, what the crap do i do with it? put it in a brownie mix? i'll have to get back with her on that one.  i cannot wait for school to be over. we are so dang close, but at the same time, getting so far behind. we've missed the last two days of study groups, so we got a lot of catching up to do. today i'll be tackling the paper for my berrrockrasee class. i mean, i say i'm going to do it, but i can see it now. i'll finish this post here at work, kinda look around on the internet, just kinda chill a bit, maybe fall asleep. listen to tunes, and before i know it, it'll be quittin time. so, i guess i should say, i hope i can even get around to starting it. on a lighter note, jessie and i are perfecting our skills in that class in the art of "name that lyric." from your favorite thugg gangsta's to the sweetest rockin out there, we sure know how to pass the time in carolyn's class. plus, all three of us owned her freaking midterm. each got over 100% with her lamo extra credit. you all get a high five from me! come on, put em up biotches.  if my cat were human, he would be one of  those  people. you know, the type to wake up everyday before sunrise, make his little coffee, read the paper, maybe catch some news, not that he has to be at work or school so early, but for no freakin reason at all. every morning before work i wake up at 5:45, and as sure as my bad looks, he is up with me just kinda following me around. i'm on the computer, he's on my lap. i'm in the bathroom, he's drinking the water from the sink. i don't know what his deal is, but he's got some whack sleep schedule. i'm sure it has a lot to do with the fact that like most cats, he sleeps about 22 hours out of the day. but i gotta mention, kim stepped on his paw with her shoes on last night. poor thing hollered like, well, like things that holler. it was funny though. and she complains i abuse the cat? nice try.  well, i was planning on bringing up the topic of "being a guy, being a friend to a girl, and people bitching about it," but i think its pretty self explanatory. there are some people in the world who are guys, who may have friends that are girls, and sometimes ever so often, people unnecessarily bitch about it. its fine to joke, but lets not cry about it okay? now, no one take this the wrong way because its not directed to anyone in particular. i can just already see fresh brewed crap in the future. so now you know, and knowing is half the battle....nice catch blanco nino!  okay, its about time for me to not write a paper. out.   these are my thoughts written down on paper, it's my only savior, from not saying what I want to say, these are the thoughts that are on my mind, moments that haven't yet been defined, and I don't know if you could ever understand, these are the things I can't say when were alone.

      The Real Cancun (2003): still haven't figured out why i decided to even watch this. the only way i made it through the movie was by pretending it was a cancun video given out by a travel agency (i actually really want to go to cancun now). i honestly got bored at exactly 12 minutes, 20 seconds. it got to a point where it didn't matter what anyone was even saying. and the nerd guy that the story seemed to center around was a gimp. who is a retard enough to complain that he can't get girls, then literally, and i mean literally run away from them when they are trying to jump your bones. who's does something like that? the only good that came out of it was the two black guys in it were really funny and seeing snoop dogg perform was sweet as always. naked chicks it had, but if you want some t & a, get on kazaa. don't see it.  I, Robot (2004): take Demolition Man, A.I., and any Will Smith movie and you have: I, Robot. the special effects had some very spectacular moments, however, there were also parts that seemed a bit comical. not sure if they ran out of money or were just being too optimistic. extremely entertaining and had plenty of twists. and i gotta say, Will Smith is amazing. there are very few movies he's made that have sucked. the guy knows how to freaking deliver. lastly, i must comment on the robots. i never liked them from first seeing them on the trailer. they are too "un-robot" looking, whatever that means. the point is, i still don't like them.  so, today again had its ups and downs. was supposed to have a law firm meeting at my place. yeah right, that fell through. however, everyone had a legitimate excuse. mike had to earn his money up in SLC, and jess had a bad day at work. luckily that little feisty girl got back at her dumb trainer. we got some extra credit in class today just for being there. can't complain with that. well, jessie can since she was sleeping at home.  as briefly mentioned to patti earlier today, i realized how lucky i am to have friends still left from high school. it is so nice to be able to go back home to the same people i've known for years now, and pretend like nothing ever changed. i can't say that i know anyone today besides us, who are still friends with old high school peeps, and that goes for california and utah friends. i just wanted to say i guess that its pretty cool. nothing works yet on my computer still. its a big piece of crap if you ask me. well, better get to bed. another study group tomorrow at my place (if anyone bothers to show up)...11 days.

      This is Spinal Tap (1984): definitely had its funny moments, however i'd be more entertained watching Love Fist from Vice City. i must say it was bold of them to make this film. i imagine most moviegoers would simply not get it. its just too strange of a movie to make. if 80's rock and 80's movies are your thing, see it. for everyone else except ryan, go waste your money on spiderman and shrek a few more times. losers.  i'm not sure what happened yesterday. getting sick of these half days. the first half usually starts out pretty dang good. then the second part comes around and it all turns to shit.  first half: woke up before 11!! i was so proud of myself because i could actually get things done that i needed to. jacked around (that's " around " jessie) for a while, then took off to costco. picked up some blank cd's, lunch meat stuff, breakfast stuff, fabric softener stuff, and dropped of my film stuff. then had a most scrumptious lunch at Quizno's. finally, off to home where my new video card awaited me. the day was looking mighty swell. then i jam to school to prepare our presentations with my group, and as always, had a blast with them.  shit half: sometime during our little meeting, it hit me that i'm going to have to get up in front of everyone and present some stupid chapter out of the book because our mental case teacher is too lazy to teach the class herself. anyways, i loathe more than anything, getting up in front of peeps for this crap. then the teacher's dad, who's a judge (how do you think she made it to law school??) comes strollin in because it happens to be his day also to teach the class. like jessie and i weren't nervous enough without her dad, who i'm not sure if i mentioned is a judge. so i panic, but think it won't be so bad. i was somewhat prepared, well, prepared enough to BS my way through it. thankfully though, we didn't have to worry about her dad, who is a judge. after teaching his part of the class, he took off. so blah blah blah, cutting to the chase, i get up there and totally lose it. i was shaking so bad and completely lost all train of thought. i looked like a complete idiot trying to figure out what i was even talking about. there was this horrid awkward silence that lasted like 10 seconds where i couldn't talk. i was so close to just walking out the class and not coming back till the final was given next week. i don't think i've ever been so humiliated in my life (well i have, and if you've been around tom ever, i'm sure you've heard the story a million times). i wish i could even begin to truly describe how i felt, but no words would even cut it. so i sat down, wanted to die, and listened as jessie rocked the house. i can't believe how freaking good she did. she sounded so professional, like she knew what she was talking about, and didn't screw up on a single word (even those really hard ones like consciousness and hierarchy). i swear after she was done, i couldn't have been more proud. then mike got up there and freaking showed everyone up again. and he gets extra props because he didn't even have time to rehearse any of it. oh well. just tack on another experience that i'll fail miserably in trying to forget for the rest of my life.  so i'm home to a video card i know will not work for my dance game, given the nature of the night so far. and sure enough, it didn't. i worked on it for so long yesterday, but i can't figure out what the problem is. i don't know what to do about it except just give up and just accept the fact i've spent hundreds of dollars on nothing. i felt and still feel so helpless. then our friends bring over their crying kid so they could go out to see a movie. kim is sure the trooper for watching him. this 2 year old cried for it seemed like an hour straight because he wanted to go home. could you blame him though? i wouldn't want to be around me either. so i go to sleep with crying in the other room, crying in mine, waking up every hour because one of the few joys in my life (sleep) is something i can't even do now, then of course the power shuts off for some reason during the night. so when i'm excited that i have 3 more hours of sleep when i see the clock, i realize its not 3 am, but 6:30, and i have 15 minutes to get ready and leave. cool huh? and the house looks like a dump today, but i got my group coming over at 2. life just couldn't get any better.  such is the familiar bad day. oddly enough, i prayed for the first time in a long time yesterday. the prayer wasn't even for me, but was for someone else. felt weird doing it and i'm not sure what made me. just thought they could use the help. looks like ryan and miss danielle are shacking up together. even though i didn't find out about this from him, i'm really happy for them. i know they will have a blast!  today i'm still in the same chipper mood as i was last night. sorry friends, but i'm not sure if this will go away anytime soon. just know that its got nothing to do with you. its just these half days kill me...11 days, please come quicker!

      Gone With the Wind (1939): yes, i sat through all 4 hours of this movie, and i am glad i did. the movie is amazing. long yes, but it goes by at a good pace. vivien leigh gave a performance that i don't think any actress alive today could recreate. my only single complaint is that the score would play during random times of dialogue. i'm sure it was fine for its time, but is never done today. however there is so much good i can say about this movie that i wouldn't even know where to start. just buy it.  so that's basically what i've been doing at work since this morning at 7. well, that and sleep. i should consider myself lucky that i have a job that is so uneventful, i can sleep for three hours in my chair, then watch a four hour movie, and now i am writing this. last night i didn't get to see a movie. got stuck helping our friends move into their new place at 11 o'clock at night. who does that?? anyways, that sucked. but we did get to see the first episode of the sopranos. i thought it was pretty good, but it was confusing (as confusing as any mobster movie i've seen because 1. too many people to remember; 2. always hard to keep up with what everyone is doing; and 3. can't understand them because of their accents). i wasn't impressed, however of course i'll give it a chance and watch the next 3 episodes and see how i feel then. i'm sure i'll start getting into it as the story develops. but it just didn't hook me like Six Feet did the first time i saw that. we'll see. i'll keep you informed.  i'm slowly working my way towards seeing a doctor. today we figured out what our insurance will cover, and which doc's i can see. i don't care who i go to...as long as its a guy (however i wouldn't flat out reject a woman), and they aren't LDS. i imagine i'll start seeing someone at the start of the semester. props to jessie for her bit of patience. her and rhett finally got a home to themselves now. hope they have fun with my dance game!!! grrrr.  anyways, the cops i work with are funny. they have tons of cop war stories and they think that everyone else's way is wrong except for their own. hate to see what they would be like in a real emergency situation where their lives are on the line. okay, i got nothing now. i'm still so tired and want to get these next two weeks over with and go back home. J and R might be going to colorado the same day i do. it would be sweet to finally meet R and follow them or something. either way, i'm countin the days...13 to go. for now, i'm gonna watch the freaking insane storm heading our way. hopefully it will blow me out of this state and away from school
