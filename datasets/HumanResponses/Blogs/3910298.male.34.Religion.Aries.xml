						   Welcome to my weblog!  It's pretty exciting!!!  Thought I would start a little online journal while I am searching for jobs and God's direction for my life .  Here's a copy of the email I sent out in May about my situation...  kind of a flashback weblog entry...  -----Original Message----- From: Peter  Sent: Tuesday, May 11, 2004 Subject: moving on...  Friends - As some of you probably know by now, my last day at William Jewell College is May 31.  I have been praying about this decision for some time, and only until recently have received much affirmation from God and others that I was where I was supposed to be.  Only in the last month I began to see that it might be a possibility - and in the last couple weeks God made it clear that it’s time to move on.  While the timing of this is a bit unexpected, I believe that God led me to WJC, and he will lead me on.  He has great plans for us all. And during this transition time for me, I greatly appreciate your prayers as I seek God’s fresh direction.  Future plans?  Not sure yet, but I still want to do campus ministry somewhere.  I love working with college students, and I feel that I have been gifted to do so.  I will miss the students and staff at William Jewell very much, but as I said, through it all, I have sensed God’s presence and direction.  I truly believe that God led me here in 1997, and he affirmed that by giving so much fruit to this ministry.  And now I believe he will lead me elsewhere - so I am not alone in this at all.  At the same time, if you know of any leads, please let me know!  Well, that’s the long story short…  I’m happy to share more if you like - just drop me a line.

As I have often found in traveling in a stagecoach, that it is often a comfort to change one's position, and be bruised in a new place.&quot;        - Washington Irving        &nbsp;        &quot;He who rejects change is the architect of decay. The only human institution which rejects progress is the cemetery.&quot;        - Harold Wilson        &nbsp;        &quot;Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation.&quot;        - Robert F.

						   Just finished watching  urlLink Gladiator  with Jesse, Jake, and Mike.  Wow - can you believe I've never seen it?!  OK - so June went by SO FAST and I still don't have a job. ;)  I posted my resume at several Christian ministry job sites, and I got my first email today - asking me if I was interested in a youth/worship minister position in Ontario.  Yes, Canada.  That's pretty exciting.  What an adventure.  ...Which is why guys like movies like Gladiator - the adventure, the battle... living life and dying for something you believe in.  May I live my life that way, even in this transition time.  Ready to die daily for my Savior.  Jerry Voll described Jesus' life like this on  urlLink Bruderhof.com ...  Jesus lived his life an adventure - with purpose every day.  Might I do the same?  Might we all?   "As God’s son, Jesus was at the same time flesh and blood. He was real God and real man. When Jesus walked this earth with his disciples he related to them as man to man. They were brothers, some even by blood. This physical relationship extended to all the people with whom Jesus had contact. The multitudes had come to know God as a real person. He worked with them, ate with them, talked with them, challenged them, instructed them, partied with them, trusted them, loved them, died for them, rose for them."

						   So... like so many before me, I start a weblog, and then leave it be.  I had grandiose ideas about getting on here every day or so and typing up my thoughts through this process.  WELL, I'm over a month into this thing.  Not much written yet, but to tell you the truth, it's taken a bit of time to process this process, or whatever it is.  In any case, I'm ready to write about one of the more recurring themes from the last month...   Faith .  I spent the early part of June hurrying to get my resume out and check out every possible lead in the nation.  There were like three jobs out there, and I didn't get any of them.  And then someone told me to slow down and enjoy this 'process' - to not miss out on what God might want to teach me through this ordeal.  So the latter part of June, while exhausting even more leads and checking out every single college in Kansas and Missouri, I realized that I wasn't going to find something right away - that I was going to have to wait on God.  I should keep looking, but really trust that God will open the door when it's God's time.  And he knows what's best for me - his timing is perfect.  That's the test, really.  Will I 'faith' God to bring me safely to the next thing?  Will I trust him to show me where and what it is?  I feel peace about it as July begins.  Ask me in a few months ;)    READING:   urlLink Wild At Heart , by John Eldridge

						                                 Well, it&#8217;s time for my monthly ;) update&#8230;        Still praying and looking.&nbsp; Not much else has changed.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve started selling stuff on eBay, and that has been fun!&nbsp; I now have a UPS account :).&nbsp; Feel free to check out my online stuff at  urlLink http://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewSellersOtherItems&amp;userid=rockpeter .

That is our first task and our greatest challenge.&nbsp; I must admit that I know all too well the rushing of thoughts and plans at the start of the day.&nbsp; I am learning (again) to quiet my soul and give God my waking thoughts&#8230; and try to be open to what HE has planned for my day.
