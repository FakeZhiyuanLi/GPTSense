      :sigh: Ever try to get utilities turned on at your new house? If not, it sucks. Plus, for the record, people who work at power and light companies are on weird little power trips. Most of them, anyway.  For those who requested it, here's where you can find a picture of my new puppy: http://www.geocities.com/photography/luna.jpg (copy and paste into your location bar)  Later!

      Well, I did it. As if I weren't a tool of the internet enough, I had to go and start a blog. Good for me. Now you can read this and pretend to be halfway interested in the life of someone you've probably never met. Whee!

         You represent... hope. You're quite a daydreamer and can be a hopeless romantic.   You enjoy being creative and don't mind being alone at times.   You have goals, and know what you want in life... even if they are a little far fetched.   urlLink   What feeling do you represent?    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Amazing how one can become so suddenly inspired. For whatever reason. I pulled out the photo albums of my trips to Central America in 1993 and 1994 and started organizing them into scrapbooks. I'm feeling creative and accomplished right now, I must say!  This is it for the year. See you in 2004!

      Andy's uncle Doug Mullens lost his battle with cancer today. We were expecting this, but nowhere near this soon. He was a fun, awesome human being-- very educated and talented. He lived the best part of hippie culture and always strove to embrace and understand his fellow man. He loved music-- The Grateful Dead, The Beatles, and such. He was well read and enjoyed The Far Side and Calvin & Hobbes.  Doug had a family that loved him and he loved back. He was twice a grandfather, and had a best friend and soulmate in his wife Jeanean. We'll really miss him.

         urlLink          Another Christmas come and gone. I'll miss it. I love having an excuse to buy presents for people. I love surprising people. And Andy seemed plenty surprised by the Martin Backpacker guitar I got him (since his mom said he's been talking about getting one since he was 16). My parents surprised me with an AWESOME digital camera! Yay! I don't have to borrow their old, outdated one anymore! :)  All in all, things are great! I was all smiles when I went to bed on December 25th.  But, for every up, there's a down. Andy decided a couple of months ago we couldn't make it to Walt Disney World for our annual New Years' trip, since he'd used up almost all of his vacation time. So, I decided not to go without him, because a) it wouldn't be as fun without him, and b) who would take care of him, the house, the dog, etc? Besides, it'll mean a little more time together before I go back to school full-time.  And then he and his band got booked to play New Years' Eve. And they're practicing during all of Andy's free time. So, I'll most likely be sitting at home by myself when midnight strikes. I get the feeling that the band doesn't really like me to be around-- sort of a Yoko Ono kind of thing. Looks like it's just me and the dogs (my Luna and mom & dad's Diva) that night.  Then, THEN, the night before my family leaves for WCW, he mentions that I should have gone with them, that he'd be fine on his own. Well, too late now, now that I've gone ahead and scheduled doctors' appointments, let prescriptions run out, put off paperwork, and didn't get any money out of the bank. Oh well.  So, I'm bummed. I'm happy in the grand scheme of things, but I'm super-bummed. But the puppies like me. :)

      Ok, a cute little Christmas story for you all...  At my sister's school, they have a Korean exchange student named Yoo Young. She's in band with my sister and her gang, and she hangs out with them, as they are all charmed by her incredible cuteness. Anyway...she asked my sister if Santa would be at the band's Christmas concert. Well, we've had the same guy play Santa for the Christmas concert for years now, so Haylee said yes. " Real   Santa?" she asked. Turns out that in Korea, Santa is seen as a symbol of goodwill, but they know that in America, he's the bringer of gifts and so on, so she was really excited about the prospect of meeting the actual Santa Claus.  So, Haylee spread the word around not to ruin this for her, since she still believes in Santa (and it would crush anyone to learn the truth when they're thousands of miles away from home). And when Santa came out to greet the crowd at the end of the concert, her face absolutely lit up. And, since she was too nervous to talk to Santa by herself, Dad took the liberty of introducing him to her (she trusts Dad, since he's her director and all). She sat on his lap, he ho-ho-ho'd for her, and she walked away absolutely glowing. It was such a sweet and fun moment. Here's a pic I snapped of the two of them...  (Pic coming as soon as I can find where my mother put the bloody disk!)

      I'm still pissed about Roy Disney having to resign. Talk about the end of an era! His resignation letter was a masterpiece though. My question is, since Mickey Mouse himself is 75 years old this year, are they going to ask him to resign as well?

      Ok, I'm sitting here in my NEW HOUSE (finally got moved in and everything!) watching "The Simple Life" on Fox. You know, the one where Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie go to live on an Arkansas farm. And I thought it'd be only right to dispell a few myths about my home state...  1) We do not all live in the country. Granted, we don't have HUGE cities like L.A. or New York, but we do have towns and cities. 2) We do not all live on farms. In fact, in the 26 years I've lived here, I've never milked a cow. I never even saw a live chicken until I was 17. 3) We are not all uneducated. Granted, there's a lot of ignorant white trash here, but we've got a whole lot of college grads here. 4) We actually wear shoes. It's acceptable to go barefoot at home in the summer, though. 5) We don't hang out at Wal-Mart all the time. We will, however, go there if there's absolutely NOTHING else to do. And we do stuff like  urlLink this .  There. Felt good to get that out of my system!

Others are drawn to your peaceful, nurturing nature.           Find out your color at Quiz Me!                It's cold still. Bleh.  Auditions were last night. For more info, check out my other journal,  urlLink backstage with the diva  (also located in the links list on the right).  Fridays are both good and bad. Good, because I have plenty of time to get some homework done before the weekend, and because I only have to carry one book around all day for the one class I have that meets on Friday. Bad, because between Chapel and my sole Friday class, I have over 4 hours of nothing, which can get "dumb and bowing" (thank you, Homestar!).   I've got a little work to do over the weekend. Andy'll be practicing with his band, so I've got plenty of quiet time to get it done. I have my first test of the semester to study for (Christian Home, all fill in the blank, no multiple choice), and some experiments I have to get done for Vocal Performance. I have to dust and wash my bedding, go on vocal rest, and adjust the humidity and hydration in my house to see how it affects my voice. Then I have to write a paper about it. Oh, and I have to memorize three pages from  A Streetcar Named Desire  using my directing notes, so I can perform the scene with a random partner for Contemp. Drama.  The dog is driving us crazy. She's going through another chewing phase, and she's destroying our possessions. Andy's taken to smacking her on the butt and tossing her outside. Good thing, because I'm too softhearted to do it.  Oh, and everyone go to  urlLink Save Disney . The link's on the link list as well.  I'm off to the library to do research on  Merchant of Venice . The fun never stops.

      Yay! I can check a few other things off my list of stuff to do! That's the good news. Bad news is, it's time to pay bills AND my prescriptions have run out. Yeesh, that's a lot of money.  Random thoughs running through my head at the moment: -- It's cold. I hate being cold. -- I wonder what soup they have in the student center today? -- I should probably do more work. -- I have to remember to go to the library before class. -- Is there a quiz in Christian Home today? Better not be. -- Must read chapters 8-10 for theater history. -- Need to call Stephanie, need to call Stephanie... -- How much longer until they announce what musical they're doing next semester?  No wonder I'm dizzy all the time.  Anybody out there watching American Idol? What's your favorite audition so far? As far as the bad singers go, I think "Scat Girl" is hilarious. She's the one who tried to sing "Route 66". For the good singers, I loved the pink-haird girl who sang "Rescue Me," the crooner who sang "The Way You Look Tonight" (that voice made me drool!), and the 50's-style girl from San Francisco who sang "Almost Like Being In Love."  Ok, lunchtime, then off to Play Production. Wonder when my script for that is getting here?

      Sheesh! I take a weekend off and everybody goes and writes a buncha posts in their journals. Makin' me look like a slacker, y'all are...  Anyway, by Friday night, I finished all but a few things on the list. I still haven't gotten my one-act proposal ready, and I haven't written a paper on  Tartuffe  yet. Oh, and I still need to print out a new resume. Other than that, I got a lot of work done. Yay for me.  So, on Sunday, I come dragging into church, grubby dress, old sweater, ratty hair, feeling gross (because I still don't have a working shower, so I have to shower at Mom and Dad's), and no makeup, and Mom says, "It's time to do something with you." So, we go to the mall, where I get my hair whacked off to shoulder length with layers (which looks great!), and she treats me to 3 new sweaters, 2 new shirts, 2 new pairs of pants, and a pair of boots. I have to admit, I look and feel a lot better.  Well, gotta go eat before Shakespeare class tonight.

        urlLink     I have the wings of the  Phoenix .   Gotta meet with the bank today. Bleh. Sat down with Dad, and figured out that it must be the bank's mistake, because we've never written a check we didn't have money to cover. Ever. Thankfully, Dad's friends with the bank pres, so he said he'll meet with us personally this afternoon.  Classes are pretty good, and I'm at least remembering people's names. I've got a list of things I have to do this weekend, if I'm going to stay on top of things...  1) Read  A Midsummer Night's Dream  and finish the handout about it. 2) Find theater journal articles about  The Merchant of Venice  3) Write my "Qualities of a Good Mate" essay for Christian Home 4) Choose 2 sample theater job opening advertisements for Contemp. Drama 5) Form outline for Contemp Drama final project (got it approved!) 6) Research  Six Characters In Search of an Author  for a paper and presentation 7) Read  Tartuffe  and write a 2 page summary 8) Choose topic for Theater History final paper 9) Type script for one-act project 10) Turn in one-act proposal 11) Reconfigure resume before auditions on Thursday 12) Research 1940's New Orleans and create sources list 13) Do script analysis for   A Streetcar Named Desire   In other words, I got a lot to do in the next three or four days. Thankfully, I only have one class today, and it doesn't meet until 2:00, so I can get some of this done by then. Unless I keep screwing around on the internet...  Yeesh. Better get moving.

      Things are teh suck today. Mainly because, despite my meticulous bookkeeping, the bank says we're overdrawn. I've gone over everything a billion times and don't see AT ALL how that could have happened. ::sigh:: Andy'll flip when he hears about this. Money matters depress him big time. Plus, at some point last night, my dog chewed a hole about the size of a golf ball in my blanket on my bed. ::grrrr::  Other than that, I guess everything's ok. There's a cute little 2 year old girl in the computer lab right now that's cracking me up.  ::sigh again:: So tired, too. No idea why. I've been getting plenty of sleep. I guess my body just hasn't adjusted to the changes yet.  In other news, anybody wach the State of the Union address last night? What a laugh. Of course, in my family, we turn it into our own little version of Mystery Science Theater 3000. It's fun. But the fact that Bush is trying to convince us that "employment is on the rise"? Or that "the economy is stable and getting better"? Whatever!  Only Amercan Idol made me laugh more. There's some reeeeeeally bad talent out there.

      Well, here I am in the computer lab, getting a jump start on a week's worth of homework. I wish I had a life.  I've decided to hold off on finalizing topics for a couple of classes until we have an actual class, not just the "here's the syllabus, and by the way, you're doing a final project that'll turn your brain to oatmeal" session. But I've got options at this point, which is good. I chose an oral interp project, since we're supposed to bring something to read in front of the class tomorrow. I decided on the lyrics to  Ana Ng  by  urlLink They Might Be Giants . A lot of their works are real poetry. Plus, I fell in love with the line "When I was driving once, I saw this painted on a bridge/ "I don't want the world, I just want your half." the first time I heard it.  And I think I'm going to do my semester-long study for Play Production on Tennessee William's  The Glass Menagerie . I'm more than familiar with the show and the set and prop requirements, so that should help a lot. And for my stage management credit, I think I'm going to ask this girl Lindsey if I can stage manage her show,  The Boys Next Door , which she's directing for her senior project. She seemed rather excited at the prospect of having a stage manager handle all the logistics so she can concentrate on directing.  I get the feeling that most of my tech tine this week is going to be spent rearranging and reorganizing the workshop and costume shop. ::sigh:: I want something to paint! :) And perhaps this will be the year I finally learn to use a drill!

         urlLink       ::sigh:: Fridays are teh suck. I show up for chapel at 9, then I have NOTHING until 2:00. No car either. So, here I am in the computer lab, getting a head start on final projects (yes, the first fweaking week of the semester) like the uber-nerd I am.  And now...it's  Heather Quote Time!   I must toot my own horn here and say that I've spouted a few zingers this week. Mainly out of nervousness, which I combat with sarcasm. Anyway, here's a few memorable ones...  "Her bitchiness was like a cancer that started in her nipples and slowly made their way up into her brain." (Describing a former colleague of Andy's and mine.)  "I really missed you today. I saw a VW and had to hit myself." (To Andy, my constant "slug-bug" companion)  "You know, some mornings, you're walking along, and the air is fresh, and you're sipping spiced tea, and you just have to smile and wonder to yourself,  Where the heck am I anyway ?"  Have a good day.

      Well, things seem to be going ok so far, but every now and then, I wonder just what I've gotten myself into. My teachers tell me not to worry, that they know I'll do just fine. We'll see...  Homework already! I've finished some of it as of right now, mainly because it involved internet research, and I was screwing around on the computer anyway. I'm so tired though, because my body does NOT want to keep getting up in the morning. Plus, I hurt everywhere from trucking all over campus with a huge bag o' books. I'm hoping I'll learn to adjust. Thankfully, all three of my classes today are in the same classroom. That's right. Not just in the same building, but in the same freaking ROOM! But, most of the theater majors are in the same boat as I am, so I see the same people all day. Kind of comforting, actually.  Met a girl named Katie today who treated me to lunch. She reminds me of me at her age (did I just say that??), except that she has a boyfriend and I was a boy-repeller for many years. Ok, maybe not, but dating was not high on my agenda. Actually, she reminds me a lot of Stephanie at that age too. Anyway, she took the same professor I have for Christian Home last semester and she says the course mainly turned out to be like sex ed. She said I should have no problem passing, being already married and all. :)  Question-- why do professors have to tell you about the freaking huge final project you'll eventually have to complete on the first day of class? My brain's about to explode just thinking about the various papers and presentations due by May.  Still, so far, so good.

      Last night was fun. Steph showed up at my house around nine, and we went out for coffee until the coffeehouse closed at midnight. Then I kinda tossed for an hour or so before drifting off. Dad woke me up at 6 this morning, calling to tell me he was proud of me. Never got back to sleep after that.  So it's 11:00 now. So far, I've been to Chapel (I'm getting too old for that long walk up to the upper balcony),  and bought books (I charged them to the business office, so when my financial aid finally comes through, they'll take it out of there). And good God, if there's not a kajillion pounds worth of books there. I had to lug them down to the checkout area of the bookstore in a cardboard box, and bought a messenger bag (acid green!) just so I had something to lug them around in today. Yeesh.  First class starts in 2 hours. Afterwards, I have 10 minutes to hike alllll the way across campus to get to my next class.  So far, so good, I guess.

      Well, tomorrow's the big day. Meep. I've gotten my pipeline account fixed, and I'm all registered, but still no word on my financial aid, which is bad because it's supposed to pay for my books, which I don't have yet.  In other news, Stephanie's coming to visit! She's in town because she has to pick up her sister at the airport and deliver her here to start classes tomorrow. So, we're meeting tonight around dinnertime. Yay!  There's no way I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight. :P

      Well, the countdown is on. I'm so nervous-- I start classes on Wednesday. As of today, my financial aid still hasn't ironed itself out, I don't have books, and my campus pipeline account was suspended for "security reasons." ::huge sigh::  In the meantime, answer me this... (stolen from DGP's LJ)  1. A movie. 2. A book. 3. A musical artist, song, or album. 4. An LJ user not on my friends list. (Or a blog I should read) 5.

        urlLink      Well, I may as well admit it-- I'm nervous about going back to college. First of all, I'll be older than most people there, so what if that naturally keeps people away? I mean, I'll already have the stigma of being a "drama geek" attached to me, which alienates me from a lot of people, but what if the fact that I'm older and married has the same effect? Will I have to wander around alone with no friends? Will I be that girl that has to eat lunch by herself while studying because nobody wants to go near her?  Plus, what if my financial aid keeps screwing up? Will I even be able to start classes with everyone? Will it be awkward, starting halfway through the year, seeing as how most people have been together since the fall? What if I've forgotten how to study?  I'm freaked. :(

         Congratulations! You're Legolas!    urlLink   Which Lord of the Rings character and personality problem are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Well, I've done it. I registered for classes. It's a weird schedule with one night class (since it's the only time it's offered) and huge gaps between some classes (oh, DARN! You mean I have to hang out in the computer lab?). Here's the lowdown...  * Christian Home (for my required Bible) * Shakespeare (towards my English minor) * Contemporary Drama * Theater History 2 * Play Production * Vocal Performance  And, of course, chapel every morning. Now I have to register my address with the housing office, get a chapel seat, choose an advisor, apply for entrance into the college of education,and-- oh yeah, see why my federal financial aid hasn't come through yet, since they won't let me into classes until they get my $2500 down payment. Apparently, everything got tossed out when I didn't start in the fall, despite the fact that I wrote SPRING 2004 as my entrance date. Yeesh.  So much to do, so little time. Gotta get it done before classes start next week.  My quote of the moment: "You think I don't have feelings? Well, you're wrong! I'm an ACTRESS!

      I'm having an awful day today. First of all, Andy's been in a bad mood with me since yesterday, which sucks and makes me dislike being married. I feel like such a burden. Second, I'm having to babysit Diva (my mom's dog) while they're in Florida (where I desperately wanted to go but couldn't because we thought Andy would have to work, and it turned out he didn't) and she's so depressed about not having Mom around that she's peeing all over my house. Then, when I was getting laundry together to take to Mom and Dad's house, I tripped and spilled it all over the back of the truck. Then while I was re-gathering it, I managed to sprain my elbow and it freaking  hurts . It's swelling and throbbing as we speak.   Well, we finally make it to Mom and Dad's, and we realize that we left the key to the house back at our house. So, I slammed the laundry basket down on the ground, which further hurt my elbow, and I let a few words slip that I really shouldn't have and started to cry. So we load back up, Andy drives back to the house (and, trust me, you don't want to be in the truck when he's driving mad), takes me back to Mom and Dad's, and then drives off to work. No good-bye, no kiss, nothing. Plus, I'm starving because I haven't eaten since sometime yesterday afternoon, because we still don't have a working stove.  So, I come inside and try to call Dad because he's who I like to talk to when I'm upset-- he always puts things in perspective for me. But, his cell phone won't go through. So, I throw the phone across the room and commence bawling.  Well, as for right now, I'm developing a migraine, and I'm still hungry, but I managed to get through to Zak, which made me feel a little better. Plus, I'll take a shower later, which will halp rinse some of the bad feelings off of me.  ::sigh:: It's days like this I wish I had friends I could call. I really don't have anybody. And it sucks.

         You're Element is Water. You are soft and serene at most times but like Wind, you're scary when you're mad. You proabaly have a talent is singing and even your speaking voice is lovely. You have an innocent type of beauty that makes you look younger than you are and you like close relationships with people.     urlLink   What's Your Element(girls)? (PICTURES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Smeesh, did I ever fall apart this weekend. Apparantly I've gone from being mildly anemic to being all-out pretty freaking anemic. By Friday morning, I couldn't get out of bed. I just laid there and cried, because I was too tired to even move. So, Andy held me for a little while while I whimpered, and I was asleep again by the time he pulled out of the driveway to go to work. I slept solid for about 6 hours. Luna was ecstatic that someone was home with her, so she kept bringing me toys and snuggling next to me. I felt much better by the next day.  Mom's put me on a vitamin regamin and loaded me up with veggies, so I'm feeling better. Still a little weak and sleepy, but mentally, I'm wide awake.  Random note to self: I need to dye my hair again. Maybe red this time-- I haven't been a redhead in a little while.  We took Luna out to Andy's parents' yesterday, and decided to walk her across the field to the pond. Then, about halfway across the field, we took her leash off and just let her run. Chase, Tina's dog that she left with her parents, went with us, and the two of them bounced around in the grass chasing each other. It was so cute!  She's still worn out today. I don't think she's ever run that much in her whole life.  Oh, and Bennett and Alex, if you're reading this-- bring over a puppy! I wanna see one! Yay for puppies! :)

                  Heather Stringfellow was   a Sensitive Beer Brewer   in a past life.   Discover your past lives @ Quiz Me              It boggles the mind, no?  I've decided one thing I really really hate about college-- chatty bottle-job blondes who don't know when to shut up and show a little respect now and then. For example-- today, as part of the campus-wide "Month of Prayer," they had the Benson Auditoruim open from 7 to 8:50 so that people could have a quiet place to pray and reflect without being disturbed. So, around 8:20 or so, I go, figuring I've got about 30 minutes to collect my thoughts and have some meditation time. No. In come these bimbos, talking LOUDLY about stupid junk, like, "Ewww...is she really going out with him? and "Oh, I, like, soooo failed that test today!" No amount of throat clearing or glaring would shut them up. I was so close to giving them a piece of my mind, especially as there were several people around me who were really into their prayers that morning, when the bell rang for chapel. Grrr...  Or take yesterday morning, for example. We had a song service for yesterday's chapel, which these two bottle-jobs talked through. I mean, I barely saw them stop for air. When they got loud, I'd sing louder, which would quiet them down for about ten seconds. Then we learned this morning that those songs were being recorded by request of Searcy area soldiers who are currently in Iraq. Way to ruin a beautiful thing, bimbos.  So, all I'm saying is, if you're one of those people, stop it before I kill you, or beat you until my arm hurts. Oh, and if your roots extend almost all the way down to your ears, we can tell you're not a natural blonde.

      Oy veh, I'm tired. I have no idea why. Maybe it's because I'm more active than I used to be, and my body just can't handle it. Who knows? All I know is that if I were to lie down, I'd be asleep in five minutes.  Can you tell I'm avoiding work again? I'm supposed to be working on my Shakespeare assignment, studying for 2 tests, and reading  Major Barbara  for Contemp. Drama, and here I am on the internet.  Well, better get to it. I so cannot wait for Spring Break. Or at least Saturday.

      Well, V-day wasn't too bad. Andy and I slept in, then he took me for a late lunch at Olive Garden, during which it started snowing. So, we walked around the mall for a while, then walked outside to see it REALLY snowing, and decided to head back to town. It was really slick and hard to see, so we ended up doing 45 all the way back home. It wasn't snowing too badly there, so we went to Hastings, where Andy bought me a copy of  Greater Tuna , featuring the original Broadway cast. And, that was about it.  The snow sure was pretty. First snow we've had all winter.  I'm getting a lot of homework done lately. In fact, I've started scheduling times to work on my homework to make sure it's finished early. Yes, you may call me a nerd now.

Things are looking up lately. We're getting things settles on the car, the bank finally got around to setting up an internet account, so I can keep track of when the checks are run through, it turns out that we had a little more money than we thought (which is good, because insurance is due), and I get to sleep in tomorrow. That really excites me, for some reason.  Rehearsals are starting to kick in, as are the various projects for my upper-level classes. And, yeesh, there's a lot of them. Thankfully, I've been able to look at my schedule and set aside blocks of time in which to get things done. And ahead of schedule, which is good.  Lemme think...other news...  Oh, an old college friend of mine, Julie Clements, just had a baby. She emailed me a picture of him this morning, and he is absolutely beautiful! but then, it's also weird to think of people that I went to school with having kids and getting older. I mean, I don't think I'm getting older. In my mind, I just graduated high school. And yet, I saw a friend of mine the other day who just turned 30 and has two kids. Yeesh.  Ok, back to work on my Contemporary Drama paper, and then eat a sandwich while studying for Christian Home. Why does the sandwich seem to be the best part of that?

      Had the first rehearsal last night for  Not Picture Perfect , which was sooo fun! Details are in my  urlLink other blog .  Anyway, Andy worked late yesterday (10 hours) so he could come in late today and get the car situation straightened out. So, we get there at 9, and the place isn't open. So, we go across the street to McDonald's for breakfast. About 9:30, we go back to the mechanic's and it turns out that he's not there, but his assistant is, and the assistant can't do anything for us. So, Andy worked late and went in late for nothing. He was pissed. So, I have to go back this afternoon and see if I can do anything.  The auditor at the bank still hasn't contacted us. I hate to have to do it, but I may have to get Dad to throw some weight around. If I try to get things done, I'm a whiny little b*tch, but if Dad does it, people listen. ::sigh:: I'm just sick of not knowing exactly how much money we've got in the bank. These are the kind of things I sort of NEED to know! ::roll eyes::  ::dragging!:: Need caffiene! So sleepy! Must type theater history paper and read for production class! Want sleep!

Secretly, though, I just want to be loved in spite of my attitude and my goofy hat.   urlLink  Which Les Miserables Character Are You?           Bleh. That pretty much sums up how I'm doing today.  Yesterday, I finally let all the stress over our finances cave in on me and cried like a 6-year-old girl. Then I moved on. But I was feeling so crummy yesterday, I fell asleep on my mom's couch and slept through Robin and Trey's shows AND the strike afterwards. So, now I'm behind on tech time. But I really needed to rest.  Andy's been all edgy, but I think it's because I'm edgy too. But the dog has been sweet over the past couple of days and very snuggly.  I'm sleepy, and my tummy hurts. Plus, it's cold and rainy, and I have to walk clear across to the other end of campus by 1:00 today.  Just bleh!

        urlLink     urlLink Which Evil Villain Bad Habit are you?    I've come up with a plan. It came to me all of a sudden while I was trying to walk to the Reynolds Center. See, it was during class time, when people don't usually stop to let you cross the street. Well, someone actually did, so I waved at them. And it felt good that somebody actually acknowledged my existence for a couple of seconds to let me cross the street. And it made me feel nice. So, I smiled about it for a full five or ten minutes.  And so, my plan: acknowledge someone's existence for only a few seconds a day. Even if they're a total stranger. It'll make them feel good for a while, so they'll do the same thing for someone else. Eventually, we'll all get to noticing people around us and feeling good.  There you have it. My plan for world domination. Or something like that.  BTW, I just watched the finals for the county spelling bee. The winning word was "rhubarb."

        I am an Intellectual    urlLink     Which America Hating Minority Are You?     Happy Monday! Here's what happened over the weekend:  1) I studied like crazy. I never thought I'd get to the point in my life where I would study this much. I never did it in elementary school. I never did it in high school. I never did it for the first 5 years I screwed around in college. This alone shows you how dedicated I am to getting my degree, and in a timely manner.  2) Went to the first cast meeting of  The Boys Next Door  last night. Details in my theater journal.  3) Dusted my house to within an inch of its life. As an assignment for Vocal Performance, we're supposed to find three environmental or psychological factors that keep us from using our natural voices. I decided that dust was one of my factors. This meant that I had to eliminate as much dust from my environment as humanly possible. So, out came the duster, followed by cleaning my bedding. It must be working, because I'm not waking up with a sore throat anymore.  4) The fweaking truck broke down. Our only means of transportation. From what Andy can figure, it looks like the water pump's out. And here's the really bad news- Andy's amp fried last week. Why is that bad news? Well, his band's got some shows coming up, and he needs an amp. So, I gave him the go ahead to put some money down on a used amp, and then he traded in some extra equipment he had lying around on it too. So, the last little bit of money we had is gone. And then the truck goes kaput. Thankfully, Dad's got a mechanic that has done loads of work for our family over the years, so he may be able to give us a break on a repair job. But, we'll probably have to take out a small loan to do it, which sucks royally. So, Andy's not happy. And if Andy's not happy, it's difficult for me to be happy.  He seems better today, so I'm better too. With the exception of a sinus headache. Changes in the weather do that to me.  Mom and sis are looking after me. They picked up some microwave eatables and snacks for me to take to school, so I don't starve to death during the day.  Well, back to studying. Geez, I'm such a fweaking nerd.

Had a panic attack on Saturday, which sucked. I feel like I'm doing a bit much-- three shows, full-time classwork, and the usual housework. But I also feel like I have to do it, because I've got to prove that I can. To myself, to everyone. Whatever.  I need a nap again. I know I say that a lot, but I'm really not sleeping enough. My body is the type that requires about 10 hours to function properly, and I'm barely getting 7 on most nights. I'm so tired it's making me nauseous.  Anyway, things aren't all bad. Financially, we're pretty stable again. We're about to have to blow our state tax refund on new tires though. Plus, the brakes are starting to get squeaky, and Andy swears it's not his fault, but he's the only one who drives the dang thing! :)

      Yes, I'm still alive. I did nothing but research and type and type and reasearch all through spring break. Yeah, I did get to sleep in, which was freaking GREAT, but, still, that's a heckuva lot of homework.  And so, I returned to classes this week, only to be greeted with the prospect of more homework. Woo. Thankfully, I'm ahead of things again, so I should be able to get things done in a reasonable amount of time, somewhere between rehearsals and production meetings (see my other blog).  So, last night, we went to see  The Passion of the Christ , and, amazingly enough, it was Andy's idea! Wonders never cease. As far as the movie goes, its message was very powerful. For the first time ever in my entire life, the violence was so intense that it made me cry. I mean, yeah, I cry at movies, but never at violence, and this one did me in. So, if you haven't seen it yet, prepare yourself. Also, the actress playing Mary is AMAZING!  Well, off to revise rehearsal schedules.

      Happy birthday to meeeeee! :) Not a bad birthday, really. Steph, thanks for the dinner and cheesecake Saturday night. And thanks, everybody for the e-cards and emails!  Andy took yesterday off, and we slept in and ate doughnuts and watched movies. It was great. I got a card from Tina with a letter and a couple of pictures that Trenton drew for his Aunt Heather. Awww!  As for today, a midterm test, rehearsals for 2 shows, and getting tags for our car. Whee. Can I party or what?

      Oh, I thank the good Lord above that it's Friday. Now to concentrate on everything I gotta get done over the weekend...  -- finish master scene analysis for  The Glass Menagerie  -- work on the house staff for tonight's performance of  Love Letters  -- do a beat analysis for the scene from  A Doll's House  -- rehearsals for  The Boys Next Door  -- pre-production work for  The Ties That Bind  (they asked me to direct) -- read  'Night, Mother   ...and that's just the theater work. I still have to pay bills and what not. I'm sooooo thankful for spring break coming up soon.  I think I may skip Shakespeare class Monday night, so I can go to auditions for  Ties That Bind . Otherwise, they'll cast it for me, and I'll take who they give me. Not that I have a problem with that, but I would like to know who's showing up.  ::points above to birthday countdown:: Not much longer to go! Get me a good present! :)

      If anyone has any suggestions as to how to get "Toxic" by Britney Spears out of my head, I'd love to hear it. I've tried everything I can think of, and it's still there, urging me to shake my groove thang.  Great bumper sticker I saw on the way to school: "When women vote, Democrats win."

Well, I just saw something disturbing. A huge girl (we're talking, like, 400 pounds or so) wearing a midriff-baring shirt. Her navel was the size of an orange. People, people, learn your fashion limits. I mean, I've come to grips with the fact that my midriff-baring days are behind me, so can't others do the same?  Speaking of, I am so freaking hungry. And dizzy, for some reason. Well, back to essay-writing.

             You're  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy !  by Douglas Adams    Considered by many to be one of the funniest people around, you are quite an entertainer. You've also traveled to the far reaches of what you deem possible, often confused and unsure of yourself. Life continues to jostle you around like a marble, but it's shown you so much of the world that you don't care. Wacky adventures continue to lie ahead.  Your favorite number is 42.     Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .      I'll say it again,  Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  rocks hard core. Philly-style, even. And, after last night, looks like I'm going to have to watch  Mystic River  too.  My family is really taking care of us. They're trying to make sure we've at least got enough to cover bills, which it looks like we will. And Mom bought us a few groceries yesterday. No, the stove still isn't working, but at least we've got stuff so we can pack a lunch if we need to, to save a few dolalrs here and there.  And my wonderful brother gave me money to make sure we've got enough gas money to get Andy to work every day for the next couple of weeks.  I love my family.  Gotta go. Test in Christian Home today that I've barely prepared for.

      A brief update on the education situation--  Turns out that all, yes, ALL of my education classes have disappeared from my transcript. And since they have no actual proof that I took them I have to retake tham. All of them. All this summer.  ::sigh::

      And now, the sound of Heather screaming in frustration...  Once upon a time, I took a bunch of preliminary classes for an education major. Then I dropped the education part of my major, and concentrated just on theatre.  Fast forward five or so years.  Now that I'm actually  wanting  to add the education part back onto my major, they've changed the preliminary classes you have to take before you're admitted to the College of Education. For example. the "Intro to the Profession" class I once took has since been divided into two classes: "Philosophy of Education" and a semester of teacher observation.   You'd think that they'd take everything into consideration, that when I first entered college, I did what was required of me to complete Coll of Ed entrance. Not to mention the fact that I spent almost two years substitute teaching, including half a semester in which I was employed full time because the school lost their elementary music teacher. Well, you'd think wrong.  I go to the Education Dept. to see what they would suggest I do-- could they count that as credit and waive the observation semester? They said to check with my advisor. So I check with my advisor, who says, "I can't do anything about it. Check with the Education Dept."  ::pulling out hair::  I hate to do this, because it's so juvenile of me, but I may have to play the Daddy card. After all, he got his Masters in Education there, knows the staff, and since he's very large and imposing, people listen to him and get things done.  It's that or add another couple of semesters onto my college career, which I can't afford, and be forced to graduate sometime in 2007.  I'm not happy.

              I am  Mario . I like to jump around, and would lead a fairly serene and aimless existence if it weren't for my friends always getting into trouble. I love to help out, even when it puts me at risk. I seem to make friends with people who just can't stay out of trouble.      What Video Game Character Are You?     Went to see Spring Sing last night. The club shows were ok, but you could really tell the difference between the people who practiced and the people who didn't. The club shows this year feature snowboarders, Girl Scouts (in a huge trademark violation, if you ask me), football players, spies, the Trojan War, and bowlers. The hosts and hostesses were pretty good. Ok, to be honest, the hosts this year rocked, but the hostesses were a little weak. And this year, the jazz band  owned !  In other news, I discovered a girl who makes  urlLink flash cartoons about Harding University life , so I've included her in my links list. They're really funny, and they really clue you in on what it's like here on the Harding campus.  Meep. Rent's due today. I hate having to fork over a ton of money, but it's allowing me to be in town so I can go to school. So, I guess I can't really complain.

      More randomness...  * Bleh. I'm totally zonked on Day-Quil, and life feels so weird right now.  * For those interested, my presentation on Joan Littlewood went really well.  * I overslept and missed rehearsal this morning, which nobody has let me forget yet. * I really like the biscuits at Popeye's chicken. * I have way too much to do this evening. * There is a production on campus that I'm involved in every weekend for the next four weeks, followed by dead week, then finals. Then summer school starts. * I need a drink.  Thank you. That is all.

          Dark magician. You love the dark because of its beauty and just the life that no-one else sees. Mysterious, calm, quiet... But that doesn't mean you're not friendly!   urlLink   What kind of dark person are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Let me just say that I am so freaking pissed by the unnecessary slaughter of 26-year-old Nick Berg by Islamic extremists. I'm pissed that we had to go over there and act like jerks, treating their prisoners like animals. I'm pissed that they had to retaliate. And I'm pissed that people are going to treat this as another example of why we should be over there, when they don't want or need us in the first place.  By the way, many of you know that the full video of Berg's death is available on the internet. I don't suggest watching it. I did, because I can normally handle things like that, but it was really disturbing. Don't put yourself through that too.  I need to just defect to Canada. It's looking better every day.

          You have a twisted soul! Twisted Souls are never bad, and actually, are a rarity amongst souls. These souls are a little combination of everything, with always a little of their own chaos to add. Twisted Souls are kind, loving, weird, zany, temperamental, and very talented. They have their own firm opinion, and can at one time be very outspoken and passionate, and the other time shy and feeling insignificant. Twisted Souls have good senses of Humor and other times can be a bore. You can act quite intelligent at one time, and grasp concepts easily, while other times they can find it difficult to understand. Twisted Souls are always very fun and Kind, and can be party animals. But, if you love someone, you're serious about it, intense, and forever loyal. Congratulations-- the world should have more like you.   urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses? (For Girls only) Incredible Anime Pictures!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Well, two days worth of finals over with. Monday was rough-- comprehensive finals in Shakespeare and Contemporary Drama, and a big final in Christian Home. Thankfully, my grades are high enough this semester that I can bomb the finals and still pass. Good thing, because in that Chriatian Home final, I could only remember enough to answer 86 out of 100 questions. Not bad, but not great. Oh, the dangers of cramming all night for three tests.  Today was easier. We had a 38-question test for Vocal Performance, which I finished in 20 minutes. I came into class and presented Miller with a disk containing a Power Point presentation on the Bernoulli Effect, since he took forever to explain it to us, including his cheesy drawings. :)  Tomorrow, we meet at Midnight Oil (the coffee house just off-campus) to present our production binders, then I have Thursday off. Friday, we meet again at Midnight Oil, we all get coffee, then we go take the Theatre History test at 9.  Then three weeks off, then school again! The fun never stops.

         Your soul is OPTIMISTIC. You tent to look to the brighter side of things, and your positive outlook on life makes others happy. People love your open, unassuming nature and your innocent belief in good  for you, the grass on your side of the fence is always greener. You are rarely, if ever, pessimistic or doubtful, and you try your hardest to make life the best it can be, for yourself and others. You are a joyful and radiant soul.    urlLink   What Is Your Soul's Trait?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Classes continue to go well. My Field Experience class is a sophomore-level class to help someone decide whether they want to become a teacher or not. Lots of basic information and tech skills (such as "how to use email" and "how to search on the internet;" needless to say, I'm "bored out of my mind.") that we'll supposedly use in the classroom. Anyway, I've turned in everything ahead of schedule, so I get to play around during class time, which is cool, but it sucks that I'm paying about $1000 to do it.  Anyhoo, send me strength. Next session, I have a class that meets at 7:50 in the morning, followed by steady classes all day. ::le sigh::

          A GAME-BOY:  You're like a tomboy without the love of sports. Reality sucks, but as long as you have your electronics you feel you can cope. Time goes unnoticed when you're locked in your room hooked up to your Nintendo, rocking to your favourite collection of guitar-driven albums.  Your virtues:  Intelligence, sense-of-humour, individuality.  Your flaws:  Inability to cope with real life, action-freak spirit, reclusive nature.   urlLink   What kind of girl are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Had my first day of Child and Adolescent Devlopment today. So far, not too bad, and the teacher seems to like me (mainly because of my willingness to discuss the material).  Found out through the updated catalog today that I may have to take a TON of other classes in order to certify. This may take longer than I thought. Not good. I can't afford it.

         Lonliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but it's there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time. Your afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.  urlLink   What Emotion Dominates you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Well, on Monday, I start classes again. Whee. It's two intensive weeks on Child and Adolescent Development. I'm not looking forward to it, but I have to have it to get my teaching license.  Still working out scheduling issues, both for this summer and the fall. The business office screwed me royally when they held my account because the financial aid office was slow. ::sigh::  In other news, I'm still battling a sinus infection, my family just left for Europe a few minutes ago (I'm dying of jealousy-- I haven't been since high school), and my dog is barking at nothing and giving me a headache. I think I'm just cranky from too little sleep, though. I've had really bad insomnia the past few nights.  That's about it. Oh, anybody have any hints for Pokemon Yellow for the Game Boy? I'm hooked on it again.

      Ok, let the record show that I'm a total wussy.  I went to my first weight training class today. We meet four days a week for a month. Every class begins with 30 minutes of cardio. Then we do reps on the weight machines. Like, all of them. Seriously. Something like 12 different machines we have to use. Then we end with 25 ab crunches.  My body is already screaming at me.
