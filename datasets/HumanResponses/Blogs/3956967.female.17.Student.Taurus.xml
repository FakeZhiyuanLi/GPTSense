       yeah well the whole complaining today was over weight... y cant people just get the hint that its a sensitive subject to girls (well most minus the girls who are already born perfect.. i dont needa mention any names.. but im sure that&nbsp;u can think of a few, minus the celebrities) and well i was being harrassed by my family to y it is such a problem with me. well... considering that i am literally the fattest out of all my friends, i used to be half the size&nbsp; i was last year, and guys tipically like the "smaller" girls. i know that size does matter, my god it is soo fucking obvious!! i cannot wait for 3 months to go by so that i can lose all this shit on my body. my god&nbsp;i wish i was skinny. people say i am.. but i know i can be half the size.. and so it matters to me. i am love sick still... well i needa find someone, i have options, just never give them a chance. i needa lighten up, ive been keeping a food diary and logging everything down.. if only it were always that easy. its like 1 now.. i missed the dave concert... i wonder how it went.. god am i pissed. well i still have alot of prep time to get back into "shape" for winning back something something (not saying)... ahh christine kada where would i be with out you.. my gaaah (j. simpson- ha) hmm what would audrey do????

       ok... so my day hasnt been the brightest... in fact horrible.. i know that i said that i was going to run last nite.. but i didnt.. i didnt have the energy, i felt lost and weak.. i dont know what is up with me. i talked to a few friends online.. which i&nbsp;never go online to find startling information (cant spill all the beans) and i was alittle upset... god i wish i could just tell you.. but idont know who is reading this that i mite know, and im not all about spilling out all my emotions... god, im just so home sick... well really i miss my grandmother and her delish cooking, i miss my dad yelling at me (ha weird huh?) i miss my brothers, i miss my two goofy cousins (cammy and chel, oh i love you kids!) and my loving and thank-god understanding unlce lou... its not that i dont like it here.. i absolutally LOVE my uncle andrew, in fact&nbsp;hes prob one of my favorite uncles. his girlfriend sophia is wonderful, i couldnt have picked someone greater to be with my uncle and a part of my family.. its just that where-ever i go, i dont seem to feel a sense of belonging, god if only you understood. i dont have one half decent thing going on in my screwed up miserable life (wow i sound horrible!!) i hate my friendships, they are all meaningless and lessening everyday bc of well me, then the boy issue.. theres not even an issue bc theres nothing there, i dont like my step-mom, my dad is discusted with me.. im just the screwed up family member (every family has one) and&nbsp;a gunnie pig at that "lets make it a contest to see who can  save .. poor old jill.. who ever can get her to be someone decent of a person wins!" god, i cant take this anymore, i wish i could just esape into the oblivian. oh and to top that off, im doing soo bad in school (i dont even know what school im going to next year-- that is i go to a new school every friggen year) and i am in discust with my body.... its just gross i hate it.. i wish at least i had a hot body to at least even out my negativites.. this blows... i just ran, i feel weaker and weaker every day- like i cant run bc my legs will fall off.. and because i cant run as much as i was before i feel like im under-accomplishing what i can be doing.. and im a lazy fuck. the class im taking at coastal.. socialogy is actually quite entertaining.. i seem to really get the hang of it, maybe ill major in it at college (if i make it that far). that is if i feel like staying here any longer. man, im not eatting any more "unhealthy" foods anymore until i go down to a size 2!! better yet a size 0!! and running everyday that i have been. maybe if i dyed my hair, get a cut... wax my legs.. something ill look hotter? well im going to go to the pool.. swim alittle (not to burn calories.. im not in the mood), drink my herbal caffiene free tea (ahh spelling.. o well) and tan to a crisp brown.. at least ill look skinnier and feel hotter. damn those "natural beauties"

        well i am here... i ate too much today and feel like im getting lazier by the minute.. i feel like some part of me is missing.. mayb thats because i have to figure out my whole senior year in 3 fucking days!! i dont know what im going to do... i have a choice between three schools... a catholic school in which i LOVED.. i had a few good flings during those years which i would have to say have been the best (monica we did have some pretty crazy nites, and some old friends.. the sls click.. then the older gals.. then i had a few abington flings.. wow good times) , my oldest school to which i had alot of friends... then also some reallllyy bad memories that left a few of my rep there, and finally the last school that i was at.. which it took me a while to finally&nbsp; open up to everyone and when i did i had some good friends (tina... all you babe... and a really cool neighboor loren)... but i felt kinda like an intruder at the school.. considering i was entering in my junior year. this causes alot of stress.. i would like to really think about this one.. also the thoughts is where i should live... in ch, blue bell... gside? all comes down to my decision.. if only life were easier... oo audrey.. what i would give! i ate sooo much today, fuck counting calories... i ate well this morning.. until it hit me and all my problems led to eatting a bowl of cookie-dough icecream.... my favorite ahhhh briers is DEF the best... then i dont even know if i ate a slice of pizza... it was a oven-heated pizza which i ripped&nbsp;a huge slice off of.. to top that off i was just about to eat another tempting bowl of icecream but instead my uncles just-out-of-college friend said to be wise and go running... so here i am typing away.... the last thing on my mind is running. well i am thinking about my school year coming up... trying to look somewhat hot in comparison to all the skinny well groomed girls i have to deal with everyday. thats it... im going running.. i cant deal with all the family members around me telling me shit to do... if i have to become anorexic to lose my 15 pounds i will!!!! im out running my 4 miles... lyl jillian
