      Okay. So I finally got my web page to work (http://jmh.250free.com/webpage/index.htm) and it only took some smart thinking by Josh. Who woulda thunk that border="0" would fix everything? So, yeah, that's good.  And I went to the mall, picked up "The Killing Dance" by Laurell K. Hamilton PART OF the Anita Blake, VAMPIRE HUNTER series. Got that Alyssa? Loo. Good so far, and I'm only on page 6.  Didn't do much today, I slept until 2. And after going to the mall I have done nothing. What a wonderful day. SO FLIPPIN' BORED!!! GRRRRR... I tried to get Amanda to convince my brother to take me with them. It didn't work. She asked but he wouldn't take me. I'm so bored... Bleh Bleh Blah!  I had more to say when I first started this, but I forget now... Boredom has overtaken my mind.

      Yes, It's the end of the day. Or, the beginning of another.. I wasn't gonna post until I woke up.. But I have organized my thoughts already.  Okay, So, I DID get to go to Alyssa's. The pool people were gay. Gravy for me! I had a great time, as always. Helped her dad (loo) dig trenches. Well, a trench. Good times all around. I got yelled at for not eating.  It wasn't all fun and games tho. We sat down and talked too. She got mad at me. But I think we are overlooking it, for now. I dunno. I guess I didn't collect my thoughts very well. Loo.  It was a great time. No complaints. Except for the fact that she kicked me in the nuts.. That kinda hurt. And she didn't beat me in sumo-wrestling. No matter what she says. Loo, I am just so overwhelmed right now. I love the feeling I have. Well, Half of the feeling I have. I have a bad feeling about summer and the stuff me and Alyssa talked about. But I have this great feeling right now. I geuss it it because we went outside and just goofed off. I dunno. It felt like we were friends. Good friends, no, great friends. And there is no feeling better.

      Arrgh. Sundays suck. Not because it usually means school is the next day, not because I have to go to church. No, it's because it means my brother has to go to church. That's the rule of the house. Well, he thinks he doesn't have to go to church so he spend the whole time complaining, which gets my dad mad, which gets my mom mad, which snowballs into a horrible day. Oh well, I'll live... Well, Maybe not. More problems in the distance.  Okay, The near future. Apparently something broke on the pool, a little strap that helps the pool form. No biggie, go get a new peice slip it on... Everything's gravy, right? Hell no. As we are checking the strap to make sure it'll survive, I get wet. Now, I didn't fall it, it's not raining, and no one splashed me. How'd I get wet? A hole. A hole in the side of this "nearly indestructable" pool. Oh yeah, GREAT FUN. Let the cuss words start flying from my dad's mouth. So, they (my parents) stormed off to the pool place to get replacement stuff. So, I'm sure I'll spend most, if not all, of the day fixing that. Sorry Alyssa.  Whoa Whoa Whoa, Sorry Alyssa, how does that fit in there? Let me explain. Alyssa has been harrassing me to come and eat her pizza. No sexual inuendo intended. She wants to prove to me that she can cook without burning herself, or the house. And prove that she doesn't break things when she cooks. So, I'd like to go over, regardless if it's for pizza or not. But as of right now, the option doesn't look good.  Bleh, I really hope this day goes good. I also need to go to the mall and buy a book, because I hope to finish Bloody Bones by today or tomorrow. It's been a great book, I recommend the WHOLE series to anyone who is insteressted in books about vampires and the such. I dunno, I'm so confused. I really need to organize thoughts each and every morning.

      So, yesterday, I went to Amy's -and Erica's Graduation Party. Great, Great fun. I loved it. I met Amy's cousin, again, even though she didn't remember me. At first she was afraid of me. Lol. She came to her senses in the end tho. She was cool. Played DDR for my first time. Mucho fun. I think I might have to go buy it. Probably not new though, get it from the fat people who couldn't handle the exercise. Played pool, of course, won a few times. Good times all around.  Now to the serious part. I am really gonna miss Amy, and Erica for that matter. I didn't know Erica all to well, but I did know her. And she's a great person. I'm glad I got to know her. And Amy.. I'm gonna miss her so much. I will miss seeing her after school, at band (if I stay in). I'm gonna miss her so much. We've been through so much, and I've really gotten to know her this year. I wish it woulda started sooner, but hey. It's been good.  After the grad party, Matt and I headed back over to Amanda's. She wasn't there. Oh well, got to meet her aunt and uncle, and her dad. That's a fun family. We stayed for about 20-30 minutes, then headed back home. Nothing to do there, so I headed to bed.  Today, I got up and went to drums, not before I noticed I didn't practice all week, and my stuff was in my mom's car. So I lounged around and waited for her to show up. Luckily, she did and everything was fine. I didn't do as bad as I thought I would. That's always good. Loo.  Then I came home and did ABSOLUTLY nothing. I sat around and read the whole time, until now. Which, after I finish this, I'm going to do again. I need food too, though. Oh well. One thing at a time, I'll see when dinner is first.  So, I've made it to the end. Alyssa isn't on and Sarah just logged off... But, now Brad wants me to come to Frankie's. Which I don't particually want to do. I'd like to get some sleep today, and I have to help my parents set up the pool. I'm just gonna end this rambling now, and stop with the play by play.

      I have an idea. Let's throw all webpages away. I hate making them.. I am TRYING.. key word there. TRYING to get a semi-nice looking webpage. I got a template from Avtar, looked great. Right? Hell no, I went and got rid of a few things and it went to hell. Not only that but... I dunno. I gotta talk to Josh. Hopefully he can salvage it.... It's not that friggin' hard.  Bleh. I hate it. I need to get to sleep too. I keep depriving myself. AND I never got around to reading. Bleh! I wish school would end. Then I could stay up all night reading. It was a good day tho. Can't complain.  What I can complain about tho, is that fact that Akron U turned me down for post-secondary. GRRR! I hate french. Because of the 'C' in there I didn't have a 3.75 cum avg. DERN! I wanted to scream after I found that out. And apparetnly, I've came to a revelation, Alyssa is smarter than me! Who woulda thunk it. I know this already, don't have to tell me twice.  I'm a little weird on some stuff she talked to me about tho. I dunno. Nothing big. I just didn't see it. My problem, Not yours. Unless you happen to be Alyssa reading this. Loo. Then I think maybe they would involve you then.  Oh hey! Tomorrow is Amy's grad party! Yay! I can't wait. I love that girl. She's such a sister.  This is a lot longer than I thought it would be. Oh well, I guess that's why I call it the Abyss of Words. Abyss, never ending. Hey, Wanna know something? I love Alyssa. Just thought I'd point that out. Loo, i'm sure it didn't need it, but oh well.  Eh, Nothing else to say, really, or, at least, I can't think of what I was going to say. More to come later. I think this is more than I've ever written before.

      Well, Well, Well. I guess I needed to ramble, So I come here. Nothing fancy like the rest of the fools out there. But it's a nice substitute for a good friend. Loo. Yeah Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Doesn't EVERYBODY have a blog now. Well, Now I do too. So, Shut up and sit down.  Now, This will probably ramble a whole lot. But that's why we call it the Abyss Of Words. Notta lot to say right now. Oh, Just: If I offend you. Then I'm sorry. These are my words. Straight from my heart. To quote MTV: you think you know, but you have no idea. This is the diary of Jeremy Hirschfelt.  Haha. That made me laugh. Welp... I'ma finish this up... Read, then hit the sack. I'm reading a GREAT book right now. It's called Bloody Bones, by Laurell K. Hamilton. Mmm, I love this author... Her new book comes out in October!

      Yawn, What a story I have. But where does it begin? I'd guess we'd start it on Friday morning.  10 o'clock in the morning... I wake up for an 11:20 orthodontist appointment. Tons of fun those are. I might get my braces off in 2 months tho. That'd be awesome. Red, White, and Blue colors now. Boring Boring Boring  Next we head to Alyssa's house. We, I mean my mom and I, what a hootin' party that is. No, I don't mind my mom. But we pick up the lovely Alyssa and we head on over to Tinseltown to see Dodgeball staring Ben Stiller. Great Movie, Very Funny. I love the story of it. Awesome all together.  Then we, the party including Alyssa now, head to my sister's day care to pick her up. Then we, the party now including my sister, head to Alyssa's house.  At Alyssa's house, the party loses it's founding member and Alyssa. I stay at Alysa's house until 6:30. About an hour. Lots of fun as always. I'll get my 'What I learned' list later.  Then we headed out to babysit. Great fun. Really. The munchkins actually listened to me. Alyssa sucks at hide and seek. And I'll get the list later.  Got back around midnight-1:00. Went to bed after catching up on CB. Then at 7:00 the family left the house and headed to BGSU, to see the grad ceremony for BBS. Lots of fun to see it all happen. But no matter where you are in Ohio, it still seems like ohio. I've got a list for this too. Slepts through one of the meetings they had. The assemblies were cool, but it was boring otherwise.  I'd like to go when I'm a junior. Looks cool. Back today. Bought Blue Moon. Gotta Love Laurell. Now I'ma head to bed. G'Night. I'll get them lists later.

      Yee-Haw! Here we are, Monday. Woo-Hoo, It's a great Monday! No school. Mmm, It feels good. But I'm getting ahead of myself, we gotta catch y'all up on the weekend.  Friday, Friday, Friday! Amy WAS supposed to have a movie day, right? Well, It didn't happen, so I went over to Alyssa's. Great time as always. But then on Saturday we had, I'd guess you'd call it, a planned visit. So, I tried to separate them, but they kinda blended together. And I learned a few things while I was there too.       1) The phone is, in fact, evil and needs to stop ringing.      2) Answering simple questions on the phone can be, in fact, not simple. Especially under the influence on inhibitants.      3) Nancy knows all. Enough said.      4) Don't leave your pizza on the floor, especially if there is a hungry dog around.  I'll probably think of more later. Oh! I thought of another one already:       5) If you leave the basement door wide-open, there will be mosquitoes in the basement by the time you get back.  Good Times all around. The only bad part was, I still have to clean my room. Loo. I got away from it for those days, but it, for some odd reason, didn't clean itself. Ho Hum. What else is there...? On Saturday in the morning, had football, it's great to be back doing football, gives you a great feeling. Well, also on Saturday, Amy and Brad came by and picked up Alyssa and I and took us down to Sarah Campbell's grad party. Barely anyone there, but a good time anyways. Then we went and hung out a Deanna's, talked to her dad about Amy going into the Navy. Good Times again, I learned a lot about Amy's choice. Then she took the car-load to Pav's bought ice cream. (OH YEAH SUCKERS TAKE THAT!! I GOT FREE ICE CREAM!!!!) But then I had to pump her gas, no biggie tho. I STILL GOT THE FREE ICE CREAM!!! Then I went back to Alyssa and hung out for about an hour and then headed back home. Great day all the way.  Sunday was pretty mediocre. Not much happening, just went swimming all day. Got a sunburn on my face. Which kinda sucks. Cleaned a little. Gay stuff all the way.  And then today. I slept until noon, ate, cleaned a little, swam, went to football, ate again... Feeling great after football. I gotta clean some more tho. So, nice talking to y'all. I gotta go clean.

      Finals are over, Finals are over, Finals are over!! Whoo! School's over, School's over, School's over!!! Wee! I still got to wake up at 7 am! Whooo- Wait.. That's not cool. Damn you football, damn you to hell. Well, at least this camp. It's pretty gay, but oh well! It can't hurt. And I get a neat shirt, Loo!  So yeah, School's out for the summer! *crosses fingers* Hoping for that 3.75 gpa! Come on, I need it to get into post-secondary! Um.. I so hyper right now for some reason. It's kinda really weird. I need to clean my room. Wow, that was random. I need to go to sleep too. I'm also really itchy from them damn misquitos... And I have a sunburn on my face..  Not really much to say. I started a new book a few days ago... Burnt Offerings. Great book. I love Laurell K. Hamilton. I still have to read The Great Gatsby too. Loo, I'll spark note. Ramble Ramble Ramble. I'm done. I have nothing else to say.

      Whoo Wee! Let's see. *organizes his thoughts* Last time I wrote was the 4th so that starts us...  Here. Saturday, June 5th, my sister's 8th birthday. Not a big day, she got a TV and a batting helmet for softball. I had drums, as always, at 2 and I couldn't make it to Bosch's grad party. Mad me a little mad. But then I go to talk to Alyssa, and find out that she is at Andrea Golby's grad party (which I supposedly knew about). So, yeah, I sat bored at home. It was okay tho, I'd recover.  Oh wait, the next day would be Sunday. Not much a recovery at the end of the day. I got up did the church thing as usual. Then I headed out to Sarah's softball game, always a good time. We (Alyssa, Chris, and I) walked to Tim's house, but he wasn't there. All good fun tho. But then the trouble starts.  The game lasts too long. We miss the showing of Harry Potter we were gonna go see, and I still have to make it to my sister's b-day party at 6. The showing is 6:40. So, Obviously, I can't go. Accordingly, Alyssa gets mad at everyone. But we fixed it, a little bit. (I still think she was lying to me.) But I get dropped off at Chuck E. Cheese's and everyone else heads to Tinseltown. (Just across a few parking lots.) Time frame: 5:30. I head into CEC and hang around a little. Until my mom shows up, she gets the party going. Everyone shows up I talk for a little bit, play the games. I win 300 some tickets... So, I'm sitting there, out of tokens, and I'm really bored. No one cares to talk to me... So. Yeah. I get an idea. I'll walk to the movies. So I clear it with my parents and I'm allowed to go to the movies but I don't have a ride home. Dern. But, I'm a smart boy, Alyssa always tells me to call her mom if I need a ride. And I need one. So I call and now I have a ride home. I tell my parents the plan and high-tail it out of there.  Time frame: 6:43. Movie started at 6:40. I RUN across CEC's parking lot, a Lowe's parking lot, a street, and Tinseltown's parking lot. I get in and buy my ticket. Apparently, Alyssa's mom called the others and gave them a heads up. Alyssa meets me in the lobby, amazed that I showed up. But worried that my parents will hate me for me coming to the movies. I go into the movies during the Garfield preview and have a great time. I always love spending time with Alyssa. I also learned a new talent.... Lol...  Monday now... School day. Boring as always. I had a Ortho appt. but I wasn't going to miss reviewing for finals. So I cancelled that and stayed to study for Science.  Tuesday, FINALS START! Oh yay! Tons of fun here. I studied... For once. French was pretty easy, I just didn't know the Mettre verb. Oh well. English was easy. Gym, of course it was easy, run for 12 minutes. Even I can do it. History's is tomorrow. Math's was okay. A little tricky. Not one in Art. Science.. A little confusing, but I think I will do alright.. I need an A. Band, was gay.  One more day of school, I think I can survive.  Oh, crap. I forgot about my talk with Amy. Wow, is all I have to say. And I wish her the best of luck.  Essentially, Today is yesterday's tomorrow that you didn't care about.  !--::*ADDITION::*--!  I forgot about swimming, and how could I?!?!? I named this post after my expirience. I was swimming in my nice pool when I hear a splash. What could it be? I look over and peanut is swimming towards me. Loo. Who woulda thunk it?!? Loo, It was a funny story. I love swimming. And hey, my pool's open. Come on down to swim.

      Don't we have a lot of catching up to do! Okay, So. I think Alyssa is a teenie bit mad at me! Loo, She's totally and royally pissed at me!  I went and saw Harry Potter 3 today. Awesome movie I might add. But I went and saw it without her, BIG MISTAKE! No, Wait, That coulda been fixed. But, God was stupid and just HAPPENED to place my sister's birthday on June 5. So, Being that my sister's birthday party would be the next day. I won't be able to go with Alyssa. Oh, yeah. She hates me now.  And she gets mad at me because I have a SMALL obsession over Alexa Vega, Carmen from Spy Kids. And Emma Watson, from HP, is hot too. Sorry, I'm a guy.  But on to the good stuff. I went to the Graduation. I loved it. I almost cried when they showed the video and Justin was in it, laughing, smiling, and just having fun. I was so happy when they called Amy's name. I hope everything works out for her.  And, I've been told, Sarah Conley, won her softball game. Whoo Hoo! Yeah Yeah. But, there is also a pile of mulch in my driveway. Boo Hoo for me. Tomorrow my sister turns 8. Sunday is her birthday. Alyssa I will try to go with you. Depends on the time.  Don't hate me too much!

      Wow, I am pathetic. Not only did I not wake up at 10, but I didn't even run today. I think I am going to have to give up on that. I don't run, and I need to tell myself that. My body doesn't do it. I can run in football, or if I'm getting chased, but that's different. I guess I am just going to have to work a little harder at football. It's all good though, we are going to have an awesome season, you wait and see. I feel confident in the coaching staff and our players, we may not have a lot of people practicing, but the people we do have, want to be there, and they want to win. We are killing in passing scrimages, and the line is already better than it was last year, and we haven't even put pads on yet.    We're going to rock. Be prepared for more than a 10 week football season.

      So, I've decided to do something. I've decided to get in shape, not lose weight, but to get in shape. I want to get faster and have more endurance for football. I've decided to run/jog around my neighborhood, hopefully everyday. If I can't do it at night, I am going to try and get up earlier to run. I just want to be a good player.    I'm already working on lifting more, by going to the workouts, but I think it's time to take it into my own hands. I want to get faster, and there is only one way to do it, work on it by myself. My dad wants to get into shape and lose weight too, so I hope to run with him. That will give me more motivation. Just hopefully my dad won't give up.    Day 1 tomorrow. Get up AT 10 o'clock in the morning. Run.

      What the hell happened?? And when did it all happen?? No, I'm serious! What happened to the "good ol' days"? By the time I'm an adult, I won't be able to use the phrase, "the good ol' days!" Everything just seems to go down now-a-days. I rarely ever have a great day. A day where all of friends don't have anything to complain about. Some things just are stupid, and I wish they didn't happen, but it happens, and we need to live with it. I'm sorry for my fair share of stupidities, I know I've messed up.      So, anyways, life sucks a lot. Or am I the only one to notice that?? Sometimes my face gets tired of smiling, but I'm going to keep doing it, because I'm good at it. Don't yell at me for faking emotions, you do it too. I just have a good game face that makes it so you don't know unless I want you too.      And I wish I had more time to read, I love reading, but I can never find the time. I need to start puttin aside about an hour of my day to read. Reading is awesome, anyone who doesn't like to read is probably illiterate. I don't really have much to rant and rave about, I thought I did, but I've been    listening to music, that's why it has taken me 50 minutes to write this. Music rocks!      Change has a considerable psychological impact on the human mind. To the fearful it is threatening because it means that things may get worse. To the hopeful it is encouraging because things may get better. To the confident it is inspiring because the challenge exists to make things better.--King Whitney Jr.

      How's it my fault? Why do I ask questions, when you didn't care in the first place? Did I ask the "wrong" question? Was I not supposed to question it? Was I supposed to say, "Oops, I made a mistake, let me fix that for you?" And why should I?    I know what I did, it's not a news flash, and I know why I did it too. I have reasons. It was a big decision. I didn't just flip a coin. I thought about it a long time. I killed my parents with switching my choices so many times. I probably printed 10 different versions of a withdrawal slip. It was my decision. I did it on purpose.    I don't care about how bad of a choice YOU think it was. It was a good choice for my needs. I care about you, and I care about what you do, I care if you do well.    Just because I don't do it, doesn't mean I don't care about it. It's my school and I care about every aspect of it, until it starts not caring about me. I have "school spirit" just because I don't dress in funky clothes during spirit week doesn't mean anything. That's not what school spirit is to me. School spirit is about participating in sports and clubs, and caring when another sport does well. It's going and helping the new people in school. It's telling someone that you're from Coventry. Introducing yourself to someone as, "I'm Jeremy Hirschfelt and I go to Coventry."    I care about Coventry, that's why I live 16 miles away and still drive to school everyday. Coventry's my home. I plan to graduate from Coventry, and I plan to graduate with pride.    "In order to excel, you must be completely dedicated to your chosen sport. You must also be prepared to work hard and be willing to accept destructive criticism. Without 100% dedication, you won't be able to do this."

      Oh my gosh, this was an awesome day. I am so happy. Amy has helped me so much. I don't know what words to use to convey this. This was the best in the world. I'm so happy I don't know what to right. I love you Alyssa, I will always keep my promises to you, and my promises to Amy.

      This said something else, and if you read it, forget it. It meant nothing. Now I have something to be sorry for. I'm sorry for being so stupid. I'm sorry for not thinking. I'm sorry that the smart kid was stupid. I'm sorry. I can't say it enough. Thanks for being strong, but I'm not sure how much I can hold on. I'm going to try my best and beat myself over the head. It only hurts if I let it, right? If I just keep telling myself to keep smiling I will eventually listen, right? I'll be here forever. I'll never let go of you. You're my pride and joy. My heart, my other half. My heart will always long for your love. We'll make it through.  My feet shall run because of you. My feet shall dance because of you. My heart shall beat because of you. My eyes see because of you. My mind thinks because of you and I shall love because of you. -- Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider

      I wonder how long you have to think something is a good idea for it to become a bad idea again? I really am not as smart as I thought, there are a lot of things I don't know, but I guess I'm not the only one who doesn't know these things. Am I'm glad I have a girlfriend who can teach me all the things I missed out on in my sheltered childhood. She's truly the best person I know, I would do anything for her, and I can say that with full confidence. I really truly do love Alyssa, I love her with all my heart for ever and for always.  I really hate waiting too. It bothers me so much, but it doesn't matter, because everything is all right. Yup yup. I really like hanging out with Alyssa too. Some fun times. Ix-nay on line two, ix-nay on line two.   An Ice Covered Edge.   Why do I sit here in this suburb of boredom? Beaten and bruised, used and abused. The restrictions of age always bringing me down, Holding me here in this god-forsaken town. I want to get out and leave this place, Move away with a new game face. Yet, I want to stay here and I don't want to forget, But dwelling on memories will only get me what I get.  With so much crap going on, I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on. With the worries of love, and the worries of hate, And a few little worries about the eternal gate.  With so many emotions flying around, And my net crushed and powdered into the ground, It's so hard to catch just one thing to tackle, But I've got someone to help me through. Someone whom I love with every body part, From my head to my toes to my heart.  Never giving up on what can stay true, To her: I'll never give up on you. I love you no matter what the outcome, And it my make my heart expand some.  Hate the action, not the sinner: A word of advice said over dinner, Could never be more true. It's time to get up and think about life, Think about the path I want to take, And stop and think about the decisions I make. Think about how they could affect me in later years, And will those effects bring me down in tears.  I want everything to be all right, And that why we had that talk. Fifteen isn't even half my life, It's not even a quarter of the walk.  Remember your promise and keep it true, No matter what it could do. Though I've promised to you and messed it up, Don't give up on me yet. I'm sorry I've screwed up in so many ways, Had so many wasted days. I still love you, And it'll always stay true, I wish there was something that I could do.  I feel so bad for my mistakes, And I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Isn't there another guy you'd rather be with? Or are you going to sit there and plead the fifth? I'm sure I'm not the best you can do, And I feel I've let you down so much. I'm having so much trouble taking care of you, My mind just turns to mush.  I'm sorry, is all I have to say, And I feel like I'm saying goodbye today. I don't know why and I don't know when, But I fear an inevitable end.  Drifting away and drifting apart? You hold all the pieces of my heart. IT'S NOT GOODBYE, IT'S NOT THE END. Forgive me for I have sinned. I'm having trouble holding on, My hands tremble,  And my feet scoot closer to the edge. Hold me and help me fix it all, Help me round the edges of the misshapen ball.

      I wonder how long you have to think something is a bad idea until it stops being a bad idea? Hmmm...I haven't written here in a long time. Alyssa kept yelling at me so I started writing again.  I went to West Virginia to see the family. Ya know how it goes, it was fun though. Let's see, on the way there my mom heads into Parkersburg to eat, when she leaves she head west to go east, I finally convince her, and she turns around. Okay, so now we're heading east, and she see's the 7th street exit sign, where we just got off at to go eat, she gets off. She turns around, I convince her she's going the wrong way, rise, lather and repeat, about 3 times.  I found a lighter while in WV, I went up Seneca Rocks, a big mountain, on the way back down some guy left his cigarettes and lighter, I just stole the lighter! I used the lighter to light fireworks, which I burnt myself with... That hurt.  On the way out, my mom leaves going 33 West (the right way), I fall asleep and next thing I know we are going up 250 north (the wrong way). We take 250 N for about a half and hour and we get on 119 North, we follow that for about 20 minutes until we end up in Grafton, home of Coach Newcome. Finally we find 50 West (the right way) and head back home. All the while, I'm in the back seat with 2 eight-year-old girls... What a nightmare!  I'm probably missing something in here, oh well, now we move onto Tim's Birthday party. It was good fun, after I stopped getting yelled at. I always love being around people.  That was yesterday, today I went over again. Good times all around. I got to go shopping and tell Alyssa how ugly everything she picked out was. She did end up picking cool shoes though, that's always good.  More later, if you want it sooner, than, oh well. Sue me. Oh, And I'll give it to you orally in a minute.

      You guys need lifes! Geez! No, Seriously, You guys have no lifes, at ALL! 20K keys ahead of me! I have stuff to do. I haven't been home for the past 4 days, and I won't be home for the next 2 weeks. I will be in last place no matter what I do. You guys need lifes!!!!  Okay, enough about that. Now onto my birthday party. It was aweomse, I love you guys. Thank you Alyssa for making me have the party. I love my friends so much. Thanks for all the little toys... You guys... Ahh, I don't have words for it. We have the people who skip going to tradition to make it to my party; we have those who come even if they have to come late, we have those who come for the food, loo, joke; we have those who come after the party just to say happy birthday.  Frank you are awesome, that meant a lot to me. I come up to my computer, and you left me an IM saying you weren't sure if you were going to make it, then an hour after the party is over we hear loud music stop outside my house, and it's none other than Frankie. Alyssa runs outside to a bounding hug, and I follow. Sarah later comes out. Frankie's there for maybe only 2 minutes, just long enough to give hugs and wish me a happy birthday and then leaves. It was awesome. He could have stayed if he wanted but he didn't, which means he drove about 15-30 minutes just to say, "Happy Birthday!" It meant so much to me, thanks!  The trip to the store, and Pav's. You guys rock.  Oh, Alyssa, thanks for the cake. To Alyssa and Sarah: Thanks for eating my pudding, I couldn't have eaten it all without you two.

      Oh! That burns my butt so much. I went babysitting with Alyssa at her Aunt and Uncle's house. Kaylee came later. I told my mom I'd be home around 1 o'clock maybe later. I WAS babysitting. So I end up coming home around 2:30, a little later than projected, I was sorry for that, I didn't expect that. My mom is waiting at the door, need I remind you that this is the lady who is ALWAYS yelling because she doesn't get enough sleep? She tells me that I will "not do this again." She says that, "It's 2:30 and I'm worried about you. And your dad wasn't happy you were babysitting anyways." Okay, 1) Why didn't he say something before I told Alyssa I would babysit with her, and 2) Why would she be worried, it wasn't like I was at a party, I was babysitting with 2 other people.  So, that was gay. Oh well. Amy assures me all moms are like that. So, I guess I won't be babysitting again, I actually have fun there. The kids listen to me. I'm sure my parents do it on purpose. They don't trust me.  Screw them.  "Parents were invented to make children happy by giving them something to ignore."

       Sexual Tension   This isn’t the center of the universe, This isn’t the pivotal point. Without it, we’ll still survive, Without it, it’ll still be alive. My arms will still be comfort; My shoulder still soggy with tears; My eyes still open, watching; My mind caring about your fears. I want to be forever, I want to live to be, I want to be there with you, I want you to be there with me.  We need to fix the problem, Before it becomes a problem, It’ll just keep to bubble, And only lead to trouble. I care in everyway possible, And that’s why I do this for you, So it lasts many years, And not just a few.  I’ve been told, So many times, And in so many ways, To fight this feeling, And not let it rule my days.  The elders have spoken, And the advice given is good. I think we need to listen, For both of our good.

      Whoooooooo Weeeeeeeeee! I'm fifteen, oh yeah. Birthday! Gotsa ta love it!  So yeah, I'm fifteen, My birthday was yesterday. It was awesome, I wake up and found out my mom has bought an ice cream cake from DQ, Dairy Queen, which is ALWAYS cool! Wait, I missed something, I wake up to Alyssa. She has called my house to tell me that she is taking me to see a movie. That movie being irobot. Starring Wil Smith, Alyssa said it made her sad but I don't buy that. Loo, Just Kidding.  So I go over to Alyssa's house afterwards, because she was my ride back to my house, I call my parents to see if Alyssa can come, and she can. So we go back to my house and find out that my parents bought me an MP3 player, which is cool. And then Alyssa and I (with a little of my sister) swim for a little, then we hang around and watch TV. Then we go back and drop off Alyssa.  I still have poison ivy, and it still itches a lot. But, Oh well. I'll live.  Today I didn't do much. I read a little bit, hung out with my brother and Amanda at my house, then hung out at Amanda's house. Mucho fun, I guess.  Party's on Sunday!
