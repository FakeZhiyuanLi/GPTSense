      I'm resenting my student teaching practicum for only one reason - the lack of time I have to craft!  I was able to knit a few rows on a cotton scarf a couple nights ago, but it was sorely inadequate to satisfy my crafting fix.  -I have a book shelf sitting on the patio waiting a second coat of purple paint and a few other finishing touches... -along with a couple other household items waiting to be painted... -countless knitting and crocheting projects... -my new glass-etching projects...  If I could knit during my own downtime at school... that would be too awesome and probably not the best personal recommendation to the school administrators if they were to peek in.  In other news, I am going to go shopping this afternoon.  urlLink  Target.   That'll satisfy some urge in me...

          When I looked out my window Many sights to see And when I looked in my window So many different people to be That is strange, so strange You got to pick out every stitch Must be the season of the witch   I have been so happy the last few days.  I wake up in the morning and have a bowl of bran flakes (sometimes with fresh strawberries) and soymilk.  I tend to the dogs (kinda like tending to the herd, when you have five of them) - picking up toys, cleaning up pee-pads, mixing up food for the puppies.  They are almost six weeks old and they are playful and curious (pics to come soon).  I pick up all the stray cups and plates and load them into the dishwasher.  After all of this cleaning, I take a shower myself.  Make the bed.  Think about lunch.  Sit down and cross stitch for a while.  Heat up leftovers for lunch or make a nice veggie bologna sandwich.  Go back to cross stitching.  Pop in a DVD to watch while I stitch.  Think about leaving the house.  Think about what color to work on next.  I know it sounds mundane.  I ended up being more  housewifey  than I ever imagined I'd be.  But a person should do whatever makes them happy - whether it's buying stocks or cross stitching butterflies.  Don't get me wrong, I'm excited about classes starting again and (eventually) teaching.  But I'll carry these other projects with me - needles, yarn, thread, and scissors - in whatever direction life goes.

      First, before the essay starts... I thought for the past few days about whether or not to post this.  The subject is so personal and horrific.  And yet it has been a good exercise for me, to expel some inner demons of sorts, and get some practice with non-fiction.  But I won't disclaim any further.        When I was 14, I was obsessed with dying.  The way most fourteen-year olds are obsessed with acne, the opposite sex, and video games.  I think I was mildly obsessed with those things too – but everything was just another reason to die.  If I had five (never just one) new zits, it meant I needed to die.  If the new boy I was crushing on walked down the school hallway hand-in-hand with another girl, then it meant I should have never been born.  Of course, at the time, I blamed my parents.  Specifically, my mother.  My father was never around enough, or “plugged in” to the family.  My mother, on the other hand, was around every corner and behind my every footstep.  Children usually blame their parents for the problems in their lives.  I did my share.  The way my mother was absurdly strict – when I never so much as kissed a boy in high school – seemed to be the basis of most of my complaints.  My mother could be cold and cruel, and without knowing it, could push all my teenage hormonal buttons.  She could be crazy at times, too, which I wouldn’t realize until years and years later.  	One phrase that I hear parents say, or are quoted as saying, is: “I brought you into this world, and I can take you out of it.”  Something along those lines, at least.  The meaning is, roughly, that if they see you messing up your life (the life they gave you), then they will take it back.  I don’t know what that means to most parents who say this or children who hear it.  Does that mean that you will literally kill your child? Does that mean that you will beat your child, so that she might wish she were dead? It’s one thing to nurture in a child a sense that life is precious, and quite another to tell a child that you will strip her of her life because she is taking it for granted.  	Well, my mother is special in her own crazy way.  The day after I had attempted suicide, she made me go to church.  I remember wearing an absurd white dress with pink flowers on it.  It was absurd because it barely fit me anymore, it was so old, and I had these hideous bandages on my wrists.  And before I go on, let me just say, that my parents did not take me to the hospital.  They did not take me to a counselor.  They did not call the police.  They did not call our priest.  They did not call anybody.  My father held a cloth to my wounds, while my mother yelled and cursed at me from behind.  How I slept that night is unknown.  	So, we went to church.  I don’t remember what the priest said.  I don’t know if any of the readings were influential or remarkable.  I don’t know if I stood and kneeled at the right times, but I think I must have.  After church, my mother drove in the direction away from our house.  We were going into the wooded areas surrounding the town, where the hidden lakes and creeks were ideal picnic spots.  She drove the car quietly, though I asked about where we were going.  She was hot in her anger towards me, and her anger made her silent.  	We didn’t stop until the car was parked as far as it could go – on the edge of a small cliff, hidden behind a small gathering of skinny trees and overlooking a trickle of a creek.  I remembered that our family had been out this way before, that we had swam in other parts of that creek in happier times, in younger days.  It was here, that my mother provided her own version of, “I brought you into this world, and I’ll take you out of it.”  She threatened that if I wanted to die, that I should go ahead and let her know now.  If I really wanted to kill myself, she’d have no problem putting the car into gear and driving us over the cliff.  She meant to take us both out that very afternoon, sitting in our parked car, in a normally familial location, at high noon.  	My death, or my dying, had become about my mother, and was no longer about me.  The air in the car was becoming stuffy, with the stale air blowing from the car’s air-conditioning and the windows sealed shut.  It was a warm day in October, and I was sitting in a metal coffin.  I wished to have the courage to die with her that day, but I had the crazy notion that I should live.  I had the crazy idea that I had my own life to live.  We drove home that afternoon, and I locked myself in my room, where I had laid newspaper out on the floor the day before.  I crumpled the paper up and smudged ink on my hands.  Not even ink on the page is indefinite.  Nor are scars.  	So, more than ten years later, hundreds of ideas and obsessions later, I don’t want to blame my mother (or father) for my problems.  I know I still can, but I don’t want to anymore.  If I keep blaming my mother, it’s as though I’m locked inside that car, on that October afternoon.  It doesn’t erase the wrongs that happened; nothing could ever do that.  I want to live my own life.  And die my own death.  If I keep looking back, I won’t see the view from the cliff.  I won’t know about the danger or beauty that awaits.

       “The aesthetic provides a space where the immediate pressures of ethical and political decisions are deferred, so it allows sympathy for, and potential understanding of people, events, things otherwise threatening."                     -  George Levine                     introduction,  Aethestics and Ideology    When I needed space, you were too close, breathing out hot blasts of steam that scorched and wilted my will. You saw that I was down, like a fish laid out on newspaper, too dead to move. I wonder if you got any pleasure from watching me. Did you imagine that it was your hand on the knife instead?  The next day it was you who drove into the woods, after church, after our prayers. It was you who threatened and paced, while the car rocked on the cliff’s edge.  I dried my own tears, while considering the view from the passenger side window. The creek bed below – shallow, cluttered with dusty yellow and rust colored stones – etched after centuries of effort, of water moving over.  This was the only way I found to make peace with the bitter taste of your love. And as much as you think otherwise, I will one day  walk alone into my own death.   ... Okay, so that was the poem that I've been struggling with - to write for an exercise from  Writing Creative Nonfiction .  Next, the prose component.  Mmmm, fun.

      So I started my first day at GPC, as a writing tutor.  I helped one student revise her paper, which could not be more than 500 words.  It was due in a few hours, and she had nearly 700 words.  So we pruned her paper like a beautiful rose bush that needed to fit inside of a mailbox.  Apparently, students would lose 5 points for every 25 words over or under the limit.  Perhaps her professor's requirements were too rigid.  Perhaps he wasn't aware that some things can be best explained in 765 words, or in 348 words.  Who knows.  From the moment I started, I was warned to not make any corrections without discussing them with the student.  It makes sense.  You wouldn't want the student to just change the work and not internalize the corrections.  It's hard, though.  There's a fine line between guiding students and doing the work for them.  You can show them their problems, but in the end, have they learned how to prevent those problems in the first place?  How much can I be expected to do in the "20 minute" tutoring session?  For many of these students, English is not their first language.  And especially, grammar is not their first obsession.  It isn't mine, either.  But control over language is obviously and utterly important.  My second problem with "tutoring" is not to give the student the ideas.  I'll say, "You should consider revising this sentence.  It can say something like..." and then I hold back.  If I say what I would write, will they just use that? So, I disclaim and disclaim.  "Something like this..." "In your own words..."  Unfortunately, I don't think we're teaching our kids to think, speak, or write in their own words.  That's why essays and papers are so challenging for students.  Their eyes look up at you, begging for the right words - your words.  As children and young adults start writing poetry and stories, they depend on cliches and familiar phrases - "Roses are red, violets are blue..." and "Once upon a time..."  For many, these crutches are never removed.  The bones are never tested, to see if they've set, and the muscles get weak.  I've never been much of a pruner.  I let my plants grow wild, instead.  I had a basil plant that grew up to 3 feet high - which I thought was unusual and even emailed Guinness World Records about.  Turns out basil plants normally grow to that size.  Normal meaning when not pruned to death by their owners.  When not confined to small kitchen windowsills and modest pots.  I let  my  basil grow wild, and it was sweet while it lasted.

      Okay, so Thursday night kind of put me into a daze.  I found out that Dekalb County School System administrators have decided to fire (?) everyone at McNair Middle School (just where I happen to have employment for next year).   They are asking that everyone reapply to make sure that only those that want to be at McNair next year are there - including everyone from the prinicpal to the school janitor.  Reportedly, the reason for the "shake-up" is low test scores.  Well, that's an interesting tactic.  Other than concern over my own position there, and whether or not I want to be there now, which does weigh heavily on my mind, I am concerned about the students.  The "sweeping" of the school sends a terrible message to students who are already struggling with so many issues.  And next year, how many new teachers and staff will there be?  What familiar faces will greet the students?  What sense of familiarity and security will these students have?  Let alone the teachers that face unfamiliar students and staff.  On the  urlLink news , the reporter interviewed several parents about the situation.  They all seemed to welcome the change and hoped that the situation at McNair would improve as a result.  They talked about teachers who didn't care about students and administrators who only cared about their salaries.  Am I the only one who doesn't understand the "blame the teacher" concept?  Teachers are the ones not getting enough credit.  They don't have enough resources - including books, access to technology, smaller class sizes, etc.  When can we put blame where it belongs? On the students, the parents, the lack of community support, and society's disregard for education.  I don't see a bright future ahead of us, as teachers, as Americans, or as world citizens.  In our society especially, we are becoming more complacent, over-eating, over-spending, violent, and self-righteous.  And stupid.  Don't forget stupid.

      "Not all balm is benefit. There is no cure, only liniment and anodyne, antiseptic patchwork." - from   Jeremy's   urlLink Junkmail for Blankets .  You would think that a vacation would bring you back cured, rested, ready for the fight again.  And life sometimes is like a fight - punch, punch, right hook, knock out.  Flat on your ass, if you were to take a mental break for... about 5 days, would you come back to consciousness ready to go 12 more rounds?  Probably not.  So, is my argument - why 2 days in a train and 3 and 1/2 days in the "Big Easy" are not vacation enough.  I feel tired, have lots of laundry to do, and have even more projects and "to do"s to do.  Writing, even, is not exactly a balm or cure for my wounds.  Writing is a kind of vacuum, or air current, that stirs dust and leaves you breathless.  The writing exercise I'm trying to do requires that I first write a poem about a story or event in my life.  I have a story in mind, but it's way too emotional for me.  I'm afraid that after I've opened the story up, it will harden like baked clay.  And the memory of it, the solidness of it, will shatter me into shards.  So, I don't write, and the story builds in my mind, like a reflection in the rearview mirror.  I keep looking back and my foot presses harder on the accelerator.  I'm home from my vacation, but my mind is still hundreds of miles away.

      Traveling is a matter of time and space.  Moving away or forward.  You've heard the saying about a river never being the same... it expands exponentially to encompass everything.  I have been to this place before but I am not the same as I was then.  I will not return the same.  The train will take me along the same path - in reverse - but it will be a different path, familiar, winding towards home, cluttered with thoughts like souvenirs.  The other thing is that some things stay the same, and are the same.  New Orleans or Atlanta - people are generally the same and our needs, our longings to find friends and be happy, are the same.  Whether the termites are swarming or the ladybugs are swarming, each place has its crowds, its complications.  Each has its music and starlight.  I'll be on the 7 am train to Georgia. Sorry, there wasn't a midnight one.

      So, after a week of stressing about loans and credit and the state of the world, it was time to sit and relax at the local craft group.  I was working on a blanket for my mother-in-law-to-be; after almost 2 hours of knitting, I had only finished about 2 inches.  Fortunately, her birthday is in January!  I've started to read  Writing Creative Nonfiction , edited by Carolyn Forche, and my last post "Why I Write?" was the first exercise.  The book is a combination of discussions of creative nonfiction, examples, and exercises or prompts.  Unfortuantely, I'm stuck on the second exercise.  The prompt is to write a poem about a story, memory, or incident in your life.  Then identify the subject of the poem and write a short essay/non-fiction/prose piece on that subject.  I haven't been inspired yet.  Or, I can't think of an interesting story, that I haven't written about already.  I'm going out of town tomorrow, until Tuesday.  I hope to get a lot of knitting, writing, and reading done on the 12 hour train ride to New Orleans.  Wish me a safe trip.

      The animal’s mouth stretched open, teeth bared and half-lit.  I saw her breathing like thin smoke.  His hand is already there, pulling at my breast and clutching at my skin.  I fight to turn my bubbling thoughts into helium, something light, something that floats.  He believes he is being gentle, undoing all the buttons, until everything is loose.  By then her growl had cooled, her jaw gone slack.  I heard the rattle of her chain in the grass.  No bruises or scars will be left behind as he works invisibly, under the cover of this shameful night.  I am reminded so often of her vapor-like bones, buried for years in my grandmother’s garden.  So deep the dirt around them is like solid rock.   This is a poem I wrote a few years ago, but had workshopped during the recent Agnes Scott College Writers' Festival.  I was a poetry finalist and was able to work with  urlLink Chitra Divakaruni , a wonderful Asian American writer.  I was able only recently to revise the poem, and this is what happened.  Hope it's better!

      I write to get these Sylvia Plath ghosts out of my head.  I write to process.  I write to move closer to forgiveness of the past.  I write to move closer to the future.  I write to hear myself talk.  I write to be one of the few people that listen to me.  I write to remember words.  I write to get angry again and pace in puddles of my own pain.  I write to document.  I write to excise.  I write to know I'm alive and good at something.  I hope.  I write and write and write.  I write to respond.  I write to love, not in the love poem way, but cuddling some hungry starved being to my breast kind of way.  I write to keep from dying, to keep thoughts of car accidents and falls down the stairs in the shadows.  I write to keep balance, myself between the world and an endless sleep.  I write because the voices tell me.  She would have written if she had language.  Strange that a person would be denied that, but they are, not only her.  Strange to imagine that you can't even write down your thoughts, desires, fears, and dreams.  That pen in hand meant frustration and shame.  When I consider it that way, I can see how she began to rage, and how that rage went everywhere like shattered glass or a spray of water.  I see, also, how her children could have been like words for her.  Words that express and communicate.  Words that love and follow dreams.  Words that sometimes bite back and sting.  She didn't know that words could do that, or that children were so tedious and wandering.  She wanted us to be her words, that she took time to pin down and make just so.  A poem that didn't wiggle squirm cry when tickled too long.  Her lack of language took so much from her.  And from me.  When you mother something, are you giving birth to it, caring for it, and nurturing it?  Or are you clutching at your insides with fear and derision, as if you could change what had happened to you in the past, in the long ago past, when even time and place held forgiveness?  Do you end up taking out the anger for  your  mother on your own creation?  Toothless babies that only remind you of your own decay and stifled brilliance.  If you do, then you are wrong.  You are my mother and you are wrong.  I don't know where to put you anymore, since you insist on tearing my heart to shreds every time.

      I'm never shopping at Kroger or Publix or a chain "grocery store" again.  Never is a strong word.  But hunger is a strong hurt, dignity stripped from you like the peel of a banana, leaving your soft muscles exposed.  There are ways of dying that hurt less than ways we make people live.  It's not guilt I'm feeling, I assure myself.  It's humility, it's anger.  I need to rip myself from this teat of American agribusiness, which has been feeding me lies, packaged ever so nicely and 100% guaranteed.  I'm ashamed that I have bags of pre-washed and pre-cut lettuce in my refrigerator.  I am ashamed by the convenience of my complicity.  In the  urlLink film  we saw last night hosted by the  urlLink Atlanta Independent Media Center , the line that stuck out the most for me was (something like), "Why do we think we know what's best for the world?"  I agree.  I've been saying that in one form or another since this war started.  I don't claim to know what is best for anyone else; I barely even do what's right for me.  But I need to start.  For a woman, age 27, who is overweight, has chronic anemia, and is about to lose an ovary (surgery postponed till August), I need to start.  I'm only human and I will try to do what is humanly possible.  Which is a lot, actually.

      Hot.  The only thing predictable about this place, is that you will eventually find yourself breathing in its heat, stifled, stuffed, and sweating.  All of your composure gone, and you're left exposed, a sad human like everyone else.  I went to ring the bell today, at Agnes Scott College, since I missed the bell ringing last week.  We waited in line and giggled when it was our turn.  The rope made us feel clumsy and light, as it pulled us up toward the tower.  The momentum of our bell ringing would last for minutes afterwards, longer than any of us every considered.  It was a tradition with history, like those villages and towns you hear about that perform dangerous acts or cultural ceremonies once a year on its virgins or fools.  Which was I? I wondered.  Soon, some of these girls, in their Old Navy flip flops and Urban Outfitters skirts, would be leaving their careers for engagements and marriages.  I imagined the same giggles and forced poses at bridal showers and receptions.  I knew that no one would picture me there, not that I would picture myself in those situations.  I'd rather save money for a house than buy ridiculous napkins with my and my boyfriend's names on them.  And even though I like the idea of ringing a bell to celebrate my new job - my new career, my advancement in life - I knew that I wanted a personally significant rite.  Maybe I could walk around campus with a tibetan bowl or throw rose petals at my professors' feet.  I can't think of the proper ceremony.  All I know is that I'm not one of those blushing brides or dancing fools.

       "You can learn many things from children. How much patience you have, for instance."  - Franklin P. Jones (though, I don't know really who that is)  I need to learn a lesson of patience today.  My child, of course, is my chihuahua, Ernesto.  He deserves the most patience, and I need to find some within myself today, just for him.  Whether it's my eyeglasses or my cell phone (like today), Ernesto is hungering to chew.  His chewing is like speech, sometimes.  Instead of coloring pictures for me, like a human child would, he chews the antenna off of my cell phone.  But like a child's finger painting that ends up on the wall or carpet, I need to dig deep inside to find the humour of the situation - to find new knots of patience waiting to be unraveled - instead of just freaking out at the kid.  Of course, he gets a look on his face that says he knows he did wrong, but that he loves me.   I love you, momma, so don't freak out.   I know for sure I have knots of anger waiting to  explode .  I've seen the flushed red and blurred lights results of my anger.  Felt self-hatred, like a deep breath, a rush of blood, a quickly forming bruise, too often.  That's the worst of it all.  I turn in on myself.  Maybe I end up eating all my extra patience, like a mad werewoman, flashing teeth and snarling.  Maybe my patience tastes sweet, like Krispy Kreme doughnuts.  Or tart like NY cheesecake.  A perflect blend of sweet and tangy, with the texture of a graceful evening under the stars.  I would be the most patient person in the world if that were the case.  Right now, I'm not so sure.  Why did The Hulk turn green when he was angry? I would think that he would turn red - crimson, fire truck, burgundy, apple.  Some hue of red - like clay or blood.  But he turned green.  His anger was beyond normal, beyond simply red.  His rage was crippling and enabling in the same way.  The way adrenaline kicks in when you least expect it and need it most - buried under a car or watching your children suffer needlessly.  How does patience relate to forgiveness?  Is patience the well from which the forgiveness runs?  Forgiveness seems more like a state of being, and patience a rope that's pulled.  Pulled and pulled, until the sound of the metal *clink* indicating the end, the limit, the bottom.  I'm feeling closer now to forgiving Ernesto, and see my patience being restored.  The rope is longer than I thought, than I gave myself credit for.  The pulse of blood is settling and finding its usual rhythm again.  I look into his eyes and see his innocence again.  Because he is innocent.  And my love for him, my forgiveness, and patience for him - lends me some innocence too.

      I'm proud that I have been knitting more lately, and reading more, even with the stress and busy-ness of academia.  Of course, ploughing through self-help manuals and dieting guides have fallen into the ditch of my current path, but alas.  I have managed to make a few friends, or at least some connections, which might grow from these unsteady tendrils to blossoms of friendship.  I can hope.  I went to the  urlLink Atlanta area crafting group  last week, which was a blast.  Our felt flowers were gorgeous.  Of course, the self-adhesive pin-backs didn't stand the test of time; it goes to show that no matter what, there are always things that require you to Do-It-Yourself.  Ya know how sometimes when you want to do something, you end up talking about doing it for a long time?  I know my student teaching just ended, so I should be spent.  But I'm not!  I can't wait to have my own class and start the whole she-bang.  I love talking about it though!  I love pondering all the hows and what-ifs!  I just can't wait for it to start!  There is some trepidation of course, but mostly eagerness and excitement.  Oh, and we have a writing group starting.  Yippee! Here's a stream of consciousness, freewrite:  prove the rape jump in what you have to work with the rotten deal the occasion of meeting a deceptive girl who smiles who frowns not just with her lips but with her voice collect the quiet evidence scrapings of fingernails swabbings everything else in the wind

      When I was 5 years old, my mother tried for the last time to become a nationalized U.S. citizen.  She had tried twice before and failed.  She was not fluent in the English language, so you can imagine the problems she had - not being able to remember who Abraham Lincoln was or memorizing the opening to the Bill of Rights.  Her attempts to improve her literacy left her feeling frustrated and, frankly, too old to be starting a new language.  It was on this trip that I remember waiting hours in the government waiting room, which was located high up in a building in downtown Atlanta; my mother came out from her  urlLink test  and was angry.  It was on her face, red and blooming.  She was angry, but also ashamed.  She felt powerless, countryless, rejected, silenced.  It was a strange thing for me to feel from my mother at such a young age.  I wanted to wrap my body around hers and heal her hurt.  She had already been through so much, and here was this hoop jumping that made her feel like a clown.  Nevertheless, my mother continued to see hope and idealism in the smiling face of folks like Ronald Reagan and George Bush.  She wanted to be a part of their America - not wanting to realize that she never would be, that to them she was a foreign devil.  My mother would root for Americans during the Olympics, except when a South Korean was competing.  If she thought for one moment that the two were exclusionary, that you had to leave your native culture behind in order to be truly accepted in America, she would have left this country years ago.  Fortunately, America is a kind of salad bowl, and she has been able to thrive in the local Korean-American community.  She probably goes days without having to speak a word of English.  If she were to sit in on some of my theory classes this semester, she would probably sit back and laugh.  She sits on the edge of the binary - between West and East, black and white, American and non-American - and laughs, no longer willing to play the clown or devil.

      What does it mean to be "politically correct"?  A lot of people think this means that there is a right and a wrong way to say something - usually a way to label a group of people.  For instance, people in wheelchairs used to be called handicapped.  Now they're called "differently-abled" or "physically-challenged."  Instead of black, we have the term African American (sometimes hyphen, sometimes no hypen).  As identity politics have become topics around the world, we needed language to express the various experiences and ideologies that emerged.  The set of words and terms we use are a way of showing respect and giving consideration to previously or currently marginalized or oppressed peoples.  But when did "politically correct" start being applied to historically privileged groups?  For example, a friend of mine was recently chastised for calling a group of Christian fundamentalists "fascists."  It was pointed out that if you can't call the disenfranchised folks names, you shouldn't be calling names at all.  You shouldn't make generalized statements against white people, the upper class, or even zealous religious folks.  This was the claim being made.  I believe in a power structure.  I believe that the rich and powerful (about 1% of the population) control the rest of us - the other 98-99%.  There are various systems in place to ensure the power flows in one direction - capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy.  Somewhere along the way, as some academics and literary types started using language to subvert this power - to claim their own authority and identity - some people got confused.  Instead of actually changing power relationships, they could hide their racism, sexism, and class privilege by using the right words.  This is how "politically correct" was born.  And that is exactly why it is wrong.  On the other side of the coin, there are people out there who relish in their ability to be politically "incorrect."  This makes me mad in a different way.  If you have racist thoughts, certainly, just say them, so I know where we stand.  But don't hide behind some notion that you're "keeping it real" by defying political correctness.  You're just an idiot.  I hate capitalism.  I hate patriarchy.  I hate racism.  Though I recognize my own part in these systems, I will not sit silently or hold my tongue when I see the cold-hearted perpetrators of violence, exploitation, or other atrocities.  When a specific group of Christian fundamentalists (in a specific town, and perhaps in a specific church) start banning Harry Potter books or organizing Pro-Life demonstrations outside of abortion clinics, I have no problem calling them fascists.  If I were to use the term hearing-impaired instead of deaf, it would not be because it was "politically correct."  It would simply be my way of showing respect and giving dignity to a group of people with diverse histories and issues.  Do I want to give this same respect to sexist, racist, capitalist pigs?  No, not really.

      The Japanese beetle seems to be the topic of conversation lately, with homeowners and apartment dwellers alike.  If you're not talking about it, you've probably at least noticed their growing numbers lately.  They do seem to be everywhere, stuck to walls, eating up plant beds, or dead on their backs.  Even my dogs have noticed the presence of this bug; luckily, they're not into eating them.  I decided to look up the Japanese beetle on  urlLink google .  Basically, I wanted to know what the fuss was about, and why it was called a "Japanese" beetle.  My boyfriend informs me that I always have favored things "Asian" - whether they are people, customs, or foods.  I'm prejudiced towards them, he thinks.  Well, I disagree sometimes.  Other times, I'm guilty as charged.  So, as expected, the Japanese beetle is supposedly from Japan.  I wonder what the Japanese have to say about it?  The problem of course was this "foreign invader," as one website called it, was brought to the US (probably through int'l trade) without its "natural enemies."  So it has flourished and taken everyone's broad-leafed plants with it.  I'm not really suggesting that the Japanese beetle is a way to continue to slander Asians and specifically incite hatred of the Japanese.  I'll let our own history speak for itself on that matter.  For instance, in WWII, why was it necessary to continue to firebomb and drop atomic bombs on Japan even though they were near surrender?  Why weren't the Nazis nuked?  Why weren't German-Americans put into concentration camps in addition to Japanese-Americans?  Good questions.  On a similar note, why is it okay to laugh at a guy like William Hong.  You know, the Asian American Idol guy - who sings "She Bangs."  Hong himself was very humble about the whole thing, admitting that he couldn't sing very well and that he didn't expect fame.  Meanwhile, non-Asian Americans were content to fake their enthusiasm, while pointing and laughing backstage.  He was a joke to them, as Asian American males have been for centuries, whether they wore the traditional queue (hair braid) or were "fresh off the boat."  I couldn't help thinking about my brother, who might see William Hong on television, what millions of Americans thought he was really like, and feel a 100% disconnect.    If you're demeaned as a human being - turned into an object of derision and jest - it becomes that much easier to ignore crimes and assaults against you.  It's in that way that we celebrate the victories of WWII instead of our involvement in its various atrocities.  It's in this tradition that we continue to march, as long as we are blind to our own guilt.

      Sometimes, I wish for plain honesty.  Don't say you believe in freedom of thought when you really think that one particular idea is the best.  Don't say you believe in freedom of expression when you characterize differences in opinions as "crazy" or "silly."  I can only imagine that your self-righteousness is based on your experience of validation from many other people.  I know for myself that I have rarely been validated and am never sure where I stand with others. You think your experiences are the norm.  You are so sure that your ideas are correct, right, divine, and unprejudiced.  You think you are so liberal.  You think you are doing me a favor by letting me be here.  You think you are educating me by telling me what the text means.  You think you are enlightening me with the texts of your own cultural heritage and legacy.  You think this legacy is correct, right, divine, and unprejudiced.  You assume I won't fight back.  You assume that I won't question you.  You assume I don't know anything, especially about you.  You think that my knowledge is less - less important, less correct, less widespread.  You think that I want your texts, that I need your texts.  You think that I am an empty vessel waiting to be filled with the right ideas.  You think my ideas are primitive and unsophisticated.  You see me as a threat, even as you see me as powerless.  You see me as something to be tamed, even as you think I am incapable of being your equal.  You see my quest for knowledge as an appeal to you, as if I were on my knees.  My mother had never heard of Jesus before the 1980s.  She certainly didn't believe in him until 1989, when she sent me to Catholic Sunday school.  But our spiritual life wasn't empty, it wasn't a vacuum that needed to be filled by Western religion.  My mother raised me in the Confusion tradition, sprinkled with some Buddhist afterthoughts.  It was a theology based on ancestry and family-centered piety.  It doesn't even operate the way Western (re:Christian) religions do.  My world view was born from this early introduction to korean religion - from which I will never escape.  I will always think about certain stories and myths - which you may have never heard of - when reading different texts and experiencing different things.  My mother's later joining of Christian churches was an attempt at Westernizing or Americanizing herself and me.  Maybe the national religion in the US should be Christianity.  And the national language should be English.  In this way, I wouldn't feel so victimized in being forced to understand, cope, and, in some ways, believe in your religion.  I wouldn't feel so foolish for wanting to speak in another tongue.  Millions of people could quietly slip back over the borders, into their "boats," and on planes - back to their countries of origin.  You wouldn't need to sigh about all the brown faces and brown neighborhoods crowding you.  You wouldn't need to pace and fret about inclusion and the corruption of the literary canon.  Everything would be consensual, everything would be agreed upon.    You are who you are.  I am who I am.  And at every moment that changes.  Change doesn't  just  happen, though.  You have to make change.  I'm committed to making it, because it's all I can do to survive.  It's the only way this square is fitting into a round hole, by changing the rules, by shaking the boat, by standing in your face.  If you don't like it, get out of the way.

      Being a student is hard.  I'll try to remember that when I'm teaching this fall.  It's hard to have the rug pulled out from underneath you, to have "Truth" ground into the dust, and left with pieces and swirls and 7 letter words.  I hate having to think all the time.  I have been a student of theory for a long time, and I do think of myself as an intelligent person.  But I am tired.  My grey matter is tired.  It's looking pale.  I find myself searching for those thoughtless activities and quiet moments.  In a house with 5 dogs, that's hard to do.  The licks are aplenty but so are the whines and the barks.  Their running down the hall is thunderous.  Conclusions I've made so far this semester: If everything in the universe is composed of the same matter, then all humans are the same.  But then again, everyone has different perceptions, experiences, and interactions with the world.  Thus we are all different.  The fact that there is no truth (capital T), is perhaps the only truth (little t).  There is no "actual" anything.  Language is a construction.  Well, everything is a construction.  Every reading is a mis-reading.  Nationhood is a myth.  Identity is a myth.  We aren't even born human.  And I wonder why I'm tired?

      The Hill  It is sometime since I have been to what it was had once turned me backwards, and made my head into a cruel instrument.  It is simple to confess.  Then done, to walk away, walk away, to come again.  But that form, I must answer is dead in me, completely, and I will not allow it to reappear --  Saith perversity, the willful, the magnanimous cruelty, which is in me like a hill.  - Robert Creeley  I don't know anything about this poet or this poem.  I was sitting in the graduate studies lounge at my college and picked up a collection of poems from the shelf.  This was the first one that appeared to me.  It reminds me of a lot of discussions I have been having today - with classmates and new friends - about language, social structures, identity, mental disorders, etc.    Life is like swimming.  I'm lucky if I get to bob on the surface.  Some are able to walk on water.  Some of us are still drowning half of the time.  Please don't make life any more of a struggle than it already is, by throwing stones and spitting at people.  I don't think this is simplistic, I think it's humanistic.

      Well, today was my day to do "nothing." I can't really say if anything got done today.  I got lots of licks from the puppies - who I am getting very attached to - and popped some popcorn.  Other than that, the only other thing I did was make some  urlLink button coasters , which I have been pondering for a while.  Yep, I'm crafty.  But, otherwise, didn't do any school work.  Didn't read any books, didn't write any papers.  Just cooling off.  Justing settling in, into my own skin.  Thought about drinking some plum wine.  But it's Sunday, and we're in the Bible belt.  Made a batch of sweet tea instead.  No aspartame.  Just good ole refined white sugar.  Yumm.

      I recently joined a writing group with some classmates and local college folks.  Our first activity was a freewrite, which made my hand tired and really surprised me.  I started with an image that was framed on the wall, and it took me somewhere totally different. I didn't know that I had these thoughts in my head.  It  was  a  free  write.  I can't wait to pick up some of the ideas and create something new.  chinese faces staring back reflection invisible identity hand put over mouth kind of silent obedient like a dog that comes when called otherwise tossed out and left behind in some field not wide open but surrounded by dangers everywhere and if there were a way to hand over power to hand over these precious lives to the caring hands of another it would be done but sometimes there is no turning back time there is no "actual" to return to no home not even a house anymore it was not the bone house of your dreams it was milky and putrid grey in a soup of rain and washed up desires night after night of wondering what to do if the feelings of so and so mean more than the very delicate egg you carry around inside of yourself and you try to remember dialectics, post-modernism, post-Marxism, but those are only an approximation of what is really happening to you the rainwater filling up the room and it's up to your knees soon up to your waist what will you do when your heart gets sunk in that tepid water will you scream but what will you do when your mouth gets full of fluid and even breathing is no option you won't runaway you stay and try to float to swim to live life as if you always knew it was a flooded damn house or falling building or bullet from a gun you should have known that you dreamt and felt it why are you surprised

      I read the book  Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee  a few years ago, as part of a Native American history class I was taking.  If you haven't ever read the book, it's a very interesting story, cataloging the genocide and decimation of many Western and Midwestern Native American tribes during the 19th and 20th centuries.  The title comes from a request by Crazy Horse, a heroic figure from the Sioux tribe.  He had asked that after his death his body be buried at Wounded Knee, the site of a deadly massacre of Sioux men, women, and children by U.S. military forces.  In response to the massacre, Crazy Horse led a devasting, guerrilla style attack on the troops.  He was able to corner Custer in the desert and give him his deserved death. (Yep, there was no heroic "last stand.")  Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is also located in Wounded Knee, SD, where the famous shootout of 1975 happened, for which  urlLink Leonard Peltier  is serving two life sentences. But of course we know there was no justice for the Native American, not then and not now.  I read an article recently that said that the U.S. government is looking for Crazy Horse's bones.  Of course, to put them into a museum.  Thinking of the state of the world today, I cannot help but to feel hopeless and angry.  I've studied Marxism and other political theories for a long time, but I can't say that I'm any closer to knowing what will happen or how.  I kinda have more of a grasp of what is happening and what is "wrong" in our society, but not how to convince others of it.  I feel like even the "liberal," "progressive," or "radical" community is divided - that real change seems unattainable.  We can only take baby steps in having our voices heard.  And the people who are listening are not convinced, have other agendas, or totally refute what we say.  A lot of movies and films that I've seen lately have only added to my hopeless, angry, and doomsday perspective.  From  The Fog of War  to  Supersize Me  to  The Day After Tomorrow , I am convinced that the human race is irredeemable.  There will always be war, greed, misinformation, miscommunication, misunderstandings, and a lack of human compassion.  Our complacency is disgusting - that we continue to drive SUVs and pollute our water, while at the same time uneducating our populations and degrading our cultures.  What has the world come to?  This is what makes me turn inward.  To poetry, knitting, and my loved ones.  The Indigo Girls say,  If we leave a legacy, it's that we loved each other well .  This is my measuring stick for personal strength.  I don't want to lose any more hope.  Looking around at the delicate hues of a natural landscape, absorbing the miracle of chihuahua puppies, and laughing deep down in my gut - these things keep me going.  Hope is not eternal, but temporary, like the fragrance of a flower or fruit.  Just as despair is not permanent.

         So, Rahim really scared me one night.  He told me about a documentary he saw that mentioned that aspartame, a chemical ingredient in some food products, is potentially deadly.  What food products? I asked.  Well, it's an ingredient in Diet Coke, first of all.  I'm still debating the issue with myself.  I know that these fake chemical additives are having some effect on my body.  What substance that you ingest doesn't?  As a person that already experiences a lot of medical problems, including chronic kidney stones, salivary gland stones, ovarian cysts and tumors, it wouldn't help to continue consuming something that is proven to cause medical problems.  I only wonder what are the reliable sources?  Trusting blindly in the FDA, which endorses tomatoes that have been genetically altered with fish genes, well, it's just not smart.  That's fishy.  A lot of internet sources could be considered "hoax" or unreliable - but what do they have to gain? They aren't promoting a different beverage product.  Usually they are just promoting that you drink more water.  As a believer in an American corporate fascism - in my vision of the future, everything is owned and controlled by US Corp - I don't easily swallow (pun intended) what I'm told by the government or big corporations.  I like to know all the angles.  In the interest of all public knowledge, I'm gonna put some of the links I've visited up so that you can decide.     urlLink Aspartame Information Center   urlLink Aspartame Toxicity Info Center   urlLink Aspartame Consumer Safety Network   P.S. Splenda, perhaps, isn't splendid, after all...

         I've been confused for many ethnicities and national origins.  You name it, I've been called it.  From Pakistani to Native American to French, I'm never amazed anymore by what people think I "am."  But here is one of the weirdest stories:  I used to work at Grady Hospital.  If you know the area, you know that homeless and poor folk hang around there.  It's routine to be panhandled on your way to work or to your car.  You learn to be polite, whether you give anyone change or not.  Well, one night, a black man approached me.  He appeared to be the average panhandler.  Let me also add that he didn't appear immediately to look Latino or Caribbean; he seemed to be a normal black American.  But when he asked me for change, he did so in Spanish.    Let me repeat - he panhandled me in Spanish.  He must have sized me up as he approached me.  It took a lot of savvy to plot out different panhandling strategies, and to appeal to each person in a particularly sensitive way.  Except, he blew it with me.  He would have been better off asking in English.  I've never been the sort to dodge something with language.  I wish I could pretend to not speak English in order to confuse or hide from someone.  "I so sorry.  Me no speakee Engleesh."  But I can't.  And I haven't.  More often than not, I've served as an interpreter for others, like my mom.  Especially as children, we look up to adults to take on the role of interacting with society.  But my brother and I were always the ones to fill out the school forms and handle conferences with teachers.  So I've never had the opportunity to take "proper" English for granted.  It was a learned survival strategy.     A good example of this stands out in my mind.  My mom has always had difficulty with our various next door neighbors.  Where they live now is no exception.  The little white kids that live there would literally terrorize my mom - stealing bags of dog food from our carport, throwing eggs on our car, spitting in the mail box.  One day she decided to go talk to their mother.  I went over with her, reluctantly, my face probably 9 shades of red.  Despite my presence, my mom decided to do most of the talking, and most of it was in angry Korean.  Let me just say that the discussion did not go well.  The cross-eyed blonde lady next door thought her kids were just angels.  Little angels.  As we were walking home, my mom was still fuming.  I told her the lady didn't understand what my mother was saying.  My mother insisted, in Korean, "How can she not understand?"  So even though the guy panhandled me in Spanish, maybe the point is not his misidentification of me.  Maybe the point is that I actually do know enough Spanish and about human communication to understand what he meant.  As a post script, I was telling this story to Rahim and his response to my list of mistaken racial identities was: "It's because you're so pretty."  No wonder I love him.

      Have you ever had a job that you loved?  I haven't until now.  I love my job as a writing tutor!  Hopefully this means I will love my job as a middle school teacher too.  We'll see.  The reason I love my job - today, at least - is because of being able to interact and help other people, from various backgrounds and experiences.  Early in the day, I help a student with a personal narrative for her class. She wrote about her grandfather's experience as a soldier in World War II.  It's not the typical story you hear about, though.  Her grandfather was forced to join the royal British army in Kenya.  They were forced to fight for and pledge their loyalty to the colonial forces, though they were not properly trained, paid, fed, or promoted.  It is an immensely well written piece, that really conveys the injustice her grandfather endured and survived.  I help the student with the basic grammar and syntactical issues, but the power of her words blow me away.  The next student I go on to help is an immigrant from Bosnia.  He immediately recognizes my last name as being Polish; he explains that Poland is very close to where he is from.  He then goes on to guess that I am racially mixed, and even identifies correctly that my mother is Korean.  I ask him how he could possibly know, and he responds by asking me, "How do you know that I'm not really Russian?" It is an enigmatic question to me, but speaks to that part of me that knows that there are many diasporas in the world, and perhaps he is alluding to a Russian one into Eastern Europe.  He knows how to say "thank you" in Korean.  I respond by saying "no problem."  Finally, another student I work with requests assistance on a paper she is writing arguing that the current American welfare system is inadequate, particularly for single mothers.  She talks about her personal experiences with the welfare system, and the pitfalls and limitations of the system.  She has so many ideas that she is having problems getting them into her paper.  How can a handful of words encapsulate her argument?  Above all, it is inspiring to see that classroom assignments can spark such interest and debate.    The world is a funny place.  The borders are becoming unclear, particularly the borders between human beings.  I hope this trend continues, not in the spread of global capital, but of knowledge of the multiplicity in the human experience.

       As an artist I come to sing, but as a citizen, I will always speak for peace, and no one can silence me in this.  - Paul Robeson    I wrote this in one of my classes in response to this  urlLink photograph . I wanted to share it here.  And I'd like to add "warmongering" as another reason why I don't like people.  War is a pile of bodies - not alive, not dead, not even human anymore - but pounds of flesh.  Collateral damage.  The smiling people standing over the pile are victorious, triumphant, satiated.  This scene has been rehearsed on football fields all over the country - linemen tackling half-backs with the quarterback flat on the bottom.  Except here there isn't the celebratory pouring of gatorade over the coach's head or pops of champagne.  The heads of state will celebrate in November when they get their promotions and raises.  There isn't gatorade in the desert, only sandstorms, secret snapshots, and memories of freedom.

      This is a kind of happy and sad post.  Happy because I love dogs and I want to boast about them.  Sad because we have a puppy overload problem at my house.  Two adult dogs (one of which is not very house trained), and 3 squirming, ultra cute puppies - it makes for a hectic house.  I think Rahim and I have decided to sell 2 of the 3 puppies.  It's so sad, which left me in a depressed funk overnight.  But it's probably the best thing to do.  In any case, selling the puppies is one way of spreading chihuahua love.  That's how we got Assata and Ernesto, whom we love very much.  We can possibly be bringing joy and love into the lives of others.  That's the hope.  10 things I love about chihuahuas (and dogs in general):  10. wagging tails 9. big eyes that see things 8. big ears that listen 7. big hearts that love 6. curiosity 5. burrowing in blankets 4. rolling over for stomach rubs 3. attentive licking of faces 2. kisses 1. sitting on laps     P.S. Assata hates wearing any of the sweaters I make for her so I rarely make her wear them.  I may love dogs, but I'm not crazy.

      You know that 80s song? "I'm comin' out... I want the world to know... I'm gonna let it show...."  I felt like I had my own little coming out today.  I "came out" to my classmates that I am biracial (Asian and white).  It's not been something that I hide from people, but throughout the course of the program I have just never found the opportunity to share my identity.  It's not usually something you tell a person in everyday conversation, nor is it something you can wear on your clothing.  We had been so busy with classes and student teaching that we never really had much of a chance to get to know one another.  I wish I could have worn a t-shirt that said, "I am bi-racial.  I am probably not of the ethnicity that you think."  But then again, I didn't want to make any announcements.  I was bothered by the idea that some people might consider me to be "white" - which carries a lot of baggage, historically, socially, and politically.  But more often than not, I did not want people to think that "white" was something that could define me.  Yeah, I do have quite a few white friends and the term "white" does not define all that they are, but it does define a part of them.  As it does a part of me.  I guess, what I am trying to say is that I did not want the "white" to block out the other part - the Asian, the Korean.  I grew up in a household where we spoke a mixture of Korean and English, where we ate foods from both cultures, and lived with both cultures.  I learned to "code switch" - as learned academics call it - between my two worlds - the school world and my home world.  The school world was one immersed in white suburban culture.  My home world was a mixture of taking shoes off at the door, eating white rice at every meal, and negotiating language between my parents.  My favorite foods are "gimpop" (Korean sushi), "chopjae" (rice noodles and veggies) "jajiangmin" (buckwheat noodles with black bean sauce) and miso soup (which I hope you're familiar with).  It's not that I would deny my "white" ancestry.  I like the fact that my grandparents (who are now deceased) were from Germany and Poland.  My grandfather was a Jew, who managed to leave Poland before Hilter's reign of terror.  Of course, he sacrificed his religion.  But his Catholic bride gave him a bountiful legacy with 13 children, including my father.  I love that my last name is unique and usually inspires questions of geography.  But sometimes I wish my name were something more Asian - like Lee or Kim or Zhang.  Names are one way of representing identity.  My mother's maiden name is Choe (pronounced like the name Chet, without the "t"), but now we're all Jerzaks.  My boyfriend has asked me if I will change my last name to his when we get married.  I've tossed the idea around in my mind, very much like a worn softball between my hands.  I like my name, my whole name, and the way it rolls off of the tongue.  The way my "married" name sounds is short and abbreviated, like the month of February.  Maybe I would get used to it, like other changes in an adult's life, but I don't know.  Part of me wants to assert my feminism and keep my "maiden" name (maiden must refer to my "virginal" state prior to marriage).  But if you trace any name back, you find it's always a man's name.  My name is from my father, while my mother's name is from her father, and so on.  What happened to all of the women's names?  Well, that was a digression.  Back to the coming out - I was very active in "identity politics" in college. I got so much out of it, not just a better sense of self and political views, but also a lot of friends.  Most people think being biracial is confusing or difficult - but I have found that the problem usually lies with the "whole" race people.  People privilege "whole" race over multiplicity, without considering their own ancestry in detail and the mixed unions that birthed generations.  I came to understand my own identity by examining my own experiences growing up and within my family, as we all do in our own families and lives.  My brother is "full-blooded" Korean, having a different father than me and also being born in Korea.  Though we do not share every experience, we share most of our growing up together.  So what makes him more "Korean" than me? Alongside our Korean culture, we both grew up listening to Michael Jackson, drinking Coca-cola, and speaking English.  One of us grew up to be a pharmacist, drive a SUV, listen to Brittney Spears, and pine over eyelid surgery.  The other grew up to question authority, to study Marxism and creative writing, to listen to Radiohead, and plan a career that would make a difference/change the system.  Which one of us is more American? which one is having the identity crisis?

      Oh, the best of news!  We found a house to rent in Decatur!  It's oh so lovely - hardwood floors, front deck, and vintage flavor!  If and when I can get a picture of it, I'll post it.  In the meantime, click  urlLink here  to see these nifty signs we got at a local thrift store.  They're painted on both sides, with chains to hang them, so you can point them in different directions.  They're the perfect adornment to what will be our funkadelic, ecletic, retro home.

      Why is it called a "pet" peeve anyway? Is it something that you nurture and care after, which accompanies you throughout your life - like a dear friend?  Peeve - n. A vexation; a grievance.  Here is a list of things that have been annoying me lately about  people .  These things make me prefer animals - especially my chihuahua friends (aka pets) - to the company of human bipeds.   - hunting for doves - hosting parties/events that don't provide vegetarian options - animal neglect and cruelty - destroying the environment for short term profit - yelling, shouting, and pounding of fists - laughing at others - talking rudely about others behind their backs - being fake (especially fakely friendly) - making assumptions about me (especially about my race or my beliefs) - pushing boundaries - not recycling - not liking books - wishing me a happy Easter or Christmas - not liking animals - people who hit each other - being against downloading MP3s - SUV drivers (and makers) - not liking to tip

      After today's busy day:  yelled at by fellow student at 9 am post-colonial literary theory at 11 am kevin kline movie at 12:30 and the legal tangle of current day education at 3 pm  I needed a time-out.  The good kind.  After a wonderfully healthy dinner, Rahim and I had an interesting, impromptu religious discussion.  You know, is there a god? Does god care about us humans? How do we celebrate and stand in awe of god/creation, without necessarily "worshipping"?  We didn't come to any conclusions.  I may actually be more confused than before.  But I feel closer to Rahim, like we may be "soulmates" after all, if souls actually exist....  I got this cool book at a used book store, that I'd like to quote here -  Prose and Poetry from the Old Testament , edited by J.F. Fullington.  FYI, I haven't ever read the Bible cover to cover, so a lot of this stuff was unfamiliar to me.  Especially since it's from the Old Testament. ********************************************************************  To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding; To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and judgement and equity; To give subtility to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion: That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels: To understand a proverb, and a figure; The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.  The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.  - Book of Proverbs

      There are rules for a reason, right?  I comfort myself with this statement, after I have felt guilty about being so neurotic about grammar, after I have heard or read someone say something totally "wrong."  In class today, a fellow student asked, "What's the difference?" We were talking about using who versus whom.  So, yeah, what's the difference?  My weak and meek answer: Because there are rules.  Yes, rules change over time.  Language changes over time.  But the rules of the moment still exist, now.  Some people are content to bend or break the rules.  Over the last few months or years, I have learned - the hard way - that being "right" is not always the most important thing.  Being right can get you into as much trouble as being "wrong" can in another situation.  Some people are okay with letting their cell phones ring in the movie theatres.  I'm not.  I imagine crawling over the seats and swiping at them, like a wild cat.  Some people are okay with crossing the street without a crosswalk or signal.  They cross boldly as if they own the roads and can will cars to stop.  I cross hesitantly and look for white lines against grey to protect me.  Here's where it gets sticky: I've always been a fan of the tv show Law & Order.  I am certainly not a big fan of the legal system (or the "justice" system) and the prison system.  I see many flaws and lost souls.  Yet, one of my favorite pasttimes is to sit back with some L&O.  My favorite episodes are when the laws are questioned, when the prosecution loses, or the guilt is unclear.  Sometimes I root for the bad guys. Maybe I'm comforted by the fact that at least there are rules.  But grammar rules?  They are something I've been programmed with, like my social security number or something.  Like remembering to thank people and say "excuse me."  Like remembering not to litter.  The difference is the type of world we live in - one where "what" we say is as important as "how" we say it.  A world where communication takes some grace, if not a lot of effort.

Hey, as long as it was not on the front, I was okay with it.  So, who wants one?  Oh yeah, the black mark was to cover up my phone number.  Not everything is public, eh?

          The picture is a bit blurry, but it's about as still as I could stand, just inches away from this spider's web.  There are dozens like it around our front deck and the side of the house.  No matter how much we spray, they keep coming back.  Overnight, it seems, these spinners are at work at another elaborate creation.  I don't mind their housekeeping so much, but it's their bite that I fear.  Too bad cigarette smoke doesn't thwart spiders the way it does mosquitos.  Summer has been itchy so far.

           Aside from the usual stress of moving from a 3rd story apartment, in the middle of the summer, I was also experiencing a lot of anxiety and frustration on the big moving day.&nbsp; I was very stressed,&nbsp;to say the least.&nbsp; After discovering that my U-haul reservation happened to be at a private 'dealer' of some sketchy nature (some are liquor stores, others are storage facilities), Rahim and I were driving frantically around the city trying to grab another truck somewhere else.&nbsp; There just happened to be a public storage business just down the street from us, with plenty o' U-hauls parked out front.&nbsp; Inside, however, was one lone teenage boy, attending to the customers.&nbsp; There were 2 people in line already.&nbsp; I got into line and proceeded to wait.   All of us have become more or less&nbsp;accustomed to the rigors of modern American society - whether you're at a supermarket, an amusement park, or on the internet.&nbsp; There's a lot of waiting involved.&nbsp; Let me just say, I'm not a very good wait-er.&nbsp; I hate waiting.&nbsp; I have cried a few times after waiting too long - usually out of anger.&nbsp; Some people have shorter tolerances for waiting than I do - like Rahim, who will get up and leave a restaurant if he's waited too long for service.&nbsp; I usually just take it, and complain about it later.   So, I waited in this particular line, on Saturday morning, for about 12 minutes before I was even given a hello.&nbsp; Urgh, was I pissed!&nbsp; All I wanted to know was if a truck was available.&nbsp; I asked, and the teenage boy answered.&nbsp; He actually hooed and hawed about it for a few seconds and thumbed around on his computer a bit, before he spit out a heavy, floor-thudding "no."&nbsp; Well, enough of my time was wasted.&nbsp; I bolted, not wanting to rip his head from his puny little neck with my bare teeth.&nbsp; I was fuming.&nbsp; All I could think was, "12 minutes! 12 minutes!"   Let me back up a bit.&nbsp; About 6 minutes before I reached the head of the line, the teenage boy asks the customer before him&nbsp;for his new address, for billing purposes or whatever.&nbsp; The man starts telling him the address - street number, street name, city, zip... then the teenage boy interrupts, "What's the name of your city? Avondale Estates? What kinda name is that?"&nbsp; The rest of us in the room give a group guffaw.&nbsp; Are you kidding?&nbsp; The building we are standing in is probably less than a half-mile from Avondale Estates, and the kid doesn't even know it exists!&nbsp; It is literally only 2 to 3 blocks away and this teenage boy is too oblivious!&nbsp; He insists in his ignorance, however, and asks, "Why would there be a small town in the middle of the city?"&nbsp; I was about to fall out.&nbsp; Hello? We are standing in the city of Decatur! Which is its own county, with its own utilities and even school district.&nbsp; It's surrounded on all sides by Dekalb county and neighbors various small cities and communities.&nbsp; This kid doesn't even know he lives in a metropolis!   You suck, you teenage boy.&nbsp; You and your 12 minute&nbsp;wait!

      I know I've been neglecting my blog lately, but I've been&nbsp;busy packing and moving.&nbsp; We're moving this weekend, and, boy, do we have a lot left to do!   In other news, I did finish all of my work for my graduate program.&nbsp; But... it doesn't really feel like it's over.&nbsp; I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop, or something.&nbsp; Maybe it's the move, maybe it's the clutter in my house, maybe it's the uncertainty of my grades.&nbsp; I don't know.   I do know that this last semester really kicked my butt.&nbsp; I started smoking (one to two cigarettes a day), started eating Krispy Kreme donuts every time I stopped to get gas, stopped knitting, and neglected my chihuahuas (definite lack of lap time).&nbsp; Is graduate school supposed to be this hard?   I purposefully skipped the Exit Interview with the program director.&nbsp; I don't think she wants to know what I have to say.&nbsp; I'm sure, especially since she's retiring, that she doesn't want to know that I feel like I overpaid for a program that has more reputation than guts.&nbsp; I'm grateful for that reputation, otherwise I'd be really pissed.&nbsp; My main problems&nbsp;in the last year and a half have been with professors in the education department - their relative incompetence, unprofessionalism, and lack of accountability.&nbsp; By the end of last Fall semester, I was considering transferring to Emory or GA State... but wanted to just get the damn thing over with.&nbsp; And now it is.   This last semester was very hard, mostly for internal and personal reasons probably.&nbsp; I was so ready for school to be over, for drama to be over, for life to go on.&nbsp; I was ready for a paycheck, not a loan check.&nbsp; I was ready for summer days, basking in the sun, with chihuahuas running to and fro, and tofu pups heating on the grill.&nbsp; Instead, I was on an emotional&nbsp;and mental roller coaster, with&nbsp;some very&nbsp;unhappy and&nbsp;mentally deranged folks.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least now, the ride has ended.   I am happy to have made some great friends, for otherwise I would have surely been&nbsp;lost.&nbsp; Going to work now, as a middle school teacher, is that much more of a relief and joy.&nbsp; Congratulations to us all, for surviving, and moving forward.

           I found this image about 3 years ago and thought it was perfect for some skin art.&nbsp; Tattoo, that is.&nbsp; Of course, I was nervous for a long time about it and never actually went to do it.&nbsp; After my recent birthday, reflections on life, and continuing health problems, I feel like grabbing life by the balls (or horns).&nbsp; Once I finish writing my last 10 page research paper and taking my last absurd English language final, off I go to the tattoo parlor. &nbsp; The tattoo only shows on the surface what is already imprinted inside of me.&nbsp; It could be worse; it could be be an anchor, naked woman, or cartoon character.&nbsp; But let me know if you see any cute chihuahua graphics out there.

      I had a horrible night last night, after the wonderful birthday celebration at school.  On the way home from work, I decided to call my mom, since I hadn't talked to her yet that day, and probably for the last month or so.  First, I accidentally called my dad at work, which ended up being a good surprise.  He is a nice guy.  He asked how I was doing and where I would be working soon.  He wished me a happy birthday.  So, then I called my mom and from word one it was grief.  I'll just make a list of some of the things she said:  - I'm a bad daughter - I haven't called in over a month and I didn't call on Mother's Day - I've never given her anything for her birthday or celebrated her in a real way - She thinks I never want to come home again, that I've been on vacation the last two months - She's mad about Mother's Day and that's why she won't be giving me a birthday present - She's mad about Mother's Day but she has already forgiven me about that - Why don't I talk to my brother? - I should call my brother because he's lonely and I only have one brother - Whatever my brother has done, I should forgive him, because that's the way boys are - If I don't talk to my brother anymore, then she won't talk to me anymore - I cried too much growing up - She says she knows me and knows that I cry a lot for no reason - If anything was wrong about my childhood and young adulthood, it was my fault - I was bad - She did so much for me and I am ungrateful - She can't believe she raised such an "ugly" person - The only way parents can like their children is if they are "pretty" and "nice" (rough Korean translation) - Why do I act so "ugly?"  I don't even think that includes everything, but it does hit all the high points of our lovely conversation.  The phone call was less than 10 minutes, but it was jam-packed with verbal abuse.  Like a word bomb or something, that just ripped me to shreds in seconds.  It is amazing how well I have survived her crap.  I have found excellent ways of coping: revolutionary activism, puppy love, crafts, over eating, and smoking.  Um, well, those last two might not be the best ways, but they're on the list right now.  Lots of medication too.  If you're wondering, I don't plan on calling her back anymore, at least not anytime soon.  She can go to hell.  The other bad part of the night came around midnight, hours after eating some tasty chinese take-out and red-velvet birthday cake.  I started feeling a little queasy and nauseous.  I layed down but the feeling didn't go away.  I ended up vomitting for the next 2 hours.  I sent Rahim out for some 'Emetrol' - which is basically sugar, but somehow it worked.  I was scared, though, that I needed to go to the ER.  I was diagnosed with an ovarian dermoid 8 months ago and haven't had it removed because I don't have health insurance.  I know, it sounds crazy, but with a job starting next month I thought I could just wait until I had the insurance, rather than accumulating a ten-thousand dollar hospital bill.  But last night, my little house of cards was about to tumble over.  The pain in my abdomen and the vomitting had reached such an extreme that I thought I was screwed - that I would be spending the next 48 hours in the local ER and enduring surgery.  The worst part about being sick is not having access to quality care.  The last time I was in the ER and admitted to the hospital, it was a nightmare.  I already felt bad and it was even worse to wait around for your overworked nurse to check-in on you or your over-worked doctor to return his pages.  With a few papers and projects left to turn in to my graduate program, I hate the feeling of being helpless.  I want to help myself, not give excuses, and always give my best.  But when you're sick, you have to be able to ask for help and lean on others.  Though it may feel like a weakness, it takes a lot of strength.  Thank you to Rahim for holding my hair back as I bent over the toilet and showing me how good and beautiful love could be.  Thank you to Amanda for being a good and caring friend.  Thank you to Lisa Anne for being the best angel a Marxist girl could have.

        Last night I was whining to Rahim about how I was going to be spending my birthday - in class and at work.  By the time I would get home and be able to celebrate, it would be nearly 9 pm, with homework and housework left to do.  No real time for me, on my day.  It's funny how I have this idea about birthdays.  It's not that I expect to sit on a throne and have gifts lavished upon me.  I already live my life, so I know that's not going to happen.  But all I want is a day to do what I want - to sit around in pjs all day and cross stitch and eat donuts.  To go to the zoo and pet animals.  To play computer games until I've lost track of time.  Of course, I do do these things on normal days, when I should probably be doing homework or such.  So, I shouldn't whine about it.  So, this morning I get up, already late for class, and fumble around trying to get to school in one piece.  When I get there (20 minutes late), a birthday cake and presents await me.  Seriously! My friend Amanda was nice enough to get me a pink cake with my name on it.  It was so touching.  At the end of class, they sang 'happy birthday' to me.  What more could a girl want?  When I was little, I was never able to celebrate birthdays in school or with classmates, because I had a summer birthday.  Even when I did celebrate with my family, it was the usual dysfunctional crap.  The birthday story that I always tell is one such example of dysfunctional b.s.  Ever since I could remember, I always had a thing for vanilla frosting.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for chocolate too.  This is why I requested a cake that was chocolate on the inside with vanilla frosting on the outside.  Of course, why would the birthday requests of a little girl be considered in my family?  I ended up with a cake that was majority chocolate frosting with 1/4 to maybe 1/2 vanilla icing.  I was told it wasn't just my cake.  It was everyone's to share, and not everyone liked or wanted vanilla.  Maybe it was my brother who objected to the vanilla, I'm not sure.  All I knew was that even on my birthday, I didn't count.  So now, whenever I can, I try to get a black and white cake - black on the inside and white (vanilla) on the outside.  I want to remind myself of my own self-worth and value, on at least one day of the year.  It's my birthday and I can have vanilla cake if I want to.  All holidays are hard in my family.  The worst are Christmas and Thanksgiving, when we're supposed to pretend that everything is okay and sit around like a peaceful, loving family.  But it was on those nights that more dishes and furniture would be broken.  Knives would come out of drawers and I would lean against the bedroom door to keep the demons out.  Well, the demon had a name, and she had her mark: me.  You would think that one's birthday would be free from this grief, but it isn't.  One year I bought my mother flowers on my birthday - you know, thank you for giving birth to me, I love you... They were in the trash within a few hours.  Words are slippery things and her pain is quick.  More than my anger, I have fear.  I am afraid of what will happen, even at my old (!) age of twenty seven years.  But every birthday that passes is one more year I have survived.  And I know now, more than ever, that every year counts.

       He was, he was in the churchyard. My father was in the first part. He came, he came to my bedroom. But I was asleep. And he woke me up again to say: "Hallelujah! holy is the sound!" I hope, I hope you are tired out. I know, I know there is joy, doubt. And I was asleep. And he woke me up again. And he woke me up again to say: "Hold on to your old ways. Or put off, put off every old face." I know, I know you are changed out. And I hope, I hope you're arranged out. And I'm still asleep, and you woke me up again. And I'm still asleep, and you woke me up to be holy.   Words alone cannot express the beauty of Sufjan Steven's music.  I know it is utterly corny, but it was like he was singing to me.  It reminds me of driving through the flat, solitary winter of Michigan, where I feel the songs emerged.  Snow covering long-fallow fields.  I'm only brave enough to walk into them so far, while small rabbit tracks disappear in the distance.  Sky and earth are the same, distinguished only by thin lines of trees on the field's border.  In the winter, there are countless shades of whites, greys, and browns in the landscape.  The colors inside feel like somber stains.  The notes are low and solemn.  Perhaps sanctified by cold.

      Have you ever wondered where the phrase "goody two shoes" comes from?  Apparently, it mostly likely originates from an old book,  The History of Goody Two Shoes  - written in the 1700s, about a house wife who only has one shoe; of course eventually she gets a second shoe and is so happy that she goes around telling everyone, "Look! Two shoes!"  There is the feminist angle, that "goody" was a nickname for a housewife back then, from "goodwife."  I dunno.  I've always been perceived by others as a "goody two shoes," a "goody goody," or just plain nice.  Ever since I was in kindergarten, this has been true.  I guess I've just always been a nice person.  Even my boyfriend thought so when we first started dating; he thought I was this ultra-nice, virginal type girl.  Just the other day, he used the world "altruistic" to describe me.  Not that I'm not entirely, but somehow "nice" seems to flatten your personality.  The problem is that I have never thought of myself as a nice person really.  I definitely try to be nice, but feel like I am always falling short or failing.  The truth is I have a very negative self-image.  Ever since I was a little girl, my mother has told me that I was bad.  I did things wrong.  I broke things.  I brought bad luck.  My mom is a very sick person, to say it briefly; if I told you all the details of the emotional, mental, and physical abuse of my childhood and young adulthood, we'd both be crying buckets.  You'd understand why I never go home for thanksgiving or christmas, and I avoid phone calls with family members.  You'd wonder why I still live in the same state as them.  For the last five years or so, I've been trying to untangle myself from this web of hurt and self-hate.  It's been hard - a lot of grieving, a lot of mistakes, and a lot of therapy.  I realized yesterday how much work is left undone.  After a stressful few days at school, and receiving much support from classmates and friends, I got to wonder - why is everyone being so nice to me? Why does everyone think that  I  am such a nice person?  Fragile, sensitive - I might agree to those on some days - when I don't want to get out of bed and even sunlight seems dimmed; at other times, I rally against these ideas, wanting to defy the victimization of the past.  But nice? me? Nah.  Then it occurred to me.  I  am  a nice person!  Every now and then I slip into the negative patterns my mom set up for me - mood swings, paranoia, etc. - but when I'm back to "myself," I am a sweet, caring person.  This is the person I want to be - who I always wanted to be, in response to the treatment from my mother, in response to society's ills, in response to other loving people.  So, why am I always beating myself up? Why do I always think that I'm this evil, f*d up person?  It's my inheritance; but luckily, I have been very lucky in love, with Rahim, my beau.  He has shown me that love is beautiful, warm, and nurturing.  Others have shown me through their friendships the value of honesty and compassion.  So the "me" I thought I was - was really the warped sense of self that managed to survive two decades of abuse.  The real "nice" me isn't willing to see herself that way anymore, nor allow herself to be treated in any other way than respectfully.

      I'm tired.  Of course, we all are.  Stress leeches into our pores like cigarette smoke.  Our shoulders are weighed down with tasks, future dilemmas not yet unraveled, and histories opening up like infected sores.  I am trying to process so much, even as my skin is split open and burned by torch light.  Voices call after me like wolf howls and strange bird sounds.  Right now my mind feels like an industrial use toaster - clasping information in its wire hands, spinning it around into the depths of red hot heat, and ejecting a stiff slice of something unrecognizable.  Undigestable.    If you're interested, here are some links I've looked at lately.  I've been wanting to find a picture of  urlLink this  for a long time.  Here is some background  urlLink information  too.  I want to tell you out there, if you didn't know already, that you can be whoever you want to be.  Just try it.  Don't let yourself be the noseless, earless victim.  Don't settle for the role history or society has handed you.  You can decide.  You can decide to speak, where no one has spoken before.  You can decide to listen, to the wild and wondrous cacophony around you.  You can decide to change.

      I used to laugh at people who asked, "Why can't we just get along?"  I thought they were silly, simplistic, and naive.  We live in a complex world, where nothing is simple, and differences are important.  I used to think, "You'll never understand my experiences...."  I used to hate people for their privileges and excesses.  But what would the result of my logic be?  Would I want to live in this fragmented, divided world?  It reminds me of the time a group of us took over the administrative building at my college.  I know, it sounds cliche.  It wasn't the 60s; it was 1999, actually.  We were the first students to take over the building and actually keep the workers out of the building; I guess previously, sit-ins were more symbolic and less destructive.  We did insist that secretaries and such got their full day's pay despite our demonstration.  Anyway, the protest rocked the campus and by the end of the first day, despite final exams and the controversy of the issues involved, the number of students involved exceeded over a hundred people.  We had started with less than a dozen folks.  The take-over began as a protest by students of color (against lack of funding and other political issues), and grew to encompass protests over student rights in general.  Some of the original protesters were dismayed by the change of direction, without realizing that this was the only way (at a majority white school) a large movement would be built.  For myself, it was a revolutionary time. It was the first time that I worked with certain groups of people, whom I had pigeon-holed as non-radical because they were white, or middle-class.  These friendships were what I took away from the whole experience.  I remember the second day, after having been bullied and threatened with expulsion, the core leaders decided to give up the building, having won a few concessions from the administration.  I left, exhausted and excited at the new possibilites - the new alliances, the new coalitions that would be built.  That's how I still feel today.  I am more willing to put compassion before politics, and recognize the flaws in each of us.  I know I get up on my soapbox every now and then, and slip back into defensive mode sometimes.  But I'm just a human being too, a student of this world, trying to make sense and cope.  And sometimes, I too, ask, "When are we going to all get along?"  P.S. I agree with Rahim's theory that "interracial relationships" will solve alot of our problems.  Love knows no bounds.

          Well, please excuse my lack of drawing skills, and perhaps skewed color palette!  I am just trying to do an illustration off the top of my head - to express some of the ideas I've got for our new Retro Dream House.  This pic is of our front deck, which runs along the front of the house, which you can get to from the master bedroom and living room.  I'd like a wood (like teak) or bamboo patio set; I picture coming out in a silk robe in the mornings to sip green tea, while birds chirp in the background.  We went to see the house last night and the first thing I noticed was the utter quiet.  No rumble of cars, no constant zoom of traffic, no inarticulate chatter, or kids crying out.  Just quiet.  Air settling into green spaces.  Oh, I can't wait.  We're moving to the wonderful new house in a matter of weeks and have lots of packing to do, furniture to buy, and decorating to do.  Donations to the Retro fund are accepted!  So is moving help!

      So, I thought I would post my brief thoughts on  urlLink Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11.  I loved it.  I'm already a big fan of Michael Moore's work, starting with  Roger & Me .  Like him, I usually see politics in terms of the underdog, the worker, the little guy (and gal).  This movie confirmed a lot of things I already suspected about George W.'s presidency, 9/11, and the Iraq War.  It painted a gruesome and accurate picture of America as an overly-militarized, imperial force, willing to conquer other nations and societies (in the name of democracy), with the purpose of expanding global capitalism.  The wealth that the US and its corporate friends will gain from their new imperial ventures will result in equal devastation and poverty for the rest of us.  Part of the movie's title of course comes from Ray Bradbury's  Fahrenheit 451 , which is a prediction of a society where books, education, and politics are not a part of everyday life; in fact books are illegal and burned by a squad of firemen.  Life is centered around the pursuit of pleasure.  Looking back at this book now, it is a scary reflection of our society today, which is more focused on appearances and comfort than on education and social betterment.  Here in the South, the summers are long and hot.  Often the humidity is more unbearable than anything else, and rainstorms are usually a welcome relief.  The temperature will be 90 degrees, but it will feel more like 100 degrees.  This is called the heat index - which measures temperature relative to humidity - to estimate the perceived temperature on the human body.  Michael Moore is a kind of heat index for our society and our political health.  The US government (and its media) keeps telling us that everything will be okay, that our political temperature is the weather equivalent of 90 degrees.  Meanwhile, independent voices all around the world are screaming at us, trying to tell us that the world is a much hotter place.  And it's only getting worse.

      Today was day three.  Some of the students loosened up a bit - even I started to loosen up and started to laugh - and most of them remember my name (at least they try to pronounce it).           A list of things that tell me "I've made it, this is my classroom, and these are my students": 1. Got a hug from a student 2. Students ask if they can come to my class instead of another teacher's 3. When I had to leave for a doctor's appt yesterday afternoon, students asked about me 4. Students tell their friends on other teams about me 5. Students ask how they can be one of my 'Star Students' 6. Students ask when they can start borrowing from my lending library 7. Students asked to sit by me at lunch 8. Students wave to me from the bus

      Ferris wheels...   Merry-go-rounds...   And cotton candy, melting fast on your tongue.  I like these traveling amusement parks.  Just don't ride any of the serious rides - the ones named Tornado or Blitz.  Rahim and I believe these rides were invented by Nazis.  There's one that's a train that goes around in a circle, only very very fast.  It goes so fast that one person will be physically forced upon the other person in the little train car.  The ride operators know it's this way because they even tell you before you get on the ride that the heavier person needs to sit in a certain seat.  These rides were invented to torture people, young and old.  Beware.  Riding the merry-go-round and eating cotton candy reminded me of one of my earliest happy memories.  When I was in kindergarten, I went to an economically disadvantaged school.  Of course, my family was economically disadvantaged.  We lived in a trailer park.  I remember that Fall, the school held a carnival, in the evening.  My mom took me.  It was a fun night, filled with music and laughter.  I can look back on it now and understand the motives my teachers had for organizing such an event - to bring some happiness and joy into the lives of their students.  And for me, it was happy. It was my first time eating cotton candy.  People use cotton candy as a kind of corny or cheesy cliche.  Clouds as fluffy as... A pink as light as...  But, with its pink threads melting in my mouth, as fast as a breath, all I can remember is a starry night and my small hand pressed into my mother's.  I wish for such happy times for my students.

      birth dream she knew that I would bloat her and drain blood and water from her belly and never give it back  (what has been soaking in the sea has a sea smell hangs heavy on your back slaps against your skin with that wet sound)  there are things I know by heart if said they might come true the trimmed daffodils dripping water on the tiles your steps heavier and heavier    Here's a poem I found while unpacking a bunch of books.  Amidst the jumble of  Harry Potter ,  Nancy Drew , texts on the Korean War, and a volume of poetry for young adults by Jewel, I came across this small journal that had published one of my poems years ago.  I thumbed through it expecting the poem or my name to flash before me somewhere.  It didn't.  I had to look it up in the table of contents.  And here it is.

      We have a lot of nice doors in the new house.  Unfortunately, almost every single one of them is a reluctant or stubborn door.  Whether I'm trying to open or close them, there is a struggle.  I pull and push, using extremities for balance and body for force against wood.  I lean my ear in for a closer listen, and the voices inside sound as weary as the creaky and stitled swaying of old trees in the wind.  These limbs have carried loads - years like thick rings, the accumulation of dry leaves, and the restless stirrings of young legs.  Even dead, they attempt to stand firm, moving against human intention, human manipulation.  This house has required more of us, who have become so dependent and lazy with our fancy gadgets and modern luxuries.  It takes extra time to flush the toilet, to wash your face with warm water, to do laundry on Sunday mornings - when sleeping late and cleaning up may happen at the same time - and to shut all the doors.  It isn't a hateful or regretful set of circumstances; it's a life that we had forgotten, amidst our school exams and DVDs.  It's the life that requires grass cutting and plant watering.  It's a life that teaches you that wood expands with heat, like our hearts do in a home.
