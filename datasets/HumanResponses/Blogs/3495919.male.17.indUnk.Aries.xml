      I went to a party for a few of my friends' crew (a sport where a team of rowers race boats) team yesterday, and like at most parties I attend where the host is not either myself or one of my friends, about half the people were cool and fun and let me and my friend Boney (whom I invited to tag along) make silly jokes, partake in the festivities, and try to enjoy ourselves... while the other half called us names and made fun of us while playing volleyball not thinking we could hear. Realizing that the people talking about us were the same pencil-necked dweebs who think life is really tough when daddy won't but them a brand new car (thank you, Descendents), quit their after school part time job to focus on weed, and jerk off when they spy on their sisters changing... I wasn't too bothered. However, the party was for not, as it was made pretty clear pretty fast that we weren't gonna' bag us a nematoad (so to speak). So we did what we could to get by for a little bit, such as Boney holding on the the back bumper of my car while on a skateboard and we went for a drive (somehow he managed to kick himself in the back after the skateboard was taken out from under him at 25mph and he had to start running at that speed straight from 0), I laughed at him, of course. We returned to the party for a little while to say goodbye to the people we had come to see, as we were trying to leave some girl asked me to teach her how to skateboard so I gave her a 10 minute lesson or so, and then we took off for bigger and better things. Like utilizing coupons to get a free chicken sandwich at BK, then climb the tree outside it and piss off the top of it in front of the window the manager was eating next to. Went to the videostore and rented Bubba Ho-Tep. A great flick, as any film starring Bruce Campbell is expected to be. Check it out. I don't have to work on Monday, it being Memorial Day, which is fine with me, cause payroll screwed up and accidently gave me a second check worth an extra $163... when I showed my boss he told me "cash it before anyone says anything". Works for me. I'm still waiting to see if I'm gonna' be able to pay my bills at the end of the month after buying that new drumset, though. All in all: goodtimes. I hope everyone has a good Holiday weekend, and remembers to use a strong mind, an active heart, a pair of balls, and communication between the 3 to do what's fun, what's right, and not get hurt doing it. Enjoy yourselves.
