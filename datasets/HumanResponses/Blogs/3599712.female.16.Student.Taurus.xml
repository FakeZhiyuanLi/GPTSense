      Democracy off! I repeat: Democracy off!  What is the bearing of a government which managers are chosen by all population, if most of this population is made of unprompt people, who does not have discernment to make this choice?  What portion of participation in his country** has a political scientist, well-jointed, theorically foundated, that comproves his theses empirically? one vote in 70 million.  What portion of participation in his coutry has a poor, rude, stupid young guy that only thinks about his today´s meal and tomorrow "god knows what"? one vote in 70 million.  To choose an government member, worthy and able to bare this post, it is undoubtelly necesary to acquire an university diploma. This fact excludes a great part of population.  That is absolutelly contraditory, the same government that is nominated year after year restricts a large access to education, keeping it to oligarchy, feeding the demoratic machine because they know that it provides them the election fuel: Ignorance of voters.   It?  So how can we bare it? They are always talking about democracy, inputing good meanins and synonyms to this beautiful word, making you believe that democracy is a sign of freedom when actually lack of democracy does not remit to rights surrounding.   Eat!  That is what they do to you, they intend you to eat and swallow all these information, without any questioning automatous. Try to process these information realizing your coutry is about to bankrupt, thanks to that people that make you stay quiet, watching your country going down the ladder.  The way to bear the weight of this load is sharing with you by writing this... And maybe feeding some healthy unquiet minds.    *the most correct translation from the original in portuguese would be: how? eat!, but this way there wouldnt be any quibble, there´s in portuguese though, the words how and eat are written the same way "como", but are spelled diferently. Honestly my texts are better in portuguese.

      OW! I definetly gotta buy an AK-47. 0.45mm calibre, whatever exists. If there isn´t any of that, I´ll manufacture by myself.  I was walking down near home when I saw one of millions of no-credit "churches" that are large diffused here in brazil. One of that "no pay, no pray" (as a frined of mine uses to say). Then a scene comes up through my mind: a particular school student firearmed trespasses a church door and discharge all munition into minister´s and followers´ heads. No survivors.  Jail would be glory! I thought for a while... But I looked my side and saw my momy´s face. She´d get shocked, soteropolitan´s society idem. Aw! who cares? These folowers of shit would be clear by their lord when they show up at heaven! LOL  We stopped for a second to look at those those people inside that church. There were about a hundred people ( well , no brains, but a hundred human corpses), evryone with hands stood up, saying some things I couldnt hear at all, and a sound of that music they play on airports during the most vacuum hourlys.  Oh misery! Revolt was uprising my backbones... Give me my AK... can be an hand grenade as well... ok at least a lil knife ... dull!  After some minutes I thought: ok Voltaire was right when he said everybody is within its rights having an different oppinion about everything, and expressing themselves. However nobody is withinh its rights stealing away each other freely attitude! No way!  Allright, I forgive these lil church lured humans, but the minister wont be forgiven! this "fellow" must go to grave, as soon as I got the opportunity to externate my hate... while I cannot, I just write it down, unfortunatelly, but someday, who knows? Oh sweet noise of screams, not sweeter than wonderfull noise of my buddy AK-47´s shots.
