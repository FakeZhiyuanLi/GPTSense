      Yep. I'm still here in Texas. Today me and Kelsey and my aunt are gonna go shopping. I haven't been shopping in a LONG time!! My mom still owes me fifty bucks, (cuz I lent her some cash one day) plus twenty for something I did last night. I'm so proud of what I did, I can't tell you! HAHAHA! It's not illegal or anything .. But that would have made it seem ALOT more fun though! lol   We're goin to the BXPX (that's a store you have to be in the military to get into) and Old Navy and the movies. I'm SO freggin excited. I don't really know why I'm even on here posting .. Cuz that's what good friends do .. We are good friends, right? I hope so. I don't know WHAT I would do without you!!! hahaha I probably don't even know you. I'm gonna go guys. And girls. BYEBYE  ~Kirsty

      Welp, I'm just sitting here .. in Texas .. Don't know how I got here, but hey, I'm here. Texas just wouldn't be the same without ya old pal Kirsty, now would it? No, I don't really know. I came with my parents to see a car show, and now I'm all .. bored. I swear, I never wanna go to another freggin car show ever again. They are so freggin boring, I almost died. I swear, I stroked out like, TWICE! GAH! lol   Well, I'm really missin home right now. My friends and Jonathan, mostly. I haven't had the chance to call them. Mom says it's too expensive (which is like, a lie, cuz she gets free long-distance on her phone. Geez, Mom, come on). I'm callin em ALL tomorrow! hahaha Well, if any of them read this, I MISS YOU GUYS! AND I LOVE YOU!!!! I wish you ALL were here with me.   I'm at my aunt's BANGIN house. Oh my gosh, this place is freggin humungerous! She has to be rich. I get my own ROOM for Pete's sake!!! haha Speaking of which, I'm pooped. It's like, 2:15 in the morning, and I have lots to do tomorrow. I'll get on later. BYEBYE GUYS!  ~Kirsty

Who doesn't? XP Yeah...bout that... ANYWHO! Kirsty better not trade in her bass cause then I'M gonna have to learn how to play bass! No, I don't think so. I mean, I wanna learn, but I doubt I'd be able to get one. And please...who do you think would be better at playing guitar? Me or her? TOTALLY me! lol. I just made up a cool little lyric wallago. Wanna hear? Well too bad cause I'm gonna tell ya anyway. Here it is:       &nbsp;   Sittin here/Not knowing what to do/Why do I feel this way/So far from you?       &nbsp;   Like it? Yeah well I do.

       *to self* Lucida Grande! Sounds important. Anyways .. I was reading me and Kassi's old blog, and I had this weird idear that I wanted another one, cuz on the older one, we had all this stuff on it, and it was good. God saw it too, and He said, "BEHOLD! It was good. Dude." Okay, so God didn't really say that .. but He might have.   &nbsp; I miss school, dudes. Summer is so freggin boring. I'm about to go down the street and shoot myself in the face. Not really .. that would get my clothes all bloody and such, and I'm not into the whole "laundry" thing. But seriously, I miss school. I don't ever have anything to do. I mean, whenever I get the chance, I go places with my friends, and then I end up getting grounded. Which is totally bogus, cuz, I'm the best kid ever. Just ask .. me.  &nbsp; Well, besides that .. I'm saving up for a guitar. Yeah buddy. Watch out Ro, I'll be tearin it up. I ain't playin, I'll be bangin, man. Jerry said to get one at some store in Lawton, and I'm not sure if I should trust him or not. You know how Jerry is.&nbsp;He said they were good and cheap, but that phrase keeps gettin in my head. *in grandpa voice*  "Ya git wut ya pays fer."  Old people are weird.&nbsp; I'm thinking about trading in my bass, but it was a gift, and I don't wanna make the gift-givers feel bad .. But it would really help out in my guitar expenses, ya know what I mean? Anyways.  &nbsp; Oh, and I got myself a job .. from hell. I swear, the devil himself cursed these little kids into being .. demons. *shudder* They are so freggin nuts, I mean, all they wanna do is WRESTLE and BITE and LICK (ew, it's gross, trust me) and that's all I DON'T wanna do. I mean, you'd think since I was older and "in charge" they would listen. BUT NO! .. I hate kids. I hate em. And they hate me, so, it's a mutual kind of hate. I guess .. I hate babysitting. At least the pay is good* .. &nbsp; Well, I guess that's all for now. I'm planning on going to the movies tonight with Brittany and Levi. But, I'll probably get grounded as I walk out the door. Trust me, it will happen. I BREATHE and I get grounded. I love it. Sarcasm is just one of the many characteristics I offer freely. ;)  &nbsp; -Jah Bless dudes- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kirsty Q &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Note the sarcasm in this sentance. I work ten hours and get 25 bucks. That half of minimum wage. Oh joy.** &nbsp; ** There's even more sarcasm in THIS sentance.
