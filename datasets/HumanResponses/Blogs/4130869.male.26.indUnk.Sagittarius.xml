      Well Since the last entry me and my girl talked things over and I made a promise that I'd never treat her like shit again. No matter how mad I got for whatever the reason may be. In other news....I've decided to go ahead and make a few websites. My newest idea is to make a BBW site. This site will hopefully generate me some income from affiliate programs and such to cover the hosting for all 3 of the sites I will have when I'm done. I'll keep you posted don't worry. =)  Other then that today was a pretty boring day. I didn't do much I just ended up going out for lunch and cleaning tried cleaning out my car but it started to fucking rain so those plans got scratched real fast. There is one thing that I noticed today about this Blogger shit that I don't like.....There's no way to tell how many hits/people view your Blog. I'm sorry but I find this really gay. So all this time I'm typing I could be completely talking to  myself . Wow that's a scary thought.  So anyhow, Tomorrows Friday. I pick my son up from Daycare and have him the whole weekend. I'm really looking forward into seeing him. He's growing up so damn fast people, It's scary. Starting to make me feel old and shit but oh well I guess that's apart of life eh? It's crazy when I look at him because he looks and acts so much like me it's scary. I also think about when I was his age and what my mom's must have felt like when she was raising me. Makes me wanna call her sometimes and just let her know that I appreciate everything she did to raise me and mold me into a man. Well people I'm almost done smoking this cig so I'm gonna sign off here and get some sleep. G'night and I'll post again soon. Later!  Ps. If you wanna know where I came up with the title for this entry you need to rent or buy this movie:  urlLink http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116778/

      *Sigh* Well tonight me and my girl decided to eat out at this place I love called "Red Robin" great place and great food plus we only ate there once so we wanted to go again.  On the way there I decide to call my buddy Jay to ask him to come along and try it out since I know he has never been there I figured he'd wanna come along. I pick him up and all 3 of us drive up there to chow down on some mean ass grub on the way there everything was fine I played the new Loyd Banks and Jada CD's for my buddy because he still hasn't herd them yet....That is when it started.  Me being the fucking ignorant ass of a boyfriend that I am totally disregarding the fact that my girl asked me twice to turn it down abit cause of a headache that's been bothering her most of the day ignore that and blast the shit the whole way up there not even giving her a chance to talk. Before I finish this story I wanna ask everyone why is it that you  always  hurt the ones you love the most?  Anyhow we arrive at Red Robin's and decide to eat outside because it was a nice day and people like to stare and snicker at me and my girl because we are a interracial couple and I don't wanna have to go to jail for caving someone's skull in. So we are seated outside and the waitress takes our orders we get them 10 mins. Later and we start to eat. Everything was normal till I bought up Weed into the conversation. Let me enlighten you on what my girlfriend thinks about Weed in her eyes all drugs are bad. Always has been always will be. So I ask Jay if he can get any Kind Buds and as soon as I do I felt her staring at me so I turn and look at her and I'm like "What!?"  She says "We don't have much money" Under her breath. Which she says everytime even if we are stacked at the time. So naturally I instantly get pissed and start bashing her ways of thinking in public with about 15 people around loud enough so every can hear it. I was totally brutal.  I ended up doing this the entire time we were there I wonder how she could even finish her food because of my asshole like behavior. So I don't even take 3 bites from my food I get a to go box and pay the lady and leave. Guess what? I felt I didn't get my point across so I then belittled her the entire ride home (About a 30 min drive). At one point of the verbal bashing I looked over at her as she sat in complete silence and I seen tears in her eyes that wanted to pour at that instant.  So I stopped talking and just thought about the whole thing the rest of the 5 min ride we had till I dropped Jay off and headed back to the house. In that time I truly realized that I do not deserve this woman. She has done nothing but try to help and support me and my actions since the first day we've met. Why do I treat her so bad? Why....?  Over and over again I keep asking myself. And I don't really know what to say......I do know if there's a Heaven or Hell I'm sure I won't be going to Heaven. It kills me because this woman has no end to how far she will go to make me happy....No end. And all she ever really asks for is for me to sit with her and watch TV for an hour or two per night and the fucked up part is...I barely  do  that. Let me give you an idea of what hell she has been thru with me so you can have some insight on how much of a heartless bastard I've been towards her.  I met her in a time of my life when shit was upside down for me. I  just  moved back home after a relationship that went sour with a girl that had some insercurity issues. My buddy put me on to this chat line thing where you call up this dating service and talk with other local people and meet. Sorta like AOL but without the fat chicks. Anyhow I said fuck it and gave it a shot because it was totally free and it was a Tuesday night and there wasn't much going on with the club scene during the weekdays. I call it up and I'm browsing thru the voice greetings and I get a private message from her so I listen to it and I forgot what exactly she said but it wasn't important. The important detail was her voice. She sounded like an angel sent from god himself.  Her voice took me right away so I replied right back and we exchanged phone numbers and she gave me a call about 20 mins later. We talked on the phone and instantly clicked it was fucking surprising as hell because I was really concerned about meeting or hanging out with some chick off this line. Ya never know who your really dealing with until you meet up ya know?  So we talk on the phone for about a hour and she ends up asking me if I wanna hang out that night and I agree because she seemed so honest and such a good person that I couldn't go wrong. Turns out I was right but now I feel like if she regrets even meeting me that night to be honest and I can't even blame her I've done nothing but put her thru so much stress and emontional pain since the start that I should be alone for the rest of my life for it. Anyhow we meet up and drive around for about an hour then decide to go to this public park that's really nice at night with the scene setup it has. So we get there and start to go for a walk talking the whole time and really getting to know each other better we ended up staying there for atleast an hour or more just talking and walking around.  So I complained the feet were starting to bother me from walking and we decide to leave and drive around some more and after about another hour of that I suggest that we go to her place and chill. She was not down for it right away but after she realized that there was pretty much nothing else left to do at that time and no where to go she gave in and we ended up back at her Apartment.  Long story short. We end up hanging out every other day after that night and both decided to comment and get a place together. Everything is fine the first 3 months we are both happy and content with life and how it was going and then one day I got a phone call that changed my life. My mother called me to inform me that a Female I was dating a little bit less then a year ago has got in contact with her and said that I should call her because she is the mother of my newborn son. Ok let me pause for a second to try to make you understand how I felt at the exact moment in time.  I felt like god had literally rained on my parade. I felt like I have just been cheated out of my life and future because I was not ready to be a Father to a child and It totally came out of  no where.  I copied down the info to reach this girl and hung up the phone speechless as on what to even say to this girl that I care so much for. She asked me what was wrong and I sat her down and told her about this girl I was with for a short period of time and explained to her it wasn't serious by far and we just stopped talking. Which was the total truth. After telling her the news she had a look on her face like her life was about to change forever in a way that she never thought it would. But to sum it all up she accepted it no questions asked. Infact she was excited to see what my son looked like and you know how women are with Babys so.  After we talked stuff over I called the girl and arranged to have a DNA Test done asap. She agreed it was a smart idea and we setup and time and day and both followed thru with it. Results came back in a little less then a month and the whole time waiting me and my girl just prepared for the results and talked about our future together. She really didn't care that I had a child with another Female that I wasn't even close to. She totally accepted my son and me in every way possible. I'll  never  stop loving her for that. So after the test came back and we went thru the court shit I end up with a Child Support payment every 2 weeks and having this new born child at my Apartment every weekend. And right from the start my girl became instantly attached to my son in every way. She changed, feed, and played with constantly. She was so excited I sometimes felt like she wished it was her son.  Now that is something that you should truly cherish. Any Woman that accepts you after having a child thrown into the picture only after 3 months of knowing this person is a "Great One" . And like the Italian saying goes "Ya only get 3 Great Ones In your life" So I knew I went thru 2 already I couldn't fuck this one up. Now as time passes I end up going thru a really stressful time in my life learning to accept that my "Fun years" are over and I have to grow up and now be a Father to my son. I end up getting really depressed and not being able to hold a job for a long period of time. Meanwhile my girl was there.....Bills paid, Rent paid,  Child Support paid, Any Baby things needed....Paid.  that's right people she paid for everything. Wanna know why? Because she loves me. I wasn't kidding when I said there was no end on how far she would go to make me happy and she did just that.  Ok by now you have a general idea of what hell I've put this girl thru. And yes I'm sure a lot of you think I'm an Asshole and you know what? I agree. I totally don't deserve this girl infact I've laid in bed some nights and thought about just packing my shit and leaving because I was tired of hurting this girl. I feel so fucking bad as I write this because I'm really thinking about how heartless I've truly been to her and she never deserved any of this. She is the type of person that would do anything to help someone in need. Hell! Her job is just that....She helps people get on their feet and straighten their lives out to become something someday. That should just tell you she really means well with everyone she meets. So now you have a little more insight on what type of person she is and now I'm sure you realize why I say I don't deserve her. I do have to say after writing all of this out I now know what I have to do and when she gets home I'm gonna spend the rest of the night with her.  But it still kills me knowing that you always hurt the ones you love the most.  I'm gonna end this half told I'll finish it tomorrow. Stay tuned.

      So, I have my very own personal blog. Amazing. This first entry will be gay as fuck I'm sure most of you will agree after reading it, BUT! They will get better as I post new entry's everyday. So......Where do I start? Ooook well Let me tell you a little bit about myself, I'm from New York, I'm 26 years old (wow I feel like I'm going on 40) I have a son, he's gonna be 2 In September. Not with the mother of my child of course....Long story but I'm sure I'll get to it in one of my entry's. I do currently have a girlfriend....Most likely gonna end up with this chick for the rest of my life, although I don't mind....Been together for 2 years now and she's been thru hell and back with me, stuck it out for real. I respect that 100%.....She loves my son like he's her own child. I wanna have another kid someday, With her of course. But anyhow, enough on that I'm sure you all know where I'm comming from.  I'm gonna carry on about more personal stuff in later entry's but for starters I'm gonna tell you what kind of fucked up day I had today. Ok, So I go to this job interview today for some company that is looking for a "Customer Service Rep" I talked to the lady on the phone yesterday and setup the Interview and she said all I needed to do was come down with my Resume, Take a short Map test along with a Windows 98 test. So I'm thinking, Ok This is a cake walk....Anyone can read a fucking map and Windows 98 sucked ass but anyone thats been on a computer for more then 10 hours a week can ace that fucking test with ease. Well I got there and when I walked in the door, The first thing I noticed was how fucking small this waiting room was....And I'm not a big guy but damn, They were really cheap when it came down to building space. So I walk up to the sliding glass window and this chick asks me who I'm there to see "blah blah blah" So she waddles down the hallway to go get this lady for me. (Note: The Receptionist had to weigh atleast 300lbs) Funny thing was I interupted her cause she was snacking on what once looked like a Twinkie, She did'nt seem too happy about having to acutally  move  but tough shit, I'm sure I helped her burn off some of that shit she was consuming anyhow, In my eyes..I did this bitch a favor. Anyhow As she "waddled" away I turned around to sit down and wait and I looked to my left and saw a older guy filling out a app. He had to been in his early 50's, I though to myself...."I hope I'm not still looking for shit jobs at that age" as I asked him what job he was applying for, He said "Customer Service" ahhhhhhhh we have a challenge. So I start sizing him up, from the feet to the head he was dressed in some 70's looking disco suit, I'll just call it a leisure suit.  So I'm like "eh' thats cool". Then the beached whale ....errr excuse me fat chick came back and said "Anna" will see you now. So I grab my folder with my 5,000 copies of my resume and head on in. Slamming the door behind me with a grin on my face. So I finally come face to face with "Anna", and as I expected...She was your typical flake in her early 30's soccer mom looking chick. She directs me to her "Office" heh. Now I've had  tons  of jobs, I've been working since I was 16 years old. and I've seen  many  offices, And let me tell ya....This was'nt no office. This my friend was a fucking hole in the wall, Chirst i've seen college bars with bathrooms bigger then what this bitch had called her "Office". So I got a kick outta that, and also how fucking cheap the owner of this company must really be. So she explains in detail of what my job dutie's will be, I act like I'm listening she hands me this "Map Test" which was a single sheet of paper with 6 quesitons and then points to the Road Atlas and tells me to "holla" when I'm done. I'm like.....Ooook. So I take the test, finished it in less then 5 mins. Big surprise....And I get her attention to let her know I'm done. She comes back in and goes over the test I ended up getting 1 question wrong. Gay.  Now she tells me its time to take the Windows 98 test....scary.  So as she walks me back out towards the "waiting room"  I'm thinking "Where the fuck is this computer setup?" and I looks to the right and theres a fucking little prop wall with a piece of paper taped to it that reads "Testing in progress please be quiet" and I seen that little old guy all hunched over in this tight ass corner of this "waiting room". She tells me that I'll have to wait till he's done then I can take it, So I'm like no biggie I'm sure this guy will just breeze thur it like any other person with  some computer knowledge . Keep in mind, She asked me over the phone if I knew how to read a map and If I was familiar with Windows, Which I'm sure she asked everyone that called about this job.  So I sit down and wait................  15 mins. passes.....Still waiting...........  25 mins. passes.......Still waiting, And I get curious to know why the fuck its taking this asshat so god damn long so I lean over and ask him "Is the test   that   hard?"    He replied "eh I'm just stuck on this question..ehhrrerr not something I'm use to ya know?" I'm like  wow . This fucker don't know shit about windows or he'd be fucking done by now. I look around some more and then get fed up after waiting another 10 mins and tell the fat bitch I'm goin to have a smoke outside.  So I come back in after my smoke break (also listened to a song on the radio, Cleaned out my center console and wiped down my dash, which took about 5 mins plus 5 more for the smoke so thats 10 mins that I passed outside) and I look to my right and what'da know....Dicknose is  still  taking the fucking test. At this point I'm ready to just go over and tell the jackass the fucking answers because if I was forced to wait any longer I was gonna snap, So I ask "So....How's it comming along?" He replies "errehhh, ok I guess I just got stuck again, But I only have a couple questions left so.." I then ask him " So how many questions exactly are on this test?" He replies "erreghhhh about 30 or so". Fucking amazing. 30 questions and almost an hour passes and this dipshit is  still  not done. The time waiting was bad but what topped it off was him mumbling the questions outloud that he was stuck on, Like thats gonna fucking help. If you don't know windows 98, then you don't know it. At one point he had the nerve to ask me if I was waiting on him to finish, I got a huge laugh out of that. So finally after a hour and 15 mins. This fucking moron has finished the test!! I really felt like grabbing him and throwing him thru the prop wall and just leaving at that point. But I just sucked it down and went over to the "Testing area" and thought to myself that I should have brought in my crowbar so I can fit myself into this area of the "waiting room" I start and finish the test in less then 10 mins, meanwhile......Dicknose was taking his "Map test" which he was still taking when I was telling Anna that I was done with my Windows test.  She said she'd give me a call by Friday to let me know if I got the job or not, I'm sure I did. She knew who the better choice was, But I really felt sorry for the staff at that place...On top of the fact that if you fart in there everyone will smell it instantly due to the 5x5 office space, But it also was gonna be a very fucking long day for them to wait on that old guy to acutally finish a 6 question map test.
