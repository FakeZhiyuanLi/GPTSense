       Irish diplomacy is the ability to tell a man to go to hell, so that he will look forword to making the trip.    That's awesome.  Went to the fair last night with Liddie and Greg.  Was fun.  My sister stopped by today!! I love my sissy.  We watched movies and ate pizza and ice cream.  It's almost 6 and I'm still in my pajamas. I feel like I'm a princess :D  lol.  The only thing I have to do today...(or want to do) is pick up my book at barnes and nobles.  WOOHOO*riverdancing*  But I could have gone camping w/t Lydia today.  :P but my momma didn't want me to because she's crazy. c'est la vie. So now I can't hang out with lydia all weekend.  Which sucks Jopa  because I never get to see liddie anyways.  And if I end up going to minnisota I'm gonna kill someone.  Anyways much love .end. Daniela

         I LOVE BUYING SCHOOL SUPPLIES!!!  It's so fun-diddily-umcious. Amist all of the turmoil of starting school again one thing still makes me smile. Buying my school supplies.  It makes me think things like: "with these new pencils I may pass geometry!" and "with these folders I will be the most organized person in the world!" and "Maybe this year Mr. Holmes will retire..." things of that giddy nature.  I love the smell of a new notebook... and perhaps this is slightly phsyco but...I LOVE SCHOOL SUPPLIES! WOOT WOOT!   Okay now that's done.   Went to the mall today with Mariya--was fun.  Bought school supplies (see above) at walmart beforehand.  Went to claires and sweet lordy there was SO MUCH HAPPY BUNNY STUFF it was insane! I Was in heaven.  Or perhaps hell because had no money.  So I looked for like a half hour on one shelf before Mariya was like 'okay loser lets go' so I was forced to leave.... Now I'm home typing this stupid thing because I'm bored and nothing is on tv.  ooooooooo heeeeeyyy I need to buy a bag for school....that'll be fun.  Kind of. Bags arn't as fun. I want one of those sholder baggy things with all the pockets. Oh yeah that would be the best. makes me feel like dancing. *riverdances* But what color? How about black? YEAH! cool. .end. Daniela

        I love you all very much.  Well okay I love most of you very much.  My name is Danielle. I like my name :D.  In a bronx tale, when the little Italian boy is walking up to the pretty girl he likes and he's thinking 'I bet she has a pretty name like Danielle or...' whatever other names he says.  Bronx tale is such a cute movie......Anywayz.....I have a sister, Courtney, whose 22 and completely awesome :)  and I live with my momma whose pretty cool herself.  My best friends are LYDIA and TRISTA because their the bestest....ummmm.... .end. Daniela
