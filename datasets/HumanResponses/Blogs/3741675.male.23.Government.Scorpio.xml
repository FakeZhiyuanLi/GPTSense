						   Once along time ago there was a kingdom. and the king of this kingdom had a son, he was so happy there was nothing the king would do fo his son. this boy once he was old enough would pick flowers and give them to whoever he saw no matter if they said thank you or not whether or not they kept them. he did this every day it was his favorite thing to do, but he did not know why he did it or where there was a reward in it. so on his fifth birthday when his dad the king asked what he wanted he said "i'd like to know why i pick flowers and then give them to others" so the king consulted his court adviser. and the court adviser said " it helps him to discover what kind of king he will be" with that king sent his son of to play well on his tenth birthday the father said "I am wanting to give you whatever you want" so the boy posed the same question as on his fifth birthday. And this time the king called for his court scribe a man considered very smart. and the scribe said " it teaches him how to be wise" and with that the party for that year began. well, five years went by with the bot still doing his most favorite thing and he discovered girls liked what he did, but even that discovery did not satisfy him. so when his dad the king asked him the same question as five years before he asked the same question as he had on his fifth birthday. this time the king called for his court psychologist. and the psychologist said " it helps him to discover his pontetial. the boy was still not satisfied but accepted the answer to honor his father and when right on doing his most favorite thing. well, his twentieth birth day came on the same thing happend on this birthday as it had five years aog with the father asking the same thing and the son the same. this time the king was desperate so the court jester was called and said " maybe it makes him happy" well the boy that maybe the court jester was making a point, but still was not satisfied. so he began walking through the town and the old wise dude(think non pot smoking surfer hippie) saw him. and the old wise dude said " hey man like why is your face lookin like the face of like a saint bernard, dude?" to which the boy said " like dude i can't figure why i like to pic flowers and then like give em to all the old ladies and the babes and everyone else and where is the reward for me?" and the old wise dude thought for like a couple of minutes and then said " well did you ever think that maybe like the whole reason why you give is because you love to and like the reward is in the giving" "thanks old wise dude said the young man. the moral is this giving is giving when you give you have already recieved a chance to show love never expect anything in return because you may never get anything in return   DaViD l sPRagUE

       You know sometimes as a follower of God and Jesus, i have a very hard time being patient for him to do the things i need or want done. You see i want what i want when i want it. No matter what. Anyway i think it's because i am still learning how to wait on God and the "god on the inside" i mean the God who is the sovereign I am . and lost of people struglle as well because we don't really know him in all of who we are and i think that's because we want a God we can fit to us to our life style. and not to God so much of the time we spend chasing other things in order to advoid him except when we feel like we need him. i find that very interesting. anywho, back to what i was saying i have recently learned it's ok to just wait on God it's ok to do nothing when we're in his presence it's ok to fall as long as we let him pick us up and we can do nothing on our own. and yet we always try. so if you are a brother or sister in the Lord know you are still with him even when you sin and that he never leaves and that he is always there askign you to reach to him. in the name of&nbsp; Jesus Christ.
