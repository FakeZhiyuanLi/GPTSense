      True Story:  I was walking to the train station this morning, when I heard a voice from behind me saying "You smell devine.  Your perfume is just beautiful.", just then a lady appeared next to me, seemingly out of nowhere, she was jogging with one of those athletic baby strollers (god bless those morning joggers, I'm striving to become one myself, but it's SO hard to get out of bed that early in the morning!).  I was so taken back but managed to stutter out an "oh...uh....thanks?!?", & as she gained more ground before me she shouted back: "WHAT IS IT?", "OH....IT'S MICHAEL KORS" I shouted back feeling a little self conscious that I was screaming out the name of designers so early in the morning (usually I reserve that to the late afternoon as I'm walking home, somebody's gotta stir up my quaint little neighborhood!). "IT'S BEAUTIFUL!" she shouted back before she disappeared into the morning mist as if she had never existed (Okay, dramatic overkill, but roll with me here - voile, cinematic magic with the fog machine....and scene!)  That made my day.  It was kinda awkward that she was jogging past & away from me as we had this little exchange of words, but I was happy that somebody noticed my lovely aroma - I aim to please!  Then I came to work & haven't had a moment's rest since!  Needless to say, I'm a little overwhelmed!    Just wanted to blog my very fragrant story because I always find irrelevant little things like that amusing!  Herherher - did you notice I'm a big cheesehead!?!  A divine diva & big cheesehead all in one - who knew it was possible!  Peaaaaace!

      That is where I was last night - my very FIRST concert ever (I s**t you not)!  And it was good-everlasting-gobstopping-fun.    Okay, so I did get sudden heart palpatations when I slowly realized there were hordes of adolescents (7+ years my junior)walking in the same direction as me towards the Beacon on 74th a hour before showtime...in the back of my mind, I knew Jason was Top 40 - his songs frequented the fm waves of Z100 (the teeny-bopper station of choice here in the tri-state area) & he had made several TRL appearances so there was absolute potential for the teen invasion.  But I figured - it's a school night, it's May - aren't these kids busy with finals, SATs, mallratting, & shopping for prom dresses at Pzaz or something around this time??? They're not gonna take the LIRR into the city to catch a concert, right?!...I was sadly mistaken.  But despite all of that - I was happy.  Jason was a little little dot of a man on stage (we were pretty far back) but his voice can be heard all around which is what counted since it wasn't so much the image as it was his effortless clear-as-day voice & carefree style that first captured my attention & made me an insta-fan. Okay...the image sealed the deal for me - he's just so darn cute!   I must say...there's a lesson to be learned from Orville Redenbaucher's new Cinnabon Popcorn, something I tried for the very 1st time this weekend.  When I saw it in the store, I thought to myself "Self - this has the potential to be REALLY nasty or REALLY scrumptulescently magically delicous", so I took the plunge & bought it.  It was strange but GOOOOOD!  I do have a point here - & the point is, my good best friend accompanied me to the concert last night despite her phobia of teeny-boppers & her lack of knowledge about the Mraz-man himself.  And she actually enjoyed his music - she liked it, she really liked it!  So henceforth: Orville's Cinnabon Popcorn = Jason Mraz Concert-going experience = Delightfully refreshing good times!  Thank you my friend of friends - y'know who you are!  So with that - I hope you all enjoy the upcoming summer touring season!  Get out there, support your favorite artists & remind them why they do what they do by your appause, lingerie flinging (for the girls only!), & constant hooting & hollering!  PS -don't Boo their opening act...that's just disrespectful!

      When I first found out about "blogging" - I have to admit, I thought those who created their own blog must be semi-narcissistic - the type of people who think they're SO clever & SO original.  Now before anyone gets annoyed or defensive & writes something nasty to me on my very first entry, consider this - I am here writing, aren't I?  That could be because I too am semi-narcissistic & think really highly of my intelligence & creativity (my head is kinda big, whether that's ego or genetic is your call)OR it could be that I've come to the revelation that people seek ways to express themselves & here is the perfect forum, you can be anonymous (the path I'm choosing) & share whatever thoughts cross your mind to whomever might be tuning in.  And if people like what you have to say & keep coming back for more, instant ego-boosting goodness - & if not, well, as long as you think you're "the s**t", than go on with your bad self!  So with that, hello - I'm Diva.  I'm a 25 year old female from New York.  If you ask me my friends, they'd probably have a good laugh at the notion of me being going under the alias of "diva".  I'm not high maintenance & demanding, I don't walk around with an entourage (well...except for an umbrella toting Farnsworth Bentley, oh wait, PDiddy's not a diva is he?), & I've never thrown my diamond encrusted stilettos at anyone (nor would I, even if I did have a pair).  But I've always liked the word "diva" & don't see it in the negative light that some others do.  There is such a thing as a nice diva, I'm not necessarily that yet, but I can aspire to be fabulous, no?  So with that, I'll end this very first entry.  And if anyone's seen Farnsworth around town, tell him I love his cameos in all those Outkast videos, but PDiddy's been very ill-prepared on both rainy & overly sunny days, & well, I just don't want to see another celebrity falling out.  Thanks.

      Okay, we're half way through the week!  Hang in there folks, 2 more days till a long weekend, keep pushing along!  Hmmm...I have nothing specific to address today (no smelly men, no perfect jeans, no movie review, no bitching about work - not because there's nothing to bitch about but b/c I'm sick of writing about the drama at Dinky Co.), but I do want tell you all to start watching "Joe Schmo 2" if you're currently not - whether you love or hate reality television, this is one clever & funny show.  Spike TV (the Men's network) Tuesday nights @ 10pm, I know it competes with Queer Eye (which I also love), but both shows rerun several times during the weekend so you can definitely do your part to support both.  There's also a Joe Schmo blog...I s**t you not!  And if you come to love the show, you will certainly love the episode summaries which are written by Brian Keith Etheridge (no relation to Melissa) who was part of the 1st Season cast as "The Buddy".  Both are accessible through the official website.  As long as we're talking about television, I'm also REALLY excited about VH1's I Love the 90s which starts July 12th (those of you who watched I Love the 80s, 80s Strike Back, or I Love the 70s will understand my enthusiasm!)...maybe this indicates that I'm getting old but I definitely prefer VH1 over MTV now!  I also love Best Week Ever...it always makes me piss my pants laughing (okay, not literally, but...well, maybe just a smidge!).  Yes, VH1's recently transitioned into one live version of US Weekly magazine highlighted by the appropriate music, but it's aiiiiiigh wit me!  I love VH1, yea...I'd marry it!  Well heck, as long as I'm plugging things - Jason Mraz's LIVE CD/DVD set comes out August 24th!  He's amazing live performer, I highly recommend it!  I LOVE Jason Mraz, luv luv luv, yea...I'd marry him over VH1!  So today's the last day of June & I'm happy to announce that I'm under my monthly budget despite a couple of shopping sprees (my Lucky jeans, BBW Honeysuckle lotion, VS Angels bras, & some other new additions to my summer wardrobe).  Whoo-hooo!    Clearly my head's a little foggy today (again - high on life, not on drugs) but I've plugged everything I need to plug for now!  Peaaaaace!

      I have a bone to pick with the fellas out there...it's an issue I take very seriously & feel like I've been recently negatively effected by...it's about the way you smell. This is an issue of common courtesy & respect to the noses around you.  This morning, a guy stood next to me in the elevator at work, I got one whiff of his cologne & I almost choked on the potency that was his odeur!  Then I held my breath...& as I began to suffocate, I contemplated my options - this dude's cologne odeur  or  passing out from the lack of oxygen to my lungs...it was truly a toss up.  Thankfully that's when the elevator doors opened & I stumbled out onto my floor.  I don't want to point fingers or kick groins...you won't learn that way, well...maybe, but I'm feeling peacefully zen today so I would like to give y'all some pointers instead:  As a start, it's good to shower everyday (especially during the summer) & use deodorant regularly.  It's also good to wash your clothes regularly so they don't collect odors of the past.  An odorless, clean body is a good start before you start adding any additional fragrances.  In my book, you don't even had to add fragrances - I am a big fan of the fresh-out-of-the-shower smell - Poland Springs is my favorite soap smell for a man.  I am also a big fan of the freshly-laundered smell (think dryer sheets), especially in the winter time (it leaves me feeling warm & fuzzy).    In terms of cologne & other fragrances, there's 2 things that come into play - 1. Technique 2. The actual fragrance.     Technique : I quote the words of my good friend Kyan of Queer Eye fame (I don't know him personally, but the Fab 5's quest to help the straight fellas out there is much appreciated, plus it makes for excellent television): "Spray...Delay...& walk away" (note that when you spray, it's into the air before you, not directly onto your body.  Wait a beat & walk through the mist to pick up the scent), it's not "Spray, Spray, Spray...Delay...well heck I might as well bathe in it".  This is especially true in the summer since body heat opens up the pores which intensifies one's scent (whether it be natural or bottled).   Fragrance Selection : In terms of selecting a scent, I'm sorry to say that most men don't know what they're doing & perhaps your options are to blame because 98% of them are absolutely terrible!  Most are too strong, too musky, & they lack subtlety &/or the hint of anything natural...they bad fellas, they REAL bad!  But I know there are good ones out there, somewhere beyond the horizon - I once worked in retail with a gay man who I considered proposing marriage to, despite the sexual preference barrier, because he smelled so damn good...I don't know what scent he was wearing back in the day, but it was masculine, clean, fresh, & subtle.  Unfortunately, I have not done enough extensive research to give you any recommendations, but SUBTLETY is the key!  Here's what I suggest - ask for the assistance of the women in your life (be it girlfriends or wives, moms, sisters, friends...any woman with a good nose & good taste), go to Sephora (no department stores, there's too much pressure & obligation to buy from commission-driven employees) & spend some time researching & getting the feedback from the ladies.  Take your time with it, get recommendations from the female sales people if need be (emphasize that you want something subtle!)...do it right or don't do it at all!  So with that, I'll leave you all to ponder the effects of your own smell.   I just want to contribute to making this world a better smelling place!  Thank you & good night!

      Movie Review Time is upon us once again...  No, I didn't opt to see "Fahrenheit 9/11" for some political controversy, I didn't see "White Chicks" or "Dodgeball" for giggles & s**ts, nor did I choose "Two Brothers" so I can hang out with the 12 & under crowd.  This week, I chose  "The Notebook" , which was based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks.  The first time I saw a commercial for it, I was captivated, I guess it appealed to the romantic in me, plus I read "A Walk to Remember" last year & as simple as the story was, it made me cry (I've yet to see the movie starring Mandy Moore, though I do hear it was surprisingly good).  I caught the 1:30 matinee show, so the audience consisted of mostly teenage girls & lots of grandmas (note to the fellas, yes this is a chick flick...whoa is it a chick flick!).  The movie was breathtakingly beautiful visually, the settings were so picturesque, I had a hard time believing it was all real.  It is because of the visuals that I would recommend seeing this on the big screen.  The acting was good.  I didn't like Rachel McAdams character Allie (the female lead) at times because she was just kind of bratty, but I think that was part of the role so McAdams portrayed her well.  Ryan Gosling - sigh, how do I put this in the most subtle way...DAMN, that boy is foine!  Okay, it's not so much the look (though that boy has a way of making a beard look sexy) but the way he carries himself, the ease & charisma just comes through on screen & that makes him incredibly appealing to me! I also really loved Gosling's character, Noel...sad to say, men like that are few & far between.      The story itself, hmmm...there was some aspects that were really cliche (the whole social class thing between the two star-crossed lovers felt very Rose & Jack from "Titanic" to me, but there was no iceberg in sight), but there's a revelation that reveals itself throughout the movie that was really touching & left the whole audience crying at the end of the movie (myself included, the lights went on before anyone had a chance to compose themselves so we all tried to stifle our sniffles & dry off our tears before making a mad dash for the ladies room).     Of course there are always some mood spoilers in the audience, this time, it was the teenage girls who gasped loudly when Noel gropes Allie's breasts & giggled uncomfortably during every love scene....I mean, come on girls, let's be adult about this (heheheheh, but you guys, ohmigod he totally grabbed her boobies & they totally did "it", y'know....sex, shhhhh!  I just wrote s-e-x on my blog, holy cow, I'm so scandalous!).  So in the end, I can't dislike a movie that moved me to tears.  But I wish I had read the book beforehand because I think that would have made it more profound.  So I will add "The Notebook" to my summer reading list just to have a good cry & ponder if I'll ever find such a passionate love in my own life one day.   Anhhhhh, a girl can dream.

      Yea it's Friday!  Whoopeeee!    It's been a long week, full of ups & downs.  I was pretty distraught over the South Korean man who was beheaded by Iraqi terrorists earlier this week, just reading about it put me in quite a depressed funk. I'm glad I didn't see any of the video footage, the tiny pictures that yahoo news provided was enough to make my eyes well up & my heart sink.  Then that same night I found out that Mattie Spepanek, the young poet of "heartsongs", lost his battle with muscular dystrophy at age 13.  I had seen him on Oprah a while back, his attitude towards life astounded me & he made me cry cry cry (but it's ok, Oprah was bawling too!), he was an amazing person & his death broke my heart!  Ooooh, I'm all vaclempt!  Well, I'll lead you all into the weekend with something my mom forwarded me, it's  "Instructions for Life or Good Karma"  according to the Dalai Lama.  Well, I don't know how much the Dalai Lama had to do with the actual email itself because it was a chain letter (y'know, forward this to 10 people & you will receive a happy surprise), but I found it pretty insightful so I'd like to share it with you:  1. Take into account that great love & great achievements involve great risk.  2. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.  3. Follow the three "R"s: Respect for self, Respect for others, Responsibility for all your actions  4. Remember that getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.  5. Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly.  6. Don't let a little dispute injure a great relationship.  7. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.  8. Spend some time alone everyday.  9. Open arms to change, but don't let go of your values.  10. Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer.  11. Live a good, honorable life.  Then when you get older & think back, you'll be able to enjoy it for the second time.  12. A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for your life.  13. In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the current situation.  Don't bring up the past.  14. Share your knowledge.  It's a way to achieve immortality.  15. Be gentle with the earth.  16. Once a year, go someplace you've never been before.  17. Remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other.  18. Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it.  19. Approach love & cooking with reckless abandon.  I'm with you there Mr. Dalai Lama, but me cooking with reckless abandon would probably be messy & the food would probably taste a little funkified...but hey, if I'm gonna have good karma then bring on the pots & pans!  Have a lovely weekend folks!

      Okay, why am I always the last one at work???  Actually, I like the silence that is an empty office, I get so much more done this way - plus I can take a rest & post a new entry here without feeling self conscious about the loud clicking that is my typing!    I talked to a good friend of mine from Parsons (college) last night, she is one of the few people I've known that is really great about keeping in touch & I appreciate that SO much!  When I first graduated out of high school, I was determined to keep in touch with all my friends.  Well, I think I had dinner with the handful that went to NYU 1st semester, caught up with another handful at the alumni breakfast a few months later, & after that, I never saw most of my high school friends again (with the exception of a small circle which I had mentioned several entries ago, the Chillaxation crowd!).    When I graduated from college, I knew I would inevitable lose touch with most of my friends, but I tried the email thing & it worked out great for the summer.  My full inbox made me feel like social butterfly that I was my last year at Parsons, but eventually the emails became less frequent to the point that I can now I can count the people I'm still in touch with on one hand.  But I LOVE LOVE LOVE that handful of friends, talking with them always makes me laugh, refreshes my senses & makes me so incredibly grateful that I went to Parsons & I had the opportunity to meet & be inspired by them.    See how I'm babbling, that's what one long phone conversation with my buddies can do!  But I miss all my fellow alumni who seemed to have dropped off the face of the earth, they were a great group of incredibly talented & good-hearted people (IN FASHION?!, surely you jest - but alas, I am being honest, we had an amazing class - 2001)!  I am a sucker for reminiscing...& a big sap as well!

      Oh what a lovely & fast weekend that was...& now it's Monday, AGAIN?!?  Fudgies!  I went shopping yesterday (uh...yes, in honor of Father's Day!) & was delighted to see so many sale signs all about! I am happy to announce that I finally bought a pair of Lucky Brand jeans, & on sale nonetheless!  I've been contemplating splurging on jeans recently, but $100-$200 is a bit steep for blue jeans in my book, so I was overjoyed when I found these babies for 50% off!  I must say, they are the best jeans I've ever owned.  They're low but not Butts McCracken low, they're a dark wash but perfectly faded in all the right places for that distressed worn-in look (which always confuses my mother, because she keeps asking me "Why are you buying used pants?"), they're the perfect length with just the right amount of flare at the bottom (not too much so I trip over them when I walk too fast), the back pockets are perfectly placed for the most flattering butt-enhancing effects, & best of all, when you unzip it, there's a little label that reads "Lucky You" on the inside!  I love that - it's so Britishly tongue & cheekay, HELLS YEAH Lucky You if you ever get to go there, is what I say!  Also - for all you ladies out there (& perhaps some of the fellas too - whatever tickles your fancy my friends!) - Bath & Body Works & Victoria's Secret are also having their semi-annual sales right now, so this is an excellent time to stock up.  I highly recommend the Angels bras (very comfortable & sleek fit, just enough padding to avoid a case of nipplitis - unless you're into the full-salute look) & I LOVE BBW's body lotion (Honeysuckle was my signature scent all throughout high school & college).  I know it's kind of girlish & silly & sounds superficial, but shopping can be so uplifting, it was a nice way to start my week!  Well...this is what you get when I feel obligated to blog but don't have that much to share, hopefully someone out there can identify with my elation over finding the perfect jeans (on sale), good lingerie & moisturizers (also on sale), & the euphoric effects of shopping (during sale time).  Yes, I am rather easily amused by simple little joys in life, & yes, I am a big cheesehead once again, thanks for noticing!  High on life, not on drugs folks!  Good week to you all!

      Tomorrow's Father's Day, but unfortunately, my daddy & grandpa are in Taiwan right now so I won't be able to celebrate with them.    I recently mentioned to my dad that I had started a blog (of course, I had to explain what a blog was) & he has asked if he could be one of my "readers".  I'd actually rather keep Divawho under wraps from my parents, not that they think I'm a little angel but I'm actually a wild child, but rather...they, as my parents, don't  need  to know everything that I choose share on here (with a couple of my friends & perhaps some anonymous strangers who don't know my true identity).  I can't quite articulate it, but I'm sure you guys know where I'm coming from.    So even though I won't be giving my blog address to my dad, I will forward him this entry in honor of him on Father's Day:  My dad, I call him many names - Mr. Scooby (not my last name), Mr. Dad, Daddy Warbucks (also not my last name), Baba (the Chinese version of "Papa"), & also the standard Dad.  My father is a lover of many things - aquaculture (frogs, fish, crustaceans, turtles - if it lives in water, he's interested), photography (we like to call him our very own paparazzi because he LOVES taking candid pictures wherever we go), science (he is the reason why I did so well in science classes throughout high school), art (especially collecting art & antiques from Asia), Taiwan (his motherland), & first & foremost, his family (that's where I come in!).    My father is one of the most supportive people in mine life.  He always wanted me to be a scientist (like him), but when I chose an artistic path for college (Parsons School of Design) & my career (fashion design), he embraced my choice with such enthusiasm that it surprised me to realize that what made him happy was my happiness.  I feel extremely loved & fortunate that my dad supports what I do 100%, rather than get caught up in his own dreams for me to be in a more "noble & prestigious" profession such as a doctor or a lawyer (the way many parents do).    My dad is always enthusiastic about my art - sometimes the way he genuinely "oohs & ahhhs" over some of my artistic creations (I will be the first to admit a lot of them were pretty unimpressive &/or flat out fugly), reminds me of the way that parents of 3 year olds would react to a smudged messy fingerpainting (which resembles...um...an amoeba?!) that their paint-covered child brings them with such pride.  But my dad is truly truly impressed by what I've come up with & insists on framing everything & taking pictures of them to show his friends & my extended family in Taiwan!    For as long as I've been alive, my dad has been his morning exercises (which includes a lot of bouncing around & shaking his limbs all about, then it transitions into stretches, then comes the push-up which are fast-paced & all the while his head is bopping all around...it is a fascinating sight to behold.).  My dad is also the most studious person I've ever seen, he will sit in the library for hours doing research & hand-writing notes with such focus & concentration, it's almost in-human (I, on the other hand, get easily distracted by shiny objects).      My dad is honest, a good listener, articulate, devoted & loving, focused, stubborn, supportive, studious, a little silly, dignified, & makes the best french toast & instant noodles in the world (as far as I'm concerned).  That's who my dad is in a nutshell.    I love you, Dad!  Happy Father's Day to you all!

      This was my weekend: woke up, put on my Juicy Couture Terry Smocked Tube Babydoll, Seven jeans, Uggs, & Birkin bag.  Had a little shopping spree at the new Bloomingdales in Soho, went to Spice Market to meet up with my 3 best friends (the slutty blonde, the naive brunette, & the cynical red head), & bought the most recent issue of "Hamptons" magazine, since we're heading down there for some Tommy Hilfiger party next weekend to brush shoulders with the likes of PDiddy & Tara Reid.    Ummm...NO!  Despite my blog name & the fact that I work in fashion - I am not a ritzy, fancy-pants kinda gal, nor do I really have the desire to be a ritzy, fancy-pants kinda gal.  The only truth to that whole story is that I actually did acquire 2 recent issues of "Hamptons" magazine - it was free at Chat & Chew, & you know I love my freebies!  Here is some insightful stuff from  Hamtons Magazine :  * On the cover are these Headlines:  "Names Names Names - Everyone who's anyone is in our pages.  Are you?"  "Did you make The List?  We doubt it.  But you Never Know." "Beauty, Power, Food, Wayward Socialites, Moguls-on-the-make, Entertaining, & Sexual Escapades.  Who can ask for anything more?"  * Some examples of what is featured on their In/Out lists: In: Tara Reid's boobs / Out: Courtney Love's boobs Hand dogs (tiny pets carried at parties) / Smelly dogs in bags (on Jitney) Ice Princesses / Freezing to look good at clubs Hogan plastic totes / Plastic furniture Moschino / Mosquitos Lush Gardens / Lushes High IQ / Low Pants Fighting over carats / Fighting over carrots Ballet / Valet Rock collecting / Aging rockers Strong drinks / Colorful drinks Puffy's White Party / Wearing cream to Diddy's Mischa Barton / Lindsay Lohan Estates / Cheap dates  I never really had the desire to go to the Hamtons & after flipping through the magazine, I have to say - if this a fair representation of the mentality of E. Hampton...then I will NEVER set foot there - EVER!  I'd rather camp out in Bumblef**k, USA than hang out with Hamtons social climbers if this is what they're all about.    Hey - what time is it?  Well, it's funny that you ask because it's actually MOVIE REVIEW time!  Yea!  Up this week is  Stepford Wives !  I know critics tore this movie apart, but I actually liked it!  I loved the acting, ESPECIALLY Glen Close (but not Matthew Broderick), the costumes & set, & all the funny eccentric moments so much that it clouded over much of the faulty, unexplained areas in the plotline.  I do have to note that I never saw the original which I'm told was COMPLETELY different (not a comedy), so I didn't have a comparison point going in.  Also, I went in with VERY low expectations & watched it with an enthusiastic crowd at the Loews on 19th & y'know that kind of energy is contagious, so perhaps that's why I thought it was such a hoot!    With that, I wish you all yet another speedy week!

      It's Friday!  It's Finally FRIDAYYYY!  You can't see me right now but I'm dancing around like that old guy from from the Great Adventure Six Flags commercials!  Um...okay, not really, I'm just sitting at my computer at work taking a break from organizing all my paperwork so I can start fresh next week!  By the way, I'm kind of scared of the old guy from the aforementioned commercial - & why's he dancing to the Venga Boys...couldn't the folks at Great Adventure use a newer song, something a little less Macarena-esque? I would have chosen "Yeah" by Usher - it's overplayed, I know, but I still think it's one of the fattest songs I've ever heard.  Did you catch that..."fattest", did you really think that I was that much of a tool?  FYI to all you player-haters: I'm down wit it, some may even say I'm jiggy wit it, I can pull off saying "You Go Girl" & "Um-hmm That's Right!" like no one's business, & I'm VERY much aware of the proper PH spelling of PHat!   Okay, is it blatantly obvious that I have completely lost it at this week's end?!?  Yeahhh.  I did want to share a funny little story with you - I frequently get my Friday lunches at Le Crossaint Shop, so the 2 Hispanic sandwich chefs there know me pretty well by now.  One of them said "Ni hao ma?" to me today, which is Chinese for "How are you?" (FYI - I'm 1/2 Chinese, 1/2 Taiwanese).  Normally I HATE when non-Chinese people I don't know well try to speak the little Chinese they know to me - especially when they use it as a pick-up line (I also can't stand it when guys try to guess my ethnicity...is that considered a super power in some countries, should I be impressed?  Well, I'm not & you will most likely receive the "Stare of Death" from me.)  But the sandwich chef guy was SO proud with himself, I just laughed it off.  Then he said he was Chinese too, to which I responded by looking at him like he was crazy, "Okay I'm not, but I want to be - can I (be Chinese)?" he asked enthusiastically.  I told him I'd discuss it with "mine people" & let him know next time.    Well, I've since called my Chinese peeps & we've decided to let BOTH the Le Crossaint sandwich chefs into the Honorary Chinese Club.  Let's give a big friendly welcome & round of applause for Javier & Carlos!  Yea!  Oh my goodness - I s**t you not but "Yeah" by Usher just came on the radio, step back folks, I'm gonna bust a move now - I hope you all will do the same this weekend!  Have a good one!

      Jay-Z had a baby this morning!!!  Oh, wait a minute - before you start blaming me for some crazy tabloid rumor, I'm not talking about "Big Pimpin'"/Beyonce's Man/Black Album rapper Jay-Z - I'm talking about my wonderful supervisor sweater designer who's initials are J.Z.!  Ah ha ha...tricky tricky!  Jay-Z, that's the nickname we've given her here at Dinky Co., we are clever folks doncha think?!  No...oh, ANYHOW, as happy as we all are for her & her new baby boy (weighing in at 7lbs & measuring 21" inches long - a little nugget of a man!), my fellow designers & I are also freaking out because we are now responsible for her spring 2005 collection on top of everything else.   As if I wasn't having massive anxiety about work already, to the point that it's infiltrated what I had initially intended to be a simple blog about whatever tickles my fancy - now I have a whole lot more on my plate here...WHOA!  Panic ensues!  Deep breaths...Calm...Relax...think tranquil thoughts...Serenity now, Serenity now, Serenity NOW motherf**ker!      Ahhhh...I'm okay now, sorry for that moment of crageyness.  But yea, the miracle of life - amazing huh?!  Since I've started working at Dinky Co. nearly 2 1/2 years ago, EVERY married woman here has been pregnant at least once - that's 6 new bouncing babies (& counting) - we consider our office on 7th Avenue the "Fertile Crescent" of the garment district!  Needless to say, there is no escaping the baby stories of all the new mommies - but I usually get a kick out from hearing how these munchkins develop into little characters!    Well, I'm pooped out & yet I still have a couple more things to take care of before I can leave the office - so with that, I bid you adieu!

      I hope everyone had a lovely weekend - despite the terribly dreary weather!  What did I do all weekend...so nice for you to ask my devoted pretend readers!  Well, I'll tell ya then:  I ran my butt off on the treadmill which lifted my spirits & gave me the feeling of...well,  GIRL POWAH  (That's British pronunciation via the Spice Girls - I miss them so...sigh)!  Along with the fire under my butt for a career transition, is the fire for keeping a strict work out regimen for pure empowerment & physical/mental/emotional well-being - it's quite miraculous what a little sweat can do for a girl!  I also got an unexpected call from some high school friends beckoning for a get together!  They were having a reunion dinner at 9:30pm - Oh, my hs buddies, they're still on this cragey night-owl schedule (I feel like an old lady going to sleep at midnight-1am everyday), but I don't get to see them often so I refreshed myself, got all perrty & joined in the festivities. We had dinner at the Macaroni Grill, I highly recommend the "Ultimate Leaning Bellini" (it tastes like a potent peach/raspberry daquiri & is served in a tall frosted glass, which I swiped as a souvenir...for shame, I know but I assure you this is not a common practice of mine!).  At the restaurant, we caught up on what everyone's been up to recently, made fun of each other, reminisced about the good ol' days, & ordered what seemed like the entire dessert menu to share (girls - you gotta learn to eat fast when you've got 3 guys at the table!).  We wound up hanging out at a friend's house just chillaxing (a new word for you all, courtesy of my very good but very gassy friend Mike) & talking about random things (such as bagels, knives, work/grad school woes, the club/bar scene from a girl's perspective, our personal OCDs, etc.) till 6 in the morning!    I don't know what it is, but no matter how long it's been since we've all been together, or how much we may have all changed & grown since high school, whenever we do reunite - everything seems to click as if no time has passed.  I guess that's a sign of a true & genuine friendship or bond!  Whoa - that was so WB-teen-drama of me!!!  The cheese factor is in effect here at Divawho!  I did a little window shopping this weekend too...did I ever tell you of my love for Crate & Barrel?  They have so much overpriced unnecessary fancy pants objects, but everything is so beautifully designed & colorful - it warms my heart with it's prettiness!  I didn't buy anything there though (how's that for self control), but I'm stocking up on vases when they have a sale!  I wish you all a quick fly-by work week!  Laters!

      Okay, I hate to bore people with the drama that is my workplace (alias "Dinky Co.") - but I just wanted to tell my pretend loyal readers some fascinating development at work at this week's end:    The evil bitch who brought me to my shameful shameful tears yesterday...she apologized to me this morning (to which I responded with a half-hearted garbled "It's okay.") & she tried to buddy up to me with a B&W cookie!  AND, get this - the big boss announced today that we can hire a new assistant designer (something so incredibly long-overdue, I nearly fell over in my chair when he announced it)!  Isn't it amazing what can happen in the course of 24 hours.....um, so this is my thinking yesterday vs. today (ding ding):  Yesterday: I don't trust the evil bitch for s**t. I've been at this company for way too long & I'm lighting a fire on my own ass to start preparing to make a transition - out of here!    Today:  I STILL don't trust the evil bitch for s**t. I've been at this company for wayyy too long & I'm SERIOUSLY lighting a fire on my own ass to start preparing to make a transition - out of here! Sorry, the prospect of some additional help & a B&W cookie (though delicious & so ying-yang like), hasn't changed a thing.   I'm over it - Moving on...to something completely irrelevant - A diva's  MOVIE REVIEWS!     13 Going on 30  - I LOVE Jennifer Garner & she's as good playing a teeny-bopper as she is playing super spy on Alias.  There's a lot of interesting aspects to the plot, however due to either bad writing or too much editing, nothing comes into full fruition & it all seems a little scattered.  It felt a lot like a ABC Family Channel movie at times with higher profile actors.  A couple of cute scenes, but not worth $10 - VIDEO RENTAL!   Troy  - Everyone keeps talking about Brad Pitt & Orlando Bloom, but the real star of this movie is CLEARLY Eric Bana (aka "The Incredible Hulk" that has anger-management issues & jumps REALLY high & stuff), I loved his role as Hector & he had the most emotional depth & integrity out of all the actors.  This movie is meant to be seen on the big screen, it's visually stunning, & it's long & epic enough that you feel like you get your money's worth.  Guys...I'm sure you'll love the fight scenes (& there are MANY), despite your jealousy for these fOine actors, you have to give them props for all their hard work & effort in this movie!  I'm hoping that this movie leads to some coach of pee-wee sports league shouting "Immortality - take it, it's YOURS", only to be followed by the high pitched cheers & growls of 4-7 year old boys - "GRRRRRRRR!"  Girls (& some of you fellas out there too) - Brad, Orlando, Eric...three beautiful men who you get to see A LOT of in this movie!  Wolfgang Petersen admitted to deliberately turning the tables & objectifying the men in this movie - & God Bless him for it, WE LOVE the Wolfman!  So there's something for everybody - ahhhh, it DID live up to the hype!  I just hope you don't have the Sherlock Holmes sisters sitting behind you in the theatre (like I did), saying such wonderfully insightful things like "Ahhhh, that's the Trojan Horse!"     Raising Helen  - Kate Hudson, she's so free-spirited, cute & likeable, isn't she?!  Joan Cusack, she always plays these quirky dorky characters & she's SO funny & so good at it.  This movie falls short though.  Same exact problem as 13-30 - ABC family on the big screen, underdeveloped plot, cute moments but also not worth $10 - ANOTHER VIDEO RENTAL!  On Video  Big Fish  - The newest addition to my favorite movies.  I cried, I laughed, I said "HUH???" & "What the...?" a coupla times - but beautiful story, wonderful cast (especially Ewan McGregor), amazing visuals...refreshing & delightful!  I saw it twice in the theatres...rent it & get inspired!  Good times with popcorn & darkness!

      I'm the last one at work again!  Today was a toughie - I cried at work (gasp - how undiva-like)!  I bow my head in shame because of all places to cry, the office is the last place that I want to be that vulnerable.  This marks my 3rd time to shed tears here, 1st time my coworker was telling me about her mom who she lost on 9/11, 2nd time that same coworker resigned & left this company (she's since opened her own boutique called Lyd on 405 W 44th Street & 9th Ave, it has been featured in several issues of Lucky & WWD - she's got fantastic stuff & she's such a sweetheart - pay her a visit if you're ever in the area! - that's my plug for the day), & this 3rd time....not the charm!    Before I go on - let me remind you, still surfing the crimson wave here!  So, as I was saying:   I don't mind crying when I'm sad or REALLY happy, but when anger brings me to tears, especially when the anger is brought on by somebody I have absolutely NO respect for & consider to be the stupidest person ALIVE - Aaarrrgghhhhhh - I HATE WHEN STUPID PEOPLE MAKE ME CRY!  Luckily she did not witness my breakdown, she's evil, she would have gotten such a power trip from it - but my fellow designers witnessed the tears in all their glory (hallelujah waterproof mascara for staying put continuing in their mission of thickening & elongating!), they were quick to offer me "water? tissue? cigarette? a shot of vodka? a dart board w/ the bitch's face on it?", to which I responded - "yes - dart board & a potent cosmo!"  I recovered, moved on with my day & got my work done, & am now plotting my revenge on the bitch (I know - revenge is not the way to solve your problems, you are just stooping yourself to her level, communication is the key - ahhh, f**k it - revenge is SWEEEEET!).  Mwahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!  I'm gonna finish up here, go home & run my ass off on the treadmill - did you ever notice how anger just fuels one's workouts...& plotting revenge while running makes the time go so much faster - ahhh, there IS a bright light at the end of the tunnel!  TGIF (tomorrow)!

      I'm alone in the office again!  Last one...well, with the exception of our cleaning lady who just arrived.    This leads me to believe one of two things - either I'm the hardest worker in this company OR I'm the slowest worker in this company...I know I'm not slow, I know I work my little ass off here & I have to hold back angry flailing arms when I'm up to my chin in work & my I spot coworkers surfing the web!  Ooooh boy, there's a little thing that I call the "bitter monster" - it comes out when I'm overwhelmed, underappreciated, & most often when I'm surfing the crimson wave (that's the menstrual cycle for those of you scratching your head) which is the current situation (pronounced sit-chee-ay-shiong).  But on the brighter side - it IS a new month!  You know what that means -  NEW BUDGET !!!  For those more free-spirited spenders, let me explain - I'm an easy-going, laid-back girl in many ways, however EVERYONE has a little OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) within themselves - one of mine obsessive features is over my money & my spendings.  This is why I give myself a monthly budget/allowance for any indulgences I want to enjoy for the month (be it a lushful girl's night out, new item of clothing, new music, etc.).    Well, let's just say that I've exceeded my budget several times in the past 5 months of 2004 already!  For the month of March, it was from bowling at Bowlmor Lanes & many cocktail-filled nights out with friends & friends of friends (those cosmopolitans sure add up!) but I can't complain, I was enjoying the company & having too much fun to regret my spendings!  For May, it was from my reminiscing about my college art student days & stocking up on 2 heavy-ass bags of art supplies in hopes that I could get in touch with that creative diva again (fyi - I got everything on sale, but I've yet to touch the contents of my 2 heavy-ass bags since...but I will - I promise!), on top of that - don't think my Mom didn't try to fancy it up for Mother's Day (what ever happened to "a kiss & a hug is all I need from my kids!")!    But this is why I love the introduction of a new month, it's a new beginning for my wallet, it's an opportunity to make amends for the all the overindulgences of the past.  Hmmm, Victoria's Secret is having their annual sale online so this is an opportune time to stock up on lingerie (pronounced ling-ghe-ree) & my summer wardrobe definitely needs new life...uh oh...June, here I come - credit card blazing!  Happy Spending!

      More random thoughts for today:     H e   a   t    W   a  v  e  :     I'm not a fan of tropical weather. This humidity has drained me of my energy & seems to be worsening my soreness &amp; cramps (from working out or hormones, I'm not sure - advil popping in effect). A Starbucks Caffe Vanilla Frappacino seemed to do the trick for a little while but the caffeine & icy goodness has worn off &amp; now I'm left a little sweaty & tired. I love autumn, I'm looking forward to multi-color crunchy leaves, sweaters, back to school (not for me) &amp; a crisp chilly breeze.    Da  nc  in  g   A  ny  wh  er  e?:   I've noticed that whenever I visit Virgin Megastore (especially the Union Square location), I always witness  "silent groovers"  - y'know the people at the listening stations that just feel the music they're sampling SO much that they just want to, got to, absolutely must....DANCE! It doesn't matter that nobody else can hear what they're hearing, it doesn't matter that the store is well-lit & there's nowhere to hide, it doesn't matter that your area of movement is restricted by the short cord that connects the headphones to the music wall, it just don't matter because they're feelin' the need to groove &amp; groove they will.  I'm never sure how to react to such people. In some ways I'm just embarrassed for them, I think to myself, "Whoa there fella! You're  really  getting down & everybody's staring!". However, another part of me is actually really inspired &amp; in awe of them because sometimes when I'm sampling a particularly good album, I long to do more than just tap my toes & stare blankly at the track listings on the back of the CD for 10 minutes, I want to bust a move too, but I don't because I fear what onlookers may think of me. Now, these "silent groovers", they just don't care, if they're feeling the music then they just go with it (&amp; some are actually good dancers too) -that kind of free-spiritedness & self-confidence is actually something to be admired, don't you think?  Perhaps I'll try my hand at being a "silent groover" when the next Britney album comes out, but I draw the line at singing along outloud at the listening stations...buy the album &amp; belt it out in the shower at home please, thanks!    N  i   H  a  o ,  Z  h  i   J  i  a  n !  Earlier this week on my way to work, a man handing out the free Metro newspapers shouted "Ni hao, ni hao!" to me as I was passing by (for those of you who don't know, "Ni hao" is Chinese for "hello") while waving the paper in front of me. He was clearly not Asian but he obviously saw my Asian face & thought this was a good move to get my attention &amp; make me want to take his newspaper. I was really put off by it but managed to rush by, refuse the paper & pretend I didn't hear him over my discman instead of getting confrontational. Yes, I'm Taiwanese/Chinese so "Ni hao" is part of my native tongue, but what if I was Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino, Japanese, etc. - would he even be able to tell the difference, does he know how to say hello in all those languages??? That just rubbed me the wrong way completely.  Then Friday as I was leaving my office, one of the delivery guys in our building said politely, as I sped by, "Zhi jian!" (Chinese for "good-bye"). Again, he wasn't Asian, but he assumed I was Chinese (though I've been told I look more Korean than Chinese). But because he said it so nicely &amp; it was Friday & I was happy to be going home, I flashed him a grin &amp; said "Bye, have a nice weekend!".  I was telling my mom about the 2 incidents & she told me this: You determine how you want to take these kind of things. If you go into it thinking "ignorant jerk" &amp; feel defensive that somebody's focusing in on your race, then you're just going to get mad everytime things like this happens. If you go into it thinking "awww, e for effort fella! Thanks for reaching out to my culture!" then you'll be more forgiving & relaxed about the situation having given these people the benefit of the doubt. This is coming from the same lady that, when a creepy guy passed us on the subway platform &amp; stopped to looked me up & down &amp; said "hiii" (in the slimiest way possible, in front of my MOM no less), said to me "Oh look, he's thinks you're pretty!". She's funny in that way, she plays naive but it's actually her very deliberate way of seeing the upside to people. It's pretty amazing.     Sho  wing   Appr  ecia   tion:   A few entries back, I wrote about having a really terrible day at work (oh wait, that was like EVERY entry...I'm trying to cut down, bear with me!) & finding a lot of comfort, support &amp; motivation after seeing my friends Nadia, Chou Ha, & Hilda that same night. I didn't really get to express my gratitude to them that day, so I finally sat down &amp; wrote an email to all of them (2 wks after the fact, but better late than never) to thank them & tell them about the steps I've taken thus far to make a career transition, I also pointed them towards this blog so they can read about themselves in that entry.  I figured, I can write about how great I think people are in this blog or in my personal journal, but why not just let them know how much I appreciate them directly? Sometimes, I have a hard time expressing those sort of things outloud because I don't want to overwhelm people with my sappyness or sentimentality (guilty as charged), but I find that writing is a good way of getting the message out there be it in an email, letter, card or an accessible blog!    Mini Disc Mania!:   I'm considering trading in my discman (via my PCRichards extended warranty plan...good thinkin' on my part, pat on the back!) for a minidisc player (it seems to fit the bill as far as size (3x3), price ($150 max), &amp; simplicity (it's like making a mix tape on your computer, no?))! But herein lies the problem, I am not so technologically knowledgeable! I can read instructions, I've figured out how to set my VCR (w/ a little help from   urlLink Sydney   - heyyyy girl!) recently, I'm jiggy wit it, I know the macarena...but I'm a little confused still.  First of all, I don't think MP3 players are for me because I don't need ALL my music on this one little microchip thingy, so I'm pretty certain the MD is the way to go for me. I've been reading reviews on  urlLink circuitcity.com , but it seems like people are either REALLY enthused about it after having owned it for all but 1 hour or they complain about technical things I don't quite understand. Then there's the different arguments, one person says it's easy to use & the sound is great, the other says they struggled with it &amp; the volume is too low. Then I wonder, do I even have a USB port on my computer, do I really need a radio & remote control for an additional $50, is 32X a fast transfer, what are these different formats to transfer under? WHOA!!! I know this isn't Sophie's Choice or anything, but I'm a little overwhelmed!  If anyone has any advice to offer, I would appreciate it greatly! (you can click  urlLink here  to Best Buy to see for yourself!)  Hope you all are having or have had a wonderful weekend! Laters!

      Two things you should know about me (incase you don't know already, also incase I haven't embarrassed myself enough already throughout my blog):    1. I have no composure or subtlety when it comes to celebrity sightings! I become a giddy little girl or a deer in headlights (depending on how far away they are & if they're able to hear me) but I've never approach anyone b/c I usually spot them doing "normal people stuff" &amp; really don't want to invade their private lives with my stuttering star-struckness so I just gawk from afar!    2. I LOVE reality television. I'm sure come fall, I'll be plugging for you all to watch "Survivor" (Jeff Probst is my hero!). I don't watch everything, I would surely become a hermit if I did, but when I get hooked, I'm HOOKED! Shows that I've been hooked by:  Survivor ,  Top Model  (I passed Season 2's winner, Yoanna, on 34th Street earlier this year...that was SUPER exciting!),  Paradise Hotel  (I still love to quote lines from that show & occasionally sing the theme song), &amp;    The Restaurant ...which brings me to my story!    Last night  urlLink  Sydney   & I finally decided to try  urlLink  Rocco's on 22nd   for dinner! Watching the show, I had always wanted to swing over to try Mama's meatballs, but I did not want camera time while dining...I prefer not to make my reality television debut in that way (covered in marinara sauce, buzzed on bellinis), plus I was put off by Rocco in all his schmoozing glory over his lady patrons (bluhhhhggg - I'm not a fan!). But after reading the reviews of Rocco's recent menu in Tuesday's Daily News & finding out that Rocco himself has been banned from the restaurant grounds (court order!), Syd &amp; I decided to give it a go.     Upon entering & being seated, I was discouraged having not seen one familiar face (our waitress was a pretty enough to be televised, but alas she was never featured on the show...she did have a very heavy Eastern European accent which would require subtitles had she acquired some camera time!). Then I saw him from afar, Uzay! Uzay the waiter turned floor manager!     Me: "Oh my god, it's Uzay...Sydney, it's Uzay!"    Sydney:  "Is that the French guy?" (by the way, his name is Lon Rosen)    Me:  "Ughhhh, no...but he was on the show too!"    Soon after, out of the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of bold black &amp; white vertical stripe pants of none other than Tony, the head chef!     Me: "Oh my god, it's Tony...you remember Tony! I love Tony! I thought Rocco fired him...but he's still here! And he's wearing the black & white pants!"    Sydney:  "Okay, now you're just stalking them."     Then I spotted a little old lady by the bar...it was Mama DiSpirito! That's when my fingers started pointing (as covertly as possible) &amp; I was shaking my fists like they were maracas in excitement!    Me: "Sydney, it's MAMA! Look at her, she's so cute - I love Mama, I want to give her a hug...would that be too intrusive? I think she just looked at me, Mama just looked at me!"    Sydney:  Silently shaking her head at me...I know, I'm embarrassing!    Well, apparently I wasn't the only one that was star-struck by Mama, as other customers approached her eager to see her big smile, get autographs, take pictures, receive hugs & kisses on the cheek! Soon after the photo op (unfortunately, I was without camera last night), she disappeared. I was afraid she had left for the night, but then she reappeared &amp; before I knew it, I felt her hand on my back as she came over to greet us as we were finishing up dessert!     Me: "HI MAMA!!!"    Sydney:  "Your meatballs...they're unbelievable!"    Me: "I'm so glad we got to see you!"     That's when she leaned in for hugs & kisses.   M  a  m  a   D  i  S  p  i  r  i  t  o  is an amazing lady, she had such a  warm  &amp; sweet nature about her, I couldn't help but feel like she was my own grandma! She held both of our hands tightly in hers during the whole conversation as if we were her family - it was a wonderful, meeting her made my week! I am a happy happy camper!

      I'm not so focused this week, but here are a couple of random thoughts:    Bill Clinton at the Democratic Convention:   I watched Clinton's speech at the Democratic Convention Monday night (which is surprising for me because I usually turn away or change the channel from anything political), but I have to say, Bill had me captivated. There's 2 sides to every argument, I'm well aware of that, but I couldn't help but be swayed by Clinton's speech - it made me want to run to the ballots & vote for Kerry/Edwards...damn, he's good! I have to admit, I really don't know much about Kerry, I did see him looking very  urlLink  Wil  ly   Wo  nk  a &amp;   the   Cho  col  at  e F  ac  to  ry   in a turquoise "safe suit" at the Space Shuttle Discovery which made me giggle to no end, but I'm intrigued enough&nbsp;now to tune in to his speech in Boston later this week.    Good Mood Magoo:   I've been in a surprisingly sunny mood at work for the past couple of days, I think it's caught some people off guard! I'm no   urlLink "De   urlLink  bb  ie   Do  wn  er"  &nbsp; or anything, but my feelings are usually written on my face & hard to hide (especially under recent circumstances).&nbsp; The boss is on the west coast on business this week, & the manipulative bitch is on vacation...therefore the frantic nasty vibe that they give off has been lifted &amp; I've been taking extra long lunches (just shooting the s**t with other coworkers) & jetting out of here before 6pm. I'm also newly invigorated to work on my portfolio &amp; happy to find that my creativity is still alive & kicking, it gives me hope of better opportunities to come..    BEADS!!!:   I bought beads this week too...faceted  garnet  tear drops, they're so pretty!&nbsp; FYI - I have an obsession with beads (jewelry making) & yarn (knitting). I guess it's my form of "creative meditation"...I&nbsp;get so engulfed & focused&nbsp;by my little projects sometimes, I love winding up with something beautiful to wear in the aftermath (if I do say so myself!).&nbsp; I've been encouraged by a lot of people to go around & try to sell my jewelry at some downtown boutiques, but that's a venture I've yet to take on.....but definitely something I'd like to pursue in the future.    Summer Rain:   It's been   r a i n i n  g  a lot in New York for the past week &amp; I've been getting caught in it a lot though my umbrella does very little&nbsp;to keep&nbsp;the hem of my jeans & my shoes dry.&nbsp; Flip flops are usually a bad idea in this wet scenario, however I've delighted in walking through puddles or mini-streams of my very hilly suburban neighborhood in my flip flops just to feel the cool water wash over my feet.&nbsp; I realize this might be unsanitary, but you only live once & there's always antibacterial soap!&nbsp;   Random...I know, but try to see the depth in it!&nbsp; What...no depth...oh, my bad!&nbsp;

      I'm so tired...& it's only 10:30pm...I'm getting to be a really old 25 year old!    July  is coming to an end (okay, one more week but still...).&nbsp; I can't believe how fast this month went.&nbsp; This seems to have been the month of "reunions" or "reconnecting"&nbsp;(of sorts): My sister (who's currently home after a 1 week vacation in Prague & Berlin via Contiki tours), my three Parsons fashion alum friends (Nadia, Chou Ha &amp; Hilda), Mr. Volpe (my professor), & just this week I ran into another fellow alum on the train (we were acquaintances in school &amp; lately we keep running into each other...strangely enough, we always seem to have the same issues with our work places.&nbsp; She's also given me some good advice about job hunting seeing as she's in the same boat) & I've been exchanging emails with Ellen,&nbsp;an old friend from high school &nbsp;(it was her 2 year wedding anniversary this past Wednesday, to her high school sweetheart).   Today I had lunch with my mom & sister at  T  h  e   C  h  e  e  s  e  c  a  k  e   F a  c  t  o  r   y .&nbsp; Did I ever tell you guys how much I  LOVE  The Cheesecake Factory...I love it, I do...but I always eat WAY too much & feel really terrible afterwards when I'm wobbling around like a pregnant lady!&nbsp; I highly recommend their Factory Nachos, Chicken & Biscuits, Santa Fe salad, &amp; any cheesecake (except key lime), though I've heard that you just can't go wrong with anything you order there.&nbsp;    Anyhow, we went to the mall afterwards & guess what I saw.....somebody was selling  painted  hermit crabs, oh no - not just the shells so you can put&nbsp;it on your shelf for decoration,&nbsp;but with the   live  little fella still inside the shells.&nbsp;&nbsp;What the....?&nbsp; First of all why are you messing with  Mo  th  er   Na  tu  re?&nbsp;   Secondly, the paint job was terrible...just tacky &...not pretty!&nbsp; Third, I'm no PETA protestor (I eat meat, I wear leather, but I'm draw the line at fur) or anything but that's just wrong!&nbsp; I want to&nbsp;go back to&nbsp;the mall next weekend with picket signs & chant (by myself)  "Let the hermit crabs go, let their true colors show!" ...yea, I'm amazed by my sheer improvisational brilliance as well!&nbsp; My sister thought that the painted hermit crabs were part of the "makeover trend" with all these plastic surgery/home makeover/fashion-lifestyle makeover shows.....hmmm, she's got a point - but hermit crabs!?!&nbsp; That ain't right!    So...who's coming with me next weekend?&nbsp;

      Okay...I guess it's all been leading up to this, my supervising designer "Jay-Z", who was on maternity leave, has resigned from Dinky Co. She had asked to work 4 days a week & I guess the a**hole (my boss that is) wasn't willing to see the value of her as an employee so he declined her request &amp; now she's gone. This  saddens  me, it  angers  me   & gives me a sense of  hopelessness .  Though I was pretty firm on resigning myself before the year's end, I thought  at least  her return to the office would  brighten  my remaining months here...now I know that it's just going to be a really rough remaining months.      I know you're all just saying - if you're that unhappy, why don't you just quit? Of course, I considered it, I considered just completely  f   l ip  pin  g   ou t   on everyone that pisses me off here & storming out - but that's not my personality.....all that's good &amp; empowering fun in the movies, but in real life...I don't want my actions to negatively effect all the people I  do  like &  care  about here. Plus, to not have anything lined up beforehand...I just can't bring myself to it. Call me a wuss...but I need security. As much as I've been struggling here, I'd still like to bow out  gr  ac  ef  ul  ly , y'know?    I had requested a 2 week vacation at the end of October to Taiwan (a necessary & obligatory trip, not that it won't be fun too), I had planned on staying at Dinky Co. till then but now that seems like  far  too long.....I'm going to have to do things in a mad dash now.....in hopes that a new company would be willing to take me under their  wings  & value me enough to let me take a 2 week off so quickly. I don't know how it'll work out.....my head's in a tailspin now &amp; I spent a good 20 minutes in the bathroom trying to figure out my plan of action....    Okay...bear with me, I'm just thinking outloud:    1. No more staying late at work -  go home & prep  for job hunting    2. Be  discreet  about your disappointment, nobody needs to know you're leaving till you're  actually  leaving (for real).    3. Start  networking  (I HATE doing this but it's necessary right now).    4. Have some composure woman, quit bitching &  just do it !    5. Tell yourself everything will be alright...ain't nobody gonna break my stride, ain't nobody gonna hold me down...OH NO, I've got to keep on  mo  oo  vi  ng ...    6. You're a  good designer , a  hard worker , you are a HUGE  asset to the industry  -  work it ,  work it !    Oooooh, that was actually good therapy just now, I feel  calmer .....okay, I better go eat lunch. I wish I could take tomorrow off but I've gotta save my "personal &amp; sick" days for interviews now! Wish me luck.    PS. I can't believe in all my tailspin stress I managed to make such a colorful blog presentation! Damn, I am a good artist (ha ha!).    PSS.  For some reason the spell check is not working...so please excuse any spelling errors I might have made!

      It's official, my boss is an a**hole.  Actually this pertains to a couple of people in Dinky Co., I personally believe that there's a nice way to say & do everything  especially  in a professional atmosphere...I don't care how long you've been here, how much power or money you have, there's something called  civility  that is seriously lacking in these people & I'm hoping karma bites them in the ass one day, DAMN, I really wish I was a voodoo priestess (extreme - yes, but I'm heated right now!   "Thinnahhh" ).  I'll cut off my bitter ranting now - sorry folks...I wish I didn't have to bitch about work so often either.....onto other things now...    I ran into one of my design illustration professors this morning, Mr. Volpe!  He was smoking outside one of these 7th Avenue buildings as I was rushing to work but I  had to stop & chat since he was one of my favorite professors (when my sewing maching got stolen out of my locker, he lent me his for the whole last semester)!  He quit teaching at Parsons a year ago after decades of  working there (of course, he's an alum too).  Apparently the whole fashion curriculum had changed drastically after we, the class of 2001, graduated, to the point that it became "unfocused & unethical" &amp; that's when the department lost all their long-time staffers - what a shame for the new classes!  Now he's back in the fashion industry "making money & buying fabulous things" - haha (I guess Parson's doesn't pay very well...ironic considering the ridiculous tuition!)!  It was so wonderful to see him again, he's one of the professors that "made" my experience at Parsons & helped me grow as a designer!  I'm  really happy to have seen him today!    Sometimes I really miss being in school.....but then again I like getting a paycheck & not stressing about homework too (though  I'm stressing about a**holes at work nowadays)...& don't even ask me when was the last time I touched my new sewing machine!      Happy mid-week to you all!

      I actually worked on my portfolio yesterday, as promised. It felt good...like I was closer to God...okay, not really but it was still fulfilling. I still have some creativity within me, which was a relief, it was like "Oh, there you are! I was afraid I had lost you forever &amp; ever!" (ironic that I can lose my creativity in a design job...).   I also caught tid bits of the VH1 "   urlLink I Love the 90's   " series - that made me laugh my arse off! Does anyone remember  C  o  l  o  r   M  e   Badd  (I think it was Bad with 2 D's)...or Snow for that matter (you remember "Informer", I bring him up because he looked EXACTLY like the lead singer from CMB). A little "I wanna sex you up" or "I adore, mi amore"...good times, good times.&nbsp; My favorite was Mr. Rico Suave himself,  Gerado ! Oh, what a scuzzy guy in his 90's pirate gear, he was just oily beyond belief!   They talked about  Backstreet Boys  too...I don't think it will surprise anyone when I say that I was once a HUGE fan of BSB (that was 1998, so I was in college at the time...yup, a very old teeny bopper)! I was a fan to the point of being anti-Nsync at the time, I was one of those big dorks that insisted that the BSB had MUCH&nbsp;tighter choreography&nbsp;than the Nsynchers! Yea...it's true &amp; now you know, don't ask me why I'm chose to embarrass myself just now!   My favorite commentaries on "I Love the 90's" are from Michael Ian Black, he was in NBC's "Ed", &amp; for those of you who are hip to it, he was also on the MTV skit show "  The State  " in the early 90's! A little " Doug...I'm outta heeere ", " Bumblebee Tuna ", " Barry &amp; Levon...awwwww yeah ", " I wanna dip my balls in it ", " P  orcupine Racetrack ", or " The Jew, The Italian, &amp; The Red-head Gay "...I hope somebody knows what I'm talking about - Sydney, I know you've got my back here! That was an  EXCELLENT  show!   Okay, I better run - as promised, I'm not staying at work late anymore &amp; my portfolio beckons (along with the treadmill!). I think I've shared enough deep dark dorky secrets for today! Have a wonderful week one &amp; all.  &nbsp;  PS - I'm going a little crazy with these new color tools, huh?!&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm &nbsp;just playing around...I'll try to keep it under control next time!

      The header is a line from urlLink  "Pieces of Me",  the new Ashlee Simpson song (I'm at a loss for headers today!).&nbsp; I am currently&nbsp;listening to her new CD "Autobiography" via  urlLink MTV's  "the leak".&nbsp; I have to admit, even though she annoys me a little (why does she have a reality show???), &nbsp;I really like this song (I'm iffy to the rest of her album) &amp;&nbsp;I've been singing along to it all weekend (I've told y'all numerous times about my cheese factor...okay, you can stop laughing at me now!&nbsp; Danks!). &nbsp;  I'm really sick of writing about work on a daily basis, I've looked back on my blog &amp; it seems like I've been fighting &amp; struggling at work for way too long now.&nbsp; And yet another incident (this time with the big boss himself) on Friday afternoon has pushed me to the&nbsp;brink of &nbsp;"F**k it".&nbsp; I had an epiphany (yea, that took long enough) that my work is changing me into someone I don't like, I was so out-of-character monster bitchy&nbsp;to one of my coworkers (who has never wronged me in any way) on Friday, it made me feel absolutely horrible.&nbsp; All this for what?!?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Luckily, I had dinner plans with some of my Parsons fashion folk Friday night, three&nbsp;lovely ladies&nbsp;that I spent SO much time with senior year (we basically lived in the design studio 6-7 days a week &amp; kept each other sane with laughter), I consider them my sisters.&nbsp; Initially I didn't want to bring my work drama &nbsp;into our dinner conversation but I think they sensed I needed to vent (they know me too well) so they encouraged me to talk about it.&nbsp; They unanimously told me "Oh girl, you need to get out of there!", which is exactly what  urlLink Sydney  said to me on Monday, &amp; what my mom told me yesterday.&nbsp; Okay, so that's 5 people I trust most all telling me the same thing...well, if that didn't spark&nbsp;some action&nbsp;I don't know what will!&nbsp; I'm working on my portfolio all day today.  &nbsp;  My time with the girls, over sushi &amp; sake-cocktails, was really wonderful.&nbsp; We&nbsp;don't get to see each other too often but I always feel REALLY happy, supported &amp; appreciated in their company.&nbsp; They gave me really good advice about job hunting &amp; updating my portfolio which was really encouraging &nbsp;&amp; motivating.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadia, Chou Ha, &amp; Hilda (their real names)&nbsp;put a really big smile on my face which was a nice end to a tough day.&nbsp; Also, on my train ride home that night,&nbsp;I witnessed&nbsp;fireworks over Shea Stadium which I took to be a sign of better things to come (you gotta find it where you can, right!?) though I'm sure the spectacle was for the purpose of kicking off some sporting event too!  &nbsp;  Okay, I better go make lunch &amp; get back to belting out to Ashlee (honestly, I&nbsp;think I sound pretty damn good!) &nbsp;&amp; channeling the creative diva in me...she's in there somewhere!&nbsp; Hommmmmmm......Hope everyone's had or is having a good weekend.   PS - Look at all these new blogger functions...pertty impressive, what would be even more impressive is if I'm able to make use of them!&nbsp; I'll try!

      We were talking about our childhood habits at lunch today at work.  I guess the topic came up when all the mommies started talking about their little ones & the funny things that the rugrats do (yes - kids, childbirth, pregnancy, & schooling are constant topics of conversation in this, the fertile crescent, that is my office).  My coworker, "Rosie" (not her real name), revealed that she sucked her thumb till she was 9 years old, it was thumb in mouth with one hand, while the other hand grasped on to a pink Care Bear for dear life.  The bear was so worn out that it's little arm ripped off, but that was okay with little "Rosie", because then she could yank the arm off & smell the stuffing inside which was supposedly fragrant after all those years.  She made a conscious effort to ditch both the thumb-sucking habit & Care Bear when she reached the age of 9.  The hand was lowered away from the mouth & the pink Care Bear was trashed...till that night when she had a relapse & adopted her sister's blue Care Bear instead.  "Rosie" still sleeps with the blue Care Bear to this day (she's 24) & when I asked her if she was going to bring it to our company trip at the Poconos in late August, she looked at me as if I were crazy & responded, "Go to a strange place without my Care Bear...come on!"  Oops, my bad...what was I thinking!!!  I love hearing other people's childhood stories, especially when accompanied by pictures (My senior year of Parsons, my friends & I would all bring in childhood pictures & pass them around during draping class...it made us feel like one big family & nothing's better than seeing minature versions of your friends in late 70's, early 80's clothes!).    I also love when my mom tells me stories of my early childhood that I don't remember.  My favorite one is about the time that I was a baby & my mom cut her long hair to be a short bob (partly due to my sister's hair twirling habit, back then it was my mom's hair, today, it's her own...she's 27 & still twirling away).  As the story goes, she came home with a bob & I took one look at her & turned away to ignore her, when she picked me up I continued to turn my head away & avoid eye contact in that "I don't know you but I'll let you hold me" kind of way.  As the hours passed I must have realized...hey, this chick sounds like my mom, smells like my mom, feels like my mom...when it finally clicked that "hey, she IS my mom!", she said I was all over her & couldn't stop giggling.  I had a thumb-sucking habit as a child too, I remember my left thumb would get all raisiny at times but I just didn't care.  My mom use to put nail polish on my thumb so I would be repelled by the taste, but I would just chip off the polish with my teeth & go on my merry little way.  I sucked my thumb till I was 6 years old, my Grandma had promised to give me a big present if I quit...I don't even remember if that offer was ever fulfilled...hmmm, I think I gotta make a phone call to Taiwan tonight - time to pay up Grandma!    I had a stuffed duck when I was little too, he was yellow, round, fluffy, with an orange beak & sad little eyes.  He made his way into many photographs (as the focal point as I presented him with my Vanna White hand gestures...I didn't even know of Wheel of Fortune at the time, I guess it just came naturally). I lost him during one of our family vacations, I still remember running around the hotel room on the last day of our trip frantically looking for him & mourning his loss for weeks to follow - till this day I still wonder where he could be.  My sister gave me a beanie baby named Quackers several years ago...she was trying to replace my little childhood friend, but it just ain't the same thing!  Sigh...those were the days when life was simple & uncomplicated.  I'm a sucker for reminiscing....whoa, how time has passed with me clicking away here!  Okay, the treadmill awaits, I'm out!  TGIF manyanamama!

      Hello, Hello one & all...I'm happy to announce that despite this dreary weather, my sanity is back, well...for the most part.  Or at least I'm a lot more emotionally stable than I was last week, the funk has been lifted, I am reborn anew...(dramatic overkill?)  Last night I had dinner with my FOF (friend of friends), Sydney, at California Pizza Kitchen (up by Bloomingdales), she listened as I vented about work & we laughed over...I don't even know what, but we laughed a lot which was refreshing after a week of sulking.  And even though we got caught in the pouring rain afterwards (our umbrellas did very little to keep us dry), it was still good times all around.    I'm not sure if I'm the only one left in the office....hold on, I'm trying to listen for the stirrings of another......nothing.  I might be.  I'm not staying much longer, the treadmill awaits me at home - I'm jumping back on the wagon of exercise & I'm quitting this staying late at work by myself crap!    Hope everyone had a wonderful weekend!

      Sigh (of relief), it's finally Friday!  I hope to not be bitching & moaning about work next week, though I'm bracing myself for the boss's return to the office, he's been overseas for a month now, & there are some  issues  which have occurred recently that can bring out his volatile personality - oh what fun!    I'm gonna try my damnedest (s?)to use this weekend to invigorate my spirit.  This is my plan of action to  Alleviate "The Funk"  (as in well-being, not odor, I've addressed that already!):    1. Dance Therapy - I'm gonna dance my ass off...not in a club, I can't deal with that atmosphere right now, but in the comfort of my own home - bust it I will!    2. Sweat Therapy - I always feel more empowered after working out, I've been neglecting that because of late work days...gotta get back on the wagon!  3. Music Therapy - I started this morning with Kylie Minogue's "Fever" CD, it did the trick during my commute!  I will also have to put Christina Aguilera's "Fighter" on high rotation again - it's an empowering song & I ain't ashamed to say it!  (By the way, did anyone see her in Elle magazine, I think she looks phenomenal with the strawberry blonde hair!  Yeah, she's diva-esque, but I think she's fierce!)  4. Retail Therapy - I know, it's very Cher in "Clueless", but it helps sometimes!  Hopefully I don't blow my whole July budget...I promise to be responsible...unless there's more sales...  5. Mom & Friend Therapy - They can always cheer me up, help me put things into perspective, make me forget about my worries, or "D - All of the above".  6. Movie & TV Therapy - I might have to break out "Shawshank Redemption" again, I LOVE that movie!  7. Boston Market Therapy - Hmmmm, sweet potatoe...rotisserie chicken...cornbread...mix veggies.......................oh sorry, where was I?!  8. Laughing Therapy - Just learn to laugh about all this work drama, hahahahahahaha, those crazy kids at Dinky Co.!  9. Water Therapy - A bath with the works or a really long shower will help wash away the negativity...oh, if it were only so easy!  10. Art Therapy - I don't know if I'll have time for it (what with all the dancing, eating, showering, hysterical laughing, etc), but I know being creative will do me good!  Okay, that's me weekend plan.  I wish you all a pleasant weekend!

      I think I'm a lot worse at hiding my feelings than I thought I was.  A coworker pulled me aside today & asked why I was "in a funk", to which I responded with a "hmmm, nothing work related" (a total lie, though the intensity in what I'm feeling is probably heightened due to hormones) then I proceeded to turn a bright shade of red & my eyes welled up with tears as I tried to convince her that I was emotionally stable...meanwhile I'm thinking "oh my god, do I have no emotional control whatsoever!?"  I was so embarrassed by the whole situation...but I just couldn't deal with my own feelings today.  I know people here mean well, I know they don't want me to pull these ridiculous hours - but it's my time in this time alone in the office where I feel I can really get things accomplished, at my own pace, on my own terms.  I think they misinterpret it as me being a workaholic martyr.....but I don't want a trophy for my long hours, I don't do it to show off my commitment to this place, I don't do it so I have a reason to bitch, I just want to do my job without interruptions & without feeling like I'm being watched & judged on every little thing.  I'm so glad tomorrow's Friday!  I seriously need a break (& to think this was a short week!).

      I'm in a crappy crappy mood today!  Let me apologize beforehand for my bitching & moaning, it's just one of those days...I'm human.    I'm so fed up with the power struggle & bullshietto that is my workplace, I'm starting to feel like I crack under this sort of pressure & my level of patience has dipped drastically over the past 2 months...perhaps it's due to hormones that I'm feeling this way (yes, I'm refering to the crimson wave), at least I hope that's the case (though yes, I'm still aspiring towards a career transition once I get my s**t together to update my portfolio...which has become a little dated since fashion & trends can change so often)!  I won't go into detail about the drama, I've been grumbling to myself all day already like a crazy person, there's really no point in writing about it!  This blog site was giving me all kinds of trouble yesterday, it erased an entire entry I had diligently typed up...perhaps my best writing ever...perhaps the most controversial of blogs...perhaps the most profound live-altering thing ever written...okay, not really - but still, what if it was & now it's just gone!?!  I guess you can't complain since this is a rare occurence w/ blogger/blogspot, & I do appreciate this little venue to express myself.  So as I had said in my previous entry - my weekend was spent in Boston with my sister & my mom.  Well, y'know that 48 hour expiration I mentioned, apparently I was overshooting it...my sister got all pissy with my mom & I 2 hours after our arrival because we were being too "wishy-washy" about dinner, & when I said "I really don't see any reason to get so mad over this!", she snapped back at me "I'm mad, I have a right to feel mad"...I kept quiet at that point but thought to myself - well, yea, you do - you're entitled to feel whatever you want to feel, but if you're going to sweat over something so trivial & small, then I feel like you're making our short time together less enjoyable, & that, in turn, makes me think you're selfish.  We eventually hashed it out, w/ my mom attempting to play mediator/therapist (she is a huge advocate of Dr. Phil & self-help books), & managed to get along fine for the rest of the weekend.  I love my sister, I admire her in so many ways, she is incredibly smart & strong, she is well-liked by all her friends & coworkers, but I feel like she makes her life so much more difficult than it needs to be that I really can't deal with it sometimes.  Sigh...again, feeling that might be heightened due to hormones.  The office is quiet again (I'm locking up again), thank freakin' god...perhaps now I can do my work in peace.  I'm hoping 2 Advils (my drug of choice, not to be abused!) & a good night's rest will lead to a better Thursday.

      Yea, it's Friday AND we have a long weekend ahead of us!  Apparently, today was "bring your kids into work" day for all the parents here at Dinky Co.  There were kids running all about in this office, wanting me to draw with them, asking me if I needed any photocopies (so they would have an excuse to photocopy their faces or hands in the meantime), showing me their discolored tongues from Starburst Sours...needless to say, it was hard to get any work done (hence why I am locking up again today)!  I didn't realize that babysitting was part of my job as a designer!  I do love kids though, my coworker's 16 month old daughter gave me a hug & a kiss on the cheek which totally made my day!  She got my biological clock ticking, before I came to my senses...Whoa Nelly, it's getting hot in herre - I'm 25, no man I can see myself having a family with in the horizons, & in a lot of ways, I still feel like a kid myself!    This weekend I will be visiting my sister in Boston for Independence Day.  It ought to be fun, as long as I'm outta there by Monday since my sister & I have a 48 hour expiration with each other - in that we can get along wonderfully for 2 days, anything longer than that & we get our bitch on!  We are so similar in SO many ways (we laugh at the same stupid things & we're both stubborn & a little OCD), but at the same time we are complete opposites (she's very driven, academic, & looking towards the future & I'm more creative, laid-back & living in the moment - it's not to say there's a right & wrong, we're just different).  She likes to claim that I've gotten "sassy" within the past 2 years, but in reality, it's just me trying to hold my ground with her & perhaps give her a taste of her own medicine!  I love her though, I'm looking forward to hanging out with her & perhaps having another one of our "dorkathon dance-off" showdowns (this is when we break out our cheesiest moves...I ALWAYS win because I am what choreographers would refer to as "In the Zone", yea Britney - I feel you girl!).  I hope to see some fireworks Sunday night, I don't know what we're doing yet but I LOVE seeing fireworks live.  You know about my love for all things pertty & sparkly!  Have a wonderful weekend & holiday folks!

      It's a sad day.  My best good friend, Sydney's, cat has passed away.  I have to admit, I'm not really a cat person (I have a love/fear relationship with animals, in that I love them & I'll gush over how cute they are, but there's an innate fear that I'll get bitten, hissed at, attacked, or scratched).  I'm also allergic to cats, but for some reason Maxine never seemed to bother my sinuses.    Maxine was a sweet & gentle cat, she liked to come visit me on Sydney's couch when I would sleep over after a night out drinking & dancing...she once swatted at the windows nearby in middle of the night which caused me to wake up in a panic thinking a burglar was trying to get into Syd's place from outside.  I could have sworn Maxine chuckled at me at that point "Sucka!".  She would also stare at me early in the morning, wondering if I would be so kind as to feed her & when I would turn the other way, she'd jump over me & stare at me some more...making me very much aware of her persistance!  She was one smart kitty!  It always warmed my heart when she would lie next to me, & purrr as I attempted to give her a "kitty massage".  She didn't like it when I flicked her little ears though (I know - I'm terrible, but she had the funniest little ears!), but she never lashed out, she would just get up & leave, graciously excusing herself from my presence.  I will miss her too.  Take care Sydney, y'know I'm here if you need me!

      Check out my new Divawho? Header - isn't it beeeauuutifulll!   It's brought to you by the creator of  urlLink  Candy Blue Kite   - a Ms. Sydney if you're nasty, as she one of the most computer-proficient lads on in this Western hemisphere (sorry, the Japanese has you beat Syd!)! She both created it & helped me set it up over the weekend (by helped, I mean I sat there baffled &amp; bewildered as she guided me to click on this & that), &amp; now it's here for everyone's viewing pleasure!   Ta-DAHHHH!   I had a wonderful weekend. The weather was beautiful (just right, sunny but cool enough to wear a light jacket) & I got to relax &amp; spend time with 2 of my favorite people, my mom & Sydney.  Saturday was spent window shopping in the Union Square &amp; Soho area w/ Sydney. We met up at Virgin Megastore (no silent groovers in sight...damn!) & swung by  urlLink  Utrecht   where I picked up some gouache for my portfolio work (Windsor & Newton is the brand of choice), then came  Air Market  where I never buy anything but it's always good for a looksie of Japanese trends. Then we began our trek to Soho with bubble teas (ala  urlLink  Saints Alp Teahouse  ) in hand (my personal favorite is #8 - coffee & black tea frothy melange).   Lunch took place at  urlLink  Bar 89  , one of my favorite restaurants in the city just because I can't get enough of those faux-exhibitionist bathrooms! I got "my usual" there - Bar 89 Club with bacon & avocado (hmmmm!). After lunch, we paid a visit to the neighboring  Leekan Design  a characteristically creaky Soho store that carries an assortment of overpriced import novelty goodies & "antiques" from Asia. I was in the mood to make a small purchase, so shelled out $3 for a small opalescent glass egg to start my collection (get it, "shelled out" - I "crack" myself up! Oh, there I go again!). These eggs are meant to be placed together in a small fountain of water which brings out a luminous quality about them - it's very zen &amp; should have some good feng-shui effects for the home, I intend to buy one for every visit to Soho I make in the following year.  After hunting down a Mr. Softy truck for frosty dessert cones, Syd & I hopped a train to my humble abode in the island that is long, where we vegetated in front of the tv &amp; computer before retiring for the night. On Sunday, lunch was had at one of my favorite eateries,  urlLink  Boston Market   - mmmm,  SWEET POTATOES !!!! We then swung by the mall for more window shopping & to view the painted hermit crabs (you remember "Let the Hermit Crabs Go, Let their true colors show!"...go to Sydney's blog so you can see for yourself why I have such an issue with the paint job on these little fellas!), it still ain't right. After Crabby Island (that's the crafty name of the stand in which they sell these aesthetically-challenged little fellas), we were off to  Jones Beach  for a four mile walk along the boardwalk before heading seaside for some people-watching along the waves - there were toddlers in soggy diapers, a middle age man with the  fuchsia  speedo (again, see Syd's blog for the speedo in all it's glory - I say YES to speedos!), pasty nerd guy with the thick frame glasses (I can safely say I will not put up a fight for his everlasting lovin', Syd, he's all yours!), & masses of people getting knocked down by a crashing waves.  It was delightful, but now it's Monday again &amp; I've been yawning & a little unfocused all day long...it must be the effects of the shopping, the sun &amp; beachy breeze. But I've had me a good weekend & feel invigorated to get through this week in as mellow a fashion as possible! I hope you've all had as wonderful a weekend as well &amp; I wish you a speedy week till the next weekend!

       Warning : I'm establishing a new practice here at Divawho?  From now on, I will highlight any of my 'bitching about work' writing in RED, so for those of you who are sick of hearing me bitch & moan about Dinky Co., simply skip the following red paragraph completely, I understand.  This practice will also help me to keep this to a minimum b/c I certainly don't want this blog overrun with red paragraphs!  For those of you who are so patient as to read through my trials & tribulations...I thank you, I hope you  can't  relate!  Oh, & I'm taking steps towards my resignation &amp; starting anew somewhere happier & healthier.   I'm having an eye-rolling day, something that I've become very guilty of doing at work (undercover, of course!). Is it mean-spirited of me to want the folks here to struggle when I leave? Let me explain...I don't want Dinky Co. to go out of business & I don't want anyone to lose their job, but I would like for some people to have to do more than what they do now, things that   I  would normally do, & get so buried in it (even if it's for a short period) so maybe, JUST MAYBE, they'll realize "Wow, we've lost a really hard worker, she did a lot for this company!". I guess this is a result of me feeling taken for granted &amp; overlooked here. I really can't believe the level of bulls**t that consumes this place - the power struggles, the back-talking & stabbing, stifled communication, &amp; utter lack of professionalism & respect...I feel like I'm still in high school, it's nauseating. I wish it didn't get to me, though the intensity of which I'm feeling these things has dissipated after I made the decision to leave. I realize no work place is perfect...but I'm pretty certain there are better places than here.   Okay, onto other things:  My weekend was good, though I have very little tolerance for humidity & it caused fatigue &amp; sluggishness, sore muscles, & insomnia. I was sipping on the frozen drinks at every given chance (non alcoholic, though a  Waikiki Wally's  pina colada scorpion bowl would have been dreammmy in this heat (shared amongst friends, of course - I'm not THAT much of a lush!), the drink of choice was definitely the aformentioned (on Saturday's entry)  Starbucks   Caffe Vanilla Frappacino  (it was THAT good that I have to mention it twice!).  I finally saw "Jay-Z" (my ex-coworker/supervisor) this weekend, heck - now that she's resigned from Dinky Co. her identity can be revealed as  Joyce .  She's a lovely person & I have no complaints about her so there you go - no more confusion between her &amp; Big Pimpin!  Joyce has a new car with a GPS mapping system, it was very cool...there's a little computer screen with an eagle-eye mapping system & it talks to give you directions - "start to merge right, your exit is coming up"...Kit, is that you? She's in good spirits, trying to start up her own contemporary line, I haven't seen any of her new designs yet but I'm certain it's great stuff , she's an incredibly talented designer &amp; an extrodinarily hard & efficient worker...I wish I could have worked with her longer.  I had dinner with three lovely ladies before Tuesday Trivia last night (yea, I go there too) - Ms. Sydney, Ms. Sarah, &amp; Ms. Paula (as in Bristow, Jessica Parker, & Abdul...I'm very Hollywood, you didn't realize?). The place to be was the wonderfully zen    urlLink  GOBO  , & though I always feared vegetarian restaurants after having really terrible fever-esque reaction to my first vegan restaurant meal ever (nobody else got sick...it was just me!), Gobo's got a lovely assortment of yummeries that have help me to conquer my fear!  Last night, due to the incoming crimson wave, I ordered Yam & Yucca fries (fried goodness), Scallion Pancakes (more fried goodness), &amp; the Tropical Mystic Smoothie!  For those of you who read  urlLink  Candy Blue Kite  , you've already read Sydney's raves over this delightful beverage...& it's really THAT good, especially on a hot day like yesterday!  Gobo is a beautiful restaurant with a really friendly wait staff & quality food for a moderate price...2 Thumbs up!  Oh...the company, I got so caught up in the food, I almost forgot about the lovely ladies!  Yes - the conversation was fun & delightful (they let me vent a little about more petty turn of events at work - thank you ladies for lending an ear &amp; being so supportive!  I really appreciate it!), & they all made me laugh &amp; smile & ready to face the heat awaiting us outside.   Well, it's getting a little late & I should go home &amp; attempt to make friends with the treadmill despite this heat.  Is it Friday yet???
