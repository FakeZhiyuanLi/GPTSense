      I got my sleepy self up this morning to take my Boo to the airport at 3:30 am. I'm really glad he decided to see his best friend, but I have the feeling that Craig will convince my Boo to move down to Georgia in the near future. After all they are best friends and have lived on the same block for the past 20 years. When Craig decided to move to ATL he was crushed, and he even cried. Yes, this is the man I would like to spend the rest of my life with and father my children, so of course I would go with him to Georgia, but not for another 4 years.   I must finish my second Bachelor's degree in NYS first and I would like to at least get a year of work experience under my belt before I relocate. Let me stop jumping the gun and just wait to see what happens when he returns.  On a lighter note, my homegirl got into the Master's Program at Brooklyn College and I'm thrilled. My friends and I all got our stuff together and the older we get the more productive we get. So hopefully on Friday we can make it a girls night in and get the Pinot Grigio flowing and watch some DVD's.  Oh wow...I just realized that the BBQ at the house is in a week and a half and I have yet to tell Jasmin about Abby and Junior. So let me start from the beginning. When I was in college Jasmin was my roommate. One weekend this guy named Junior came to visit her (they know each other from grade school), she had a crush on him since then and decided to act on it. So he and I meant and that was that. Well they didn't hit it off after all and I didn't she Junior until March of this year. We all went to a party at the Roxy and I was toasted from the alcohol, but I thought I seen Abby speaking to Junior (Abby is my roommate). After a week or two Abby is telling me how she meant this guy at the Roxy and he drives a Lexus, has a good job and is a bit freaky. But every time he came to the house I was at my Boo's house. Finally he came over one night when I was home and Melly happened to be there chillin as well. So when he walked in and Abby introduced us, I said "Junior, oh I know him already, he is a friend of Jasmins'." Well Melly bust out laughing and so did I. Maybe Abby took offense but hey Brooklyn is big but small at the same time.   Okay so here we are 4 months later and I have yet to tell Jas that those two are seeing each other none the less having sex on a regular basis.  The BBQ is July 24, what should I do?

           These pass couple of months I have been on the edge about getting into nursing school, but finally I got the acceptance letter and Friday I took a 2 hour trip to the Bronx (a different world) to handle my business. I went to the College paid my enrollment fee, handed in my health forms,went to Financial Aide, spoke to an Academic Advisor and registered for classes. Already having a BA from a state school I knew what to expect when I got there and had my scissors to cut any red tape. College Administration is usually full of "red tape" and I felt so bad for the freshmen that were there for orientation. No only are they forced to participate in these pre-college seminars but they are told "hey we need this paper, that paper, and proof of this." Me being a vet to this game I came prepared. After handling my bees-wax I was able to enjoy my weekend.       This weekend was great, I got my hair done and seen my man on Friday. I spent my Saturday running around Manhattan looking for some type of Superhero shirt for my b/f and settled on a Punisher shirt. Then I ventured to Kings Plaza to get another shirt for him. God I'm such a good girlfriend, but at times I can be a real b*tch. Sunday was even good. I visited family and then capped my day off with a good ole game of Double Dutch. Yes, I said Double Dutch. A couple of us (all over 21) decided it would be fun and even got the guys involved. It was a sight to see. A bunch of grown-ass people playing DD late at night like we didn't have to go to work in the morning.
