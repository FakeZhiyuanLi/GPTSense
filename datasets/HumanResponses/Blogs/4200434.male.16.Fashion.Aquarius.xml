      Ok I don't understand why people like this movie so much.  It's about a poor dude who meets this stuck up bitch on a boat and he winds up smashin her.  For some strange reason, she dumps her future million dollar husband to try and get with some poor guy who plays violin and draws pictures of naked chicks.  In the end, he just dies.  Now she is stuck with nothing but a shitty old necklace which she winds up tossing in the ocean after about 60 years lata.  I find this movie to be quite gay and the picture is a good way to describe my thoughts on it, and the boat itself. .  .  .  .  .  urlLink      urlLink   urlLink   urlLink

       Hand of fate is moving and finger points to you  He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do  Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say  The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way  You watch the world exploding every single night   Dancing in the sun a new born in the light  Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death  Hello to eternity and live for every breath  Your time will come Your time will come  The ferryman wants his money you ain't going to give it back  He can push his own boat as you set up off the track  Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same  Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame  You watch the world exploding every night  Dancing in the sun a new born in the light  Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain  The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again  Your time will come Your time will come   ~Iron Maiden Wicker man~
