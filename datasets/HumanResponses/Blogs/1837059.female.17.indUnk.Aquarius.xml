      "Is that a tornado's badge?" Ron demanded suddenly, pointing to the front of Cho's robes, where a sky-blue badge emblazoned with a double "T" was pinned. "You don't support them do you?"  "Yeah, I do," said Cho.  "Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning the league?" said Ron, in what Harry considered an unecessarily accusatory tone of voice.  "I've supported them since I was six." said Cho coolly. "Anyway...see you, Harry."  Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix  Well ... I went to the PNE yesterday. I actually didn't make the plans , Auntie Rosemarie, Ape's mom made them instead. So during Thursday I took the ferrie with Angela, April , Uncle Rey and Auntie Rosemarie a very early one like 8:00 or something. I actually woke up early, so that crosses one thing off my list! We went to Ikea and Hon's. After Apesters and I went wedding dress shopping on E. Hastings, we found it boring but Auntie found a cool one that I liked , I thought she should've bought that one.   Ape's went on a date with her boyfriend who is so polite and nice, she's so lucky. And she's probably the only person who reads this website.  The next day , I went to the PNE with some YFCers from Victoria and Vancity. The coaster is the BEST!!! I loved Hell's Gate too!!! My whole left side got soaked, it looked as if I peed my pants and it only went down one leg :P. I hung out with the YFCers but later I hung out with Ape's and her boyfriend while the rest uhh..rested!! They were cool to hang out with even though they were cuddling, I didn't feel so uncomfortable. It's different to see your best friend with a significant other...   I went home on the ferrie and Angela was bored so we both had an idea that I could teach her like a teacher to prepare her for school. I named the school "St. Tevie(that's not my real name)." I taught her things I learned in Grade 9 and 10, like the when the Confederation of Canada was formed(1867), photosynthesis, cellular respiration, the human body, the solar system, stuff about the ocean. She didn't understand a lot of it, but I didn't expect her to. So instead I taught her multiplication and she caught on really quickly which was quite incredible because she's only 7 and going into Grade. 1, which is the grade you learn multiplication. But there's nothing like being ahead of the everyone else!!!   I'm in a positive mood right now. I've never understood why people use the term "not unlike" What does it mean? Does it mean  like-ing   something ? I don't' get it. If you were to say something is not like the other thing you'd say"NOT LIKE" RIGHT? Not "not unlike".  Or is it just a pessimist view of saying "like?" Nope, me no understand, arhf, it make me frustrated!!!!! I just asked my parents and they messed me up more!!! The complexity of English, sheeza, no wonder why foreigners find our language hard!!!   The ironic point about the fires in Kelowna is it burnt down the Upper class area...hmmm...it's like a message.   Telvie

      I tried 6 different sorting hat quizzes, my results were; 1.Ravenclaw 2.Hufflepuff 3.Ravenclaw 4.Ravenclaw 5.Gryffindor 6.Gryffindor  Ravenclaw is the majority, but I think I suit Gryffindor more.  TJ

      So finally the fires in Kelowna are moving away from the central city!!!! That's awesome, but like 200 houses are burnt down, so that a total bummer, it's amazing that it's so close to my home and so surreal...I've been thinking about that Guy and how I said I was over him but I'm not...I don't think I ever will be...This may sound stupid but for that brief moment in the hall in _______ how he called me smart and smiled... he really meant it...I dunno this is stupid and makes no sense.  Things I  MUST  do before school starts: 1. start going to sleep early!!!!! I can't wake up @ 11:00 a.m anymore 2. clean my room and organize my shitty school stuff 3. get my goddamn L 4. finish  Catcher in the Rye , (Holden's language has started to make me curse, and I saw  The Good Girl  last night and it made me sad) 5. finish other books I've started this week 6. prepare my plans for the PNE and what the hell I'm planning to do; stay the night there or go home, I haven't made up my mind  and all  ARGFFFFFFFF. 7.(this is during school) become motivated and punctual this year in school  O.K....!?!!?!?!!?!!

           Hmmm....well, summer is almost over and it sucks. It was a good summer, probably the best I've ever had. I went to England and Wales and that was good and I wish I could've stayed longer but whatever. I guess I'm going to Vancouver, I only hope I am unless all my plans screw up or I screw up or I change my mind because I always have a tendency to do so.            I really have to learn how to post pics and change the backround of this thing because it looks super boring, I'll ask my sis. But no, she's leaving so soon! It hasn't hit me yet, like when I was on the plane to London, it didn't when I was in London walking by Big Ben or even by Stonehedge. I guess things don't seem like a reality unless you've discovered what you've lost and time passes. See, I'm not the kind of person who basks in a moment I have to tell people a trillion times "I've been there" or "I've seen that." Then it sinks in and I get depressed and when I do go back to that place, because nothing has changed and I adjust more to the surroundings and it doesn't appear to be as cool as it was the first time.                                                                                                                                                                                               Whatever , I'm just rambling on and on until someone in this house(preferably my sis) comes home. When she's gone, the environment of my house will be so different, I'll have to learn to live without her and not tell her all this stuff about my crush who I don't like anymore, because our  non-existant conversations were so...indifferent. If you basically have your storage area at school across from one another   all year  and never talk to each other,  except about the idea of summer school that I never attended, a converstion that lasted for mere seconds,I was excited, now it looks so pathetic.  I never saw him all summer and I'm so happy that I'm over him.       School is in a week. It isn't that hard, but Grade 11 actually counts, damnit, that means I can't procrastinate and lounge around all the time. I actually have to study and do my work, that will be difficult. I watched Princess Mononoke yesterday and it was amazingly good, I usually don't like anime but Hiyao Miyazaki's movie are so beautiful and well told. He also directed Totoro and Spirited Away and those movies are probably my favourite movies.He's also doing "Howl's Moving Castle" a novel by Diana Wynne Jones that I thought was decent but confusing, supposively he'll change the movie a bit from the book, whatever it's a Miyazaki movie!  I've typed enough, no one reads this anyways so like it matters. Those tree spirits are so cute, like the dust bunnie things in Totoro.  Tev

      This is a picture I drew before I saw Pirates of the Caribbean. Around a few days after I arrived home, from England.  I talked to JILLY!!!!! YAYA!!!!!! I miss u!!!!! Hey pee pee, I showed pee pee a poem yesterday, she liked it a lot, oh I love u pee! Thank you a million times, for everything! Jilly thinks I like_____.You know what I really don't know if I do or I if don't. I had a dream about him, a few nights ago, it kinda freaked me out because it felt like it meant something.  School is good, I'm doing really well in basically all my classes,except for Bio which is ALOT harder than I thought it would be. I know report cards are far away , I can't help but think they're around the corner. Cool it Tevs, they're not.I've only been in school for 3 weeks. Went to Sonny's cuz it was his birthday we celebrated it  avec  the Yfc crew yesterday. We reenacted a picture!!!! With Jilly, Carms, May, Me , Pee and Sonny, which was like 12 years ago!!! But since Jilly wasn't there, Poo filled in, it was sooooo sweet!!!!! Seeing how much we have all grown!  Well Today I did the definition of nothing , except talk to Jilly. I was so tired, I napped listening to Coldplay ,Radiohead, and Nirvana. Chris, Thom and Kurt all have nice..lullaby voices...hmmm......  have a good weekend everyone! I need to party again, bring out the drinks man! no haha, j/k.  tev.

      Well. Jill is leaving for England, for an entire year. She'll have jolly good fun!   Vince, my siblings and I went to dallas rd. cuz he got a brand new car, which was really cheap but in awesome condition. We watched the amazing storm come from the states over the ocean and almost got a pigeon in the car. They crapped all over the car, eww, but it rained,  ALLEUIAH! and there was thunder and lightning!!!! It was incredible.   My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me.So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst or break or bury or wear as jewelery,which ever you prefer.  - Hands Down, Dashboard Confessional  I love that song!  telle

I am not so satisfied with my classes. I think I'll drop Writing 12 cuz I'm the only 11th Grader...well it was nice to see some friends...some have gotten prettier...some look the same...mostly everyone hasn't changed...it's only 2 months.  Well I saw my old crush in a very stupid way...I was looking to see if my bus was there in the parking lot which was flooded by school buses...I was looking at one bus to see if it was mine...and at that freakin' moment he comes riding on his bike by that bus...and looking right at me too!(argh)... and of course I turned immediately...and I saw him in the reflection of a window...still looking at me. Hmph, oh well, What can you do? He looks the same...which is...gorgeous...I swear...he should model...  CJA

      Yesterday I stayed at school for so long. Cuz after school I had musical theatre and then I had to read at a poetry reading like an hour and a half later. So, during that time I watched the junior boys volleyball team, who are sooo amazing...and totally whooped the asses of the other team. There was one guy who was the volley setter on our school team, he was always serving or setting the ball. He was amazing....he only spiked when he had to and he set the ball perfectly. Above all that....I stared at him the whole game. I only know him as #3 though...I don't know his name....he was beautiful... but a year younger than I am...  The poetry reading was good. People liked my poem, said it was strong and unpredictable. One teacher said I got really emotional...The guy who was the reader that night was so funny, he had a cold . I liked his poetry. I wanted to buy his book, but I had no money.  TEVS

      I went to the Gob concert with April yesterday. It was good, I saw lots of ppl from my school...nice.  Apes didn't know who they were at the beginning and when they came out she was like, "I know who these guys are!!!" and the other gutarist was acting really goofy, and she was laughing and was like,  "I love that guy!"  After the concert I went to Starbucks and the bustop and the stupid buses weren't going to Hillside, so had I to have Daddy pick me up. I kinda felt bad though, but the schedule was messed up b/c it was a holiday! I ate yummy food and talked to my family and played with the little kids who were fooling around with a whoopy cushion, they are so funny.  Today I have no school, so I'm using this time to study.

Whoa, run on sentance. Well, Christmas, so soon, wow, a whole year...excess use of commas, sheez I just switch there don't I.

Enriched classes are much better than the normal one, because the people around you are actually keen on learning and strive to do really well. In normal classes they just goof off and usually don't do as well. But I dunno, I'm just generalizing....  Tevie

      You are a Dreamer! (Submissive Introverted Abstract Feeler) You are a DREAMER (SIAF)— reserved and imaginative. You are basically the shy, silent type. You don't have much interest in facts and figures or most of what's going on around you, but the internal worlds you build for yourself are rich and complex. Luckily, your creativity and strong heart mean you have a deep personality evident to anyone who gets to know you. It's just that not many people do. Talk to yourself less, other people more.   this is me(personality test)   i don't know, just what i'm here for, i want more than words can describe. i've been deprived, can you believe it? my whole world, it's been falling apart, falls and it falls and it falls all around me. but you're picking me back up..oh you're picking me back up, oh you're picking me back up. you make me high. -You make me high, Jason Mraz  this could be dedicated to a number of people for just being who they are  #1 person for being one of the most important and wonderful people this school year.

       I love myself better than you I know it's wrong so what should I do? On a plain, Nirvana  Don't worry the lyrics are directed to no one. I just like the song. Poor girl on fear factor had to get these flags, but it was really windy, she tried though, it took her 30 mintues, she was like 11 though. And that crazy guy on Jeopardy who won't loose, 20 days and a row and more than half a million dollars in his earnings. What a dorky braniac.  I've been reading alot, like 7 books at once, but I'm at the beginning at all of them except one, Abarat by Clive Barker. Which is like this fantasy world where there's 25 islands and each island has a different hours of day all the time. I'm in the middle of it. Also, I'm reading another book about time, where the sun moves really slowly across the sky, and areas are named after the days of the week and the months of the year. The book is called West of January by Dave Duncan. I'm reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen and Elizabeth(protagonist) does come up with pretty witty and funny things to say. But there life in the early 1800's was so boring, wahoo, let's go find some guys to court us and SEW! Mrs. Bennet is stupidly, ditzy funny. I like the plot line of Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, which I am also reading at the moment more interesting than the girls of Meryton, England. The little women girls are from Concord, Masachusetts(i don't know how to spell that) and they seem to do more things then the P&P girls. The two books do have a lot of silmalarities, both take place when there is a shortage of men, P&amp;P, Napolean War and L.W the American Civil War...and they consist of girls Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia from P&P and Meg,Jo, Beth, and Amy from L.W. Also the most mentioned protagonists in both the novels are the second daughters, who have in a way, quite a few things in common. They're both spirited, opinionative girls but Jo is short-tempered and Elizabeth has a quick, sharp tongue.  Ok, yeah I'm bored that's why I'm writing about books. Watched North Shore, it was lame and badly acted...it's no O.C. I don't even like The O.C much. I can tolerate it, but it's so predictable sometimes and ridiculous. I only watch it because I like Seth and Summer as a couple, and Sandy the dad is pretty funny. Whereas Marissa and Ryan are pretty boring together.But the quartet(Ryan, Marissa, Seth and Summer) are pretty funny when they're all together.  Marissa: I guess I'm the brains. Seth: No I'm the brains, Ryan's the braun. Sorry. Ryan: You can be the beauty. Summer: Then what am I? Seth: The boobs? Summer: Hey! Seth: The bitch? Summer: I'll take the boobs. [later] Marissa: I still think I should be the brains. Ryan: Sorry, Seth's the brains. Marissa: Well you're definitely not the beauty. Ryan: Now someone's the bitch.  hhaha, I like that part, that made me laugh. telvie.

      "I found a way to work with Tay, I'll work on an oil rig, while he protests on a Green Peace ship." -C.M. haha, funny   I GOT A B IN MATH!!!!! AND I SAW, FINALLY, HARRY POTTER! It was tres tres tres tres tres tres tres bien!!!  Damn, harry looks a lot better, he's no boy anymore... I mean the actor(dan radcliffe). I really loved the teenage angst the trio go through. And also the sexual tension between Ron and Hermoine was nicely potrayed...hahah. I liked it when they thought Buckbeak was beheaded and Hermione hugged Ron, then Harry hugged Hermione, I was like WHOA!!!  Y tu mama tambien  is the first thing that popped into my head, even though I haven't seen it, it's like this sexy movie or something with 2 guys who are best friends and a girl, haha, like Harry Potter! And had a History Mock today, I think I did fine.  Hitotsu Futatsu wa Akago mo Fumuga Mittsu Yottsu wa Oni mo Naku, Naku Tatara Onna wa Kogane no Nasake Tokete Nagarerya Yaiba ni Kawaru   Tatara Uta, Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) I don't what the lyrics mean, but it's a really pretty song. I felt like putting it up cuz my best friend says that I remind her of "GoGo" from Kill Bill Vol.1. I'm not Japanese and I don't walk around killing people with my huge metal ball and chain with spikes in a school girls uniform. I loved Kill Bill, hahah...    Elletjustiaquin

         Has anyone liked a person and wondered to themselves  if they really like the person? Or just do because they  have  to like someone at the moment? Think about it, like I like this person, and I've never talked to him..I  was talking to my friend and she was saying how you might think you like someone but you just might be making yourself like them...People think he's cute...like a lot of people had said so...like puppy, kitten or baby boy cute...but he is.     Well on another subject...my friend and I had plan to see a movie tonight...but he was kinda busy...I guess the scheuduling of the movie is not so right because of Provincials and stuff...Basically he wanted to study...but that was acceptable... BUT I REALLY WANT TO SEE HARRY POTTER!!!!  arghh!!! I *should* be studying...but...I don't want to..I was before...OH math I hate you. telle

        Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you       You are my only one I let go,    there's just no one that gets me like you do    You are my only, my only one    Made my mistakes, let you down    And I can't, I can't hold on for too long    Ran my whole life in the ground    And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone   Only One, Yellowcard   That song is kind of Emo and I like it. Emo is probably one of my favourite kind of rock, because they're mostly guys who are showing their feelings with song&nbsp;which I think is&nbsp;the sweetest thing...&nbsp;I'm a sucker for emotional guys, haha. &nbsp;    C.A&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

       I was in a shitty mood today. I don't know why, actually I do, for many reasons. Sometimes I really cannot stand myself or understand for that matter and it aggravates me. But I'm not embaressed to say that I saw Spiderman 2 today and the movie made me in a better mood...I feel good and a lot better than I was feeling just a few hours ago. Spiderman 2 had an emotional aspect to it that really touched me in a way, no matter how cheesy it may sound. The thing I liked about it, is that the villains are not actually evil but are basically manipulated by there inner demons to become what they are. And&nbsp;Peter Parker (Spiderman) how he was trying so hard to have a normal life and be with the&nbsp;person that he loves very much,&nbsp;but it was so hard for him to be normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I know dreams are supposed to mean something, and I've been dreaming a lot of someone over and over and over&nbsp;and it's always something of significant sentimental value...The only reasons why I'm typing on this thing is no one wants to hear me rant or tell them anything...And if you do(which you most likely do not) and are still reading this I congratulate you for having the tenacity to read the random thoughts that&nbsp;run through the mind of a 17 year old girl...&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ok, sometimes I wish I were a genius, like mathematically and philosophically(if that is a word). I'd be very happy... but doesn't intellectual advantages sometimes drive people into insanity?    Hmmm..like that guy from A Beautiful Mind.     Yeah, sure    C.A

         Oh...age is an odd thing. Sometimes I wish I were younger because life was so much easier back then. Acting immature is so much fun...maybe that's why I talk and act stupid&nbsp;a lot more when I'm by kids and preteens...I miss being young... Now everyone is now asking if I have a job and what&nbsp;I want to be or what&nbsp;secondary&nbsp;institution I would like&nbsp;to go to or&nbsp;if I have a boyfriend....Stop asking...I DON'T!&nbsp; I met someone this weekend who was really down to earth, smart, modest, funny, nice&nbsp;and cute...but young, quite a few years younger than me. And&nbsp;I kept thinking if only he were a bit older or if we were the same age, I'd probably really like him..       I finally know the meaning of teenage angst..it's just confusing..life is confusing...it's so bloody irritating. I'm in a kind of pissy mood at the moment and everything anyone does or says just pisses me off...Also to make things worse, I&nbsp;don't talk&nbsp;and when I do it's just something bitchy. Maybe I'm lonely...I haven't seen friends for a while and my sister and I've been home grounded against my will for a few weeks from the removal of my teeth...     &nbsp;   Sometimes I wonder if life would be easier if I were an insect or something...I mean, Can they think for themselves? Do they have extreme confusions and messed up brains and feelings and emotions like humans do? Or really all they have is a cerebellum and no cerebrum? All they have is animal instinct, right?&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I'm such a brat, I have an awesome life and yet I complain, act sarcastic and  cynical. I am complaining to this blog because no one wants to listen to me rave about being a confused teenager..I hope I'm better tomorrow..This sucks and usually I'm in a good positive mood (in a way I could be extremely sarcastic about that comment or very honest, that's how messed I am)&nbsp;&nbsp;         Life is so weird.     &nbsp;   This is totally unrelated, but that "Jesus Walks" music video by Kanye West, the one with the jail people not the one where he's in church, always gets me thinking...As much as the lyrics get stuck in my head. Everything about the video the jailers  (Sayin we eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast, Huh?Yall eat pieces of shit? Whats the basis?),  the innocent children playin jump rope, the&nbsp;drug dealers&nbsp;speeding away from a cop car and the lady singing in the back, and&nbsp;to the guy&nbsp;with the burning&nbsp;cross, carrying it up the hill. Everything about the video, the song, the tune, the lyrics, kind of haunts me...yet the song and the video is eerily beautiful and symbolic in a sense. It haunts me like that place I went to in the Philippines when I was really young&nbsp;where there were creepy statues of Jesus and Mary.      &nbsp;Jesus Walk- God show me the way because the devil tryna break me down          Jesus Walk With Me      Telle

          Ok...I do believe there is a god... But what I mean to say is that people take their belief in God to the extreme. I've spent hours thinking of things like this and I noticed that I've never had complete faith in my religion...because if you have complete faith in your religion you believe that everything that religion states, is the right one...Right? For as long as I can remember I've questioned everything...and the majority of these things is my religion. I question my religion…because I try to put the pieces together in my Catholic Church masses but nothing fits...it's just a jumble of words and meanings floating around... But people are ridiculously weird creatures, we fight each other for stupid reasons...discriminate each other… kill each other and yet I always wonder...Why are we here? Why are we the intelligent creatures? Why and who started the belief of there being a God? And why, WHY was the bible set in the Middle East? Why not anywhere else? And why do we Christians, Jews, and Muslims follow it? Think logically, if there is an almighty God in the beginning of time, why are there not books from other parts of the world that state the mightiness of God? The prospect of there being an Adam and Eve, the first human beings, just does not fit...I look at that as a metaphoric sense of humanity...To me it's a fable...like Aesop's tales or something…I look at the Bible not as fact because we all know that we don't know who it was written by...and of course they were stories told to people who passed to people...And we all know, if one person tells another person a story...they change it...Imagine that process occurring for a hundred years...or maybe a thousand. So what we are reading in the Bible is really an extremely abridged form of the original story that could be completely different as what really happened... I'm not saying that I'm right…or wrong I have no clue...It' just that everything about church, how some people believe that you have to attend to go to heaven...What God is to me is a symbol of good...but some people manipulate the true meaning of God to their own beliefs…Just everything in the world is so messed up...Just Dogma (church rules) killing people in the name of God? C'mon people...God would probably most not likely want you to kill in his name... is I don’t know...I should just take philosophy...nothing makes any sense anymore...Maybe I think too much that I might get an Aneurysm. I know not a lot of people read this and I know if you do…the majority of you may disagree with my opinions I don't know... And above all…is there a heaven or a hell? Or did we just make those up to  confirm  in our tiny little minds that there is something other than just dying? We are all extremely imaginative human beings...and all of us are complex...but the idea of God loving us so much...if he loves us so much...then he must love everything equally... I've had enough of this...I've probably contradicted myself a number of times.... the oh so confused...tevs

        I can't wait until this stupid swelling from my wisdom teeth goes down. So I could finally open my mouth and eat something and chew. And I also cannot go out because I look like a bloody chipmunk or something with very large cheeks. I can't smile either or laugh... I must be drugged all the time...so constantly my mind is very groggy and murky..and I feel tired.  Damn...this sucks some bad sh*t  telavive

        Hope dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption  Winding in and winding out  The shine of it has caught my eye   And roped me in  So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing  I am captivated   I am Vindicated  I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  I swear I knew it all along   And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself    Vindicated, Dashboard Confessional   That song is beautiful...  I feel so mixed up right now, conflicting emotions and thoughts all stir together to form a large blur of complete...nothingness...I don't know  teeth out soon...oh darn...no partying for 2 weeks..like I ever party anyways.   c.a

       I would just like to give a bit of praise to my friend Tiffany who is in Africa (Kampala Uganda) right now helping build a high school and talking to orphaned children. She is probably one of the sweetest and kindest friends I have and would like to pray for her safety and safe return. I would just like to say, where she is right now is not as prosperous nation and we here living in Canada are so fortunate we should be thankful every day we live here. And if any of you get an oppurtunity to help others in a less fortunate country, you should, to experience what we could never dream of, poverty and starvation... Remember we are so lucky to live here Let us pray for the ones less fortunate than us...     Reading:     The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood     True Believer by Virginia  Euwer Wolff     The Gammage Cup by Carol Kendall     Little Sister by Kara Dalkey     Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte     and many many more     i'm such a book worm... actually, i'm only in the beginning of these all          c.a
