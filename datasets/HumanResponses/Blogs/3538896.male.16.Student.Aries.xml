"i had not been regular wrtting in diary these days. tired i guess. (haha... Sara and LiLian (KC's cousin) jus kinda greeted me as a friendship way... haha... took my diary and read it... *hehe... i dun mind...*) yesterday went for the show about jesus and felt abit of biase... but no harm done trying. sorry jesus, dun mean to think like this... lots of things happened mentally today. i felt that my only source of friends which were from drama kinda changed... i feel, jus like i named Karen 'the broken bond', the source is now a 'broken' one too... Jannah from drama, Karen from drama too and now shirley (sec one shirley, not sec five) also from drama now became unfriendly to me... i wanted to forget them. it really hurts to see friends like that... everytime i see them, especially karen and shirley, my legs always started trembling and a sense of sourness will enter me and intrudes my heart... i went to drama bcuz i'm in search of friends. but i think, if i manage to let my dad trust me, (as in he hated christians) i would like to change my 4 years longed main source in drama to the family centre (which is where i learnt about jesus christ and watched the drama). every sunday starting 10am. unwillingly, i had lied to my dad that i'll go jogging from 10am to 12pm. haiz... furthermore, i've decided to work on changing 'speaking to my own' to 'speaking to jesus' for i felt he is the dream person i'm waiting for. perhaps, he might be waiting for me to get to him... at least, i had someone to talk to now..." thats all in my diary... 4:40pm now... haiz... wanted to go to yishun for buying some comics... but... i think it isnt possible now... haiz... geez... im getting lesser and lesser comments... maybe lesser ppl coming into my blog?? den i can predict that u guys (Kai Chin, Sandra, Shirley) are busy or is it that now not really interested in my blog le..?? hehe... but think KC is lazy to comment but for the rest, i not really sure... but really looking forward for some comments!! hehe... haiz...  Continuing to wad happened in school today, haiz... i somehow got "lectured" by KaiChin's cousin..!! of course fed up la... wad happened u'll ask right?? well... i was actually working on my chinese work book... the thing was that had done a little more than wad the teacher asked us to do... but i continued... haiz... nothing to do ma... den teacher asked me to start on doing "si zi" which was somehow like copying the words over and over again.. but... u know me, once i felt its of useless for me, i'll not do it... so i continued my chinese till the teacher "confiscated" my chinese work book and stopped me from doing more... haha... felt funny in this part... so jus listening to music and wait for time to pass than even starting on my chinese "si zi"... hehe... but LiLian somehow... erm... maybe she cared... told me in way of comparing that she rather do something than be there to ROT like wad i am doing at that time... wa... Fury ah..!! i couldnt control myself although i know it was for my own good... so jus shoot back some defences and changed my seat... haiz... took out my diary and done some self researching again... haiz... it was somehow partially my fault... wanted to apologise but din know how... haiz... why am i like that...!! haiz... these days really really could get irritated easily... but very lucky, she came apologising after chinese period when i changed back to where i should be... haha... i was still worrying on how to apologise to her...!! hehe... well... since its that way, i told her its okay... as i cant think of anything to say... haiz... thats wad all special which happened today... wa... doing this blog for almost 1/2 hour le... eyes not pain hands also tired... now 4:53pm... cosmix closing and i have to head on to my dnt course work... haiz... still confuse if i'm able to complete it... *SIGH*

"SaDnEsS iS ALL iN mE nOw... WaD ShOuLd i Do? TaKe iT eAsY AgAiN..?" hehe... (forcing a giggle) if i got the courage to start a friendship, why doesnt i have the courage to end it...? haiz... yup... hehe...  I want to cry... i jus feel like crying...

      Haiz... sorry for *so long din update blog*... haiz... from friday onwards to now, really alot alot of things happened... but i did not have any time for blogging... especially on saturday and sunday... i couldnt use blog at home computer for some unknown reasons that i couldnt log in... haiz... so now in cosmix blogging again lor... haiz...  Trying to recall on what had happened on Saturday, erm... hehe... nothing much either... hehe... jus went out for basketball and arcade as always... but i feel its really meaningfull coming out every week as it keeps us in contact... right KaiChin?? hehe... of course to Dilyse too... i suppose we 3 are always to be together always wherever we go... agree?? hehe...  Ahh... Sunday... a lot of things happened... I specially woke up at about 9am to prepare myself for the church i always looked forward for... hehe... but my parents din know about it... i told my dad i went jogging which turned out to be going for a walk as my dad wanted to bring me to sembawang park for *my jog*... hehe... haiz... when my dad got my dog for a walk, i somehow *sneak* out of the house... hehe... went to Lorraine's house as planned to change my clothes... Den headed for the church... When i got back home which is about 12pm, my dad wasnt home at all... i was still worrying about my clothes which i was lazy to change back and the *sweat* i was suppose to have after a jog... hehe... lucky me dad wasnt at home... i called him and learnt that he was at the *rock world* having a picnick... so just told him that i got myself ready as in i *change* my clothes and went down... hehe... *got out of trouble through the lie* After that, we went to Sun Plaza... i was so so happy... i dunnoe why i felt happy but i am jus... glad... maybe because of the church i went to which satisfied me... hehe... so happy that i even bought a clothe for my brother which cost up to $19.90... my dad said i must be having a fever to have said that... hehe... back to the car where my dad sent us home, he asked me again on the reasons i bought the clothe for my brother... i couldnt say i was... happy because... my dad would further think that i am crazy... so i made up a story and tell him the truth about the church after telling him not to be angry when i told him the truth... i told him that the church taught us kinship (which din teach at all) and i learnt how impt it is... which is another lie la... or i couldnt get out of the question... hehe... thats what special happened that day...  Bout monday and yesterday, school was as for normal... bored lor... and i was somehow rushing on my D and T folio which was supposed to hand in on this thursday which is the day after tommorrow... haiz... now, sitting beside me... a war going on... a *fight*... haiz... now the small guy waiting for his *opponent* to get out of school before they start to fight again as the fight jus now was somehow calmed down by Miss Yuliana... haiz... stupid...
