      with a million different ways to communicate, could it be that the message is just getting blurrier?  in this day and age, even getting someone's phone number is not a sure sign they would like to see you again.  with everyone having a cell phone, home phone, im name, email address (work and home), blog :), friendster profile, work phone number, [insert newest virtual communication device here]... you never know where someone's means of keeping you in touch fall on their totem pole of interest.  i pity all the sweet, but some how flawed men, who are excited to get my roomie's home phone, never realizing that the land line is his "never date" cemetery.  it is the romance equivalent of a never ending dial tone.  one of my friends only gives out her email address so she can judge a potential date 's grammar and spelling. only after being judged as suitably witty in a few messages will an actual phone number be produced.  people might be more reachable than ever, but we are still just as emotionally unavailable.   just how screwed up is all this murkiness and confusion in face to face communications?  fridays are a haze of running from my hellishly dull office job to the cozy, dim jazz club where i hostess on the uws.  it is a long day, but i can not complain about spending my friday nites hearing crazy gossip and discussing boys with the wonderful waitresses that i love, and pretending to be in some dark cave of a jazz club on some hidden parisian side street.  i would be sending mixed signals if i didn't admit that a large bulk of our time is spent debating the levels of cuteness of the various band members that play every night.  i immediately thought one bass player, in particular, was extra cute.  i feel like i should be using jazz lingo here, but all i can think of is chicky baby from peewee's play house and he definitely is not a chicky baby.   and he definitely is not clear, either.  the past three weeks have been spent scratching my beatnik beret wondering, did he ask me out, or are we just having a conversation?  i thought it was in my head, but i took special note last week. we start to talk. he will suggest an outing. i say yeah! that would be fun! he slowly backs away and the conversation kind of just trails off...   it would be like someone losing a cell signal, only what is it when that happens during a face to face conversation?  i feel like i need that little guy that goes around saying "can you hear me now? now? wait, ...where are you going?"  and then we do it all again the next week.  the reactionary side of me thinks, maybe we, as a society, have gotten so used to quick emails, long cell phone gabs and meaningless bar talk that we are crippled when it comes to actually arranging anything in person.    but then again, this weekly ritual is comforting.  there is something nice about winding along, with no goal in sight, just taking whatever comes up.  it is nice to become friends with someone with out all the static and distractions of dating and manditory phone calls.  ok, what i am really thinking is what the hell? ask me for my number already!    will tonight be like the past few fridays?   hmmm, well, leave your messaged and i'll have to get back to you...(to be continued...)

      well, consider that last post just a commercial break... ***************************************************************************************** when i am single single* i notice two major changes in my life:  1. i have loads of time.  i am not sure what i am doing with this time when i am paired up, plucking petals off daisys?  writing our names in different fonts in my notebook? making mix tapes?  but i have never found evidence (dead daisy centers, filled notebooks, i am not even sure my cd player has a tape deck...) that i do these things, but then where does all that extra time go?**  2.  i become obsessed with making things.  i am sure the entire martha stewart empire was built by girls like me going through a single stage.    i am happy to be this way, though. i think most girls fall into 2 categories. the first are what i call rosies (as in the riveter.) they take pride in being productive, using their free time to build things, explore the city, to start small revolutions, stuff like that.  but, we are inevitably friends with at least one girl who falls in the other group...the walls (as in wailing.) guys fall into these categories too, but there is an extra play station obsessed group that they can fall into, too.    maybe it is because i just finished "truth and beauty," a memoir by ann pacthett where every seventh sentence was, "and lucy would say, "i'll never have someone. i'll never, ever have a boyfriend."  lucy's plight was much more dramatic than 99% of the rest of us, but we all at one point have had the duty of reassuring a friend that "yes you are datable, yes someone is out there, and yes your nipples are symmetric."  it just goes along with being a friend.    i think, though, when it is me having the doubts, they matter a lot less when i am actually constructing something.  ok, so what if there is not someone out there for me, at least i know my way around a glue gun and can make a sequin on velvet elvis.    that is why this week i am making soup.  that and i have run out of velvet and frames. (a girl never should run out of sequins...i learned that from numerous nights at pieces (thank you jason!)!)   being the scrappy astorian bohemian that i am, most nights my dinner consists of soup and a sandwich (not from the posh cosi or au bon pain, either, no, no, but from the wonderful la trade fair deli counter...a grocery market so compact and chaotic, they ask you to hold merchandise to use you for display space...)  at $1.59 a can for progresso, it is a cheap dinner.  but for a girl with time on her hands and in need of a diversion, it is not cheap enough! plus, there is something very french and retro about making your own soup.   plus, hey, at the least, it gives you something to spoon!  here is my favorite recipe for "split-up pea soup"...  1 bag split peas 6 cups water 1 small onion 1 large carrot 1 clove garlic 3 chicken bullion cubes  put it all in a big pot, bring to boil and then lower to simmer. leave it on until the peas are your desired tenderness... pop in a mix tape and rest assured that, yes, they do look even in your apron :) ***************************************************************************************** *single single= truly, truly single.  meaning not even seeing someone "special." or even someone "not so special."  also causes a repeating of words in a dramatic fashion, as in not just "being single, but being  single  single."  ** and no, that only takes about 15 minutes...i'm not dating sting here...***  ***isn't it weird that out of the millions and millions and millions of people in the world there is only ONE guy that is an example of, well, how do i put this with out resorting to bunny ears and a drum...you know what i mean.  he really is the only poster boy for it.  just him.****  ****the star use is really getting out of hand, isn't it?

      for 12 long years the folks in singapore have had to either chew imaginary gum, or risk getting smacked! all that is over now!  licensed users can now chomp in peace. in honor of this burst of flavor, lets take a look at possibly the most stylish gum around...orbit. what isn't to love about orbit?  the ads are impossibly stylish, and i love the way the spokes girl dresses! plus, what other gum comes with a carrying case???*   orbit is a very mod gum. i would have to say that no fashionable purse is complete without it.  (and the pink one is the best...)  keep poppng!  *well, besides bubble tape. which i love. but their ads were kind of annoying.

      is one ever ready to cut the ties that bind?  especially when they involve love and sculpting gel?  i never have been the cheating kind.  even the idea of betraying someone's trust in me freaks me out more than it tantalizes.  i do not understand people who like to cheat.  but, then again, in all honesty, i have never put my self in the position to even have to consider going through with something compromising.   until now.  now i have a little scrap of paper, burning a hole on the top of my desk, holding discrete digits and a little cheerful note.  and now the burden is all over me, like a set of hot rollers on a beehive, do i make the call that will ultimately end a 11 year relationship. or do i throw it away and pretend i was never seduced at all?  you see, i have been seeing veronica, my hair dresser for over a decade.  she sculpted my hair for the prom, saw me through my punky choppy cut days, and even introduced me to my hair iron (for that i owe her the world...). jesus, this woman gave me red highlights!  could i give up all our history on a new fling that i might end up hating anyway?  but now, i might have met someone else...the bartender at carne has the most picture perfect, made for mod hair i have ever seen. her hair could star in a music video.  i have never felt this before, but i was actually lusting after hair.  i wanted it for my own head! so i made the first move.  (no, not pulling her hair out of her head, that would be crazy!) i talked to her.  and then it got even more seedy. she gave me her hair dresser's number...and he cuts hair out of his studio apartment in soho...it is like a speak-easy salon. and i had the password to get in.  was this all excitingly illicit, or just plain hair whoring?.  then reality set in...how could i explain this to veronica?  i wanted a new, flashier cutter?  after all she did for me?  i knew i had neither the pocket book, nor the free saturdays to see both of them at once.  plus, surely i would run out of hair that way.  no, i must end it with veronica...maybe after just one more goodbye trim...

      beneath the ashes of a burnt bra, does the underwire still remain?  there comes a time in every girls life when she must question how liberated she really is...and it usually occurs after wine, dinner and dessert, when a little black plastic envelope is discreetly slid on to the table. and awkwardly stays there.   on some dates, it is a no brainer, there is a swift and unspoken click to dutch.   other times it just sits there, like an extra egg roll no one ordered. as an independent, free thinking girl, why do i still even pay attention to who pays for what?   it is more insulting for a boy to bulldoze the subject and declare "i'm paying. NO. i am paying."  and leave it at that, isn't it???    but sometimes i become inwardly insulted when a guy accepts me paying half. "was i not an exciting enough date? does he still want to make out with me? is he one of those metrosexuals who wants to split bills, not open doors, use my hair products, and still harbor extremely misogynistic streaks? damn, i could have had the onion rings after all... was it my skirt?  does he pay for other girls?" and from that point on the date is basically blown and i am secretly a neurotic mess. and i feel an incredible urge to order chocolate...  i think my issues with who pays for the date, stem less from a need to be provided for, and more for the fact that i feel it is a not so subtle way to see how much my date likes me.  i don't expect anyone to take care of me, ever; i don't think i all of sudden become needy when it comes to a $12 dinner.  this weekend i ordered up a steaming plate of this situation.  i agreed to go on a date with this guy i was not super in to. he planned everything, the place, the day, the time. he  asked  me to go. i said yes.  when the check came, he threw down $20 for his part of the meal.  i was a bit perplexed. i always thought if you invited someone somewhere you at least offer! girl or boy! it is etiquette! i paid for the rest of it, we walked outside and i jumped in to the subway.  needless to say, i promptly popped right out of the subway and met my friend at a bar.  she bought me a drink.

      in an effort to keep my roommate, jason, from being found like those lonely academics who are gone for months, smushed to death under huge volumes of ancient texts and those really big map books, only to be found when a neighbor thinks something has gone stinky, i have decided to divert some of my dumb ramblings from emails to him into a blog for no one. only i think it would be really hard to be smushed under the millions of emails i send him because they are not bound, they are merely pixels. and a pixel never even gave anyone a paper cut. but still, it is better to be safe than sorry!    so out of the depths of office work boredom, comes its a mod mod mod mod world! concerned with only the most modern of matters. and all delicious diversions.

       the taxi rate hikes have forced me to make the most of my cab ride money home, but this seems ridiculous...   there comes a point in everyone's life when they must ask themselves, how low am i willing to go? or, more specifically, am i willing to go on a blind date with a russian set up by a cab driver?   with match.com, craigslist, personals and friendster, is totally blind dating a thing of the past?  it all boils down to hope.  unless you have developed a strong crush on the wonderful guy from your community volunteer organization, or have been in love with the same person since you were 6 (and have character witnesses for those 1-5 years...), there is some unnamed force that compels you to imagine the person you are primping for, the person you are willing to see stupid date friendly movies with, the person at the bar you just gave your number to, is worth it all.  common sense, best friends, and pure statistics will tell you, no they aren't.  all dating is like blind dating, or at least just-poked-in-the-eye dating, where you see only certain glimpses, good or bad, of the other person. but yet, there is always that slight chance that this is the person who is made just for you, this person you just met is a keeper.  the trick is preventing bad dates from leaving you hopeless.  armed with my unfailing faith and lack of common sense, and ready to make my cab driver earn his extra cents a quarter mile, i pushed my head through the pexiglass divider. i was too tipsy to realize those things must have been installed to thwart over zealous single girls in the city from harassing the drivers...but if someone is drunk enough and has a small enough head, some piece of plastic is really no match for them.   ironically, i jumped in the cab to get some guy to leave me alone (“i'm an astoria girl, you are a brooklyn boy, this would never work...”)  after a few blocks, however, i was feeling regret at being so curt. what if he was my true love? what if stupid date movies would have been fun with him? what if he would have paid the cab fare home??? and now i was alone.  or was i? the best way to meet guys was through other guys, isn’t it?  i mean, if there is a wonderful guy that your girl friend wants you to meet, wouldn’t she have liked him? isn’t that the common curse of the blind date?  and here i had this wonderful resource, with an amazing grasp of traffic laws, less than 3 feet away from me.   by the time we were over the upper road way, my cab driver had decided v. was perfect for me.  not only had i been in love with a guy named v. freshman year of college, but this v. was single.  these seemed to be the only two criteria at 3 am for a match made in heaven, ok, in a cab.  so it was decided that along with a tip, I would give my phone number to sasha, the driver, and v. would call me.  i was able to go to bed with a sliver of hope that night.    i wasn’t the first girl to have a sliver of hope turn into a blister of regret and a hangover. v. actually did call. and he did fancy a date. and now i would have to evaluate if i was pathet-- hopeful enough to agree to this blind date. was my romantic side selfish enough to put my rational side through what could be an awkward and boring date?  on one hand he could be very nice and cute, and i have always had a thing for people from revolutionary pasts (ok, just russians, maybe the french...). on the other he could be a psycho-killer, or worse, not cute!  but for some strange reason, i have faith in my cabby.  and being a retro girl, maybe this true form of blind dating, without the gimmicks of photos and testimonials, is where true love could be found.  and if it was awfully horrible, i could always take a taxi home.  maybe the subway would actually be a better idea...
