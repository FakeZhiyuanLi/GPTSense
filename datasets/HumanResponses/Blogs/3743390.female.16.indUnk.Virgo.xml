      Vindicated ~ Dashboard Confessional   Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine ahead has caught my eye And roped me in so mesmerizing It's so hypnotizing I am captivated I am   Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intention Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so Isolated so Motivated I am Certain now that I am  Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself  So tired of the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment for forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim Against the current  So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip against the current So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away  Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself  My hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption   There is absolutely nothing like a good Dashboard Confessional song.  *melts*  I love them...  They make me happy.  Making me happy is a chore...  I've found 3 things that can do it.  Mike, music, and gay people.  These things brighten my life.

      I swear for Jesus...  I need to be on some kind of medication for my moodiness.  This shit is uncalled for.  I want to just shove barbed wire up everyones ass right now.  It's really starting to piss me off that I'm getting pissed off about stupid shit.  Someone needs to shoot me or something.  I'm 2 seconds away from dugging up on Benedryl Allergy so I'll sleep the next 18 hours...  Peacefully.  Even if someone woke me up and was talking to me, I wouldn't have the slightest idea what I nor they were talking about.  *sighs*   Rant rant rant... Bitch bitch bitch.  Complain.

      Okay, so...  I got my period.  I'm sure you all care to read this...  BUT YAY!  I hope this means I'm not pregnant.  I'm still going to take a test when I finish.  Some people have their periods while pregnant.  *Jumps for joy*  You have no idea how great this makes me feel.

      Why am I pissed off now...  I went to bed at 1:30 last night...  Only to wake up at 9:30 with enough energy to run a fucking marathon.  All I wanted to do was to sleep in.  Thats what I do everyday and I like it like that.  But NO!  My body has to get energy when I really don't want it.  Fuck you sleeping pattern.  Fuck you...

      He told me he loved me tonight.  *Dies*  I'm so completely content.  Overwhelmed even.  We had a great night.  We went over to Jen's and hung out for a while.  Then we went to the park and made out in the back seat of the car.  It was thundering and lightening.  It was just awesome.  I loved it.  Then we were sitting in my drive way and talking and joking around...  And I was playing and I said "Why don't you just admit you love me..." and he looked at me and leaned in to kiss me and said "I love you, baby"  *smiles* I didn't say anything at first and I was ask him if this was his biggest fear and he shrugged then I looked at him and told him I loved him too.  I'm so incredibly happy.  =)

      I hate pictures.  My senior pictures are absolutely horrible.  It's all their damn fault too.  They should have sent the cards out about 2 weeks before they were coming to my school.  Instead they waited til the Saturday before the Monday that I was supposed to have them done.  I DONT HAVE MY FUCKIN LICENSES!  I can't just drive there.  So I didn't get to go, but instead had to travel 2 hours out of the way to get shitty ass pictures.  I'm steamed right now.  FUCK!  Not to mention that mother doesn't want to take me back to retake them.  These packages are $260 at the cheapest and I dont want to waste my fucking money on some stupid ass pictures.  The only nice thing about them was my eyes.  Woopty-fucking-do.  Prestige, you can kiss my fat ass.

      I suppose I should tell you about myself.  My name is Rebecca and I'm 16, almost 17, years old.  Although, in my personal opinion, I've been through much more than most 16 year olds.  I'm an ex-felon, which I'll take the time to explain later.  I've been kicked out of my house.  I've been to hell and back basically.   Right now, life is good for me.  I've met someone who makes me completely happy.  Michael.  I honestly cannot remember a time when I've been this content with my surroundings...  Even when they're a complete load of shit, he's still there for me.  Although I'm not exactly happy about the fact that its possible, I could be having his child in 9 months.  Fun for me right?  Well I'm assuming if I am pregnant, it's a damn miricle.  Mike believed he was impotent, which I can see why he would think that.  He was in karate and took many kicks to the nuts.  He also was engaged to his ex for a good two or three years.  He slept with her for three years, unprotected, and never got her pregnant.  She cheated on him, and well she now has a baby.  That is kind of odd, if you ask me.  If you're wondering, Mike is 20...   Lets see...  My felonies.  I'm not sure I feel like going into all that right now.  I'm just trying this blog thing out.  Perhaps I'll indulge you a little more later.
