      I had a lot of fun today pretending to be Mr. uber hacker. Basically, apage's brother was pissing him off, by asking Apage for money to buy yu-gi-oh cards. The night started out with Apage disabling his brothers internet and redirecting him to "There has been a major internet failure". Then, after a bit of inspiration, I asked to help scare the tyke. Apage gave me root access on the computer his brother was on (I already had root access on ap's computer to hop from). After getting in, and a bit of trouble getting the required utilities (xmessage mainly) to work, I started sending him messages. The first was "Your computer is being hacked by Feuer, it will explode in 8 minutes". The next was "I took down the internet, I invented MS BLASTER, I'll take down you". He played right into my hands after that, after which I said "I warned you" and promptly shut him down. Right at the moment, Apage and I are concocting a fake CNN story about a hacker named Feuer. My fake hacker alias (as if an alias could be any more fake) was taking from a Megaherz song called Spiel Nicht. More specifically from the line "Spiel nicht mit de feuer" or "Don't play with fire". It was pretty awesome.    Feuer frei! - Zaph.

      First things first. I don't like myself. Never have, never will. I don't hate myself to the point of wanting to harm myself...at the moment. But I hate myself to the point that a lifestyle change would be good, but that I think I couldn't accomplish one.  Next up, love. I've never been good at it. There is one girl I truly do love, at the moment, more than maybe life itself, but she does not love me, and in fact loves some guy named Rick. But that, my friends, is an entirely different story.   Speaking of friends, there are many I would consider friends. Topping the list is a real life dude, Josh. A little strange, but still one of the nicest, most awesome people I have had the chance to meet. Right below him is a guy from an entirely different universe, Apage. I wish I knew more about him, but I know enough to know that hes one of the nerdiest guys I know, and thats ALWAYS a plus for me. Below him are a bunch of people who are friends with Josh, and my unofficial UT club at school. Below that, are the other people I know on IRC, including Fungahhh, ShloobeR, Exophase, echeese, gofer-chan, and the rest. Below that is really nothing. Except for my enemies such as 75% of the ZZT community, especially Nadir and Mooseka. And one particular MZX jerk, mOdac. But he's been less of a jerk lately... mainly by not talking.  Enough about me. Tell me about you! Comment!
