       "Oops, I did it again". -Britany Spears-  I should probably be quoting someone more academic (Henry James perhaps?), since I'm completing my Masters and all, but I think that dear Britany captures the idiocy of the moment to perfection. Damn, perpetual piss-pooper cost me another $90. I know, I know, should've got a friendly feline. Can't a dog also be trained to use a litter box? Definitely not our dog - Stefan says that she wins the retarded-est dog of the decade award. Just because she tries to lick and chase her own shadow, don't mean she's dumb. Would having her bladder extracted and replace with a super size one be unethical?  Right, so: I went to take her for a walk tripped over the little psycho's leash the door closed as I fell the key chain was caught between the frame and the door, with the keys 'Ã  l'interieur' of course.  The locksmith, on seeing the keychain in the door, instantly took pitty on me and charged me less. Thanks Jared, if you ever stumble upon this blog.  La Fin

      After a delicious break from teaching, I'm back to humwies, wegies and wodka. At the school, which took a chance and hired me, Japanese and Chinese post-teens make up oh, about 99.9% of the students. However, the call I got 2 weeks ago, pulling me out of my sabbatical, launching me back into the ESL ring, was to teach a "pain-in-the-ass student from Muenster" a direct quote from the school's director of studies. I'm always up for a little paid damage control, so I asked her how much per hour, and whether a straight jacket was required or not. Following a short game of verbal ping-pong, we ended up negotiating a fine deal.  No worries, I TKHOed (totally knocked her out) on my 1st day back. Poor girl was sitting rigidly when I got into the classroom, in a rigor mortis like state, exuding angst, and then tada, I showed up. The first words to escape her lips " are you old enough to be teaching" a little 'frech' isn't she?  A firm believer in corporal punishment, I fixed her good and quick, using my favorite form of torture...The present perfect. All is well that ends well, we spent 3 hours a day together for 2 weeks and she almost grew on me like a persistent fungus. Can you say over-achiever, she definitely needs to chill out. I think the only way she'll pass her final University exam, she studies English, is by downing a full bottle of Ukrainian red sparkling wine!  She flew back to Germany early, to start studying (for those who aren't aware, uni there starts in October!), and I am back to sleeping in until mid-morning and spending the rest of my time at the beach, except when class interferes, only 8 hours a week - thank the heavens. In Greek mythology, is there a god or goddess of procrastination?

         That's right, if you haven't already heard, we've gone stark mad, overcome with raving lunacy (a medical condition you know) - we acquired a dog. final stop. Take a breath and read on. Yes, we have been walking and feeding her, and this is where the once upon a time comes in.  Once upon a time, on a trendy 1950s-style street in Sydney's Eastern suburbs, we took our puppy for her much needed daily-blasphemous-walk across the road to the church, which as embarrassing as it is, has been re-baptized, by our dog, as a P.W.C. (puppy water closet).However, no need to feel disgusted, we do pick up after her - and might I just say "YUCK!" and once again re-iterate "YUCK!" (side bar: Suz I totally understand your diaper aversion now)  On this evening around midnight, we put the ol' girl on her leash, and set out to save our carpet from being soiled, once again- forgetting our keys of course. On our return, Stefan was going to attempt to scale the 3 stories, on the drainage pipes, to our open living room window, but a little voice let him softly know that he WOULD HAVE TO BE OUT OF HIS FREAKIN' MIND TO DO SO!  A neighbor on the 1st floor, in response to the soft voice outside her window, invited us in, and in pure Aussie fashion, offered us some alcohol and proceeded to call the 24 hour locksmith( a number she knew off-hand???) and fix the entire situation, which cost us a merely 160AUD.  The moral of this story: God will punish those who let their pets soil the lawns of the Lord.
