      I think Margaret Cho is so smart. I'm not gay, just to clarify. The stuff she says in her blogs is so relevant to me and I agree with it so much it's unbelievable. I have been trying to be more courageous and she is a model for me.  Anyway, her blog address is http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/blog.htm.

      Kolya is such a strange person. He won't see anybody most days, including me. He might be there, he might be off somewhere in another part of the world. Or just in New Orleans. I've found the ticket stubs, he can't fool me. He goes there to eat, comes home 20 pounds heavier and won't come out of his room. How can I be the publicist to a person who is invisible?

       I have been really busy and I haven't put up my cartoons yet. But I'm still writing them, so that's a good thing.    &nbsp;  They have taken on a nasty edge, so that's something. I find that the meaner the cartoon, the funnier. However, never being mean to the good people.    &nbsp;  Remember: Trouble never takes a holiday.    &nbsp;

      I have been working on the cartoons (I say cartoons because they are not all funny, so cannot be called comics). A dog may work from sun to sun, but a kitten's work is never done.  I am also thinking about selling things I make on this blog. I hope that is not against the rules. You should be able to sell things that you make yourself, man. We'll see.  Kitten

       There is another Kitten Heels! I was on someone elses blog and clicked on my own kitten heels and it went to her site. One of the first posts went something like this: "Well, today has been basically a boring day...". Oh, man. That's not me, ok?

      I have looked at 2 other blogs that are very cool. The first is Living in Egypt. It is amazing! I wish I had time to look at it more. It's by a Canadian widow of an Egyptian who lives in the rural outskirts of Cairo. If you are fascinated by Egypt as I am  and have gotten no closer than the British Museum and our own Carlos Museum here in Atlanta, you will be amazed. It is called Living in Egypt and is currently a featured blog. She goes by miloflamingo and since she is featured, I don't think she would mind my mentioning her site here in my blog.  The other is the blog of a Czech person and it looks like he is doing something very interesting over there, but I don't get the full jist of it yet. He writes some of it in English, so I have clues. I have looking at the translations and I think Czech looks something like Russian but written in the Roman alphabet. I am very interested in languages and most everything in Europe, so I am "Czeching out his links". Sorry, I hate puns. But you British lot will love it I guess. Sods.

      I have scanned and colored all of my cartoons and put phrases to them and I tried to post them and can't. I am upset. They're very good and I want everyone to see them. Perhaps it's karma so that I winnow out the nasty ones, I don't know.
