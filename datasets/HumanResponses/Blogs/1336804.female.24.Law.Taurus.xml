      - Two cans of Schaefer  - 3 Cups of Miller Light - 2 Citron and Tonics - 1 Shot Tequila - 1 Shot Red-headed Slut - Acts of Public Indecency - Getting 6 hours of sleep.  &nbsp; And that's really all there is to say about anything. Am I wrong?

      but you can't make it tell you how good the water tastes.   Had an "interesting" conversation with my long-distance love interest last night. I'm the sort of girl, who when I'm three thousand miles away from someone I'm enamoured with, needs a few kind words tossed her way. I know he likes me. I know he cares about me. It's not like he hasn't given anything up. It's just that I get so frustrated and resort to spewing "I miss you's" and he in turn starts cracking jokes about armadillos, bananas, and everyone's favorite subject, my mother. It makes me angry. All I want to hear is some sweet nothings. He won't give those up though. I finally got so frustrated I just got off the phone with him. It  still  escaped him that I was pissed off. Or at least he acted like it escaped him, which is even more infuriating.   His defense was that he doesn't want me "telling him what to do." OOOOOook. Wait. No, really. OK. I totally understand the concept of not wanting to be told what to do. I'm no good at it, to be quite honest. Go to class (no). Don't have sex (nope). Clean your room (no). And countless other things. The difference is that when you're involved with someone, you make sacrifices. You do things that would make them smile, simply because you like the idea of making them smile. It becomes a selfless act, this giving in to another person's desire. I'm sure if I'd told him the only thing that would make me feel better is a threesome with a D-Cup porn star, he'd do it "just for me." So why can't I get just a little bit of flattery out of this?   I have hacked my way through life living by the credo of not letting people tell me what to do. It has for the most part, totally fucked me over. It has also made me a self-sufficient, self-reliant, independent, headstrong (if not above all, foolish) person. I recgonize now the points in my life where a little bit of "give" would have been greatly beneficial to me. It's too late to change the past, and has been since the moment slipped through my fingers. I don't want it to be too late for me and "this guy" by the time I get there. Three thousand miles is a fuck of a lot harder than 2 miles. If we can't get through these next few months, then we might not get through what's beyond them.  That  thought is what scares me the most.   I want him. I want all this to work out for us. There's a million qualities in him that make me think it just might. And yeah, one of them is the fact that I don't think he'll put up with my bullshit. Whispering some sweet nothings isn't bullshit, to me anyway. If he's not willing to budge, then that leaves me to be adaptable. I have no problem being adaptable, giving into whatever someone might want if I care enough about them. What I won't do, is beat someone over the head with my request, bending over backwards just to prove some obscure point and not getting anything in return. Because   that   is bullshit in its purest form.

      I was watching one of those addictive yet awful shows on E!, The High Price of Fame and it was all about sex and infidelity in Hollywood. Now how can you mention sex and infidelity in Hollywood without talking about porn?   You can't.   It got me thinking though, since I'm in this boat that I'm in (trying to save money and get my ass to California) - Would I do something morally questionable for the money I want/need to get where I want to go?   Absolutely.  I sleep with near-total strangers for nothing, because I think it's fun. Now I don't think I'd  fuck  someone for money... but if you put a wig and a bunch of make-up on me, I'd most likely put on a stupid teddy and let you take pictures of it. For some phat cash, of course.   There are just so many problems with being in that line of work. One is that it's easy. Almost too easy. I mean, I'm sure there are occupational hazards just like every other job in the world, but I'm not sure that those are any better than carpal tunnel. Although I suppose that could be a very real health risk too.   Porn is a (I heard this on the show) fourteen billion dollar a year industry. Fourteen billion fucking dollars, floating around out there, changing hands. And it's all perfectly legal, too.   I guess all that's left to say is, "I'm ready for my close-up."

      That's right, party people, I've got my very own Gmail account. It wasn't even that hard to procure. I just begged it off an Englishman. OK so I had to compliment the hell out of him first. Point being... I've got a Gmail account, I've got a Gmail account.   Sorry for gloating. I've been looking for one of these for a while and thought I would have to wait eons until it launched publicly to get one. Just goes to show what you never know could happen. So I guess I'm not really sorry for gloating.   Either way, you can't help but feel cool when you become one of the privileged few by being accepted or even  invited  to a secret party. It's a nice feeling, being one of the cool kids. Too bad you're such a dork, maybe I'd send you an invite! Ha!   OK so what else is new? Not much. It's been a few hours since my last post to Blogit (for a while anyway) and I already feel sort of free-er. Actually I think whatever I end up posting here, free of influence will be transferred to Blogit when (and if) I decide to return.   The most interesting thing will be to see if I can maintain whatever distance and lack of influence I achieve over the next week or so when (and if) I return. I'm addictive personality by nature, so I'm already sort of sweaty and jones-ing for my next Blogit post. Mind over matter (especially crappy matter) always prevails though. Always.

      So I have decided to leave Blogit for a while, to get away from the 'competition' and its detrimental effect on the integrity of my posts.   Here, there is no popularity ranking. Here, I'm not whoring for clicks because it makes me money. Here, I can just write and not have to worry about why. Which is why I wanted to start blogging in the first place.   I've vowed off Blogit for at least a week -- equal to the longest absence I took from it when I went on vacation to Vegas in May. I will still keep my subscription though and see what clarity I can get out of a little break from it.

      This is a new endeavor, because I'm fed up with who I've become on BlogIt networks. There's a whole culture of competition and you're Wonder Woman if you don't fall into it's traps. Not that there aren't some truly excellent writers and not that I don't like being in the top 50 on most days. I want to write somewhere that I'm not whoring for clicks though, and this is as good of a place as any, I suppose.   So... let's let the writing begin, huh?
