      Today I went to a Tam Tam on Mount Royal, and it kicked ass. Today in general kicked ass. Yay.

      What a day. So I saw Moneen in concert. I almost didn't go as I had no one to go with. Normally this wouldn't stop me; my best concert experiences were the ones I had when I used to go to shows alone. However, I fear I have grown accustomed to having someone there (Jon...) and now that I have no one to go with (Jon...) I am twice as lonely...Anyhow, completely off topic. Moneen are Gods. I was almost certain of this half way through the set, and then during their second to last song, while both guitarists were scaling the railings...Then playing guitar from the ledge of the bar...Then swinging from the rafters of L'X, it was then that I realized that they were Gods. The last time I was compelled to cry at a concert before tonight was at Radiohead ("Idioteque", does it every time). I needed to compliment them, so what better way then purchase them Popsicles (a new M.O. for Theresa? I think so). I presented the guitarist/singer with one, and his reponse was comparable to George's. I then asked if he would grant me an interview for the next time they're in Montreal (August 22 with Reggie & The Full Effect) and he agreed, and even offered me his e-mail address so we can make definite plans. The interview, of course, is for my personal project, which I am in love with.   I then met some of the coolest people I've ever met, Jackie and Phil. They know who Cursive are. They like '80s music. They are two sassy people. I hope to see them again very soon. Rock on.  Oh, and on a note which compared to everything that has happened in the past 4 hours seems rather minor, I'm getting my lip pierced next week.

      Sigh. I am tired and suffering from severe writer's block, although I felt it necessary to make my "pre-dawn hours" post. I really have nothing much to say...My hopes are crushed for the Alexisonfire photo contest because it turns out that people actually entered the afforementioned contest. And I thought I was the only one.  I managed to get my Alexisonfire review for my personal project done... Ah, personal project. The bane of my existance. I can't think of anything to write for Dave Grohl other than "what a cool dude". Somehow I don't think this will impress the judges. Perhaps my writing will peak around the 4 o'clock hour...Who knows.  Perhaps it is due to my strange eating/sleeping habits, but the only thing that's going through my head right now is "put a bullet in my sister's face" from "The Philosophical Significance Of Shooting My Sister In The Face" by Alexisonfire. Oh boy, I'm going insane again!  Oh George, when can we be together again?                                                                                         -Theresaonfire

      There appears to be a bit of confusion regarding dates and times. Pretty much all my blogs have been posted at some un-Godly hour, for examples the one from earlier today (much earlier today). When I say " today  I participated in a mad hatter tea party", I mean  yesterday , although since I have become Captain Nocturnal my perception is somewhat off. So please, use your judgement. If it's two in the morning and I say that I was at a tea party that day, assume I mean  yesterday , unless otherwise mentioned...Because after all, I do have a soft spot pre-dawn tea parties.  I got my first batch of Alexisonfire pictures back, these are the ones from the show in June. They're good, but I don't know if they're gonna-win-the-Alexisonfire-picture-contest good. This worries me slightly. The deadline for said contest is tomorrow (yes,  tomorrow ) at midnight. I'm hoping that the pictures form the other Alexisonfire concert....The one where they dedicated a song to me....Turn out better. I'm thinking they will, but I have been wrong in the past ( please see  Moreman, Sean  ).   Jonathan Michael Milukow, stop being such a trouble-making scamp.

      Today I participated in a mad hatter tea party, complete with mad hats. I had a good time until some jerkface on a bike stole our lemonade. I hope the citric acid burned his mouth.  I have not been able to stop listening to Alexisonfire. I am slightly worried about my health. And sanity. My pictures from the last Alexisonfire show will be ready tomorrow, and I think I'm going to bring my other ones to a one hour place. I need them.  In semi-related news, I found out that Rufio and Motion City Soundtrack will be coming to Montreal on  October 7. I fell in love with Motion City Soundtrack, and this is the best news I have heard in awhile (oh, other than when ALEXISONFIRE DEDICATED A SONG TO ME...Which may or may not qualify as news). I will be there, no doubt, singing along. Hooray.

      Is the Alexisonfire Incident cooler than when I got to do the interlude during the Big D show? My life has a new meaning: Find the answer to this question.

      I opened my umbrella in the house today. I'm one of those people that still holds my breath and touches metal when I go over train tracks or pass a graveyard, so as you can imagine this was a frightening thing for me. " Oh no ", I thought. " Tonight is the Alexisonfire show. I don't want anything to go wrong ".  Ha. So I have this mad crush on George from Alexisonfire. I have had the pleasure to meet him twice now, and he was the nicest guy ever. The whole band is nice, but it was George that I talked to for the longest. I decided to give into the trend and purchase an Alexisonfire trucker hat, although I was unsure of whether such a hat would suit me. George was nearby (well, right in front of me), so I asked him for his opinion. He told me that it looked great. I was flattered, and immediately went to purchase a Popsicle, because hey, when I'm flattered there's nothing I like more than a frozen treat. I bought George a cherry Popsicle and brought it back to him. Upon delivering it to him, he was in awe. "Is this for me? But why?" he asked. "Well, you gave me your honest opinion on the hat, and I appreciate it", I replied. He then handed me some stickers, and I was on my way.  As soon as Alexisonfire started, I made sure I had a good view. I was very close to the stage...Close enough for George to see me after the first song, and then grab my head (well, my sassy new hat) and proclaim "I would like to dedicate the next song to this girl in the Alexisonfire hat and shirt. She bought me a Popsicle, which is cool. I like Popsicles and don't have them often. So thank you...This song is called 'A Dagger Through the Heart of St. Angeles' ". Needless to say, I was stunned, and then began to yell frantically, as "A Dagger Through The Heart Of St. Angeles" is one of my favourite Alexisonfire songs. I could have died then and been happy, but no, there was more to come.  So the pretty interlude starts, and Geroge walks over to where I'm standing, reaches down for my hand, pulls me up on stage, and after a moment (the most frightening moment of my life. I just waved. What do you do on stage when you're not in the band?) he began to slow dance with me. I...I can't even find the words to describe it. Of course, I had to be foolish and take a picture of us before we started dancing, but...Wow. Just...Wow. Yup. Wow pretty much sums it up. That, or SWEET JESUS ALEXISONFIRE DEDICATED A SONG TO ME/INVITED ME ON STAGE. Rock on.

      I was asked why I associate emo with weakness, etc. Well, after I posted the Summer Sanitarium blog, I went to check my daily rock news and came up with this:  Stock up on Kleenex, because the ever-emotional Dashboard Confessional are coming to town. Chris Carrabba's outfit will kick off a jaunt on Aug. 30 in Pittsburgh that ends Oct. 7 in St. Paul, Minn. Vendetta Red will open most dates. Dashboard Confessional's upcoming album, A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar, drops Aug. 12.  Yup. Good ol' Chris Carrabba.

      I would like to begin by saying that after a brief yet productive discussion with Seb at the videostore, several things were established. 1) Just because I have a blog doesn't mean I have to fill it with all that is emo 2) People associate emo and weakness because of a little something I have dubbed "The Feelings Factor" 3) Chris Carrabba sucks. There will be one emo reference in this blog, and it shall be marked with an asterix (*).  Without further ado, I would like to move onto the furthest thing from emo...Summer Sanitarium.  I am tired and my face is three shades darker due to the dirt that has embedded itself in my pores, but I saw the Deftones in concert. Yay. That means that I have seen 4 out of my 5 favorite bands in concert, the only band which I have not yet had the pleasure to see being the elusive Beastie Boys. Perhaps they are in Tibet with the Dalai Lama.  Anyhow, Summer Sanitarium was mediocre. Honestly, the Deftones could have walked out and banged metal poles against other metal poles, or possibly pewter or plastic poles, and I would have enjoyed it. However, if I was to forget about my love for the Deftones no matter what they do, I would say that it was a less than entertaining show, filled with forgotten words and silly, drunken banter which completely contradicted everything the Deftones have been saying in the past few weeks. But it was the Defotnes, so it kicked ass. And they did my favourite song first [Change (In The House of Flies)], so it kicked ass. And Chino kept doing this nifty little pelvic thrust/dance, so it kicked ass. I may or may not have said something to the effect of "Limp Bizkit have compeletely redeemd themselves in my mind", and I would like to clarify. I was amazed by the live show that Limp Bizkit put on, mainly because of what I call "The Incident" where I was mere minutes away from going to the Limp Bizkit show when my dreams were crushed by my friend's mother, who bluntly informed me that she did not want us taking in such filth, etc. Because of The Incident, I was devastated. I turned to emo* to ease my pain, and tucked my Limp Bizkit shirt away under my Cabbage Patch Doll and Pog collection, never to be seen again... Or so I thought. No, seriously though, I haven't worn it since then, and I doubt I will. I can't bring myself to do it. Even if they put on a great live show with pyrotechnics. Lotsa pyrotechincs.

      I would like to echo the "yay me" sentiment from last night's blog... I actually figured out how to publish it (after a long, long struggle). Also, the time stamp is wrong, I actually did start the blog mere minutes after Seb posted the challenge. I fear I don't have much to say, other than the name of the blog (Let It Burst And Bloom) is from the Cursive song "Sink To The Beat". I was torn between several different names, all from emo songs as it seemed to be the right thing to do.  The runner up was "Take In Restraint Like A Breath" from the Jimmy Eat World song "Crush". Oh Christine, how you will despise my blog. It has become everything you are against...Emo, feelings, the "post-hardcore" music scene...I'm sorry in advance. I truly am. But c'mon..A blog? Is there anything you would consider more emo? Especially when someone like me is exposed to it's glory. I want to put pictures and other miscellany on my blog site, but I don't know how. If only I had listened in computers class (damn you, Carl).

      Well, this is it. I win, I guess.... I am the first memebr of the Seb Fan Club to have a Seb-ordered blog (you don't count, Steph). A frightening story, I started this blog only 8 minutes after Seb posted his blog challenge... Strange. I am terribly exhausted right now, so I really don't have much more to say other than "yay me" for actually getting this done... My last blog failed miserably, but at that time I was also fairly certain that Chris Carrabba was the secong coming of Christ, so y'know...

      Current music: " Clone High  Theme Song" by Abandoned Pools  Okay, I may be out of my slump, but I not out of my crazy stage. Last night I downloaded the theme song to  Clone High , and it's all I've been listening to. I've even started to sing along (no one has been home all weekend, of course). It's a great song. It's a great show. I have a crush on Abraham Lincoln. I went to the web site and found out who does all the voices, and it seems to be pretty much the cast of SNL, MadTV, and Scrubs. Also, the show is on hiatus. At The Drive-In went on hiatus. Then they broke up. Basically, they're never going to make another episode, ever. And then a band I really like is going to break up. Hiatus. What a scary word. On a more sane note (but only slightly, trust me) some of the pictures I took of the Escape Engine are on their web site. Check it out at www.theescapeengine.net,  then click on media, and I think mine are Warped Tour #2 and #3 or something...Basically the one with me in the picture is one from my camera. And the one of Jesse dancing on a van.   Clone High, energetic and engaging, Clone High, our angst is entertaining, Clone Highhhhhh.... I should be heavily medicated.

      Current music: "Emergency, Emergency!" by the Promise Ring  Well, my life sure pulled itself out of that slump pretty damn fast. Or perhaps it's just the fact that I have a bag of peanuts and some milk and I am quite content in my own little world of peanut fairies with milk hats. Or maybe it's because of the song I'm listening to. If you listen to this song, you realize that everything will be okay, because nothing is as bad as SOS VERY EMERGENCY! was for the Promise Ring. I dyed my hair black last night, and there are few things I love more than waking up with freshly dyed hair because it's still so damn soft that baby lambs would be jealous. And if there's one thing I know, it's how to tell if a baby lamb is jealous.  I may or may not have a job soon at a music store, which makes me swoon with excitement. If I'm not cocky enough about music now, I sure as Hell will be soon! Jeez. So I actually have some good questions to ask Moneen when I interview them on Monday, now all I have to do is 1) get money for the show and 2) get out of Ambassadors early. I don't know which will be harder. I actually went and got my Radiohead pictures, and there are a few that are worthy of being used in my glorious personal project, albeit they need to be cropped. I shall presently scan them and get this baby on the road. I went to the Strung Out concert tonight! But I didn't go in. I merely escorted Jeremy, Marco and Neil to their show, which I hope they enjoy. The peanuts have made me feel ill.

      Current music: "Roses In Water" by Sunny Day Real Estate  My life has hit a low point.  I have no motivation to do anything other than listen to the same three songs over and over, whine incessantly about my personal project which I secretly love and wish to wed, and watch  Clone High . Then I fall asleep, wake up, and start the horrible process over again. Oh, I forgot to mention the part where I don't ever leave the house because I'm always in front of the computer. My tan/burn from Radiohead has been tarnished by the unearthly glow that eminates from my computer. I have plenty of motivation to leave my house. For example: 1) My Radiohead pictures need to be picked up. My precious, precious babies have been ready for a few days but I haven't mustered the strength to get them. It's more fun this way, I can guess what they look like. 2) Seeing as none of my friends live in my house, I will eventually have to venture outside to see them, unless I am able to get them to come over, as was the case today with Christine. 3) My tan/burn from the Radiohead show needs to be fixed, perhaps with a little help from my friend Mr. Sun. Wait....Me and Mr. Sun are fighting. I don't like him anymore. He's a jerk face. Tonight I made the mistake of venturing out to see a concert. I came home only to realize that I had missed  Clone High  and I have a cold. Based on the discovery that if I leave my house bad things happen to me, I have decided that it would be best if I never leave my bedroom again. After watching  Clone High  each night, I will ready myself for the next episode which is a full 24 hours away. That way I can't miss it and perhaps I will find out who Abe Lincoln will go to prom with. I hope it's me. No, i am not making reference to the fact that some quiz says I am Joan of Arc. I want Abe Lincoln to ask Theresa to the prom. Ooh...I like that. From now on Theresa will refer to herself in the third person. Theresa is going to get some grape juice and work on her Personal Project. Sir Personal Project. Theresa just knighted it.  Him . Theresa just knighted  him.

      I spent most of last night and the early hours of this morning creating pictures in Paint. It's very theraputic. Then I went to my bedroom and tried to write my thingy about Dave Grohl for my Personal Project, and I fell asleep on my papers. Then I woke up becuase my neck hurt and the paper was stuck to my face and some of the pencil had come off on my face and I had to laugh becuase hey, Pencil Face. Now I am listening to Big D And The Kids Table, which is surprising because all I seem to listen to anymore is Go With The Flow by Queens Of The Stone Age. And by "listen to", I mean "watch the video, because the video is my God and I worship said video". Oh boy I'm insane...ly tired! Ha ha ha ha ok. It's like noon. I need more sleep. I think I will go and get some more sleep. But I have to eat something first. But I don't know what. Hmm. and I should probably read the newspaper, y'know, find out what's going on in the world. Conan O'Brien was a repeat last night. Is this what my life had been reduced to? Blogging about food and Conan O'Brien? There was a time when I was able to blog about wonderful backstage experiences and fairies and a magical place called Boston.  Those times are gone. Those times are gone.   Oh, I also had this weird dream invloving Carlos D. from Interpol, and now I have a big crush on him, but Interpol are coming to town, so yay. We shall wed. And another thing, yesterday I was just sitting in front of them computer and I sneezed, and then I freaked out because the computer/printer/speakers/everything else had gone off, and I was like "Damn! Power failure! American bastards!" but then I realized that I had kicked the off button on the power bar under my computer when I sneezed. And this is the most interesting thing that has happened to me since Warped Tour. OMG WTF LOL! Sigh.

      Current music: Winter Month Novelty by At The Drive-In  I have calmed down a considerable amount since my last post, and I would like to imagine that I am thinking clearly now. I have some things to say about the Radiohead show. First and foremost, it was the best show I've ever seen, tied with the time I saw them two years ago. It's been three days since the show, and I'm still saying that it was the best show ever, so I guess it must be true. I had my doubts, but they lasted only a few minutes. You see, I am a fan of nu-Radiohead. Kid A, Amnesiac...Basically everything that everyone else hated. When they played two years ago, they had just released Amnesiac, so I got to hear a lot of what I wanted to hear, plus they did their good old stuff like High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, Talk Show Host...Basically all their stuff that EVERYONE loves. Well this show was different. I think they did every single song off Hail To The Thief. They did not do the three afforementioned songs that everyone loves, nor did they do staples such as No Surprises, Optimistic, The Bends, My Iron Lung, Climbing Up The Walls, Dollars and Cents...The list goes on. I was surprised, but I didn't realize how many songs they had omitted until I got home and thought about it long and hard, because I was so impressed with the show. They did do a lot of other great songs, like Idioteque, Paranoid Android, Karma Police, Street Spirit (Fade Out), Just, Kid A, and THAT list goes on. So I guess the two shows combined was the best thing ever. Thom Yorke is definitely still insane, it's good to see consistency in that department, he spent the night yelling at bugs.   I am tired now and will head off to my sleeping chambers. I leave you with the words of Thom Yorke: "We hope that you choke, that you choke".

      The isn't the best time for me to be blogging. You see, while my blog should be filled with puppies and love and happy stories about the wonderful Radiohead concert (and oh, it was wonderful), there are things that are frustrating me and thus prohibiting me from writing a nice review blog. You see, I was supposed to have recieved my tickets to Radiohead from 99.9 the Buzz. They didn't send them. I e-mailed the station to figure out what gives, and recieved no reply. So I use my baby-sitting money, plus I owe my mother $26,so I could get my Radiohead ticket. I get home from the Radiohead show and check my email, and sure enough a letter hath arrived from the station..."Hey Theresa! You can go pick up your tickets at the Guest List! Bring ID and have a good show!". The email came at 3:30. By that time, I had already been waiting in line for...oh, about SEVEN HOURS, and was more worried about my BURNING FACE. So the Buzz came through, hooray, but too late, boo.  Next, I have been waiting for MONTHS, even YEAR(s) to hear about the follow up to my favourite Big Wreck album, The Pleasure and the Greed. Well I go to the rock news on 99.9 the Buzz's web site (yup. I do love the Buzz) and find out that Ian Thornley, the singer and guiatrist from Big Wreck, is now the EX-singer and EX-guitarist from Big Wreck. But that's not why he was in the news. Get this...He's just been signed to CHAD KROEGER'S record label. Another stellar Canadian musician bites the dust.  Adding fuel to the fire which is my frustration, I forgot to put on sun screen today, and because of how I was wearing my hair and which way I was facing one half of my forehead is RED while the other is WHITE. one arm is RED, while the other is WHITE. One side of my nose is RED while one side is WHITE. I look downright silly. Grr. Now for the nice stuff. HOLY JESUS RADIOHEAD KICKED ASS I..I really don't know what to say. Well, I can start by saying that Thom Yorke is plum crazy. He was yelling at the bugs on his piano...And he continued to yell at (invisible?) bugs for the rest of the night, long after they had fled his piano. "Idioteque" was incredible, as I knew it would be. And it happened pretty much like I predicted it, complete with Thom and I eloping in the Spanish countryside. Although they didn't do many of my favourite songs ("Talk Show Host", "My Iron Lung", "Dollars and Cents", "Like Spinning Plates"...The lost goes on and on) it was still an incredible concert. I think I'm going to be sick, so I'll write later when I am not so frustrated and my face doesn't feel like I scrubbed (half of it) with a Brillo pad.

I'm trying to get some rest, from all the unborn chicken voices in my head...what's thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?"                                                                                -"Paranoid Android"  "She looks like the real thing, she tastes like the real thing, my fake plastic love"...                                                                    -"Fake Plastic Trees"   "While you make pretty speeches on being cut to shreads, you feed me to the lions"...                                                                    -"Like Spinning Plates"  It's today. Sweet Jesus it's today. In less than 6 hours I will be on my way to Parc Jean Drapeau (Jeanny Flaggy Park, says Dr. J LOL OMG WTF) to see the 'Head. I was walking home from the bus stop early this morning, and all I could think was "R-A-D-I-O...H-E-A-D is the way to go". If you say it properly it rhymes. Kinda like the Sam Roberts song, but different. I'm listening to Idioteque now. My favourite song by my favourite band. Fuck, I can see it now. The night is getting old. Thom is running out of steam...Or is he? They're about to leave. You can tell. Johnny is slowly edging away. Phil is glanicing behind his shoulder. Thom's not saying much. He wants you to think it's over. Then all of a sudden it happens. You don;t notice at first, you think perhaps it's a techincal glitch. Then you hear it again. A blip. You look for Johnny. Sure enough, there he is. Crouched over a machine with wires and cables protruding left and right; funny knobs and buttons everywhere else. Johnny has begun to turn them, and you know that's it. Phil starts. A slow, even beat at first. Then he uses the kick pedal, or what ever the Hell you kids are calling it these days. Soon, the two sounds come together. The crowd knows what's going on. A cheer rises from the audience, from the front first and spreading. Ed, still wearing his guitar, pulls out the shaker things which aren't quite maracas. They're more like those egg-shakers, but not eggs. Thom looks around the stage, content with the way things are progressing. He begins to sing Idioteque. Then he gets off stage and proposes to me and we run off to Spain to take advantage of the Valencian Independant Music Scene. And that, my friends, is the story of Idioteque as played at a Radiohead show, otherwise known as The Story of Jesus. Now I have to go to bed. It's a long flight to Spain.

      Current music: Bro Hymn Tribute by Pennywise, followed by Like Spinning Plates by Radiohead  Well, turns out I don't have West Nile virus, just the flu. Before you mock me, let me tell you that the symptoms are pretty much the same, and the jackass at the hospital didn't even test me for West Nile virus, so they can kiss off and expect to be sued if I die. I have left my friend Emily in charge of all legal matters regarding my untimely death. My computer, however, definitely has a virus. A virus which I thought I got rid of oh, a good SIX times, but the bastard keeps coming back. I can't open links, my Microsoft Works won't open (which scares me because it;s where my personal project sleeps) and all kinds of other shenanigans that I figured only lawn nymphs were capable of. I hope to remedy the situation. In better news, Conan O'Brien is a God. It's cool when you watch his show for two consecutive nights, because he makes reference to the previous show, and you're all like "I get it!".  In even better news, I'm going to a show tonight at L'X where I get to meet this guy from Nova Scotia who I've been talking to on MSN who likes Alexisonfire and is in a band that's playing... In EVEN BETTER NEWS, I recieved an e-mail yesterday from my future husband. I'm inviting him to prom, regardless of the fact that he' in a band, at least 10 years older than I am, and lives in New York City. He'd best come, seeing as we're ENGAGED and all.  Oh, and on a minor note.....                                                  SWEET JESUS IT'S THE FRIGGING RADIOHEAD SHOW IN LIKE 30 HOURS

      Word of the day: VIRUS. Never a good word, unless someone is making some kind of virus cookies, virus being a secret sode for chocolate chip...Unfortunately that was not the context I was going to use it in. So if you watch the news, you know about this worm virus-y thing that some 37 year old guy who lives in his mother's basement concocted. It goes into to your computer and randomly shuts it down, not before delivering this charming message about Remote Procedure Call being terminated or some BS. So my computer had it, and my mother (God bless her soul) who has been influenced by my grandfather (God bless his soul) was convinced it was because we have too much stuff on our computer. I was forced to delete many, many files, including necessities, such as "The Announcemtent For A Swim Team Meeting In February" and "Tabs For Armageddon by Alkaline Trio". They will be missed. So I turned to the Alexisonfire message board, as I do whenever I am posed with a situation like the one I was facing, and noticed a thread called "virus". I read it with a sort of sick fascination...I realized at that moment that I was no longer battling some strange malfunction..I was battling a full blown virus! Needless to say I was pumped with adrenalin (by my manservant who was standing behind me with a syringe. I can no longer produce it naturally, a tragic story for another night) and immediately went out and purchased much commando gear at my local Army Surplus store. Six hours later, I had almost defeated the virus, which I will name Siddartha. It was a vicious battle. Siddartha would pop up, distracting my nimble fingers furiously at work, and then I would press some buttons and yell stuff in Spanish. In the end, neither party won. Siddartha's spawn (who I affectionately call "Pumpkin Head") still inhabits my computer. I am unaware of how to chase the bugger from his nest, but it will be done. I swear to God it will be done. Now, two days ago I decided I would go hang out by the lake at 11 at night. I have made wiser decisions in my time (like sticking hot iron rods through my eye lids. MmmmmMM!) and this was not one of them. I was attacked by mosquitoes. It sucked, to say the least (and no pun intended). All up and down my back, up and down my legs, and (the Mother of them all) on on my thumb. I'm sure the bastard got a healthy supply of my sweet, sweet blood, I mean, the THUMB!! It's known for it's supple, bloody texture...(sarcasm level=8.7). So today I wake up with a headache. I never get headaches. Then my whole body starts to hurt. Then I nearly vomit (twice). Then I ask my mom to check my glands, and sure enough the right side of my neck is swollen. I am with fever, with cramps, and with child. Just kidding. But seriously, I have come to the conclusion that I either have West Nile Virus, or I was bitten by were-mosquitoes and soon I will take on full mosquito form and stalk the night looking for thumbs. I am going to some sort of medical establishment tomorrow, and with the way they're run these days I'll probably die before the actual tests are preformed. This presents a problem, because Radiohead is on Friday. I will have to tell them to be sure to keep me alive till at least 10 at night. If I die, however, I leave anyone reading this reponsable for making sure Thom Yorke consumes my ashes. It's been a dream of mine for quite some time. If I am alive tomorrow, I will make an effort to post something. Until then, goodbye cruel world. Oh, and on a different note, it was pointed out by my dear friend Darren that I neglected to add "Sabotage" as one of my favourite videos. I apologize to the Beastie Boys, who regularly read my blog, and assure them that I love the video and they're still my third favourite band.

      I wish it was the Eighties. Then I could justify the fact that all I've been listening to for the past two hours is "Love Will Tear Us Apart" by Joy Division. Meh. I want to do a cover of this song. There are, however, a few problems. 1) I am not currently in a real band (no matter what I say about The Dubyas being a credible high school band) and 2) I have no idea how to tab out songs. I can read tabs and then perhaps speed them up for a Me First and the Gimmie Gimmies effect, but other than that I'm screwed. Maybe I should just listen to the song and shut up.  After going over my list of music videos that I really like, I realized that I forgot a couple. For starters, there's "The United States Of Whatever" by Liam Lynch (the non-puppet version).  ... I'm sure there are others that I can't think of right now...I thought of them last night...Damn.

      I got my Warped Tour pictures back and they kick so much ass that I want to cry...Pictures of Fat Mike drinking beer...Spike with his hand in his shirt...Me and Andrew W.K....The list goes on. Speaking of lists, I was watching a  music video and I suddenly had the urge to list my favourite music videos.  1) "Idioteque" by Radiohead ---It's my favourite song ever, so I have to like the music video...It rocks.  2) "Go With The Flow" by Queens Of The Stone Age ---How they let something so sexually explicit be broadcast on TV is beyond me. The video is the hottest thing I've ever seen. Josh Homme is hot      when he's black, if you've seen the video you know what I mean.  3) "Pulmonary Archery" by Alexisonfire ---Jeez, there's no sex (or even nudity) in this video, and it's hot. George plays the role of the screamo frontman too well, what with wrapping the      microphone wire around his neck and all. And he jumps around a lot. And Dallas does this cute little dance that makes me oh so excited.   4) "Tonight, Tonight" by the Smashing Pumpkins ---Inspired by George Milies, who is a God. The space men...The zeppelin...Billy Corgan in a top hat (this does NOT qualify as hot). What more    could you ask for?  5) "Jane Says (live)" by Jane's Addiction ---I wish I was Perry Farrell. Or at least a good friend of Perry Farrell. Nonetheless, I love this video and I wait with bated breath for the day I can      attend a Jane's Addiction concert and dance around like the people in the video.  6) "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" by Radiohead ---I like to think I'm a pretty big Radiohead fan, but I hadn't seen this video until the Radiohead Live N Large thing at the Colisee. I was watching     the video with a guy named Mark who I had just met that night, and after it was done I asked him what he thought. He said, and I quote,     "It's beautiful". I think that's supposed to make me want him really bad. It is really nice...All black and white...Slow motion and fast motion...     Thom, doing weird stuff...  7) "Tribute" by Tenacious D ---I like this video because Jack Black rips open his shirt.   8) "Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)" by the Deftones ---A terrible video by most standards...The singing in the video doesn't match up with the song...Shitty location (some kind of parking garage)..But     deliverance comes in the form of a very thin, very young Chino Moreno. Oh Chino, when will we be together?  9) "Buddy Holly" by Weezer ---The origins of the Buddy Holly glasses? Who knows. All that matters is Brian Bell mouths "I love you" to someone. Yet another unintentionally      hot video. And I mean  unintentionally .   9) "The Difference" by Big D and The Kids Table ---A great song, but not the greatest video in the world...Wait...This video actually kicks ass! Oh yeah, it's because  I'M IN IT !!       HOORAY!!  10) "Danger, High Volatge"/"Gay Bar"/"This Jagged Alibi" by Electric 6, Electric 6, and The Escape Engine, respectively. ---If you've seen the videos by Electric 6, you would understand why I like them so. One involves Abe Lincoln and hot pants, the other involves    a woman (whose voice is supplied by none other than Jack White) and a moose with glowing genitals.     I like the Escape Engine video because it's good, and because hey, I drove home with those guys. We went to McDonalds. I WATCHED THEM GET     DRUNK and there they are, in a video.   Radiohead in 5 days. I can barely contain myself. AHHHHHHHH. There.

           I actually had something written here about the Warped Tour, but it was too personal (even for a blog). So if it tickles your fancy to hear about the best two days of my life, ask me.       I miss someone so much right now that I feel physically sick. This isn't cool.

      Wow...I haven't updated my blog in quite some time..And I place the blame on my mortal enemy, school. We used to be friends. Oh, we were friends once. Then we got in a fight. Grade two. Ms. McDougall. So many things went wrong that year... I didn't have Ms. Cossover, my Scholastic book order went to Evan Joslin, and I was unappreciated in that class. Oh, and my asshole music teacher yelled at me. Anyhow, me and school are on all right terms, although I am unusually busy. Student council, ambassadors, debating, governing board, newspaper, yearbook...I'm going to burn out, especially over debating. RJ is gone. Just up and left me and McGuckin to fend for ourselves. And we did. We have taken over debating, which is all right because it means we have a dozen or so kids at our disposal. But that's nothing. Student council, I have like 60 kids that I can yell at, get them to bring me stuff, brainwash them...They hang onto every word I say. Being president rocks. Mouhahah.  So prom is coming up (9 months. I could have a child before prom happens...) and I have been thinking about who i want to take as a date. I need a gimmick for my dress, first of all. But that's secondary to the date. Here's my plan: Ask as many rock stars as I can. I figure if i ask at least 10 rock stars, at least one will show up, and maybe I would have to -wait for it- TURN DOWN ROCK STARS! So far the lucky (oops. forgot the "un") guys are Carlos D. from Interpol and George from Alexisonfire. Sigh. None of this will make up for who i actually want to go to prom with. *cough* kevin *cough*. But alas...Will I ever talk to him again? Okay, I'm being over-dramatic. Of course I will, I have his email, etc. but nonetheless, i want him to come to prom with me.  So pretty much everyone in the entire world, living and dead, knows who I like now. Tee hee.  Hey, I love the voice of the guy form Limp (not Limp Bizkit. Limp). Yeah, so I don't have much else to say. School takes up way too much of my time, but I'm doing really well so far. even in math, my most despised of classes. Godforsaken mathematics.  Alkaline Trio, Motion City Soundtrack, Deftones, Big D and the Kids Table...These are all shows I am looking forward to going to. Prom dates? Perhaps.

      Current music: "Used For Glue" by Rival Schools   Alas, I am back at school. Glorious, glorious school. Yes, it  was  the greatest summer of my life, but I missed the decorum, the smell of Axe deodorant wafting through the halls and, of course, the extra-curricular activities! My roster this year looks something like this: President of the Student Council..Head Ambassador..Manager of the swim team..Editor of the school newspaper..Governing Board member..Yearbook committee..Bouncer..Senior debater (which could possibly end up as co-head of the Debating Club...)..Member of the Central Students Committee. I want to join Grad Committee and I definitely want to MC the Variety Show and the Fashion Show. Nerds unite! I found out some wonderful news today, Thursday, Thrice and the Deftones will be playing a show in Montreal on November 25. I will be attending this show. The past few days have been trying; I love Interpol more and more by the minute, and everytime I think of them (which is  way  more often than you would think) I am reminded that I do not have tickets to their show next Wednesday. It makes me want to die. I think I will show up anyways, perhaps pull a little "oh, I'm here to interview the band", a la D-board Con. I would also like to gove Carlos D. some flowers. I...I'm speechless just thinking about him. His hair. His clever smirk. The fact that he doesn't understand the concept of casual dress. I also have some questions I would like to ask him, mainly "may we get married?"  I went downtown again over the weekend, and of course, more wacky hijinks ensued. Memorable moments: Walking past Musique Plus and being accosted by some male squeegee punks. Our conversation went something like this:  Punk: Hey, how are you? Theresa: (silent) Punk: Do you like chaos? Theresa: What, like the noun? The theory of? I don't understand your question.  Punk: (unintelligable) Theresa: (silent, backs away slowly) Punk: Hey, there's a show tonight. You should come. Do you drink? Or smoke? Theresa: Uh, no, I'm straight-edge. Punk: Do you like casual sex? Theresa: (with fear in my eyes) I'm straight-edge. Punk: Spend one night with us and I guarantee you won't be straight-edge anymore. Theresa: Yeah, that's nice. I'm going to go now...It was nice talking to you. Punk: So you'll come to the show tonight? It's at Cafe Chaos. Theresa: See you there (runs frantically) I also went into this awesome sex store where I met this flamboyantly gay man who reminds me of Darryl from Black and Blue. How I miss my dear Darryl. Sigh, I really must go to more raves. Anyhow, I love this guy and this guy loves my skirt, so it all works. He made me try on these angel wings becasue he knew I would fall instantly in love with them. And I did. I will be going downtown again this Saturday, my agenda involves a Buddhist meditation class and then some serious vintage shopping on Mount Royal. I must begin the hunt for my prom dress. Oh, I also though a lot about what I want to do in terms of my weird obsession with weird things...If you were there, you would understand a bit more...I'm sure I will post much about it in the near future.

      Current music: "Are We Really Happy With Who We Are Right Now?" by .moneen.  I had a wonderful evening. I went downtown with Lauren, Julia and Frankie, which means- you guessed it- return of the Downtown Four. We have had so many wonderful adventures downtown...Monkey-walking down Ste. Catherines...Getting creeped out by skeezy people from Massachusetts outside the sketchy Vietnamese noodle place...Putting chopsticks in my skirt...Protesting and then getting kicked out of the Complexe Desjardins because we still had our protest signs...So many things. Anyhow, we hadn't been downtown for awhile, so we went for lovely Pan-Asian cuisine, followed by the finest ice cream McDonalds has to offer (the blood-curdling scream emitted by me when i dropped the milkshake...Priceless), then we walked around and went for coffee at our #1 hangout, the Cafe Depot (pronounced Cayfe Depit, like the Americans call it). while we were there, I imitated the Necklace Incident of 2001. A classic. We were sitting there, our usual spot, when all of a sudden a man from outside begins banging on the window and gesturing to Frankie. We're thinking he wants the time, so we gesture back "9:30". He looks confused and then shows us his watch through the glass, and then we're equally confused. Finally Frankie has the good sense to go outside and find out what the Hell this buffoon wants. She comes back, slighty perturbed, and says that he was wondering if the ring on her finger meant she was married. She told him no. So then this guy comes inside, pulls up a chair and sits next to us. He asks us if we're tourists, something that I get asked waaaaay too much. We told her we weren't, then he tells us he's from Morocco. We didn't care all that much, he was speaking fast French and we were all pretty confused. Frankie then decides to tell him a lovely anecdote about Spain. He took this as a sign of acceptance, and then proceded to ask us for a pen so he could GIVE HER HIS NUMBER. She took it, then we excused ourselves and ran like the bloody wind. It was funny. Poor Frankie. This guy was at least 36. At least. Anyhow, we got to go through my beloved Dome of Sound, which is located on the bottom floor of the Complexe Desjardins near the washrooms. Then we were talking about our favourite teachers, and I mentioned my beloved Mr. Lawrence, who was my english teacher for exactly two weeks in grade 7. I was switched out of his class because the school can't make a schedule to save their lives and I was never in his class again because he got cancer and had to go on sick leave. I would occasionally see him going to the restaurants near my old hangout, the videostore, and I thought I saw him fairly recently. Anyhow, I mentioned how I saw his name in the agenda this year and how I was excited he would be teaching again, and this was met by a chorus of "He's dead". Now, I consider myself to be fairly up to date with school gossip thanks to the fact that I'm way to close with much of the staff and administration, but I never heard anything about Mr. Lawrence dying. Seriously. I'm sure I saw him not that long ago, and I'm sure I would have heard something about my favourite english teacher dying, and I saw his name in the agenda under the list of teachers. Perhaps I saw his ghost and he has a message for me. That would be cool. So tonight was great fun, we have decided to do the same thing next weekend. Perhaps we will also go joyriding with Frankie. Oh, and I have decided that Liberal Arts is the way to go. Hooray anthropology! Oh, and I've been accepted for the exchange program, so I have to decide where to go. And soon. My permenant release form is due in November. Sigh. I feel sick, hence I will go to bed.

      So apparently my computer is almost working again, hence I am actually writing this from  my very own house!  Last night I went to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and it wasn't as lame as I thought it would be, they actually had all the same people acting it out as they did last year...Only Plastik Patrick wasn't there. Tonight is the Big D and the Kids Table concert, and I'm getting excited. Finally. I've been so busy over the past week I haven't had time to even think about it. Sigh. Sofia finally came through with the Moneen pictures, and I want to marry them (the pictures, and to a lesser extent, the band). I wuv them.  I've been hoping you're moping around the streets again, I've been tripping from sipping that dripping dirty water tap, I've been poking a voodoo doll that you do not know I made, for you, of you, let's see what needles do.  I love Hot Hot Heat too. Yesterday I went and handed my CV out to a billionty million places in Fairview...Actually, to Music World, HMV, Cafe Depot, Second Cup, Amnesia, the Body Shop, and Coles. I think that's it. Meh. I need a job; I want to go on the New York/Washington Trip. I'm bored. I'm going to go sleep.

      *yawn* I am so damn tired, but alas I am not at home so I can't go to sleep. I slept soooo much today...My body hates me. "Sleep is essential! See? Essential! I used your word!" says Kenny from Moneen. What a night that was. and what a night I had on Tuesday. Ah, yes. So nice to be back in the swing of things...Going out to a show, asking rock stars to prom and then being proposotioned by the afforementioned rock stars. Oh, to be a celibate groupie. If only I was a slut, how much fun I would have. Anyhow, I got some incredible pictures at the Motion City Soundtrack/Rufio show. What a fun night. Despite the fact that MCS weren't allowed to bring their merch into Canada, and the only size sweaters that Rufio had was XL. MCS are really nice guys, and their CD is definitely one of the best I've heard in awhile, aside from "How To Start A Fire" by Further Seems Forever. And the lads from Rufio were charming and friendly, as usual... And when I say "charming", I mean..Well, "charming", I guess. Heh. Nevermind. *blushes* So Alec and I are going to Nationals for Debating in Calgary in November. This should be fun. Me. Alec. A small space. Half a dozen or so private school kids. I reckon we'll have to have them surgically removed from Alec's fist and/or forehead. Pft. I have no motivation to debate.Do I have some pretty blonde girl waiting for me in Alberta? No. All there is in Alberta for me is pain and suffering. Pain...and suffering.  Hey, did I mention how awesome my pictures from MCS/ Rufio are?  Bah, it's hot. Perhaps it's my new, snazzy, scholarly sweater. It's woolen. Hooray for sheep. Dammit, Sofia, get the infernal Moneen pictures developed. Wench. I will not stand for such wenchery. So I'm moving to Germany. I wish Germany was spelled with a 7.  7ermany.  Yes, that will do.

      Current music: "Vacant Skies" by Sparta  My stomach hurts so much that I wish I was dead. Have I ever been so nervous in my life? No. Well..Mybe when i had to sing Bro Hymn on stage in front of 50 000 people..Nah, I'm definitely more nervous now. I am in Calgary. It is 6:59 am here, and I have to be at this school to debate in less than an hour. Yes, the Debate That Never Was. I haven't written shit, and now it feels like little demon goats ( i saw goats yesterday) are tearing at my insides. I have been up since 3:57 Calgary time, trying to work on my debate. It so isn't worth it anymore. Is this my official resignation from the brutal sport that is debating? Perhaps. I am not keen to go to anymore tournaments anymore; way too much stress. I hate talking in front of people. But alas, in an hour I have to go B.S. my way through a 7 minute speech and 3 minutes of cross ex. Twice. And then an 8 minute speech on a tpoic that I am givven a few minutes before I have to debate it. FOUR TIMES. I'm going to be sick, for real. I wish I as at home....non-debating or whatever the opposite of debating is. Agreeing? Whatever.

That being said, the two videos I watch the most are "So Alive" by Ryan Adams and "The District Sleeps Alone Tonight" by The Postal Service. They're so awesome!

      Hmm...Almost two months since I updated...What has happened... Well, lots of depressing news, such as the untimely break-up of Further Seems Forever. Chris Carrabba  sucked  in that band, but jason was good, and apparently he was an asshole about it all and left the band while they were recording...Damn. Secondly, last night I found out the Kevin is leaving the Escape Engine, which makes me sad because I'm never ever going to see him again and I'm going to die a horrible slow painful death without ever finishing our conversation about how George W. Bush is a cowboy and how Clarity is the ultimate break-up album and how poutine kicks ass even if it did come from McDonalds and tasted like crap and Dom called it cheese fries and gravy and Dom wanted me to order children in French wasn't that funny? Wow. What a terrible weekend. In more lighthearted news... Uh... The Get-Up Kids are coming to town. I saw Hot Hot Heat in concert. I finished my personal project. I'm going to Japan next year. I'm going to Spain after that. I'm going out with my debating partner. Vans Warped Tour is August 13. The Escape Engine might be there. Kevin will not. ... Damn.

      ARE YOU HAPPY NOW, CHRISTINE? All right, so it's early in the morning but I had to wake up to see who won the election. Also, I'm just typing without spell-checking, so if there are misspelled words, I apologize. Liberals won, w00t. I'm a bad Liberal. Anyhow, today is the Pennywise concert, so I get to talk to Randy and be all nostalgic for the summer. Maybe Christine will see creepy dancing guy. Maybe not. What else... Uh we went to see Seb at work but at first it was some greasy guy. Then Seb was there. And I bought a skirt. Oh, and I'm house/dog-sitting next week, then my uncle from California is coming down, which is kicking rad. I need some CDs, like Muse and the new Beastie Boys. I was invited to go see Sparta and Incubus in Toronto with Ez, but I'm going to be house-sitting, so that isn't happening. Which makes me sad because I miss At The Drive-In. Prom happened and Alec wore his kilt and it was funny and cool. I kept lifting it. My tattoos aren't healing well and I think I just might go get them checked out tomorrow, but we'll see. That's all for now.

      So yesterday, some messed up stuff happened. Me, Hailey, Kinsley and Steph had about 3 hours to kill in Ste. Anne-de-Bellevue. First, we went to this second-hand store. I bought a sleazy Jackie Collins book and Kinsley bought this neon green hat that says Amstel Beer and this awesome pair of glasses that look like they belong to Duran Duran. Next, we went to the dollar store. Kinsley, Steph and Hailey bought these temporary tattoos and I bought hideously ugly nails; the kind that black women from Harlem have with sparkles and flowers on them that are too damn long to do anything with. We decided to go sit by the lake and apply our newly purchased accessories. On our way to the boardwalk, we passed a delivery truck with the back open. I casually remarked, "Hey, a truck filled with beer with the back open". Oh, and Kinsley, Steph and Hailey had taken 4 Wake-Ups each. Anyhow, this woman sitting near the truck starts to laugh, and we're pretty sure she was on crack, Me and Kinsley continue on to the boardwalk. About 30 seconds later Steph and Hailey come running towards us, and are like, "Guys! We have to move!" Steph had crawled in to the truck and stolen a six pack of Griffon beer. So we went to this picnic table to apply tattoos and nails, and we see these two bugs. The man bug is totally trying to rape the chick bug, and it was intense. He wanted to copulate so bad...She wouldn't hear of it. Finally, he gets his little pointy wang into the chick bug's abdomen or whatever, and suddenly...There are three bugs. SHE FUCKING GAVE BIRTH TO A FUCKING BUG OF EQUAL OR COMPARABLE SIZE, RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR FUCKING EYES. It was retarded. Needless to say, we were freaked out. Kinsley was so freaked out, in fact, that she yelled, "CUNT!!" which made me fall to the ground and convulse with laughter and fear. So we moved on, and sat on this wooden thingy. There are bugs all around us, but we just brushed them off. So I'm looking around, and I glance down at Kinsley's shoes. Sure enough, there's a fucking caterpillar on the top of her shoe, like, ready to crawl in. In the calmest voice I can muster (so as not to alarm anyone) I say, "Kinsley, I don't want to freak you out, but there's a caterpillar in your shoe". Naturally, Kinsley freaks out. I tried to get the thing off, but my black woman nails were useless. Kinsley took off her shoe and shook it for a good ten seconds before it fell off. It was the second time that day that caterpillars attacked Kinsman. So we all decide to go to Subway. On the way there, Steph and Hailey were missing (again), and me and Kinsley were just walking, minding our own business. Suddenly, a van with two college-age guys drives by, and one the them scream out, "Nice glasses!" to Kinsley. Kinsley yells back, "Thanks!" very politely, and then (the van was quite far by now) they have the gall to yell back, "Bitch!". So I flipped them off with my ridiculously-long nail. And then I got tattoos.

      Yeah, so about an hour ago I got two new tattoos. I could make a Motley Crue reference right about now, but I won't becuase I don't like to polease Christine. They're stars on the inside of my ankles, just below the bone. I love them. I have named them Kass and Steph in honour of the hottest twins I know, one half of which was present when I got them. I want more. So that's about all I have to say for now....Christine, if you are reading this, what's up? Still coming to the mall with me tomorrow? That's it. Oh, and I'm moving to Turkey.

      All right. I know I don't have a whole lot to bitch about. I get to leave the continent for a year a be schooled at a first-rate institution at little cost to my family. The country I am moving to is warm and next to many a large body of water. The family I will be staying with seems very nice. HOWEVER. Yes, HOWEVER. GREEN DAY ARE GOING ON TOUR. THEY WILL BE STOPPING IN MONTREAL. THE BEASTIE BOYS ARE GOING ON TOUR. THEY ARE EXPECTED TO STOP IN MONTREAL. NOWHERE ON EITHER BANDS' ITINERARY DOES IT MENTION "ISTANBUL", "IZMIR", "TURKEY", OR ANYWHERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, FOR THAT MATTER. What the frig. Two out of my three favourite bands are coming to my hometown while I will be away. On a different continent. FRIG. If I find out Radiohead are touring, that's it. I put the kaibosh on this whole trip. Unless the Beastie Boys suddenly decide to put on some kind of "To the 5 Boroughs of Mecca" tour. I wouldn't put it past them. Didn't they all become Buddhists like, three years ago?

      I am both shocked and appalled by the ignorance that exists today in our society. Today, this very day, I had the extreme misfortune to venture out to the videostore to rent a movie. A mundane task, it would seem. As soon as I entered the local video shop, I fell uneasy. I had an immediate sense of dislike for the two butter trolls behind the counter. They were not jovial, like the former staff. Oh no, these two sat there with sour looks of their faces, scrutinizing all who entered. I wandered around, looking to see if they had the movie I wanted on DVD. To my dismay, I realized they did not. So I wandered into the VHS section. I found what I was looking for. From the counter, I heard a terrible voice screeching at me. "What are you looking for?!" Not used to this sort of treatment, I stuttered before answering. "Uh...I...I was just looking for the Pauly Shore section. I found it though." The butter troll who spoke turned to the silent butter troll. They exchanged a glance. "Do we even have a  Pauly Shore  section?" The talking butter troll said his name with such contempt I thought Pauly Shore would Shore-ly fall down dead wherever he was. "Uh...Yeah, yes, you do have a Pauly Shore section. I just found it. Thanks." I picked out my desired movie...The classic film  Bio-Dome.  I made my way to the counter, the swishing of my skirt the only noise resonating through the store. I placed my video on the counter and the talking butter troll my phone number. She looked at the screen, then back at me. With an almost triumphant voice, she declared, "You have a fine." Of course,  I  didn't have a fine. My brother, in his infinite laze, had neglected to walk to the twenty feet to the video store to return his game on time. God has already punished him with his looks. The talking butter troll consulted her mute counterpart. "If this fine&nbsp;was for a game, why is it $8.76 instead of $4.38?" The mute spoke: "Well, it was a day and a half late, so I just charged him for two." If looks could kill, I would have slain both butter trolls on the spot. Luckily, my brother's account is the only one with the fine,thus I&nbsp;was able to rent my movie. I placed it on the counter. Then it happened. "So, who is Pauly Shore?" The words struck me like a car strikes a jay-walking pedestrian. I couldn't even find an answer. The one who spoke turned to the silent one. "Do you know who he is?" she asked. The mute one shook her head. "He...He's one of the greatest actors of out time. He's a comedic legend", I said. The talking butter troll rolled her eyes and charged me for the movie. I left, fighting back tears. In light of what happened, all I have to say is this: We need Seb back. Seb ruled that video store with an iron fist. An iron fist of good taste. He knew the components of a good video store clerk. And he possessed them.&nbsp;If I walk into the video store and ask for "that movie where John Cusack hold the boombox", I want to hear, " Say Anything ", not, "WHO THE HELL IS PAULY SHORE". Seb, on behalf of all patrons of&nbsp;Mega-Video Dorval, please, swoop down and grace us with your devine presence. Please.   I met Pauly Shore yesterday. It was magical. &nbsp;

      Tonight I went to Foufs and now I am drunk, but I am being careful with my writing. I threw up in the bathroom, and they didn't catch me, so i went back to the table and said "I fought the law and the law didn't win becuase I threw up on my trendwhore shoes". I forgot about it, Julia and Lauren reminded me. And then I danced to 99 Red Ballons and 8 Days&nbsp;a Week. It was fun, and then I got onto the stage and danced but I was a bit worried i was going to fall off. Now I think I need to go to bed because this is only my second time being drunk, so I should sleep the fucker off.

      Yesterday I went to Bromont (which, despite its deceptive French name is in the Eastern Townships) and bought VESUVIUS. VESUVIUS is this awesome Greek statue thing whose name deserves to be capitalized. She is half lying down, topless, with her bottom half covered by some sort of toga. I named her myself. At first, I was going to name her Souvlaki Face, but I like VESUVIUS better. Then me and Christine kept making my mom cry by saying things like&nbsp;'Turkey' and 'a year abroad'. It was awesome. It got to the point where I would get up to go to the bathroom, and I would be like, 'see you later, mom' and she would cry. I think she's going to adopt Christine. Oh, that reminds me, while I'm diligently writing in my Seb blog, not caring about the time or how frigging tired I am, you ask yourselves 'where's Christine?' Well, she's upstairs, sleeping. Just goes to show you how much SHE cares about Seb. And her stupid bird keeps making stupid bird noises and I have no problem shoving the fucker in the oven.

      I hoped it would not come to this. Christine has not only taken out her metaphorical glove, but she has taken this metaphorical glove and slapped me with it, metaphorically, and challenged yours truly to a duel. Do I accept? Of course. Not only do I accept, but I laugh at her metaphorical duel. You see, Christine started her blog quite recently, when my blog was clearly started RIGHT AFTER it was&nbsp;suggested by Seb. I did not take my SWEET ASS TIME like some people, and yes, there were times where I did not update on a regular basis, but it was only because I was busy saving babies and blind/deaf lepers AND thinking of new ways to honour Seb, so&nbsp;needless to say I was busy. And since I declared myself president BEFORE Christine kicked me out of my own club, I hereby reinstate myself. How you like dem apples, bitch? And by apples, I clearly mean bureaucracy.

      Today is the one year anniversary of the birth of my blog, which means it's also the one year anniversary of the first and subsequently last meeting of the Seb Fan Club. What is happening these days with the Seb Fan Club, you might ask? Well, seeing as it seems to have disbanded, I have hereby declared myself the treasurer, secretary, vice-president and president of the Seb Fan Club. I will take on all responsabilities in affairs regarding the Seb Fan Club, which, for the past year, has basically consisted of doing nothing. Any monies intended for the Seb Fan Club and it's members can be sent directly to me, and I will make sure that they are distributed to the right people (me). In other news, this is a special shout-out to my number one boy*, Jon "They Have Brakes, You Know" Milukow. Word. &nbsp; &nbsp; *Don't worry, Alec. You are my number one Scotsman.

      So we found Hans. It took almost a year, but we found him. Everything seems fine, right? Me and Christine just email him and get our million backstage passes for Warped, like last year? Well, my peeps, the plot thickens. You see, our dear friend Hans has been living a lie. A dangerious lie, one that would haunt all those who meet him for the rest of their lives. Well, it haunts me and Christine. Hans is not Hans. His name, it is not Hans. It's Andrew. He's got a regular first and last name, not just "Hans the Guitar Guy Who May or May Not Work for A German Band That May Or May Not Use Umlauts On One Of The Letters In Their Name". So did Christine and I email our mysterious benefactor? No, not yet. We're still too shaken up over our recent discovery. Jeez. It will take time to heal these wounds that were maliciously opened by the Guitar Tech Formrely Known As Hans. Time will heal all...Or so we hope.  Me and Christine are going shopping Saturday! w00t!!

      TV blows. Except for when they play 80s specials. Those are special times. Two more full days of watching the dogs. I'm getting a little concerned, because they smell a little bad and I'm wondering if they smelled a little bad when I got here. Hahaha they just called Fahrenheit 9/11 "incendiary". "Hey, I'm incindiary too!"

      So bored. So very bored. Last night I watched the new Chris Rock special, and I tried not to laugh for the entire thing. There was only one part where I laughed out loud...He was talking about how fucked up everyone is now and used examples like Michael Jackson and R. Kelly... He mentioned how even tigers were affected, refering to the tiger that attacked Sigfried or Roy or whoever the Hell it was. "Everyone's getting mad at the tiger, saying the tiger went crazy. The tiger didn't go crazy, the tiger went  tiger . The tiger was crazy when he was riding around on a bike wearing a hat". Man, it was funny. Tigers are the new sharks. Trying desperately to organize a trip to NYC, not having a lot of success. I got to speak to someone from New York when I called Amtrack, though. That was nice. I nees something good to read, I'm dog-sitting for another four and a half days, at least. I think I also need a shower. I think I also need Christine to quit harassing me about my blog and permenantly add me to her sidebar list. No, actually, I need a little Tenacious D.

      Okay, so the official Turkey Countdown has begun. There is exactly one week before I leave the comfort of Canada for the war-torn sandy landscapes of the Middle East. Just kidding. It's only Turkey. I think I should start to pack soon. My room is covered in clothing. I also have to do a little shopping...I want slide-on leopard print shoes from Old Navy, a new skirt that I saw at Sears, some perfume, and some reading materials for the flight. There was a surprise going-away party for me. It as neat. Jon Milukow was there, which blew my frigging mind. Christine and Diana were there too. Christine smashed chips on my head. I guess it's better than an egg. She also put chips in my pillow, which really pissed me off at 3 in the morning when I wanted to go to bed SO bad, and I was pulling Ruffles out of my pillowcase. I went to Alec's house on Thursday, and his sister took a tube of toothpaste, put it on the floor of her room, and jumped on it. Toothpaste came out of both ends, and went all up her wall. Then she went and got an egg and dropped it in the toothpaste from various heights until it finally cracked. Then we sat there and drew pictures with toothpaste and egg. It was fun. She said she's going to leave the toothpaste on her wall and send me pictures of it in Turkey. I am excited.

      ATTENTION:  THE VILLAGE  SPOILERS AHEAD  All right, so Alec's mom got free passes to go see a movie. Alec and I decide to go see  The Village.  I, being the cunning devil I am, already knew what was going to go down, but I figured, 1) Joaquin Phoenix is in it and 2)  The Village  >  A Cinderella Story .  We moseyed over to the cinema at about 9:30. Our movie started at 9:50. We decide to get some drinks and popcorn. Both Alec and I order 7-Up. The cashier gives us our concessions and we go on our way. I was a bit thirsty, so I decided to have a sip of the 7-Up. Little did I know, there was a mystery lurking in the cup. IT WAS NOT 7-UP, IT WAS CLUB FRIGGING SODA. Now, the only time I have  ever  heard of  anyone  actually drinking club soda was while my mom was pregnant with my sister. She had a frigging person inside of her and was probably not thinking too clear, thus it is justified. The real question here is,  "Who  actually  drinks club soda on a regular basis? And are they drinking so much club soda that it is absolutely necessary for it to have it's own spot on the soft drink fountain?"  The Soda Incident should have been my number one indication that I should abort mission, but I ventured on. The movie started, and we were taken away to a whimsical land where "blind" girls can run freely through thick forests without walking sticks and people will try to escape from a locked room by first prying up the floorboards and  then  trying the open first-floor window. It was a land where instead of grief counselling to get over the loss of their loved ones, people decide it's better to start their own 19th century village. It was a land where the smallest movement in the forest is seen by the 24-hour lookout and immediately reoprted, however a retard wearing a bright red costume who escapes to the forest during the day goes unnoticed. My peeps, it is  The Village.  There were many terrible quotes throughout the movie, however there are several that stand out as incredibly terrible. There are also many different kinds of terrible quotes. There are the terrible quotes that are used to desperately tie together a weak plot and gaps in the story, such as,  "Oh, no! He has found our costume we keep under the floorboards! And he has escaped!"  There are terrible sporadic quotes that are supposed to be some sort of foreshadowing, but which don't, such as,  "My oldest sister didn't live past 23" , which was randomly said at a wedding, might I add. Then there are the terrible quotes that are used to make up for the fact that the blind girl always seems to know where she's going (without any help) and exactly where Joaquin Phoenix is at all times, such as,  " I can see  a colour around you, Lucius. I can't tell you what colour it is, but you have a colour around you".  You will notice I highlighted "I can see". No you can't. You're fucking blind. Frig, I could play a better blind chick than her. Maybe it was the director's fault, or maybe she just didn't understand when they said, "All right, for your character, pretend that you don't see shit." If I was a movie critic, I would kill myself. But first, I would give this move a 2/10. It only gets a 2 for the liberal use of Joaquin Phoenix's hot body.
