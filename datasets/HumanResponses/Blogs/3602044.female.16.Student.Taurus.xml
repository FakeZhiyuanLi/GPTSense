       I have figured out that weekends in the summer suck ass.  Well let me start by telling you about my last horrible ordeal.  Last weeknd my mom and I went to Wyoming to see out family.  Well that was all fine and wonderful, except everyone is fighting with each other due to the fact that they cannot figure out what to do with my grandma.  They ended up taking her to the hostpital...strike 1...We took 2 horses down there to sell and only sold one...strike 2...The trailer lost it's brakes and marker lights before we even started home...strike 3...They tried to fix the trailer, which didn't work, so my mom decided we could just come home anyway (this was at 2 p.m.) it's an eight hour drive...strike 4...The trip was going good, until we were coming out of Gillette and HIT A DEER!!...strike 5...So pretty much the entire weekend was an entire BUST!!!!  So for all of you who love summers out there....What's the deal, this is my summer right now...sleep, work, sleep, work, have 3 days off where i sleep more and don't really do anything, then start the whole cycle over again.  At least I get to see people during school.  Well I guess that's all I have to ramble about right now, so everyone have a wonderful fricken day.

       Ok now I will admit that I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series.  I know what you're thinking, that's gay, how can any self respecting teenager like something that, well juvenile?  And the answer is this....I don't know....When they first came out I thought that they were really stupid looking and that the books were "gay" but upon closer realization(like my friend dragging me to the theatre to see the 2nd one) I have come to the conclusion that they really are just testimonial of the trails and triumph of the human spirit set to a fantasy theme.  The books are excellently written and make you think that you are in a world where muscles, Quidditch, and Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardrey really exists.  Last night I went into the theatre to see the 3rd installment of the series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and let me say this, I don't believe that it could have been made any better.  Now I do realize that they had to cut a bunch of things out to be able to meet time constraints, but the way they tied everything together, they really did hit all the important parts of the book.  Well there were some exceptions, but we won't get into that.  All in all I believe that for all you people out there who doubt the Harry Potter series, take a closer look, look past the magic and make believe, so you can see what the series true meaning is.  Maybe if you do look into this world you will come out with a new outlook on the REAL world.

       Well let me see, it all started this morning when I was sitting on the couch, minding my own damn business and watching the Funeral of President Ragean.  Which I think is great because he was one of the greatest people of our time.  When Someone who will remain namless came into the room and preceeded to be very rude and impatient about going out and flushing irrigation pipe.  Now here's my thought:  It's raining, cloudy, and generally not the weather to be turning water on anyway, so WHY THE HELL THE BIG RUSH???  And what really pisses me off is that my favorite person was about to give a eulogy and I really wanted to watch it.  So then we go out to the field and my mom and I are checking gates and doing some other stuff and he is there being a total dick the whole time, telling her what to do and that everything she does is wrong, so then it really really made me angry.  So I said Fuck It! I won't even give him the satisfaction of pissin me off, I'll just ignore him, and let me tell you what, it's working.  So this rambling is to the one who pisses me off the most often and with great success evertime.  So here's to him, at least I had something to write about.

       If any of you out there ever get the chance to help anyone with irrigation pipe...DONT!!!&nbsp; it is a dangerous ploy to hurt innocent people.&nbsp; Take my story:&nbsp; We were putting out irrigation pipe last friday when i was struck in the back of the leg by the tire of the pipe trailer.&nbsp; Well the tire grabbed my leg and wouldn't let go, in which it bent my foot pretty much around the tire, backwards.&nbsp; Well ya see I excercised some restraint...and didn't cuss, seriously, all i said was ouch crap.&nbsp; Then my mom remover my shoe and cut off my sock, by then the foot was starting to swell, they took me to the emergency room in sturgis, the guy nurse was hot....neway, they told me that it wasn't broken, just that i pulled everything in the top of my foot, well shit, there goes my summer, and my volleyball season.&nbsp;
