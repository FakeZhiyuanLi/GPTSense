						   Over the weekend, I thought of several things I could write, but now that I am online to do it, I can't think of anything.  My weekend wasn't every exciting.  On Saturday, I went over to my friend's house to watch the latest episode of Enterprise.  There's only one episode left and it looks to be really exciting.  Of course, if you haven't been watching the rest of the season, it might be difficult to understand.  There has been a major storyline over-arching the whole season.  I have to admit that one reason I keep watching the show is because I find Jolene Blalock (T'Pol) so attractive.  In my opinion she's the best reason to watch.  I like Star Trek anyway, so I would probably still watch it without her.  If you are interested in more infomation online, visit  urlLink the official Star Trek website .

						   Another day has passed and I don't have much to write about.  I'm just trying to get by until I start working on campus in June.  I'll be working at the  urlLink Microelectronics Research and Communications (MRC) Institute  in the Evolutionary Computation Lab.  I don't really know what I'll be doing, but from their website, it looks rather interesting.  Hopefully, I'll gain some good experience that will help my future career as a computer programmer.

						   Last night I was invited to join some friends for a Halo party.  They had three televisions with three Xboxes networked together for a massive multiplayer experience.  I'm not all that good, but neither were most of the other players.  I had a great time sniping Scorpion drivers and running over people with a Ghost.  We must have played for six hours.  It was great!  That's about the most exciting thing that's happened so far this week.

						   I might as well mention that I'm working on some projects at  urlLink SourceForge .  They are the  urlLink Swiss Tournament Software Project  and the  urlLink Staff Scheduling Project .  Visit the links for more details.

						   Well, I've never written a blog before, so I decided I might as well try something new.  I just finished a semester at University of Idaho and now I don't have much to do.  I've accepted a summer research position on campus, but it doesn't start until June 14.  Until then, I've got plenty of time on my hands.  I've set a goal to get my Sun Certified Java Programmer certification by the end of the summer, so I'm using the extra free time to refresh myself on some Java programming stuff.  I'm fairly confident that I can pass, but that isn't enough for me.  I can't waste the two hundred dollars it takes to sign up for the exam.  Well, that's enough for now.  If anyone reads this, I hope you have a great summer.

						   I had a great weekend.  I went rafting on the Salmon river with some friends.  It was a lot of fun.  We went on the stretch of the river just above Riggins, ID.  The water was high and there were some great rapids.  We had our own rafts, so we didn't go with any of the professional outfitters.  (It's a lot cheapter that way.)  For the first half of the ride, I was on a two-person inflatable canoe ("the Tahiti").  I don't think my partner and I hit all the rapids perfect, but we still had a great time.  We stopped for lunch shortly after one of the biggest rapids:  Time Zone.  My friends Cory and Justin wanted to use the Tahiti, which I was a little unwilling to give up.  Eventually I gave in, though, and rode on one of the larger rafts.  Interestingly, they tipped the Tahiti over in the next rapid.  According to Cory, he was pulled underwater for quite a long time.  Suddenly he started doing somersaults, and the water ripped his pants off.  Fortunately, he made it out alive, even if he didn't have all his clothes.  Justin continued through the next rapid on his own and flipped the Tahiti again.  Once he caught up to the raft I was riding in, I jumped in with him and we made it through the next rapid just fine.  However, the raft I just left hit one of the rapids just the right way to throw half of the riders overboard.  The raft didn't tip over at all;  it just bucked out most of the people in it.  The rest of the trip wasn't nearly as exciting as all that.  The rapids were great, but no one else tipped over.  We teased Cory all the way.  Fortunately, one of the girls with us had an extra pair of shorts that fit him in one of the vehicles.

						   This job is turning out to be a little more than I bargained for.  However, I'm enjoying it anyway!  I'm definitely learning a lot about genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, neural networks, and other loosely related topics.  I've also met this incredibly cute girl.  She's in the REU program, too.  I feel like I'm going crazy because I just can't get her out of my mind.  Unfortunately, there are only two women in the program, along with like 14 guys, so the girls get a lot of attention.  I just wish I knew what to do to attract this one.  I invited her to come down to Lewiston this last weekend to hang out with me, but she declined.  I'm not sure if that means that she already made plans with someone else or what?  I'm not very experienced with this dating game, so I don't know what to do.  And the emotions I'm feeling are just so overwhelming.  How does anyone deal with this?  I just can't seem to function since I am so preoccupied with such a mixture of confusing thoughts and feelings.  No matter what happens, I guess life will go on.  So I guess I'll just have to keep going.

						   It's been a while since my last entry.  I've been busing getting started at my new job with  urlLink MRCI .  I'm learning a lot about evolutionary computation.  In particular, I'm working on a basic genetic algorithm (GA) program.  Eventually, I hope to start exploring new territory where no one else has been.  I am helping a graduate student, Matt Settles, with a project on neural networks.  My part of the project is writing a program that evolves a neural network by adding.  I'll be using an algorithm that is a hybrid between a traditional genetic algorithm and something called "particle swarm optimization" (PSO).  I still need to figure out the details of the later half.  After I'm done playing around with my basic GA program, I'll start working on a PSO version.  That's it for now.  I've got to get back to work.

						   Wow what a busy week!  I've been coding a lot even though my job hasn't started yet.  I am a registered member at  urlLink Top Coder  and have participated in their competitions since they were founded in 2001.  In fact, I helped with the beta testing for what is now called the Algorithm Competition.  Currently, I am working on components for their Development Competition, which started a little more recently.  Last week, I spend a lot of time working on the  urlLink Javadoc Verification component .  This week I'm starting on the  urlLink SQL Parser component .  It sure takes a large amount of time, but I'm certainly learning a lot about Java and other programming technologies.  Hopefully I'll even win some of the prize money.  If you are interested in joining TopCoder, just visit the site and click on the Register link in the upper right-hand corner.  When you reach the fields about Referals, select "member referral" and enter "Code-Guru" (that's me!) as the member's handle.  It's a great coding experience and also a way to earn some extra cash.  I'm also trying to work on my  urlLink  Staff Scheduler  project.  Apparently there is some growing interest in this software.  I've recieved several posts on the public forum inquiring about the status of the project.  Now I need to make more time for this project as well as continue with the TopCoder component projects.  It looks to be a busy week, and then I start the REU position with MRCI next week.  I'll have more details about that as I learn what's going on.  So stay tuned!
