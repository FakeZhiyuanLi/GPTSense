      Here is a copy and paste from Yahoo! Weather.... Please read may apply to you This does apply to me, my Husband lives in Jacksonville, Florida. We're sort of scared...   Hurricane Charley hits US coast after battering Cuba    12 minutes ago   MIAMI (AFP) - Hurricane Charley, packing 145 mile (235 kilometer) an hour winds, hit the Florida coast amid fears that it could submerge large areas with a wall of water.  Hundreds of thousands of people were told to leave their homes but the "mandatory evacuation order" was widely ignored, heightening fears as the hurricane gathered strength.  The most powerful storm to hit Florida in more than a decade crossed the coast at Sanibel, just north of the major city of Fort Myers on the west coast.  Earlier, Hurricane Charley battered Cuba for more than two hours tearing roofs off houses, ripping up trees and cutting power but no fatal victims were reported.  Scores of civial aviation flights and train services were cancelled because of the storm and the US navy sent many of its ships out to see from Florida bases.  Fort Myers mayor Jim Humphrey appealed to people still in the city to stay in their homes and put up the best protection possible.  "It's blowing pretty good and the house is shaking and rocking," Sanibel resident Bill Kirkland told the local CBS television station. "A lot of trees are down, we've lost power and we have a generator going," he added.  The eye of the storm also passed over Port Charlotte, north of Fort Myers, which has been prone to flooding in the past. Resident Janeen Stenso and her family barricaded themselves in their house using styrofoam, furniture and plywood.  John Bryant took shelter in nearby Punta Corda in a local church hall. "We are really getting a pounding," he told CBS.  "We have tornados interspersed with all this wind. We can see debris flying all around. They just told me that the shingle roof is coming off."  The US National Hurricane Center ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) warned of storm surge flooding of up to 13 feet (3.9 meters) along the coast, with potential flash floods and mudslides.  "It could be very life threatening," said Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in western Miami-Dade County.  Some 10,000 people lost power in the Miami area, while the Walt Disney theme parks in the inland resort of Orlando, which was in the hurricanes path, all closed down.  Evacuation orders extended up Florida's Gulf Coast to Tampa Bay, as Charley was predicted to strike cities as far north as Tampa and Jacksonville.  Authorities opened up schools and other public buildings to act as emergency shelters, but many people ignored the evacuation order or did not think about leaving until it was too late.  In the small coastal town of Cedar Key, police chief Dan Swogger said: "The majority of people I've talked to have made it clear they're not going to be going."  Some 215,000 residents and 2,000 tourists were evacuated from high-risk areas in western Cuba before the storm passed the island.  In Havana, authorities set up shelters with food and doctors, and had shut off electricity as a precaution. Violent winds battered the Cuban capital, damaging buildings and bringing down power and telephone cables.  Cuba's national meteorology institute said there had been flooding in parts of the south coast provinces of Havana and Matanzas after waves of up to five meters (16.5 feet) were whipped up by the storm.  Hurricane Charley missed Jamaica on Thursday but came close to the Cayman Islands, the small British colony, forcing the closure of its main airport for a while.  Charley came on the heels of Tropical Storm Bonnie, which hit Florida with heavy rains on Thursday.  Florida residents rushed to buy plywood to board up the windows of homes, restaurants and stores.  The weather forced oil companies to cut production by about 420,000 barrels on Wednesday, equal to one-quarter of the total production from the Gulf of Mexico, the Department of Interior said.  The hurricane also forced ChevronTexaco, BP, Shell and other companies to continue evacuating oil and gas platforms in the central and eastern Gulf on Thursday.
