        Today was just your typical Friday. I woke up in the morning and did as I always did. Then, when I got to school, I hung out with Ana, Katie, and Josh at "the table" as we called it last year, but this year it is a different table, so I am  not sure if it is called "the table" this year. Then I went to first period (resource) and I didn't really dod anything in there, but do a page in my workbook and write about 8 words in my journal. I wrote "If I were and animal I would want to be a kitty-cat because. That is all I could finish because the bell was about to ring and all the people around me were bothering me by talking to me. I think me and Jacob are getting closer and closer. I think it is really cool that he is gay. I think it is cool to know a gay guy. Gay people are cool. I just have to be careful about what I say and stuff, cuz I might say something stupid or something like that and then I might hurt his feelings and he might not want to be friends anymore. He finally told his dad about the car accident. He said that his dad wasn't that mad, but he just wanted to see the tickets. Then I went to second period and I slept through most of it, but I woke up at the last like 20 minutes. We watched a movie called Dante's Peak. Then I went to lunch and hung out with Katie. During second period I had wrote this guy, Scotty, who gave me a ride to Popeyes the day before, a note, and I gave it to him, but I didn't tell him it was from me. When I gave it to him, I said " one of my friends wanted me to give this to you." And he turned it upside down and then back around and then said "ok." And I walked away laughing. Then I went to science and took my science test, which I didn't finish, but I get to finish it Tuesday during resource. I also got a 100 back. I was so excited because the is the highest grade that I have gotten back in that class, ofcourse....it is the highest grade that you can make period, but anyways. Then I went to English, where I came here to write in you. And that is how my day went...so far. I don't know how it is going to go after I get home. Oh yeah....I stopped to Devon for a while, I mean, I didn't call him, he didn't call me, I didn't go over to his house, he didnt' come over to mine, and then I ran into him on my way to second period. He was behind me saying my name. And then he came up beside me and I was like "hey", like I hadn't been ignoring him or anything and I gave him a hug and he was like "what are you doing" and I said "give you a hug" and he hugged me back. And then this girl named Ariel, who is supposedly my "friend" came up and kissed him right in front of me and 3 times at that and he kissed her back!!!!! Right in front of me and she is suppose to be my friend. That makes me so mad!!! I could have about killed her. I didn't even know that she liked Devon. But I guess I know now. And I guess that he likes her too otherwise he wouldn't have kissed her back, but that is ok, I don't need him, I have other guys!!!! Buh bye

        Today was on OK day. Besides the fact that it rained like all day, so I couldn't go out on courtyard in the morning or in the afternoon during lunch, but by the time the other lunches came around, it probably wasn't raining. I got in a big fight yesterday with Devon. He told me that if I came over to his house that he was going to whoop my behind, so I didn't go over to his house. I haven't seen him since. But the reason I didn't go over to his house is because it was raining all night and you can't go out in the rain. I meant to tell his brother, Courtland, that I really needed to talk to him and that I was sorry and that I was just playing around...becuase I was...he just has to understand that. Today during lunch my friend, Katie, got mad at me because I stole her brothers soda because he wouldn't stop making a rustling noise with the wraper to his honey bun, and she called us immature. Then later on, I threw a nickel at her, and her brother's friend Justin, blamed it on Peter (her brother), Peter blamed it on me, and I blamed it on Peter. So, Katie called us immature, told me to give me her bookbag and she got up and went to the library. So, like I went to the library like 5 minutes later and I said "as a friend, I thought that I should come after to see why you were mad." And she said "because ya'll were acting immature and I don't want to put up with it." and I asked her how we were acting immature and she told me that me stealing her brothers soda was immature and then me throwing the nickel was immature. I told her highschool is the last 4 years that we are going to remember and we are gonna want to have good memorys. We don't want to have no memorys or boring memorys. But anyways....I am going to be home alone tonight...which I hate. I hate being home alone because I get scared and I think that someone is in my house and all this other stuff, but I don't think my mom cares, but that is just how I feel. I hope me and Devon can work through our problems because I really still want to be friends with him....his is really kool and really sweet. When I got home from school, I went to Devon's house and I apologized to him and he told me not to worry about it, but he couldn't really have company that day because I guess it was cleaning day or something, so I went home after that.

        Today was another boring day at school. During lunch my friends were throwing pretzels and the starbursts that they didn't like...it was kinda funny...they almost hit someone. Then I saw someone that I hadn't seen since school got out for the summer. She waved, and I waved back...I barely recognized her...she looked really different. I woke up really tired this morning. I almost fell asleep in ROTC, but my acticg flight sargent slammed his hands on the desk and yelled "wake up!" and I was awake for the rest of the period. I decided that I am going to stay in ROTC because it is going to look good on my diploma. I got my uniform in that class. That boy on courtyard...I got the guts to go up to him today. I said "despite the fact that you might hate me and think I am crazy, my friend wants to know your name." and he said "Jason" and I said "ok." and I walked off. I felt so proud of myself. Justin got into trouble for eating in the lobby...it was funny, but Katie said that the guy that said you can't eat in the lobby was just kidding
