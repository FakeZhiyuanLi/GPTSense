      I'd like to thank three very good friends for being there for me through the, what I thought, was a disaterous time in my life, and making me realise that it wasn't as bad as I had magnified. This doesn't mean that I have forgiven anyone for making me feel the way I did, as far as I'm concerned, if they think of me the way they do, and they don't apologise, tell me I was wrong, blah blah etc., they can go screw themselves and get out of my life.  The two friends I'd like to thank are; Natalie, Jim and Kirsty. Thank-you so much for your help, loving care&nbsp;and wisdom. I'll never forget this, and I am in your debt.   Thank you   Paul

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Current mood: Depressed, incomplete, sad          &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current music: Maroon 5: Harder to Breathe     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yesterday, I made a realisation, I am incomplete. It makes me feel like shit. The incompletion; love. I am unloved. I know I'm repeating myself here (yesterday's entry) and I'm not gonna apologise for that.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday, as I was getting dressed after a shower, I looked myself in the mirror and asked myself "Am I happy living my life? Can I carry on? Do I need love to make my life complete?" And the answers were (In that order) "No, Yes and Yes". So, all you Einstein's out there should've figured out that I'm not happy living my life, I can carry on, and I DO need love in my life.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not happy living my life," yeah tha's true. Why? Because I am incomplete, that is the worst feeling I've had to date. And what makes it worse, is that I cannot express my true feelings to anyone, I'm one of those people who, if they were crying (example), the ONLY way somebody would be able to tell is by my tear stained face. What makes matters worse, is that I have nobody that will let me lean on their shoulder, because nobody in my life loves me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can carry on". But why? For my family? For my friends? "There's plenty of fish in the sea"? "There will be someone". No. None of those. I carry on, because I have the determination to prove everyone that makes me feel like shit wrong. I can become successful, I will become successful, and I will do it if it kills me.  "I DO need love in my life." Of course I do. Everyone does. It's a normal feeling. The only time I've not felt like this was when I thought "love is icky and so are girls", But that's normal for any 5 year old boy, I guess..  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would love nothing more than to have 1 person that would let me cry on their shoulder. I would love it more than anything in the world. I would love nothing more than to let someone cry to me and tell me why they are unhappy.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been told, by someone, "love stabs you in the back", so my first reaction would be "Then that's not real love", but then I heard "Love is a cold monster that traps you and won't let you go", and I put 2+2 together. Love is a backstabbing, monster that traps you and won't let you escape, but I'm at that time in my life, when I'm ready to take that chance and experience it for myself. As for other people... Nobody is ready to take me on, give me a chance, which makes me feel like shit.     &nbsp;  Well, Peace    &nbsp;  Paul ...

         Current mood: Confused, dazed.           &nbsp;     Current music: Some weird stuff on Kerrang Radio           &nbsp;   Today, I learnt something. I am incomplete. I thought&nbsp;I had everything, but I don't. (For one, where would I put it?) I also found out why I have that feeling, I need someone to love, I need somebody to love me. The thing is; Who? Most people, except my friends (Most of which male for the reasons I am about to explain), take 1 look at me and all of a sudden I'm breathing, living shit to them. Not the greatest feeling in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day, I was hangin out with a few friends, (who are skaters/rockers and stuff. I'm a kev/neutralist) and on my way home I was asked by a few kids (Couldn't have been older than 11-12) if I was one of them, if I worshipped the devil, and why I don't dress like that. Now, most people in that situation&nbsp;would've replied "No ,I don't worship the devil, No I'm not one of them, and I don't dress like that because I'm not one of them", but me... Ho no... Not me    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said to them "I was worse than them, I was the devil's child, and that I don't dress like they did because I'm in disguise working for the devil", and one of them held a cross to my face!!! So, I pushed him down, and the rest ran (bless em, lmao) and carried on walking. It wasn't the best feeling in the world either, this world is all about appearance.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All I ever wanted was to be loved, right from the very start, and all people wanted to do was hate me, run over me, shit like that. I'm not fucking standing for it anymore, it's the end of that shit.&nbsp; If people hate me from first glance, then I know that they're a shallow twat for thinking that. If they talk to me for a while, and they hate me, ok fair enough, we're not meant to be friends, I can dig that. Doesn't bother me in the least.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, back to my first point: Incompletion. Yeah, I feel incomplete, not much I, myself, can do about that, but other people... They can. I can think, right off the top of my head, right now, 3 people who have made me feel like that in the last month (Not gunna say who, I'm not that sad). But I don't care, if they're gunna be like that, after knowing me for nearly 3 years, not necessarily speaking to me for that period of time, but whatever, if they're gonna be like that, after making me think I was friends with them, fine. That's all I have to say on the subject.     &nbsp;   MSN username: I have everything I could want, except 1 thing; love. You do not know how that feels, I am alone.     &nbsp;   Well, that's the end for now,     &nbsp;   Paul ...
