      ^This^ is a prime example of why people who dont know jack about the internet/computers/etc should NOT BE ALLOWED anywhere near website hosting and design. Apart from the fact there is no design at all on this page. Its just a CRAP template provided by geocities. What a friggin waste of hyperspace! The website consists of just... wait for it... 53 words. And one picture. Which she didnt even upload herself Its one of those preuploaded pics, you can tell because geocities. use those "Corbis.com" pictures. Way to go. Note the quote on her friend "Charc's" site: "Thanks to Sarah for helping me with my links! :)" She couldnt even make the links herself, on a TEMPLATE! a TEMPLATE for goodness sakes! She didnt even have to copy the HTML code or anthing! This girl never even saw any HTML code. I bet she doesnt even know what it is. Pah. Webmasters the world round spend hours making the web a nice, sophisticated PHP and HTML orientated place, (like my website)... (plug plug) and then it gets polluted by this waste. Traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaashhh  You dont like what I just said? Bite me. Or post a comment. The choice is yours. Moowaha

      Well that was... crap.  I just sat my Advanced Higher Information Systems exam. It was crap. Again, typical because all of the exact things that I spent time revising on didnt come up. Not at all. Friggin typical. Talk about the estimate exam a couple of months back being misleading! I got an A on it. I have no idea what I'm gonna get for this monster.  I could swear the world is out to get me. On some kind of revenge trip for something I did? Its a massive consipracy. *looks around shiftily* Dont...trust...anyone...  Hopefully some junk food will help me get over it. Actually I think I'm over it already. Yea. The junk food does help. There you go folks, to get over a bad day or something annoying happening.... eat junk food! Yey! I feel better already.

      Typical! Aint it. Look at my profile, and I find out that I was born in "The year of the Dragon". Dude! Cool! Then I found out I put in my birth date wrong. Change it. Now i was born in "The year of the Rabbit". Woot.  Bloomin American style dates. Pah.

      Wow. A blog spot. I lived in fear of people who had these places before. All the creativity needed. All the imagination that goes into some peoples blogs, making for interesting reading, and here I am making one. What am I doing?  Getting on with life I suppose! ;)

      Exams are over at last! I thought they'd never end. Its higher, ya know. So called "the worst year in education" over! I am happy. I just hope my exam results will be something at all. If you know what I mean. Anyways...  Summer is here! The weather is FINE at the moment. I've actually been getting outside for some excersize! Amazing! Well, that isnt really hard to believe when you live in rainy old Aberdeen. It usually looks like  urlLink this   The fact that I just found that picture on a website whcih declares the name of a cemetary underneath the picture just makes it all the wierder. Bleh?  Goodbye munchkins.

      Well! Im home from holiday, In Orkney. The weather was fine, apparently a rarity there, so we were very lucky. One thing though... Orkney is full of suicidal maniac drivers!! All in a hurry to get nowhere, as Orkney is rather small. You have to laugh. We were greeted in the first 10 minutes by a near accident.  The cliffs and cliff stacks were fantastic, and I got a thourough use of my new 128Mb SD card for my digital camera ^_^  Saw "Nightmare on Elm Street" for the first time on holiday. Lol! What a typical 80s horror. I wouldnt exactly recommond it. I decided that in the film "Jason Vs Freddy"... Jason would definately win. =P
