      Although the relationship was short lived, I had a great date at La Vista.  We went to pick up some wine before and sat in the parking lot drinking while we waited. Although that doesn't sound all that romantic, its a cute tradition at La Vista. Friends of mine met there two years and I haven't been able to pry them apart since then.  The mood is very festive and the food is wonderful. If you need a good first date place La Vista is a great suggestion.

      Anonymous said...      Wow, this is great. I have something I have wanted to share with all the single men and women out there about my worst dating experience, but have never had a place to begin my tale.      When I turned 37, I was pretty determined to find the man for me and get married. One day out of nowhere, I recieved a call from a dating service telling me they wanted to survey my experience. I had previously responded to a personal ad I found in a publication I picked up at Cafe Artiste and thought they were referring to that. So I agreed to go in and talk to them.      It was actually Together Dating Service. I was put into a room and given a hard sale by one of their reps. I decided that since it was a goal of mine to be married, it might be worth the incredible sum of money to join.      The gist of their program is that you fill out a thing about yourself and what you are looking for in a mate so they can find you the perfect match. Sounded good to me. How substantial can a relationship be if it is founded only on physical attraction? Doesn't this process help you get to the chase?      Well first of all, I quickly discovered that there were no qualifications for the people making matches. As a matter of fact, I don't even think they read my profile. It said, clear as day that I'm an atheist. They set me up with several born again Christian men. I had also indicated that I didn't want to date anyone outside the beltway and that I preferred meeting people close to where I lived or out towards the galleria. I guess they thought Conroe, Katy and Pasadena fit in that area.      All told, I went out with 23 men. By about number 19, I was screening them myself over the phone before even agreeing to meet them in person. They were sending me 2 and 3 intros a week. I was discovering that very few women were in this organization. While I was getting 2 - 3 intros a week, these guys are getting 1 - 2 intros a month. There was a lot of pressure on them to make something click since the opportunities were so few and far between.      Bottom line is I was absolutely miserable. I am so angry by the lack of care and respect they held for their patrons. It is a money scam from day one.      If anyone wants to join a dating service such as Together, DO NOT FOCUS ON THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS in their membership. That is what they want you to see. YOU GET THEM TO SHOW YOU IN WRITING WHAT THEIR SUCCESS RATE IS IN CREATING SUCCESSFUL MATCHES. Because I promise you, you mix enough men and women together, you're going to get some matches. But they gave me the impression that they did more than just throw people together.      It isn't worth the investment.

      Hello,  This blog is for singles in the thirty plus age group.  My friend Cynthia has a blog and it's kinda fun to see what's going on in her life.  I thought that this would be a good forum to tell the good and the bad of dating.    The following questions are examples of what I feel might be helpful to other daters.  Where's a good place for a first date?  What are your dating nightmare stories?  Do you have good ideas for meeting new and fun people?  Do you use an online service?  What are the best ones?  Do you have any tips as to the best way to fill out the online profiles?  How do you transition from the cyberworld, to the real world?  There are probably others I haven't thought of.  I'd like to add links, but I am waiting to get feedback from others before adding them.  Thanks for taking the time to read my blog, I look forward to hearing your thoughts!  Angie

      In a comment to my last post somebody asked why would I want to get dates from the internet instead of traditional ways of meeting people.  He wasn't asking in a judgy kind of way, he's done it too, but it really is a good question.  The first reason that I use the internet is that I am busy.  I am a struggling realtor just trying to get as much business as possible.  Sometimes I am not home until late and don't want to go out.  With a traditional job you can go to happy hour, but that is not often in the cards for me.    The next reason is something that may be difficult to understand.  I am an extremely social person.  I have friends all over this town and am invited to really cool events.  You're probably thinking well what's the problem?  I think that the problem with that is I am so unapproachable when I'm out and about because I'm always engaged in conversation with some friend I haven't seen in a while.   Finally, I just can't get into that meat market groove.  When I see somebody that I'd like to meet, I am too shy to approach.  When somebody starts talking to me, I am often clueless to the fact that they would like to get to know me.    I am a very nice person, but sometimes appear to be aloof to new people.  I think that an internet date gets alot of that out of the way.  It's like I'd like to meet somebody, you'd like to meet somebody, so we are here to see if we click.    What do you think?

      I don't know if anyone reads this, but I just thought I'd share.  I am going out for dinner and drinks with another fine gentleman I've met on the internet.  I think he's a nice guy, but I'm not sure we click.  I'm going out with him anyway because my friends tell me I don't give people enough of a chance.  So, I'm not too sure about this guy.  I guess if the date turns out well, I can never show him my blog.  hee! hee!  I have had some very sweet comments on my last dating disaster.  I know nice guys are out there!  I even think that the guy I'm going out with tonight is nice.  We'll see what happens.

      I just read Monica's response to Bill Clinton's new book "My Life".  She is upset about the way that Clinton described their affair.  She then told the British Press that "Clinton's book made her feel "like an insignificant piece of dirt." Well when you are having an affair with a married man, you often feel like a piece of dirt.    Maybe the new publicity will give her a forum, but a forum for what, whining?  Read for yourself and see what you think.  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5295636/?GT1=3584  I try not to be judgmental.  I know that people make mistakes, and that although an affair is a bad thing to do, it does not make you a horrible person.  Bill Clinton did not "ruin" Monica's life.  Monica was not forced into the affair.  Any account of this affair will not show Ms. Lewinsky's good qualities.  In her defense, an affair with a man that powerful might be difficult to resist.    I hope that this ugly wrinkle in our history one day goes away, but in the meantime, take responsibility.  Say I did a bad thing and then "Suck it up"  Oh, I guess she already did!!!

      This past weekend, I just didn't have the energy to go through another internet match up.  I had discussed meeting one gentleman, I just had to put it off.  Too many bad dates in a row.  I just needed a break.  No pushy guys, no whiny guys.  I just needed to hang out with my friends!  I am not saying that I'm discouraged, or don't want to do this anymore, but just needed to back away.  This internet thing can be fun, but I think I might need to take a step back.  My friend told me that I should do one of the more involved sites like E-Harmony.  I am considering that too!  I'm also trying to get out more and meet people the old fashioned way,in person.  Let's see how that works.

      I started chatting with a guy from one of the personals sites and we decided to meet.  We went to a bar, and hung out for a bit.  As time went by the hints that the night should end shall we say at breakfast increased.  Not that this is not flattering, but I got the impression that if he were with any female, she would be getting the same "offer."    This guy told me how if he didn't like the profiles that he read, he would sent them rude messages.  The reason he didn't like the profiles was that he felt that the women put in too many expectations.  I guess he couldn't measure up.  The rude messages would be like hey, you wanna get laid and stuff like that.  I knew at that time, his match made in heaven wasn't me.  I told him that I realized that he was a "sure thing" but that I'd have to pass.  Made up some stuff about hope to see you again, and bolted.     I don't know that there is a moral to this story, just that there are people out there that don't have them.  It's not that this guy made clear what he wanted, just that I didn't expect such a bottom feeder.    I am looking forward to a new and better experience.

      I found  urlLink this article  on CNN that gives some incite on how to watch out for bad online dating experiences. Something I learned while reading this article is, men lie about being in a relationship, and women mostly lie about their looks. Some online dating sites want to offer a certified, dated photo on your profile.

      Good date We were heading from West Houston to a friend's house in Galveston. Julie needed to pick up a computer from her friend. We seemed to spend time in the truck quite a bit. We liked the time spent traveling together. We would talk while she drove. I cannot drive, so it is a good thing she enjoyed being the one behind the wheel. it was a beautiful day. The drive was nice. When we got to the friend's house we decided to go for a day at the Aquarium Restaurant. We made it down to the front and waited inside the lobby for a while. We were sitting down on a couch. Julie laid her head on my shoulder and fell asleep. We got that "cute couple" look from just about every one who walked by. When we were seated, we got a table right by the window overlooking the sea. It was a breezy day with a bright sun shining high. I don't remember what we had, but it was good. I remember looking at the stingray (I think it was a stingray) swimming up the glass. I remember looking at Julie and wanting so much to love her. When we left the restaurant, we went to a couple of shops then we went to some one's house and hung out for a while. Julie and I broke up a couple of years ago. When I think of Julie, I remember her smile that day.

      Slug boy got kicked to the curb again last night.&nbsp;  I had a semi-bad day and was going to skip swimming (maybe).&nbsp; Charles came over like 10 minutes after I got home without calling, empty handed except for the Sonic cup he was drinking (where the hell is mine).&nbsp; Aside from a hug and kiss when he came in (initiated by me of course), no other affection was shown and I really didn't know what the hell he was doing there.&nbsp;  He asked what I was doing and I said I had just got home and was watching&nbsp;Green Acres.&nbsp;&nbsp;Duh, I'm&nbsp;still in a suit and the TV is on.&nbsp; He didn't say anything else so I went back to the couch and he followed, sitting a few feet away.  No hand holding, no kissing, nada.&nbsp; He would just ask every few minutes what I was doing.&nbsp; (Duh!!)  I finally asked why he was there and he said I had a bad day so he came over.&nbsp; (And????&nbsp; Did he offer a massage, going out to dinner, anything????).  I was bored.&nbsp; I definitely wasn't going to entertain him.&nbsp; Apparetnly that's what's expected.  He fell asleep.&nbsp; I got up and did laundry and the dishes. him snoring the whole time.&nbsp;  I finally went over, kicked him awake and told him he needed to go.   Haven't heard anything.&nbsp; definitely not calling him.&nbsp; Will he contact me?&nbsp; Do I care?  Let the wagering begin!

      Throughout the past couple of weeks, I've been pondering the question of what exactly is love -- does anyone know?   (I'm just talking about romantic love, not family or platonic love.)   Of course, the question arose because I'm dating someone new, but also things have been happening to people I know that contrast each other and have weird timings.   Two weeks ago, one friend that is in a rather idyllic relationship for the past two years (July 2002) with a real sweetheart mentioned not&nbsp;having a shiny bobble on her left hand.&nbsp; (Note: she wasn't complaining, just mentioning as part of another conversation.)&nbsp; These two really do seem "perfect" for each other.&nbsp; In the past two years, both have really grown as individuals and at the same time grown as a couple.&nbsp; Pretty awesome.&nbsp; Yet still a naked third finger.   The next day I went to lunch with a&nbsp;friend that has barely known&nbsp;her husband for two years.&nbsp; They met in February/March 2002, dated 6 months (he's a pilot, so has a weird travel schedule), he got sent to Kuwait for 6 months with the Army Reserves but 1/2 way through came back and they got married (October 2002).&nbsp; So in Feb/Mar 2003, about a year after they first met, her husband returned.   What a contrast.&nbsp; Not that one relationship is better or stronger than the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's just odd how two different relationships move at such drastically different paces.&nbsp; I hadn't thought about it before, but the timing of the two conversations made the timing differences stand out.   I would definitely say the love is there between&nbsp;both couples.&nbsp; But that takes me back to the question of what is love......   Background info on my neighbors -- they've been living together for a year.&nbsp; The guy in the relationship has been more the guiding force in the relationship.&nbsp; He was the one that wanted them to move in, he's been the one talking marriage and&nbsp;asking about different ring styles, etc.&nbsp; She defiantly reciprocates the emotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had know each other for years before the relationship developed and it seemed very strong.&nbsp;  Last week, she came by to tell me they were moving.&nbsp; The prior Sunday he confessed that he had been seeing someone else since February.&nbsp; She said he came home from work (a paramedic/fireman) kissed her and said he loved her and took a nap and when he got up told her it was over.&nbsp; He said he wanted it to work and that's why he wanted them to get a dog together (so they would be a family), but decided he would rather be on his own.  Damn.   When I went back to work I was e-mailing with a former co-worker who has been married for TWELVE years and has for kids (but seems like it's nothing to have that many kids, she seems like a kid herself), who said she's leaving her husband.&nbsp; He knows and they are still living together while she saves money to get her own place.&nbsp; Once she does, they'll each take two kids and keep trading off (she laughed too).&nbsp; The kids are like 10, 8, 5 and 2 (the 2 y.o. was after a tubal ligation).&nbsp; She said it had been coming on for 8 years.&nbsp; She loves him, but not in that way.&nbsp; That seemed like a tight relationship.&nbsp; I remember one time he came to pick her up at work and we were talking about him running off with someone famous (can't remember who) and he said he's rather keep his wife and wouldn't want to trade her for anyone else.&nbsp; He didn't say it in a sappy way, but a content, happy way.&nbsp; Every now and then they would do super sweet things for each other -- little gifts, flowers, etc. That made it seem like a really awesome relationship.&nbsp; And now it's ending.....   I guess there is no guarantees in the world.&nbsp; And feelings/emotions change.&nbsp; So what's the point?    In Steel Magnolias, when Shelby was talking about her illness she said "I'd&nbsp;rather have 15 minutes of wonderful than a whole lifetime of nothing special."&nbsp;  She's got a point there....   A former co-worker that was in her late 30s and not married had the attitude of "I'd rather never be married than be divorced."  She's got a point there.....

      I've got a future blog entry in my head, but no time to transcribe.&nbsp;  In the meantime, here's&nbsp;a song to get stuck in your head, as it has been in mine.&nbsp;   It'll be a little appetizer to the blog enrty.....     WHAT IS LOVE &nbsp;&nbsp;     CHORUS:    What is love    Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more    What is love    Yeah     &nbsp;Oh I don't know    why you're not fair    I give you my love    but you don't care    So what is right    and what is wrong    gimme a sign&nbsp;     &nbsp;   (chorus x2)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   uoh oh...    Oh I don't know    what can I do    what else can I say    it's up to you    I know we're one    just me and you    I can't go on&nbsp;     &nbsp;   (chorus x2)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   uoh oh..What is love    What is love    What is love    Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more     &nbsp;   Don't hurt me    Don't hurt me&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I want no other    No other love    This is your life    our time    When we are together    I need you forever     &nbsp;   Is it love&nbsp;     &nbsp;   (chorus x2)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   uoh oh..&nbsp;     &nbsp;   (chorus x2)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more     &nbsp;   Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more     &nbsp;   Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more     &nbsp;   Baby don't hurt me    Don't hurt me    no more     &nbsp;    what is love?!...  &nbsp;

      Howdy happy and adoring fans~  &nbsp;  I recently wrote a series of e-mails updating friends on my adventures going out with someone I met through 8 minute dating.&nbsp; The updates were quite long and one was rather risque. I would be more than happy to e-mail the entire text at your request, but in the interest of saving time, space and some electrons I'll just post the brief synopsis included at the beginning of each update:  &nbsp;  #1  "Anna Finally Goes on a Date"  The short version: Yea!  It was a good date. Not quite sure when it's going, but definitely worth pursuing. In fact, pursuit continued at lunch and will tonight also.....  &nbsp;  #2  "Anna Finally Goes on a Date AND is Actually Still Seeing Him a Week Later"&nbsp;  The short version:  I almost ditched him earlier in the week, but I didn't and am now starting to look forward to spending time with him.  &nbsp;  #3  "Anna Finally Goes on a Date and Yeah, He's Still Around Here Somewhere"  The short version:  I guess now he should be classified as a boyfriend. Whatever.  &nbsp;  I never got around to writing a #4, but in summary I'm kinda sick of the&nbsp;lazy-ass slug boy, but regular sex is nice so I may continue to keep him around.  &nbsp;  My future bitching on this site will probably revolve around this relationship, so please make yourself familiar with the situation....  &nbsp;  Wahoo!  Anna

      Ouch!&nbsp;&nbsp; My arm has finally been twisted enough to break into the world of bloggers.&nbsp; I don't see myself posting enough to maintain a fan base of happy, adoring fans but Angie has been kind enough to grant me priviledges here.  &nbsp;  Most of my posts will probably center around the trials and tribulations of dating someone new.&nbsp; I've been seeing him an entire month and in Annaville, that's about 3 weeks too long.&nbsp; But to make an attempt at keeping&nbsp;happy, adoring fans I'll keep him around a while longer to entertain y'all.  &nbsp;  Be prepared for the first three posts that will be made shortly.&nbsp; It's a cut and paste from some e-mails that went out regarding the first month with the aforementioned dude-de-jour.&nbsp;&nbsp; I blew a couple of people away with my candor in post #2, so I'll try to keep comments more PG in future posts.&nbsp; Must keep the fans happy and adoring......  &nbsp;  Wahoo!

      I was with a group of people last night debating whether or not the United States actually went to the moon.&nbsp; To be honest I never really thought about it.&nbsp; When asked if I thought we had ever gone to the moon, I, without hesitation replied that I believe we went to the moon.&nbsp; I am not naive, I know that many events in our history did not occur exactly the way that our history books said they did.&nbsp; I know that it really wasn't the tooth fairy that left money under my pillow.&nbsp; I don't think that our government, even if they wanted to, faked us out and staged the moon landing.  &nbsp;  This is a link to the article that refutes the hoax claims on the NASA website: urlLink http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/News/2001/News-MoonLanding.asp &nbsp;  I am only looking at one side of this issue today.&nbsp; Please let me know what you think!

      My friend sent me information about an upcoming singles event that I wanted to share with you.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There were 140 young adults--mostly singles, a handful of couples--from  all  over Houston at St. Cyrils Church on Monday night.&nbsp;   Won't you join us this week for the next episode of CAFE CATHOLICA?

You can call or email me if you plan to come so  we'll be looking out for you.&nbsp;   Mass begins at 6:30 and will be celebrated especially for us by Bishop  Joe  Vasquez.&nbsp;   7:00 Music and Food&nbsp;   7:30-9:00 Fr. Michael Barrett "Bachelors and Bachelorettes" - dating  and sex&nbsp;   If you'll be meeting us at St. Cyrils (10501 Westheimer Rd @ beltway  8),  I'm looking for someone willing to take 2-3 passengers back to the carpool  site at St. B's after the event.

      This question is just as annoying as "Why are you still single?" - if not more so.   Translation:  You've been dating your boyfriend for a while.  You talk about him a lot.  Shut up and make it official.   The big problem with this is that people ask the woman in the relationship.  If she doesn't have a ring on her finger, chances are that she doesn't know either!  I have been asked this question three times today.  Is it because I talked about my boyfriend or brought it up in any way?  No.  All three came from people I haven't talked to in a long time who wanted to make conversation.  I graciously referred all three of them to my boyfriend if they really want to know.  I should be used to it, after getting the question all the time, but I'm not.  At first, I thought it was a sign that someone cared and was interested in how I was doing.  Now, I feel a bit insulted when people ask.  I don't know why.  It must be my own fault; I have pictures of us together on my desk, many times I answer the "What did you do this weekend?" question with talk about what we did together.  Perhaps people think that having a boyfriend is all I have going on in my life.  On the other hand, between school, Toastmasters, and work, I know I don't give off that impression, either.    I wonder if he gets the question as often as I do.  Chances are, no.  Why do people ask this, when they clearly know the answer?  Any thoughts?  Thanks for letting me rant.

      I was watching  Live With Regis and Kelly  this morning and saw the new 1 million dollar winner.  What a great thing, but this define who he is?  No, but a statement he made on the show did.  He told Regis and Kelly that he has received many letters of encouragement during this process, and told about one in particular.  A girl wrote him and said that she was considering dropping out of high school, but something about his success on the show made her change her mind.  There is nothing sensational about this guy.  No headlines about him saving a baby from a burning building or other acts that are generally considered heroic, but something about him helped somebody choose the right path.  I don't think that this girl thinks that graduating from high school will ensure her fifteen minutes of fame like Jennings, but who he is, made her want the best for herself.    I know this isn't with the my normal blog theme, but I was inspired by this story and wanted to share.    Remember to be the good person you are, and good things can come from that.  I think that Jennings place on Jeopardy is not to win a million, that's just a bonus.  He is there to provide a good example, maybe just for that one person.

      I am currently in a training program for the Houston Marathon.  Yes, I am gearing up for the big event in January.  I wont be training alone.  I'm working with Houston Fit you can find them  urlLink here.    This seems to be a positive way to meet people.  I signed up this past weekend and they are taking registrations through next Saturday.   If nothing else, what a confidence builder.  At the end of this program I will be able to say that I can complete a marathon.  Cool!

      I just read the following and would like to know your take on this.   Dear Rachel, I am so tired of being asked why I’m still single! I am 42 years old, and would love to meet someone special. It’s hard enough for me not to get discouraged about dating without everyone asking me about it, as if there is some deep, dark secret to my plight. From my parents, to my co-workers, to my hairstylist, to my dentist, I am constantly asked this question. How can I answer without sounding annoyed, defensive, or depressed? (All of which I am actually feeling, by the way!)  — Bridget in New Hampshire  Dear Bridget, Ah, the eternally annoying question! It should be illegal in 50 states to ask that question, don’t you think? It ranks up there with asking a woman “When is the baby due?” when she’s not actually pregnant.   First of all, don’t assume that someone is asking “Why are you single?” because he or she is looking for your faults, but rather always tell yourself that the question is really meant to imply, “You’re so fantastic! I can’t believe a great guy hasn’t snapped you up yet!” Edit your perception of the question first.   Then you need to answer the question directly with this single sentence: “I just haven’t met the right person yet.” This is a complete sentence. There is no “because…” that trails off the end here. This is not the time to divulge all your issues, quirks, and broken romances.   No matter who asks you, and how annoyed you really are inside, remember to always make lemonade out of lemons. Instead of acting irritated, use this opportunity to probe whether the questioner has someone wonderful to introduce to you. You are speaking to someone who is likely to have a single brother, cousin, neighbor, college roommate, or co-worker, so you need to convey an upbeat, lovely impression of yourself. Who knows what may ensue during the course of a conversation about you being single?    This is my take on the whole thing.  I think you shouldn't "make lemonade out of lemons".  I think you should be real.  People who have no business asking that question ask it.  I've been asked at family gatherings in front of several people.  I agree you shouldn't have a fit because people ask you this, but it is a good idea to let them know that the questioning makes you feel bad.  Be nice, but be real.    What's your take?

       6 billion people are on Earth at the moment.  At least, thats what I heard, somewhere.   3 billion of them are women , roughly.   1 billion are about the right age.  18 to say 45 or so. It's funny that the 18 will never go up. I'm not so sure about the 45.   500 million are healthy.  Drug attics, starving, disease, ... I wonder if this number should be much, much smaller. With the international AIDS epidemic, I bet the number is smaller.   250 million are of the right level of looks . Lets face it, I'm week I cannot fool myself into thinking that I&nbsp; will find just any one attractive. Also, a very pretty woman is out of my league. She would just leave me. =[   20 million are not involved at the moment.  These are good catches so far. Healthy, cute, of proper age, that's a formula for success.   40 thousand are in the U. S.  The U. S. has about 2% of the world's population. Yet, we use 40% of the worlds energy. I bet that is an old number. I've heard China is about to take over as the fastest growing energy consumer.   2 thousand are in the great state of Texas.  I'm guessing 5% of the U. S. population live in Texas. I don't care if that pretty far off. It gets the point across.   1 thousand will eventually be in the same city as I.  I don't travel much. Hopefully these women do. Optimistically, about half of the women and I will be in the same city at the same time I suppose.   50 of these near perfect matches I will meet.  I don't get out much. I suppose I will only actually run into a precious few of the women who have met the above criteria. I define running into as "hi." ... "hi."   10 women will notice me, and I will notice them.  Ah, this is the one that almost counts. This is where our eyes meet. Our breath grows short. The world stops just for us. That is not love. There is more to it.   1 woman and I will fall in love.

      I thought that this article (see link below) made a lot of sense.  You can use this etiquette advice with you potential dates, or your regular IAM friends.  The key to etiquette is being sensitive and putting yourself in the shoes of others.  So many times I'll tell somebody that I'm busy, or have somebody at my desk.  They keep sending me messages.    Do you have any other IAM advice?  http://msn.match.com/msn/article.aspx?articleid=2389&TrackingID=516164&BannerID=541888

      I've heard stories about parents at little league games, but this one was so dissappointing!  I think that Clemens could have definately provided a better example for parents.  Clemens asked to leave after arguing call Story  --> Houston  Astros  pitcher  Roger Clemens  was asked to leave a youth baseball game over the weekend for arguing a close call that went against his son's team. Photo gallery urlLink Week in baseball   urlLink   Clemens was at the game Saturday watching his son, Kacy, compete in a 10-and-under game organized by Triple Crown Sports when Clemens contested a call at second base that went against the Katy Cowboys. He spit sunflower seeds at an umpire's leg and was asked to leave, said Jim Carpenter, a field supervisor with Triple Crown. "I supported the umpire's decision and he (Clemens) respectfully left," Carpenter told the Craig Daily Press. Katy lost the game to the Bakersfield Curve, 11-5. Triple Crown Sports features a franchise system aimed at pitting top teams from across the country against each other. Clemens' agent, Randall Hendricks, did not immediately return a call Monday. Clemens has racked up 322 wins and 4,240 strikeouts in his 21-year major league career.

      Slug boy slithered back in.  He called Friday asking me to dinner.  I had already planned to meet Wyatt at Brian O’Neill’s.  Slug boy came along.  Whatever. On Saturday after scuba, I was ravenous.  Slug came over to go with me to Tacqueria la Tapetia (which is not as good now that they’re in the fancy new digs).  Then he was stuck running errands with me all day – back over to my place to take my car in to get inspected and the oil changed then back over to the scuba store to get the tanks refilled and for me to get a skin suit, then back over to pick up my car, then back over to Academy and the dollar store, the back to pick up a prescription.  We didn’t plan well, so ½ the stuff was by me and the other ½ was in the Westheimer/Shephard area.  Anyway – the point of all this is that running errands is more bearable when someone else is along.   Especially when it’s a slug boy that knows he’s about to have a ton of salt poured on top of him.   I don’t usually do relationships.  So I figure slug boy is a good practice relationship until the real guy comes along.
