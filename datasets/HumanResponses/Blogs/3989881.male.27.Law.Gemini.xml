      The article below does a pretty good job of explaining why free health care is not good for anybody.&nbsp;Unfortunately the article does not mention&nbsp;one important benefit to us all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without free health care, poor people who can't afford health care will die quicker thereby making less of a demand on our natural&nbsp;resources and&nbsp;thereby&nbsp;helping the environment and reducing our dependance on foreign oil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm kidding but read the article.   urlLink http://www.townhall.com/columnists/walterwilliams/ww20040721.shtml

      Who said Kerry was afraid to take a firm position on controversial issues?&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't think of any issue more controversial than gang violence.&nbsp; Especially with all those pro-gang violence people protesting in the inner&nbsp;cities for the right to be violent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atta boy, JFK.  urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/22/kerry.violence.ap/index.html

      Another Martian meteorite was found in Antarctica.&nbsp; I just read that book by Dan Brown about an antarctic meterorite that supposedly had evidence of alien life.&nbsp; The book mentions a theory, can't remember the&nbsp;name, which holds that all life on earth is alien&nbsp;in that the first microbe or living molecule to inhabit the&nbsp;earth actually came from space and probably was attached to some&nbsp;meterorite that stuck earth eons ago.&nbsp; If you're&nbsp; not a believer in creationism, it presents a good case for the origin of life on this planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't think of another way how life could have spontaneously erupted here.&nbsp; How did we go from&nbsp;nothing to something?&nbsp; Of course, with that being said, we should have evidence of this occurring.&nbsp; I.E., meterorites falling from the sky with alien living creatures on them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hasn't happened&nbsp;yet unless you count the&nbsp;meterorite from 1996 but that's still being investigated.&nbsp; Anyway, doesn't look like there's any alien life on this&nbsp;rock either.&nbsp; Here's an article:  urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/07/22/space.meteorite.reut/index.html   Also, check out this picture of the walking monkey.&nbsp;&nbsp;    urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/07/22/monkey.walking.ap/index.html

      Anyone,i.e., the two people who know this blog exists,&nbsp;should be able to post comments to any of the posts by clicking on the "Comments" link under each post.&nbsp;  Also, because of the number of posts I'm putting up each day I will archive the posts weekly.&nbsp; So next week, all of this weeks post will be archived and retrievable under "Archives" section on the left hand side.&nbsp;&nbsp;I figured that by next week&nbsp;we'll all get nostalgic about this week's post and&nbsp;&nbsp; want to read just what I thought about Bob Dylan on July 21 or&nbsp; perhaps we'll want to relive "The Big Brother Incident" as it is now known in some circles, some very very small circles.&nbsp; Now we'll have that opportunity.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      This Sandy Berger thing is interesting.&nbsp; Stealing documents from the national archives?&nbsp; I know he's saying it was a mistake but apparently these were documents relating to Clinton's actions re:&nbsp; Bin Laden.&nbsp; Imagine if, instead of Berger, it had been Rumsfield or Ashcroft who had gone into the archives and taken some documents that are now missing?&nbsp; People would be screaming for Bush's impeachment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is an interesting article on the subject.   urlLink http://www.news-leader.com/today/0722-Guardsleft-138802.html

      I think my manhood has been seriously put into question by&nbsp;circumstances in the office.   &nbsp;&nbsp;Today, one of the secretaries&nbsp;starting talking about Big Brother to someone in the office.&nbsp; Big Brother is one of the&nbsp;many&nbsp;reality shows I do watch.&nbsp; My curiosity was piqued and so I joined in the conversation about Jayse,&nbsp;Holly and the Four Horsemen, etc.&nbsp;and of course, one of the partners in the firm strolled by.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Reality Show&nbsp;Masculinity Scale, Big Brother&nbsp;probably ranks somewhere in the middle.&nbsp;&nbsp; By default, men are not supposed to be into reality shows unless they involve nudity or violence.&nbsp; Since not too many shows fall into these categories, certain shows are safer than others.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are certain shows like Survivor or the Apprentice that rank high on the Scale because they are huge hits and gender neutral and therefore it is okay to be caught watching them.&nbsp; On the other&nbsp;end are&nbsp;such shows&nbsp;as the Bachelor or For Love or Money which&nbsp;rank&nbsp;low because they are reality shows about&nbsp;love and romance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Society dictates that as a man, I shouldn't watch those shows even though they are fine entertainment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; Big Brother falls somewhere in the middle.&nbsp; Admitting you watch Big Brother is admitting that you watch every single reality show you can.&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding that this basic societal&nbsp;undercurrent&nbsp;existed, I tried to pretend like I was merely observing her and was slightly amused&nbsp;as she talked to her fellow secretaries about the reality shows.&nbsp; But&nbsp;when one&nbsp;of the secretaries asked me a direct question about an event on Big Brother and of course I knew the answer and proceeded to explain&nbsp;how Jayse saved Holly from elimination, I knew the gig was up. &nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing I could do after that&nbsp;was to minimize the damage by ending the conversation as quickly as possible and head back to my desk.&nbsp; When will it be safe for for non-metrosexual,&nbsp;heterosexual men to step out of the closet and admit they watch reality shows and that they&nbsp;in fact enjoy it!&nbsp;

      Does it get any better than Dylan singing "Like A Rolling Stone"?&nbsp; Honestly.&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you ain't got nothing, you&nbsp;got nothing to lose."&nbsp; Bam.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here's my generalized blanket statement of the day, today's music sucks.&nbsp; I don't listen to much of it.&nbsp; Rock, rap, hip hop, whatever.&nbsp; ColdPlay's last album was the most recent one I bought.&nbsp; It's good but doesn't really hold a candle to Dylan's stuff.&nbsp; I may pontificate on this later but I'm at work and being that it's 4:30 in the afternoon, I need to conserve the last remaining drops of fuel in the tank for my final two hour push.&nbsp;

      Looks like this is working.&nbsp; So what am I gonna write about it?&nbsp; Most people pull from their experiences so let's see.......I spend 11 hours a day working in front of a computer, I go home and then watch approximately two hours of reality shows, then go to&nbsp;bed.&nbsp; On the weekends I try to take it easy and go to the movies, go to dinner, and spend time with my girlfriend.&nbsp; Okay, so there you have it, I'll probably spend most of my time writing about work, reality shows, movies, and&nbsp;anything else that pops in my head.&nbsp; Fascinating.&nbsp;

      As I sit in my usual position, slumped in a chair working in front of the computer, &nbsp; I can't help but think how&nbsp;unhealthy this lifestyle is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted, there are worse things I could be doing.....picking up garbage, cleaning septic tanks, construction.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of those things do involve strenuous physical activity though as opposed to what I'm doing.&nbsp;In just about 6 months of doing this I probably gained 20 pounds like it was nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not because I was eating more, but simply because I was doing much less.&nbsp;  I refuse to join a gym though.&nbsp; Isn't it the case that people who are actually members of a gym are those that don't really need a gym?&nbsp; A gym should be for people who need to get in shape.&nbsp; Thus the only people in the gym should be the weak, overweight, and unhealthy.&nbsp; But I've seen very few of those people in any gym I've been&nbsp;in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually the gym is made up of the buff and the beautiful and that just discourages the people that actually need to go, like myself, from going.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Have you ever been in the restroom at work and the person a few stalls down starts talking to themselves? But what about instead of talking, they are talking in a gibberish baby talk, sort of the way you might talk to a pet? Sort of "mooshyhead wittle kitty" type stuff? What do you do? What about this? Have you ever walked into your boss's office only to find him or her walking in a circle and flapping his arms like a chicken?  Pretty bizarre. In both situations, what do you do? In scenario one, the restroom scene, you can probably finish your business, get up to leave the restroom while stealthily taking notice of the shoes under the stall so as to make a positive I.D. later, and then return to your desk to email whoever it may be about the funny thing that happened in the restroom.  But what about scenario #2? What do you do if you see your boss walking around like a chicken? Is it okay to laugh? Do you try to turn around before he knows you saw him? Or do you just pretend like you aren't phased by it and say, "Sir, here's the file you were asking about. blah blah blah"  Final question: What if, instead of you observing these strange acts, you in fact are guilty of committing these acts? Yes, what if you have got up to stretch only to find yourself flapping your arms like you were a chicken. Only by the grace of God were you not spotted. Yes, what if it was you who started pretending to talk to your cat, almost involuntarily, while in the bathroom only to discover, to your horror, that one of your colleagues was two stalls away and had heard the entire episode?  I'm not sure what is wrong with me. Is it possible to become temporarily possessed by a demon-- a retarded demon?

Bush.&nbsp; Well you know what&nbsp;I say?&nbsp; WE.....CAN......DO.....BETTER!!!"&nbsp;  Man, I should be a speech writer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Okay, I'm not burning the midnight oil as it is only 6PM, but it is 6PM and I'm the only person in the office.&nbsp; This is not an unusual or one time occurrence.&nbsp; I'm normally the last to leave everyday.&nbsp; What's worse?&nbsp; An office that stays open til 7pm or 8, forcing you to stay?&nbsp; Or an office that emptys out at 5 but yet compels you to stay because of the amount of work you have?&nbsp; I'm not sure.&nbsp;   Yes, I know the consensus is that it is always better to have an office that closes up shop at 5.&nbsp; That way you have the freedom to leave if you so chose.&nbsp; But it really sucks(and I use the word suck in every sense of the word) when the office empties out and you are&nbsp;no where near finished working.&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly don't&nbsp;get credit&nbsp;for it.&nbsp; If a&nbsp;young associate&nbsp;works til midnight and nobody else is in the office, did it ever really happen?&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess it shows up on my time sheets and I can take solace&nbsp;in that.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Since we all know that Hillary wants to run in '08, the question is will she select Bill as her running mate and then resign so that Bill could be president for a 3d term?&nbsp; Well, we already know that's what&nbsp;she wants to do.&nbsp; The question is CAN she do it?&nbsp; Can&nbsp;slick Willy be&nbsp;made someone's Vice-President?&nbsp; And if so, can&nbsp;an intern with whom he previously had an affair be re-appointed as an intern?&nbsp; The answer is......maybe.&nbsp;   The 22d Amendment limits a person to two elected terms as president. As for whether Clinton could be made vice-president, the law is, guess what, unclear. The 12th Amendment states "But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States."  The issue therefore is whether the 22d amendment is an eligibility requirement, i.e., whether serving two terms makes Clinton "ineligible to the office of President". Arguments go both ways. The general consensus has been that after you've been president twice, you're no longer eligible to be president, and therefore you're also ineligible to be vice-president.   However, Michael Dorf, a law professor at Columbia University argues that the 12th Amendment only bars those from the vice-presidency those person who are "ineligible to the office" of President as opposed to those "ineligible to be president". Clinton meets the eligibility requirements of the office and therefore could be V.P. Others say this ignores the spirit and intent of the 22d amendment which is to prevent anyone from being president more than twice.  This may be a question that never gets settled as it would take legislative action or&nbsp;Clinton actually attempting this trick&nbsp;to get a Supreme Court challenge on the issue.&nbsp;   Here is the article I pulled most of this stuff from:&nbsp;  urlLink www.presidentelect.org/art_preztoveep.html   &nbsp;

      You may be wondering why there has been little, if any discussion of what life is like "working for the man" when the name of this site is workingfortheman.blogspot.com?&nbsp; Well, you see, it's precisely because of the man that I have to be careful about what I say on this blog.&nbsp;   The man knows all and sees all, especially on the computer.&nbsp; There is no privacy and there can be no expectation of privacy when working for the man.&nbsp;&nbsp; He reads your email, he sees what internet sites you frequent, he even knows how much time you spend on those sites.&nbsp; This thing they call a "server" which is connected to this other thing they call a&nbsp;"network" apparently allows the powers that be to eavesdrop on what I'm doing.&nbsp; I don't know how they do it.&nbsp; Apparently there is more than just a hampster wheel&nbsp;keeping my computer operational.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Just now, for example, in the 15 or more minutes it has taken to jot down this little entry, one of the man's drones, a "partner" as he is known, has entered my office twice to obstensibly discuss work related matters.&nbsp; (Isn't it awfully coincidental that you can spend all day working in&nbsp;complete solitude, but as soon as you take a short break to perhaps read an email or check the news, your boss walks in?)&nbsp; I know better.&nbsp; I have become a master with the minimizer button and have&nbsp;thwarted his schemes.&nbsp;   There is only one other place I can think of where my right to privacy would be held in such disregard&nbsp;(no..... not&nbsp;in John Ashcroft's&nbsp;America....)&nbsp; I'm talking about prison.&nbsp; And like&nbsp;in prison&nbsp; "The&nbsp;Word" has&nbsp;to be smuggled out as prisoners would smuggle weapons.&nbsp; &nbsp; You bury it in a sack of potatoes or bag of dirty laundry.&nbsp; That way only the intended recepient, who digs deep enough through all the crap(not that anything in this blog can be&nbsp;called crap)&nbsp;gets the reward.&nbsp; Of course, like&nbsp;convicts in&nbsp;prison I'm destined to&nbsp;one&nbsp; day&nbsp;get caught and crushed&nbsp;but that's okay.&nbsp; &nbsp; Viva la resistance!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I thought the Democrats were the party for the due process junkies and civil libertarians?&nbsp; But it looks like they are trying to quiet the voices of dissention at their convention.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't the act of having a convention&nbsp;pointless now?&nbsp; Hmmmm.....will&nbsp;Kerry&nbsp;get the nomination?&nbsp; What I'm hoping for is that at the last minute, Kerry dumps&nbsp;Edwards and puts Dean on the ticket.&nbsp;   But seriously, what I'm interested in seeing is the news coverage of any protests at the convention this week versus the news coverage of protests at the upcoming Republican convention.&nbsp; There is already talk of how hostile NYC will be to Bush.&nbsp; Will the media portray the Democrats as unified and as the party to "take America back"?&nbsp; And will they then portray the Republicans as being on the defensive and struggling to hold on to power amidst the hostility of the masses?&nbsp; "The Republicans have to rebuild the confidence of the American people.....blah blah blah....."&nbsp; Mark my words, the two conventions will be covered very differently by the media.   urlLink http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=694&u=/ap/20040725/ap_on_el_pr/cvn_protests_2&amp;printer=1

Did I ever go home.  I can't remember.  I vaguely remember seeing my girlfriend and some Amish people.  What was she doing with Amish people?  8:25.....that's still a good 3 hours away from lunch.

      This is a story so big I had to break it apart. I don't know when Part II will come out but here's the first installment.  There are times in your life when you feel as if you were struck with divine inspiration. Such were my thoughts in the fall of 2003 when I came up with "the perfect gift" for my mother for Christmas. Perhaps it would be the gift to end all gifts: NASCAR tickets. My girlfriend agreed that knowing my mom, it was indeed a great gift and much better than my standard Gift Certificate to Outback Steakhouse gift of years past. I have since begun to wonder whether I was struck with inspiration or a curse.  My mother is a huge NASCAR fan. For the past 10 years or so she has become a devoted follower. I knew she would love it. Plus the next available race would be the Coca Cola 400 in Daytona in July 2004 around the anniversary of my dad's death so it would make a nice distraction for her from all that.  One problem was getting her to the race. It would be a long drive to Daytona for her to make alone. I was then struck a second time by brilliance. I would get tickets for my brother and his girlfriend. Talk about two birds with one stone. In one stroke I would solve the problem of 1)what to get him and 2)how to get my mother to the race. They could drive to Daytona and as part of the package I would pay for a hotel room for them for the night. I immediately went on-line and purchased 3 race tix at about $150/each in premier seats near the start/finish line. Add a hotel to the equation and Iwas going to top $600 easy. Yes, that's steep but I wasn't going to turn back.  Christmas comes and the gift is revealed and everyone seems pleased. But just a few days later I get a phone call from mom, "Can you get your money back for those tickets? Your brother doesn't want to go." I'm dumbfounded. Doesn't want to go? "Yeah, he's worried about the smoke and his allergies." Oh my God. To detail why and how my brother is a bastard could take weeks of blog entries. As a child he expressed his affection for me by telling me he hoped I would rot in hell. Sometimes he left out the "in hell" part and just said "I hope you rot". Nice. There's also the "we went to Wal-Mart to buy mountain bikes but ended up almost killing each other" story. That may warrant its own entry. Suffice it to say, I wasn't too surprised by these turn of events.  My girlfriend's advice was to talk to my brother, have it out with him. I think she knew that wasn't going to happen so plan b was for my mom to invite some friends along to go with her. Since the race was still 6 months away I told mom to try and get some friends to go with her and I would let them have my brother's tix for free. To no avail. Mom could find nobody to go with her to the race. She again told me to return the tix, get my money back and get her a gift certificate to "Home Depot". This idea was even worse than the Gift Certificate to Outback routine. Home Depot? What was she going to do with that? Buy paint? What kind of gift is that? Realizing hope was all but lost there was only one way to salvage the racing trip. I went to my girlfriend with a proposal: What if we go with my mom to the race?  .....stay tuned for part II.......

      This is too cool.  It's the only known audio recording of JFK's assassination and was made by a police motorcycle.  The recording, unfortunately, is too fragile to be played but it apparently recorded 4 not 3 shots being fired and one of those shots were not fired from Oswald's location.   I just love the Kennedy assassination.  No, I don't love the fact that he was assassinated.  It was terrible and perhaps the country would have been better off had he lived.  Nevertheless, his assassination is one of the most fascinating events in American history.  The lone gunman, the school book depository, the grassy knoll.  It's a mystery that will never be solved.   urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Southwest/08/02/jfk.tape.ap/index.html

      Saw two good movies over the weekend, "The Village" and "The Manchurian Candidate".  Both are suspense thrillers with political over/undertones.  With the Village you can draw analogies to the war on terror and politicians using fear to maintain control, etc.  But the Candidate, you really don't have to draw any analogies as the message is clear:  Our system is corrupt.    Democrat/Republican--its just different shades of gray.  Is it any wonder that the only issues that seem to divide Republicans and Democrats are the social issues--gay rights, abortion, etc.?  Those issues really have no impact on how the world is run yet those issues divide the electorate.  I'm beginning to think those issues are a ruse designed to keep us from paying attention to what is really going on.  What is going on you ask?  Not sure.  But I do know that for 150 years we've had the same two political parties.  Why is that?  Well, didn't the 1860s mark the beginning of the Boss Tweed era and Taminy Hall.  We had the intro of the political machine that controlled the parties.  Those machines are still at work.   Look at our candidates, Kerry and Bush.  One is a rich, Ivy League Grad and the other is a rich Ivy League Grad.  One has declared a war on terror, the other will continue the war on terror.  One launched a war with Iraq, the other supported the former's decision to go to Iraq.  See where I'm going here?   Anytime over the past several years that there has been a candidate who would truly shake things up, they've failed.  Dean, Perot, RFK, William Jennings Bryan, even Nader.  Some of these men have come from one of the two major parties while the others were third party candidates.  Some of these shakers were killed, i.e. RFK.  The others befell to some strange circumstances.  Remember 1992.  Perot mysteriously dropped out of the race right before the election but then dropped back in.  By the time he came back in it was too late.  Look at Dean.  Had the momentum, had the Dems motivated, then out of nowhere, Kerry takes Iowa, Dean implodes and we're off to the races.   What do we know about 3 party candidates?  They don't win.  We've been conditioned to know they won't win so we don't vote for them.  But guess what, if we voted for them, they'd win.  That's the secret.  Vote for them, and they'd win.    Unfortunately we're looked in this groupthink where we can only select a or b.  There is no viable choice c.  So in the end, why vote?  What does it matter?

       urlLink http://news.myway.com/top/article/id/381249top08-09-2004::17:46reuters.html   Even without WMD's Kerry would still have voted for the president's use of force in Iraq.  Wow!  I guess that takes that issue off the table.  Well actually it probably doesn't.  Kerry will still try to play both sides by saying, "I support the troops but the president was wrong!"  Whatever.  He's an armchair quarterback and can say whatever he wants.

      It's 12:30pm on a beautiful sunny Sunday afternoon.  I had a good night's sleep, waking up by my own internal clock at 9.  The PGA Championship comes on in a bit.  Perhaps my girlfriend and I could go catch the matinee.  Yep, nothing beats looking at the world from 43 stories up.  What?  43 stories up?  I'm not in a plane flying to the Bahamas so that must mean  I'm at work!!!!  I'm in the office.  It's Sunday and I'm in the office.  This is not the way to live.  Nobody else is here so why am I?  I don't know.  I have work to do.  But doesn't everybody else?  Can't explain it.  It befuddles me.  I should be at home where there are more important things to do like play with the cat or watch my TiVoed Big Brother episode from last night.  But no, I'm working.   I guess I better get back to it too.  Damn it.
