        So, have they slept together? Does he "look" like a virgin?   (cover artists:  Jan Duursema & Joe Wayne

        On the Dark Horse boards, people assume that Quinlan Vos has a sexual relationship with Khaleen Hentz. This may be inferred from some of the issues in which they appear. Even though there's obviously sexual tension between them, I'm not sure that they've actually done it.  I'm basing this on a certain panel in    urlLink  Republic #63   ,    which unfortunately, isn't part of the preview on the Web site. Anyhow, it occurs when Khaleen wakes Quin from a meditative nightmare. The characters are facing each other, but their faces aren't shown. Instead, all that's depicted are her boobs and his unlit lightsaber in his hand, pointed at her chest. How phallic is  that?   The next panel shows only his eyes--he's glaring at her. Then a picture of her face telling him why she disturbed his meditation.  Finally, there's a picture that shows both characters fully, with Quin re-attaching his lightsaber onto his belt. In this panel, a rattled Khaleen says, "You were about a heartbeat from putting your lightsaber through me!" His answer? "No, I wasn't."  Everything but, perhaps? And if he  had  put his lightsaber through her, would it symbolize the physical act, the result of which kills Khaleen? I'll have to think about the implications there.  Anyway, my question is, if they  have  had sex, wouldn't Quin have been a virgin? I mean, he was raised in the Temple and all, and peer pressure, if any existed within, would probably have been on things such as lightsaber combat or something. More than likely, he didn't have to cope with "normal" pressure that "normal" teens confront: drinking, sex, stuff like that.  And yet, some of the forum members think he's a player. Personally, for Quin, I prefer the term "playa." "Player" sounds too...well, cleancut. Or something. And let me tell you, when he first appears as his bad undercover self in    urlLink  Republic #49    ,   he is most definitely a P-I-M-P. Look at him on the cover  (cover artist - Ryan Benjamin) :           If this ain't a Jedi gangsta, I don't know what is. Holla!       Anyhow, perhaps people think he's a sex machine because he doesn't "look" like a virgin. But then, what does a virgin look like? A Jedi virgin? Obi-Wan? Hmm . . .

         urlLink Aayla Secura . Before "graduating" from the Jedi Academy, she was Quinlan Vos's Padawan (but that isn't why I like her). In fact, she and Quin were promoted to Knight and Master respectively, at the same time.  I like Aayla because she's a Twi'lek who isn't a stupid dancing girl. She kicks ass and, in fact, kicked  urlLink Aurra Sing 's ass, who I can't stand. Aurra's pretty cool looking in a Goth (but cooler) sort of way, but she's a total, total psycho. In fact, the "real" version (played by an actress) isn't even as scary looking as the comics version. But I have to admit, she has a great hair color.  In the comics where it flashbacks to when Aayla was still Quin's Padawan, she looked very much like  urlLink Mission Vao  from KotOR. The weird thing is, adult Aayla is blue. But as a youngster she was like, turquoise-colored, more like Mission.

       In the upcoming  urlLink Republic #71  , to be released in November, people have speculated that Quin will be killed off. In the above link, it says: "Vos is finally captured and broght [sic] to justice for his crimes."    However, just because he's captured doesn't mean he'll be killed. After all, the Jedi honor life and only kill if it's unavoidable. Had Depa regained her faculties, she would have gone to trial, but I doubt the Council would have executed her. Perhaps she could have been redeemed. Maybe the same will happen with Quin. I hope.

        urlLink Quinlan Vos . Because he's a bad-ass Jedi--more so than Mace Windu, even. Or, what the hell? More so than Shaft.  I can totally picture Quin parking his Mobquet Flare-S swoop bike (he doesn't have a swoop in  Republic  but he should) in a prominent spot on the Jedi Temple's landing platform, then swaggering into the Temple, dressed not in Jedi robes, but in his Guardian armor. Then the theme from  Shaft  plays in the background (this is the Temple, after all, so this could be a Force occurrence): *funky guitar riff--wicka-wicka-wank, wicka-wicka-wicka-wank* Mace - "You see Master Vos is a bad mother--(Yoda - shut your mouth)." So, can ya dig it?  He walks the fine line between LS and DS, which is a great struggle to watch/read. This dichotomy makes the character more than 2-D, and perhaps more believable. Jedi are not infallible, and his characterization really shows this. In addition, I like the added dimension John Ostrander provides by having Quin basically deluding himself into thinking that he hasn't gone DS, that he's still working undercover.  He's a brooder, and in many ways that I won't go into right now, a Byronic hero. I like Byronic heroes.  And, OMG, he's sooooo hot. I mean, for a comic book character. Is that weird? I'm turning into a fangirl, I think, which seems a bit silly for someone my age, but so what? What do I care? The guy's hot, what do you want? Jan Duursema's a great artist.  Besides, he reminds me very much of the "bad boys" I used to date back when I dressed like Khaleen--hot pants, fishnets, all that.

        I don't know who, if anyone, will be reading this, so maybe I'm writing this--ha ha--"mission statement" for myself.      Anyway, I have a LiveJournal, but that's all miscellaneous details of my sordid life. I wanted something separate in which to post my thoughts and opinions on anything related to Star Wars, as well as some things that are remotely related, but related nonetheless, to same. Also, for anyone who does read my LJ, I have to warn you that some stuff may be crosslisted.      Done.
