      Yesterday was very fun.  Well, not really.  Skippy and Tyke went on an adventure to THE JUNGLE.  The Jungle was oddly enough, not actually a jungle.  More like Bell Square really.  But nonetheless Skippy and Tyke met up with Tina, Frederique Frangelica, and Shawna Shawshank.  They also hung out with Macaroon and Tyronius but Amed Annoying was there as well so they made sure to not talk to him.  Skippy and Tyke were their usual studly selves and the three foxes were very impressed.  So they went back to Skippy's house and "had fun."

      Tyke and Skippy went on a walk through the enchanted forest of Mrah.  While on the downtrodden path, the two mischeivous souls found a treasure map full of routes to take in order to reach the mysterious prize.  The boys decided, instead of following the map, to burn it and go to the local strip club.  This turned out to be a marvelous choice.  Tyke met up with Purdy McHot there and they went on a long romantic walk past Macaroon McGee's house.  They peeked in the window and saw a sight that they did not want to see.  It was Macaroon and Tyronius making out on McGee's loveseat.  So the two lovebirds, Tyke and Purdy, went back to Purdy's house, watched friends, and made out.

      It was a cold, blustery day in Abregla with the wintry weather just around the corner.  Tyke and Skippy were walking down the yellow-brick road when they heard voices from a distance.  The voices got nearer and nearer and finally the two teens noticed that the voices came from none other than three hot female specimens.  Tyke remembered them as Tina TightShirt, Samantha Succulent, and Purdy McHot.  The two girls were very horny and decided to go back to Tyke's bachelor pad.  When they got there the action got heated.  Tyke, Tina, and Purdy got it on in his room while Skippy and Samantha went at it in the bathroom.

      The troublesome teens, Tyke and Skippy, are on their way to getting into wild adventures.  Look for future episodes involving college sororities and drunken meetings with gnomes and trolls.

      Well, tis been a while since the wonderful world of Tyke and Skippy has been discussed.  On the Tuesdays to end all Tuesdays, Tyke, Skippy, and Tyronius had a splendid birthday bash for Skippy's 18th.  It was awesome.  Playboy=Hot chicks.  AAR=Huge (pronounced hooge) bazoomas on display.  And wow, these puppies were succulent and Tyke even remarked that they were "the best set i have seen next to Purdy's purdy pair."  On whimsical Wednesday, Skippy and Tyke were extremely hungover from their escapades but managed to trudge through the day with a smile on their face.  Tyke and Dottie Hottie had their usual snugglefest in the worst class EVARRR!!!! (english with Mrs. Dyke-Bitch).  Dottie is such a hottie.  How can you not love her.  Skippy got his magnificent present from Purdy McHot and was pleased to say the least.  Some toys for the bedroom is what they will be used for.  Wink wink.  Wink wink wink.  Wait, what?  Wink.  Then the three went back to Purdy's and watched Friends.  Wait, that was a different day.  Nope same thing.  Then Mandy Moneymaker joined up with them and they went back to Skippy's house for a love fest.  Good times.  This day ended as most days do.  With a love fest.

      Tyke and Skippy went to see a movie that rhymes with Gay-dio on Saturday night.  Accompanying the two studs was their hottie with a body Karla Kind as well as the best buds Macaroon, Tyronius, Amed, and his new gal pal Dolores Dandelion.  The two felt the movie was a poignant tale and were pleased by it.  Upon completion, the group went back to Tyke's pad for some dancing action which involved Tyke getting into a really really hot outfit that showed off his insanely masculine physique.  It is insanely wickedly and awesomely muscular.  No joke.  Really, no joke.  Well, I guess if you compare his body to an ant.  Actually ants are really strong aren't they?  Can't they lift like 30 times their body weight?  Or is it 10?  Or 3?  Hmmm...what is it?  So I guess if you compare his physique to a 2 year old girl then he is the most muscular person ever seen.  But then the group did more stuff not worthy of mention.  Except they played a game that rhymes with Hunty Feconds.  It was unsuccessful but Karla was not so kind with her playing even though at one time it is apparent that she did comply with the rules but there is no way to know.  Nonetheless, it is a fun game.  It may be labeled as perverse and that is probably fitting but it is still fun and if you don't believe so then you are either gay or a girl that isn't real open.  Then everyone left and Tyke cleaned up and had yet another night with build up but no completion ;).

      Last night Tyke and Skippy went to Mandy's surprise 18th birthday party.  It was really fun for Tyke, and Skippy at least had some fun.  Frederique, Tina, and Tyke had fun playing cards and talking and laughing.  Laughing is fun.  Girls like laughing.  Tyke likes making girls laugh.  Tyke likes laughing.  Tyke likes laughing with girls.  Tyke just remembered he has to read Metamorphosis this weekend.  Tyke just got a little angry.  Tyke is ok now though.  Tyke is just rambling.  Stop Tyke.  Tyke stopped.  But seriously guys...Tyke is fun.  Today Tyke had a soccer game.  Actually he didn't but he was supposed to and it was going to be his first game back from his brief absence from the team.  He was going to score goals but was not given the chance.  Oh well, tomorrow he will and he is going to have fans at his game too.  He is excited for that.  He likes fans.  Fans like him.  Tyke=fun.

      The lives of Tyke and Skippy have been rather depressing lately.  They have just had a feeling of sadness lately and some sentiments that relate to their loneliness.  Things will look up but this is just one of those times.

      Tyke and Skippy have had uneventful days ever since Saturday.  Saturday was a blast though especially playing the wonderful game of 20 Seconds.  Skippy and Mandy basically had sex and Tyke had some fun of his own with Lisa Lovey.  Tyke also made up a new game called Musical Laps.  The premise of the game is quite similar to the game Musical Chairs.  However, one sex is sitting down and acting as the chairs.  The music starts and the opposite sex walks around the circle and when the music stops the walkers have to stop and sit on the sitter's lap and then the sitter has to guess who it is.  The winners advance to the next round and the winners win.  Ask Tyke if you don't understand the game.

      WOW, all can be said about today is WOW.  It started off with Tyke getting up at approximately 9:23 to take a shower and make himself clean for his soccer game (paradoxical???).  But soccer was a breeze.  Pretty much a raping.  They fucked the other team.  13-1 was the final score.  Tyke had 2 goals and 2 assists and this really isn't important is it...oh well.  Well then he went to Costco with Macaroon, Tyronius, and Kinker and his parents and Tyke got a Hand Dipped Super Premium Ice Cream Bar with Almonds.  MMMMMMMM....GOOOOOOD....AHHHHH.  It was heaven-ish.  Then he went home and began down the long and winding road towards completion of the worst shaping outline that was ever forced upon a student.  It was done just 8 hours later at approximately 9:40 and that was one of the earliest times on the information super highway.  Others took quite a while to do so.  But he finished and that is all that matters.  He also went to a party for a girl and it was ok.  He lost to Skippy 105-84 in paper football but it was a great game.  Other than that he pretty much said nothing to anyone.  Ya know, his usual lonesome self.  Not that it is other people's fault for him not talking but he doesn't like having to barge in on conversations or anything like that.  He just likes to be invited or when he is really sad he likes it when someone will notice and just come up and give him a hug or come sit next to him or just smile and wink at him or something.  That makes all the difference.  Just letting someone know he cares.  He thinks he does this but he just realized that he doesn't really and he doesn't want to be hypocritical so he is going to try and show it more often.  Less jokes, more...oooo need a word that ends in -okes...hmmm...smokes?? no...hmmm...there isn't a word so it will have to be cloaks.  Less jokes more cloaks.  He still loves Tina.  Man, she's great...Even though she never called him back.  Ya know how on TV and in the movies girls always complain about how guys never call them back?  Yeah, well don't think that girls call back all the time.  Cuz they sure as hell don't.  Oh well, he isn't mad...just sad.  Tomorrow he will probably find out why she didn't call.  Maybe she was hurting.  Yeah, she did just play basketball.  Or maybe she was lying.  Or maybe she just didn't want to hang out with him and by not calling that was her way of trying to let him know that.  Awww...hopefully it is not the last one.  That one is sad.  Especially because of how much...Damn, that is sad.  Damn.  All he can think about saying to her is: "I don't know how you do what you do.  I'm so in love with you.  It just keeps getting better.  I wanna spend the rest of my life with you by my side forever and ever.  Every little thing that you do baby I'm amazed by you."

      Today was ok.  Tyke went to school as did most seniors and he didn't really do much at all.  Most of his friends were there and he had a fun lunch going out to lunch with Tina, Dottie, and Purdy among others.  It was fun and...well, it was just fun i guess.  Then since he does not have school the next day he went with Macaroon and his friend to Best Buy which was cool cuz he got Desperado/El Mariachi for like 8 bucks thanks to his Best Buy bucks he earned from McDonald's.  That was good.  Then he went back to Macaroon's house and played DDR2!  It was fun and there are some really cool songs on there.  They then went to McDonald's and GI Joes and then back to Tyke's place.  There they watched MNF and waited for Skippy and Karla to come over.  Tyronius decided to come over too so he did.  BUT...the person Tyke wanted most to come over did not.  Tyke called Tina when he was at McDonald's and she said she had basketball but she would call him afterwards.  As usual, she did not call him.  Maybe Tyke is too forgiving but he understood and sorta didn't expect her to call, even though he wanted her to and was disappointed when she didn't.  But he and the gang still watched Desperado and a good sex scene always lightens up a crowd.  But then everyone left and Tyke was left alone to do nothing but sleep.  So he did so.  But Tyke still wanted to hang out with Tina or at least talk to her again so he could try and get her to come to his game on Tuesday at Lake Sammamish Field 9 at 11 AM.  Yeah, that is kinda early but still.  Oh well, maybe she will come anyway.  Yeah, right...fat chance...HA! more like no chance.  Oh well.  Eh.

      Well, Tyke has been pretty much the same for a week now.  There have been moments, like whenever he is with Tina, that he feels absolutely wonderful and that nothing could ever go wrong.  However for the most part the rest of his days go poorly.  He is soooo in love with Tina that it hurts.  But strangely enough he almost feels it is a good hurt.  He thinks that there isn't a better girl in the world that he could love and put all his soul into.  She is what keeps him from beating the shit out of their first period teacher and it is she that keeps him smiling and laughing all through the day.  Her face is his sky and her smile is his sun.  Without her smile he would surely die a frozen death and his soul would be left for the wolves who somehow manage to live without the sun.  But then again they are wolves.  But seriously, Tyke thinks the world of Tina and though he is mostly against her relationship with Kram because of his own longing for a relationship with her, he knows that there is nothing he can do but long for the day when he and Tina go to prom together.  Though this will not happen, just like she will not go to his soccer game even though she and Purdy said they would, he will continue to hope so and who knows, maybe this time she will come through with her promise.  She did say, when Tyke said that they would go to prom if he had his way, that she hopes he has his way.  That was a great day.  Every day with Tina is a great day.  Even if it is a day that starts out with Tyke and Tina walking to math together and then Tyke getting ditched for Kram.  Ditched isn't necessarily the right word because she did at least make it look like she felt bad/didn't want to just leave him by himself when she walked with her boyfriend.  But she still did ditch him.  But hey, they are going out and Tyke is just a guy that she can always count on for the rest of her life and one who believes that she can do no wrong in his eyes.  Even though if she killed someone that would be wrong but if it was accidental it would be fine.  But she would not do that.  She is the comforter on his bed who keeps him warm and cozy at night and who he wants to sleep with every night in his life.  Hehe.  Again, but seriously...Tyke+Tina=L4L (love for life).

      Tyke had a normal day.  Well it snowed and that was wicked cool and according to the weather reports it might snow for the football game on Friday!  THAT WOULD BE SICK!!!!  Boyz II Men is playing right now.  Tyke is gonna make a Christmas CD too this year...that should be fun.  Give him some good songs if you have any.  And if they are holiday related but not technically Christmas songs that is fine.  I guess it could be a Non-Denominational CD of songs that are played mostly during the month of December but spill out to both November and January.  Yeah, that is gonna be written for the title of the CD.  Yo betta bolieve it!

      Tyke has had a very deep 24 hours.  Last night he had a long talk with Dr. Phil Lelee online about his true feelings for Tina.  He really grilled him on whether or not he really knew Tina and what their relationship is at the moment and what he finds attractive in her and if he is not just falling in love with a dream or ideal person.  Tyke really learned from this experience and it made him rethink his place.  He thus began to see Tina in a different light, although not a bad one it is different from what he past perceived.  He does understand the fact that there might not even be a point in "chasing" her.  And he is actually considering whether or not to continue on the path he is on now which could just lead to further heartbreak and despair or whether to take the next turn in life.  This is not a decision that can be made overnight and it may take quite some time to actually decide.  But the point is that, despite his feelings for Tina, he might be giving up his seemingly pointless pursuit of a girl that is just out of his league.  He is a hopeless romantic and in this situation the key word is HOPELESS.  So ladies, if you are looking for a guy who will devote himself to you, talk to Tyke.  Well that sounds bad, sounds a little obsessive/desperate.  That is not the intended message.  Tyke is available.  There, that sums it up.

      Well today was alright.  Tyke talked with Skippy before school and then had math with Tina and Karla.  That can be fun.  It was today.  Then Tina took Tyke's Lit Book and wrote him a message in it and hid it for him in english.  He found it though.  Then Tyke talked to Purdy in english and she first said that she read this blog for the first time and then she started off by saying that he is obsessed with Tina.  Tyke is tired of hearing that though.  It gets kinda old after 4 years but it isn't Purdy's fault for thinking this.  Most people seem to.  Oh well, he is just Truly Madly Deeply (song on the cd he made tonight) in love with her.  Then Purdy said that he should confess his love to her but Dottie disagreed at lunch and so did Tyke.  Seeing as Tina and Kram are going out and that his confessing it would not gain him anything and would probably just make things more awkward or just different between them.  But Purdy later realized that this would probably be a bad idea to confess so she is on his side too.  It isn't that Tyke is scared to do so but he just feels it isn't right and that there is nothing to accomplish.  Not that there needs to be something accomplished through his confessing his love.  It should only be said to let Tina know how he feels about her.  It isn't like by telling her, she will magically fall in love with him.  This isn't a fairy tale.  Life doesn't work like the movies.  How much simpler would it be though?  I mean, good people wouldn't die unless they were being stupid and nice guys would get the girl after the girl realized her boyfriend was an ass and that the guy who has deep feelings for her is really the right guy.  But anyway, Tyke knows that he cannot change Tina and can only cherish the time they spend together and hope that they get to hang out more often.  ~*~

      Well, Tyke hasn't done much lately.  Wednesday night was the Physics review session which was fun (and by fun I mean hard).  Thursday and Friday weren't that much fun, mainly because Tina wasn't in his 1st period class because she was at Azusa with Purdy.  But Tyke trudged through it and had fun with Karla.  Karla is a good girl.  On Thursday and Friday Tyke didn't really do anything.  Friday was supposed to be a day where the guys hung out with Mandy and Haras Relda but Haras didn't call Tyke back.  Oh well, there seems to be a pattern of that going on though.  I guess that Tyke isn't one of those guys you wanna call back.  Eh, no matta.  Saturday was ok.  Tyke had soccer in Woodinville right before the state playoff game but he won and scored a goal.  Then they went to the game and had some fun.  The second half was fun because he sat and talked with Tina the whole time.  If only the two were going out.  But then after the game they went to McD's (see Skippy's blog for a little more info).  Today Tyke had soccer in Bothell and he went with Macaroon and Tyronius.  They won and Tyke scored again as usual.  Then they went to McD's on the way home.  Then he watched football and kinda napped.  Then he came online.  Then...

      Well today Tyke is going to take a different route with his blog.  Instead of his usual topics he is going to feel sorry for himself for once.  OH WAIT!!!  HE ALWAYS FEELS SORRY FOR HIMSELF!!!  Damn that sucks.  First off on the way home to Purdy's house from the football game Tyke, Skippy, Purdy, Macaroon, Tyronius, and Mandy all decided that Tyke is the most pathetic but also that he and Tina should be voted Couple That Should Have Been in the yearbook at the end of the year.  But then after Tyke dropped everyone but Skippy and Mandy off Tyke found out another interesting fact that is very true.  When he and Skippy asked Mandy why they didn't have girlfriends she said it was because they are too nice.  Finally, Tyke learns that this really is the truth.  He always thought this but no girl really told him so.  So thank you Mandy, this made Tyke feel worse and better at the same time.  But it really is true.  The guys are too nice to be boyfriends.  They are better had as friends.  And as upsetting as this may be to the boys, at least it is better than being an arse that nobody likes :/.  Eh, another sad night.  The sad thing is that Tyke almost wishes the reason that he didn't have a girl that liked him was because he was like ugly or skinny or something that he was just born with.  But his being a great guy is something that he could but wouldn't want to change.  He probably couldn't even be meaner if he tried.  He doesn't like that.  He just wishes that he found a girl that liked him for who he is, a genuine, nice, fun guy.  Is she out there?  (If so what is her name and phone number?)  Where are you dream girl?  Oh and by the way, Tyke is just seeing no future with Tina which is making him think that he might as well just flat out give up and find something else to do.  She isn't gonna come around and he knows so.  This would mean that he is on the search for a new girl-although he still has very strong feelings for Tina but he is going to try and submerge those.

      Another day that could have been great but instead was just eh.  Even Tyke's mom was surprised when today after school he just came home and didn't have anything to do.  His mom never expects him to do anything and now he actually doesn't do anything and she seems all shocked.  Right after school Purdy and Tyke got in Purdy's car and started to go to Albertson's when Tyke called Skippy and they saw him walking so they invited him to join.  So they all went there and they saw THING 1 and THING 2 at Albertson's in MONSTROUS SIZE!!!  I mean the size of Tyke's old My Buddy doll is how big it was!!!  It was great.  But it was like 20 bucks so the two spendthrifts decided to wait until a better time to make this purchase.  (Tyke just noticed that Skippy left his teriyaki in his house...that bastard)  But then Purdy drove the two back to the school where the three parted ways forever.  Well at least for a little while.  Tyke then met up with Skippy at Teriyaki Bistro (eh...) and they got some food and went to Freddy M's.  Tyke had called Mandy prior to leaving and she said that she was going to come over.  Also, Tyke had talked to Dottie about her maybe making an appearance and she said she might (but like the other girls in Tyke's life either forgot or decided not to try and make time for dropping by) but that is ok because this is Dottie's first time and she is really nice so he forgives her.  And she had a friend in from Seattle so he is alright with it.  But when Tyke and Skippy came home Tyke looked at the monitor and saw that Mandy had decided not to come over.  Damn, that is like 200 times in the past two weeks that Tyke has been either dropped by a girl, not been called back, not been called, or just flat out not hung out with.  Well more like 5-6 times but still it is getting old.  He is beginning to give up on his quest for a girl to cherish for just a girl to freaking hang out with on regular occasions!  Whatever happened to friends hanging out together outside of school!!!  And once a week seeing Friends together for about an hour and then meeting at the football game does not count.  Purdy has been out of town I suppose but that means that she better try and make up for it.  She knows how to do so too...(and if she doesn't don't worry, cuz I don't know either).  But anyway Tyke and Skippy spent the night watching Rich Girls, playing DDR, watching OC, playing DDr, and watching Aladdin.  When Skippy left Tyke continued to play DDR.  He is good.  Maybe the next time the girls hang out with him he can show them how good he is.  Whoa, Tyke just had a flashback to a dream he had pretty recently.  And it was actually more like a nightmare.  It was at night and Kinker and Emilio Testeves along with a bunch of other people were at Tyke's house.  Well it became scary and Kinker and Emilio were the bad guys.  Kinker made the lights go out and stuff and then he had knives and he started throwing them at people and they were killing people.  Tyke kept running away and then he made it outside but Emilio was outside and he had like butcher's knives.  Tyke knew that he must be on the deck so he slowly walked out from underneath it and looked up and sure as he thought he saw Emilio ready to hit him in the face with a cleaver.  But he missed with a couple and then Tyke picked them up, able to use them himself.  So then when he got in a chance to hit Emilio he missed of course and then he was down to one knife but he had an easy throw to hit Emilio in the back of the head but he missed and then Emilio had all the knives and Tyke was cornered.  Well he started to run away and by this time Kinker was back also trying to kill Tyke but Tyke thought he could get away by jumping the fence in his backyard.  Well to bring things to a close he tried but fell back into the yard and a little before Emilio and Kinker were coming over to kill him the dream ended.  That took a lot of room.  Do you guys want me to break the future recaps into more than one paragraph?  Just let me know.

      Ok well that last little part is probably not going to happen.  You can't just turn off this faucet of love.  It has to be broken from a pipe underneath the sink.  But at the moment the water is getting colder.  But tomorrow is a new day and it will probably warm up the water.

      Tyke and Tuesday mixed well today.  Tyke just wrote that last sentence and then stopped and then he got sad.  He started thinking about how he might hang out with Tina on Wednesday night but then he realized that he is just kidding himself and that neither tomorrow, Thursday, nor the rest of the week are the two going to hang out other than in class and at the football game on Friday.  Well, that ain't all bad.  No, it sucks.  Oh well, Tyke is far from content with his situation with her but it is better than nothing.  Tina had detention again today and her and Tyke walked and talked again.  This time though Tina came to Tyke instead of Tyke coming to Tina.  Sigh.  Sigh.  Why does she have to have a boyfriend?  They don't even go out to lunch much or talk much it seems.  To Tyke, it seems like he and Tina are closer to each other than Tina and Kram.  Damn, Tyke thinks too much of his situation.  He isn't really that close to being with Tina.  Tina probably doesn't even think about how Tyke feels or even think about him outside of when they are together.  Thats it...Tyke is getting over Tina starting now.  There is no point for him to keep pursuing her since he has done an absolutely horrible job these past 4 years.

      Another day of Tyke's life has passed.  The days are blurring together now.  Today was an easy day for Tyke.  This whole week will be.  Now for the continuation of the on-going Tyke and Tina situation.  Well today after school Tina had detention.  Tyke knew this and they happened to see each other in the parking lot.  They talked in the Senior lot for a little and then Tina said she was going to detention.  Tyke said he would walk with her and he did.  They talked about how weird and annoying Yurtle Yuck was and then Tyke asked Tina if she wanted to just sit in his car while they waited for Michelangelo to go supervise detention.  So they got to his car and saw Michelangelo walking back to the school so they got out and walked together towards detention.  On the way there Tyke said hi to Commander Cool (cool name, eh?).  Tyke and Tina talked some more and then got to detention to find out that Michelangelo wasn't there so they couldn't even start detention yet.  So Tyke stayed and they talked and also with another girl.  Tina and the other girl said that Tyke should stay and just serve detention with them but he didn't know if he would.  About 5 minutes later Michelangelo came to watch over the detainees and Tyke decided not to stay so he left Tina and put in an order for his transcripts.  This experience may have sounded boring but it was not and it was exciting.  The question Tyke thought of though was does Tina know that Tyke is so head over heels for her?  He felt it was obvious that he was.  He walked all around with her after school and almost did detention with her when he didn't even have it.  Doesn't this seem like a little bit more than just a friendly gesture?  Maybe Tyke is just crazy.  The next thing that Tyke thought about was whether or not he should show Tina this Blog.  Maybe tell her: "Next time you are bored at home by yourself go to (insert URL here)."  But could this ruin things?  Give Tyke your thinking (especially if you are a girl since that is what Tina is).

      Life continues for the hopeless-romantic Tyke Turner.  His feelings for Tina have not changed and in fact they might have even escalated to a whole new level.  He still tries to think about his feelings though rather than just let them run wild-if that makes any sense.  But he has been talking to her and just feels that there could be something so special there even though she does not see that.  She is sorta teasing him lately though with her voiced willingness to hang out together but then she never comes through with it.  Take the Apple Cup for instance.  Tyke had an early soccer game but Skippy was at Zena's birthday thingy and Tina was there apparently so when Skippy called Tyke Tina said hi.  That was nice...and Tyke is such a loser that he saved that message.  Man, maybe he is obsessed with her.  Is he?  No, he can't be.  Can he?  Damn, now he feels bad that he is so enamored by her.  Arrgghh, why does he need to feel so?  But on a totally different note, Tyke had a weird dream last night.  It was mainly about Purdy.  It was just weird because of what happened in the dream and how it was Purdy in it instead of Tina.  No, it was not a sex dream though but more of just want Tyke wants with Tina.  Snuggling and some kissing.  But really it was weird because it was Purdy in the dream and Skippy was there too.  Haha, hey Purdy, if you are reading this hey!  Hahahaha...that is funny if you are reading this.  Don't worry it isn't like this dream made Tyke fall head over heels in love with you.  Haha, just odd that the dream had you in it instead of Tina.  Oh well...3 DAY WEEK!  3 DAY WEEK!  3 DAY WEEK!!!!!

      Friday night was really very fun.  It started out with everyone coming over at like 7 to get ready to surprise Macaroon.  That was really good because Tyke popped in some old movies of him while they waited.  Movies such as the infamous 10th Grade Biology video which is sure to be lodged in the memories of all who have seen it in full.  It is something else.  Simply amazing.  Wow, Tyke was so cool when he was younger.  Now he is just awesome.  Tyke likes to toot his own horn.  Mainly cuz he doesn't get it tooted by anybody else (sorry for the attempt at a double meaning there for it was not meant to be a serious statement...just a jocose statement).  Then when Macaroon got there Tyke and the gang surprised the hell out of him.  It was so great.  Unbelievably great.  He had no idea.  He thought the surprise was for Amed.  Nope, wrong Mr. McGee.  So they played DDR basically for 4 hours.  A little HAGSITDWSO in there and some Dance Twister (yeah, that is still at Tyke's house...hmmm I wonder why?!!!!!).  The three lovely ladies Haras Relda, Purdy McHot, and Mandy Moneymaker all made their exits prematurely unfortunately.  But this is how it goes when you have boyfriends or when you get sick.  Tyke didn't really know if they left because they didn't feel good or what.  Really though it doesn't matter.  Onside kick game was fun but Kinker is way too good at it.  Tyke is the only one who has a chance at beating him but really he doesn't either.  Oh yeah and Tyke's DDR outfit is really unmatchable.  Like this outfit is so hot it could burn the pants off a 4 year old girl (ewww by the way).  Wow that was a disturbing image.  And yet strangely arousing (haha).  The party got a little more reserved later and basically turned into Dr. Phil Lelee telling some great stories and then Tyke telling about his feelings for Tina and all.  That was fun.  Well it made him miss her more.  He pretended that she was there but in reality it was just two pillows he was holding while laying alone on the couch.  That is sort of a sad, yet funny, picture.  And at the same time strangely arousing...well this TY-ger's eyes are starting to hurt because he has been up a long time and been playing an endless amount of DDR.  But ladies do not forget...Tyke is on the prowl...pretty gay prowl...but he is hoping, nay searching hard for that one girl, that special girl, the girl he wants to spend the rest of his life (make that year) with.  Bye.  I love you all.  Not really.  A lot of you I am really only acquaintances with but some of you I hope to love soon and the others well you are alright.  Maybe we can hang out sometime.  Or talk online.  IM me whenever because it is always comforting to know that someone cares and wants to talk.  Once again...Bye.  :)

      What a day what a day!  Started off nice and normal.  Ya know how it is...Dodging falling limbs and crazy maniacs driving on the road with traffic lights out.  Yeah, Tyke almost got hit by a falling branch today on the way to school.  It wouldn't have killed him and probably wouldn't have done too too much damage but it probably would've injured him.  Luckily he saw it and managed to avoid it.  He is a really lucky guy, for the most part.  Then at school the wind was really strong at one point and it was tough to walk.  Normally it is fun when that happens but not when you are carrying a gay book and your hair isn't dry and you are walking into a car.  But anyway since school was cancelled Tyke just got up and jettered out to join the Irish Setter in the yard (allusion to this quilt-like thing Tyke's mom made and it was up at his old house but he doubts that anyone would know it).  So the entire gang all went their separate ways and then on the way home Macaroon called Tyke so he went up to his house.  Skippy, Kinker, and Amed joined in.  They played football outside Macaroon's house at 8:39 in the AM!!!!!  HOW SWEET IS THAT!!!!!  It was incredibly fun.  Then they went inside and watched MXC and listened to Tyke's Uber (not my word) Mix.  After the CD was completado they went downstairs and played DDR.  Tyke was off and he just pretty much got owned by the wireless glow in the dark pads Macaroon busted out.  But he still did pretty well.  Then they played Halo which is always and I mean always fun.  That was a blast.  Then Skippy left and Tyke got out the multi-tap and the gang played Madden with 4 people and then 5 when Amed came.  That game is insanely fun too.  Shawn Springs as a TE.  What an idea that was!!!!!  Then the gang played some more Halo and went out to Factoria to get some lunch at BK.  This didn't happen cuz there was no power at the Factoria Mall.  But since there wasn't power there weren't cars either.  So Tyke, Dr. Phil Lelee, Kinker, and Macaroon played such a great game of parking lot football.  Then Amed joined in.  That was fun.  But then they got hungry so they went over to Subway for "lunch."  After that they took a rather circuitous route home which was fun.  Tyke made an obstacle course with the debris on the road.  First time he went over it he lost and scraped his car.  But the second time he OWNED the road!!!  Then they went back to McGee's and played more Halo.  What a fun game.  And then Tyke left a little later.  He came home and did his lit term.  Then he made up some really funny definitions to flash cards for Gov.  Hehehehe.  Those things are so pointless yet so funny to make up things.  Now he is listening to some good music from over the summer.  Brand New is on now.  Call me a safe bet...I'm betting I'm not.  Glad that you could forget.  Only hoping as time goes you can forget.

      Man, Tyke has such great taste in music.  It is incredible.  If only he were better at playing some instrument, or singing, or even if he was a better song writer.  He is a decent song writer but really he isn't very good.  It is hard to write a song.  You have to concentrate.  Tyke wrote a full song once.  It was pretty good.  Well maybe not but it was decent.  He has made some stabs at writing in the past but really only one full song.  Today was another pretty normal but not too exciting day for Tyke.  1st period consisted of making up names for children and changing current names.  Tina and Karla and Tyke were the only ones thinking about this but it was really funny.  It really was.  Hilarious at times.  And what if you could just start putting accents on letters in your name?  Like say if your name was Chris and you put the accent over like the H or the R.  That would be sick.  Or if you were just like, "Yeah, my name is Chris but my friends call me H."  (Cuz the accent is on the H and then they only say that letter...well it doesn't make sense if you weren't there at the time but it was funny then)  Baby names are kinda fun to think about too.  2nd period was not important enough to talk about.  3rd period was pretty much the same.  4th period Tyke and Purdy talked about baby names some more.  Lunch stupid except Tyke played his insanely sick mix.  Eh, it is fun to listen to at least.  But some people apparently don't like techno.  Purdy said she thought it was stupid.  But if that is true then why does she have fun playing DDR???  ANSWER ME THAT!!!  5th period pointless.  6th period was kinda fun cuz they talked about attraction and stuff.  And think about this one: What if all people that you had no attraction to you would repel from when you went to touch them?  And then the person that you were "supposed to be with" was the opposite of you or whatever so when you went to touch them you wouldn't repel so you could touch him/her.  Then you would know who your mate would be!  How cool would that be!!!  What is love?  Baby don't hurt me.  Don't hurt me.  No more.  (bob head and repeat)

      First off the thing mentioned a few days ago about nice guys is wrong.  At least according to some people.  And Tyke now agrees.  Whatever, people will say what they want (whatever that means).  Nothing much to say for once.  That is probably cuz Tyke is not thinking about girls.  Friday should be fun.  Just cuz it is the beginning of the weekend.  Oh yeah and also Tyke is making a new cd but the stupid computer messed up twice when burning it so now he is out of cds so he has to go to Target to get that and film after going to dinner tonight and then he is going to the basketball game tonight with Purdy and Skippy.

      So here is the deal regarding Tyke and Tina.  Tyke decided that he is going to try and no longer think about how much he wants to be with Tina or even try and see if there is any chance for the two to become an item.  This is not saying that he does not still have feelings for her and that he is going to try and get over her.  It just means he is going to try and be just friends with her.  If Tina and Kram break up though...then it is a whole new story.  But right now at least, Tyke is looking for a new girl.  Ladies beware cuz this TY-ger is on the prowl!  Grrr

      For the most part Saturday was a pretty boring day for Tyke.  He had to get up at 8 to go to his Uncle's house in Quilcene (on Bainbridge Island).  It was really boring as talking to his grandmother is sorta like listening to his grandmother until there is an ever so tiny hole in her speech and then he gets to throw in some idea.  And also she has ideas that he finds ridiculous but then again she is family.  Tyke left his Uncle's house at about 6:20 because 35 minutes earlier his mom said that they weren't going to be able to catch the 7:10 ferry and then since the next one didn't leave until 8:10 they might as well just wait longer to leave.  Of course this was a bad decision so even though they ended up leaving 35 minutes later than planned they still missed the ferry by just 6 minutes!!!  So they had to wait almost an hour just to catch the next ferry.  On driving home Tyke saw some wicked cool fog in the Bellevue, Eastgate, Issaquah area.  It was really cool looking.  Then he got home about 9 and right away left to go to Macaroon's house and Dr. Phil Lelee was there too.  They played Madden and it was really really fun.  He left at about midnight and then nobody was online so he went to bed.  It was fun listening to music all day but of course the music he was listening to reminded him of things he didn't really want to think about...

      Tyke is back, back again.  Friday was awesome.  1st period was easy and nothing really.  2nd period was easy.  Then the assembly which was wickedly good.  Awesome job by Tank with his "balls" joke and calling that guy a girl.  Then after the assembly the fire alarm got pulled so everyone didn't have to go back to class.  Then in 3rd period there was no test like there was supposed to be so they just played a game and Tyke was the LEADER of the game and he made his own rules and was a Nazi about enforcing them.  In 4th period Purdy helped to get them out of class 15 minutes early without the teacher knowing so Tyke, etc. went to Burger King for a nice long lunch.  It was great.  5th period was nothing and 6th period was pretty good.  After school Tyke stayed after to help put up decorations for the Senior Class' hallway.  It was pretty fun even though he got yelled at 2ice.  First by Ms. McGinnis and then by Ms. Foote because he had the key to open all of the doors to the school and probably wasn't supposed to.  BUT IT WAS SOOOO COOL!  Haras was hanging up decorations and stuff too but unfortunately she and Tyke didn't really talk much.  Mainly cuz Tyke and Purdy left early and went up to Farget's.  It was cool just hanging out and shopping a little.  Then Purdy went home and Tyke came home and did some cleaning and played Madden.  Then Macaroon, Amed, Flamingo, and Skippy came over and they played Halo and Madden.  Halo is still so much fun to play.  Halo 2 with 4-player cooperative is going to be perhaps the coolest thing ever.  And then 16 person online will be sick too.  But so would a really cool girl to hang out with.  That would be very cool too.  Like maybe Tina.  Her senior picture is soooooooooooooooo good.  It is on Tyke's monitor and it really makes him weak looking at it.  She is so beautiful and angelic.  So sweet and innocent.  So perfect.  But that is not possible.  Perfection is imperfect.  And hopefully Tyke isn't just hoping that she is the girl he wants her to be but who knows right now.  And really it doesn't matter because right now there is nothing between them so there is nothing to worry about.  Life is good.  Goodnight all.

      Hello all you Tyke-heads out there in Tyke Land.  This is Tyke Turner for ya.  Thursday was pretty fun.  It involved not doing too much at school and then chilling at night.  After school Tyke decided to go to the Sly Lion boys bball game at Sly Lion.  He felt bad for not going to Friends night at Dottie's because he said he was going to but he likes basketball better and he didn't think that anybody was going to Friends.  But he still felt really bad.  The game was fun though and pretty intense for being between Sly Lion and "inner-city bellevue."  Unfortunately Sly Lion won but it was a fun game to go to.  Tyke just hung out with Purdy, Mandy, and Tig'Ol for the game and talked to Ekul's parents cuz he hasn't talked to them in FOREVER!!!  So it was a fun night.  But then after the game the Sly Lion boys were back with Tyke's friends so he decided that he didn't really feel like being a 5th wheel so he just went on home instead of hanging out with them.  But it's cool cuz he still had fun the rest of the night.  Well, that is really all that happened today but tomorrow there is an assembly!  Yippy Skippy!  I mean Toodles Tyke!

      Hi, this is Tyke Turner if you didn't know.  Let me tell you about my day today, Wednesday.  It was pretty good because Tyke got to sleep in until after 8 because of wickedly awesome late start Wednesdays.  School was pretty stupid as usual but whatever...ONLY 7 MORE SCHOOL DAYS UNTIL BREAK!!!  After school Tykie came home and just chilled by himself which is getting kinda boring now but whatever cuz ONLY 7 MORE DAYS UNTIL BREAK!!!!  Later on he went to the Winter Concert and watched Haras sing.  The performances were really quite good.  A pleasant change from the ordinary is a fitting description of the event.  Purdy and Tig 'Ol were there but so were Ekul and Haras' Kram.  So Tyke and Skippy of course sat behind them instead of with them.  Then they would try to talk to either Purdy and Tig 'Ol and they just weren't listening so they decided they would get some revenge.  So they stole their purses and Purdy's sweatshirt (hahahahaha Tyke admits it, he stole it hahahahaha) and then Tyke tied Ekul's keychain to his chair so when he stood up the chair came with him!  Oh that was great!  But really, Ekul is a good guy.  Tyke doesn't really know Kram number 2 but he is probably a good guy too.  Must be to be dating Haras.  The Sly Lion guys are alright but they certainly aren't like the INDIANS.  Or at least Tyke and Skippy.  Tyke and Skippy are in a league of their own.  Not the movie League of their Own, just a figurative league of their own.  So yeah, basically another night of Tyke and Skippy just having fun with each other (and none of that gay fun that some guys have...this was some good old fashioned clean straight fun)  Oh yeah and Tyke and Skippy ARE NOT the same person.  So stop pretending like they only hang out with each other.  They don't have to consult each other on everything and they are not always hanging out!  They are just friends.  Yeesh, some people...

      Hello folks.  Tyke and Tuesday go together pretty well.  I mean first off they both start with T so they already have alliteration going for them.  And alliteration attacks all!!!  (haha I am so funny because I used alliteration to say that last sentence...unbelievable!)  But seriously folks, Tuesday was good.  Tyke had Sub-Dub day (two subsititutes) which is always a bonus.  And right now a really good song is playing which makes Tyke in a better mood for writing this which means when he reflects upon what he was doing during the day he remembers more of the good then the bad.  Ahh yes, Tina.  Well today guess what she talked to Tyke about?  Yeah that's right...THIS BLOG!!!!!!  Well that almost got awkward.  No she has not read this, yet at least.  But she was like, "so I hear that you have a website?" and he was like, "ummm yeah who'd ya hear that from?" and she said Purdy and then asked what it was about.  And he was like, "you mean the url, address, or just what it was about?" and luckily she just wanted to know what it was about.  So he told her it was just his life and interesting stories and that he made up names and then he told her all the names.  But this was kind of a relief for him that she hasn't read these words he posts.  Because that could make a very very very very very awkward situation.  At first when he started the site he didn't think he would mind if she read it and he kinda wanted her to but after this scare it probably would be a bad thing to do.  Things are pretty good as they are and since he knows that all he is hoping for with her right now is a friendship if she reads the site and gets freaked out then he could lose her friendship and that would be awful.  Well, all for now because this is starting to be the opposite of happy.  Who let the dogs out?  TYKE DID!!!!!!!!

      Hi fans.  Tyke is just getting overwhelmed with all of the fan mail and such that he has been receiving.  This little Japanese girl even sent him her home phone number.  How weird is that???  Well this day was really not that blogworthy but Tyke must talk everyday and share his ever-so-exciting life with the viewing public.  Eh, this is gay so whatever.  Today was a good Monday.  English was awesome cuz Tyke and Fejj Fish-head sang "Fuck Her Gently" in class.  They blasted Tenacious D and just started singing along.  It was one hell of a moment.  The whole class just started cracking up.  If you have heard the song you would know why.  And then after school Tyke made the 2-CD compilation of great love songs.  It is a keeper indeed.  Ask him for a copy and you may be so lucky to receive what you want.  But be careful what you wish for.  You never know what may be lurking on the other side of the door.  This blog will be closed with the joke of the day: How do you make a hormone?      YOU DON'T PAY HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG THAT IS SOOOO GOOOD!!!!

      Today was a pretty good Sunday.  Tyke woke up a little before noon and just layed in bed for a while.  He took a shower and just kinda lounged for most of the day.  He did have some cake though.  It is good cake.  Anybody want some?  His mom left for San Jose until Friday so now it is just him and his dad til then.  That should be interesting.  Probably going to be a quiet house for that time.  Poor Tyke had a headache all day so at about 4 he took a nap and that made it go away.  Then he woke up and nobody was home.  That is a weird situation.  When you fall asleep with people home and then get up and like you yell, "Hey Justin (or whatever your siblings name may be)" and since nobody is there, there is no answer.  So he just lounged around more.  Then he got online and popped in Love Songs for Landreth and listened to that.  Great CD.  It started quite a little mood change when it was first introduced to the public.  Tyke and Skippy felt pretty lonely back in those days.  Times have changed but they still are not real happy with their situations.  But now Tyke is going to be making a Christmas CD and that is going to be real good for him.  And also he is going to make a CD for Haras because she loves getting CD's and Tyke loves to please.  He talked to Haras online for the first time today.  She is really cool.  They have been friends forever.  Like since 1st grade.  That is a long time.  I Melt is playing right now.  That is a great song too.  I meeeeeeeeellllllllt every time you look at me that way.  Tyke is going to make videos over this winter break.  That is going to be soooo much fun.  Music videos would be so cool to do.  So to close Tyke would like to say hello to Skippy, Macaroon, Tyronius, Tina, Purdy, Mandy, Karla, Dottie, Haras, Kinker, Amed, Commander Cool, and all of the other members of The Twisted Tales of Tyke Turner and Skippy McPipe/Obsessive Stories About Tyke and Tina because you are the people that keep this little life of his exciting, pleasant, happy, and worth living.  Without you his life would be nothing.  This one's for you ;).

      Tyke's house gets used sooo much it is awesome.  Friday night was the surprise party with about 15 people or so all in the downstairs drinking and dancing.  Then on Saturday night the guys came over for Halo and Madden.  The recycling can is so full.  Wow, like 50 bottles of pop in there.  Soooo many.  Haha, but what house is the party house?  Tyke's house!!!  This was a good night for Tyke just chilling with the guys.  Well and the Trew-fanator came over as well with Tyronius but still just a night with the guys.  And on a side note, to update the search for a girl for Tyke...well the search is trudging along.  No accomplishments have been made yet and really everyday has been exactly the same as the last but still, only time will tell.  Tyke will leave you with a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, hey guess what? I want to hump you.  (wow that is sooooo bad--in more than one way)

      Saturday came and went faster than you can shake a stick at it.  Tyke got up late and all and then hardly did anything before leaving for KING 5 again.  This time his mentor was doing the NWCN Northwest Sports Tonight show.  So he got there about 5 and they were already working on the show putting together clips and stories, etc.  Well once the Sonics game rolled around at 6 Tyke got put to work.  He logged the game which just means he watched the game and marked down the time of special plays and the score and other things having to do with the game.  So that kept him busy for about 2 and a half hours.  Then after that he did some more tasks for the 2 guys doing the show.  These tasks included just searching for stuff and finding stats and such for games happening during the day.  Then when his mentor was ready they compiled the Sonics game information and Tyke told him the clips to use and helped write what he was gonna say for the show.  So the Sonics highlight was hugely a Tyke Turner masterpiece.  This is really fun.  He is finding out that this career really is for him and that he is also pretty good at it from what he can tell.  Tyke could go back tomorrow if he wanted, and his mom is pretty vehement about him doing so, but Tyke wants to just take a day off and try and not have his vacation go by too quickly.  Already a day has gone by and he didn't see any friends.  And he hasn't hung out with any girls in a while either.  So that is tops on his agenda.  Laters gators.

      Well, this will be the blog for Friday night even though it is almost 2 on Saturday.  Well, Friday was alright at school for Tyke but after school is when he got busy.  He got home and changed for his first CE appointment at KING 5.  He then drove all the way to Seattle and to the Phi Kappa Psi frat house for his first meeting.  He met his mentor there (sports reporter/anchor Michael King) as they were doing a story on this world-class weightlifter from Newport High School who goes to UW.  He works out in the basement of his frat house which is an interesting story and the reason for KING 5's dedicating a story just to this.  Well this guy weighs 165 pounds and can dead lift (just pick up really) 550 pounds and benches 300 or so.  Those numbers may not seem like a lot but he only weighs 165 pounds.  Tyke has got a good couple of inches on him but is not nearly as ripped as him.  So they did the story on him and then when Michael was doing the "teaser" (the little clip that introduces the upcoming story when the news program is going to commercial) they decided to put Tyke to work.  First they just had him in the background shooting pool while Michael did the story.  Then they did some different shots and they had Tyke just playing along with Michael while he did the promo.  So whenever this story is played on-air Tyke should be on it.  Not a big part but its still cool.  Today he is gonna go back there and maybe help out some more with the NWCN sports broadcast tonight.  It should be a fun CE, especially cuz it has nothing to do with his actual topic.  Well then Tyke got home last night and went to the boys basketball game and then he came back home with some guys and they went and played midnight bball up at Sunny Hills.  Then they came back home and played some poker.  Then he went to sleep and woke up after 1 PM today.  That is pretty late for him.  But he does have ALL BREAK to sleep.  Whoo hoo!

      Masquerade!  La-di-da-di-da-di-da!  Blah blah blah!  Good song.  Anyway today is THURSDAY!  TOMORROW IS FRIDAY!!!  SCHOOL GETS OUT TOMORROW FOR BREAK!!!  TOMORROW!!!!!!  Well now it is hard to write about anything.  So this will probably be boring.  But today after school Tyke talked with some people and ate some 3 hour old Mexi-fries which had a weird taste to them but he trudged on and ate it.  Then he went home and did some hw (omeork) and that was cool.  Haha that was funny.  By the way, Haras is amazing.  And sooo great.  Not to mention the fact that she is my favorite.  Now that says a lot.  Cuz believe you me, if you did not know I am easily a 13 on the Ladies Man scale (size of scale omitted on purpose).  Anyway, Tyke got sidetracked.  He went to Party 4 Less after dinner and then to gymnastics.  He played a couple great games of Apple Ball before leaving.  This is almost time to stop.  Get well Haras should be said.  She might not be feeling well.  (sad face).  night all.

      Eh.  Well today was pretty boring.  Late start was cool and then after school was "Gingerbread" house making.  That was alright and it was at least tasty.  Skippy, Tyke, Macaroon, and Samantha worked together for theirs.  It was wicked awesome but then it fell apart so they scratched that and just made a swimming pool filled with frosting and little bits of stuff.  Mmmmmm...frosting.  Soooo good.  After that Tyke went to Farget to get his mom a Bette Midler CD.  Probably not the one she wanted but that is the beauty of returns/exchanges.  Well then he got home and then it got gay.  He did absolutely nothing all night except for play Madden for a little while.  He then got so bored that he studied for math!?!?!?!  What the hell is wrong with him?  Why would he do that?  Well then he popped in the Phantom of the Opera CD.  That was such a cool opera/musical/whatever it technically was.  Like the chandelier falling was wicked cool.  He was only like 8 when he saw it but it was probably cool anyway.  Classical music is way underrated also.  Like there is tons of music that is very very good but people don't listen to it cuz it is classical.  Cum on peeps, get wit it.  He also sometimes is in the mood to listen to Andrea Bocelli or Josh Groban.  One of the best songs, though, is Pachelbel's Canon/Kanon in D/Variations on the Canon.  When Tyke was 2 he would put on headphones and listen to that.  Then he would get a latil (sp) and close his eyes and sit in his rocking chair and pretend he was the conductor.  Those memories make him smile.  And how he use to call himself Fer-Fer because of the last part of Christopher.  And how much he loved deer.  Bambi was a great movie.  He had deer at his old house and he saw them frequently so he and his mom named them.  There was Spike, Faline, and Fer-Fer.  And the bears that came around would always eat the dandelions and then there was that time when there was a pheasant and his dog saw it outside and went berserk in the downstairs and just started running around and screaming.  And when he would tape songs from the radio and then make up dances for them when his extended family came over.  One time he threw off his hat into the crowd and nailed his aunt in the eye.  But she was ok.  Life really was simpler back then.  He worried more but that was just how he felt.  Little things would get him worried.  Like for about a week in elementary school he missed school and then the night before he was supposed to come back he got really scared about having to make up all the work he missed or not even getting a chance to.  That was just silly.  And relationships were simpler too.  Even though he certainly didn't feel that way then now he knows they were.  Like when he had a thing for Karla he would get sad when she didn't like him back.  Same for Haras but that was in 5th grade mainly.  He can still remember this one time when he told Haras that he wasn't going to like her anymore and she got happy and gave him a high five.  He felt really good about that and then when they were walking out to recess Tyke was walking with Stuart behind Haras and her friends and he saw her shoelace was untied so he told her.  And then she sorta snapped back "I thought you didn't care."  That taught him to speak to her!  Hahaha just kidding cuz Haras is one of the nicest people Tyke has known but she really did say all that to him.  Oh well, times change.  People grow.  People drift.  People grow closer.  People have a baby.  People grow closer to baby.  People grow up.  People grow apart from "baby."  People die.  "Baby" continues cycle.  (I have absolutely no idea what sparked those last remarks but whatever, I am crazy)

      Tuesdays after school are awesome.  Since the next day, some call it Wednesday, is a "late start" day sleeping can be pushed back some time and still feel nice and refreshed.  It is one of those things where you just can't lose.  Unless you die.  Then you lose.  But anyway today was pretty cool.  After school Tyke and Skippy went to Teddy's and got like 750 candy canes for gingerbread houses tomorrow.  Then they went home.  Upon arrival of Tyke into his home his madre told him that he got a call from KING5 about his mentorship thingy.  To cut the long story down to make it short, he is doing it there.  So...cool.  But really the story of the day involves a very large man and a semi-large but really normal big sized man.  Anyway coming back to lunch today Tyke walked into the commons and Dean (BIG) and Sweeney (Macka) called Tyke over to talk to them.  BIG told him he should come to the Senior Trip meeting tonight but Tyke told him he was unavailable.  Then Macka started talking to him about another issue.  He said that Tyke should start going out with Tina.  Then he said that he should start to rub it in the face of Kram.  Then when Kram gets mad at Tyke, BIG and Macka would have a reason to kill Kram.  Thats right.  Not just beat up but kill.  So Tyke was like, ok sweet!  Then they saw Tina so the guys told Tyke to go talk to her so he was going to anyway so he did.  Then Kram walked by and just kinda walked right by sorta and then Tyke kept talking and then when Tyke left Kram came back over to Tina.  This was one of the greatest/funniest moments ever!  It was incredible.  Haha...so now Tyke has people on his side for him and Tina.  Now he only needs Tina.  Eh, damn that is the hard part.  LET THE OPERATION BEGIN!  Oh yeah and also today...Tyke went to his soccer party and he got some sick Superman outfit that is for little kids and he put on the shirt and it fits enough to be worn but it is insanely wickedly tight on him even.  So then he put his cape on and his headband and took some pictures of him flying.  Yeah, that is gonna be cool, Commander Cool.  Kinker, Macaroon, Tyronius.  Good names.  Haras, Purdy, Mandy, Dottie, Tina, Amed, Skippy, Dolores, etc.  Good names.  Go people!

      Monday.  That was today.  Another Monday is in the books though.  And that means that break is only 4 days away!  How sick is that?  Pretty sick I would say.  But anyway today was a good day for Tyke.  He and Tina talked at school as usual and that is always fun.  She's a great gal.  Then after school Tyke and Skippy just tossed around the foot in the parking lot which is a lot of fun to do.  Especially when you drill somebody's car.  OOPS!  But then Tyke came home and did a little homework and then was just so tired that he took a nap.  He ended up getting about 30 minutes in before his alarm went off for him to get up and finish his english essay.  So he got up and did that.  It was easier than he thought.  Then he left to go to Karaoke night but since he had to take care of his own dinner because it is his parents' anniversary he decided to go to JIB.  Nobody went with him but it was cool.  On the way there he heard his phone ring.  So he looked down at the ID and guess who it said?  OK, seriously guess before you look.  Done guessing?  Are ya?  Are ya?  Ok cool.  Well yeah, it was TINA!  She called him out of the blue which was wicked cool.  Like totally unexpected and this was the first time he ever called his cell.  Once, maybe twice, she called his house phone but never his cell.  It was awesome.  But she just wanted to tell him that she wasn't coming to Karaoke night like she said she was going to.  Then she asked him what he was doing and he said he was going to dinner.  So she asked who was with him and he said nobody.  Then she asked who he was meeting there and he said nobody.  And then she seemed like, "oh, ummm coool."  Oh well at least he is coooooool enough to go out to dinner on a Monday night by himself!  So HA!  But anyway they talked for a little and (*sigh, Tyke just kinda smiled just now and reminisced about that phone call) well yeah that was a really good way to start off his drive.  So after that he was in a really good mood.  He went to JIB and the service was quite slow but because he was in such a good mood he didn't mind at all.  Oh yeah, and he was listening to AAR for the night ride too so that was cool cuz he hasn't popped that CD in for a while.  But then he got to the school and called Skippy and told him about the phone call and then he went in and ate.  He talked with Haras a little and Dottie too.  Dottie is really cool.  AND SINGLE TOO (wink wink)!  So anyway the night started off with a BANGING rendition of the one and only pool table song.  Well it isn't really the only but still it is the best of them.  Haras and Purdy and Mandy and Dottie and Tig'Ol were all in it and it was very entertaining.  Mandy and Tig'Ol did another song later and that was very good too, good enough to win 1st place in fact.  But really, the show-stopping number belonged to Skippy and Tyke.  They were like, we need to do a song so they picked out one which fit them perfectly.  Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely by Backstreet Boys of course.  They pulled in a couple other guys to do it with them and it was stunning.  Tyke did a nice little strip tease as usual and basically got naked.  Well not really at all but he threw off Haras' scarf and his hat and his little jacket thing.  He poured his heart out into that song.  And he felt a good reaction came from the crowd.  Well anyway they got second place and this blog is really long so that means it is time...to...stop...writing...but it is fun to write.  But yeah, tonight was a good night.  Nothing like Sunday was.  Man, that day sucked.  Ok bye.

      Sorry for those of you who have liked the blogs of past days and hated the ones that were depressing but Tyke is in one of those moods now.  Sunday was not a good day.  Tyke has been in relatively good moods for quite some time now but really he has just been pushing down his true feelings.  He is hurting and wants someone to help ease the pain.  It is cool having friends who are willing to do so and they really are good friends but they can't fill the void that needs filling.  Tyke needs a "one."  A girl that is not dating anyone.  A girl that is not interested in another guy.  A girl that is interested in Tyke.  A girl that has the same void in her life that only Tyke can fill.  Tyke needs a girlfriend.  It is as simple as that.  The problem is that it is not this easy to do.  Just because you want a girlfriend and are looking for one does not mean that one will come.  Obviously Tyke is interested in Tina.  She is who Tyke most wants to be with but that has not, and from the looks of it will not be happening.  But he is not so "obsessed" with her as he was in the past.  She is a great girl but probably not the girl for him.  So that means he has to think about other girls.  Well, he first looks to the girls he is friends with.  And he thinks "Yeah, I like them and they are great.  I can see myself with any one of them."  He spends most of his time with them and they seem to have an interest in him.  But then he realizes that also cannot happen.  They are all already taken.  So what is next?  He isn't meeting any new girls anywhere so who else is there to be with?  Does he have to wait until college?  That seems like so long away.  All of the girls in his life that he wants he cannot have.  Does he want them because he cannot have them?  Hopefully not.  That would be a disaster if it were true.  But Sunday has always been a day of reflection for him.  He just wants this stupid situation to be taken care of.  He often thinks about how stupid he sounds being sad or lonely or longing or whatever.  But then he just gets into one of those moods and he can't stop himself from just talking about his feelings.  Life is hard enough without the troubles associated with the opposite sex.  The problem with the way he feels is that it is so fluctuating.  Because of his nature, one minute he is with girls like Tina and Purdy and Haras and Mandy and Dottie and he feels soo good about himself.  But then in just a moment he remembers why he was feeling bad before and goes back to that feeling.  It is a cycle that has its highs and lows but the lows seem to last longer than the highs.  He wonders also if he is so disturbed as to actually enjoy feeling sorry for himself and his situation and thus perpetuate this horrible feeling over and over again.  It hurts to be in it but then he writes here and he thinks that he is just trying to get pity for himself.  Which has been true in the past and will probably, at times, be true in the future.  But this is not right.  He should not be so messed up as to need to have the pity of others to feel good about himself.  Why should anyone pity him?  What is really so bad about his life?  So he doesn't have a girlfriend?  So what?  How bad is that really in the scheme of life?  He has a house, friends, brains, and a very bright future.  But he just continues to wallow in this pit.  Someday, hopefully in the near future, all will be resolved but until then, Goodbye.

      CHRIS SABO!!!!  Saturday was a decent day.  A pretty short one though for Tyke because he got up at about 12:30.  Then he found out he had a haircut in like 30 minutes so he got ready quickly and went to that.  Then he went to Farget and got a present for his dad.  1/3 of his family shopping is done now.  Then he went home and played Madden and won 17-16 in a very great comeback.  Then he killed time and watched MXC couples edition.  That was absolutely hilarious.  The part where on the Romantic Rotating Surfboard of Death the guy tried to like push his girl on the surfboard and then she fell and just toppled over backwards into the water was soooooo very funny.  Insanely funny.  So then later he went over to Kinker's house and then Dr. Phil Lelee and Macaroon came over too.  First they played Madden and made themselves really good but they still sucked.  Then Amed and Skippy came over and they played Halo.  They also played Foosball but Amed was pretty good at that.  Not at Halo though.  In the team tourney they made up Tyke and Dr. Phil Lelee tied with Macaroon (Amed was on his team but really did almost nothing but not die...haha jk Amed you aren't the worst player ever) and that was a lot of fun.  Then he pretty much went home and blogged.  But on the way home he saw a Medina cop in Issaquah.  What is up with that?  Isn't Medina like Seattle?  Why would there be a Medina cop driving in Issaquah?  Maybe it was stolen.  Yeah, musta been it.  And the guy in the cop car was just trying to be like in Vice City where he would kill people and stuff.  Ahhh, good times.  NEATO!

      Ahhh, days just keep going by.  It is already Saturday.  Gotta start doing something productive over this break.   HA!  Are you kidding me?  Tyke had another pretty good day.  Played some games with his bro for most of the day and went over to Macaroon's for an hour or so.  Played some games there with his bro.  It was pretty cool.  Then helped out the fam with some stuff.  Then just waited til people came over to par-tay.  Once they got here it was off the hook!  First, Macaroon, Amed, and Tyke did some filming of the three of them.  It was pretty funny.  Then Skippy joined them and they did another video.  It was one of them just sitting around and talking (Tyke was doing the filming though).  But it was great because they talked about the most random shit.  It was hilarious.  So they watched that.  Then they played Halo.  Then they got food at Mickey D's and they talked about not getting mad cow disease and stuff with the server guy.  Of course he was going all pro-McDonald's and "Ooooo, we don't have mad cow.  We have our own cows.  Mrah, there is chlorine in the water.  Mrah!"  Well that was cool.  Then they went to the Fred Meyer parking lot to play football of course.  Tyke videotaped them and he had to get some tape of Amed throwing cuz that is classic.  And then him dancing too.  Then they got in the car and they taped Amed dancing and singing to "I Like the Way You Moooooove."  That was funny.  Then they got home and Dr. Phil called em up and he came over later while they were playing more Halo.  So then they all got dressed up and did a little music video to "I Like the Way You Move."  It was very good and a little funny.  But really it was just a serious music video that with the right editing could win an award of some sort.  It is really classy stuff.  Nothing but the highest quality.  Deserving of a viewing to say the least.  Tomorrow (today) will hopefully be more of the same so this should be a blast!

      Christmas was fun!  Tyke got his new videocamera.  It isn't perfect as it is kinda hard to use just because of the structure of it.  You hold it like a camera more than you would a regular videocamera.  But it is digital and it gets the job done.  So he loves getting to make movies and, hopefully, his friends will actually be free tomorrow so he can make some movies with them.  He hasn't talked to anybody in quite some time.  And hopefully things went well for Skippy.  Tyke hasn't actually gotten to talk to Skippy about whatever happened but he is assuming it is good.  As long as Skippy is happy, that is good.  And today was fun for Tyke so, it was good.  This can hopefully be a good omen for things to come.  Maybe things will get better now and Tyke can have a fun last 100 days of high school.  The days are ticking by quickly.  Graduation is not far off.  And college too will be on everybody sooner than they can believe.  People will split and drift and some others will get closer.  But most importantly, Tyke will get to meet some fine new ladies.  There is nothing more important than that (SOOOOO JOKING!)  Short but sweet tonight.  Not enough to blog about for now.  To the Gods!  (Adios!)

      Not sure if it is the vodka left in his system from the Cosmopolitan he had tonight or what but Tyke is in a better mood now.  Christmas is just 35 minutes away and he has already made like 100 bucks or so.  Tyke's cousins and aunt and uncle from South Cove came up along with his aunt and uncle who live in Spokane/a houseboat in Seattle.  It was good to just not have to think about anything at all other than just looking smart in front of all of the smart people in his family.  But basically it was good for Tyke to not think about his former situation and to realize that it really is not as important or as pressing of an issue as he could make it out to be.  Sure it is difficult but of course he will be fine with a little bit of time.  And now he is better.  Not perfect but he is at least finding that there is a little bit of humor in it all.  Well, sorta.  But as great as she is, she is not the one.  So he picks himself up, dusts himself off, and moves on to the next lady.  Which will probably not be until college.  High school/middle school/elementary school weren't the right place for Tyke to meet a girl so college should be.  At least it should be.  Tyke's taking another dive.  Let's hope he finds some water somewhere.  Once again, a Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.  Happy holidays all!

      Starting with the next post, names will return to how they were in previous posts.  Today has been pretty much a continuation of last night.  I am in an odd daze.  It doesn't hurt as much as it did last night but it still feels lousy.  I mean, it is good that I finally have a definite answer and all of this is resolved but it doesn't take away from how I feel.  It is just like I am waiting to have that sigh of relief where I know everything is over.  But that hasn't happened yet.  Soon, though.  Soon it will happen.  But for now I will still think about her.  It doesn't help me to do that and I know it but I don't really want to stop myself, at least yet.  But it is time to stop feeling bad and just pick myself up.  It's not like we were going out for the last 4 years anyway.  I got dumped without going out with her ever.  And I still have her as a friend.  So for now it is tough.  In the future it can hopefully be better.  The only thing I know that can make this feeling go away is to be in the company of another that I feel an attraction to or at least feel comfortable with.  The problem is that I need to find this person first.  Merry Christmas!

      Well, it's over.  Yeah, done with.  No more Tyke and Tina.  No chance of it happening in this lifetime.  She called me back.  It was 8:03 PM on Tuesday, December 23, 2003.  The time my heart finally got shattered.  We talked for 9 minutes and 52 seconds.  She called me from her house phone.  Right from when I answered it was awkward.  She asked me about my CE and then we talked about that for a little.  Then she got to the letter.  She told me she was blown away.  Absolutely blown away.  It was nothing she had expected.  People had told her that I had a crush on her but she never expected it to be this much.  And then she just flat out said that we are friends and nothing more.  She cannot think of me that way.  It is troubling for her but it is true.  I am a great guy but not for her.  And I will be honest with you.  This fucking hurt.  Bam!  I like you but not like that is all I could think about.  I am not the guy for her.  Then we talked about other things like how she wanted to know what she could do and she kept asking me what she could do.  But there is absolutely nothing she could do.  I only wanted one thing.  She couldn't give it to me so it wouldn't be enough for her to do anything else.  Of course she wants to stay friends.  Great friends.  And she hopes, actually she commands, that we do not make it awkward.  She told me that we would not talk about it.  We can't make it awkward.  She wanted to make sure that she wasn't leading me on or being a tease.  I assured her she wasn't.  Then we just tried to resume our normal relationship.  She wanted to make sure that I wasn't going to become anti-Kaley but how can I do that?  Just because she will never love me doesn't mean that I am going to automatically stop loving her.  I am still going to come to her bball games and make her signs if I can.  But nothing will ever come of that.  So we will be friends.  And nothing more.  It hurts.  So bad.  I can't tell you what this is like.  The pain is almost unbearable but I know I have to start up with my normal actions again.  She is still a part of me but I just have to get over it.  I put my heart out and got rejected.  So now I must take this closure and grow from it.  This has to be a learning experience for me.  Hopefully it won't make me timid or anything like that.  I need to stay strong.  Damnit, how?  Why?  Damnit.  It hurts.  What do I do from here?  How will it become normal again?  I can't continue with this.  I need to get out of here.  Hopefully I can get some time away from things at Unger's.  Ok, here I go.  My first step on a new path for me.  My life will be different now.  I can no longer be known simply as the girl in love with Kaley.  I need something new.  Tyke Turner is out on the town.  Hear him growl.  Grrr.  (I am trying to be funny but it is hard)  Goodbye.

      OK, this is the most recent update as of 3:01 PM.  She called me back a few minutes ago and she has been in Seattle for the day and was doing something with KING 5 (how ironic cuz that is what I am going to do now).  But since I have to leave now too I am going to leave the letter for her at her door somewhere and she is going to get it when she gets home.  I am both wildy nervous and excited at the same time.  However, I dare say I am fearing yet again for the worst.  I wish this was easier than it was.  But then again this is pretty much 4 years of feelings coming out all at once so it will take time for her to digest it all.  Goodbye and wish me luck!

      This is an update.  I woke up this morning and had a feeling that I have never had ever before.  It is impossible to describe.  But it is something that hurt and was one of the loneliest feelings ever.  I hardly wanted to get out of bed and wouldn't have if my mom didn't make me help her clean dishes.  Then I took a shower and I still felt horrible.  So I got on the computer and just sat.  I left my away message on but just sat there staring at Kaley.  Then I wrote her a long letter about my feelings.  It was so hard to do but still it satisfied me just a little.  Then, with my heart racing I printed it out and put it in an envelope for her to read.  Then after waiting around for a while I finally balls'd up and got the courage to push the send button on my phone.  I called her, hoping she had a minute where I could come over and simply give her the letter.  That was really all I wanted to do at that point.  Just give her the letter and then leave again unless she asked me to do something more.  But I called her and her voice message picked up so I left her a message.  Hopefully she will call back soon for I need to leave for Seattle for the night in a little over an hour.  I am so nervous.

      First off let me just get all the names out of the way.  This post will be all me and no names.  Chris Landreth is speaking now.  And for the most part he will be talking about Kaley Evanger from here on out.  I don't care if you readers get angry about what I say or if you find me the gayest person alive.  If by reading these words you don't like me then that is fine because you really shouldn't.  So to start off with, tonight was one of the best, if not the best, night of my life.  This Christmas party blew every other party ever thrown out of the water.  Taylor was an awesome hostess and I love her.  Kelsey and all of the rest of the ladies who helped out did a wonderful job and I love all of you.  Your kindness means so much to me.  It really helps me out in troubled times.  Troubled times.  I guess that troubled times would be right now for me.  My life is great and I really have only one quarrel with it.  My love life is not what I want.  At times there is no worse feeling than looking up at my monitor at the stunning beauty of my love in her spectacular senior picture.  She lights up my day more than anyone could imagine.  Tonight was absolutely amazing because of her.  Right from the start of the night we talked and were close to each other.  It only escalated as the night went on.  Gingerbread house making brought us closer than before.  We made our own house and we pictured having babies together and them growing up in it.  There is nothing I want more that that.  Looking into her eyes as she told me that gave me the warmest feeling one could ever hope for.  Her gentle, kind, and warm soul shone through to me at that very moment.  We laughed and giggled and played together while making the house and suddenly realized that everyone had left us from the table and that we were the only ones still making a house.  I had an opportunity, albeit mighty slim, to go under the mistletoe and pray that she would be caught under it with me but this did not formulate.  Instead we went back downstairs to join the rest and this is the moment I regret most about the whole night.  Then we sat next to each other and ate pizza.  Following, we watched some tape of Karaoke Night which she laughed to.  Then we went caroling.  And what a miracle of the holiday season this caroling was.  We locked arms and pranced around without a care in the world.  Our bodies were one as we looked at each other and then back at the surprised members of each household as we sang out our hearts and put on a show to be remembered.  We chatted and laughed and locked arms more as we went from house to house.  We thought of funny sayings and told them to each other and made the other laugh uncontrollably.  The singing continued and we went to her house.  Her parents answered the door and how I only wished that I could see them more often because it meant that I would be with Kaley.  And also how I wished they could be my parents-in-law one day.  I pictured how merry and bright our future holidays could be.  And then she reminded me that I still had not gotten to see her bedroom.  And I remarked how she would have to invite me over another time for me to see the roses that I had given her years ago when I first (this may sound bold but...) fell in love.  Then we went back to Taylor's and we sat next to each other and opened up our white elephant gifts.  After that exchange we layed next to each other on the floor and watched Home Alone in the dark.  As she fell asleep next to me I wanted more than anything in the world at that moment to roll over and just hold her.  To simply put my arms around her and feel her take each and every breath and to feel her heart pulsate as I gaze into her sleeping eyes.  But I knew that this could not happen.  Then as the minutes ticked away my heartbeat would rise incessantly and then calm with thoughts of her overtaking any actions occurring in the movie.  When the movie ended and most of the guests filed out, Kaley rose and went to Taylor's room to gather her belongings to leave.  I felt what I have felt so many times in my life.  The pain and sudden realization that I do not have what I want so badly to have flooded me.  It overtook me.  I just was hit by that singular fact that she is not mine.  Then I got up and trailed into the bedroom.  She got all her stuff and we hugged as she was about to leave.  Then I walked with her to the door upstairs and she put on her shoes and that was it.  She said goodbye and I said I hoped we could see each other before school started back again.  But oh how I wanted to chase after her and tell her how much I just wanted to throw all of her things on the ground and kiss her.  I do not know how I can hold back all of the feelings that rush me so blindingly but yet somehow I do.  And I know that is how it will be.  She exited my sights and I returned to Taylor's room where I sat in a chair and snuggled up with the naked 32" Walker Doll that Sicily had bought.  It would do for that time at least.  Taylor and Kelsey and Sicily tried to comfort me and assure me that I was a wonderful person.  Kelsey tried to tell me to just confess my love for her and then just get beat up by Mark but then have somebody go back and beat up Mark.  But this won't happen.  Why would Mark get jealous of me or want to beat me up unless he had a reason to.  And right now he does not have a reason to so he need not worry.  Taylor told me how Kaley loves how much I love her.  That would be great for me if only she loved me too.  So I sat and sulked in my own hopes and aspirations.  I knew that my night was over and that I would only get so many more opportunities.  Kaley means the world to me and if anything happened to her I would be fraught with despair.  My world be flip-turned upside down.  What ever may become of my situation with Kaley.  Time will only tell but being the pessimist I am, I fear for the worst.  My love for her not being returned.  Right now I really want to tell her how much I love her.  I want to take her in my arms and touch my nose to her and profess my undying adoration.  How can I ever do this?  I never see an opportunity fit to disclose such personal details such as this.  I need to call her up and get together with her.  Alone.  And just tell her how I feel from beginning to end without any interruptions from anything.  I want to hold her hand.  I want to feel the blood course through her veins.  I want to be one with her and never let go.  Kaley, you have my heart.  Can I ever have yours?

      Sunday is well passed.  It is already more than an hour into the Monday morn.  Sunday was a relaxer for the most part.  Slept til 12:30ish which was decent.  Then just got up and watched some hawks and once again Tyke's parents were both gone when he woke up.  So he had the house to himself for a while.  He talked to Amed, Tyronius, and Karla for a little while online.  Then Purdy was online too so they chatted for a while and she was talkative with him which made it fun cuz she usually isn't that talkative online.  Then he talked to Haras when she got online and they decided they are going to hang out soon.  That should be fun.  Hanging out with girls is fun.  Anyway the day progressed and Tyke helped his mom put up lights to light the pathway down the side of his house so there won't be any more incidents of Kinker taking a dive.  Later in the night the boys came over.  Amed, Macaroon, Skippy, Dr. Phil, and J-OO-les all made the trip to Party Land.  They of course played Halo.  Amed actually got some kills for once.  How bout the irony in that!  And by kills, not killing his teammate Tyronius.  At least, not that often.  Maybe not even once.  It really wasn't that exciting of a night but it was a long one.  Tyke's eyes are tired.  He is gonna be tired for the big party bash at Dottie's house tonight.  Oooooooo that is in like 18 hours or so.  He's prolly gonna be bombarded with kisses and hugs and just endless amounts of girls coming up to him at the party.  He won't even need to bring the mistletoe his mom bought today.  He supposes it was bought for him but he doesn't really know.  Like at one point she was like, "Oh so you're not going to use it to kiss Macaroon?"  That was a little weird.  Tyke is not gay.  He does not want to use mistletoe to kiss guys.  He doesn't really want to have to use mistletoe to kiss someone anyway.  Whatever, mistletoe shmistletoe...ps if you want Tyke and the mistletoe then let him know.

      Tick tock tick tock.  DAMNIT!  SNOW SNOW SNOW!!!  Tyke doesn't wanna go back to school yet.  It hasn't been long enough yet.  It started to dump some snow on Coug Mount earlier tonight but it stopped pretty quickly.  Well today was pretty fun.  Went to the mall with Skippy, Amed, Kinker, and Macaroon.  Tyke got his watch sized finally so he can wear it now.  It is still kinda big and prolly shoulda gotten another link taken off.  BUT HE IS SO SKINNY!  He is so freaking skinny.  But still hot.  Yeah, and that was fun.  He had some Panda for lunch.  Panda can taste very good.  But don't eat too much of it.  Then they all went home.  At 6 they got back together and played Halo and made 2 more videos.  The guys didn't seem to want to make Tyke's video even though it would prolly be real good.  Just cuz Tyke is the king of the video-making industry.  He is the best talent and also quite good at directing.  Only Amed could give him a run for his money on camera though.  But Tyke still reigns supreme.  For now at least.  But they made another edition of the Chris Landreth Show where they roasted Tyronius.  It was ok.  Not as good as the first though.  But every time I close my eyes I thank the lord I've got you.  And you've got me too.  Not to mention the next episode of Talking Sex.  It had its moments but was far from the quality of the first one.  Tyke did for some reason or another get topless and dance around and do a lap dance.  He has absolutely no idea why he did that actually.  Wow, that was real gay what he did.  Oh well whatever...he is still totally straight.  No gay thoughts at all.  He was freaked out by all the touching he was getting from the other guys in the hot tub so don't worry...he isn't gay.  HE LIKES GIRLS!!!  But whatever...slow songs are playing on his cd right now.  He just keeps bringing himself down with his music selection.  But the songs are so beautiful he just can't stop listening to them.  He is only missing one thing with the music.  And it is obvious what that is.  But at least the song that is playing now isn't true for him anymore.  Nobody Knows it But Me by Babyface is playing.  But in his case everybody knows it.  Including her.  She doesn't even need a name anymore.  She is infamous.  It is her and she is it.  The one, the only.  Oh yeah, Dottie is back and she talked to Tyke for a little at night.  Awesome gal.  TOMORROW IS HERE!!! "The nights are so long...the days are so sad...and I just keep thinking about the love that we had...and I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me."

      Well another day has passed.  It really was so bland and dull that Tyke probably couldn't even make it interesting.  Other than when he got attacked by giant pea-sized squirrel candy machines (don't ask) and then he made hot cocoa but somehow stumbled upon a miracle drug that amplifies the effects of Viagra.  Yeah, well enough of that stough.  It was a boring day pretty much.  It was cool that USC took care of Mich-I-can't.  Then he just watched it snow for hours and hours and hours.  Still snowing actually.  He's got about 3 inches, maybe 4, on the ground right now.  But he made a new CD and it has a bunch of good songs and is for the most part a chill cd on it.  It definitely has some "pimp songs" on it.  Then he talked about his vision for his next music video.  If all goes as he is planning for it, this video will be awesome.  Well done and just stunning.  Everything perfect except for the quality of the videotape cuz of the camera.  This next one is hopefully gonna be filmed at Amed's house Friday (to)night.  Maybe get some hot tub shots in.  That would be great.  Nothing like Tyke's hot bod to make a video even more spectacular.  Gawd, he is soooo hot.  His masculinity is only outdone by his supreme sensuality and intuition regarding the feminine mind.  If only all his knowledge could actually be applied.  TiiNa (not Tina but TiiNa).  Well Tyke is kinda smiling right now for this weird reason.  Because of the song he is listening to (This Gift by 98 Degrees) he just pictured some really great girl reading his blog and smiling to herself and thinking about how much she loved Tyke.  Yeah, well that is a little weird.  So lovfe to you all!  Dottie is a hottie!

      Wow, what a night!  Nothing that Tyke was expecting at all.  That is why he is writing this blog for Wednesday at 3:05 AM on Thursday.  It was a banging party!  A different crew came over to ring in the new year.  Amed, Tyronius, and K-Caj made it over.  They played a little PS2 before ringing in the end of 2003 with a music video to Fuck Her Gently.  Following that they did the first episode of the Tyke Turner Show/Macaroon McGee Roast.  Then K-Caj left and the three remaining made more videos.  They did a music video to What is Love for Amed and then they did one last show.  Talking Sex with Amed Annoying.  What a show this was.  With live call-ins and the Sex Toys of the Day, this episode will surely be long remembered.  These videos are priceless.  Ya'll gots ta watch them cuz they should make you laugh your 'nutcranker' off.  Going into the night Tyke was not looking forward to it but it turned into a blast of a night.  However it is after 3 AM and Tyke already is a little short of sleep so he is gonna try and get some now.  Love to the people I love.  Like to the people I like.  Indifference towards those I don't know.

      Well yesterday was an experience.  It started out as just a great day.  Went out to Pie with Skippy and Karla.  Then we met Dudely at Matthew's and we went back to his house for a little.  Then we went to Best Buy and got some stuff there.  Then we went to Burger King but we had to turn around and we ended up in this dealership back lot place and Skippy tried to get some air off this little lip and smacked his car on the ground!  IT WAS SICK!  Hella sweet.  Later on they all met up at Skippy's and played a little Halo and Fever before going bowling.  Tyke, Skippy, Karla, Dudely, and Amed all came.  Amed had to leave in the 4th frame cuz his pops made him cuz of the snow.  The rest all stayed though.  Tyke drove and they decided to hit up JIB on the way home cuz it was right next to the bowling alley.  So right when Tyke hit snow he lost complete control of the car.  He was like, "This is gonna be a long drive home."  And it was.  They got on the main road and the freeway and he had control there.  Then he got up closer to Lakemont (one of the back routes...not Lakemont Boulevard) and two of the hills his 92 Volvo beast had some problems with.  Skippy and Dudely helped push the car up while Tyke was doing his best to command his car up the hill.  They got it up both but not before burning a lot of rubber and Skippy and Dudely getting quite wet.  Then when Tyke got closer to Skippy's he lost complete control of the car and that was sick.  He almost jumped the sidewalk but he got control of the brakes just in time to stop it.  It was quite an experience.  All the kids knew they couldn't get home so they just spent the night at Skippy's.  It was cool.  A fun time.  Then Tyke left at like 12 and came home and stuff.  It felt great to shower.  Now he is bored a little and is not really looking forward to tonight because it will probably suck since nobody is free.  And if they are free then it will be like a 3 person party.  Yippee! :/

      Monday was supposed to be a good day.  It really wasn't.  Tyke is getting a little sad now about his total busts over break.  Tonight could almost be classified as a total bust.  The only thing that kept it from being one is that he got to spend a couple hours with Purdy and Tina!  They both came over along with Purdy's cousin.  It wasn't horrible but when they ran out of things to do it just seemed like a bummer.  They liked the Amazed music video even though it was a little creepy.  But it was not awkward between Tyke and Tina.  They both acted normal except when Purdy videotaped Tina and then said "this is the love of Tyke's life", Tina was like "Nooo, don't say that" or something like that.  Tyke can't actually remember what went on exactly.  But it is definitely on tape.  So now he will go watch the tape to find out.  Ok, that is over.  He seriously just left his blog to go watch the whole video.  Well, it just emphasized how it kinda sucked.  There was a lot of Tina in it and that is why it was decent though.  Oh fuck...here it comes again.  Shiiiit.  That fucking feeling has just come flying back to Tyke.  Not the strong desire for Tina, although that is still there, but the loneliness.  Shiiiiiiiit.  It was gone for a little while.  But damnit, now it is back.  And it sucks big time.  Well, here is an attempt at an explanation.  There is this sharp little feeling a little above his heart and then a little above his stomach.  It kinda sends a pulse through his abdomen and that starts to make this feeling that flows through his body.  Then his mind starts acting up too.  It gets distraught and sorta depressed.  He thinks about what he wants to be doing and have and wishes for it.  Yet he knows nothing will come of it and that is where the pain resides.  In the nothingness.  The deep and bottomless pit that can only be filled with the companionship of others.  It can be filled but it just hasn't been.  Simply hanging out with people really does help.  But over break that really has not happened since the party A WEEK AGO!  Tonight could have been a chance to build on that but it floundered in its own despair.  It was kinda damned from the start.  Only one event planned for the night (DDR) and only 2 definite guests for the night.  Tina was a possibility and she ended up coming through in the end.  Well, this just spelled disaster.  Now don't get Tyke wrong...hanging out with them was awesome just cuz he got to be in their company.  But then they left after being there for less than 2 hours to go bowl.  Of course Purdy offered for the guys to come but how much fun would that be for them?  It really wouldn't have been that entertaining.  This is just gay though.  Like, there is so much right out there for Tyke but none of it is reachable.  Kinda like throwing out some candy to a baby but then yoinking it right back from its face.  So then the baby starts to cry...well Tyke hasn't actually cried about this but it still is sorta pissing him off.  It isn't anyone's fault but his own really.  And maybe it ain't his fault either.  But this hell-hole has to be ditched and left for a promising new region filled with lavender skies and peach-colored dew.  Tyke is far from being in dire straits here but he really wants some help.  The main problem is just that nobody can give Tyke the exact medicine he needs.  He just needs a person(s) to just be there for him and spend time with him.  If any person could do that then he would be so grateful.  Yet again, the people that seem to truly be able to do that are guys.  And it just isn't the same after a while.  He needs that feminine contact.  He longs for it.  He searches for it.  He comes back to no avail.  At one point in the night he almost wished for school to start up again.  Then he realized he must be insane and went back to thinking about other less depressing things.  He can only hold himself back for so long before things go insane.  Fuck some of this shit...

      Sunday is once again in the past.  It panned out to be an alright day but still not fun-filled.  Boring start and nobody was free to do anything and Macaroon wasn't being a good sport about Tyke's great ideas for what to do.  So Tyke just stayed home.  Then at like 4:30 Skippy was free so Tyke tried to call Macaroon but his line was busy for at least a half hour.  So finally he got a hold of him and he was about to sit down to dinner in like an hour.  They still met over there and played a few games of Halo.  Then Tyke and Skippy went to Mongolian Grill for dinner.  It was a very quality meal.  Then Tyke called back Macaroon but Amed and other guys were all unavailable.  So it ended up being Tyke, Skippy, and Macaroon for the night.  Tyke called up Purdy and she called back later and they have set preliminary plans to have a fun night of DDR and such at Tyke's house Monday night.  Not to mention the showing of the TWO music videos and other shots of footage from oddball things.  Yes, thats right folks.  TWO VIDEOS!!!  Well the three studs made another music video.  This one was to Amazed by Lonestar.  This one was done with more thinking and planning though so it turned out well.  To just put it simply, it involves Tyke and Tina.  That is all that can be said for now.  You would have to see it to believe it.  But the makers consider it quality work.  Just watch it to find out.  So after that they didn't have much to do really.  They played some Halo and stuff but it really wasn't awesome.  Then Macaroon left and it was just Tyke and Skippy.  They just filmed themselves talking and it was pretty gay but whatever.  At least it, actually no it was gay.  Whatever...time to try and SLEPP!  Tyke loves slepping.  He could slep all the time if it were possible.  Slep, slep, slep, all day long.

      Today actually turned out to be a quality day for Tyke.  It started out normal with him waking up tired and all cuz he isn't sleeping much.  Then he actually ate some doughnuts for breakfast which he hardly ever has.  Then he just talked to some people and then played some games.  Then he watched some of the Seahawks and Purdy messaged him while he was away.  It was cool cuz it was unexpected and unexpected things are always unexpectedly awesome.  Then later that day Mandy messaged him too!  What a day!  But Tyke and Skippy went down to B^2 just to get out of the house.  It was pretty fun and they saw this 'oh so fine honey' there that is 'oh so fine.'  She deserves to be given a look.  Anyway, he came back home and had dinner.  Later Amed, Macaroon, and Dr. Phil came over and the 4 of them played NOT HALO.  They played Medal of Honor:Rising Sun with the 4-player mode and it was wicked fun.  Another totally unexpected turn of events.  Instead of being able to play Halo they had to play this but this was also a blast of a time.  Team mode was sick.  Nothing like a good Wellington...I mean Wellesley...I mean Weldon...I mean Welrod.  Yeah thats it, welrod.  Well anyway tomorrow Tyke is gonna call up some of his lady friends to see if they wanna hang out soon.  So all you chicas be on the alert.  Cuz this Ty-ger is on the prowl (yeah, already used that but it works here too).

      Friday was a long day and a short night.  School was a little more work than the other 2 days of school this week and it seemed pretty long too.  But Tyke came through it doing just fiiiine.  3rd period was fun despite the Libertarian party guy coming in and speaking and doing just a horrible job.  Amed would have done much much better just going up there and talking for like 5 minutes about what the class really needed to know.  Tyke, Purdy, and Haras talked about his blog from last night and how awesome it was.  And also about what they like in his blog.  Hence the reason that he is even mentioning the fact that they talked about since it really isn't that newsworthy to most of you.  But of course everyone loves to get mentioned in Tyke's blog, including Tyke himself.  He always loves going back and reading about all the times he mentions Tyke's name.  (*whispers "don't tell anyone but Tyke actually only skims the prose to find his own name in the text...hehehehehehe...sooo badd ass")  But really it is just fun to have mentionings in this blog.  Wink wink (don't worry no tickling this time...tickle day is Thursday even though Tyke actually does remember getting tickled by Dottie in 4th period).  Speaking of Dottie she said that it is hard for her to read this sometimes cuz of all the names.  Tyke has taken this into consideration and at some soon point he is going to venture into making a list of all the names and their true counterparts.  It will take a while to do which is why Tyke is sorta postponing this weighty task until the preponderance of the moment is past (btw that was a total misusage of preponderance but Tyke needed to fit that in somewhere so here it got "sticked" in).  The school day progressed and ended up ending after 6th period.  In 6th period though Tyke made up some great songs such as the Student Force Sensor song.  Additionally, he got into a raucous ruckus with Purdy over the correct singing of the Captain Planet theme song.  It was the part where he takes pollution down to zero.  Tyke grew up singing it one way and he has seemingly been proven wrong and he totally accepts defeat but oh if he finds out he was right.  There are gonna be some arses getting rammed.  Eh, not so much actually.  Cuz really it was mostly guys that were saying Tyke was wrong and he really isn't into arse-ramming anyway.  But for now he accepts total defeat and he demotes himself from being the Fire guy to the gay Heart guy who always is playing with his monkey.  The animal, that is (ooo Tyke is so dirrty tonight).  Singing is awesome.  He just remembered he was singing a lot in 4th period with Purdy and Dottie.  That was awesome.  You are my sunshine.  My only sunshine.  When you're not happy, my skies are gray.  You'll never know dear how much I love you.  Please don't take my sunshine away.  Any problems with the lyrics that Tyke has there???  Go ahead and correct them should anyone have a propensity to say so.  It seems like people like to disprove Tyke.  And when he says disprove he means SHOVE IT IN HIS FACE AND MAKE IT COME OUT HIS RIGHT BIG TOE!  But then again he does act like he is real smart and a total egghead (his mom used to work at Egghead also).  This is a lengthy blog.  But a fun one to write.  Ok, he needs to get to the after school part.  Well he came home with Amed, Fejj (jewish fejj), and Tyronius.  They played some PS2 and then all but Tyron went to play bball up by Tyke's house.  It was fun especially since Tyke won both games of 21 and P-I-G.  Then they split and Tyke had BK for dinner.  It was g-o-o-D.  Everyone was at the bball game of course.  And Haras was cheering of course.  Another awesome performance turned in by the Indian Princess.  But the great crew was there.  Especially the Maniak as he and Tyke were taunting and jeering and cheering and doing whatever it took to get those "Eagles" a 3OT victory.  After the game the congratulations were given around the stands as Tyke was given MVP by Principal Mikey G.  Eh, that was stupid.  Not funny.  Can't be funny when you try to be.  That is like an oxymoron-trying to be funny.  Just ain't gonnas works.  OK, no more sidetracking.  Kinker, Maniak, DUI, Macaroon, Dudely, Karla, Fejj, Amed, Kcaj, and Tyke all went to IVE to play bball under the lights.  It was wicked fun.  Tyke used his special move on Macaroon several times in order to get by him.  The old Nip-Slip and slip by move.  Works like a charm.  A lucky charm.  Stuck to a rabbit's foot.  Dipped in caramel.  Ah crap.  Tyke is thinking now that nobody took his ball with them as they left the court.  Which would mean right now a decent basketball is just sitting at a freaking elementary school court unsupervised in the cold with no pants on.  If it doesn't get frostbite it is definitely gonna get YOINKED.  Shiiiiit...yoink city man.  Well that is hardcore sucky.  Cuz it was his only decent ball now since all his other balls have holes in them so they don't function properly meaning he can't have a good time.  Tyke just realized that he has been writing this blog for at least half an hour.  That definitely means it is time to stop.  Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, Heart, with our powers combined...damn my ball got stolen...CAPTAIN PLANET SAVE ME!!!

      FUN!!!!  That is what Thursday was.  It was a very nice day.  An excellent reprieve from the norm.  The norm of course being the snow days that Tyke was stuck at home.  He got up and found out he had the 2 hour delay and that was great.  But the odd thing is that he had woken up at 6:08 on his own and he woke up from this dream.  In his dream he basically went through Thursday as if there was no school.  So he was all in no-school mode.  Then he woke up.  And since he had just been dreaming he thought it was no school that day.  So being the stud that he is, he turned his alarm off and went back to sleep.  Ouch, bad idea.  Luckily 1-2 minutes later when he was almost asleep again he suddenly realized that he didn't actually know if school was cancelled.  Needless to say he got a little freaked.  But he pulled it together and found out what he needed to know.  And then he went back to sleep for a couple of hours which was nice.  The day was awesome cuz he really barely did anything.  1st period was cool cuz he just hung out with Tina and Karla (sorry Karla but Tina always goes first).  So that was cool (more about Tina in a second).  Second period through the rest of the day was good too.  Another great lunch too made it great.  He ended up going to Pie for lunch.  Not his decision but he was certainly fine with the group's decision.  The pizza there is second to none (total lie right there by the way).  But anyway he got through the day and the great pal that Skippy is, he gave Tyke a ride home.  It really was a great car ride.  They haven't had a car ride in a while and this could start sounding homosexual soon and they both are not so Tyke is just gonna skip over this part.  Oh wait, that ending also makes it sound gay.  Damn, well that whole last part could just get deleted but Tyke likes to let everyone know his thoughts unedited.  And this is the truth.  Most of what you read has never been reread or anything.  Grammatical and spelling errors are fixed but other than that it is all just thought up and jotted down.  No joke.  You are reading the uncensored thoughts of a total beefcake.  He doesn't wear Beefy T's though.  Annnnnnyway he got home and just hung out for a while.  He actually did his homework early and then he took out the trash.  Then he left to meet Skippy at JIB just like the old days.  Then they went to the gymnastics meet.  Upon arrival they saw Ekul and Haras' Kram so they went over and talked with them for a good 5+ minutes.  It was cool.  They are good guys of course.  They have to be since they are dating such awesome girls (wink wink nudge nudge tickle tickle).  "tickle tickle???"  WTF does that mean???  Eh, it just came out.  But seriously folks, tonight was cool.  Skippy and Tyke moved back to the Issy cheering section and Haras came so they talked a little and then Purdy came and they talked some too.  Later on Tyke went over to where Purdy, Ekul, Haras, good Kram, and Tina were sitting and sat with them.  That was fun.  Him and Ekul talked and then he went over and sat by Tina cuz all the couples were "coupling."  Don't worry, he didn't hit on her or try to make a move or anything idiotic like that.  But it was sort of different between them for a little while.  It was sorta like Tyke is kinda afraid of her.  He is afraid now of being too "in your face" with her.  He just feels like he can't be around her that often or she is going to get kinda taken aback and kinda not like his advances even though they are not advances.  The odd thing is that he really thinks that he is over her.  Over his insatiable desire to be with her that is.  He still loves her madly but is totally able to control it.  He is not in love with bad Kram though.  He really doesn't like him.  He is too...eh, don't know what the word is...grrrrrr will have to suffice.  He is just too grrrrrr.  He is not a good guy for her in Tyke's eyes.  And other people's eyes too apparently.  She deserves someone who will treat her like a little angel cuz that is totally what she is.  So angelic and sweet.  And she can be quite innocent too.  But enough of this lovefest.  Tyke wants to get this thing wrapped up so it can get published for the world to view.  Thats right!  The world!!!

      Hi ya'll.  Wednesday was a good day.  No school always makes a bad day a good one.  Again Tyke was stuck at home.  He really shouldn't have been cuz the roads really were not bad.  But of course his mom was being anal and made him stay home yet again.  That was kinda gay.  But he made the best of it.  Well, he at least made some good out of it.  He didn't really do anything again but it wasn't too bad today.  Maybe he is just getting used to being alone again.  That is what it was like when he lived in Preston.  He never had people over or went and did anything then.  But he never had so he wasn't bored or lonely or anything.  It was when he moved to Sammamish and started hanging out with friends everyday that he found out what he would miss out on.  And then with people beginning to date and all there was less time for Tyke.  Which is actually in some ways a good thing.  Tyke is sorta becoming more independent like he used to be.  It helps that he has primarily his own floor downstairs.  He gets to hang out and talk and stuff like that without worrying about parents being around.  And that is really nice sometimes.  But really he has run out of things that are semi-interesting.  He won't have his car tomorrow but Skippy said he can give him a ride home so that is awesome.  And who knows, there is that minute chance of no school.  Yeah, thats right...a tiny chance of yet another day staying home.  4 schools in the Issy District were without power at 5:30 according to the Issaquah School District website.  That means there is an ever so slight chance of no school on Thursday.  But Tyke certainly is not counting on that.  He has gotten all his homework done and everything so he is set to go.  The snow isn't fully gone yet either.  But it is far from being as beautiful as it is when it covers the whole area.  That is quite a sight.  Ok, this is just about to turn into rambling.  Here is something for all of you to think about: how old is the oldest 8 year old?

      Bleh.  Eh, today just kinda slipped by.  Too lazy to really do anything and it wasn't much fun out in the snow just cuz Tyke was out there by himself.  But can't take these kind of days for granted.  As boring as they might be or as much as Tyke wishes he was doing other stuff he still has to be happy with the fact that he doesn't have to go to school.  Tomorrow might not be a school day so who knows.  If there is school though it is a Wednesday so it ain't too bad.  But if there is school it means he gets to hang out with Haras and Dottie and Purdy.  Not to mention Skippy and the hilarious Amed and Dr. Phil Lelee.  But whatever.  Tyke is looking forward to the next time he gets to go out to lunch.  He could go for a lot of things.  Pie, JIB, Subway, BK, mmmm...it just never ends.  Actually he wants to go to Wendy's but he won't be able to do that very well during lunch.  So he will have to hit that up at some other time.  But it will be good to get out of the house again.  He still actually hasn't finished sending in all of his college applications too.  Which isn't good but he still has time and there is no rush.  This blog was not as good as the previous nights.  But there was more to talk about yesterday.  It sounds like Tyke's friends had fun sledding and such.  Tyke hasn't gone sledding in so long.  At his old house it was fun but there isn't any spot near his new house.  So instead he just ate and watched tv and chatted online which is fun in itself but it is tough to have a day of just talking to a computer.  Hehe, good times though.  But the best part about these snow days is that Tyke and the rest of the seniors don't have to make up these days cuz they will be GRADUATED!!!  That is gonna be great.  College coming up soon...New people...new great times...This seems like a total repeat of past blogs.  Damn, TYKE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING!!!  This weekend better be a blast!  COME ON SCHOOL, GET CANCELLED!!!

      This might sound weird but going to school was actually nice today.  Mainly cuz Tyke didn't really do much of anything.  But he got to actually see people again.  That was a blessing for him.  He was really so bored before that he was looking forward to seeing people again.  Mainly the opposite sex of course.  But then that was quickly over and he went home and did nothing.  Well, he went to take his mom's van into the shop for some collision repair.  Then when he was driving her home on the bare freeway he was of course speeding and was going 68.  So his mom says, "you're speeding" and his response was of course, "yeah i know."  He was like, ok that's cool but why should i care...it's not like I am in trouble for doing it.  He was still getting passed by most cars anyway.  He had actually considerably toned down his normal driving just for his mom's peace of mind.  But of course that won't happen.  Then she lectured him on how he should always have gloves and a hat on cold days cuz you never know what might happen.  His response to that was, "So do you carry gloves and a hat everywhere you go during all seasons?  Cuz you never know when you might get stuck in a really cold place."  Of course not!  It seems absurd that Tyke could always be prepared for every possible scenario that could happen.  That wouldn't be fun.  It's cool when your friends have to get out of your car and push you up a snowy hill.  It's fun when you have to sleep over at a friend's house cuz you didn't prepare for snowy conditions.  It's fun when you realize that you forgot to put on your pants when you go out to meet up with some friends.  Well, the last one has never actually happened to anyone Tyke has ever known and it prolly wouldn't be fun.  Nor would there be much of a chance of someone "forgetting" to put their pants on but hey, he needed a third sentence for that last idea.  Yeah, well it better snow a good amount and get school cancelled.  Tyke has a feeling he won't be writing very long blogs for a little while.  Just cuz his life is so bland and vanilla.  Mmmm...vanilla ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream and belgian waffles and frozen yogurt and Peeps and Altoids and hot, sticky caramel and the Olsen twins...ooo how'd that last part get in there!!!

      Today blew but oh well...at least at worst we have to go to school for only 4 and a half hours tomorrow.  Yeah, Tyke did absolutely nothing again today.  Today he got iced in so he didn't even go to KING 5 again to work.  He has 12 hours done so far but still needs 18 more.  Oh well it is pretty fun work and he has 3+ months with which to complete it in.  So he just sat on his skinny ass all day again.  That is 2+ days now of not seeing anybody.  He is getting cabin fever.  And this is nothing.  He is probably too much of a social person.  Whenever he could be hanging out with people and isn't he gets a little annoyed, and oh so bored.  So he talked to a few people online.  Mainly Kinker cuz everyone else seemed to be out enjoying themself with other friends in the snow and ice.  Like all of Tyke's Coug Mount friends had people around.  Kinker and Tyke got bored but at least they got to talk to each other about the usual, sports mainly.  Well since today had nothing good to write about and Tyke is not looking forward to anything, he might as well cut his losses here and just stop writing.  Let's see how many people IM him and tell him they were disappointed with the blog.  His guess is 6.

      Another freaking day has passed.  Shiiiiiiiit.  Well today was another day of Tyke playing with himself (yeah, he meant for it to sound dirty even though in reality there is no reason for it to sound dirty cuz it wasn't dirty).  He did nothing with nobody.  It was pleasing to just sit and watch the silent snow settle on the bountiful landscape.  It just assuages the wishful moods that are muddled in Tyke's tormenting mood.  Whatever.  Actually it makes him more pensive so it has an adverse effect on him.  But for some odd reason he likes to torture himself on these topics.  Yeesh, this isn't a great start for tonight's blog.  He is hoping to actually be able to post this blog before the clock strikes midnight.  By the way, Amed is gay because he won't let Tyke see when he is typing which would make their conversations easier.  So Tyke just had to let everyone know that Amed is stubborn.  Anyway it was cold today as everyone knows.  Still very cold.  In the low to mid 20s right now.  It is fun to play in the snow but Tyke hasn't done that for years really.  He used to make jumps at his old house in the huge backyard they had and he and his brother would have a blast spending hours just getting air and then crashing into the woods and hurting themselves.  The days used to be so much simpler back then.  Tyke seems to recall already saying this in a previous blog but they really were.  He could have fun easier.  Now he is too obsessed with the opposite sex and his desires (not sexual) regarding them.  But as is life.  And at times life is a bitch.  But for the most part life is something that you cannot get caught up taking too seriously.  Just live life as it comes and have fun.  Don't always take shortcuts either.  Sometimes you need to get dirty and pave yourself a new route.  But other times just stick on the road you are on.  Let yourself be the best judge.  Heed others advice but don't get bogged down in it.  Tyke sometimes heeds the advice of other too much.  He doesn't let himself pick his own path, fearful of mistakes.  That is why he was so proud of himself for telling her how he felt.  It was an accomplishment that he can't overlook.  But also, he feels it most important that you don't overlook your friends who have helped make you the person you are now.  That is so very important.  Because friends will not always stay friends.  People change.  People will get angry and not feel the same about you forever.  Keep your friends close.  Don't let a new person in your life become too much of your life.  Because this person hasn't been there for you your whole life.  Now Tyke feels that he must not be a hypocrite and if he is given the chance to be one he must not crumble and fall like so many before him.  Stay strong and stand tall.  Oh yeah, and Britney got married.  First Jessica Simpson, now Britney!  Who's next?!?!?!  Could it be HER?!?!?!?!  Nah, not unless Tyke is the one.  But oh yeah, another thing.  Tyke has realized that hope is not all its cracked up to be.  Sure hope can occasionally be great.  But in most cases in Tyke's life it just causes immense pain and torment.  It is the cause of great evils.  Hope keeps dreams just what they are...dreams.  In order for dreams to become a reality, action needs to be taken.  So remember, action over hope.  Bye.  Damn, didn't get it done before midnight.

      Friday is really one of those days that is just great.  Just simply great.  It has a real aura around it that just gives off those positive vibes.  Real positive vibes.  Nothing like the sensation of knowing that you are going to have fun once the bell rings.  Fun is easy to have as long as you are named Tyke.  School was pretty stupid.  One comical event was when Tyke and Purdy were talking and she told him that she had felt the feeling that Tyke mentioned in a blog many blogs ago.  It was just like a painful feel and Tyke apparently described it really well cuz she understood it and felt it even.  So that meant that he is good at using words to convey ideas and that is quite a useful task in life.  Especially in his proposed career in which he needs to know the best word to use in a situation that creates the most vivid picture for his audience.  Hit them with one word and you will hit them with a million.  Whatever that may mean to you is probably true.  Not all things, Tyke can think of a couple that wouldn't be true, but for the most part make up your own meaning to that.  Well anyway the rest of the day eased by but was far from being easy.  After school the crew (actually too lazy to list everyone so sorry) gathered up their belongings and went off to the land of carpet dreams.  No, not Carpet Sense with Flynn but the Community Center to play some good old fashioned shirtless hoops.  As usual Tyke's team was shirtless (he seems to be that way a lot) and they were not that good.  Mainly cuz Kinker was on the other team and he was the best and had the most energy.  So he kinda dominated.  Tyke didn't have his outside jumper working too well and his legs were reaaaaaal tired from doing squats today but he trudged on to complete a solid day.  Far from his status quo performance but he will build on that and when some of the returners return next week Tyke should be able to take them on.  Oh yeah, Tyke wore 6 sweatbands and a headband.  One under his right and left knees, one on the right and left upper arm, and one on the right and left forearm.  Then of course the headband on his head.  It was definitely cute.  Too cute.  "Love me I'm a baby and I smile cute" cute.  "Oops, I spilled ketchup all over my shirt so I better take it off" cute.  Even "look at me I'm cute" cute.  2Kute cute.  Anyway he did that and it was done.  So then he went home.  Macaroon, Skippy, Kinker, Amed, and Tyronius came over later before the girls bball game.  They all played Halo and some games before leaving.  Then they got their pizza at the game and sat down.  Tyke and Haras talked during the game about the showdown against Sly Lion.  It will be a battle, which unfortunately will most likely be lost by the boys but oh well.  But the two got to talking about how Tyke needed to get real spirited for that game.  He already is pretty much Haras and the crew's number one fan though.  But like Tyke thinks that he and his crew or anyone else who wants to should make their own little group to rival the Olympians of Sly Lion.  Something like the Togas of years past, just good.  But that would mean some work and probably even some preparation.  Tyke and Haras decided they might have like a pre-party at Tyke or Haras' house to get everybody painted and oiled (Tyke just added that one now cuz it sounds nice) for the game.  Sure the "cool" seniors would think that all the guys are gay but FUCK them.  They don't mean shit.  Sorry for the outburst.  But Tyke likes himself more than those guys.  "Hehe, I'm funny."  Who was Tyke just then???  That's right...one of the senior guys who is actually pretty stupid.  So anyway though, the crew mostly came back to the land of Tyke and played some more games.  The hours from 10-12 passed way too quickly and were way too fun.  But the time is gone anyway so no need to get all misty-eyed.  Well, this blog has been far from a joy to read but what do you expect from a Friday blog?  Unless something really awesome happens to Tyke it is just gonna be a factual presentation of his factual day.  But today wasn't a day that involved ladies so nothing to report.  In fact, Tyke needs to have a night out with the ladies.  Not necessarily out but really the last time they all hung out was at the Christmas party which was like a month ago almost.  But that's aight cuz everyone has busy lives.  Not so much Tyke, which is really one of the reasons he can write such dedicated blogs.  And that can be thought of as both sad and the opposite of sad or "not sad."  But for all of you who are bored now you can go do something else cuz Tyke is going to also, if you know what he means.  Do you?  That would be really great if you did.  But answer him this...Where in the world is Carmen San Diego???  And speaking of San Diego...Dotti is like so totally cool.  Tyke really wishes they were talking right now.  Oh wait, THEY ARE!!!! IMAGINE THAT!!!!!  (pause 15 seconds for imagination)  annnnnnddd...SCENE!

      Today was quite a productive day.  Well maybe not productive but entertaining at least.  1st period rolled through and get this Tyke is not even going to talk about Tina other than this little tidbit of a sentence here.  The assembly they had for diversity week/MLK was decent.  Tyke sat with Haras, Purdy, and Skippy (from right to left and from closest to furthest from Tyke).  The rest of the day progressed smoothly.  Oh yeah, well Tyke lied just a little ago in his blog.  He said he wasn't gonna talk about Tina but now he is.  Tyke has seen Tina and Kram together again and he just doesn't understand it.  He thinks that they are having problems and they decide to split.  But then wait, are they not split?  It is just puzzling to Tyke as he seems to believe that Tina isn't happy or at least she is having problems in the relationship and yet it just continues.  Tyke really doesn't think he should be saying any of this though as it is not his place to say anything and especially on his blog but really he would talk about this with his friends most likely and his friends all read this so this way he can just get it out there instead of having to do it too cumbersomely.  But Tyke apologizes for any toes he steps on or if he is being inconsiderate or even just too nosy (pretty much just speaking to Tina here if she actually reads this but he still does not believe he does-if she does then she should get online and IM him, homestar wunna3, yeah thats right he just put is SN on the internet but that is the beauty of blocking people cuz he can just block everyone who annoys him).  Well anyway the rest of the day was good.  After school Macaroon called Tyke on Dr. Phil's cell and asked if he wanted to come up and hang out.  Tyke jumped on the offer to do so and Fejj came over and then Amed came over.  Later on Skippy even came over.  They played Halo again and it was a grand ol' time.  Tyke came home and didn't really do anything and still hasn't done anything actually.  He hasn't done homework at night for at least a month now.  Counting break that is.  But still he has not studied, learned or done anything at home for more than a month.  He is just flat out giving up on school it seems like.  He is still completing the homework and doing well enough on tests but he is far from focused.  Friends, blogging, and AIM have taken over his life.  And yet he is fine with that.  Haras and Tyke talked for some of the night.  Just about some really deep things.  Ya know, like the existence of a parallel universe and the infinitesimal nature of a grain of sand (for your sake Tyke hopes you didn't actually believe that).  But then they both went to watch Friends.  However, there has been some groundbreaking news tonight that could really end up affecting millions of people around the world.  No, seriously.  If everything happens how Tyke and Amed are hoping it will happen then they both will be very well-off and the world over will be better just by knowing them.  Confused as to what this subject is?  Well Tyke and Amed decided that they are going to partake in an endeavor that could bring to them great riches and hot bitches (that was used as nothing more than a great rhyme...no literal meaning) or it will just be a long time spent on doing something that could still be self-satisfying.  Yes, this endeavor is a novel.  Not a novellete or anything like that.  A full on novel.  They talked for a little while just brainstorming ideas and though they don't want to give too much away, here is the proposed storyline.  Two people live separate lives, a Socialist Russian growing up in hard times loathing the land of the free and the home of the brave and a young middle-class American girl who seems to be quite content with her life but is deep down a hopeless romantic longing for more.  Will these two ever cross paths (of course they will or it would be an idiotic book).  But how will they meet and under what circumstances will these two flourish?  Stay tuned to hear more.  Actually you probably won't hear much more.  But they plan to write like a real novel, 200 pages or so, an intricate plot, fully developed characters that are highly relatable.  This should be a striking escapade in the talented lives of the two young men from the foothills of the majestic state of Washington.  Tyke and his crew, however, have also planned an adventure for Friday.  And this is going to be a blast!  Friday basketball is getting started once again.  It should be a real fun time.  The crew is getting reassembled with a few key returners and the usual star Tyke Turner leading the way but some impact newcomers are gonna try to make a showing in their first attempt at carpet basketball.  Tyke will be getting out his headband and sweatbands, his beater, and definitely his really good shooting skills.  He loves basketball.  Tyke+sports=oh man this is really fun to do because Tyke is good at most of them even though he isn't real strong or big but he is still pretty talented and agile and quick and smart and knows the game well.  Tyke is really looking forward to the 3-day weekend even though it means that he should be doing a lot of homework and studying.  He probably won't though because he really isn't big on doing stuff like that.  Now if he was working on getting into the home of a girl (get it homework-working home???) or studying the bodacious bodies of females then maybe he would be more inclined to put his skills to the test.  But he's not.  Well, at least he hasn't been offered.  Offers are still acceptable.  And offers for the president of his fan club are still out there.  Actually nobody seems to be jumping over that job.  It really isn't a job.  More of just something to put on a resume.  Speaking of resumes Tyke just realized that the Friends series is almost over.  Which means no more Friends parties.  Speaking of Friends parties there hasn't been one in at least 6 years (1 year=approximately 1 week).  That should be annihiliated with the Friends party of a lifetime.  Like for the series finale if there isn't one, Tyke might have to have one at his house.  Cuz there should be.  His parents may not even care.  Cuz that will be during second semester and who the hell gives a care about second semester?  Has anyone noticed how Tyke tones down the swearing on this blog?  He thinks it is just to try and keep it safe for all those people who may read it and don't like it when people swear, which Tyke respects.  Sure he swears like a Swearing Sailor at times but that is just cuz it is fun to do.  He means no harm.  Sometimes at least.  And really, isn't it better to not offend most than not please some?  It is all about the majority in Tyke's blog.  Sorry, but it be the truth.  Or if you are a really nice person you might get preferential treatment.  And yeah, if you are a female you are already at like +38.  So you pretty much are set.  Goodnight and join Tyke and Brandy (singing "Have You Ever" in the background right now) next time.  You all have a safe drive home, ya hear?

      Yep, back to basics.  Tyke and Kinker went off to the city of angels.  Or at least Bellevue.  First they did the physics at Kinker's house.  Then they left.  It was fun.  Just the two of them but still Tyke had fun.  He was quite surprised at the coincidence of seeing Michael King at the game though.  He came from doing a story on a wrestler over at Newport or Sammamish and then came to do some film of the game.  So Tyke and Kinker went over and talked about stuff.  To specify one of the stuff topics, Michael asked if Tyke or Kinker had any girlfriends on the team.  Well of course they responded no.  So he then asked if they had any prospects or something like that.  Well, knowing Tyke you know where this is gonna go.  Tyke responds, "Yeah, I pursued one girl but she would have nothing of it."  So Michael then asked which girl it was later and Tyke pointed out Tina.  So then when Tina got the ball, Michael was like, "Hey #10's got the ball."  Ahhh, good times.  Yet another person knows about Tyke and Tina.  Maybe Tyke is being too willing to tell everyone his feelings and all.  Maybe that makes Tina feel uncomfortable.  Well that is definitely not his intention.  He is just comfortable in having everybody know what he feels.  That way he has something of a support group.  Well anyway the girls won and that was cool.  There was a total of 3 IHS students at the game not affiliated with the game or Tyke or Kinker.  But on the way home Tyke and Kinker managed to strike up the subject of Kram for a little.  They talked about how Kram has talked about Tyke a little bit before.  Apparently talking with Frederique while doing so and basically how Tyke was a turd.  That isn't such a bad thing though.  If someone was in love with your girlfriend (or ex...) then there would probably be some somewhat harsh feelings.  And apparently Kram thought Tyke was being too forward and should back off.  Now that is stupid.  Tyke definitely did not need to back off.  Does walking together before and after class and Tyke coming to her sports events qualify as being too forward?  It certainly shouldn't.  Sure he was head over heels for her but that didn't mean he was buying her flowers and candy and singing her songs outside her window in the pouring rain at night (which sounds fun...something Tyke could do in the future perhaps).  He was just being friendly.  It is not like he was planning a time to jump Kram in the halls and stab him (never came to his mind either...seriously folks, come on).  Another thing.  The fact that they are not together does not make Tyke's situation any better just to let you know.  It's not like Tyke is going to go after her again now.  And regarding him and her perhaps going to prom together.  He is a little sketchy on that too.  Like if he did ask her he couldn't make it a surprise.  There are only so many times he can face rejection from one girl without losing total faith.  He has already been rejected twice by her.  Yeah, twice.  Once in 9th grade he believes.  That wasn't quite as bad though as this year's as it wasn't straight up coming out and hitting her with it.  But it still hurt a little then.  Man, this girl has taken 4 years of my life.  And she hardly even knows it really.  The time he has spent thinking about her is remarkable.  Oh well...this was just an appendage to the last blog so he should probably wrap it up.  And right now his mood is not depressed or sad or anything.  He is fine now.  Not great but just doing good.  And good is good.  So that is all.  Time to do other things such as sleep.

      Yes, this may seem a little early for a blogging but Tyke has recently gotten very obsessed with his blog.  He always wants to be writing in it.  And today after school he just really craved it.  So now it is time.  Well he will at least write about some things he did today.  And if he has more to talk about tonight then he can just add a new post.  Today began normal.  Tyke and Tyronius sat in his car before school, which isn't normal and then Tyke decided to walk alone to math.  That also wasn't normal but it might become normal.  Tyke then got in math and just sat there.  He didn't talk to Tina and sorta just played like he had nothing to say to her.  Which of course is false.  He sooooo had stuff to say.  But he just tried to pay attention to class and that actually sorta paid off.  Tina then asked Tyke some questions and they started chatting.  Well most of you won't guess the topic of conversation that arose.  Karla and Tyke began talking about Tyke's blog and then Tina asked about it.  She has been hearing about it a lot so she wanted to read it.  So Tyke ended up giving her the URL and they talked some more about it.  She asked if he didn't want her to read it and he said that maybe a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't have but not now.  Now it is fine.  So she obviously knows what is a highly repeated topic of conversation.  But Tyke decided he doesn't care.  It's not like he really has anything to lose.  He has told her pretty much everything he feels in The Letter and then not long after that showed her the music video he made of Amazed which was a blatant reference to her.  So if she hasn't been totally freaked out yet, then he probably doesn't have anything to worry about.  And it isn't like she is going to have a change of heart anytime soon and realize what a great guy Tyke is cuz that just never happens.  Of course it could happen, but hanging onto that hope is idiocy in the mind of Tyke.  So now he will talk about something new now, especially since she may read the blog.  Not tonight cuz the basketball game is tonight but sometime maybe yes.  So hey, if you are reading this Tina, hope you enjoy it.  Well Tyke's day progressed pretty nicely.  Purdy was back at school today but Dotti was not because of DECA.  Nor was Haras.  So it was just Tyke and Purdy in english.  They decided that after school Tyke would drive Purdy around to get flowers and stuff at Party 4 Less cuz she was not going to have her car.  Purdy seemed surprised for Tyke's offer but he wasn't just doing it to be nice.  He wanted to be able to just hang out with somebody after school and of course Purdy is fun to hang out with.  Well as goes Tyke's luck, plans changed.  After school Purdy was telling Tyke how her bro wasn't awake when she left in the morning so she didn't know if he actually went to school.  And since he needed the car she wasn't going to have it.  So that is why Tyke was in the picture.  Well after waiting for her bro to come to the car and calling his cell and such she came to the conclusion that he was at home.  Thus she would just go home and then get Ekul to go with her instead of Tyke.  So Tyke got in his car and went home.  Kind of a rainy, dismal, foggy drive.  He waved at Shawna when he passed her but that was the highlight.  The music was good but it didn't make it so great that he had fun.  So he was in an odd mood.  Kinda dazed or numb again.  He has been out of it a lot of times since The Letter.  This may be totally coincidental but it is still true.  Well anyway he just came home and had an incredible urge to blog.  He is in love with this blog.  As he told Karla, if he could marry his blog, he would.  Which is sad.  Cuz he would be marrying words and an internet site which is visited by very few visitors.  Less than 400 in a week or so.  Which is actually a good number but that doesn't mean that his blog is viewed by random people.  Tyke is looking forward to Tolo.  This year he feels pretty secure about, first off a girl asking him.  And second, a girl he wants to ask him to ask him.  He has been asked once, last year, but it was a totally random girl really and he really didn't want to go.  So he didn't.  He felt really bad about doing so but he still did it.  It is hard to say no.  Maybe not for everyone but for Tyke it is.  He really doesn't ever want to do that.  It would be great if tolo ended up being better than homecoming.  Who knows if there is any chance of that though?  Well, he better not get ahead of himself.  It is still a long ways away though and it certainly is not a foregone conclusion that someone will ask him.  No need to worry.  Hey, they already planned out the Tolo group anyway, right?  Speaking of stuff, Skippy just reminded Tyke of Operation G-Force.  That failed fast.  Way too fast.  Still a total failure for Tyke in fact.  Which is unfortunate.  Cuz Tyke and G-Force would go well together.  This blog hasn't said anything real great so he will come back later tonight after basketball and then hopefully have some interesting things to write.  Bye for now. (*forced smile)

      It is too bad that the days Tyke is getting tired of now are soon going to be looked back upon with a feeling of regret.  Tyke can really see himself looking back on his high-school days and just regretting many things he did and didn't do.  It is one of those things where he really could have just applied himself more in school and that might have paid off or maybe just asking a girl to a dance one year or just anything.  But he has an unfortunate feeling that he has just passed up so many opportunities in life that he will never get back.  And also has made some stupid decisions.  He knows that one thing he could look back on and be disappointed with is that he tried to hard to please other people instead of pleasing himself.  That is something he knows now that he can't get too caught up on though and really it is not an entirely awful thing anyway.  At least someone is getting pleased (*smirk).  Well not sure where that came from but Tyke is in kind of a daze right now for some reason.  Probably because of going to the basketball game against Bellevue tonight.  Of course he saw Tina there.  And it really seems to Tyke that she is being less forward with him.  Kind of avoiding him you could say.  Now, it is hard to say as even pre-The Letter she probably wouldn't have said much if anything to him at the game tonight but Tyke is just piecing things together.  Like today before school he walked next to her on the way to class and she didn't say anything and barely even acknowledged him.  Luckily, Frederique came and was sort of a mutual acquaintance to talk to so they both were laughing and talking but it was still sorta awkward.  But really Tyke is wondering if he did something bad by telling her.  Cuz he is realizing now how much he loves spending any time with her and how it really does lighten up his day no matter how he felt before.  So, you can imagine how troubling it can be when she is there but is not there, if that makes any sense.  And Tyke still tries to make chit-chat but there just isn't always a paddle on the other side hitting the ball back to him (attempted analogy to Pong that probably failed).  Nonetheless, he trudges on and this blog needs to resurge into its superior status once again!  RISE UP MY WONTON!  Lead me to your place of desire!  Four score and seven years ago Tyke Turner was not alive.  Four hours and seven minutes ago Tyke Turner was in a chair eating licorice (both black and red for your information).  The day was normal.  No real excitement.  Dotti (new spelling by the way) and Tyke hung out in 4th period to the chagrin of their 4th period teacher.  Actually, there was no chagrin-ing but they still hung out.  3rd period kinda blew at times.  Other times were alright.  And Haras sat next to Tyke today (gotta mention Haras, come on!).  Good old Amed made a nice comment on mANUS and it just made Tyke think, yeah attaboy.  The best part is hardly anyone heard it.  Those comments are the best.  The sneaky wicked ones that go under the radar of most but get pinged by the sonar of others.  Tyke has good sonar.  He always picks up on things.  That is a lie cuz nobody is an always.  And nobody is a never either.  Everyone lies in the middle of the Something Spectrum.  Tyke is actually planning on maybe going (yeah tough to plan maybes but they can be planned...but not babies [rhymes]).  Well Amed and Kinker might make the trip with him.  That would be cool.  Any ladies dying to make the sensual trip to the cacophonous city of Bellevue?  If so, just sign on the dotted line and then cut your permission slip out and turn it in to Tyke Turner c/o   Hot Guys R Us 123 Fake St.  Anywhere, USA 90210  That should be enough, but make sure you include a $5 deposit.  No CODs but flashing is accepted.  Wow, Tyke is being weird now.  He has totally changed how he is talking and what it is about.  He got pointed out to him how he always talks to himself in his blog but he types it out as if there is some problem with him.  Well...there is...yeah...that's right...you know.  Nothing else blogworthy probably tonight.  Really Tyke's whole life has been demmed blogworthy by him though.  He talks about anything and everything.  As is the life of a kinker...er, blogger.  Sex sells and sex teaches according to Amed and Tyke.  Oh yeah, for english everyone has to write 3 Haikus.  Tyke has already started on his.  He is going to write about his Wonton (wink wink "boing boing") and will most likely do one about Tina.  Hopefully they all turn out well.  He likes writing stuff like that.  He considers himself a great writer when he gets to let loose his imagination and comical side.  But when it is about something stuffy it is just so hard to make it good.  However, that is the sign of a good writer.  Making the bland the grand.  And so on and so forth.  And nobody knows it but me...

      Say hello to my lil friend-Monday!  Actually Monday and Tyke aren't exactly friends but more of acquaintances that say hi to each other in the halls and such.  Monday came in with a "Reeee-errrrrr...reeeee-errrrr!!!"  That was the sound of his alarm clock and not the winsome wail of the big red fire engine.  He lumbered out of bed and drained his MW in the broom before going back and making his bed (if ya really wanna know what MW is then ask him but be warned).  Well after he got to school he went over to Skippy's car and ended up just sitting there.  They didn't really even talk but it was warm in there so they didn't need to.  Then Tyke got out when the bell rang and he had told Macaroon that he would bring a tennis racket for him to use in physics and give it to him in the morning.  Well Macaroon wasn't there so he just decided to leave it leaning up on the side of the car next to Macaroon's spot.  Then Tyke walked with Tina to math class as usual and they chatted and played games and such (yeah) and then he walked with her after class as usual and then he went to second period.  He and Kinker and Triple Threat talked and shtuff.  Then he left that period to go meet up with Purdy and walk with her to 3rd.  Well he talked to Macaroon on the way there and Tyke asked him if he got the racket.  And Macaroon was like, "oh that was for me?"  He said that he had told Dr. Phil in the morning that "oh somebody left a racket there next to his spot."  Tyke immediately went into "ARE YOU F*ING KIDDING ME?" mode to make sure Mac realized he was a moron.  He got the point and at lunch he gave the racket he got after 3rd period and gave it to Tyke.  So at least he didn't lose a racket too.  He already lost his bball on Friday.  Well 3rd and 4th periods were great cuz they entailed not doing shit.  Just talking girl talk with Purdy and Dottie.  Ya know, the use.  Tyke is such a girl, its hilarious!  Ahhh, good times, good times.  But seriously folks, good times.  After school Tyke did nothing again.  Came home and after a while he talked to Karla.  They talked for most of the night really.  They started doing would you rather's and Tyke came up with an insanely good one.  Here it is: would you rather go through an entire 24 hours in the body and mind of your biggest crush ever or have your biggest crush ever go through an entire 24 hours in your body and mind?  Good, ain't it?  And all Tyke's idea really.  He realized post-delivery that it sorta resembles Being John Malkovich but this is different still.  More like being Tina Tight-shirt.  Well actually it would be Tina being Tyke.  Cuz that is how he would pick it.  For her to go inside him for a day and find out how he truly feels around her and all of that kind of shizz.  Not that it would change her thinking-well it isn't possible anyway-but it would at least open her eyes to being more sensitive about things.  Tyke talked to Dr. Phil also during the night and they ended up getting on the subject of how it is hard when you like someone and they don't like you back.  Tyke immediately said, "TELL ME ABOUT IT!!!"  Haha, that was funny.  Then he progressed to recant his list of lady-friends he had been seriously enveloped in but to no avail.  Here is the list: 1st and 3rd grade Karla.  4th grade Carmen O'Neill.  5th grade Haras.  6th grade Haras and then Rachel.  7th Rachel.  8th Ali.  9th-present Tina.  It is a solid list right there.  Some great gals on it.  But if your name is not on the list, don't worry, you are still most likely a great friend of Tyke's but he just can't be all out there liking everyone now can he?  This blog is sorta disappointing to him because compared to the last couple of days it is not that long and Tyke himself loves to read long blogs.  But he has run out of things to say.  OH!  He just remembered how he was talking to Dr. Phil about blogs and how Tyke is good at his.  Then Tyke said Dr. Phil should have an Asian blog, or XANGA, and the doc said that he couldn't cuz it wouldn't be interesting to read nor would it accomplish anything.  But anyway they both agreed that Tyke's blog was just his diary.  And then Tyke realized that he is a girl.  He keeps a diary and talks about the opposite sex all the time.  And gets all sentimental and shizz.  And not to mention the fact that he posts it all over the internet and even put his blog up on a site to rate it (which by the way was a total failure to do since none of the votes are being counted for some reason).  But he also realized he doesn't care.  Cuz that is just the kind of person he is.  And it allows for some humorous moments.  Like his singing.  It is always loved by everyone.  How many people feel comfortable enough to just start singing songs to anyone around?  Or how many people have the balls to just flat out tell their MONSTER CRUSH how much they think about him/her and all of that stuff you already know?  Not many.  Tyke is one of a select few.  Be proud you know him.  Be proud you read his blog.  And most importantly remember...don't worry...be happy.  Tear...

      Sunday means the end of an era.  Or at least a week.  Yes folks, another week has gone by in Tyke's life.  It started boring but just got progressively better.  Nothing like just hanging out and talking to people.  Tyke just realized that he has done over 50 blogs in his life.  That is a lot.  It could be more than like 70 even.  So he has really been pouring his heart out for a while now.  And it really is rewarding.  The time he puts into this blog is not totally known but he really does try to put his focus on making his life sound somewhat entertaining when it is not and to make it a joy to read.  And from some responses he has been successful.  Today was a good day for Tyke.  Got up around 11 and that was nice.  He watched some football and talked to his parents.  Then he ate and talked online.  Then he left to get tapes for his videocamera at Farget.  That means that he now can do more taping.  Which means he has to get some new ideas for shows or whatever.  The public is anxiously awaiting his next venture!  And so is he actually.  He needs some good ideas (and the MTV Cribs idea needs to be reworked so that it would actually be entertaining).  After getting the tapes he went down to Barnes and Noble to get some extra credit for English.  There was a poetry reading and approximately 45 students or so were there.  All in this little corner of the store.  And some weird poems were presented.  The one with the 'birds in the bog' was good and so was the one about how girls get told how much they are loved by their 'beaus and boyfriends' or something like that.  Mainly because it reminded him of his situation with Tina.  Not that it is really a situation anymore.  But as you can see, he still cannot get her out of his head.  She is a daily subject of conversation for him really.  Amed tried to tell him that he shouldn't spend time agonizing over her.  Well, he isn't 'agonizing' persay anyway but he is just thinking about her.  And really there isn't any other girl that he knows of that he could spend time swooning.  Unless there is some girl withholding information from him.  And that is wrong.  So very wrong.  If this is true (and most likely Tyke thinks it is not) and the girl reads this blog then take this advice.  Find a way to let him know, albeit casually, that you have interest.  Chances are he will show an interest in talking about it.  Actually, he doesn't want to be a "tease" (wow never thought he would be calling himself a tease) so maybe you should just casually let him know of your desire.  One thing that Tyke has worried about is that girls might be scared of him because of how everybody knows about his love for Tina and all.  So they might think that he won't truly care about them.  Well that has bugged him.  He thinks he remembers (although this might have just been a dream cuz one year he had a dream that he got asked to Tolo by this cool girl and he awoke the next day thinking it was true and then at school he realized that it wasn't and that sucked) this one time when in freshman year he believes he was told that Haras might ask him to Tolo and he got pretty excited.  Tyke and Haras never talked about it or anything (in fact they still haven't talked about it so this is the first time...Hey Haras, how ya doing?) but Tyke was just told by one of his friends that she was going to ask him.  Then he later was told by this same friend that she didn't want to ask him cuz Tina was gonna be in their group and she thought that Tyke would just spend the whole time focused on Tina.  That was totally untrue though if Haras thought that (and sorry if this sounds like Haras was being mean cuz she wasn't and she's great and she reads this blog).  But anyway the point is that Tyke focuses on Tina now because that is who he feels deeply for and even though she doesn't show interest in him no other girl has either so there is no need for Tyke to start thinking about a new girl.  Get it?  Got it?  Good.  Ummm...oh yeah the poetry reading.  Well Tyke and Dottie saw each other and walked around B&N some and just chatted it up like the use (pronounced like luge but it is more like you-ge).  So then they all congregated around the reader and he went to work.  Tyke and Karla sat next to each other and they talked some and that was fun.  Tyke and Dottie texted each other for most of the time though.  It was funny cuz Tyke started talking about having a 4some with Dottie, Purdy, and Tina (ya know usual topics of conversation) and then it started talking about it being a dream.  And then it came to be that it was just a dream with Tyke and Tina.  And he was like, "Whoa I just had a dream two nights ago about Tina."  So that was ironic.  But basically it was just Tyke talking to Dottie about how he wanted to have sex with her and how he was horny and stuff like that (again, usual topics of conversation).  Well Tyke has been rambling a lot again this blog.  Actually you can't really call it rambling when this is pretty much all his blog is.  So now he will call it blogging.  So Tyke has been blogging a lot this blog.  But the blogging parts are sometimes the most entertaining so he can't leave those out.  He basically likes stuff and doesn't like other stuff.  Let's just leave it at that.  But he likes you so don't worry.  Unless you're Kram 2 (he might have initially been Kram 1 but if so he has been demoted to 2 cuz he isn't good) in which case he doesn't like you.  Kram Yarg this is.  Well, actually Tyke still doesn't necessarily not like you.  It is just he hates what you do.  You have something that many people would kill for (Tyke isn't the only one is he? just kidding he wouldn't kill...or would he!?!?!?!  you'll never know!!! MWAHAHAHAHA) and yet you just are an ass to it.  A complete ass.  Balls up and be a real man about it.  Actually no, don't.  You don't deserve Tina.  Tina deserves good.  Oh no, enough of this.  Yet another blogging job done on this blog by Tyke.  He's gonna go eat some more wheat thins, finish talking to Amed and then go to Tyke's bed.  Ahhh Tyke's bed...where all good things go at night, or during the day really.  And by good things he most obviously means_____(leaving ya on your own for this one).

      Saturday January 10, 2004 would not be considered a social day for Tyke Turner.  In fact he hardly saw any people that he actually "socialized" with.  He got up a little before 10 and got his pelo trimmed.  He still doesn't exactly understand why he and his family go to this guy in Bellevue for a haircut when Tyke's hair, at least, would be quite easy to cut on their own.  Not to mention the fact that it would save money and also the guy doesn't do a great job either but he is a cool guy.  It don't matter in the end.  All that matters is what Tyke writes in his blog really.  He got back home and talked to Amed "no longer" Annoying a little bit online but he was the only one on so he is all Tyke talked to.  Tyke watched some football and there were some real good plays and that was just boding well for the rest of his day.  He then got in the shower naked and cleaned himself up and then dried off his naked body.  Then he un-nakeded himself by putting on his clothes for "work."  Ha!  So not work but whatever it might end up being his job in a few months.   He got some MickeyD's on the way and he had a little lapse in his driving skills while in the drive-thru and nearly drilled the car in front of him.  But he didn't and the driver didn't even notice.  Hehe.  So then he drank his monster shake and was off.  He got to KING 5 at about 3:30 and right away he was put to work.  Actually that is a lie.  He just went and sat at this computer and watched some games and stuff while waiting to be asked to do something.  Then came the 5:30 show and he just went into the control room for this one.  He watched it from there with the headphones on and all.  Seeing some behind-the-scenes action even though he really has seen everything at least once by this point.  Then they went back to their place of work and did some more prep before the 6:30 show and then he went down to the studio for that one and stayed around for the teasers they do for later shows and the Sonics halftime update on KONG.  Then he went back upstairs and once the Sonics game started he actually got to do some work.  Which he was looking forward to do.  He logged the game, which for those of you who either don't know or remember simply means that he takes down plays and times of happenings in the game.  Taking notes and stuff all the while.  This was actually important again for Michael King (the shadowed sports anchor) as with all of the games going on at the moment there was no way he could really devote much time to all of the ones he should be watching.  So having Tyke there meant they could get great stuff from that game as well as get the best of the rest.  So Tyke did that and it went into OT so it was even more work.  Then Tyke picked out his highlights and told Michael all the important plays and scores which helped him write his script for that part.  Then Tyke was basically done other than checking factoids and such for Michael.  Tyke has an awesome memory and knowledge of sports so he is good to have around.  And now KING knows this.  In fact, Tyke was pretty much offered an internship by King.  So that means that although he won't get paid it will be incredible experience and also give him some superb connections.  Oh and by pretty much Tyke means that he was told that when he is in college or whatever he should come by and be an intern.  So it was one of those light-hearted truthful offers.  Which means he should be able to stay around at KING for the summer.  That would be awesome.  However, he still isn't positive on it.  But if he did he might be able to go to Safeco and those places along with getting to work on stuff.  He really does know how to do everything so far he has seen Michael do.  Like he could pretty much do his job if he needed.  And that is pretty cool to think about.  Like totally awesome actually.  Just think about it, "Tyke Turner is coming live to you from Safeco Field where your Seattle Mariners have just captured the AL West crown and are on the path to a Fall Classic trip.  More at 11."  See, he already knows what to do and the technology is easy to use too.  Not to mention that the people at KING seem to like him.  Well he finally left at about 11 so he racked up 8 more hours.  He now has done 20 overall.  And that is in like 4, maybe 5 trips.  4 he thinks though.  Ahh yes, now for what you have all been waiting for.  Tyke Turner's miscellaneous tidbits of information.  Well last night Tyke had a nice little bit of a dream.  All he really remembers is that this one part was awesome.  Any guesses as to why it was awesome?  Yeah, you prolly can sorta guess it.  Tyke really only remembers the small portion where he was kissing Tina.  And by kissing he means making out.  And by making out he means making out, nothing more.  HA!  Gotchya with that one didn't he?  Maybe not, and if not then it was probably stupid.  So ignore it.  But yeah, they were kissing and caressing and such.  What a lovely time that was.  If only it were true...BUT it ain't so no need to spend time dwelling on what could be or hoping for something that is not going to happen.  No matter Tina's availability, her and Tyke are not going to hook up.  Tyke has totally accepted this as fact and for those of you who tell him that she might change, thanks but it won't.  And the last thing Tyke needs right now is to be trying to hold onto something that isn't there.  But since Tyke doesn't want himself thinking about how great it would be for him and Tina to be together he will leave that up to you, his adoring friends.  So just think about it all the time.  And maybe even write stories about it.  If someone wrote a story about it then Tyke would definitely read it.  All is well in Tyke-land.  How are things in you-land?

      This is technically the second blog for Saturday, yet really this is the only one that goes into detail of the action-packed Saturday (sarcasm definitely).  Today kinda was an unexpected lax day.  It started off with the Tykester going all night until the late hour of 11:50.  Of course he is talking about sleeping.  What else would he be doing?  Come on.  Apparently the Macaroonanator gave him a call while he was sleeping (he calls early a lot) and first his mom came in while he was sleeping and of course woke him up.  She didn't know that though cuz as she came in she asked in a whisper if he was awake and he opened his eyes to look at her but then quickly realized that he shouldn't do this so he closed them quickly and she then believed he was still sleeping.  Later on though, Tyke's papa came down and also checked to see if he was awake.  So that woke him up also.  So Macaroon basically woke up Tyke twice with one phone call.  Thanks you bastard.  When you don't go to bed until after 1, when would you expect to get up???  He didn't even get that much sleep.  Like 10 hours or so.  Barely even in double digits.  So at like 1 he went over to Macaroon's.  Joining them became Amed and then in an odd twist, DCups came along.  He hadn't hung out with them since summer really.  But it was cool.  They decided to hit up Coug Ridge for some bball.  As they were going outside Kinker finally rolled up on 24s.  Well, not really.  Not even close actually but still.  Tyke was not on in the cold weather when they played 21.  He did pretty well but of course Kinker was going all out compared to the aggressiveness of the rest of the players.  Not that he was going all out but he was playing harder than the rest as usual.  Amed played his usual style.  Which is pretty much indescribable.  Not necessarily in a good way though.  He is just fun to watch.  And he gets a scary face sometimes.  But if you ever want to see some serious arc on a shot...just watch Amed.  That ball goes way up there.  Then they played HORSE and Tyke was off.  He was still tired from 21 and not having anything to eat other than a nAsTy! like protein bar or something like that.  That is still no excuse though.  He got dethroned.  It was a much different game being behind Kinker rather than anyone else.  But he still just flat out missed his shots.  So then he and Amed started their one on one game.  Can you believe that Amed truly believes he can beat Tyke one on one???  Amed is better than you might think at basketball but still, Tyke used to play.  Back in the days of 5th and 6th grade he was pretty much Michael Jordan.  But really Tyke should be able to take Amed pretty handily if he doesn't completely brick every shot.  And if he doesn't just get tired from chasing down loose balls.  You'll hear the results first here though.  Don't worry.  Well, then Tyke, Kinker, and Amed went to BSquare.  Amed finally returned his pants there and apparently argued with them to allow him to get a full refund.  Amed is just like that ya know?  *Here is a little sidenote...Tyke for some reason just had a flashback to about a week ago when he and his mom were talking about their trip to Europe when summer starts (by the way if somebody really wants to go and would be willing to pay their own airfare Tyke's mom would be fine with him/her coming along) and she then started talking about current fashions.  So anyway, she got onto the subject of some of the clothes that girls/women wear now and she said the words pubic hair.  Right after that there was quite an awkward silence.  So then Tyke left and went downstairs.  That is all.  Ok, where was he?  Well Tyke looked at some shoes he wants to get at The Bon.  His bro has ones similar to them or maybe they are the same but he still likes them.  He thinks he would wear them a lot.  Basically loafers.  They had lunch at Orange Julius.  Those smoothies are really quite good.  Strawberry is awesome.  The nachos were pretty spicy but they did the job.  Tyke really wants to just eat stuff now.  Now he is hungry.  He really hates eating at 11:30.  It is just like he should be doing something other than eating, ie sleeping, and then whenever he eats something he gets more energy so he is even less likely to go to sleep.  And then he talks online so he ends up staying up until 1 every night and that is not advantageous.  But he likes to be pensive and was Saturday night.  Seeing as he did nothing and was hella tired (he fell asleep again on his chair watching TV).  So he just sat around and thought about stuff that was on his mind.  He didn't actually accomplish anything by doing this but it is alright.  Nothing was made worse.  Late in the night Macaroon actually got online and he talked to Tyke some.  Not sure what their plans are for Sunday but Macaroon really wants to do anything.  So hopefully they do something fun.  Tyke is planning on making a new mix soon.  Maybe tomorrow if he has time.  He has some ideas for what to put on it but of course he is always up for suggestions of something that is really good.  Dr. Phil probably has some ideas for that.  Well, Tyke's going to go eat some stuff and then probably think about things while he dozes off to sleep.  Here's to the night...

      Friday was awesome!!!  It started off gay as Tyke's first period teacher made him go take the final in a different room along with a bunch of other people so Tyke didn't get to say goodbye really to Tina in her last day in his class for the year.  Pretty much their time together will diminish to hardly anything.  With some people they still hang out if they don't have classes but with Tyke and Tina it isn't exactly that.  Oh well, he has moved on.  Speaking of moving on, Tyke walked right on to his next class and final final.  It was Photo.  It was fun to do.  3 people making 2 pictures, dry humping them and then matting them.  Not too hard.  And it wasn't but they did end up spending a little time after class humping it.  But it got humped and that is all that matters.  Tyke went out and walked with Kinker in the rain.  Tyke went and talked to some folks and then dropped his bag off at his car while progressing towards the hangout of Purdy/Dotti.  Purdy's bro had taken her car and she was mad cuz she needed stuff out of it.  It was a good time.  But anyway after a while Tyke went home by himself and just did nothing really.  Then the time came nearer and nearer.  His big game at the Kramm (good Kram's new spelling to differentiate between the two since the other Kram isn't bad so he doesn't like using the good and bad preface) household was scheduled for 3 PM.  Well Tyke and Kinker couldn't get a hold of Toxic Old.  So then they needed to find a replacement.  And they found a pretty good one in Big Twigg.  He certainly gave another size advantage so that was good.  Purdy and Haras came over before anybody else and they chatted a little.  Then, upon suggestion, Tyke busted out his superman shirt and cape.  This is the really tight shirt for those of you who are confused as to what Tyke means.  This shirt is a PJ top for kids about 5 years old.  And yeah, Tyke put it on.  He attached the cape too.  Pretty much one of the most amazing sites you'll ever see in your life.  Just look at the pics/vids if you don't believe so.  Haras and Purdy really seemed to be cracked up by it.  As they say, all is fair in love and war...and super tight Superman shirts.  Tyke wore the shirt to the court and was immediately able to intimidate the opposition.  They were shaking in their Team USA jerseys.  Team USA may have had uniforms but Team Good had the style and presence on the court.  Right away Tyke was feeling it.  Comedy that is, not his shot.  He was just hitting those one-liners and just living it up for the camera.  Ya know, doing it Amed style.  He was really looking good out there...once again not shooting-wise but appearance wise.  His uni was awesome.  Well, the game got underway and it was a close brawl at first.  But then the better team started to pull away.  Thanks to the dominating inside presence of Tyke Turner, Team Good just kept hitting the fadeaway jumpers over Karl Malone.  Stockton and Mullin kept trying to get their outside game going and to get some good ball movement but as Haras so rightly put, "pass incomplete."  Haras and Purdy were great cheerleaders for Team Good.  They obviously shocked Team USA by rooting against them and wanting the better team to win.  Their ability to cheer and videotape at the same time was unbelievable.  Real talent right there folks, you gotta love this game.  And those girls.  As the game droned on, Team Good was losing their touch.  Tyke couldn't find the bucket and Kinker, who had pretty much been dominating was losing some of his presence although still leading Team Good.  Kinker really did lead the team to the W.  MVP right there.  It finally came down to OT as it was all knotted up until Kinker made back to back jumpers and got Team good the win with a score of like 26-24 or something like that.  An unbelievable game really.  Hard-fought battle on both ends and Team USA really deserves some credit for sticking to it and not giving up even though their skills did not match the wily combination of speed, slash, strike that Team Good employed.  Coach was really proud of the guys.  Gave them all an extra $3.4 million bonus.  Not to mention exercising the option for 2005.  That will be a great decision.  Nobody can beat this duo of Kinker and Tyke.  Especially if Tyke can actually hit an outside shot.  Which he couldn't...he kinda choked in front of the national audience.  He wasn't nervous.  He was just weak in his right arm for some reason and then just couldn't make anything.  All in all he was pleased with his performance.  And since he seems to have kept his fans entertained while doing so, he has been a success.  Really a great activity that was.  He looks forward to many more matchups.  Maybe on a dry court with a full sized hoop and regulation ball.  That would make things easier for Tyke.  He could actually drive to the hoop without fear of falling.  That is why he just posted up every play.  Or stayed outside.  He was, oddly enough not a force on the boards as he usually is.  Probably because the ball was bouncing from like an 8*1/2 foot hoop so everybody could get to it easy.  But Team USA was athletic and quick.  They gave them a run for their money.  Tyke was truly worried at some points in the game.  But nonetheless they pulled it out.  Thanks to the wonderful fans and all of their support.  They couldn't have done it without your love and generosity.  Kudos..........Well, after that Tyke went home and showered.  Then he got his acceptance to WSU.  Not a surprise of course but it is good to know he doesn't have to do anything now but apply for another scholarship and financial stuff.  It is pretty much in the bag now.  After his Mexican Lasagna dinner Macaroon, Amed, Skippy, Kinker, and Big Twigg came over before the boys bball game.  It was fun.  Just hung out a bit and made fun of Amed like usual.  The game was alright but kinda boring actually.  No girls to talk to the whole time.  The cheerleading squad was above par since Haras and the good team (not Team Good though) were at the girls game.  Had it not been at Liberty, Tyke probably would have gone.  But that is a long drive to talk to her for just a short period of time really.  And it was still funny hearing Amed's crazy and inane comments to the Libert-arians.  Wait!  Amed should go to Libert-ay if he is a Libertarian.  That traitor!!!!  Maybe he is a spy!!!  Eat his Russian face.  Well, after the game 4 of the guys went back to Tyke's and they played some games and then Macaroon left and Kinker, Tyke, and Big Twigg watched some of Tyke's vids and played some cards.  Then they left and Tyke blogged.  And his eyes are literally so tired that the words on here are blurred.  Probably not a good sign.  He is blinded by his love.  Love of an inanimate object that is online.  That is just sick!

      What up?  Tyke's back fellas and felines.  Nothing much more happened but he is still gonna talk some more.  He told his mom about his ticket.  It was actually a funny conversation when he looks back on it.  He first told her at dinner and she looked at him with wide glaring eyes and he was like, "Ummm...don't worry it won't go on my record."  Yeah, that was just kinda like, oh shit say something good now.  But then it was all cool cuz he explained stuff and then explained where it happened.  She actually said, "Oh, thats good you got it then cuz I even speed there."  Tyke was like, "yeah...reaaaaaal good."  Well, that worked out for the best.  No problems.  Other than the fact that he has to do community service and such sometime.  But Tyke is going to be very happy when his final tomorrow morning is over.  His 1st period final that is.  Cuz then it means a fun 2nd period final (photo) and then off to rest up, eat, and get ready for his big game.  That is going to be a battle.  But the Quah has a serious size advantage and should also be able to dominate the outside game if they can hit their shots.  Fatigue should not be a problem of course.  This is going to be great.  And Tyke, Kinker, and Toxic Old are going to have the fine cheerleading core of Haras and Purdy there.  It may not be right for them to totally cheer on only the Quah-ites but still they should give some good support.  But the time is tomorrow.  And it is late.  This was pointless to write.  He is not even focused on it now.  He really needs sleep.  He has totally neglected that this week.  Earlier today he fell asleep watching TV in "his" chair and then he had one of those weird moments.  All of a sudden his body shook violently and then BOOM! he woke up.  It was freaky.  It happens occasionally, mainly when napping on accident.  Not sure why it happens.  But it does.  So he is going to try and get some nappy nap sleep sleep.  So wish Tyke luck!  Actually don't need to cuz this is really not a big deal ya know.  Just bragging rights.  And oh will they ever be bragging rights!

      This is an early blog because there have been some early events unfolding today.  First off, Tyke had his AP Gov final today.  All in all...it wasn't as horrible as some people had said and are saying.  The test seemed to start out hard and then got kinda easier.  Tyke thought he remembered the court case questions pretty well.  But he still will probably end up getting like a 58%.  Which should end up being like a B or so.  That would be cool if he did get an A- in there but there probably isn't any chance of that.  Then he had then english presentation go.  And they got through only one freaking presentation.  And they kinda stopped that one short too.  After that was over, Tyke, Purdy, and Dotti all went out to lunch together.  A lovely decision to do so.  They went to Goodfella's and it was awesome.  As usual.  Tyke decided to just stick with the turkey'n'cheese today and got a drink and it was a fine decision.  Mmmmmm...not to mention the price is solid.  Cheaper than Subway...and better too.  They just chatted it up like good friends.  Reminiscing about old times...looking to the future.  Just girl talk with a guy really.  Then they went back to the school to get all the cars and they went and talked to Nullification Crisis.  Her baby is growing up.  Just like most kids do.  Get bigger and older and wiser.  And stronger...than yesterday...ahh what a great song.  Tyke and the crew listened to that yesterday at Ungy's house.  After Tyke said his loving departures to Purdy and Dotti (and no Tyke was not trying to kiss her when leaving) he called up the Macaroon man.  He drove on overs to his house and met up with Fejj, Amed, Dr. Phil, and K-caj.  They all played Halo and Fejj and Tyke were a good team but of course no match for Dr and Macaroon.  Macaroon had the shooting down.  But Tyke is a good shot at sniping too.  After that they went to play basketball.  They ended up going down to Lakemont to play.  But it was still fun.  Tyke was the force again.  He didn't win either games of 21 cuz he got tipped incessantly.  But he very easily could have if he didn't get tipped more than 20 times.  Amed somehow pulled out a miraculous first round victory.  But the second round saw quite a change.  The Dr. Phil Lelee made his move to stop Amed's presence down low.  And man did it work.  The "shadow D" was unstoppable.  Amed got so angry and lost complete focus.  On his free throws he just ended up throwing the ball at Dr. and then everytime that happened Dr. Phil ran up to Amed when he got the ball back and just bear hugged him.  No stopping that.  Amed lost it all.  The faces he made and the vein popping out of his head was priceless.  Not to mention the fact that he was yelling and throwing bows and everything.  It was awesome.  Then they played HORSE (PIG actually).  That was Tyke's game yet again.  Amed ended up sitting out because he couldn't take the presence of Dr. Phil out there.  Then he just shouted profane comments at Dr. while he was shooting.  They were stupid yet hilarious.  He kept yelling pretty boy.  That was great.  Dr. Phil somehow made a surprising bid to the final round after Tyke knocked out all the other players but one earlier.  Dr. Phil's no jump shots were starting to get hot but Tyke quickly stopped that and made them as well...then Phil lost it.  So Tyke made his move.  Since Lelee's Prove It was done with Tyke had to just get him to miss a shot and it was over.  So he just went for the easy bank shot and that did him in.  It was a great day again.  Then they played 3 on 3.  Tyke, Amed, and K-caj took the opposers.  Tyke's ball control, penetrating abilities, and ability to dish to the open man were incredible and just unstoppable.  He even finished at the hoop very well.  A solid performance definitely.  Then they all went back to Macaroon's and split up.  Then Tyke went home and fuck the police.  Stupid motherfucking cops sitting out waiting for a hot guy to drive by and guess what, one did.  Just sitting on his leather-bound ass letting gravity take care of his beer belly and his cue-ball head.  Fuck him.  48 in a 35.  That's nothing.  That's hardly even speeding.  Tyke even was nice enough to brake when he saw the cop.  But the guy still got him from 978 feet away.  That seems like a long way.  But he still got hit with the $132 fine.  That's just gay.  So now he has to do traffic court or whatever.  The cop just told him to go see some officer at the school tomorrow and get it settled with her or something.  That was gay.  This is gay.  Damn stuff like this.  Cuz this goes on top of his bad grades so that is just like double kill.  And this double kill is like when you are one of the two people getting killed, not the one who killed two people.  That way is good.  Well, this is not fun,  He wishes he just could have a 4.0 and no tickets still.  That would be much better.  But anyway, Tyke still has the night ahead of him but he is really hungry so he is going to get something to eat.  He still isn't sure if the bball game against Ekul, etc is on tomorrow but it should be.  Gotta get that win.  Well, lunch was really fun today but no Friends night again.  And it is an hour long one too.  So it would have been more fun than usual.  Oh well, can't win em all.  But Tyke likes to win most.  If not all.  But since he lost this one he already can't win em all.

      Yeah, well today was just full of that Wednesday charm!  Tyke had a blast of a day, discounting the hell that was his physics final.  It really wasn't that bad...but Tyke knows he did poorly.  And he really wanted to do well.  But he probably did not.  After school he went home and then quickly was off to the land of Macaroon McGee.  He was joined by Amed, Kinker, Skippy, and Dr. Phil.  They started it off with some Halo but then moved outside to play some basketball.  That was a good time indeed.  Tyke has had blasts playing basketball so far this season.  Today they played 21 first and Kinker dominated the first game.  He really is a solid player and he plays hard which gives him a huge advantage.  The size and strength also gives him quite an advantage though.  But the second game Tyke should have won but he missed a bunch of pretty easy opportunities at a tip.  Nonetheless he continued on.  Well then they played HORSE.  And Tyke still owns HORSE.  Yep, he won yet again.  Undefeated in '04 now.  He just feels it.  After that Tyke went home and just hungz outz.  Of course there would be no studying tonight.  Not like that does anything.  There may be a correlation between studying and A's but that means nothing when you have a B-.  Well anyway, Tyke and Purdy talked and Ekul has been trying to get a basketball game going with good Kram and another player against Tyke and his crew of choice.  So today Tyke called Ekul back but he wasn't there so he left a message.  Tyke is teaming up with Kinker and hopefully Toxic Old (ttocS gnuoY).  That should be a pretty good team.  Tyke playing good defense and making his good passes should help out.  He can board pretty well too.  Just watch him jump.  And if they play shirts and skins then Tyke's team already has a huge advantage cuz how can you concentrate with Tyke's shirt off?  Just staring at all that man-muscle is like staring into the heart of a lion (cuz the heart is a muscle, ya know).  He is so ripped it isn't funny (that would work even if he wasn't ripped cuz if you think about it why would you laugh cuz he wasn't ripped???).  But nonetheless this part goes out to Amed, Tyke is a reall big piece of meat that should be eaten up.  Maybe with some steak sauce and you can even eat him raw.  Enough of that.  Also, another scary revelation today happened on the episode of the OC.  For all of you who watch listen up.  Ya know Oliver?  Yeah, well Tyke realized today that Tyke is Oliver.  Oliver even wrote Marissa a letter!!!!!  So really, this means nothing cuz most TV shows relate to everyone in some way.  That is why they get put on tv in the first place.  Because of the highly relatable characters.  It is tantamount to a show's success having relatable characters.  Time for a new topic.  Tyke and Oliver may be similar but Oliver is way crazier than Tyke.  Tyke ain't gonna kill himself or flaunt a gun or steal a girl from anyone.  OK, too much there.  Well tonight was fun.  Tyke has just sat around and talked and played basketball downstairs.  Watched a little TV.  Just stuff to make himself happy.  And then he talked with Haras.  She said one of the nicest things tonight about his blog.  It really made him feel great.  Just unbelievably special really.  One of those things where he knew he was doing something that was beneficial to people.  And there is no better feeling in the world than knowing that you have pleased another.  At least for Tyke.  Just to see that smile or hear that laugh or to gaze into their eyes and know that you have made at least that one moment better for them.  In this world where it often seems like there are so many stupid people and difficult choices, everyone needs someone to bring them back down to what truly matters.  It all comes down to pleasing yourself.  And for some, to please yourself you need to please others.  Just do something that allows you to see the grateful reaction from anybody.  The professional comedian must have some really great feelings.  Knowing that you go out and give people an escape from reality or just give a light-hearted view on reality has to be so fulfilling.  Tyke is sometimes too focused on pleasing others though as he has said before.  And he realizes that he may totally be contradicting a past blog but it is all about the current moment.  Live for the now and the future will follow.  Look to the future and the now will fall through (haha Tyke tried to make like a catchphrase there but it totally sucked).  Just add some levity to your situation.  Take some time out to just smile or laugh or reflect.  Music is so powerful.  It can influence moods and strengthen them.  But they can also give great advice.  It shows that others feel the same.  You are not alone.  You have support around you.  Sometimes you don't even know where it is.  But it is always there.  Sometimes it is just on the other side of a computer, or on some website.  Seek out Tyke and he will seek a way to make you happy.  Yeah, that's right...Tyke started a new paragraph.  One of the first times he has done that ever.  But he felt he needed to break up that prolonged thought.  Especially for those of you who got tired of it and needed something new.  Tyke right now though is really feeling something he is having troubles describing.  It is just like, he is smiling inside...nay, he is beaming inside.  This will make him sleep well tonight.  And he had a good talk with Skippy too.  Tonight was just a night full of great conversations.  Purdy was talkative which makes that a two-sided conversation.  And that is much better then Tyke doing all the talking.  Haras was a joy as mentioned before.  Skippy was great.  Amed, well actually they didn't talk about much.  But whatever.  Kinker has been offline for a while now so he hasn't told him his news for him.  But whatev again.  Tyke Turner.  Life is good for him right now.  School may be not good for him but he is happy.  Only one thing missing but that is less of a thought for him as of late.  Actually, not really.  He still daydreams and nightdreams about possibilities and all that.  It is something he really wants to find out there but he can't rush it or search for it either.  But he can't be down.  Friends are great too!  Tyke is just looking to find a girl that isn't taken now.  And one who isn't talking about all these guys she likes or thinks are really hot or whatever.  That gets kind of tiring by the way.  Tyke has apparently had hot friends for much of his life.  Cuz girls talk to him (directly and indirectly) about guys that Tyke hangs out with and how they are hot and how they wanna make out with them and all this stuff that is just like, "Hey whats up I'm Tyke.  I like girls.  I'm not a girl.  So don't expect me to not feel uncomfortable when you talk about guys in front of me.  And yes, I do feel uncomfortable."  Truthfully, this may sound dumb but it makes Tyke feel bad.  Kinda like he is just...well not hot.  And not that he thinks of himself as hot or anything (not that he thinks about appearance anyway) but still it is just sorta like...who knows...maybe inadequacy is the word.  Tyke is uncomfortable now.  He can't keep talking about this.  No more penetrations into his soul.  STOP!!! No penetration!!!  Good luck on finals.

      Ah yes, Tuesday Shmoozeday.  Today had some serious events to talk about.  Which may mean there will be more factual presentation than reflection in here.  But since nobody gives Tyke comments on what is better anyway, he will just go with his gut on this one.  So today started well with Tyke getting a good deal of talking done in his math class.  Tina and Karla were good company as usual.  Tyke felt on fire the whole day really...he was just spittin out some great one-liners and letting the good times roll.  Nothing really good comes to mind but it's enough so that you all can know that it was indeed funny (iwif).  But the rest of the day progressed smoothly.  Lunch was awesome today.  There were many a person there.  Tina, Purdy, Dotti, Kinker, Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Fejj, K-caj, etc.  Well Tyke sat with Purdy, Tina, and Dotti mainly and talked to them.  Oh, and Shawna was there too by the way.  But they didn't talk much.  Oh but Tyke did talk about how he was excited for HaikuFest04!!!  That is gonna be awesome.  He announced today he is gonna write 2 haikus about his wonton and one about Tina.  And yeah, Tina was there when he said that.  She asked Purdy who Tina was and then Purdy told Tina who Tina was.  So Tina knows Tina.  So yeah, thats kinda...out there and all.  Not to mention the whole text of this blog.  Yeah, pretty sure she (you if it is Tina who is reading this) has read this.  So, sorry might be the right word to say.  Or maybe, well that's how Tyke feels/felt.  Well, damn this might be stupid to say but Tyke feels the need to sorta explain something about this little situation he has felt.  Purdy told Tyke today at the Phys Review that Tina had read the blog and was a little freaked out by it (or maybe a lot freaked out, Tyke can't remember).  Well, right away Tyke's heart sunk.  He really feared that he had done something horrible.  He was thinking of the worst and what if they became awkward or she didn't want to ever be around Tyke.  That was a really scary feeling.  Not one he wants to feel again.  And that is why he is timid in writing all of this.  Because he is unaware if this is getting too personal for the ones that are mentioned in this primarily.  There is really only one person who could "take offense" to the comments in this blog.  And that would be Tina.  Cuz Tyke says some pretty serious and meaningful things.  And because this is public and just a totally un-private forum for these discussions.  But this is, as he has said before is just infotainment.  Information presented through a media forum that promotes interesting modicums of events (not a good usage of modicums but a great word nonetheless).  Tyke uses his blog to entertain the general public but he does so by amalgamating fact and interesting rambles to make a highly attractive "broadcast."  Damn talking online while writing this...Tyke keeps bouncing from here and other conversations so now he keeps forgetting what he was talking about here.  So let's just say that Tyke is sorry for any pain or a lack of comfort after reading these entries.  Maybe he should have a disclaimer before the text.  Like, The views herein expressed are mostly that of the author yet they do not intend to inflict any emotional damage to any person, especially female.  Proceed with caution.  Tyke is now going to talk about one of the best parts of his blog.  Namedropping.  Purdy, Haras, Kinker, Quesa.  Those four finebodied females and male were one hell of a physics review group.  Quesa doesn't read this so no need to mention her anymore but if she does read it, HERE SHE IS!!!!  However, Purdy, Haras, and Kinker do read it.  And there is nothing like being shown, if only glimpsed on something seen by lots of people.  That brings Tyke to another point before he talks about those people.  Tyke was on TV today.  Multiple times actually.  If you remember back to when Tyke first did his CE he went to a frat house at UW as his mentor was doing a story there and Tyke got used as a "frat guy" shooting pool.  So he was in both the teaser and a part of the actual clip.  Now it wasn't like he said anything or even actually made eye contact with the camera but he was still on camera some.  He was told to just shoot some pool when the camera rolled past him and the first time they did that he made 2 balls in and almost a 3rd.  But then that take wasn't great so they did a new one.  And this one Tyke totally botched it and the ball bounced off two sidepockets, almost a scratch.  And it made a bad noise.  But still, he was on TV and you weren't so (tongue sticking out noise with frowny eyes).  But back to people you know.  Tyke and Purdy were texting each other when Tyke was at home and he talked about how he dreams of seeing her in her one-piece for work and how hot she is and ya know, just the truth and all (no seriously it's the truth...or is it? well it could be either but since you aren't Tyke you don't know and since sometimes Tyke just says stuff for the comedic value you really don't know!!!!).  But yeah, those were good times.  And Haras and Tyke talked about...well not that much actually.  They talked about how Tyke can say just stupid things and they will be funny to Haras.  Haras is sooo awesome.  It is really great when you can be sooo stupid and inane but then even though it may not be funny to anyone else, that one person still finds it funny.  Haras is that one person.  And she is really nice so it is a double decker bus like the ones you see in England.  Not the ones you see in Washington (cuz there are none).  See, right there...that was probably pretty stupid but Haras is just so cool that it might have made her snicker to read.  Oh, and not to take anything away from Purdy or Dotti cuz they too laugh at stupid stuff of Tyke's and they also are reallly nice and super cool.  Haras, Purdy, and Dotti, are all tied for like the top spot in Tyke's black book (this black book is actually just a figure of speech and also it does not mean like past girlfriends or anything but he would date them...don't doubt that).  But still it is great to have super awesome friends.  And they are hot.  Purdy was pretty mcHOT today with her sexyyy new haircut and dressy-wear.  Haras was her usual gorgeous self and made every guy turn his head as she walked by.  Dotti was absolutely stunning decked out in Ross-wear with an UNBELIEVABLY fabulous pink backpack.  This buxom beauty can certainly get a rise out of the crowd.  Line might have been crossed with that last one.  Which probably means that this should be a quit for this blog.  Amed did his job again today, whatever that was.  And Kinker is really good at knowing what Tyke means to say and also he and Tyke make up great acronyms and stuff and can figure them out real quicklike.  Super fast like.  Tyke is about to P&P now too.  See, Kinker will prolly get that one too.  Go COUGS!!!

      What a Monday.  It was an early start for Tyke on Monday.  Actually it was late for a Monday but late considering it was a day off.  He got up at 9 knowing he was not going to start his paper for a while.  But imagine the irony when he started it around 10:30 and then just worked straight until noon.  He got 3 pages done in that span.  And he finished his paper around 3.  Right when Full House was coming on.  Great timing on his part.  Full House is such a great show.  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were so cute as Michelle.  And now they're just plain hot.  And Tyke's cousin might end up teaching them next year at NYU.  Cuz she might have to be the TA or whatever for a class that they would have to take.  But the point is that they are really cute as Michelle.  And man does that family ever hug and kiss!!!  They are like a newlywed couple except for the sex part.  And everything gets solved waaaaayyyyyy easy.  Like today DJ was having her 13th birthday party and there was this guy who DJ liked and Kimmee decided to get them to kiss by playing Spin the Bottle.  But then Kevin (the guy) spun the bottle and everybody but DJ jumped back so it automatically landed on her.  Then she got mad, etc.  But anyway DJ had a talk with Becca and they talked about her first kiss and how she will always remember it.  After that, DJ went downstairs and Kevin came back with the card that went with his present to her.  Then they went outside and ended up kissing and DJ was really excited and then they did a fade shot to end the show with the fade-in credits in that San Fran gold coming on.  The relevance to Tyke's life though is that she was all freaked about her first kiss at 13 and Tyke is 17 and he still hasn't had his first real kiss.  Yep, very true statement right there.  You could say that's weird but it isn't.  At least Tyke didn't think so.  Not that Tyke isn't like wanting to kiss someone.  He just hasn't.  Usually you kiss your significant other or partner but since Tyke hasn't had a serious girlfriend then he hasn't had anyone to kiss.  So that explains it.  To explain it well just sing these words: whatever happened to predictability?  The milk man, the paper boy, even MTV.  You miss your old familiar friends, waiting just around the bend.  That show rocks Tyke!  He almost gets knocked over he gets rocked so hard.  To digress, Tyke will talk about the rest of his day.  He did nothing.  Ok, that was easy enough.  Seriously folks, he didn't even do any other homework after his paper.  Albeit his paper was the main reason for doing homework though.  He played some more downstairs bball though.  Or DBB for short.  He can take anyone on in one on one DBB.  He'll go down there on anybody!!!  He ate some and then just looked outside and reveled in the majesty of the picturesque day.  It was such a fine day that he wished he wasn't couped up in his lovely abode doing work.  And not the Joules kind.  Well technically he was but not as in Physics homework.  But he is going to the Physics review night on Tuesday.  That should be learnable hopefully.  Learnation is fun when you really get to learnercise with your brain.  This is getting uninteresting quick.  Tyke is not happy that he has a lot of Photo stuff to do tomorrow though.  Cuz he really does.  Like 3 things he needs to do in class.  And then that other thing also.  And some other stuff too.  So that will suck and all.  And finals start on Wednesday.  People are all worrying and studying for them.  Tyke doesn't so much do that.  Not that type of guy really.  It's all cool though.  Some people just can't be as cool as Tyke.  And Tyke is really quite cool.  Not to toot his own horn and all but he is good.  He will toot his own horn right now but this toot goes out to Amed for whom skips over all the horn tooting that Tyke does in his blog.  So toot yourself a good one Amed.  And don't forget about predictability, or the paper boy, or even MTV!!!

      Ya know what guys, this is gayyy.  I always go on gay shows and do gay things.  I just try to be really real.  Hehe, anybody know who that alludes to?  And it is really a double allusion in itself.  Well only like 10 people max know what that is from first-hand experience.  And 2 more joined that group today.  But don't get ahead of ourselves hear.  Tyke's Sunday was like a sundae, an ice cream sundae that is!!!  OHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!  That was wicked clever.  But it was abnormal for the fact that since tomorrow is a holiday, pause for remembrance of MLK Jr., Tyke doesn't have to be in bed early or do homework or anything.  And it is good he didn't have to be in bed early cuz it is 1:04 right now so it is reaaaaaal late.  At 3 PM PST Tyke and Macaroon met up at Costco and they purchased a nice 18" pizza for approximately 11 dollas.  They took that ish back home and began their chow fest.  Amed had joined them by this point and he ate too.  Then Kinker and Tyronius came over as well.  They all ate the pizza and began to watch the good ol' fashioned pigskin game on the telly.  It was not a real close game and really the guys didn't care cuz they decided that Medal of Honor was way more fun.  So they played that and then after hours they were called by Dr. Phil Lelee and K-caj.  They all met at Teriyaki Bistro and had food there.  Then they went into Farget and just looked around and caused havoc like usual.  Upon leaving Tyke decided to use his quarter of change from dinner and he popped that baby into the slots.  Well, at least he pushed it into the slot for where you buy one of those kid toys things.  And guess what he got...A SILVER NECKLACE!!!  It is sick.  He is wearing it now and he is not going to take it off forever.  It will always be on him for the rest of his life.  Cuz of course his neck won't grow for the rest of his life so he will still be able to wear it.  How weird would it be if it didn't grow ever again?  Like, totally weird.  He is almost exactly 6' now.  He just measured himself today and it was nice to see he was 6' about a buck 30.  Yeah, thats reaaaal skinny.  Skin skinny really.  They all went back to Tyke's and played some more MOH...then they decided to try something new after the Trew-fanator got there.  They played some games in his downstairs such as H-O-R-S-E.  Tyke had the homecourt advantage and won both games.  The two games probably lasted about an hour total.  That is a long time by the way.  But Tyke made one of the best shots ever.  Here it was...Tyke went up to Tyronius and Trew-fanator who were on the couch together as usual and then his shot was that they had to go up to them, lift up your shirt and show your right nipple and then within 3 seconds you had to score a basket.  And ya know what?  K-caj didn't do it right.  He didn't show his actual nipple, rather he just lifted up one of his two shirts.  So that was a great shot.  Tyke had other good ones too, like one of his shots was "be white and make it."  Dr. Phil missed that one.  But Dr. Phil also really struggled with the game.  He could hardly even dunk it every time it seemed.  And the hoop is about 6'3" off the ground.  If that.  To make a long story short Tyke was hot...and not just in the physical sense but the physical sense too (second physical as in temperature-wise).  Then they wound down with a game of Ratscrew in which Dr. Phil gained revenge on Tyke's domination of H-O-R-S-E and beat him in the last round.  Then they played BS.  Tyke won fair and square, then came Macaroon, then Kinker, then it was down to the Doc and K.  It was a brutal matchup as they both just kept BSing the other of course.  Then Kinker had a brilliant idea and he came in the game to speed things up.  Then he got another brilliant idea and whenever K finally put down all his cards Kink put down the next set before Dr. could BS.  It was a striking decision that proved worthy of a championship.  Then they played Shithead and remarkably Tyke was the Shithead TWO TIMES IN A ROW!!!  Unbelievable.  The heads were not with him in that game.  He made up for it with his inane carrot sexuality.  You know who you are, Tyke's one and only horse.  He'll be the carrot in front of your face for life (patent pending on this analogy...no stealing of this can be done without the expressed written consent of Tyke Turner Enterprises).  Who ever thought that a young, athletic, witty, bright, blonde, Man-boy could ever be the ire of so many individuals?  As is the life of a Tyke.  Capital T Tyke not lowercase t tyke.  That would be like, "look at those little tykes over there playing naked in the sandbox...oh wait don't look.  they're naked.  that is indecent exposure...reeeeee errrrrr. reeeeeee errrrrr goes the siren as Police Officer Nasty comes in to arrest the indecently exposed tykes."  And that's the end of that.  Clap clap.  He repeats, clap clap.  And on that note...ENGLISH PAPER=SUCK.  EDIT:  English paper still=suck but Tyke realized he forgot something else from yesterday.  Two things actually.  First off, Tyke has learned that he greatly enjoys boxer briefs.  Much more than he thought he would.  Boxers still are very good and he still hates briefs but he is a fan of boxer briefs.  They provide a little support but are not tight or restriciting and so far they have never Trent Bunched on him.  And that is greatly appreciated.  They are super comfy.  And also, speaking of boxer briefs/underwear/not wearing any, last night upon rearrival from going out to dinner Kinker came down the back way to get into Tyke's house and he said he thought he heard/saw a bunch of skinny dippers in Lake Turner.  Well, maybe he didn't actually say that but somebody told Tyke that.  So they quickly went outside his house (it was dark at this point by the way) and Tyke brought a flashlight with him.  So they all went up on Tyke's deck and looked down into the lake.  Well they didn't actually see any skinny dippers but they saw a bunch of people.  So Tyke turned on the light and shone it down on them but they saw the kids just standing there and then one of the guys goes, "hey, somebody is shining a light on me."  Yeah, that was funny.  The people were probably smoking as the crew saw a bunch of little red lights sorta emanating from the group in question.  But they were clothed unfortunately.  And luckily they did not egg Tyke's crew's cars like has happened quite frequently around his house.  Well, maybe like 5 times.  But that is in a pretty short span.  And other vandalism has occurred to Tyke's house also.  Not his actual house but stuff with his garbage and just stupid shit like that.  Kids are stupid.  Reaaaaal stupid.

      Hey guys, this is the one and only Tyke Turner.  Tyke had a fun Saturday.  It was quite relaxed too and was really just a throwback to the olden days.  He got up late with the sun shining lightly into his room creating a faint tint to the green color encompassing his room.  But he was going to have just a lazy day and hopefully work on his english paper but he didn't get to.  Instead he decided to tag along with his mom when she went out to North Bend to do some shopping.  He hasn't done this in quite some time and it was actually somewhat fun.  He got some pants and a shirt and his mom said he needs to start looking for stuff for college next year (mainly wintry stuff cuz of the weather) and she recommended looking for coats.  So he decided that he liked one coat he saw enough to buy it.  He still needs to get another warm one but his mom is buying all this stuff so he really doesn't care.  He doesn't exactly like shopping but he loves getting new clothes.  At least, when they look good.  Tyke likes to be fashionable but really it isn't that big of a deal.  He wants to kind of be his own trendsetter but he really isn't at all.  He is just following some modern trends or even trying to be retro with something that was worn back in the day.  But clothes are still fun if they look good or funny.  Anyway, to be less boring Tyke will close that chapter of this blog and move on.  Tyke has a really good family friend that is going to New Zealand for a year to work and live so there was a party for him.  He is Tyke's brother's age and he has a sister that is Tyke's age.  They all went to the same preschool so they have really known each other for 17 years.  And the father is one of the weatherman at KING 5.  He was Tyke's connection to get his "job" at KING.  So that was really fun.  They reminisced about old times like when they would play with the "Navy Pink Bear" or play basketball with Bob Barker Kabuki or even play Jeopardy with players such as Mini-Chest and Mimi Bobek-occupation Drew hater.  Of course Tyke was the one with the innovation to make all of these names up.  He has been how he is now his whole life folks.  Believe you him.  He also saw a girl that he hasn't seen for years and they used to hang out together too.  And then another girl came over so it was Tyke and 3 girls.  Ya know, the use.  Don't worry, the girls have no interest in Tyke nor does he have any interest in them.  They have just been friends for a while.  Tyke is friends with a lot of girls in his life.  Pretty much all his life he has about as many girls as friends as guys.  But that is how he has wanted it so that is how it has been.  He still remembers when he got angry when someone was teasing him about one of his friends that was a girl and called her his girlfriend.  He came home and talked to his mom about it and realized that she was his girlfriend cuz she was a girl and a friend.  And that was the end of his anger.  It was much easier to get over things back then.  Pretty much just took something new to get his mind off anything.  And for some reason he just had a flashback to when he went out into his garage and since they had mice in the house there were mouse traps.  So one day he didn't see it and he stepped on it.  But oddly enough it didn't hurt.  So he was like, wow how does a mouse get killed by that ish?  But he was still young so he probably said it more like, "How do the mouth get died by the twap mommy?"  And she probably responded with, "Umm...well...er...Hey look Fer-Fer is outside."  Fer-fer was the deer that frequently visited the Turner house and Tyke named it after himself cuz he was so in love with deer.  Still is really.  But now it is just a fondness for the beauteous species.  Rather than an obsession.  His obsessions have matured from then if you know what he means.  Wink wink, etc.  Back to his night though, he came home and played a little bball downstairs.  Then watched Saturday Night Live.  Which is neither live nor televised solely on Saturday night.  So they are basically lying to the entire population with that title.  Eh, still Jessica Simpson was on it and she is just so damn fine that there is no way Tyke wouldn't watch it.  Sounds like Tyke has a certain type he likes for girls (not that this is all he looks for of course but as a pattern he has noticed this).  Blonde, buxom, sweet and innocent (if only seemingly).  BBSI.  Now ya know what that means.  Tyke actually is B, S, and I.  Not the second B of course though.  Unless you count his enlarged pectoralis major muscle.  But that is just cuz of his chest deformation and insane strength.  Tyke has quite a string of consecutive nights in which he has blogged.  Could be up to like 50 days now.  But probably less.  Anybody wanna count and let him know?

      Friday.  At what a fast pace you proceed.  With rather a reckless disregard for the safety of your occupants you hurtle through time.  Basically, once school ends you go by too quickly.  Today was a great day school-wise, for the most part.  Some stupid stuff happened but he doesn't actually remember what it was.  And some good stuff happened which is what he remembers more.  Regarding one bad moment he remembers, Purdy was not at school today which was unfortunate for she is a positive addition to the core.  However, Dotti and Haras were at school today so Tyke still had some lovely lady lovers to keep company.  Tyke, against Haras' wishes decided that he was going to go to the girls basketball game.  But Dotti, Purdy, Macaroon, and Amed were all supposed to go so that was a good reason for him and he doesn't really even get to talk to Haras much at bball games, unfortunately *sad face :(.  In 4th period Tyke texted Purdy but she didn't re-text.  So he actually listened a little to the presentations again.  And whats worse is that he is going to actually have to present on Monday, maybe Tuesday.  So that will mean he has to figure out some bullshit he can say for 5 minutes or so.  The rest of the day kinda dwindled to a pulp but 5th period saw Tyke start up Operation "I'm gonna flirt with you hot freshman girl that is in Purdy and Dotti's Link group and yet you won't even acknowledge that I am flirting."  Yeah, he had no luck with day one of the operation.  Now, he is not looking to be a "cradle robber" as one of Tyke's friends so eloquently put, but rather just finds it incredibly rewarding to "flirt" with girls that are much younger than him.  Kinda perverse in a way, but whatever, as is Tyke.  Tyke also walked by Skippy's 5th period class 4 times during class and then 2ice after class.  That was fun.  After school Tyke went home and shortly thereafter Amed, Kinker, Fejj, Tyronius, and Macaroon all made appearances, in that order.  They played some MOH and just pretty much only did that.  After they all left Tyke talked to Purdy online and they planned their night.  Purdy came over and picked up Tyke to go out on their "date."  Haha, it's funny to think that really the closest Tyke has to experience with a real date with a girl is going out to dinner with a girl who has a boyfriend with her driving.  But hey, there's nothing wrong with that.  It was just a nice din din between pals.  They were gonna go to Chili's but seeing as it was 6:30 on a Friday night and they couldn't find a close spot to park they went to Schlotzky's which was a great choice by Tyke.  All the while they had been listening to the styles of Tyke Turner's 1/23 CD aka Wide Array Ish.  Odd choice for a title and he has actually forgotten what he meant by that title so when he makes his version for Dotti-which will be on Saturday-he can make a better title.  Anyway, Purdy seemed to be pleased by the songs on there and that was a good omen for Tyke's future luck with giving his CDs out.  At dinner, they just talked about stuff and things and chewed the fat.  All the while picking out not only the same chips to eat but also the same drink!!!  WOW!!!  And Purdy said that if she were going to get a pizza she would have picked the same one that Tyke picked!!!  And Tyke wasn't even hungry!!!  HOW REMARKABLE!!!!  Almost as if they were meant to eat that dinner at Schlotzky's to show them that they had similar tastes.  Almost, but not quite.  After dinner they went to the girls game and watched that and talked to some old friends (sorta) and tried to find the Wicked Witch of the West.  Purdy thought that she saw her on the Sly Lion side but it was a different cheerleader as Tyke pointed out.  Anyway, the girls won and cheering was fun even though Purdy seemed to be really not feeling well and Dotti was sitting on the other side of Tyke so he couldn't talk to her.  But all was well at the end and the "date" closed out and then Tyke's second "date" of the night began.  Dotti drove Tyke over to Macaroon's work's sister's place where they met up with Karla, Mandy, Dudely, and the rest of a crew.  Good times right there.  They got in their cars and got ready to go.  They picked up Shy McPrettyCoolGuy at BCC and then went over to Jet City Improv for the nightcap.  It was a great show and Tyke totally got what he expected.  It was an awesome time and Tyke totally could see himself doing something similar to that in his future, were it not for his career as a newscaster.  Still though, he could probably have the talent enough to do it.  Quick thinking is key.  But anyway, after that Dotti tried to find the freeway but the rest of the car was no help to her really.  So she summoned her power of mapping and managed to get them back to the freeway and onto I-90 home.  They stopped at Shell and got some Sprees and Funyons...oh, and gas too.  Then they dropped off Shy McPrettyCoolGuy at his house/apartment/whatever that was and headed off to their cars.  Dotti then took Tyke home.  Tyke of course capped off the "date" with a kiss goodnight (lie) and wished his fair maiden a safe trip home (lie).  His "date" may have started with one beauty and ended with another but it was still his best "date" ever.  So thanks.  And goodnight.  Damn it feels good to be a Tyke-sta.

      Thursday is in the books.  This day came and went pretty quickly.  It was a bit of a surprise actually as Tyke was sorta fearing the day.  Not for any special reason other than just his having to go for a full day as he thoroughly enjoyed his Wednesday schedule as should every student in the WORLD!!!  Classes were pretty anti-social for the most part.  In english the teacher was keeping a watchful eye on the populace, keeping Tyke from venturing out into the world of Hangman, etc.  He actually payed (shiiiit, Tyke feels stupid for he doesn't know which version of paid/payed to use here...stupid Tyke, leave a comment to tell him what it is, oh wait he has it right now he thinks) attention in class.  He almost got involved with the conversation but he didn't want to have to stump Purdy with his super-hard question and make her look foolish in front of her peers so he just let it slide.  Don't forget that he was lying there.  Tyke isn't involved enough with any english work to actually think of a hard question.  So he just lied there to make friends.  Like he always does.  He lies a lot.  And is not joking when he says he's joking.  Well, sometimes.  When he says he hates Macaroon and that he is totally retarded he is joking.  When he just says that Macaroon is a dumbass, that is the truth.  But he still loves that kid.  Just joking (or was he?!?!?!?!  oh man that was a great setup!).  Tyke's lunch crew had two great events happen on their trip.  The first one was not a great event, but it was a discussion that will create great consequences.  Tyke, Dr. Phil, Amed, and Kinker all made a joint decision to set the time of departure on a normal school day for lunch at 11:40.  That gives 3 minutes to get out from class to Tyke's car.  Kinker does it with ease, so why can't Macaroon?  Well, he walks slow and has a really weird face when he is walking.  He slows up the entire procedure and could be the reason for Tyke's group not making it back to school with ease.  But the real event of lunch came after the crew left JIB.  At JIB they saw this Oldsmobile Silhouette have a hell of a time getting around.  It went through the drive-thru on two separate occasions and then when they left it was just sitting idled in a parking stall not doing anything.  Odd really.  But after that Tyke went to go take Newport Way (road parallel to Ted Meyer's) and what did he find?  Well a cop car was parked in the street with cones sitting out notifying the general public that the street was closed.  Oh and before Tyke forgets, this story was really poorly told to Purdy so she didn't find it interesting but it really was interesting.  She did do a great job of playing along though after Tyke made a big deal out of it.  She was a real trooper.  But anyway, Tyke was in the left turn lane and knew he had to get over.  Well, the first two bitches wouldn't let Tyke over so he cut over after that car and went straight through the light.  He then pulled off to the gravel shoulder and readied himself for one hell of a u-turn.  Amed, from the back seat, was heard to snidely remark that there was no chance of Tyke making the turn.  Actually he said something along the lines of Tyke needing to back the car up and wouldn't be able to just U it.  Man was he wrong as the vivacious and vigorous Volv made the turn with plenty of room to spare.  Tyke just flipped that bitch and rode it to new levels, of turning capacity.  He then got back on Gilman and drove for a little way dodging and weaving.  Oh yeah, another thing, Tyke was trying to beat the clock and get back before the first bell rang while doing this so there was a time crunch although really nobody had to be back on time.  But anyway, Tyke saw a red light appear.  He didn't panic, instead he coyly pulled into the Jay Berry's parking lot and paralleled the main road while going 30 in a very tight and narrow parking lot.  He found himself in a tight spot, literally, but maneuvered the Volv past a postal truck and kept on going.  He went through a stop sign and paralleled Front Street driving towards the school.  He saw an ambulance on his right as he attempted to get back onto Front and was fearful for a second that he would be in trouble with that sucka needing to get by.  But he didn't so he was clear.  But then this little whore of a girl and her mother needed to cross the goddamn street so he had to actually brake for them.  Then he was so incredibly amiable as to let this psycho cross the street too, even though he could have been committing an egregious error of trying to do so when seeing Tyke's Man-beast rumble down the trodden path at 40 mph right at his skinny little ass.  But Tyke let the fruit cross and continued his commando-style return from lunch.  Right by the library Tyke saw a 100 year old woman trying to back her wide ass up and get her tank onto the 2 lane road but Tyke would have nothing of it.  He sped up and swerved around her while still avoiding the other lane of traffic and maintaining perfect balance and civility inside the motor vehicle.  This meant that he could proceed through the fiery intersection and continue on his nearly completed journey back to school.  He pulled by the school and drove right through another stop sign while then hitting a perfect right turn and made his arrival at the school.  The car, and occupants, made it back to the hell hole with a few minutes before the second bell and Tyke and Macaroon made it to class with plenty of time thanks to the sagacious steering of Tyke Turner.  Oh yeah, and Macaroon wasn't wearing a seat belt.  So he could been pulled over for that.  Not to mention his at least 10 other illegal moves.  Driving is fun by the way.  And he gets to take the A-VA-LON tomorrow as Amed would say.  What a day it will be.  He even gets a free lunch at Pie cuz of his pie card being FULL!  Wow, Tyke is awesome.  You think you know, but you have no idea.  You think you have an idea, but you are in the wrong state.  You think you are in the right state but...damnit.

      Thursday is almost upon the west coast.  That means Wednesday has passed.  And nothing exciting at all happened.  School was pretty boring except it was short because of late start schedule meaning that Tyke didn't get that bored.  He went out to lunch in his normal car and he even, with Kinker, employed the Turner Move.  Parking Kinker's car down at the community center so as to assuage the crisis caused by the buses after school.  Then Tyke just drove Tyke to his car after school.  Worked like a charm.  A lucky charm.  With the leprechaun included.  As Tyke just wrote that he went and found a perfect new buddy icon.  Wow, that is so fitting.  He might be the one who finds it most hilarious but oh well, that means something good.  Good times in the Turner head.  Ahhh yes.  Go Tyke.  Well anyway, Physics was really funny again today.  Since 1/2 isn't there the two teachers have had no control over the class really.  So Tyke, Purdy, Kinker, and crew all just talk about stuff (mostly sex stuff today) and it is reaaaal funny.  Even when Tyke got repositioned by the teacher it was funny.  She said something funny to him, like it could have been taken that she was coming on to him or something, but really it was funny.  He also learned some new acts.  Like the jogger or going pole-skiing.  Ya know, just stuff like that.  But no Hot Carls or Cleveland Steemers.  Those are just gross.  Don't even ask.  WAY TOO SICK!  If you do ask what they are, then you are gross yourself and should be stabbed with a dull pen until a minor sore is created in your right armpit.  And then you should be kicked too.  Tyke has made up some odd punishments today.  Like his punishment for when his Word crashed on him.  It was quite random and odd, but fitting as Word did him a great disservice by closing on him.  If he could he would get back at Word.  But by swearing and throwing stuff at it, he would also be hurting other good programs, like Minesweeper and PowerPoint.  There ain't nothing wrong with those babies.  They don't deserve the punishment that Word should be put through.  He would love to give Word mad cow.  That would teach it.  Make it die a long and miserable death and then just go insanely crazy.  Now Tyke feels dirty for he is imagining different ways to murder a computer program that he uses frequently.  No matter.  After school Tyke came home and didn't do anything.  The highlight of his night might have been when he left the house to go to Kinko's and simply because it meant he could listen to his CD some more.  Oh crap, he forgot to make a copy for Dotti.  Sorry...he will do it tomorrow he hopes.  But that is a fun CD.  "If You Want My Body" is one of the greatest songs ever.  So catchy and Amed is in love with that one masculine yet feminine voice on it.  Odd description but very fitting at the same time.  Tyke has been taking a lot of vitamin C lately and that is actually kind of fun.  It gives him an odd rush when he has this one tablet.  Like his mouth kinda tingles and then his body sorta shakes and his sore throat even goes away at that point.  One of those things that can't be explained.  Kinda like this other situation he has been talking about with his mom.  As you all know, or at least should know, Tyke has this heart defect that he really has no idea what caused it or anything like that.  He also has a chest deformity but the doctors don't think that has any correlation to his heart (which is sorta odd but still).  Well Tyke has gone to his cardiologist and run tests and stuff but they haven't detected the problem so he just has to be wary of it.  But anyway Tyke talked to his mom today about how he felt, cold-wise, and he said something about his heart.  Well, immediately his mom started quizzing him about what it was he was feeling cuz now they know that his heart isn't exactly "normal" so they have to be cautious.  Well, it seems as though everything is normal but who knows.  Its not like Tyke is fearful of his heart condition or anything, more of just aware of possibilities and stuff.  And really, it is just a great story to tell if nothing does come of it.  He will be able to tell his grandchildren about how he lived the first 15 years of his life unaware that his heart and chest were abnormal monstrosities.  Of course he will add dramatic flair and take some storyteller's license.  He will be like Homer telling the Iliad and the Odyssey and that kind of jargon.  To go off on another tangent (cuz really that is all this is, tangents and rambles, rambles and tangents) Tyke is a touchy person.  As Haras knows, Tyke likes to receive that unexpected blindsided hug and it really makes his day.  A hug really can show someone you care.  Or it can just show that you are horny.  Sometimes it is hard to differentiate between the two.  Not that Haras was horny when she hugged Tyke.  He isn't saying that.  He's sure she wasn't.  Not that there's anything wrong with being horny.  But she was just being friendly.  Friendly is good.  Eek, bad ending to the blog.  Damn, Thursday sucks.

      Hi to all you Tykesters.  Don't you know that you're toxic?  Oh wait, that is a song.  Oh wait, that was gay...Today wasn't gay though.  1st period wasn't too bad.  Kinda interesting.  Tyke made it fun at least.  Then he walked with Tina and chatted to Amyazing for about a second before heading off to weight training.  That class was boring as hell.  It was lock day.  So Tyke got his lock and then sat on the bench in there for about 35 minutes.  Maybe more.  It was hell.  Better than dying though.  Tyke really had a pretty boring 3rd period.  4th period wasn't too bad.  Then came lunch.  Yep, lunch in the van.  That was sick.  They went out to Subway.  A full van.  Dr Phil riding shotty, Amed and Kinker in the mid, and Macaroon, etc in the back.  A full van indeed.  But it was fun.  The only problem with the van is the cd player but Tyke has actually found out how to make it work.  So that is good for future reference.  The rest of the day kinda wound down and dissipated out.  Well, not so much physics where they had some very interesting conversations.  In english Purdy wrote a very dirty haiku (dirtier than Tyke's even) and that pretty much summed up what was talked about in physics.  Not the haiku but that topic.  But really, what's more fun to talk about than sex?  Nothing.  Plain and simple.  Nobody can truthfully say otherwise (probably a pretty big lie but still Tyke can say it cuz he is the author).  So anyway after school Tyke and Purdy talked some more about the always-pertinent topic of standing with your significant other when they put their arm around you but not over your shoulder, rather on your hip.  Purdy thinks it is weird to have that happen.  More of just, what is she supposed to do?  Tyke's first suggestion was to just roll it into a hug.  Not a bad idea at first he thought but now it is less of a plausible idea.  But after school Tyke, Purdy, Tina, and Tig'Ol all tried some new ways to handle the situation.  And also the hand on the far hip while walking situation.  Where the girl doesn't know what to do with her hand.  Well, as Tyke has learned from watching Newlyweds, Jessica Simpson just puts her hand on Nick like he does to her.  So that seems to work well.  Maybe that too is implausible but there has to be an answer to that problem.  Someday it will be discovered.  And when it is Tyke will be happy.  Until then he will be wondering.  Not really though cuz he will be wondering more about another subject.  His next subject of discussion in fact.  And that would be relationships.  A highly discussed topic but always relevant in this day and age.  Well, here is what Tyke is going to talk about.  Actually, he is just going to ramble.  Tyke doesn't get why relationships have to be so hard.  Sure, nobody really understands that but Tyke really questions it.  Like why do people have to be so stupid about things.  If the majority of this world would just think before acting and not say one thing and do another then there would be far fewer problems.  And lying doesn't protect feelings.  Lying is found out easily and then it creates just a magnitude of problems.  Rather than lie about something just come out and if it is something that could potentially cause strife in the relationship then discuss it with your partner.  That takes more guts anyway.  And it should, at least if your partner is not a prick, show that you care about them and are looking to keep things steady and happy.  Mainly, be cognizent of your partner's feelings because if you aren't then there are just too many opportunities for difficulties down the road.  And also, Tyke thinks that being forward is also important (at least to him, a lot of people might not agree).  Keep things up front and then it won't seem like you are hiding anything.  But really, if you just don't let stupid, passing feelings get in the way of what you feel for your partner then you will be fine.  It helps to know what your partner (Tyke doesn't like using partner but he knows no other word he wants to use) thinks and feels as well.  Such as if they are a person that can be somewhat prone to getting kind of jealous then know that and make sure that you don't do anything that is too flirty.  Now if the person is getting jealous over nothing, then that is a different story and then the problem falls upon him/her.  Don't get jealous yourself.  Tyke has used a lot of "don't"s so here is a do.  Do be loving and cherish the moments you have.  Cuz they will be fleeting moments in not too long.  For most, you will not be with your other for much longer so these are the times that you should be holding onto.  Don't let chances pass you by.  Take what you can get.  Believe Tyke, you will be kicking yourself if you miss opportunities.  And that is one of the worst feelings in the world, you know what the worst is...haha.  To quote a great poem, don't let opportunities pass you by for you may "catch yourself yawning" should you do so.  All this advice is really pretty straightforward and Tyke really didn't need to say any of it because it should be common knowledge but it isn't to a lot of people.  And if you are taking advice you must be messed up.  Cuz look at how well his advice has helped him out!  Haha, just kidding cuz any advice is good advice as long as it is heeded with a clear mind.  No matter the donater of advice.  Oh, and by the way Tyke IS single.  Just so you know...

      Another day has passed of Tyke's high school life.  And another boring day has passed in Tyke's social life.  Today started out awesome cuz Tyke listened to his new mix and parked in his new spot.  Then he had to get out a minute early to go get his new schedule which kinda sucks but not really.  It is just different.  He doesn't have any new girls in his class unfortunately.  It is always fun to make a fresh start with a girl that doesn't exactly know you that well but kinda knows who you are.  The problem is that only happens with girls that aren't in his grade.  Like Shawna for instance would be an example.  But it is still fun.  Basically Tyke likes to flirt with girls that are younger than him but are hot.  Sounds kinda perverted but what guy doesn't want to?  Tyke just has the balls to do it you could say.  Tyke's 4th period is now awesome.  Not only has Amed joined the fray but mAnus has left and they switched seats.  Tyke now sits as far away from the teacher as possible.  He sits with Amed, Dr. Phil, Dotti, Purdy, and Beaner now.  A marked improvement over his last spot.  Tyke has now written a couple more haikus...pretty much the same as his last ones with one of them being a little more explicit.  But they are still pretty fun to write.  He loves letting his imaginative side run wild as you may have noticed.  Seldom is he more pleased than when he has written something really funny or deep or just something really entertaining.  Well here is a new topic of conversation.  The Sly Lion game on Friday.  Girls are at home and boys are at Sly Lion.  Now Tyke has people from both sides telling him to go to their game.  This is a tough choice.  On one side there are all of the stupid people who go to the boys games and would think Tyke's cheers stupid so they wouldn't get pumped up.  On the other hand the girls don't need the support as much as the boys cuz they are a better team.  Tyke does want to rent an eagle suit or something like that as that would be hella tight.  He knows he won't but still it would be awesome.  He is just looking forward to that game and all of the responsibility that comes with it (which is really none since it is Tyke and he doesn't have any responsibility to the team).  But Tyke's cheering is heard loud and clear.  Make no mistake about that.  He is one hell of a cheerer.  Damn, this sucks...for the last like week Tyke hasn't had anything good to talk about in his blog other than his daily recounts.  And that bothers him.  He wants to talk about feelings again cuz he misses that.  Some people might have hated those days but Tyke felt better after talking about stuff.  However, he has decided to actually keep some of his life private.  Which is probably for the better.  Now, no need to ask what he is keeping private because he won't tell you.  But just know that it is private.  Anyway, this is a really short blog cuz it is pointless to ramble on.  Nobody would be interested in anymore jumbled phrases and garbled words.  So go off to bed and sleep like Tyke will be doing soon.  To sleep off this sickness he is feeling come on.  But should you want, "If you want my body...and you think I'm sexy..."  Leave the rest to your imagination ladies and gentleman.  You know what Tyke's talking about.

      Sunday is a day that has a weird feeling to it and Tyke has never been able to shake that feeling in his life.  He had some semi-traumatic experiences on Sunday growing up which is why he doesn't like Sundays.  Traumatic might not be the right word to use as it wasn't like he was facing danger or anything.  Just some bad experiences.  That is in the past but still there are remnants.  He brings this up just for a small detail he will discuss later.  But to start it out Tyke woke up on Sunday and then heard the vibration (yeah, he heard not felt the vibe) of his cell thanks to Dotti's text.  It was about Refuge tonight and Tyke planned on going-more about that later.  Tyke went to Macaroon's house in the afternoon with Amed and they planned on going to Pike Place and making a video.  Well, that didn't assimilate but they still went to Crossroads (kinda an odd choice but still fun).  They went to Circuit City, Sports Authority, and then walked around the food court to buy lunch.  After that they went to Bartell's for some candy.  Cuz who doesn't go to Bartell's for candy, guys?  Really...be serious.  Bartell's is awesome.  On Tyke's post right now he has just noticed that the three Bartell's he typed previously are all perfectly lined up on the left of the screen.  They won't be when you read them though.  After Bartell's they went back to Macaroon's place for some bball loving.  Tyke played pretty well and won a game of 21.  They played an odd version of the game and they need to just finally decide on one set of rules and use those all the time so there aren't arguments.  After that Tyke retired to his abode and just hung out with his parents for a little.  His dad was sick earlier and now his mom got what he had so Tyke is hoping that he doesn't succumb to the power of the common cold.  He will fortify his defenses though with the superhuman strength of 1000 mg doses of the wonder drug Vitamin C.  That usually does the trick. Tyke hasn't gotten sick much since freshman year.  He got sick a lot that year though.  Stupid dirty school.  Made him all icky sicky.  So after that he worked on his new mix which has a wide range of taste.  From Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson to G-Unit and Twista featuring Kanye West and Jamie Foxx.  From Beyonce to Cassidy featuring R Kelly.  It is a hit though with Tyke...not that that is a surprise since he made the cd.  Well now he is listening to Everything by Fefe Dobson.  Yeah, now this is a girly song.  And it is awesome!!  NOSome really.  If Tyke hasn't told you what that means it is this: awesome with a kick of N.O.S. to make it more powerful.  He just coined that a week or two ago.  Kinda gay but he is a coiner.  Nonetheless he uses it cuz he made it up.  Tyke then realized after making the cd that it was 8 and he had forgotten about Refuge.  So yet again, he didn't make it.  But that was ok with Dotti, she just didn't want him to be sitting there alone which is why she re-texted him.  Awww...how nice of her.  Tyke would like to talk about Purdy and Haras and the rest of his friends that love to see their names mentioned in the blog but in order to have that happen Tyke really needs something to talk about.  Sometimes Tyke takes care of that himself by having flashbacks to moments in the past but not all the time.  He would like to have a flashforward though to like 8 years in the future.  He wants to see who he is dating.  Cuz that is really all that is important to him in the future.  What girl he likes.  Obsessed?  Yep.  But he can't do much about that.  Other than not talk about it on a website where anyone could see it.  But whatcha gonna do?  Come on.  Tyke just wants someone.  Hey guys, remember these types of blogs from Tyke?  Those were the days.  The lonely days.  Even though at the moment of writing this he and Dr. Phil Lelee are talking about dying young and single and people who die single period.  Not that it will happen to Tyke but still...kinda weird to think about.  Tyke also has now had quite a long streak of blogging about his days events.  Since November he believes.  He went through them yesterday trying to figure it out but he realized he couldn't without reading a little of the blog because some of the days he blogged on a Sunday about Saturday and on Saturday he didn't blog at all.  But that still counts as blogging for the day.  And this counts as blogging for the day as well.

      Hello.  How are you?  Oh, how come?  Well, Tyke will tell you how he is now.  What's going on with Saturdays folks?  They used to be so fun.  So action-packed.  So exciting and innovative.  Now what are they?  Days spent home hanging out with the parents.  And Tyke is getting used to it.  Not that his parents are bad but he doesn't want to be spending his weekends sitting at home watching old movies and listening to old music.  But that is what he has been doing.  Today was not what he was hoping for.  He woke up about 11.  Which was cool.  Then he got his haircut a little later.  He played some 4-player Halo by himself (fun for a while actually).  Kinda sad though when you are pretending that there are other people playing with you when really it is just you downstairs by yourself talking to the couch and the love seat.  At around 3 PM he went outside to get the mail.  Well he ended up just standing out there waiting for the mail truck to come.  But he did have a reason to be waiting for the mail.  Since grades got sent out, he needed to pilfer the mail and keep it for himself.  Kind of an underhanded move right there and it could prove to be the wrong move later on but for now it worked.  So he took the grades and now has them in his room.  Oh yeah, his grades are horrible if you were wondering why he did this.  2.817 just to let you know.  Yeah, Tyke had a bit of an off semester.  Well really he just didn't work at all.  It won't affect college though.  The beauty of his school being an easy school is evident here.  Later on he watched some TV and played some games and shuffled cards a lot.  He played a game of Solitaire and only minorly cheated to win.  He likes to just flip 1 card at a time sometimes.  The fun for him is winning.  Not playing.  So that was that part of the night.  For dinner he had some chicken that had like mushroom sauce on it and some Mexican rice.  The rice was good.  Tasted a lot like some good enchiladas.  All in all, it was good.  After dinner he putzed around downstairs and played some basketball by himself.  He fake play-by-played the game he was playing.  He has grown up doing that so it isn't like it is something new for him.  Just something that kept him entertained in Preston.  He did it for all sports he played in his old house.  Baseball (with miniature bats and yarn balls), basketball, soccer, ping pong.  Not so much ping pong but he played.  A little later he decided to watch a movie by himself (notice how he is including "by himself" everytime to try and emphasize the fact?).  He realized he still hadn't seen Catche Me if You Can so he popped that in and watched it.  He actually thought it was pretty good.  During the movie he texted Dotti and that was pretty much the highlight of the night seeing as that was the most interaction he got with a non-family member all day.  Tyke is really confused now.  He isn't even sure what he is trying to figure out but he just can't comprehend anything with his brain now.  But listening to The Beatles is helping.  Tyke doesn't know how anybody can hate all of The Beatles songs.  He doesn't actually know anybody who does but there shouldn't be a person anyway.  Again, Tyke is confused.  For English he thinks the song he is going to analyze will be Nobody Knows it But Me by Babyface.  Or a song like that.  Not something funny so much as sappy.  Tyke can make that easier than making something funny.  Being funny is hard.  Being romantic is easy.  Writing papers is hard.  Writing poems is easy.  Or at least in Tyke's case this is true.  He actually might go write some poetry now.  Some good stuff.  Well, let's all hope for Tyke's sake that next Saturday is going to be a day packed full of fun events.  Cuz this one wasn't.  That is why he is blogging before 11PM.  BLEH!

      Today was an interesting day.  It started out how Thursday night had been going.  Sleepy and just out of it, emotionally and physically.  The first 3 periods were pretty much like that.  He kinda snapped out of it in 4th period while listening to some music.  Then he went out to lunch with Dr. Phil and Amed and ditched Macaroon and Kinker pretty much.  It was ok though cuz they went out together.  But Tyke went to Costco and got such a good ice cream bar.  Those things are so damn good.  Tyke could eat one.  And then another.  Mmmm...ice cream.  After that Tyke came back to lunch to take the data match thingy but he didn't have time so he failed at doing that.  Then he went to Graphics and helped Macaroon make his new logo for the school.  It turned out pretty sick.  Like good enough to be put on uniforms and shit.  Tyke really does like it.  After that they had a pretty easy Physics quiz and such.  Good times began after that.  Tyke and Macaroon took on Kinker and Purdy (in that order) in bball at the comm cent.  It was an historic battle between the two colossal giants, Tyke and Kinker, and the two speedy shooters, Purdy and Macaroon.  Coming into the contest, Tyke was picking Kinker to win.  However, Tyke was playing quite well in the game.  He blocked Kinker once and kinda blocked another but was playing very good disruptive D to start it out.  Kinker got a little frustrated but that didn't stop the FORCE from scoring.  Tyke did what he could and managed to play pretty stringent defense while working pretty well on the offensive side too.  He couldn't hit one of his two 2's though when he really needed to so they ended up losing 11-8.  But it was a close battle.  Tyke had 6 and Macaroon 2.  Macaroon's shots just weren't falling and Tyke had no trouble with that.  But he did get schooled by Purdy once and she kinda dominated him a couple times.  All in all, Macaroon coulda stepped it up more.  Purdy played pretty well for totally being out of her element.  Playing on the carpet, with the brace, and with a men's ball.  She was a troubador...no...trooper out there and showcased her talent with an amazing lay-in that somehow went in.  Tyke was getting ready to swat it out of the court but she threw it up so awkwardly he had no chance.  And it somehow went in.  So all in all, Tyke was MVP of his team and Kinker of his.  But it was a great battle and hopefully there will be more in the future.  But maybe Tyke will be able to dunk by then.  He really thinks he will be able to dunk sometime in his life on a full size hoop with no added help.  If he grows 2 more inches and doesn't lose his vertical jump then he will definitely be able to dunk.  If he gets another 2 inches on his vert he thinks he can dunk.  All this could be wrong but he was kinda close today.  The rim rejected the ball.  But that is still pretty good for a 5'11" 130 pound white guy.  Although weight has nothing to do with it as it is easier to be lighter.  Purdy ended up going home to eradicate some problems but the guys stuck around.  They played 21, bounce 21, HORSE, and just a bunch of fun games.  It was really fun and Tyke was feeling good.  After that Tyke came home and ate a sub sandwich and drank some A&W Cream Soda.  Then he sat on his couch in his boxers and shorts for a long time as it was really comfortable.  And he was tired.  Then he showered and ate pizza and Macaroon and Amed came over.  They watched some games and stuff and then went to the girls bball game.  Tyke drove the A-VA-LON and whoo that was great.  At the game Tyke sat next to Frederique.  Tyke had made a double-sided sign.  One side for Tina, and one for Haras.  Haras was pleased by the sign even though it was not much.  But it's the thought that counts and Tyke literally spent 15 minutes trying to think of a subject for his sign.  But she smiled when she saw it and that is all Tyke needed.  Tina saw her sign too but Frederique was holding it for most of the time.  The game was fun.  More good times.  Afterwards the crew, Tyke, Kinker, Macaroon, and Amed all went over to Farget.  Tyke blew past Racer on the freeway.  She was going about 60 in the Subaru while Tyke easily cruised past 90 (and it was cruising not speeding as you don't feel a thing in the A-VA-LON).  The cool guys got some cool drinks and then they used the Self-Scan machine which is always a treat.  Especially when you only have one item.  Then they went back to Tyke's house and he owned the street.  He managed to forget to turn on his lights he thinks but he still past Kinker and Amed in one fell swoop and just dashed by them.  Amed's reaction to that was great.  Tyke doesn't remember what it was but it was great.  The guys got home and played some Halo.  Then DOTTI CAME OVER!!!!  And she knew how to get to his house too!!!!  Now that is wicked cool!!!  A great addition to the crew on this night.  They all played a few rounds of Chinko when she got there and she caught on quick.  This game is gonna catch soon.   The whole school is gonna be hooked before the year is over.  Just wait...JUST WAIT!!!  Dotti seemed to enjoy it, if only minorly.  Then the video time came.  Since Dotti hadn't seen any videos, Tyke showed em all.  The Amazed one got the usual response.  Freaked.  She couldn't seem to believe that Tyke showed the video to Tina.  Yeah, it's a little...hmmm, odd.  But still a well-done video.  All of the videos were semi-good so they decided to make another edition of Talking Sex with Dema "The Russian" Shevelenko.  This one revisited the PACO shirt so it was good.  They had some pretty good calls Tyke thinks so it should be alright.  It was about 20 minutes long probably.  Good times.  Dotti left in the middle of the video so they said their teary-eyed goodbyes but then quickly resumed videotaping upon her departure.  They finished it out and it is done.  Then they played some more Halo.  Then they all retired to their homes.  Good times.  And then Tyke blogged.  Tomorrow Tyke gets a "nice ass" and will probably hang out doing the use.  Not that much homework this weekend so that's good.  More time for the ladies...oh wait, more time for the guyssss...Damn.

      Awwww.  Thursday.  You're so kute.  And today was kinda kute.  School is all that Tyke has to talk about really today so he will have to suffice with that.  In math he got on the subject of world records with Commander Cool.  They talked about his bowling experience that he and Kinker "plan on doing."  Fat chance of that.  But in this day and age you can never know.  Who knows...maybe a bowling alley will sponsor their 3-day bowl-a-thon.  2nd period was pretty bland.  Haha, get it?  It was a pun.  Tyke likes being all tough and stuff in Weight Training.  There are so many underclassmen that he looks old and strong.  Even though he really isn't.  At least upper body.  Lower body he can hold his own but not upper body.  But since he knows all of the lifts and such he can teach everyone in the class and since NOBODY seems to know how to do dots or power cleans he looks like a total stud being good at those.  Even though he really isn't good at power cleans.  3rd period would have been hella boring if Tyke and Purdy didn't write to each other would you rathers and such.  Tyke asked a Would You Rather about who would you rather make out with: Jessica Simpson or Britney Spears.  And so far 100% of the answers have been Britney Spears.  One of the answers was foolish: "I can't make out with someone who is stupid."  Come on!  Sure ya can!!!  And who says Britney isn't stupid???  Anyway, this is boring to write for Tyke.  So it must have been a boring day.  4th period was alright.  Tyke said some stuff that was funny.  No biggies though.  Just the use.  After 4th period Tyke went out to lunch with Purdy and Kinker to Front Street.  Macaroon was unexpectedly left out in the cold however.  Tyke will take the hit on that one but it wasn't totally his fault.  It's all good in the end.  5th period was long and boring.  6th period was ok.  After school was boring cuz he went home and did nothing.  Watched some Full House of course but that was pretty much it.  Played some bball downstairs but really that was all.  Then he...nope, that actually was it.  Oooo, Amazed just started playing.  Now there is a great song.  It was in the True Life episode that Tyke saw a brief glimpse of while channel surfing tonight.  It was about 4 youths in wheelchairs and their daily life.  The song was played at this handicapped guy's prom.  And he was singing along.  Yeah, well Tyke right now has something he really wants to talk about but won't.  He wants to talk about it so bad that he is writing this.  It is weird.  Tyke is such a personable person that he always is wanting to talk about his feelings and such but just he doesn't feel like he should tell anyone about this.  It is really odd.  This is just something that he...grrrrrr.  Enough.  Stop.  This blog is going nowhere.  Tyke has had a boring night.  He has loved having no homework but he lied when he said it was relaxing.  It was just boring.  He wanted to do stuff.  Tyke really hates being couped up in the house.  He needs to go out or have people come over.  Double grrr...anyway, this blog has hardly been worthy of a post so let's just let Tyke cut his losses and be done with it.  Goodbye.  Ya know what sucks though...Dotti wasn't in class :(  That is saddening.  Oh yeah, and maybe Tyke feels kinda *bleh* cuz he is really sleepy.  He did fall asleep while watching TV tonight so that could be.  Hopefully...

      Yep, Wednesdays rule.  Nobody can deny that.  They are that little spark in the week that keep the populace coming.  Tyke really needs that little perking up in the middle of the week.  And today did that for him.  Classes were short and sweet.  Semi-sweet.  Kinda bittersweet at times, like the chocolate.  The majority of his time was spent talking as usual so he stayed somewhat entertained.  And Mrs. Dyke-Bitch pretty much told everyone that she was a skanky-ho and that when she went to college she "found boys."  But you all know what that means.  Ewwww by the way.  If you don't know who she is then you are lucky cuz after knowing her you would not want to think this way about her.  And Tyke really hates that he is thinking about it now but he has to so as to please the crowd.  Also in english he let Purdy have another one of his mixes he made in the past.  It's fun to have other people tell him they like the songs he puts on mixes.  So now he is going to make another version for Dotti as he is sure that she will want it too.  And Purdy wants him to put all his good songs on her MP3 player sometime so he will.  Music is a huge part of his life.  He is always listening to music and it really amplifies his moods.  It can also sway his moods but he doesn't do that to himself anymore.  He only listens to music that provides the same mood as what he is feeling at that time.  If that makes any sense.  If it doesn't then just disregard.  Right now Tyke is watching the Real World.  He hasn't ever really liked the show but he still watches it.  It is kind of interesting but in a weird way.  He really doesn't like mean people.  So he always likes watching the nice people on shows like this.  Cuz he sympathizes with them.  After school today Tyke went over to Macaroon's with Fejj and later Amed.  They played some hoops to start out with and that was fun.  Except for one part.  Which was funny but not fun for Tyke.  He had been getting great vertical on his leaps and was getting his entire hand easily into the hoop so he thought maybe he could dunk.  So he took the ball and started to go and jumped off of one foot but at the same time he sorta slipped with his other foot.  So he jumped and fell all at the same time.  It seemed like it was slow motion and he thought he had an easy opportunity to correct himself and land without hurting himself but that sure as hell didn't happen.  He fell on his left elbow (one with screw in it), left hip (not the one that got hit with the ball bearing), and his hands.  All hurt but it wasn't too bad.  More of an hilarious stunt that should have been videotaped.  It would be a classic.  Oh yeah, he missed the dunk...The crew went inside Macaroon's and hung out for a while.  Then Skippy came over and they decided to play some more bball.  It was fun.  Tyke is feeling good about his matchup on Friday.  He thinks he can really have his game escalate to the level he needs to win.  They probably will lose but whatever.  It will be a grand ole time.  Tyke is now really hoping that at some time he will be able to dunk.  He is pretty close he thinks.  The big problem is that even if he can jump high enough he doesn't really have big enough hands to dunk most balls.  So it would be a two hand slam.  And it would be weak.  Whatever though.  Tonight was another lax night for Tyke.  Since there were no events going on he stayed home and just chilled.  He'll prolly do his only homework, math, during the OC so that is good.  And Tyke got an urge to vacuum today too.  He vacuumed the downstairs and even his bathroom.  That is much easier than sweeping.  Try it sometime.  But since Tyke's house is the party house he wants to keep it somewhat clean.  Especially when he has lady friends over...whenever that may be.  He has people over to his house pretty much every weekend.  Like almost literally every weekend people come over to his house.  It has never been much of a problem and he has liked it but lately he wants to do something else.  Or at least have new people over.  The guys just are playing video games together all the time and then occasionally some Chinko.  Tyke wants to play some board games he just realized.  Yeahhh...board games.  Real fun times.  Maybe he will do that after the girls game Friday.  Some board games and Chinko and videotape watching/making.  If not watching, then making.  Nonetheless Tyke decided that Friday nights are the best nights of the week.  Saturday nights aren't as good cuz the next day is Sunday and people are busier on Saturdays than Fridays in many cases.  So...thats about it.  Hope you likey.  Byey.  Fer Fer is out.  And so is Tyke.

      Don't worry, the streak lives on for yet another day.  And it should live on for at least...well, a long time.  Barring any serious typing injury or dismemberment or a total lack of an audience.  That would suck.  Not that it will happen but that would totally defeat the purpose of his blog really.  Cuz without it he would just be telling things to nobody and just reading it himself and commenting on it with different fake names to try and make himself feel better.  And no, he doesn't do that now.  The only time he posts a comment is when he uses the name Tyke.  So don't think that he is making all of those comments.  Not that they are anything important anyway.  Well hey, this is a good sign.  Tyke has already rambled for a good little bit and has racked up some nice volume to this cylindrical spherical cube.  Today started off nicely.  Oh wait, it didn't actually.  He had a stupid 1st period.  His teacher is stupid.  She really is being stupid.  This semester she has tried to teach and enforce rules.  Like, who the hell cares biatch???  Come on, shut the hell up.  Nobody likes you.  Go back to fuckin Denmark.  Go ride a windmill while your there and then maybe you will get crabs or something and then have to live in a cardboard box for the remainder of your pitiless existence of a life.  Eh, the rest of the day progressed alright.  English entailed the denoument of the Sula presentation.  Just answering some questions and Tyke did fine with that.  Mainly cuz he never got asked a question directly so he just got to add tidbits of sensical nonsense.  It was just some good old mumbo jumbo.  Went to Mickie D's today.  Another free lunch thanks to the gift certificates he got there in his stocking over Christmas.  Kind of an odd gift but really, quite valuable.  He loves knowing that he can have a free lunch one day a week if he wants.  That is a great feeling cuz he never wants to make a lunch so he just doesn't.  Even though he can make a mean bagel with cream cheese.  Mmmm...bagel.  Mmmm...monkey.  Mmmm...pistol whip.  Well anyway, thats cool.  So how bout those things?  Doin good?  Nice.  Yep.  Not too bad.  Not sure what this is supposed to be but the possibilities are limited.  Not limitless.  Limited.  After school Tyke returned home to his abode again, just to sit around for nothing.  He watched a nice little double package of Full House though.  The ones where Jesse and Becky get married.  And Michelle, she's so cute :), is being all cutesie and such.  It's really a classic dual episode.  And then the song that Jesse sings as his vows is really good.  Sorta.  It's good.  But it is so fake with his voice and Becky's too.  He loves looking at the show now and seeing all the insane stuff that happens in the show and how he didn't think anything of it when he watched the show as a little kid.  Like what family kisses and hugs this much???  Yeesh, they are like a newlywed couple but related.  It's kinda gross.  Especially seeing Danny always kissing Michelle.  How gross would that be now??  Some like 55 year old geezer (eww my dad's that old) kissing this really hot 18 (almost...) year old on the forehead and blowing on her tummy.  That would be gross.  It would be gross for Tyke to do it even.  But oh would he love it.  Speaking of love it Tyke talked with Tina at the basketball game tonight.  Oh man...he just couldn't pass up that transition.  Don't worry, his feelings have truly dissipated considerably.  Sorta.  But enough of that.  He is going to start censoring his thoughts somewhat on this blog.  However, online and in person he is free to talk about anything.  Oh yeahhhhh.  Sorry, he is just blabbering on now.  But the game was fun.  Guys got hosed but still fun.  Talking with the crew.  Getting a little rub down from Dotti (wink wink nudge nudge tickle tickle).  That had to be resurrected sometime.  The tickle tickle that is.  Can't be overused though.  So stop.  No more.  Tyke is really looking forward to playing some bball again.  He hasn't really played since the game against the Sly Lioners.  And that was fun.  That was a great time really.  It was really cool how Haras and Purdy came and cheered them on while filming.  He wants to have a little get together with them to watch the tape and hang out sometime.  Hey, Tyke's free on Friday.  Wink wink.  Yeah, he's always free.  Go him!!!  They probably won't be but ya never know these days.  If you know what he means.  Do you?  That would be weird if you did.  Cuz he had no meaning.  Ok, seriously.  Stop.  This is just weird.  So...  Umm...bye.  WEDNESDAY!!!!!

      Today wasn't as bad as expected.  It sucked royally but all in all he did alright.  His speech went by alright.  he somehow bullshitted for like at least 7 minutes and still could have said more stuff but he didn't need to.  Tomorrow he just needs to answer some questions and such.  But that should be pretty easy cuz they are on a time limit.  And time limits are Tyke's friend.  In most cases.  Except when it is like somebody saying, "You have one minute to hang out with me" or "You have 2 hours where I will be free to hang out with you so make it fun."  That is so hard to do.  Tyke can't just make up things to do.  Although the game of Chinko can definitely be an insanely fun game.  They keep adding amendments to the Chinko Constitution though so as to make the game better and better.  Tyke got a Derek on his physics final and a Chris in the class but thats ok.  He will get a horrible GPA so he might as well have 3 terrible grades.  If you're gonna fuck up, might as well do it in a bunch of classes at once!  That way you get everything out of the way at once.  Rather than spacing out the pain and drama.  Wow, not much to talk about in today's blog.  Don't worry, he is still going to write the normal amount but he just doesn't know what he is going to write about yet as often he has some idea of what he can say.  Kinda like a preliminary little plan in his head of what to say.  An outline would be the "technical term" for what it is.  Really, it is just him mapping out ideas in his mind.  No wonder they call them mind-maps.  Wow, who knew???  There is one subject Tyke could spend some time talking about but he won't.  It is stupid.  And trivial.  Its just that Purdy made a bit of a deal out of it so Tyke had to stay strong and not lie.  And he didn't lie.  He isn't lying.  Truly.  He swears on anything you want him to swear on.  Since he doesn't believe in that shit he can swear on anything.  He'll swear on anybody's life.  His own, his parents', his brother's, anyone.  Just ask him to tomorrow and he'll do it.  But basically, his point in bringing up this subject is that he wants everyone to know that he doesn't lie about things like this.  He lies pretty frequently, yes.  But for other things.  Like to cover his ass, or to make himself not look like an idiot in front of a lot of people who would just incessantly ridicule him.  And it isn't to avoid the embarassment of the ridicule so much as the annoyance of taking the time out to ridicule him rather than talk about something fun.  BUT, he doesn't lie about things like this.  He may lie at first but if keeps insisting he isn't lying then he isn't.  His lies are concise and consist of great brevity so as to enhance the believability.  Tyke has basically revealed a bunch of secrets about him in the blog for the pure reason of entertainment and that he had nothing else to talk about.  But so far that hasn't created a problem so it doesn't matter.  In the future, things could change.  But you know what, Tyke has been thinking about college some.  Not just college but his blog in college.  He hopes that he keeps doing it then.  And also he hopes he can do it while he is in Europe this summer.  It will only be 2 weeks but that is a long time not to see anyone he wants to see.  And he is not looking forward to summer in a way.  Just cuz he never has gotten to see the people that he wants to see.  Or at least not often.  Like Tina for instance.  Or Purdy and Dotti last year.  Not until one of the last days did he hang out with Purdy.  And Dotti didn't even get to participate in the festivities so it wasn't as cool as it could have been.  Tyke loves how Dotti loves how Tyke smells.  Nothing like that feeling.  Mainly cuz it is just a unique feeling.  But it feels good.  If only every girl felt that way.  But then the uniquity (coined form of unique) of the feeling wouldn't be there and it would be less pleasing.  He has thought about that idea already tonight.  Like 49 seconds ago.  He was responding to Skippy's away message which was "Why all this drama" and Tyke responded with this: cuz without drama the high moments wouldn't be as high and we would basically be living in a social state where instead of having highs and lows we just had variations of the middle.  It was meant to just be sorta funny as he answered what was prolly a rhetorical question but he did it anyway.  And it does have its point.  Cuz really, the pain, anguish, and disappointment keeps the ecstacy of other feelings to a higher level.  All of this seems so obvious to Tyke that he feels there is no reason to even type it though.  That is one problem with his advice.  He hates how it seems so simple and bland.  He really wants to make up something paradoxical or highly intellectual that nobody has thought of before but that just isn't possible.  So instead he talks about his 5th grade romances.  But in the end, it all comes back to the times you passed by.  No it doesn't.  Or does it?  Tyke thinks it doesn't.  So that means it doesn't.  It all comes down to looks.  No, that isn't right.  Personality?  No.  Ohhhhh, Tyke knows.  It comes down to your willingness to divulge all your feelings.  Well, if it is...then Tyke is in GREAT SHAPE.  Time to go do some crunches yo.

      Get this folks.  At one point tonight, Tyke considered not actually blogging.  Well not really.  He just thought that of all the nights ever, this would be one where he might not do it.  But he did it.  Or at least started it.  He will find out later if he finished it.  But today was February 1st.  It didn't really mean much to him though.  Just that tomorrow is February 2nd and that Tuesday is February 3rd.  Both days will suck.  You friends need to make it not suck.  Come on, help a white brother out.  He is supposed to start presenting tomorrow in English and that is going to be terrible.  Absolutely bombing that probably.  Kinda like he did in the class.  He is needing to do something miraculous in there.  But his speech has no central topic or anything.  It is just rambling.  And not good ramblings like in this blog.  Just stupid stuff that isn't intelligient.  He is simply saying obvious things over and over.  But oh well, at least he can just get it over with soon.  And he is almost completely done with 1st semester.  Once grades come out he will be happy.  Sort of.  Hopefully nothing bad will happen.  But worrying is bad.  And too often people worry.  Tyke went over to Trew-fanator's with Skippy, Samantha, Macaroon, and Amed today.  Some of Trew-f's friends were there as well but Tyke isn't a friend of them so...But it was fun.  For the first half at least.  The half-time show sucked though.  It was funny though when Janet Jackson showed her right tit.  Yeah, that was weird live.  Tyke just thought it was staged and it wasn't real anyway.  However, upon getting home and checking out Fark he ended up getting told otherwise.  It was real and she had a tassle over the nipple or something.  But the half-time still sucked.  And MTV probably won't do another half-time show ever again.  Which might be a good thing.  Tyke should do a half-time show of his own.  Just him dancing and making faces.  And playing basketball.  And blogging, live.  Live blogging would be a sight indeed.  Maybe even him thinking about stuff.  That is interesting to him usually.  Not others but to him it is.  Well anyway, Tyke didn't see many commercials he really liked.  There was one though.  The one for Chevrolet which had the kids all with soap bars in their mouth.  And then at the end the kid sees the Chevy changing its top and yells out "Oh sh..."  That was a good commercial.  The first Chevy commercial sucked.  It was for the tiny Geo Metro-style car.  That thing is bitch ugly.  It is a freaking 4-door POS.  It should be shot.  And then they had 4 tall basketball players get in it (although they didn't actually show them getting in the car).  But it was terrible.  Why would anyone want to buy that car???  Who cares if it is less than 10K.  That is still an ugly ass car.  Yeesh, Tyke's car is probably faster than it too.  Man, he HATES that car.  Loathes it.               Tyke left Trew-f's house during the 3rd quarter and came home to do nothing.  He ate a bunch of candy and cookies and Gushers though.  Then he started on his speech while watching the SB.  He saw the end and was mad.  Stupid luck/blunder.  Well, then he watched Survivor All-Stars cuz there is a really hot chick on there.  And then he kept working and occasionally chatting online.  He also has become pretty proficient at blogging now.  Fast enough to get it done without much problem.  Nonetheless, he still takes close to 20 minutes probably.  But he has long toenails he just realized.  Oh well, Poppin Them Thangs is a good song.  So he will listen to it.  And he wants to sleep now.  He didn't sleep much on Sunday.  And was tired earlier in the day.  Damn stupid stuff.  Oh well, Fer Fer is gonna try and have a good day tomorrow.  No Tina in 1st period so he will be focusing on math.  Which has actually been a decent move.  He has still had fun.  Just for those of you that care the pic on his monitor is no longer there nor is the banner on his cell phone.  Should any of you know what those things are, you may be happy.  Or at least surprised.  Don't be surprised that Tyke finished the blog.  He always finishes.  Sometimes 2nd.

      February!!!!  Another new month, the last January of high school is now past and the last February has just begun.  It is only a little over an hour old by the way.  Saturday was a decent day.  Tyke didn't do too much in the means of going places though.  He woke up about 11:30 and his mom, as usual, greeted him with "Morning, sleepy head" as she almost always does on Saturdays cuz he sleeps with reckless abandonment.  After getting up he talked to Haras for a little while about her Friday night and their plans and such.  Nice and relaxing to start off Saturday.  His brother had come home for a few hours so they chatted and played some PS2 together.  Then he left and right afterwards he went to Cougar Ridge to watch some of the Amed-Skippy battle of the ball.  Basketball.  Skippy ended up taking the W 19-17 and that meant that Amed owed him a dinner.  They decided to go to Teriyaki Bistro for the meal.  Well, Tyke ended up going home right after that as there was nothing else to do.  But he took a circuitous route home.  He went down to South Cove after getting off the mountain and took the Meerwood turn, dropping by Purdy's neighborhood.  He didn't go to her house, just past the turn into her neighborhood.  Then he went towards Tina's house but turned up to get back on the main road before going to her actual house.  He drove by Tig'Ol on that path so it ended up being a positive decision to take that route.  Just because he saw one person.  It was successful.  He came home and then just sorta sat around for like 4 hours.  He talked to Purdy for a while.  They talked about traveling some and about Tyke's trip to Europe and how Purdy should come with him but can't.  Sorta like nobody will be able to come with him cuz they would have to pay for their own airfare so that would cost like $2000.  But if you want to go with him, still just let him know and he will see about getting you in.  That is, if he would like for you to come along.  And there are some of you he would really like to have come along.  After talking to her he had dinner with his family and he doesn't remember what they talked about.  Then he helped his dad put some phone numbers into his cell phone (which he got about 6 months ago).  After that he went downstairs and waited for Skippy, Amed, K-caj, and Kinker to come over.  They started off with MOH and while playing the game K-caj showed off his new songs on the piano.  A few tunes from Mario!!!  It is hella tight really.  Like the star song is really cool.  But they are all really good.  Macaroon came over later and brought Halo so they played that for a while.  Tyke and Skippy owned after the first round.  They lost only once.  It was great.  Actually, it was just fine.  Decent, adequate.  Average.  However, the best part of the night came when it was just Tyke, Kinker, and Macaroon.  They started playing cards and they played Shithead and then Ratscrew.  It was fun but then they started playing one of the best card games ever.  It started out with the game Bingo.  This is not the Bingo you know.  This is the Bingo that was created at Dr. Phil's house over the summer by Macaroon, Tyke, and Dr. Phil.  However, Tyke decided to start changing the rules and he did.  Then Kinker and Macaroon did the same.  And they created....CHINKO!!!!  This game is so much fun.  It is a mixture of many different games.  Some of these include Gin Rummy, Jenga, Memory Match, Basketball, and Go Fish.  These are just the noticeable ones.  There are prolly others too.  The game is just a jumbled mess of cards scattered all around.  And then you have to match cards and stuff.  He doesn't want to explain it on here cuz it takes away from some of the fun of the LIVE EXPERIENCE.  But next time you are with Tyke and run out of things to do but have cards, just play this game.  It is better with more people though.  It is so much fun.  Wow, he really loved playing.  Tyke is going to try and keep thinking of ways to add to the game.  He is trying to see if there is a way he could toss in the element of betting to the game.  Perhaps, and if he does then it would probably be enjoyed by even more people.  So anyway, his day was somewhat eventful but he is still really happy from his Friday night.  That was a great night.  He just keeps looking back and saying that it was really fun and wants to do it again soon.  Real soon.  Like EVERYDAY!!!  That would be fun.  It was funny and entertaining.  Kinda like Tyke Turner.  Actually, very much like Tyke.  Just imagine all the little kids who are saying "I wanna be like Tyke."  He could maybe even make a commercial for his blog that included a bunch of kids saying "I wanna be like Tyke."  Would you want to be in the commercial?

      Yessss, break is here.  Ahhhh, its going to be nice.  Just sit back and relax for a week.  Not have to do anything.  Soooo nice.  So here's how the day unfolded.  1st period there was a test and it was really stupid cuz the dumb teacher put a problem on there that was pretty much impossible.  Tyke talked to others in the class and they said the exact same thing as him.  They knew how to do the problem that was like the one on the test but the one on the test was made so that it was pretty much impossible.  It was just really gay.  2nd period was cool cuz Tyke found out he has a new student in there.  He won't name him yet cuz if you only get mentioned once then there isn't much reason to have a name for you.  But Tyke didn't really work out much other than having a mini-competition on who could bench the bar the most times.  It is pretty tough to do for a long time.  The bar doesn't seem heavy but the arms get so tired that they can't go up anymore.  That is when you stop.  3rd period was a total change from what was supposed to happen.  It was supposed to be a party-atmosphere but it sucked.  They ended up watching more of a stupid movie and Tyke and Purdy definitely weren't happy.  4th period was easy.  Talked about something.  Tyke doesn't actually remember what it was.  But they had 2 sing-a-grams and then also they listened to a few more songs, including Doc P's.  Lunch was fun; went to Costco for it to save some money.  Good hot dog today.  And the warm sun was very nice on Tyke's neck.  Very nice.  5th period was fun.  Just cuz of Tyke's little mini-escapade.  Tyke went on his usual bathroom trip past Skippy's class and talked to him for a little bit.  That was cool, then he went to the bathroom.  He walked around a little and said hi to some people and then he saw Shawna.  So he said hi to her and walked and talked with her.  Then she said she needed to find Tina and another girl to have a picture taken.  Well of course Tyke knows what class they have because he is always out during 5th period so he sees where everyone is.  So he went and they got Tina out of class.  They walked over to the Yearbook room and stood around.  Tyke was going to take the place of the other girl in the picture.  But they ended up not taking the picture :(.  It sucked!  So Tyke had to settle with just talking a little more and then leaving for his class.  It turned out that Macaroon needed to go to the bathroom the whole time Tyke was on his journey.  Whoops!  Oh well.  6th period was fun.  Tyke popped out some more accents and read from the Physics textbook.  His funny voices were adored.  Anyways, after school Tyke said goodbye to Purdy for a week and then the gang headed up to Tyke's to play bball.  It was a lot of fun this time.  They played at this court kinda by Tyke's house and it was really weird.  It was a nice little place but the backboard had no backboard.  It was missing the glass.  So the ball could go through the "backboard."  That caused some trouble.  The team of Tyke and Big Twigg lost the first game to the 3 undersized players but then won the next two thanks to Tyke's inside dominance and driving abilities...not his outside shooting.  He also drained his free throws, which came in handy the next games.  They played some 21 and Tyke won every time.  Then they played bounce 21 and Doc P managed to win that Tyke believes.  Whoa, he actually forgot.  But Tyke did dominate.  Actually Tyke might have won that game, shoot he doesn't remember.  Oh well, then they played a game of T-I-G.  Doc P shot the gayest shots ever.  One hand, no jump shots from everywhere.  He wouldn't stop.  Tyke hit a few but couldn't hit them with the insane luck that Doc P had so he ended up being the first out.  So then they went home.  And at 6:30 Tyke met up with Macaroon and Dr. Phil at Subway and they had a great dinner.  Then they went into GI Joes before going to Dr. Phil's work.  The manager guy kept following them around at GI Joes.  It was super stupid of him.  First he told them they couldn't "use the frisbees inside."  How dumb is that?  They couldn't toss them 2 feet (literally 2 feet) to test them out???  Reaaaal gay.  Anyway, to make a long story short...Tyke, Macaroon, and Kinker hung out at Tyke's.  They played some games and then Dr. Phil came over after work and he joined the festivities.  It was a gay ol night of fun.  Tomorrow (today should be fun too).  The girls should win.  Tyke, the number one fan will be there for sure.  But he will be sleeping through the boys game.  No doubt about that :)!!!

      No real intro today, just starting right in with the blog.  1st period was pretty easy.  Went over a group test that Tyke's group got 100% on.  Tyke wrote a funny answer to the explanation part of a problem and the teacher said she was laughing while she read it.  That is a good thing.  Anyway, after that they just shat around for an hour.  After that Tyke went to 2nd period and had a sub in there.  So that meant that he didn't have to work out.  And it was perfect cuz it was power clean day.  Tyke actually worked out his legs a bit, enough to make them tired after school in fact.  3rd period Tyke had a test about Congress and the budget.  Stupid test as there were a few questions that were almost repeated verbatim.  After the test they just shat around for a few minutes and then class was over.  4th period was also easy.  They talked about a stupid little paragraph in a stupid book for about 30 minutes.  Purdy tried to get the teacher to just move onto the quiz but BOOM she got shot down.  The teach just started screeching out how it is important to be learning the stuff and not taking quizzes or something along those lines.  They took the quiz and Tyke of course made some nice and funny answers as usual.  Similar to math.  Then they listened to one more song. Purdy's song.  Even though Tyke brought it in.  But Hands Down is just a plain great song.  Ok, off to lunch went the crew.  Tyke raced Doc P to Tyke's car and owned him.  No chance of outrunning Tyke.  If you are Doc P that is.  Some people are faster than him.  The gang went down to Pie and it was a pleasurable eat.  Mmmm.  As usual, when Macaroon went out to the bathroom the guys got up and ran to Tyke's car.  They were going to go around and actually pick up Macaroon right outside the door he comes out of but he got out too soon so it ended up looking like Tyke was just trying to drive away.  No hard feelings.  There isn't any animosity between people if it seems like there is.  It is just harmless kidding among guys.  Good times.  5th period was easy.  It was funny cuz Tyke and Macaroon made Tyke's logo for the school.  It is so hideous.  Eagle head, salmon torso, Indian legs.  Funny but hilariously hideous.  An odd match.  As is Tyke.  6th period trudged along though.  Just a simple lab between friends and it made it really easy.  Tyke hasn't finished it yet but he'll do that with Purdy in english tomorrow.  Or maybe Gov.  One of the two.  Tyke just putzed around and made jokes for the rest of the period and had a grand ol time.  After that they got out of school early for a pep assembly.  Not that anybody really went but it was just getting out of school 10 minutes early.  This is where the real interesting part started.  At least to Tyke.  Tyke and Purdy were talking about how she might not go to the boys bball game because of some reasons.  Well, Tyke tackled those reasons head on.  Here's how it came out.  Tyke and Purdy both drove to BCC (site of game at night) and parked Purdy's car as close to the gym as they could.  Then Tyke picked her up there and took her to her work which is semi-near the school.  So they sat around in the car waiting for her work to start and played some cards.  She somehow managed to win everytime but twice in Hold Em.  Stupid luck.  Well she went to work and then Tyke went over to Macaroon's house.  The two just shot around in the blazing heat and played some nice bball.  Really fun to play in a summer-esque environment.  And that is what it felt like.  Well after playing for a little while Tyke went on home.  He got home, ate some food, rested up, got the trash, did some laundry, and pretty much everything but homework cuz that isn't fun.  At 6 though he left and went to Purdy's work again as he was picking her up and then taking her to the game where her car already was.  It was a great plan made up by Tyke.  No flaws at all.  And it was fun.  So they got to the game and Tyke talked with Doc P, Macaroon, and Kinker.  Looks like Doc P won with the closest bet of the score.  Tyke was kinda close but the end screwed him.  The dunk off the pass off the glass was pretty sick.  Kinda like "the play."  Well after the game Tyke and Purdy went to her car and then she drove him to his car where he gave her back her stuff and they split.  Tyke came home and talked with his parents for a little and found out he has the house to himself for much of tomorrow.  And they gave him some money.  If only he had something to do tomorrow.  A lot of people are busy.  Or gone.  Or both.  Kinda sad.  He'll find something to do.  Surely he won't go bored.  Ok, not much to say.  It was a pretty good day.  Tyke is always wanting more, but who isn't?  Sometime though.  Sometime...  Well here is an edit to the blog.  It is totally unexpected Tyke would think and very much not like Tyke.  Tonight, for some reason or another, Tyke felt like doing a couple shots of something or drinking something.  Yeah, that is not like Tyke.  He still is the same morally but he just felt like getting drunk in a way.  He didn't, nor has he ever.  He hasn't really had much of anything to drink ever.  But tonight was a different mindset.  Ok, thats all.  Think about that one.  Ok, part deux now.  Or part tres really.  Tyke.  The mind of Tyke.  It is really tough with this over-exhaustive mind Tyke has.  He can't control it.  It never stops thinking about stuff.  And it is just topics like girls and...no, mainly girls.  It is a curse he has.  Oh, and this is serious talk.  So he isn't ever trying to be funny.  But really, this is all just about his troubles.  He can never stop thinking about girls and how much he wants what he can't have.  That has been his biggest problem in life.  Reaching for the unattainable.  And don't say there aren't unattainable girls.  Cuz that is a lie.  Tyke's experiences are proof enough for him.  And it seems to Tyke that girls must have a type that they like.  It may seem like there isn't but people do change so it must be that people's types change.  Although that would kind of defeat the purpose of having a type.  Whatever, it's stupid.  Tyke is just...fuck this...Purdy wanted Tyke to write this but she is offline now so he might as well just quit.  It isn't helping him.  This is all so stupid.  So so stupid.

      Tyke time.  Wednesday was really a little bit above par as a whole.  The day started off great but Tyke wasn't as refreshed as he thought he might be from his sleepy sleep.  He only got about 9 hours so it wasn't like he was getting that much more than usual.  The day started out great though as Tyke was walking to class and he found out right away before even entering the class that there was a sub in 1st period.  Wow, now that was quite a blessing.  So Tyke and Maniak walked to his Maniak's locker and told the teacher that they were going to "watch Varsity TV."  But Tyke realized they really had nothing to do so he just went back inside the class.  He played some poker though and ended up losing a buck by going all in on the first hand.  Oh well, it was a fun time.  He was the dealer after that and he showed his insane dealing skills.  So that was pleasureful.  After that he went on over to 2nd period weight training.  It was a good time as it was cardio day and that means...8 MINUTE ABS!!!!  Tyke is not being sarcastic when he says he loves doing ab-work.  He truly does do ab stuff a lot, as you may have noticed from his away message.  He isn't going to brag though and say he has a definitive 6-pack or anything like that...he'll just leave that to the imagination of the female readers of this blog.  You know who you are.  Mmm yeahhhhh.  3rd period involved another sub.  So it was dub-sub day.  They were "watching" a video on the Republican Contract with America but really they were playing Hangman and dressing Purdy up as Tyke.  Wow, now that was a hot sight.  Nothing like seeing a girl dressed up like you and the freakish resemblance she can bear to you.  But the glasses and hat were hot.  Tyke pwned Dotti's Hangman choices but they were indelibly sweet and her mellifluous (sweet sounding, kinda like euphony-bold word from ch. 19 in AP Eng by the way)voice made the sensation of victory even more enjoyable.  4th period was great cuz Tyke and the class just listened to music the whole period.  And it was supposed to be educational too.  Tyke of course made up his hilarious dances and sang along to the recognizable tunes.  Man he's a good dancer.  He should have his own dance show like that one guy did on MTV.  Whatever his name was.  He wasn't as hot as Tyke so it would be even better if Tyke did it.  He could call it "Tyke Turner's Tremendous Tango, Tap, and Twist Telecast."  But they would do more than just tango, tap, and twist.  They would do all sorts of dancing.  Like DDR stuff.  And rave dances.  Ya know, where you make a ball with your hands.  Tyke does that a lot.  He sucks, but he does it a lot.  But no dance twister.  Damn that game.  Good gift but it kinda ended up sucking.  It isn't twister and it isn't dancing.  So it's really a lie in the title of the game.  Maybe Tyke could sue and make some money.  Oooooo...money.  Where was he?  Ahh yes, lunch.  The gang went out to McDonald's again for lunch.  Tyke, Amed, and Doc P ran to the car cuz it was so nice out.  Something Macaroon NEVER does.  Stupid man.  He should do that.  It is wicked fun.  It was sooooo warm and just NOSome out.  Tyke just rolled down the window and put his left arm out while driving.  It's kind of funny how Tyke drives out to lunch every single day.  He does it by his own accord (not the car) and seems to revel in its splendiferous nature.  Mmmm...vocabulary.  Upon re-arrival from lunch and the walk towards the school Tyke looked out towards the parking lot and for some odd reason he saw this van parked in the Visitor stall and it caught his eye.  He noticed the rims and thought, hey those look like the ones on his mom's.  He can tell cuz the rims on his mom's are kinda cool and not normal.  Well he kept walking and noticed it was his mom's car as he could tell by the license plate.  So he spent the rest of the day trying to figure out why she was at school.  Everyone was saying it was cuz she was checking his grades but he knew that couldn't be plausible or feasible (last time he tried to say those words he mixed them and said flausible or pleasible or something).  6th period was fun except for the vocab quiz.  Tyke actually likes the student teacher they have in there.  For the past two weeks she has been cool.  When she teaches they don't really have to pay attention and they make jokes and she goes along with them so it is fun.  Basically Tyke gets to talk more than normal so he enjoys that.  But after school Tyke went out to Purdy's car to get his jacket back as she had been wearing it some and it smelled "like boy" but he wanted it back.  He ran the Turner move with Kinker and his sis so they got in the car and Tyke was fearful of not getting to back out of his spot like so many times he can't.  But there was Tina saving the day.  She let him back out and leave as she was coming to bball practice.  Then Amed came over and made sure that the bball plans were still on at his house after school.  They were.  So Tyke went home and changed quickly.  While writing his mom a note/calling her to tell her where he was going he noticed something odd all over the main floor.  Pictures of Tyke were everywhere.  Not that he minds, the vain ham that he is, but it was not a normal occurrence in the Turner household.  That, he realized, must have been the reason Tyke's mom was at school today.  Cuz she was doing Senior Slide Show or Senior picture stuff.  Cuz when he called her she said "she had some business to take care of there" as her excuse for being there.  But Tyke had no fears.  Instead he just went up to Amed's and played some bball with Macaroon, Skippy, Maniak, Fejj, and Doc P.  It was fun.  Tyke won 21 again.  He really loves being able to win.  It is great.  He just keeps taking it to the house.  Some weird black guy there told the gang that he couldn't get kicked off and if they tried to play a full-court game he was "in the first 10."  But he just randomly told them that.  Kinda freaky.  He was an imposing figure to Tyke.  Big and black.  Mainly big.  After most people had left, Tyke, Maniak, Amed, and Fejj all played against these 3 sophomores Tyke thinks.  Maniak knew them apparently but Tyke didn't.  The seniors just goofed around and had fun while the other kids actually tried.  It was stupid of them but they had to try and win.  They probably did but when Tyke just turns and throws the ball at the hoop he isn't trying to play.  And when they make everyone go to one side of the court, or the top of the key, or all in the key, or all outside the 3-point line, they aren't trying.  To sum up, Tyke went home after that and just kinda lazed around for a while.  Hasn't actually done any homework yet but he might before he goes to sleep.  Perhaps, not set yet.  Tyke isn't going to be playing the Sly Lioners on Friday cuz Purdy is supposedly going out with Ekul.  Pah!  Tyke should be going out with Ekul.  But not in a gay way.  In a basketball playing way where Kinker is there too.  Nope, that made it gayer.  Not gay though.  Straight stuff. Basketball.  Opposite of gay.  Not that there's anything wrong with that (repeat usage).

      Tuesday night blogs are always a joy to do because they mean that he will soon be going to sleep for a long time (or at least 2 extra hours).  But today was fun for the most part and a pleasurable experience.  Tyke had a math test 1st period.  It was group and it was pretty easy.  Triple Threat joined the group and made it easier.  Hopefully the solo test Tyke takes on Friday will be simple.  Nonetheless he doesn't care cuz it is just math.  2nd period was really quite tiring.  When you actually work out the whole period in weight training you really get tired.  Your muscles get very very tired.  But hopefully he will build up some strength and especially in his legs so that he gets a bigger vertical.  3rd period was stupid.  Just stupid lectures on stupid stuff that "you guys need to know."  So pretty much everything in that class is "need to know" information."  Really, if it wasn't something the class needed to know then why would she teach it???  Of course they know that everything is important.  Yeesh.  4th period was pretty fun.  All they did was listen to music.  Hopefully tomorrow they do the same.  At lunch they headed off to Costco and Tyke got a nice hot dog meal.  It was a great purchase for less than 2 bucks.  If only it were closer he could get pizza and everything there with plenty of time.  After lunch the day kinda breezed by.  After school was where the fun started.  After the walk with Purdy and Skippy to the p-lot Tyke drove on home.  He changed and called his mom to tell her he was going out.  In the call she asked him if his grades had come in the mail yet because she heard the message about the grading problem that the school had.  So he lied and said that he hadn't received grades yet.  Just to buy him some more time so that he didn't have to make anything up on the spot.  Then he went over to Amed's and was joined by Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Skippy, K-caj, and a little later Maniak.  They went to the court by Amed's house and played some hoops.  Tyke won the game of 21 they played despite his initial struggles with the double rim.  He then just took it to the house.  It was pure inside domination!  They played some 3-4 games after that.  Every time the team of 4 won.  It was fun though.  Tyke just showed how good he is when he posts up and takes it to the hoop against the defense.  Good to know for his future games.  And he still just kept hitting the free throws.  He doesn't know how he got so good at those all of a sudden but he did.  He just feels really comfortable shooting them.  He knows how to shoot them really.  And as long as his arms or legs aren't dead tired he is a dead on shot.  Basketball is really fun.  It's too bad he only played 2 years of competitive ball.  Not that he would be playing varsity now.  But ya never know.  Well after bball the gang went back to Amed's and Tyke had a Fuze (really good drink when you only have half of it) and another Nature Valley.  Then they played some Halo.  It was quite a bit of fun.  Tyke and Skippy won both games they played in and left at 5 with an undefeated record.  Good times.  After that, Tyke went home and he was really tired.  So he just kinda dropped onto his bed face first with the lights on and everything and just stared at the light on the charger of his cell phone.  And he was so comfortable that he just dozed off.  He woke up about 6:30 to the screams of his parents telling him dinner was ready.  So he went up and had dinner.  One topic of conversation was grades.  Tyke's grades.  But he played it perfectly.  He told his mom that he didn't get his grades but he knew what they were.  He told them the truth for all grades except for English.  He just didn't want to have to deal with the consequences of his english grade so he just said he got a B+.  They still talked to him about his math and physics grades cuz they weren't good either.  So they started talking about college and work ethic and stuff like that.  Tyke doesn't push himself at all but he knows he can so he just needs to prove to himself that if he tries to he can focus and do the work and get good grades.  That is why he might actually do some work this semester.  Just to prove himself right.  So anyway after that he played some NBA2K3 and shot some hoops downstairs and just hung out.  He hasn't really been talking much to people online.  Mainly just Amed and Purdy lately.  Maybe its laziness but who knows.  Kinker hasn't been on much so that is why he doesn't talk to him.  Occasionally Haras when she is on and Dotti sometimes but not much.  Its more of independent time for Tyke now when he is at home.  All in all, Tyke is tired.  So bye.

      So, here Tyke goes again with the second blog of the night.  This one will be a little tedious cuz if you don't know it is tiring and somewhat boring writing these extended blogs night in and night out.  But they do "cause pleasure" for Tyke in the long run.  Ok, Tyke wrote that last line 15 minutes ago cuz Macaroon just called him and they were talking for a while.  Tyke had to sorta defend himself cuz of one of his decisions during the day.  Even though it wasn't his fault but whatever, you'll hear in a bit.  1st period=gay today.  It wasn't too bad but the teacher is a fucking douchebag.  She is soooo stupid.  2nd period was fine and Tyke was owning everyone in his groups in squats and other leg stuff.  He was just pounding out the reps like it was nothing.  Sure he was only repping 165 but still, he does have pretty good legs.  That's why he can get up on his leaps.  3rd period was cool and the rest of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was pretty good.  At least the ending was funny.  And the Boy Rangers part.  Man, that is pretty messed up what those guys did to the Boy Rangers.  4th period was fun.  It was poetry reading day.  Tyke read 3 haikus.  He read his first two after Amed went.  The former of Tyke's two poems seemed to get a nice outcry from the peanut gallery as it was about his wanton.  Then he decided to just read those two and sat back down to savor the intellectual stimuli that were to be read.  Some were pretty good he thought.  After everybody went Tyke was pressured into reading some of his dirtier ones.  He read the "Elongated Shaft" one and right after the teacher said, "Tyke, I think I feel a theme in your poems."  Tyke took this as a hint that she was trying to censor him so he left the "Virgin tongues in lust" haiku in his pocket and was pleased with the reactions of the class.  He at least showed more of his creative side and humorous view on life if nothing else.  For lunch Tyke went with the gang to Pie and got some damn good cheese pizza.  That ish is hott!  Ekul was there and Tyke talked to him for a bit and he challenged Tyke to another game but this time they had their original player back on their squad so they wanna play.  Well, Tyke said he would be willing to play as he just loves the game.  So this time Tyke is going to pick the court and he will probably pick a new third player to join him and Kinker.  They are definitely going to play on a 10' hoop though.  Tyke stipulated that at the girls basketball game he went to with Purdy at night.  For some reason the Sly Lioners are afraid of the 10' monster in their face so Tyke is going to have to whip it out and beat them with it.  Such a great line right there.  Who knows who the Quah will pick for their final member of the Trio of Dominance though.  It could be most anyone.  Tyke has already improved since last time and his skills on the 10' hoop are much better than a wet 8 footer.  So the game will be a classic again.  Perhaps the comm center for the locale.  It worked well for Tyke last time.  He would like to play on a different court though.  He would love to just play at the court by his house.  That would be something.  The rim is super freaky hard.  It bounces everything out but Tyke knows it pretty well.  And the court is decent too.  And it is by Tyke's house so that makes it better too.  But all will be decided soon.  After school Tyke was called by Macaroon and he offered a game of hoops up on Coug Mount but Tyke didn't really want to drive up there knowing that he would have to come all the way back in not too long and he still had to write a paper.  Even though he didn't think he was going to the girls game that night he still wanted to get it done.  So he declined.  Well then Purdy told him that she was in fact going to make it to the girls game so he decided that since he already had like 5/7 of it done he might as well get out of the house and hang out with some girls (mainly just to hang out with a bunch of girls).  The game was fun even with the freaky Sly Lion dads sitting in front of Tyke, Purdy, and Tina.  This one guy had mad dandruff (mandruff) and not to mention he kept licking himself like he was a cat.  It was freaky.  Purdy kept putting her finger like right by the mandruff and it was freaking out Tyke.  Then she got elbowed by the Cat Man when he started jumping up and down and feeling up some fellow fathers around him.  It was a scary time but still fun.  Scary=fun in some cases.  Other times it equals horrible.  But not often.  Or like maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of the time.  Somewhere in there.  Tyke came home though at 7:02 and this was the first odd revelation to him.  He opened the door and all of the freaking lights were out!!!  And it was only 7:02!!!  His parents had already called it a night at 7.  That is just weird.  Tyke goes to bed around 11 every night and gets up at about 6 every morning.  And he is still sorta growing so he needs sleep way more than his parents.  However he will acknowledge the fact that on many occasions his mom gets about 2 hours of sleep cuz of work.  That is a frequent occurrence.  The other odd thing was that Tyke saw a message from Macaroon saying something along the lines of, "thanks for ditching me you ungrateful bastard."  Along those lines.  Well, Tyke not only didn't mean to ditch him but he didn't even make an effort to ditch him like he will occasionally do if he is really trying to ditch someone (which never happens).  But really, there is nothing there as the two are still friends and all and they hang out like all the time.  But anyway, Tyke still needs to finish his paper and print it off so hope you enjoyed double blog day.  Maybe it was even better than double stamp day!  Probably not though.

      Well, what a bitch Sunday night's blog attempt was.  He wrote out his night and day and finally had something terse but ramblescent.  So Tyke will try and recant his recounts of Sunday.  It started out pretty good, waking at 10:30 and then being a lazy Tyke in bed for about half an hour.  Then he got up and took a nice, long, warm, chlorinated (stupid Sammamish Water people) shower.  In the midst of his drying off his naked body he heard the incessant ring of the telephone in the other room.  Although he was not clothed at all he dashed out into the rec room in full view of the window and picked up the phone.  He managed to drag the towel with him though and covered up his most intimate of locales while pushing the talk button in the middle of the 4th ring.  It was quite an accomplishment really.  To no surprise it was Macaroon on the other end.  The two decided they would hang out for the day.  A good choice seeing as Saturday Tyke sat around his house by himself so he really needed to get out and just do something.  So at 1 Tyke went over to Macaroon's where K-Caj already was.  They played around and waited for Dr. Phil to come over.  The 4 of them started up some Halo and then a little later Amed came over and joined in on the action.  It was a grand old time.  However, they got the hankering for some chow.  They all piled in the Shitmobile...er, Shevmobile and meandered on down Forest Drive to Factoria.  They went over to Red Robin and got some chow.  After they got the checks they noticed that the waiter/server/whatever they are called these days had managed to forget to include an order of fries, a drink, and had marked Tyke's "Freckled Lemonade" as a regular drink.  What a nice guy!  Or maybe he was just an idiot.  Tyke is leaning more towards the second one.  But while at Red Robin Tyke saw Dotti's entire family.  Minus Dotti that is.  She was at home working on school work or something along those unfortunate lines.  After food the guys trekked over to BIG 5 and then back to the car.  They went back to Macaroon's and they all got in their own cars and headed up to Cougar Ridge for a basketball affair.  The gang played some 21 and Tyke was just on fire.  He got tipped repeatedly and literally ended up scoring 60+ points in that one game.  He finally won though as Amed just couldn't handle Tyke's tremendous talent.  They played a game of HORSE and Tyke won.  They played bounce 21 and Tyke won.  They played another game of 21 and Tyke won.  Yeah, a good day.  Tyke is really feeling his game now.  He has drastically improved since his first real game of the year against the Sly Lioners.  Speaking of them...oh wait, you would probably have already read Monday's blog but if not you will read about that later.  Well Tyke is really good at hitting his free throws now too.  Like about 90%.  That is really good.  He just feels it every time.  After it was just Tyke, Amed, and Macaroon, the gang decided to take on these three guys that had rudely taken the other end of the court from them.  Tyke's crew flat out owned on those bastards.  They got schooled.  Pwned.  l337 h4x0rd.  Oh yeah, they were 11 years old.  And one kid was probably like 7.  But he was a ferocious little feline.  He was hounding Tyke when he had the ball.  Tyke would just dribble circles around him or bounce the ball over his head.  Tyke knocked him over a couple times cuz the kid kept running into Tyke's man-bod.  The kid got revenge though by slobbering all over Tyke's hand and getting full on grabbing of both Tyke's ass cheeks on one play.  Kind of a weird kid.  Very similar to Amed though.  Anyway, after the game Tyke went home and just hung out.  But he did get to talk to Haras in the day as they chatted in the morning about normal subjects (Tyke doesn't remember now as it was over a day ago).  He got to text Dotti a couple of times and kinda see her cuz he saw her family which is almost like seeing her.  And he talked to Purdy online at night and she was even in a talkative mood so that was great.  They talked about their youths a little bit and how Tyke used to perform dances when his relatives came over.  This one time he took off his Portland Trail Blazers hat and threw it into the crowd as his big finale and it drilled his aunt right in the face.  She wasn't that hurt though so it wasn't too bad.  Ok, well time to write Monday's blog.

      Today's blog will have not only a recap of the day but also there will be some feelings interjected here and there.  Mainly there.  Just cuz, ya know, when ya got em, show em.  No need to muck these feelings.  Even though he would muck them if he could.  Well, he can muck them but he means that Tyke would rather just not feel this way.  Here's how today went though.  Tyke got up and showered and then he ate a little.  Then he called Ekul and told him the game was on for the day.  He called up Macaroon telling him that he was going to be their 3rd to join with Tyke and Kinker and he was up for it so that was good.  Then Tyke made his jersey.  He had this old Hot Shots jersey from soccer and he didn't care about it but it was a cool jersey so he took it and cut off the short sleeves and the collar and it ended up looking pretty cool for being a real easy job.  It looks kinda like a basketball jersey in fact.  Later on Macaroon came over and they hung out for a while, waiting for Kinker to come over.  When Kinker came they left for Kramm's house and the game.  It was a good game indeed.  Tyke guarded Ekul but Ekul guarded Macaroon.  Macaroon didn't really play up to par.  Probably a double bogey in fact.  Tyke was solid though.  MVP for the team, in fact.  This is based solely on sheer dominance of the paint and percentage of the team's points.  It was another OT thriller but it never really felt that close, even when Team Good was down to game point.  But they pulled it out on Tyke's fadeaway J to put them up 2-0 in the books.  They own at Kramm's house.  Can't be beat.  It was a really fun game.  Tyke scored 15 points of the 25 if they all counted correctly later on that night.  Kinker had 8 and Macaroon had 2.  Which might have been 1 more than Big Twigg had last time he was the 3rd.  So he did well enough.  He had a couple of nice airballs that Tyke plucked out of the air and put in for buckets.  Tyke really had control of the paint.  He was a behemoth on the boards as he says.  After the game the three drove around the plateau a little on their way back to Tyke's.  They tried to see if they could find any of the girls basketball team but they couldn't but they did see BIG's house and saw some nice houses on a beautiful day.  Upon arriving back at the Bachelor Pad they played some ESPN and then they all left.  Tyke took a shower and pretty much left right after that for Dairy Queen in Eastgate for his dinner.  It was good.  Macaroon met up with him there and then they went to BCC for the girls game.  Parking was not possible in most of the area so they had to go all the way back to the normal spots and park there.  It was a fun adventure though.  Then they went in and just sat and tried to create their own cheering section but were pretty unsuccessful as there were a lot of Beach people there and they are scary.  They just are.  So they sat and watched that with Kinker for a while and then Purdy came and she sat in front of them.  The game was really not fun at all though.  Tyke did not have fun.  He hardly talked at all and it just wasn't fun.  Wasn't what he was expecting.  They lost and that just made it worse but it just wasn't as fun as it usually is.  Probably because of the way everyone was seated.  Oh well, can't win em all.  After the game Tyke, Purdy, Kinker, Frederique, and Macaroon waited around for Tina to talk to her about going bowling.  She said she was gonna go so that was cool.  She just had to take the bus back.  So Tyke and Purdy drove over to Sun Villa and Ekul was there so Tyke and him talked for a little but then Tyke, Kinker, and Macaroon watched other people bowl for about 25 minutes or so.  It was entertaining at times but not really fun and since bowling cost $5 a game Kinker and Macaroon said they weren't going to bowl.  So it was stupid for a while.  Then Kram and Frederique and Tina and Shawna all showed up so there were more people there.  They got their lanes and went to bowl.  Tyke couldn't find a ball he liked at all so he just settled with one that was pretty bad.  He started off pretty horribly but managed to pick it up and got exactly 100.  Which considering he bowled horribly the entire game really, he did pretty well.  Tyke talked with Purdy and Ekul for most of the time and only talked with Tina a little.  It was still cool though cuz they never hang out.  But then after only one game Ekul and Purdy left so Tyke had nothing to do either so he left.  He said his goodbyes but again goodbyes aren't fun with a lot of people around.  If that doesn't make sense it's ok.  Cuz Tyke knows what he means and in this case that's all that matters.  Kinker was still there though so they went up to Macaroon's and got him and Tyronious and played some midnight bball at Cougar Ridge.  It was gay.  Wasn't fun and it was cold.  Oh well, can't win em all.  Then Tyke went home and got home remarkably quick.  He thinks he was going pretty fast on the freeway but just didn't notice it.  He wasn't really paying attention to be truthful.  He just kinda was floating home.  So there's the day.  Now for the rest.  Today came back something that hasn't been here for a while.  Since school really.  Maybe the week before the last week even.  But it hasn't been here all break.  And that is cuz Tyke hasn't been hanging out with any girl at all.  And you know what, that actually makes things better sadly.  Just because the girls he hangs out with don't have to give what Tyke wants to receive.  He can't get the kind of attention he really wants because of who it is he spends his time with.  And on nights like this Tyke is really in a position he doesn't want to be in.  Bowling was ok just because it was fun talking to Ekul and Purdy.  But it just isn't what Tyke wants.  He almost doesn't want to hang out with the girls on nights like this because he knows that afterwards he isn't going to be happy.  He never is.  It's a curse that truly does plague him.  His friendships are all cool and it is fun when he just gets to hang out with them but when it is just a bunch of his friends with their boyfriends, it gets to Tyke.  Maybe it doesn't "get to Tyke" but it just is not what he wants the situation.  And in reality, Tyke really doesn't think he feels how he feels now because of a particular girl.  It is just his situation.  He just really really hates being alone.  He is a very social person and he really wants his need to be filled.  The problem is the girls he chases can't fulfill his needs.  And now he realizes that and that has actually helped him.  His feelings toward people have changed in some respects just because of what it is he knows.  He is looking for certain qualities now in a girl.  And he really does know what it is.  That is something he has never known before.  He just has had a reaction to some girls but he didn't really know what it was.  Now he knows what he needs in a girl.  But of course, this doesn't solve the problem.  It doesn't make it worse but it is no aid to Tyke either.  But on nights like tonight where it is just a bunch of couples and Tyke it is far from his desire.  All of the little pecks and hugs and high fives and rubs are just too much.  Tyke sort of needs to distance himself from all of this.  He needs to just find something else that he needs to do or something to keep himself occupied.  His mind is always thinking about things and that makes it harder but he still knows what he needs to do.  The harder part is just acting on that and sticking to it.  All of this is somewhat repetitive and bland but it is the truth.  Tyke is simply looking for something he won't be able to find.  He just hates thinking about things and then he always compares himself to his peers and wonders why he isn't like that.  Or why he hasn't done anything like that in the past.  Why it was always other people doing everything while Tyke sat home alone with his parents watching a movie and eating popcorn.  He really wonders why it is he having this kind of situation when he thinks about how he is always such good friends with everyone.  He doesn't know of many people who truly don't like him and that bothers him in a way.  Because if there are so many people who say things to Tyke that he thinks mean something, then why is there nobody who has feelings for him?  Almost a paradox.  Not really but Tyke would like to think his situation is paradoxical.  So much there but nothing to come of it.  As is life.

      For being the worst day of break yet, this was quite a nice day.  It certainly wasn't a hoot and holler but it was at least a Hip Hip Hooray.  Actually maybe a little less than that.  Whatever that might be.  Tyke had to get up early (10AM) today for he was going to do some more of his "Community Experience" if you can call it that.  He left his house about 11 to go down to downtown Seattle and the plush KING5 studios.  It is really exhilirating knowing that you know the place and the people and they at least sort of know you and are at least familiar with you.  A great feeling to know that you are known at a place that is influential.  Anyways, he just hung out with his guy there for about 6 hours.  It was pretty boring actually today.  He just sat around and read some sports mags for a while and watched a little TV.  Then he learned how to edit some stuff and he gave his input on a few stories that are in progress.  Later on he watched some tapes of high school basketball games looking for a certain player and some achievements.  He learned how to use that equipment too.  All in all that was pretty cool.  But he didn't go down to Key Arena today.  On Saturday he might though.  Since the 'Nics have a game then, he is gonna go down to KING and probably go down to the Key.  So that should be cool.  Tyke went out to his car after leaving and saw that somebody had hit his left headlight thingy (not the headlight but the little turn signal thing to the left of it) and the plastic glass crap was broken off.  The light bulbs still work so it isn't a deal, just an aesthetic thing.  And Tyke's car isn't exactly a beauty anyway so he doesn't really care.  Well Tyke went to BK on the way home and sat in there and ate dinner by himself.  It was kind of weird eating dinner in a fast food restaurant by himself.  He rarely, if ever, does that anymore.  But tonight he did it.  And he did it well.  Then he went home and talked to his parents for a little while and then played some PS2 as he waited for Macaroon.  They played a little PS2 and then D-Cups came over so they played Shithead and 13.  Both were fun games.  And then BS which was cool cuz Tyke ended up not losing by cheating (in the rules cheating though) and winning.  It was great.  Then they played some games and Tyronious came over.  He brought some ice cream so they ate that.  Mmmm...ice cream.  Then they played some Soul Calibur and more PS2 and then they left.  And then Tyke blogged.  And then Tyke slept.  Oh wait, that is coming up next.  Stay tuned for the rest of the adventures after this short 24 hour break...

      The streak continues.  Two streaks in fact.  The first is of course the fact that Tyke blogs for the night.  The second though is the fact that Tyke had yet another great day.  Today started out at about 11:30 for Tyke.  He meandered around the house until he found what he liked.  PS2.  He played that for a while while talking online just a tidbit.  His mom came home at sometime and brought him some Taco Time.  So he had a very fine lunch.  Perfect amount of food this time cuz Tyke was hungry.  The meal is usually quite a lot of food.  It was very good.  Tyke then returned to play some more PS2 and later Tyronious called him up.  So he let him come on over and they played some games on the PS2 and then since it wasn't raining at the moment they went out to play some bball.  Tyke was his usual great FT self but he missed his 10th FT so he only got 9 in a row.  Pretty poor by his standards.  Oh well.  The rain came back when the two were shooting around so Tyke was just about to leave when it stopped so he went back and started shooting again and then it started up again.  So he once again was about to leave and it stopped.  Then he just said screw it and took a couple more shots and then left.  Then it started raining again.  They went back, played a few more games and then Tyronious left.  Tyke putzed around for a little while and he just remembered that Purdy called him earlier and they are going to hang out during/after the girls game on Friday so that is cool.  Cuz she will be back then.  So thats definitely cool.  Haven't seen her in a week.  Dotti is the same but she is gone the whole week.  That is sad.  Won't see her until school starts up.  And that is not going to be a good time.  Well, the rest of Tyke's day.  He called his mentor and is going down to KING again tomorrow at about 11 to just hang out with him for the day.  Probably not going anywhere and it will probably be pretty boring for Tyke just cuz he won't be watching anything.  It will just be sitting and watching TV semi-uncomfortably for about 8 hours maybe.  Who knows how long he'll stay?  It will all depend.  But he will rack up the hours and he only needs 10 more.  He has like 2 months to do so too.  He could go every day for like 10 minutes.  That is how much time he has left.  Not much.  Later on in the night Tyke was playing poker with Kinker and Tyronious online and they set up plans for their own card game at Kinker's house.  K-caj, D-Cups, and Macaroon were also additions to the crew.  Tyke was the big man at the table.  He ended up winning 14 bucks and his 5 he put in the pot.  So he came home with 19 bucks but went in with 5.  So it was a +14 profit.  Very nice.  That is 3 days of lunch right there.  Amazing.  But he knows that he isn't good.  He was just getting great cards for most of the night.  He knew what to play when and what to bet.  He isn't bad but he isn't like the super poker genius.  Just a solid player who isn't too hard to read but isn't easy to read either.  A straight shooter some could say.  He didn't bluff at all tonight either.  Didn't really need to actually.  But it was fun.  After poker the gang played some MOH and then Tyke came home.  Tyke needs some rest though cuz he has to go to Seattle at like 11.  But thats ok cuz it won't be bad.  Ok, have fun stopping now.  Stop.

      Today...was awesome.  Best day yet.  All in all it ruled.  And this was without the addition of girls even.  A remarkable day.  Wow.  Tyke had a blast.  So today was by far the best day of break.  And it started out great because Tyke got up at 10.  That's right.  Tyke set his alarm and got up at 10AM so as to enjoy his day.  And boy did he.  Starting off the day was watching some good old Price is Right.  A down right well-done show.  Tyke took a nice little shower, shaved a little (really not a big beard guy if you can't tell), and then he made himself look good with a nice mix and match of clothes.  Then he got on the phone and called Macaroon.  Now listen to this...nobody answered.  It was 10:34 when he called.  And nobody answered.  Well later on Tyke called up again and this time Macaroon answered and they planned out how they were going to meet.  And then Tyke told him that he called earlier and Macaroon was like, oh that was you? i thought somebody else was gonna get it.  So this time...Tyke woke up Macaroon!!!  HA!  Take that!  At like noon Tyke got up and went to the ATM and got some money, then he met up with Macaroon at GameStop in Issaquah where they both were going to buy a game.  Tyke got ESPN NBA Basketball and that is a great game.  They went up to Macaroon's to play the two games and that was fun.  Dr. Phil Lelee came up and joined them as well.  They got hungry and tried to exchange Macaroon's game back at GameStop so they headed down there again.  When getting there Tyke saw an old friend of his from high school going to the same place so they caught up on old times a little and that was fun.  Then the boys went to Costco and Tyke got a great Hand Dipped Super Premium Ice Cream Bar with Roasted Almonds.  While eating Tyke saw the same friend from high school come by.  So they talked some more and then parted ways yet again for Tyke's house.  They played Tyke's basketball game there.  It was tons of fun.  First it was Tyke as the Sonics (with Chris Landreth on the team) against the Lakers.  The Lakers are hella good in that game though and they managed to pull out the win.  It was a good game but unfairly matched.  Tyke still lost though.  After that they did 24/7 mode which is hella tight.  They did that for hours.  And didn't get tired at all as they just kept taking turns.  After that they played another game.  It was Tyke as the 76ers this time versus the other two as the Kings.  And wow, was Peja Stojakovic ever good.  Now that Doc P and Macaroon had the release point down they were just draining impossible 3's with Peja.  He scored 63 points to lead all scorers.  But Tyke just kept getting foul shots and made 39 of 45.  That is good.  He kept it close and had a 3 point lead with seconds left.  To make it short, Peja made an incredible 3 at the buzzer to send it to OT and there the Kings took it easily winning by 8.  A great game again though.  Then the guys left and Tyke had dinner and hung out.  At 7:30 he headed up to Macaroon's where they met before going bowling.  They played some Soul Calibur II before leaving and that was fun.  Then they went to Hillcrest Bowl.  It was Tyke, Macaroon, Kinker, Dr. Phil, and Fejj on one lane and the other had Dui, Maniak, Samantha, and Skippy.  Singles versus couples.  Tyronious and Trew-fanator later came and made their own lane.  But Tyke bowled a little above par the first game.  But boy did he ever find his touch the second game.  Wow, he left one open frame the whole game, the 2nd frame he believes.  And twice (3 times maybe??) he had 2 straight strikes needing a third for the turkey but instead got spares.  He was on fire.  He ended up with a grand total of...just try and guess.  It was incredible.  203!!!!!!  203!!!!!  That is sooo good.  97 away from perfect.  His best game ever by far.  It was just a stellar performance.  The high game of the day in fact.  It said on the screen with Tyke Turner in big print.  It was funny.  He owned with that game.  Then they did a 2 losers buy two winners ice cream at Dick's in Seattle.  The person in 3rd place doesn't have to pay at all.  It was a great game.  Came down to the wire for 3rd place but Dr. Phil squeaked it out.  Macaroon blew and had to buy Kinker ice cream and Fejj had a valiant effort but he ended up having to buy Tyke ice cream.  While at Dick's they met some very interesting people to say the least.  Two guys just kept beat-boxing (or whatever it is called).  They were weird.  Pretty good but weird.  And this friend of theirs thought they were insanely messed up.  Then of course there were the "working girls" there and the homeless and the sluts and the whores and the poor and the everything (Tyke didn't mean to be mean with the "sluts and whores" but come on...).  Tyke was not in his usual environment.  He kept flexing his right butt cheek to make sure his wallet was still there.  No joke.  Dui seemed to find that comical but it was still the best idea in that situation.  He didn't want to move it to the front for fear of someone seeing that and either get offended and beat him up or get intrigued and beat him up.  Either way he didn't want to get beat up.  So then he came home and wrote an email.  Then he came and blogged.  What a great day.  Great day.

       Break is moving pretty quickly.  Too quickly.  3 days of it have already come and gone.  Gotta take things slow now.  Like maybe get up before noon on Tuesday.  Tyke hopes to get up before 10.  But that might be a stretch.  Hopefully by 10 then.  Today he was awakened again by the call of Macaroon McGee and once again Macaroon was surprised by the fact that Tyke wasn't up yet.  Does it ever not surprise him??????  Well, Tyke quickly showered and got online and they planned out their doings for the day.  At 1:30 Tyke, Macaroon, and Maniak all met up at Costco and got a pizza to take back to Tyke's pad.  It was a very good pizza indeed.  Mmmm.  They ate it and listened to some music while talking about the daily gossip.  Ya know, guy stuff.  Then, since Maniak hadn't seen any of the videos they showed those and the splendor of those.  Then Maniak left but Tyke and Macaroon watched the most recent Talk Sex episode they made.  It was really quite good.  Perhaps the best yet.  But the first time Tyke watched Talking Sex he was cracking up.  The novelty of the idea is gone.  The questions are hard to come up with and the answers are just at par.  But nonetheless the most recent video was exquisite.  Randomness was the theme in this one.  It was quite funny.  Of course the usual Macaroon bashing is in there though.  Ha!  Good times.  Then they played some video games for a while and then Kinker came over.  They played more video games and hung out and then Skippy and Samantha came over.  They decided to play cards and they played quite a few different games.  From 5-Card Draw to Spit! to War to Ratscrew to Shithead.  Everything.  It was fun.  Until it was just cheating and that isn't fun.  Cheating isn't fun for Tyke anymore.  Unless it means it wins him money.  But then it is wrong so he doesn't do that.  So really cheating isn't fun.  Keep it PG.  Well, Tyke won a final game of Hold'Em and that meant he got to kick everyone out so he could have dinner.  Then he just sat around and watched TV for a while and just hung out.  He watched some of Real World/Road Rules Challenge:The Inferno.  Man, Kendal is soo hot.  Tyke still vividly remembers the time he and Skippy saw her at a Mariners game.  So hot.  So very hot.  Mmmmm...Tyke wants to meet her.  Not really but if he could he would.  Yeah, then he played some Empire Poker and talked with Macaroon on the phone about tomorrow and stuff like that.  And how he might get a new game and how Tyke wants to get ESPN NBA Basketball cuz that is sick.  Maybe he will tomorrow.  But he hates spending money.  He should sell some of the stuff he never uses.  Anybody wanna buy some games or something from Tyke???  If you see something you like make an offer.  He's going out of business.  It's a liquidation extravaganza!!!  EDIT: Bambi is one of the toughest mofos ever.  Here's why: he has his mother get shot and has to go grow up with some old guy who he doesn't really know and probably questions if it is his father or not but he never knows.  Then he comes back and sees his old pals Thumper and Flower (who is almost definitely gay by the way).  But the two pals become twitterpated with new chicks and find themselves to be more inclined to hang out with them than Bambi (been there seen that).  Well then he has to fight this guy who he doesn't know over his woman Faline cuz the guy was most likely going to rape her.  So he gets taken in the first couple rounds but then comes back strong and takes it to him knocking him out in the last round.  But that's not all.  Later on he is taking a nice snooze and finds out there is a massive fire taking down the forest.  So he rushes to find Faline but can't and she is off alone somewhere.  He finally finds her in the midst of a total handicap match with like 20 rabid dogs.  He single-handedly takes them all out and this is without fully grown antlers too.  He only has some temps in before the real things come in full.  But then as he tries to get away some fucker shoots him but doesn't come finish the job.  So he is left to sit in miserable agony while he ponders whether he will ever see his girl again or if he will even survive the night.  Well then his dad/unknown guy comes in and tells him he has to leave.  But he was just shot!!!  Somehow he manages to get up and run from this devastating fire that seems to have a mind of its own.  It is just following these two deer as they try to flee, not a very nice fire.  But then he manages to flee and get back to his woman.  Then he knocks her up and they mistakably have twins so he decides to flee and becomes the Prince of the Forest so he doesn't have to worry about those little twirps.  Definitely the decision everyone would make if faced with it.  So there, that is why Bambi is a P-I-M-P.  Oh yeah, Tyke watched Bambi tonight...

      Totally Tyke indeed!!!  Today totally towered to touch the top tier!!!  Truth touches this talk!  That was a lot of alliteration.  Too much.  Today was not too much.  It was just the right amount.  Tyke and Goldilocks have had the same experiences.  Except Tyke hasn't really had too much of anything over a break.  Too little of something but not too much.  He has hung out with people just the right amount.  Today was another example of that.  Tyke got up around noon.  A great time to wake up by the way.  Later on he took a shower.  Much later on.  Like 12:30.  Yeesh!  Then he putzed around for a lot of the day.  But having fun all the while.  He was so not bored that he felt it would be kinda cool to actually start reading the thing he is supposed to read for English over break.  Yeah, he almost read the first couple of lines in it.  Almost, then he got tired of trying to be a non-procrastinator (anticrastinator???).  He played some games and hung out in his downstairs for much of the day watching TV.  He watched some of the All-Star game.  It was pretty good.  Some sick plays as usual.  And a bunch of stupid stuff as usual.  After his dinner Tyke and Macaroon decided that they would hang out.  So Macaroon came over.  They watched some TV and then Kinker came over.  They all watched the all-star game, the Simpsons, and listened to music.  All at the same time.  It was fun.  Then they started playing MOH and they were good.  As usual.  They took out some Oomomos this time instead of the usual Bromleys.  Still a grand affair.  Later on Tyronius came over and brought with him a really good ice cream cake.  It was really good.  Mmmmm.  Tyke, Macaroon, and Kinker all took their hits at it at the same time and it probably looked pretty homosexual as they did it but they didn't care.  They split it up into "equal" portions but since Macaroon got the short end of the cake he started burrowing into Tyke's part cuz he got the most.  A clever cajun that man.  But Tyke still ate his fair share and it was stellar.  Tyronius did a good job of bringing that over from work, for free.  The gang continued to play MOH and then Fejj came over and joined in the fray.  That meant that one player would be sitting out at times.  That created some more competition and the bazooka levels were really a matter of not killing yourself (good advice in any situation really).  After that they played NBA2K3.  They owned as the Sonics and then played each other.  It was Tyke and Kinker as the 50s/60s Legends versus Tyronius, Macaroon, and Fejj as the Orlando Magic.  Needless to say the Legends won.  Bob Cousy had an off night but he still scored 28.  And Strom Thurmond and Don Baylor had very solid performances.  Even the Amed and K-Caj style of play by Bob Petit was solid enough to earn him a double-double.  All in all a good game.  Macaroon and Fejj left after that.  So Tyke, Kinker, and Tyronius played cards.  They played hold'em of course and that was fun.  Then they made their own variation on that game and that was very interesting.  The card games they make up are really quite great.  Quite great indeed.  This break has gotten off to a great start.  Let's keep the days rolling well.

      Saturday was swell.  It may not have started out with a big bang but it was just a day full of events.  Awesomeness at its peak.  Not peak exactly but fun nonetheless.  Tyke was awoken by Macaroon at 11:30 by his phone call.  Macaroon seemed surprised that he was still asleep even though Tyke told him repeatedly yesterday that he would be sleeping til then at least.  Tyke got up after a little bit and took a shower.  Then he went over and picked up the phone and called up Macaroon.  So they got together at his house.  Dr. Phil and Kinker, and Tyronius all joined up too.  Maniak even came over.  They played a little Halo and then left for Cougar Ridge.  Tyke was not on his dominating game.  He couldn't totally use his size advantage as he didn't really have one but that certainly wasn't an excuse.  On one of the first shots Tyke went up for a rebound and got his right ring finger jammed.  Then a shot later or two he had the same thing happen to the same finger.  So it was really hurting.  He took it easy for a little while after that.  Later on he was playing defense and he took an elbow to the left temple from Maniak.  That made him a little dizzy.  So he got a wee bit banged up during the game.  The way he wrote it in the blog sounds worse than it really was though.  It wasn't like he had to sit out or anything.  His body just hurt some.  But it was still fun.  Even if his finger now has an hourglass figure to it.  After that they hung out for a while longer and then went back to Macaroon's.  That was cool.  They played Halo and cards and danced and had a jolly time.  Tyke, Kinker, and Dr. Phil went out to dinner at Burger King and then came back to the house to pick up the rest of the gang on their way to the girls basketball game.  It was a fun game.  The girls won of course and Tyke really enjoyed the atmosphere.  They beat Sly Lion so that was just an added bonus.  After the game Tyke went with the crew back to Macaroon's and then to Cougar Ridge for some midnight bball.  Then they headed off to Dr. Phil's for some more fun.  They played Halo and just hung out until they left.  It was a really fun day but Tyke doesn't really feel like blogging.  But he did text both Dotti and Purdy and since they are both gone he can't see them so that was pleasurable.  Well, short blog, short day.  Or at least it felt short.  Sunday is coming up.  Actually it's here.

      Fortunately or unfortunately Tyke is going to make this a short little blog tonight.  For it is almost 1 on Saturday morning and he wants to sleep.  Poker took longer than expected so that is the reason.  He will try and make it more interesting starting Saturday, or at least Sunday.  The day was a pretty simple breeze.  Nothing that was challenging for almost the entire day.  Which is a total relief cuz Tyke really didn't want to do anything.  Tyke had a sub 1st period which allowed him to just "do" his AP Gov homework but really he just made up some of the randomest crazy-ass bullshit ever.  It was pretty funny.  Just so you know, the President is no longer the top man in his own organization chart :).  Tyke got to play basketball second period.  He couldn't really shoot as it was a tough little surface to play on cuz they were in the upper gym.  And it was tough to drive cuz he just got mutilated with hacks and elbows while driving so he would end up just forcing the shot but since there weren't fouls he just would end up putting up a poor shot.  Tyke was teamed with the best player on the basketball team and at the least Tyke showed him that Tyke was not to be taken lightly.  He can ball with the best of em.  His defense was great.  A few steals go a long way for the team.  Long enough to get the win.  Tyke hit a few outside shots and had some nice lay-ins.  All in all, he proved his worth.  3rd period involved talking randomly and watching the West Wing so as to "learn."  4th period though, what a hell hole this is becoming.  Mrs. Dyke-Bitch is giving hella work and quizzes all of a sudden.  And she probably thinks that this is preparing the class for the AP test.  But it sure as hell ain't.  Taking quizzes on words that the students simply memorize for one quiz and write silly poems in groups and do some homework that has no relevance to general concepts really isn't doing jack for them.  It almost makes them dumber.  Tyke has probably gotten dumber this year.  His blog is the only thing he writes in.  He certainly doesn't do writing things for English.  And Tyke has only had to write 2 or 3 essays all year in Gov with only 1 of them being graded.  That is just stupid if you really want to get prepped.  You need to get a lot of practice to do well.  Like last year.  That preparation paid off (not really in Lit it turned out).  But all in all, this year is a total blow off.  It is quite comical the effort Tyke puts in.  In all of his classes.  He slacks more than the stoners who barely come to class.  Maybe not more, but seemingly on par with them.  After the majority of the day Tyke went out to lunch at Pie but he got screwed.  He ran to try and beat these three kids that were about to walk in and he almost made it.  He sprinted hard but couldn't quite get around them.  So they ended up taking all of the good pieces and Tyke would have had to wait a hella long time for a piece so he just got the runt of the litter.  It was pretty poor.  Mediocre really.  But it still did a good enough job.  Actually, Tyke is hungry now.  Mmmm...Snickers bar.  That would be nice now.  Ooooo...or a huge slice of pumpkin pie with whipped cream.  No no.  Just the whipped cream.  A full can of whipped cream.  That tastes so good if you haven't ever just flipped it upside down and just started spraying it directly into your mouth.  Cut out the middle man and you get what you really want.  It is damn good.  Ok, 6th period.  It was fun.  The last day of the student teacher teaching which is kinda too bad cuz she became fun.  They hardly ever had a bad period when she was teaching.  Tyke read from the Physics book aloud again.  His accents are just random.  Random, random, random.  Pretty much you could sum up Tyke Translucent Turner in one word.  Random.  After school Tyke joined up with Macaroon and Fejj at Amed's house and they played some bball.  It was fun and Tyke owned the first game of 21.  Then he stopped playing and Amed won.  But Tyke jammed his fingers during the first game of Tyke-Macaroon versus Amed-Fejj.  Tyke and Macaroon schooled.  Tyke just kept hitting 2 bombs from everywhere with anyone on him.  It was sick.  And Macaroon would chip in a point or two occasionally too.  They won the first 3 games and then started missing the 2s so they had to kinda fight back but lost.  And apparently, that game was the championship or the important game or something.  Yeahhhh, suuuuure.  After Tyke's pizza dinner and such Macaroon, Tyronious, Amed, and Kinker all came over.  They played ESPN, MOH, and poker.  Tyke got 2nd!!!!  He outlasted everyone but Kinker who won the entire pot.  But Tyke still played longer than anyone else but Kinker.  Oh yeah, Tyke bought in 5 times.  So he lost 10 bucks.  Oh well, he was up 33 from before.  So that is fine.  He will win it back next time.  He was playing stupid anyway.  Amed is a funny player though.  He just makes it so much different.  He adds a whole new element.  So does Macaroon.  But we won't talk about that :(.  So then it became late and Tyke blogged.  And the cow jumped over the moon.  Night.  (Go Dotti!)

      The week keeps on droning on.  And actually it is going by pretty quick.  Quite a surprise to Tyke as he expected it to be slow and really boring because it is the first week back from break.  But he was wrong.  And Thursday didn't suck as much as expected either.  It started off marvelous cuz Tyke got to drive the Avalon.  Man, that lady is fiiiine.  She gets up and goes before you even notice it.  And it is amazing how smooth she is.  You don't even know when she is accelerating and shifting.  Oh, and the sound system is sick.  But Tyke thinks that almost all new cars are like that.  1st period was a little bit boring today.  Tyke thinks tomorrow should be fun though cuz the regular teacher won't be there but there is apparently like a different math teacher from the school coming in to teach so it won't quite be a substitute environment.  But better than normal.  2nd period was a lax day cuz it was power cleans day.  And 3rd period wasn't too bad.  Tyke had to lead discussion about an article but he actually read the one that he discussed so that made it ok.  4th period involved talking about weird stuff and doing round robin poems with Dr. Phile and Amed.  Except the poems weren't that good.  But they were funny.  Lunch was good.  Mainly cuz of the vehicle.  It was so great.  They went to JIB and Tyke got a really good Creamy Caramel Shake.  Mmmm...creamy caramel.  The rest of the day was pretty good.  5th period was its usual gay self.  But 6th period was fun.  Tyke and Purdy sorta did the lab well.  It got done at least.  And Tyke doesn't have to copy the physics problems tomorrow cuz they aren't due until Monday so he gets a nice little reprieve.  Tyke hasn't done anything after school this week so he continued that tradition but he did play more ESPN and burned Purdy a copy of his latest mix.  And he didn't do any homework of course.  He did unzip his backpack but he realized he wasn't going to do any work so he just zipped it back up.  That was the extent of his homework completion.  Unfortunately Tyke doesn't think that he is going to get to drive the Avalon to school tomorrow but there is still a slight chance.  Thats ok though.  Cuz it will be Friday.  And good things happen on Friday.  You know what Tyke's talking about.  ;).  Too bad that it isn't true.  Wait, what is Tyke talking about.  He was trying to make it sound like he was hanging out with a girl friend (girl friend not girlfriend) but then it went too far.  So it just failed.  Man, blogging is getting hard.  Partially cuz Tyke just thinks that everything he writes is boring.  Like, there isn't much variety to this.  And it takes time to write.  For a while it was the novelty of the blog that kept it going and the dedication to it.  Then it was the hurt and longing feeling that Tyke had for seemingly ever that was the topic.  Then there was that little stretch there.  Then it was a totally new life.  Then it was just interesting things happening.  And some break stuff was interesting.  But lately it just doesn't have that same flair to Tyke.  He could be wrong.  It only matters what his constituency thinks.  That's you.

      Today sucked ass.  Boy is that ever a change from the past two days intros???  But it is also a lie.  Cuz today didn't suck ass.  It was ok.  The past few Wednesdays at school haven't really been that great.  They're still within the top two in best days of the week though.  The beauty with Wednesdays is there is hardly ever enough time in each class for it to be miserable.  Not even English and the eternal quiz.  That quiz was loooong and dumb.  But don't let Tyke get ahead of himself.  Math was fine today.  Tyke got tired of having to do his homework at home (doing=making up funny things to say that vaguely resemble a legitimate answer) so he buckled down and managed to do it in class (do=same as previous).  Then it was off to 2nd period.  And it was cardio day so that meant 8 minute abs.  An easy breeze as usual.  Tyke works his abs much better at home than in 8 minute abs.  Maybe he doesn't do them as well in school.  In any case, it was easy.  But then they had to run 2 laps so that wasn't much fun but it was warm and windy out so it was pleasant.  3rd period was just a couple of fire lanes that Tyke didn't participate in but it was somewhat enjoyable to watch.  Then came the gay quiz in English.  It was long and Tyke just made up funny answers (similar to how he does his math homework).  But he still managed to tie Amed so he must be smart.  HA!  Yeah, right.  Just over 25% isn't good, is it?  But then came lunch so that was good.  McDonald's seemed deserted.  There was hardly anyone in there.  Dr. Phil got interested in the nutrition facts so he went and picked em up.  And they found out how unhealthily they were eating.  Tyke had about 55 grams of fat with his meal.  Amed had 33.  Haha.  And Amed thought the chicken wasn't too bad.  Or maybe he didn't, if he didn't then sorry.  5th period is just boring.  Tyke doesn't ever feel like working on his city drawing so he just sits there and erases lines and just doesn't really do anything at all.  6th period was fun though.  Tyke actually wants the student teacher lady to keep teaching.  She is fun now.  She doesn't act like she is really smart.  And the class just talks a lot when she is teaching so it is just a fun environment.  And tomorrow Tyke and Purdy have a lab to do so that will be fun.  After school Tyke came home and watched a little Full House while eating and then played ESPN.  His baller is getting better still but the 1 on 1 has gotten harder.  Yao was really hard to beat.  It was a 21-19 win for Tyke and his baller, "Chris Landreth."  And Tyke wins 21-0 quite frequently so it was really close.  It is harder to drain the 3 bombs with a 7'5" man in front of you.  Believe you him.  Tyke's teammate for the 2 on 2 matches is Sam Cassell who is ok on defense but he is a retard.  He can't ever do anything right.  And he blows at rebounding.  He couldn't even jump if there was an alligator 1 foot away from him that was about to eat him and the only way he could survive is by jumping 4".  He would get eating.  Such a dumbass.  But Tyke still wins.  After that Tyke talked online a little and then ate dinner.  It was tortellini with a sauce that was good, but only in moderation.  Some things are like that.  Like Tyke takes a little test bite and really likes it so he has more of it next time.  But then it doesn't taste as good.  Or bad even.  This sauce was an example of that.  So he had some doses of it sparingly.  "You drove home real quick.  Did you make it in time to masturbate?"  Name the song.  Win a prize.  Oh yeah, before Tyke forgets again he forgot to tell you something yesterday.  When he got home and checked the mail he found out he had made $14.  A long while back Tyke's pop told him about a CD settlement where if you had bought a CD in Washington within the last 5 years or so you would be entitled to an undisclosed amount of money.  So Tyke filled out a little form and ta da!  Tyke found a check from Attorney General Christine Gregoir for $13.86.  His dad just decided to cash the check for him and then gave him an even $14.  So he made a cool $14 just for walking 30 feet and getting the mail.  A nice little bonus.  But back to tonight.  Tyke ate dinner and then listened to some music and watched Newlyweds and Death Do Us Part.  Newlyweds is fun.  Jessica Simpson is just so hot.  And Nick Lachey seems like a cool guy.  But not in a gay way.  Then Tyke...oh wait that is really all he did.  Oh yeah, he watched this thing on the Discovery channel about the assasination of JFK.  It was pretty interesting.  Too bad they don't know for sure how it happened and who did it.  But then it wouldn't be a mystery.  On the show they showed the full footage of the assasination though.  Tyke had never seen it fully.  Wow, it really was the murder of a human being.  For some reason Tyke always thought that assasinations weren't gruesome or never really imagined it.  But it was.  The footage actually shows his head exploding.  That sniper bullet did its damage indeed.  It was, totally wrong word here, almost cool.  But only in the dark sense of the word and just because it is totally real and gruesome.  But enough about exploding dead guys.  Hope you have a dreamy night where the Care Bears, Muppet Babies, and Berenstein Bears invade your dreams and have a tea party on a cloud.  And Amelia Earhart is invited too.  But she can only stay for an hour cuz she has to fly to Puerto Rico to meet up with Caligula.

      Tuesday nights rule!  Today was another pretty darned good day overall.  1st period was great.  They had a sub so right when Tyke walked to the classroom he decided to go back to his car and pick up a deck of cards.  So they started playing that but the sub was really against them doing so.  So they put up a bunch of folders as a little protection.  That didn't work too well but she didn't bother them for a while.  Then when she came back around they did some card tricks and then she started talking about how UW is cheaper than WSU (which is a lie) and then just kept blabbing on.  How come substitutes generally talk a lot?  Like about random shit?  The kids never care really.  Oh well, it is 98% of the time better to have a substitute than the real thing.  After cards they started drawing pictures.  Man those things were funny.  Tyke was laughing non-stop hard for at least half of the period.  It was a great start to the day.  But now Tyke will have to do his math hw after he blogs.  Shouldn't be too bad though.  2nd period was not worth mentioning.  3rd period hardly involved anything blogworthy but it had its ups.  Not many downs in the period.  Other than the fact that Dotti wasn't there.  That class can really be fun though.  4th period, another class that can really be fun but seldom is.  Today wasn't too bad.  No quizzes or anything like that so obviously it can't be too bad.  But there is a quiz tomorrow and that one won't be fun.  Tyke and Purdy passed some notes and wrote a "round robin" poem.  They just wrote a line and then passed it on to the other person.  It sucked.  Tyke wanted it to be semi-serious but when you start out with "Buxom chest bouncing in the breeze" you aren't going to get a very serious poem.  Mainly it was just a time filler until lunch.  Tyke and the crew piled up in White Lightning and bumped to BCL's Celebration of Black History Month while cruising on down to Subway.  It was really a great lunch.  That sandwich is soooo good.  After leaving Subway Tyke took a fantastic route.  He was coming back and saw a car in the right lane at a red light that wasn't turning right.  So Tyke put on the brakes and cut into the Ross parking lot and took a shortcut there.  Damn, that was a great read.  Then he cut in front of some cars and managed to hit the left turn green light on Newport Way.  He is just a great navigator.  Except for when he was going to park at Dick's.  Minor screw up in the turning on that one.  But he was the first one to see it in the first place.  So it balances out.  5th period is really one of Tyke's two most boring classes.  He just hardly gets to talk at all and he only has one person to talk to anyway and thats Macaroon.  And talking to Macaroon is like talking to a girl.  Oh wait, no that's getting blocked by Macaroon is like getting blocked by a girl.  Or at least that is what Tyke likens it to.  6th period was adequate enough to not be deemed bad.  In other words, it was ok.  A little quizzy wizzy in there which Tyke probably did poorly on but he doesn't care.  School now is all about having fun in class.  That is really all he cares about.  He is doing some of the homework but only what he wants to do.  So yeah, he's really gearing himself up for college!  After school Tyke came home and ate a little bit and got ready for his dentist appointment.  Because he takes care of himself, he had no problems with his teeth, as you all are probably dying to know.  He is going to have to have his wisdom teeth out though.  This summer in fact.  Probably mid-July to early August.  Or somewhere between getting back from Europe and going to college.  His summer break really isn't going to be that long.  School starts up August 23rd for him.  Yep, that is early.  A day before his 18th birthday in fact.  So he will be illegal when he heads off to college.  He'll be illegal for a while.  Only once school starts will he become legal.  Let's say legal one more time.  Legal.  Speaking of legal, 16 more days.  15 probably by the time you read this.  It's fun to do countdowns.  That's why he's doing this one.  Or at least he says the number of days a lot.  Upon coming home from the dentist he talked with his mom a lot.  They carpooled as his mom wanted to do some shopping and the area and that way traffic wouldn't be too bad because they could bypass it.  But they talked about like college and stuff.  Then they started talking about drinking and all of that stuff.  And what Tyke wanted to see in Europe and about going and drinking in the pubs there and just a bunch of stuff.  It was pretty fun actually.  Then they talked about his mom's stupid experiences in college and just weird stuff.  But it was cool.  So then Tyke came home and ate Chinese food which was really good and hung out for the night.  He hasn't talked to anyone online today in fact.  Probably because he is signed off.  That could do it.  But now Tyke is going to do his only homework he wants to, math.  And then go to bed.  And hopefully get about 9 and a half hours of sleep.  That would be nice.  Fuck what I said, it don't mean shit now.  Fuck the presents might as well throw em out.

      So school is back in session.  And so far, it isn't that bad.  Today was even a pretty good day.  Pleasant at most times.  And absolutely no need to do any homework at night so it was pretty much perfect.  1st period was fine.  Tyke made it fun as usual.  And he got loaded up with tickets.  Loaded.  2nd period was cool cuz it was legs day.  Legs day is the only day in which Tyke is the strongest in his group.  So he just goes around and does pretty much every leg exercise and it is fun.  Especially calf raises.  If he had a little calf-raise machine at home he would use it all the time.  Cuz he loves working the old calfs.  It makes him jump higher ya know.  Which means getting closer to dunking.  That is his most immediate goal in life.  To be able to dunk.  Somewhat lofty for a 5'11" white boy.  But he is pretty skinny and has semi-strong legs.  But it was funny today cuz for 5x4x3x2x1 he was doing squats and it came to 2 reps and he just decided to do 175.  And the first rep was a little challenging and then the second one was pretty hard but then he got to 1 rep and put on 185.  And he did that really easily.  Like he felt like he could add 30 pounds and still do it just as easily.  Which is kind of odd but whatever.  You probably don't care about any of Tyke's weight training stories though.  So he will digress.  3rd period.  Interesting little period.  Some more pauses in lecture because the class "was talking" and all this other stupid shit like how everyone "needs to memorize" this and that.  Bullshit.  Nobody needs to ever know all this crap.  Most of it, probably.  But all of it?  Hell no.  And nobody cares either.  Other than a few people.  Tyke isn't totally decided about taking that AP test either.  He has hardly payed attention all year so he is at a bit of a disadvantage and it would just be a waste of his parents money.  Even though he would most likely get at least a 3.  He knows he ain't taking the AP English test.  That will be a bitch.  And Tyke won't be able to say ain't or won't in it and those are two of the greatest words ever.  Mainly ain't.  It ain't no thang.  4th period involved a really gay quiz.  This was flaming.  Really badly done.  Stupid Oedipus.  Tyke even read you.  Mostly.  Somewhat.  Well, he read the majority at least.  Lunch was fun and they went to Pie.  No cheese there so Tyke had to get pep.  It just isn't as good as plain cheese.  Loaded up with the peppers though.  No parmesan like Dr. Phil though.  Damn man.  Doc P just eats like double the cheese with all of the cheese he adds to the pizza.  Crazy man.  But wise beyond his years.  Sorta.  Enough though.  5th period was boring but thats ok.  It doesn't matter.  Cuz 6th period was fun.  Tyke and Kinker made up some good Laker/dynasty analogies to their situation with the Sly Lioners.  They are Shaq and Kobe.  Of course Tyke is Shaq because of his inside dominance (no, really that is who he is in this scenario) and Kinker is Kobe because of his domination (at times) of the outside and dribbling skills and all that.  Oh, and the raping.  Just kidding.  Kinker ain't a rapist.  At least convicted...But after school Tyke smelled Purdy's car and it stinks.  Nice transition huh ;-)  Yeah, Tyke was in it the week before break and he mentioned it stankonia'd and then it just got magnanimously worse  because it didn't get cleaned.  So now it smells identical (you can have identical smells right??) to Tyke's garbage when there is a lot of rotten food in it.  That is just gross.  How can she handle the stench of ewwww?  Must not be human.  Could she be a cyborg???  That was a bit of an inside joke for all of you who didn't know.  Not just a blank reference to cyborgs.  After the sniffing Tyke went home and watched some tv and ate some food and then he went upstairs and decided to dl some music.  He just kept dling and made a new CD.  It is titled "BCL's Celebration of Black History Month."  Kind of ironic seeing as only 7 songs are by a group that has any "Afro-American" (another inside joke) in them.  Oh man, this was a fun blog.  Tyke has to end while he is ahead though.  Sew maybe he should leaf.  Amed is weird.  But funny.  Tyke wanted to say that earlier but he had no place so it obviously fits in here at the end.  Man, Tyke blogs a lot.  Yeesh, what a stud.

      So here it is.  The final day.  The final night.  The final blog.  Only one more break after this.  But you know what they say...after mid-winter break the time flies by.  Someone probably has said that at least.  Hopefully it is true in this case.  So today was a total change from every other day of break.  Nothing at all like his various escapades of the past week.  He went outside his house once the entire day.  And that was to check the brake fluid in his car, which was fine by the way.   But Tyke is getting ahead of himself.  He has to go through his day in order.  He got up at 10 and this is where it got kinda slow.  He really didn't want to wake up.  He just wanted to keep sleeping but he knew he shouldn't cuz he will already have enough problems trying to fall asleep tonight.  So he turned on the tv to try and keep him awake.  Well, it worked but barely.  He just closed his eyes and curled up a little bit and stayed really warm and totally comfortable.  He actually managed to stay like that, on the verge of sleeping, for an hour.  And then he finally got up because his dad had made pancakes.  But after eating the pancakes he went back downstairs and showered.  That was a nice shower.  Last one of break.  So Tyke watched TV for just about the entire day.  The big tv was on for really about 12 hours.  Tyke watched the Celebrity Mole marathon that was on.  The first season of that show was really good.  Then the rest haven't been as good but they are still definitely entertaining.  Nobody really watches that show other than Tyke though.  Or at least whenever Tyke has brought it up nobody has said they liked it.  But thats ok.  Tyke really loved just looking outside today and opening (but not going outside) the downstairs door.  It was really nice out and it smelled great.  It smelled...fresssshhhhh.  And it was pretty warm too.  A tiny breeze as well.  Just a great combination.  Well, Tyke wasn't really feeling like talking to people online for almost the entire day.  So people would message him but he didn't really feel like talking.  So he didn't.  So that is why.  And he didn't really want to hang out either.  At least with guys.  But really, he didn't want to hang out at all.  Instead, he took his merry time doing his homework for the whole day and of course hardly did any of it.  Just a little government and he read this one thing for english but didn't do the questions, which are probably more important anyway.  But the reading was easy so he skimmed through that.  And he already read the play in 9th grade so it was just a refresher.  He watched quite a bit of basketball today too.  And of course he shot around downstairs.  He has to keep himself primed for the next time the Sly Lioners want another game.  And they probably will sometime soon.  Tyke and Kinker should find another 3rd for that game.  That would make it interesting.  Three different players, three consecutive wins.  It would be like a great dynasty.  Keeping a great core of players around for years and just interspersing the rest to keep a balance.  That is how it has to be done.  Well, that is pretty much all of today's happenings.  Other than discussions had online later at night.  Tyke talked pretty much only with Dr. Phil and Amed.  But those were the good conversations.  Tyke and Dr. Phil Lelee have some really good talks.  Almost exclusively about girls and Tyke's situations but they are very informative.  Tyke learns something about himself almost everytime.  Like why he is feeling empty.  And about projecting feelings onto someone.  And just subjects that are constantly flooding Tyke's mind but he doesn't really think about them in a way that solves anything.  Not that Dr. Phil really solves Tyke's problems but he assuages the "crisis" a little.  It makes it easier to bear and makes Tyke more aware of everything.  Basically, it soothes Tyke.  Which is a really good feeling.  And Tyke's talks with Amed are just wacky.  They are just really entertaining.  They are deep and shallow at the same time.  But now it is getting a little late.  So Tyke is heading off to do other things.

      Stupid computer.  Now Tyke has to retype everything.  Ok, here it goes.  Hello.  There isn't much to say about today.  So it will be a pretty short recap of the day, hopefully.  Cuz there is no need to ramble on idiocies.  Oh wait, that is what this blog is based upon.  Oh well.  Today started off nicely.  The faint light of the sun shone through Tyke's curtains and illuminated the pale green hue of his walls.  It was picturesque.  Then he realized that the sun was shining in his eye and it hurt.  But it was still nice.  He got up and had nothing to do so he decided to pick out his outfit for his final job shadow needed.  Yep, the 6th time going out to KING got him his 30th hour completed.  That is a lot of time.  He needed to look semi-nice so he found something good.  Then he just hung out at his house for a while.  He went upstairs to the top floor where he has hardly been all week.  It was different since the last time even.  His mom had painted the guest bathroom.  It is a little bit paler than the color of his room but similar.  It looks nice though.  Painting actually does a lot to a room.  Tyke has been shocked by that fact.  His old house was hardly painted at all.  This new one is getting painted all over.  But at about 3 he left for Seattle and KING.  He went to Mickey D's on the way and got a great Reese's McFlurry.  That is easily the best flavor.  Damian Easley.  He got to the station at like 3:15 and called up his guy who was coming back from his house cuz he forgot his jacket.  He said he'd be back in like 5 minutes and would just pick up Tyke in the front of the station.  So Tyke waited outside the lobby on the bench.  Time started to pass and Tyke began to recognize some of the cars driving by.  He saw the same bus drive by at least 3 times.  Maybe more.  Time ticked to about 3:45 and Tyke began to wonder if he should call his guy.  For some reason he didn't and just played games on his cell phone.  Then time flew and it became 4:10.  At this point he really thought he should call his guy but he waited until 4:20.  It was such a nice day out and it wasn't cold so it wasn't like he was uncomfortable.  He called his guy though and he came down and picked him up.  He felt really bad about forgetting him but it showed Tyke's patience and dedication.  Sorta dedication.  But Tyke can be dedicated, that is the point.  He got up and watched the Zags game and just kept an eye out for important details or plays or anything.  There wasn't really anything in it so he just became a stat checker and fact looker-upper.  It was alright.  Then he went down and watched the 5 o'clock broadcast from the studio.  He has seen so many broadcasts it is nothing interesting now.  Almost bland.  Yeah, he is a vet down there.  After that they went back up and worked on the 6:30 show.  They got on the topic of pies though and had a long discussion about that.  Tyke loves both pumpkin and peanut butter pies.  Mmmm...whipped cream.  Last time Tyke was writing here he talked about a bunch of things but he doesn't want to go into that again.  Oh well, it was just about food.  Well, after that they hung out for a while and then Tyke left at about 7.  He had a nice ride home and just sat and sang and thought about stuff.  You know what about.  But nobody in particular.  Just generalities.  He got home and went downstairs and watched some tv.  Castaway was on and that is a really good movie so Tyke watched it.  How much would that suck to be in that situation?  Tyke would be extremely depressed.  He might not make it.  But Tyke mainly thought about what he would be missing.  Just that longing feeling he would always have.  If he thought that it was bad to long now it would be horrible by himself on an island.  But you know what, Tyke isn't going to talk anymore about that.  His first blog attempt was mainly based upon that but now he is tired of talking.  So he will just let you all think of what Tyke would say.  You pretty much know what he would talk about it anyway.  So it isn't a new thing.  All repetitive stuff anyway.  So goodnight.  Or goodbye if you read this on Sunday which it is now.  Damn, Sunday.  Stupid school.

      If you would like to understand pretty well how Tyke's night was just see what the weather is like outside as Tyke blogs.  It is mostly clear with faint clouds drifting across the horizon.  The dramatically calm moon piercing the eyes with its metallic whiteness.  A cool crisp air serenely penetrating the warmth and comfort of Tyke's jacket and lingering body heat of Dotti from their late-night cuddlefest.  It was most beautiful.  Tyke felt very at peace and zen-like.  Now to find out why.  The school day was pleasantly easy.  Nothing blogworthy for the first two periods other than there are a bunch of retarded people in Tyke's weight training class.  People are just so stupid sometimes.  So dumb.  Gov was bitchy again.  At least the teacher was.  Ever since the homework incident she has taken over the title Mrs. Dyke-Bitch from Tyke's english teacher.  She is just old and senile and doesn't know who says what and where they said it and is only concerned with sex and horses (and it is unknown whether or not she combines her fancies. ewww).  Lunch was a little above par although the company was 2 strokes below par as Dotti and Purdy were at Pie too.  In 6th period Tyke began his funniness.  Without telling the whole story this little anecdote won't be very funny.  And actually since Tyke isn't going to tell the whole story it still won't be funny.  Except to Purdy because she laughed the hardest of everyone (the cackle came out in fact as Kinker poignantly pointed out).  But basically it came to Purdy saying "I have pants from M.I.T. (the university btw)" and then Tyke ended up saying the joke "What kind of pants do people who go to M.I.T. wear? SMARTYpants!!!"  And it was funny.  Tyke liked it a lot.  He was proud of himself.  He tried to hide his hubris and just play it off but inside he was just patting himself on the back like there was no next Thursday.  After school Tyke went home and played ESPN from 3:30-6.  Then he played poker with Kinker online and he won $23,000.  He was on fire.  And just kept on getting the cards.  It was great.  Tyke made himself a pizza for dinner and it was pretty good but it was piping hot so it was tough to eat comfortably.  Ya'll know what that's like though.  Tyke went over to Purdy's about 8.  Mandy and Tig'Ol/Lisa Lovey were already upstairs with Purdy in her bedroom so Tyke joined for a little while until Dotti came.  Then they went downstairs and a bunch more people showed up later.  Just to name a few...Amed, Macaroon, Tina, Frederique, Ekul, Kramm, Beaner, and others that Tyke hopes he isn't forgetting but he is euphoric right now so it is tough to think of everything exactly like he wants to.  But all those people as well as the ones aforementioned.  All crew that Tyke knows.  All but one he has talked to on multiple occasions.  So Purdy's was great.  Tyke talked a lot to a bunch of people, ran on the treadmill, played ping pong, snuggled up, and just talked.  And there were no residual feelings to anyone at anytime, including now.  Which you probably have no idea how good that feels to Tyke.  But so as not to get into depth Tyke will continue.  Just hanging out with a bunch of people Tyke is friends with and talking about both funny and non-funny stuff is great.  But this time there isn't a real desire for something more that Tyke leaves wanting.  He just leaves happy and content with everything.  Talking with Dotti had a lot to do with it.   They almost solely talked about Tyke.  And, though this could sound vain, it is just great to talk about Tyke and his life.  Even though he almost always does it is helpful.  Tyke explained when he was really happy this year and his situation now and past girl troubles and current ones and just everything.  But it was a pretty happy conversation.  Not depressing at all.  Very chill.  They even talked about Tyke's chest and heart and his parents and everything.  It was just very nice.  Tyke and Tina played some ping pong and Frederique played as well and they were all hyper and such and it was funny.  But Tyke's favorite time was when he was just sitting and talking.  Tyke really does love that.  He cherishes that.  He values that highly.  Tyke and Purdy didn't talk a lot but at the end they shared some laughs.  When Tyke made another smartypants-type joke.  Dotti was saying she gave up sweets and Tyke goes, "Then why are you sitting here with me??"  It was funny.  Purdy said that was a good one too.  Tyke was really on fire.  But not literally.  Man, tonight was a really great night.  Tyke was so pleased with it that he is going to thank everyone that was there.  Thanks (he isn't going to actually go through and name individually cuz that would be superfluous at this point).  But seriously, tonight was great.  Hopefully it won't be a long time until the next night like this.  Because that is not fun.  Tyke can't take the rollercoaster of high school.  And his rollercoaster is probably the weakest one out there.  That's sad.  But Tyke is afraid of heights and such and doesn't like rollercoasters.  But that's beside the point.  Basically, the moon is out and so is Tyke.

      So it is almost the weekend again.  That's...coool.  Today was alright.  Ya know what?  Tyke is in one of those ruts right now.  Not emotionally persay.  But more of a blog rut.  It still doesn't have its flair anymore.  It lacks that certain something that gave Tyke a mini-rush for writing it.  And it takes time.  But then again, Tyke just realized that he shouldn't "whine" about not wanting to blog.  That would be stupid.  Because it isn't like he is being forced to blog.  He could easily stop one night and just not do it.  Tyke actually thinks that he could just not do it for a night and then resume the next day without anyone even noticing.  At least for a few days.  But that could be a poor assumption.  Anyway, Tyke will just continue to blog in brevity until he feels the desire to beef it up again.  1st period was pretty funny today.  Tyke was supposed to be in this one group for a presentation but he decided to go work in a group that actually had some stuff done and he made a nice contribution too so he wasn't just taking credit.  But the group he was supposed to be in was totally hilarious in their presentation.  Can't really be described on a blog though.  But it was classic.  The rest of the day was stupid.  4th period was kinda funny.  And then they left early again and went to JIB.  It was real real good.  They had so much time to eat too that they finished early even.  A great choice to go there early by Tyke.  Splendid.  Good pick by Amed to pick JIB as well.  The days really aren't that bad at school but Tyke isn't doing any homework and soon that will hurt him.  Like tonight he should have done this Graphics work, should have done some math (although he will do that in the morning), and could have done some english.  But he just doesn't want to.  So he doesn't.  Tyke has actually been doing less hw this semester than last he realized.  Ok, Tyke took about 20 minutes off from blogging just now.  Man, the Cougs are leading the Cardinal right now.  And Stanford is undefeated.  And the Cougs suck.  This is a great game.  Well, Tyke doesn't really have anything more to say since he has no idea what he has been talking about for most of the blog.  Hopefully Fejj makes the team tomorrow.  That would be cool.  But tomorrow means WEEKEND!!!  WISH TYKE LUCK!!!  (with what? nobody knows...)  Just so all of you that don't follow college basketball that well, Tyke will let you know something.  Tyke just witnessed one of the most incredible endings to a sports game ever.  The WSU Cougars were mere seconds away from pulling off an insane upset over the #1 ranked undefeated Stanford Cardinal.  But in the most dramatic finish in recent history the Cardinal, thanks to a fouled prayer by Matt Lottich, won in just flat out jaw-dropping fashion.  That was just remarkable.  Unbelievable.  Incredible.  Wowness.  Bye.  *mutters to himself as he "walks" away WOW.

      Damn it feels good to sleep until after 8.  Really good.  But today was a pretty boring day overall and hardly blogworthy so Tyke will most likely just breeze through this.  Additionally, as Tyke begins this blog he is watching the West Wing but it is a commercial break so he decided to start on it now so as to minimize the time he would have to take after the show is over to blog.  Just multi-tasking is all it is.  1st period there was a quiz today and it wasn't too bad so that is good.  2nd period was 8 minute abs which is fun and beneficial.  3rd period was another day like the previous.  The teacher is really quite mad at the class.  West wing...Ok, that's over now.  Yeah, the teacher is pretty frustrated with Tyke's class.  And man is it ever funny.  She told them today that they are the worst class she has ever had in her 8 years of teaching AP Gov.  Now that just builds the morale of the class, doesn't it?  She had yet another lecture to the class that just said that she was disappointed and that they were immature, etc.  These lectures are getting really old but this one was still funny.  Amed said he wanted to start clapping after her lecture cuz she hates that more than anything.  That would have been hilarious.  Simply hilarious.  Hopefully tomorrow she is back to her old push-over self and doesn't keep trying to get everyone to be on task.  They do have a test though, so probably not.  Then there was 4th period.  It was a boring class for the most part.  But it was only 38 minutes long.  Then they went to lunch at Mickey D's and they left right away so they had a lot of time to eat.  It was really nice.  A pleasant change from the ordinary.  5th and 6th period droned on and passed.  Then so did after school.  Tyke worked on his baller for ESPN and he is really quite good now.  Perfect at blocks as well as 3-ptrs.  Not to mention rebounding.  He is a star now.  Not just a 3-pt shooter.  He is now a star.  Which is cool.  So Tyke had Burger King for dinner and played basketball and the only homework he did was watch West Wing.  Which wasn't actually homework either, just extra credit.  And he still has to write up a review of it or something like that.  But that's about it.  Well, today hardly had anything blogworthy as he mentioned before.  Which is kinda sad.  Oh yeah, Dotti called Tyke after school.  That was a nice unexpected gift.  Always great to hear her voice on the other end.  Boys will be boys (no relevance to any situation, the phrase just popped into Tyke's head now).

      So today came and went and Tyke doesn't really feel like blogging so he will try and make it short.  Nothing much to say about today.  1st period involved Tyke running to his car and back to class in 2 minutes and then later on going down to the Commons to "do a lab" but really they just talked to people there.  Like Haras.  Haras asked Tyke if he would do an act for the talent show on Tolo week.  Tyke said, why not?  So he is going to have to make that up sometime soon.  If he does do one.  It isn't definite yet but it would be fun and Tyke can make it funny.  If it was super secret that would be cool.  Maybe he will do that.  Just make up a totally secretive show.  Then perform it.  But then it would have to be really good.  Whatever, it is only the beginning...Well the rest of the day was simple.  Ah yes.  3rd period.  That was funny.  Tyke's teacher finally called up Tyke to talk to him about his homework assignment from Friday.  Yeah, that was an interesting talk.  Of course nothing came of it but it was kinda hard to not laugh while he kept complimenting the teacher and saying she was doing a good job and that it wasn't her fault the class was rowdy, etc.  Oh man, good times.  4th period involved not doing anything.  But he did get homework in there that isn't fun.  When the homework is a creative writing assignment Tyke will definitely do it.  Otherwise, it just is a coin flip.  Oh, that gives him an idea.  Next assignment he gets in there he will just flip a coin to see whether or not he will do it.  Haha, that will be funny.  It's really a win-win situation there.  If he does it he wins because he will get some points, if he doesn't do it then he will win by not having to do it.  Lunch was at Subway but Tyke brought in his sub from home so it was a free lunch but still good.  The rest of the day was stupid.  Tyke did go with Skippy to B2 after school though.  But all they ended up doing was get a Strawberry Smoothie at Orange Julius.  But it was extremely good.  EXTREMEly.  Then Tyke came home, played ESPN, fell asleep accidentally again, returned Purdy's text, played some bball, ate dinner from Taco Time, sorta started his english hw, watched MXC, played bball, checked his email, breathed, brushed his teeth, did laundry, blinked, stood in his room facing the mirror with the lights off and then turned them on and watched his pupils enlarge and shrink as he repeated this, and blogged.  Not necessarily in order of completion though.  But it could be.  But it isn't.  Ok, Tyke is going to go to bed now.  Cuz he...yeah, just might want to get some sleep.  Tolo's coming up.  Oh, and 9 days.  Soon to be 8.  Then 7...6...5...4...3...2...1......

      Tyke is tired.  He got a little bit less than 6 hours of sleep for Monday and the days events just pooped him out.  So maybe he will go to bed before 10 tonight.  This blog will have a large say in whether or not he does get to bed on time.  After writing that sentence Tyke sat in his chair slouched for about 30 seconds and kinda rubbed his chin and his left eye and thought about his blog streak and his trip to Europe.  Then he wrote.  Tyke will try and inform you on what he is physically doing while blogging more often he has decided.  It is a good space filler.  And can at times be funny.  Today was at times funny.  As most days are.  Tyke had to get ready a little more than normal before leaving to school today.  Because of such items as CDs and hats and such.  1st period really was a pretty easy day and didn't feel too horrible.  The teacher looked more like a man than usual today though.  But he wasn't too bad.  She wasn't too bad, Tyke means.  Then weight training was fun because they started doing testing.  And of course they started out with dots.  Tyke owned dots pretty well last semester.  And then his whole group went and most of the class did and they were pretty bad.  So Tyke felt good about his time.  Macaroon somehow had an insane time though and there is no way Tyke can beat that.  Probably not even within 2 seconds.  Oh, and it was legs day so Tyke kept working out his legs and especially his calves.  He sorta wished after school that he hadn't worked out so hard but he'll talk about that later.  3rd period had an interesting beginning.  On Friday Tyke turned in an assignment that he had just decided to totally make up funny answers to.  And then he turned it in.  Well to start off the period the teacher came up to Tyke and said she wanted to see him after school.  Haha, whoops.  Looks like that might not have been the best idea.  But he decided he didn't really want to go meet her after school.  So he didn't.  Shouldn't be a problem as he wasn't the only one she wanted to see and Tyke and he decided together they weren't gonna go.  Strength in numbers.  Tyke isn't afraid to see her, but he just thinks it would be a waste of valuable time.  Time is a commodity to Tyke.  He needs to cherish it and not waste it talking to a teacher about a silly little homework assignment.  But she still can't do anything to him even if he didn't come after school.  She probably forgot anyway.  Ha!  It is all funny.  4th period was pretty fun today.  The class all read some of the poems they had to write to turn in and Tyke's went over well as usual.  So did Amed's.  Amed took off where Tyke left off last time and wrote a nice wanton (gotta pronounce it Wahnt-uhn in this case) poem as well as another sexually explicit poem.  And those are the best of course.  For lunch the gang went to Pie but Tyke, Doc P, and Amed decided to head there right after they got out of 4th period (which is a few minutes early every day) and they managed to beat the rush nicely.  5th and 6th period were pretty much not blogworthy so Tyke just skips over that part of the day even though Tyke hung out with Purdy and set bball plans with Amed in that span.  As Tyke just mentioned Tyke and Amed finally got their one on one game set and played it at Tyke's house after school.  It was just a beautiful day and the game was played while basking in the warm sunlight.  Simply marvelous.  And so were the results of the games.  Game one started off sloppily for Tyke as he just decided to shoot some 2s.  And the hoop they played at he has never really had good luck shooting 2s on it so he was being pretty stupid to start with.  But he was still missing them.  Amed managed to get off to a quick 6-2 lead.  But that was it.  Tyke went on a 9-0 run and won the game 11-6.  That was a quick game so they played again, same rules.  Tyke just got off to an easy start and just took the game easily.  11-4.  Tyke had now won twice in a row.  So they played again.  Yeah, no problem for Tyke.  He won 11-6 again.  And Tyke was just continually blocking Amed's shots down low.  He couldn't post up on Tyke at all.  Game 4 brought a change.  Tyke was a little tired so from the beginning he just shot 2s but was missing them and couldn't get a good shot off.  And Amed did a good job of getting the rebounds so Amed managed to hold on for his first win, 11-8.  Tyke could have won, probably should have won, but Amed did play pretty well and Tyke wasn't really going after blocks as much.  They played one final game and this one was a blowout.  Tyke won 11-0 and had 6 blocks.  He totaled up a 52-27 overall win and had 16 blocks (more than 3 per game).  Basically, Tyke won.  Amed lost.  But he put up a good fight.  Afterwards Tyke ate a little and watched a little TV before settling down to more ESPN.  Tyke's baller is quite good now.  And his 'Nics franchise is undefeated so far as well.  Tyke had a nice sub for dinner and has one he can have for lunch tomorrow too, so maybe he will bring that in and eat that.  And then he could get the free 6" at Subway to go along with it.  Yes, this is going to look good.  Tyke calls card!  Yep, first to call it.  Oh yeah, and Tyke didn't do any of his homework of course.  So don't bother to ask him.  Ok, another day is gone.  The countdown is getting pretty dang low.  That's weird.  Tyke can't get no...good vibrations.

      To start off, Tyke would just like to welcome any new readers to this bodacious blog.  Don't be afraid to share the url with others so that you can let the whole world in on the 24th wonder of the world (there's got to be a lot more wonders more wondrous than this blog so that is why this is 24th).  And yeah, this blog is going to take a long time to write.  Yeah, a hella long time.  This is taking forever.  But that isn't too bad cuz it is just fueling the fire with logs to burn.  The logs are topics for conversation by the way.  Man, today was a pretty damn good Sunday.  Woke up about 10:30 but since Kinker was still here since he slept over he already had a friend over.  So that was cool.  They had a good breakfast and then played some MOH and ESPN.  For a long time.  Quite a long time.  Kinker left about 4 or so.  So they spent most of the day just hanging out and not doing anything.  Tyke made a found poem with Kink and watched some tv before he left.  And Tyke's bro came home to work on some FAFSA stuff for law school.  It's pretty cool to Tyke that his brother is going into law.  Not sure why but it makes him feel proud.  After Kink left he talked with his mom and brother about their trip to Europe and possible destinations and such.  It is fun to talk about what they are going to see and where they are going to go.  It gets him all excited.  Going to Europe.  Man, Tyke Turner in Europe.  Oh shit!  How is he going to blog when he's there?!?!?!?!!  YIKES!  Anyway, Tyke had dinner while watching the Oscars and talking about them.  Then he did a little hw and watched some tv.  His brother was leaving so they talked about school and how Tyke was not doing any work anymore and that kind of thing.  Then Dotti came over!!!  To pick Tyke up for REFUGE!!!  Yep, Tyke is now going to Refuge.  And Tina came to pick him up so they all went there and it was fun.  Tyke liked the songs and apparently they aren't even that good so that is a good sign.  And even though it is religious and Tyke has never been it is still interesting.  It makes Tyke think about everything.  And literally everything.  His life as a whole.  Which is good.  This all doesn't mean that Tyke is becoming uber-religious.  And it isn't like Tyke was ever atheist or agnostic or on either extreme.  He was just oblivious to religion really.  His only experiences with church was flipping through channels that had those sermons on them.  But those are bad.  And Tyke kinda had only that as a reference point for all of religion.  So he never really gave it a chance.  But he was always curious and intrigued.  Now he is just giving himself the chance to find things out.  He is not getting brainwashed.  He is not getting misled by the female fancy (although man would that ever work on Tyke ;).  Tyke is just searching now you could say.  Not necessarily for God but just searching to see if there is anything out there he didn't know about before that now he wants to know about.  But it is really great to get to hang out with the girls at least once on the weekend.  After refuge Tyke came home in a really good mood so he has been talking online for a long time and trying to blog but it has taken over an hour and a half so far.  It is way harder than most people think to blog.  Tyke gets sidetracked and loses his thoughts.  So it gets ramblescent.  Man, Tyke smells something really good right now.  Dr. Phil knows what it is though.  Damn that.  But Tyke needs to go to sleep now.  It is almost 11 on a Sunday night and it takes Tyke a while to sleep on Sunday since he just watches TV.  So Tyke is happy right now.  Only one thing missing from him.  And that isn't a big deal because it all comes from within anyway.  So take care.

      So, this is going to be weird.  Tyke is not only blogging relatively early for a "Saturday night" but he is also being watched.  Literally.  By a human.  A peer even.  Mr. Kinker is on the southeast side of Tyke as he types.  But he just got up and moved so now he is more south but a little west.  And laughing.  And moved again.  But that would take a long time to continually do updates on so he will stop.  Now.  Yep.  Now.  Ok, so this is really quite weird.  Cuz Tyke usually talks what he is saying through while he does it but he isn't now.  And he usually takes breaks from writing which is pretty much the main reason for Tyke taking so long to complete each night's activities.  So here goes for Saturday though.  Tyke got up nice and late on Saturday.  12:30.  He easily could have slept longer too.  But he didn't want to waste the entire day.  So Tyke pretty much did nothing all day.  He ate some bfast after getting up and then traversed around the house accomplishing pretty much nothing.  But then he started to play ESPN and that was fun.  He played it for a really long time and realized something.  It got hard to improve his player so he made a new one later on at night.  He made Kinker and Tyke realized it is much easier to do what Tyke found out than what he had been doing.  So thats how that went.  And then Tyke got a few phone calls throughout the day.  And they were fine.  Not much relevance to any other ideas or actions of Tyke but they were satisfying in their ways.  Man, this is really weird.  Tyke feels like he is talking to Kinker right now because as Tyke types, Kinker reads.  But since they aren't speaking to each other it is just like it is...eh, it's weird.  Kinker agrees that it is weird.  After the phone calls and such, Tyke got himself his lunch.  It was pizza.  Good pizza.  Day old pizza which many times tastes better than the first day pizza.  But it was heated up for 45 seconds in the microwave and Tyke ate it thoroughly.  With A&W Cream Soda on the side.  In a can though.  Not just in a pool of cream soda'd goodness.  Then Tyke putzed around more and more and played ESPN and later on he even ate dinner.  It was really good.  French toast and scrambled eggs.  For dinner.  Mmmmmy goodness.  Then a little later Macaroon came over and they played a little Soul Calibur II.  Then Kinker joined.  And they played some more but decided they wanted to play cards instead.  So as they were doling out the chip quantities Skippy walked in.  And he got in on the action as well.  So they all played for a while.  This night was much different from the last.  As Tyke did not buy in one extra time.  Only the initial.  And he ended up getting way ahead but played a little silly and lost some of his winnings.  He still got $7.50 though.  The winnings paid out in $4 and a free slice card from Pie.  Which will be very valuable come Thursday or Friday.  That is a good win for him.  After that they played Halo.  And it was really funny.  Just cuz they were being super silly...ous (get it?).  They played for a while and then decided to watch the most recent Talking Sex episode.  It was even more hilarious this time Tyke watched it than the last he thinks.  Things are funnier when everybody else is laughing hard at them.  So things were funny funny this time.  It was really good.  Best episode yet according to Tyke...at least at the moment.  Skippy left during the show and it was just the three boys left.  After that they played Shithead for a few rounds but then decided to do something new.  Tyke made up the inverse of Shithead or "The Shit" and they played that.  All cards that are dealt up are actually dealt down and all down cards are up.  It makes for a really hard time trying to guess what is in your hand since you can't see it.  It might even be better than Chinko.  But the first playing is always the best.  After that is where you really find out the quality of the game.  So a few games of that passed and the night was pretty much completed.  And then Tyke blogged.  With Kinker's eye over his shoulder.  Not like directly but indirectly.  And probably not now either cuz then Tyke would hear Kinker laughing and he isn't.  So yeah, he still isn't.  Ok, well this was quite a little escapade.  Night is done.  Now.

      Tyke really doesn't feel like blogging right now.  Not in the mood for it.  But it will be short.  School was fine.  The tests were all pretty hard in their own right but not horrible.  After school Piggy J and Tyke came back to Tyke's pad for a little and chilled and then came back to the school for the baseball game.  Skippy came down and joined Purdy, Tina, Tig Ol, Piggy J, and Tyke.  Then Karla came down later and she watched too as well as Amed.  After the game the gang had to keep Purdy out because of her surprise birthday party at her house.  So they all went up to Tyke's and watched some videos and Tyke and Skippy gave Purdy her presents from them.  She did seem to like them so that is good.  After Purdy and Tig left the guys had to quickly head on down to Purdy's house to wait for the surprise.  It was a really fun party.  It makes it so much better since Tyke knows everyone there.  He didn't use to and that made it somewhat awkward.  But now it is just fun.  Tyke talked with a lot of people and played some DDR with Macaroon.  Tyke and Tina hung out for a while.  And Haras.  Tyke and Haras finally got to hang out some more.  Since they hardly ever hang out now it seems.  Which is sad because they are such good friends.  But this is just the beginning.  It will keep on escalating from this point forward.  But tonight was really fun and Tyke really hopes that Purdy had a really great time and that she isn't too stressed about anything.  Oh, and the walk to Tyke's car wasn't fun.  But that's no biggy.  One more thing.  Tyke took on Kram in ping-ping at the party.  Damn, damn, damn.  Tyke went up quickly 11-3 and was just showcasing all his talents but somehow he just started to have too many unforced errors.  When all was said and done, Kram won 21-19.  Tyke really wanted to win that game.  Yeah, really.  Damn.  But yeah, nights like this have a feel to them.  This night is no different.  Goodnight.

      Happy birthday to Purdy today.  She certainly got a lot of good attention for it being her birthday.  Not to mention some enormous balloons that occasionally got in Tyke's way when they were walking.  But it was a good day.  The fog had definitely set in when Tyke woke up.  It was foggalicious.  Hardly any of the day was hard.  Actually none of the day was hard.  Except maybe power cleans in weight training but you can hardly call that difficult.  Just not the most fun thing Tyke could have been doing.  3rd period was pretty much a joke, as it usually is but this time in a different way.  It was mostly spent talking (whining some might say) about the Senior Project and how the goddamn Juniors don't have to do it but Tyke's class is still doing it to completion.  A really cool idea came up in class about some of the students going down to Olympia for a field trip to talk about the idiocies of the senior project.  It would be a lot of fun most likely.  But it will not happen.  How cool would it be to get a bus and drive that down there though?  A student drive it that is.  That would be insanely cool.  Tyke's never driven a bus before.  Nothing bigger than his Dodge Grand Caravan in fact.  As always the day forged on and english was also a joke.  Tyke put a post-it on his forehead that had 10 written on it.  That, combined with throwing the aforementioned post-it at the teacher from about 5 feet away without her knowing, was the highlight of the period.  Lunch at Taco Time was splendid even though the stupid worker there always screws up orders.  He didn't even give Tyke a number so they came out with the same number for Dr. Phil's food twice.  And Dr. Phil didn't even get the right food.  After lunch though is when it was really fun.  Good old 5th period.  Yep, another substitute.  Day 3 of Operation Try Your best To Keep out of Every class, or TYKE, worked very well.  Tyke was in class for 4 minutes yesterday but he beat that time with a 2 minute appearance today.  He just kept walking and sitting out in the sun and he and Macaroon went out to Tyke's car for a while and listened to music in the sun.  A fabulous day out again.  Tyke talked with a few people outside the school and then went back to the parking lot and waited for Purdy.  She was a little later than usual so Tyke was still in the parking lot when the bell rang for class.  But Macaroon was smart and brought out Tyke's backpack for him from class and gave it to Tyke as he was running back to class.  All was fine and Tyke and Purdy made it to Physics with plenty of time (as the bell rang).  Physics was fun cuz they just talked about flicking off little Japanese girls and taking their noses and kaleidoscopes and the lab that will be done at Tyke's house on Sunday.  After school was quite fun too.  Tyke has played a lot of basketball this week.  Today included.  They went up to Amed's house but had more people this time.  Tyke picked up both Big and Little Twigg on his way to pick up a jew and someone whose last name sounds exactly the same as "jew" before getting up to Amed's court.  Little Twigg is quite good.  He certainly stopped Tyke from dominating the games like he had sort of (not totally but yeah, kinda) been doing the past few times.  Tyke still had some nice moments like a bunch of left handed finger rolls in and a sick steal of a pass that was thrown by Amed like 15 inches above Tyke's head (probably less than 15 inches cuz that sounds like a lot but it could have been more too...the point is that Tyke looked like Nate Robinson getting way up) and he just snatched that ball out of the sky.  He took a bit of a beating from the bigger and more physical Little Twigg though.  He was tough to guard.  Tyke did probably a bogey job guarding him.  But offensively he was pretty good as long as he wasn't shooting treys.  The fadeaway jumper is his game.  And Tyke also noticed he shoots differently the mid-range J from the long-range J.  The mid-range shot Tyke lets go higher up and more like an NBA player would.  But Tyke doesn't shoot it well if he does that from downtown so he has a lower release point from outside.  Not uncommon but it's pretty noticeable.  Basketball was fun though.  Piggy J did not make an appearance this time though.  Tyke called him but didn't get an answer.  Then Piggy called him back a few times but Tyke wasn't there.  It's ok.  Cuz the Dawgs won.  They should really be in the tourney now.  One more win has to guarantee them a spot.  They are good.  Nobody really takes over the game it doesn't seem like though.  They all chip in very well and are a great up-tempo team.  Very fun to watch.  Especially cuz of Nate Robinson.  Even if he doesn't do anything spectacular you enjoy watching him cuz you are just waiting for that unbelievable play.  Kinda like when you watch Tyke ;).  It's not even 9 yet.  Oh yeah, stupid 3 tests tomorrow.  Stupid no studying for 3 tests tomorrow.  Stupid not caring about 3 tests tomorrow.  Oh wait, that last one is good.

      A nice and early start to the blog routine today.  For Tyke has to watch West Wing at 9 and that goes until 10 so Tyke thought he should do/start his blog now.  And he is tired anyway.  He really played hard today.  But not after he slept in late.  He got up around 8:20 and it was really foggy out.  He pictured that as a good sign for the weather though as often times when it is foggy early it is sunny later.  This would be one of those days.  Tyke got a nice jumpstart to his morning today by going out and getting gas.  It doesn't take Tyke any longer in the morning to get gas than it does to just drive straight to school.  Because he takes a different route when he gets gas is the reason for this.  Today there was quite a bit of traffic though.  But getting gas is a good way to wake up.  It gets Tyke out of his car and walks around and inhales the intoxicating aroma of gasoline and it is just fun.  Unless his hands smell like gas afterwards.  That part sucks but it doesn't happen often.  And Tyke showcased his great driving skills by maneuvering his car out of a tight squeeze when the Chevron guy in a hoooge truck showed up there.  The school day wasn't too bad either with 1st period being the worst and really it wasn't bad at all.  3rd period was fine except now apparently there is a quasi-boycott (ironic use of quasi) to occur tomorrow of that class.  Some students are outraged at the most recent tyrannical episode by the teacher when she imposed a referral on one of the class' own.  This enraged some of the leaders of the class and they are "saying" that there will be a boycott tomorrow.  Tyke is not going to participate however as he really doesn't want to have to face the consequences of it.  You can call Tyke a pussy too if you would like as he truly does not mind.  Tyke just does not want to have to face any reprimands from his parents.  And he is already on the bad side of his government teacher and actually would like to get back on her good side.  He is starting to succeed he thinks, so far.  The main point is that if you would like to boycott 3rd period then you seem to have some company.  4th period was a gay period today.  Stupid timed write from the 1991 AP test.  It was dumb.  Could have been easy but probably not.  This is the first AP test they have done in there all year, Tyke believes.  Last year at this point they had probably done about 10.  With like another 5 left.  Tyke has not been prepared for his AP tests at all this year.  Not at all.  It is just last year's knowledge seeping back through the limitless sports knowledge to come to the surface and be used again.  However, a majority of the time the knowledge that seeps back through has sports knowledge attached to it so he gets a little confused at what he was doing and then just thinks about sports.  But lunch was good.  JIB tasted good.  And the weather was fabulous.  Then class got fun.  He had 5th period, which isn't usually fun but BOOM!  Tyke gets the same sub as yesterday.  Immediately he reacts to Macaroon and is ecstatic by it.  After about 2 minutes Tyke makes his departure.  This is where the fun started.  Tyke talked to Big Twigg for about 15 seconds.  Then he saw Dotti and talked to her for a little while.  He just kept walking around the school though and talking to people as they actually came out of class and hung out with Tyke for a little.  Nobody out of Ritzer's class though.  Damn.  Tyke even went out to his car for a little then came back.  Yeah, Macaroon just called and ate up a couple of minutes.  No real point to that phone call but thats alright.  Oh yeah, 5th period.  Well Tyke came back and talked to Dotti some more and kept walking around when Amed came out.  So he went to the bathroom and then joined Tyke down at Tyke's car.  They listened to some good old Jack Johnson.  It was really nice.  Tyke even started his car and drove it around the parking lot and then backed it back into his spot.  Just so he can say that while skipping 5th period he drove somewhere.  As Amed left Tyke slowly walked around the parking lot trying to see if he could catch Purdy coming back from elementary tutor.  Guess what...he did.  She seemed surprised by his appearing there, justifiably so.  They chatted and started walking back to Tyke's class because the 38 minute class period was almost up.  Purdy suddenly realized that she forgot something in her car so she had to go back for it.  Tyke went back to his class, grabbed his backpack, looked around, then left again.  Still before the bell too.  Tyke was in class today for 4 minutes.  It was just great.  He met back up with Purdy and they went to Physics where they had a fun little demonstration to start off the period.  But before class started everyone was watching the two class turtles go at it.  Those turtles were really boning.  Damn.  Einstein (or Keppler, whichever one is the male) seemed pretty content up there.  Watching two turtles "copulate" is pretty hot.  Let Tyke tell you.  Now there is a natural aphrodesiac.  After school Tyke cruised home with his left arm out the window and changed and ate a little.  Then he headed up to Amed's bball court.  Maniak was already there and the three of them played a little 21 waiting for Skippy to arrive.  Tyke won 21 of course.  Then they played 2-2 and Tyke and Skippy won of course.  Then they played for a while longer until Skippy left and they played these Asians that were just shooting around and smoking some cigs on the other half of the court.  As they started this, Piggy J arrived after his little "turn your head and cough" minus the "cough" part.  Actually, that isn't even true.  None of that last part was true.  But that's ok.  Piggy J and the other 3 took on the 3 Asians.  Tyke flat out dominated.  He was pretty much unstoppable.  He scored like 9 of the first 10 points himself.  Amed had some nice assists as did Maniak and Piggy J.  The Asians got pwned.  After that ownage they switched up the teams and Tyke's team continued to dominate.  It is really fun to be the best player on the court.  Anytime.  Tyke tried to dunk but of course he was like 3" too short.  Basically got blocked by the rim.  Or maybe he didn't even get high enough to get blocked by the rim.  Dunking is hard.  Especially for an under 6' white guy like Tyke.  But Nate Robinson can do it and he's only 5'9" at the tallest.  He is just built.  Has to have like a 42" vertical.  At least.  If Tyke could jump 42" that would be insane.  He could pretty much put his hand on the top of the backboard.  How cool would that be?  Maybe he couldn't do that as he doesn't actually know what his vertical is.  He wants to find out.  Cuz he truly thinks he can jump pretty darn high.  Enough of that.  Tyke improved his baller on ESPN even more.  Now only Steals and Ball Handling can be improved.  His guy is real good.  So far this blog has taken 35 minutes to do.  Pretty soon it will be over.  1 more day.  3 more hours.  Thats cool.  Annnnnnnd scene.

      61 more days.  Just 61 more days.  That isn't too much.  And some of those days are going to be just flat out easy and fun.  So really, just another 50+ days of the "grind."  This year has not been that bad.  Tyke's work ethic has made it not that bad but after last year, this year has been something of a breeze.  Sure, Tyke thought at the beginning of the year his classes were easy enough to get a 4.0 in and yet he comes out with below a 3 for the first time ever, but hey ;).  Back to the current though.  Damn, Tyke's skinny.  Tyke just looked at his left arm and went (literally) "Damn!  I'm skinny."  Tyke is 5'11.5" and weighs 132 pounds.  But he is an animal playing basketball so watch out.  Again, back to the current, although technically that last rambling would also be considered skinny unless Tyke is dead.  He could be dead to another world in a far off place.  If you look at stars for example, many (all??) have already blown up but we just see them in the past.  So yeah, Tyke is most likely dead to some other thingy out there.  Tyke does believe that there is other forms of life.  If you think of how many galaxies there are in the universe then the probability of there not being life has to be so minute that it is just...wow, mind boggling.  Yet again, back to today.  This time for real though.  Tyke got up at the 6:20 hour.  And was quite tired.  After his shower he came back into his room to pick up his cell phone and shoes he is going to wear for the day (which lately has been his And 1's as he wears those for wt train and it is easier to just wear them to school everyday).  When he got in his room he just about collapsed on his bed cuz he was so tired.  He really wanted to just let his body fall forward from where he was standing and let it go where it wants.  But that would have been painful as he was about 5 feet from the bed so he would have smacked hard into the end of the bed with something he most likely would not want to have smacked up against anything.  But he didn't do any smacking.  Instead he did some snacking.  1.5 Chocolate Chip Kudos bars.  He just can't eat breakfast very often.  He is hungry and knows he will be later on but he just can't force himself to eat enough to constitute a healthy breakfast.  His mom and him actually talked about that at dinner for some reason.  But Tyke had a very slow day.  1st period was a group test and that certainly didn't wake him up but it did allow him to try and showcase his intelligence.  He did to an extent.  But 2nd period he was dead.  3rd period also dead.  He and Purdy were supposed to work on a gov thing but he could hardly focus on anything.  Not even her ;p.  And certainly not the material as it was some stupid diseases or bureaucracy crap.  Won't matter in the end.  4th period he sorta started to wake up.  By then end of the period he was pretty awake as he had been doing his "Scroggmentations" as Amed coined.  Tyke thinks he is pretty good at them.  He at least gives Amed a case of the chuckles so that is worthwhile enough.  Tyke took the Avalon out with Dr. Phil and Amed to Mickey D's.  Decent enough.  The rest of the day wasn't much fun.  When Tyke was tired he sort of seemed like he was in a bad mood.  Maybe because he was tired but maybe not.  Hopefully because he was tired.  But probably not.  Not because he was tired.  Not not because he was tired.  Maybe because he was tired.  But yeah, that's about all on that.  After school was some more Tyke-Tyke time.  He just played some ESPN and the usual after school activities with himself.  Then he ate some Chinese food with his parents and talked about his heart and chest and Halloween costume and 70s pornstars and the weather.  Ya know, what everyone talks about with their parents.  Well, tomorrow is going to be good because not only is it Wednesday and semi-good weather time but Tyke is going to fill up his car with gas in the morning (meaning he will be awake and pumped-get it??-for school) and the Decathletes will be back from their conference thingy as well.  So Dotti and Haras will be back and Tyke will enjoy that thoroughly.  That is one great thing to look forward to about this Wednesday.  Hmm...what else???  Oh yeah, SLEEP!  Another thing, after school Tyke went with Skippy and Macaroon to Ted Meyer's after school for some "shopping."  Man, there is some funny stuff there.  That monkey was insanely cool.  Cats don't deserve that toy.  Humans do.  Waaaaaahhhhhhh-waaaaaahhhhh-aaaaaahhhhh-rreeeeeeerrr!  Damn, Tyke forgot another thing about his day.  In 5th period today he had a substitute.  Boy was this cool.  Tyke left at 12:29 and walked a little bit before meeting up with Mandy in the halls for a nice hug and a little chat.  Then he met up with Macaroon and they went and listened to a song and got their butts and backs heated in Tyke's car.  They just went out to the parking lot and chilled there for a little.  Macaroon then went back to class but Tyke kept walking around.  And around.  And around.  He finally came back to class at 12:52.  He grabbed a few Zingos (like Altoids) from Macaroon and then headed back out without notifying the sub for some more adventures.  This time he left at 12:53.  He still didn't find anyone to talk to though so he ended up just walking around the entire school multiple times and 7 times past Ritzer's class cuz he knows a lot of people in there and wanted to see if anyone was coming out.  But nobody did.  So Tyke just kept on walking and walking and walking.  He and Macaroon figured he walked more than a mile after he returned to class at 1:07, only 2 minutes before the clean-up bell.  So he was gone for 37 minutes.  69.8% of that class period he was outside walking the school.  It was just great.  But damn, Tyke's legs are tired.

      Mondays can be summed up quite well by a mini-conversation Tyke, Purdy, and Kinker had after leaving Physics today.  To paraphrase, Mondays are just like the first day back from break where you get eased back into the normal routine.  Almost all of Tyke's Mondays involve the students doing some easy little crap or busy work or something.  Basically, Mondays are pretty relaxing days.  Which has been very pleasant.  And man was today great.  An absolutely awesome start to the week.  Tyke woke up a few minutes before his alarm and he was startled by the brightness outside reflected by his curtains.  So he thought it was late and then looked at his alarm and it said 6:17 and that panicked him a little.  Then he realized, oh my alarm doesn't go off til 6:20.  So he closed his eyes and seemingly 20 seconds later his alarm went off and he got up.  He put on some clothes that he thought would be nice for the day but he was wrong.  Upon coming upstairs and finding out the weather he realized that he was gonna be overdressed.  That's too bad cuz it was just beautiful out.  But it wasn't too hot.  3rd period was quite pleasant today.  The DECA decathletes (just made it up) were all gone and that was quite a fat load of the populace.  Dotti was gone as she is a decathlete which sucked but Tyke did get to have a footrest in front of him by using the empty chair.  So even though she wasn't in class, she was still indirectly giving him pleasure (and not the naughty kind ;p).  4th period was entertaining in that Tyke, Amed, and Dr. Phil (although not Amed) tried to blow their gum up in the air and catch it back in their mouth.  Tyke failed the first try but the next two times he owned that gum.  Just flat out chewed it up.  Lunch was awesome.  Went down to Pie but they ate outside in the cloudless sunny sky.  Just awesome weather.  Splendiferous.  After school Tyke gave Purdy some advice on getting rid of headaches and then he tried to scrounge up some people for some bball.  Amed, Skippy, and Piggy J all agreed to it.  Karla and Maniak both initially said they would/might but they were unable to attend.  But they still had even numbers so that was good.  Tyke won 21 and then his team won each game to 11.  It was fun.  Tyke has not been finishing that well around the hoop on easy shots.  He still hits most of the harder layups but not good enough.  He needs to improve finishing.  Cuz he can rebound and drive pretty well outdoors so he just needs to work on getting a higher percentage of shots to fall.  And Tyke could hardly hit anything but his fadeaway jumper today.  He really isn't that good of an outside shooter though so that is expected.  He is streaky.  One of the best things about today's bball was that Piggy J brought an old school boom box and they played Pink Floyd the whole time.  Loud.  With little kids all around.  And parents.  One guy even commented that he wanted the music turned up.  Yeah, Pink Floyd rox.  So does Led Zepplein.  And the 4 Tops.  Haha, physics was funny.  There is just so much good music that is old but really deserves to be listened to.  Tyke is pleased to know that others share his view.  Kudos to all who think like Tyke.  Screw wanting to be like Tyke.  "I wanna be like Tyke!"  That sounds like a good way to finish this blog.  Even though there is more that could be said.  Keep on Tyke-liking!

      As if it wasn't bad enough to blog on Sunday morning.  It is much worse doing it on Sunday night.  For that is the time where it is all over.  The only thing separating Tyke from Monday/school is blogging, Love Line, and sleeping.  Before Tyke starts off, he would like to apologize to Piggy J for his absence on the list of friends that were present on Friday night at Purdy's.  That was an oversight on Tyke's part which he attempted to explain that he was out of it a little while blogging but that is still not an excuse.  But that is done with.  Piggy J is here now.  So today was a very lax day.  Beginning at 11 is quite nice.  Getting out of bed at 11:30 is even "quite nicer."  Tyke putzed around all day (Tyke says that a lot).  There was nothing he really wanted to do but it wasn't like he was bored.  He played ESPN, ate, talked online, played poker.  Everything but homework really.  But he didn't have any he doesn't think so thats cool.  He watched some of the Full House marathon and this other show on ABC Family.  Tyke doesn't exactly like that channel though but Full House is on it and that show Tyke does like.  But Tyke had a pretty nice Sunday where he just chilled with himself and played some good games.  A nice relaxing way to ease back into the week.  A week that will have more than 3 tests.  Tyke just realized he has multiple tests this week.  Not that he will have to worry about studying (cuz he doesn't care enough to) but just it is boring taking tests and not getting to have fun.  Side note time.  Tyke and Amed are talking now about age and grade and being young for their grade and such and Tyke just got to realizing something.  If Tyke's parents had decided to hold him back (he was born a week before the "cutoff" for schooling) then his life would be so much different.  Tyke would have driven his parents crazy they say cuz he was so rowdy and just never kept still cuz he was so ready to get out into the world.  But that is not even the most important thing.  Tyke wouldn't be friends with everyone he is friends with.  Some of the people he would probably still be friends with but really, the people he is closest to, he most likely would not be friends with.  And that is a depressing thought.  Because as much as Tyke kills himself thinking about what he is wanting but missing from his close friends he still does love them and would be sad if he got to know them but then didn't get to stay friends.  Wow, that is sad.  Tyke needs to move on.  So Tyke went to Refuge again tonight.  He is now a repeat offender.  Except you wouldn't use the word offender unless you were Tyke and trying to allude to something else that implies that some are against Tyke going to Refuge.  Did ya get that?  But Refuge is fun.  Tyke gets to have a nice little last hurrah on Sunday and see some friends.  But also he gets to think about his life and relationships.  Tyke, at this point, does not take so much a religious message from Refuge as he does a life message.  Some may feel they are the same thing but Tyke does not.  He has never been religious-or uber-religious either:)- so what he hears about God and such he doesn't really relate to.  He's not saying he won't at some point but right now he just relates to his personal experiences that are more relationship-centric and really, girl-centric.  So basically, Sunday nights are reserved for Tyke thinking about girls.  But not despondently.  In a beneficial manner.  Speaking of beneficial things.  Sleep sure is beneficial.  So maybe Tyke will go do that now.

      It is too bad that as Tyke writes this it is Sunday.  Saturday night blogs suck writing.  They are at a bad time cuz Tyke is tired and he wants to go to sleep and they are usually after a good day that Tyke wishes wasn't over.  And also it means that the last day of the week is coming which means that a new week will be beginning.  So as Tyke recaps today's events, just remember that Tyke is not having fun blogging the day.  Today started off at 10 AM for Tyke.  He got up and ate and showered and had a grand time reading the Times.  Then he went and got his haircut.  "Military-style" is the description of choice for Tyke.  But he always gets it pretty much the same and his hair grows pretty fast so that is why he gets it short.  He doesn't like the looks of it to begin with but Tyke really isn't too caring about personal appearance.  He likes looking different now.  You can probably tell by all the retro stuff he wears.  Although, by wearing that Tyke looks very much like everybody else now as it is the fashion of now.  70s shit is in hardcore if you look around.  Tyke even wears 2 shirts that his dad wore in the 1970s.  Yeah, literally wore in that great decade.  But it's fun.  And the aviators Tyke wears are just really cool.  Annnnnyyyyway after that Tyke went home and right as he was about to get home Macaroon called him.  So they planned stuff out to do.  Tyke went over to Macaroon's and was joined by Skippy, Amed, K-caj, and of course Macaroon.  They played bball first at Coug Ridge and they had a lot of sick shots that almost did , or did, fall.  Tyke won 21.  They played for a while but then went to Macaroon's and they played some poker.  $1 buy-ins so as to try and keep something of a sense of dignity to the game and it sorta worked.  But then they had to leave by 2:30 in order to pick up the Costco pizza and get back to Tyke's in time for the UW-Stanford game.  So at 2:15 they decided that if nobody won the pot by 2:30 then everyone would take back their buck and it would be a free game.  Well on the last hand Tyke bet 39 of his 40 cents on Macaroon and he called.  Then on the river Tyke bet his last cent and won with a pair.  So Amed was, to say the least, pleased cuz he did not want to lose the dollar.  After getting pizza and going to Tyke's they flipped on the game.  Man, this was a great game.  The WSU game was more exciting though.  But this one finished much better.  It was just spectacular.  And Nate the Great is such a stud.  He can jump so high.  After the game Tyke really wanted to play bball so they all went up to the court by Tyke's house and played there.  The team of Tyke and Macaroon played well but the team of Tyke and K-caj did not.  K-caj did start hitting some long 2s with the extremely wet ball though.  Tyke couldn't finish left handed for some reason but his left hand did the trick.  And Tyke is learning some good post moves now.  He just is getting much better this year at basketball.  He uses his size, all 6' 130 pounds of it, to really get an advantage.  And he didn't want to stop playing tonight.  Even though it was dark.  He wasn't tired.  He coulda gone on for a while more.  But they went back to Tyke's and talked online to some people.  Then they invited Tank out to dinner and back to Tyke's (that only sounds a little gay).  So they met up at Teriyaki Bistro and had a good time there.  Amed made his usual Asian jokes except he didn't notice that there was an Asian lady standing right next to him while he said it.  Yeah, that was hilarious.  He felt bad for it but it was still hilarious.  The gang watched some of the classic videos and laughed well.  Then they played another game of poker.  Tyke made it to the last three after Amed went out on the second hand and Macaroon after a while longer.  Then K-caj ended up winning it.  After Tank left, Amed came back and they played some The Shit.  Then they played some ESPN and everyone left.  And then Tyke blogged.  And then Tyke said good night.  Good night.

      Ok, wow can be said about Tyke's day.  This was crazy weird and sorta hectic for Tyke.  Many people would disagree but it was still very busy.  School was fine and the Tolo assembly was good, especially the video.  Haras and Karla did great jobs in their parts.  They are just so sexy.  As school progressed it got a little bit worse all the while but it was nothing too bad.  After school Tyke and Skippy got all ready for their ping-pong tournament.  It was pretty danged fun.  Quite a few people there in fact.  Tyke took out Macaroon in the first round but Tyke played really well.  Macaroon did a pretty good job but Tyke's return spinners were too much to handle.  The second round saw Tyke facing off against Skippy.  Which was bad.  Tyke was never able to take a commanding lead really and just lost it for a little bit.  He took a 7-6 lead and it was game point but Skippy came back and took the next 3 points to win.  It was, as Tyke believes, an upset but Skippy did deserve the W as he just played better than Tyke.  After a little while Ekul and the Sly Lion boys came over to partake in the action.  Ekul owned hardcore.  He is very very good and he did even bring his own paddle and shaving cream with which to smooth off his paddle.  Yeah, he is hardcore serious.  But extremely good too.  He won it all although he didn't get recognition for it necessarily because of his standing at another school.  But he was the best there.  And that is what matters most.  After this Tyke went home and this is when it got crazy.  He and his mom talked for a little about Tyke's Tolo outfit.  He put on the outfit and got it for her and they tried to decide what to add.  Then they thought about where they could find some good ideas after the internet didn't come up with anything good.  So Tyke's mom told him to go get The Great Gatsby movie from Blockbuster.  So he did.  While there, this girl said she really liked his Aviators and then asked if he was from Yakima.  Tyke said he just bought the shirt that had Yakima on it last night at Value Village and that he hadn't done the Habitat for Humanity thing.  Then the girl said that she had a friend who did "the stupid th...oh not that it was stupid."  Tyke interrupted and said that he didn't do it so he didn't care.  Then he got the movie and walked away.  He came back and he and his mom were watching it when his dad called and he had a doctor's appointment scheduled for the day and he was calling to say that he had to go to the hospital to have them look at his little problem.  So that was something weird.  But Tyke and his mom watched Great Gatsby when all of a sudden Macaroon showed up unexpectedly at the back door while the movie was on.  So that was weird.  Then he came in and sat down for a while as they watched and got ideas.  So finally Tyke found what he was doing.  And then Tyke's dad called again.  And he told them that he had to get surgery tonight on this hernia thing he has and that was totally unexpected.  But it wasn't major so there wasn't need to worry.  So Tyke's mom had to rush to the hospital and Tyke and Macaroon went down to Redmond again to try and get some of Tyke's costume stuff finally.  But the place was closed.  So they went to Value Village to shop some more for Tyke.  He ended up finding a good suit jacket to go with his get-up and then he had pretty much everything he needed besides the hat and suspenders.  But those can be purchased tomorrow still.  At Value Village they saw some fellow Issy's and talked for a little.  Then they went back home and watched some hoops before going to the lacrosse game at the school.  It was just Tyke, Macaroon, and Piggy J for a while which was cool.  Piggy was insane and wearing shorts.  Then he kept asking Tyke for the blanket that was smartly accompanying Tyke and keeping him warm.  But Tyke politely declined everytime.  After a while all of the ladies came.  Dotti, Haras, Tina, Purdy, Mandy, Tig, etc.  So they talked for a while.  And Haras gave Tyke some stoned crackers which tasted really good and Tina talked to Tyke about her gross-out things and Dotti and Tyke talked about his hectic day.  It was pretty much heaven.  A very cold heaven.  But then Tyke had to go to the hospital to pick up his dad's car cuz it was there and he couldn't drive.  So he went back to his house and Dotti came and picked him up.  They drove down to Bellevue and had a great talk.  It was really really great and Tyke didn't want it to stop.  But Tyke's mom called as they were about to get on 405 and said that they couldn't pick up the car anyway.  So they had to turn around and go back to Tyke's house.  But they still got to keep talking and that was extremely enjoyable.  After getting home they went in Tyke's house and chatted it up there for a while.  Then Tyke's parents got home at about 11 and they went upstairs and talked to them for a little.  Tyke's dad seemed pretty good considering he had surgery a little while ago.  So he is fine.  But then Dotti left and Tyke and his mom talked about their plans for tomorrow and filling up Tyke's brother's car's gas tank and picking up Tyke's dad's car and going out to Redmond again for some costume things and then going to Dotti's at 11:50 for Activity A of Tolo.  So Tyke will be getting up before 9 to do all of that.  Man, this is a crazy time right now.  But it is fun.  A lot of good things happening.  And nothing that is that bad.  So wow, Tyke needs to get some sleep.  This is just weird.

      So today was another day.  Thursday in fact.  A pretty good day.  1st period was pretty gay.  About a 6 out of 10 on the gay scale.  And for a comparison, Macaroon is a 10.  Oh, Tyke just couldn't resist.  But in all seriousness...yeah, there isn't much of this that is in all seriousness.  However, it was cool just breezing through the last full day of school periods today.  Lunch involved the entire crew going to FSM which was pretty good.  Then 5th period (or lunch #2) involved Tyke walking a little bit and talking to Dotti about Tolo and the librarian and such and then just going to his car and listening to music until Purdy came.  Then he went over to her car and they listened to Coldplay and talked.  Once again they were late to Physics despite running to class but it was only like 6 seconds so it wasn't that bad.  Oh hey, Haras just signed on.  Hey Haras.  But then after school Tyke and Skippy went to the Philosophy Society meeting.  Only for the Yearbook picture though.  There were some good poses.  He might go back next week as well.  After that Tyke and Skippy drove to Fred Meyer's to drop off Skippy's car and then they went to Redmond for some Tolo shopping for Tyke.  They went to Value Village.  And that store is just soo much fun to shop around.  Skippy got two great shirts with the Microsoft shirt being the best.  'IHS 91 We're Outta Here!'  That shirt is great also.  Tyke got a shirt that he is going to wear to school tomorrow but he didn't really see anything that he was dying to get like he sometimes sees.  He got a trenchcoat, a vest, and some pants as well.  His outfit sorta sucks so far.  It might not even be the 20s.  But he hasn't had much time to shop and he didn't get to pick what decade he was going to be in either.  The 20s is kinda hard.  Actually, it really isn't but Tyke isn't trying hard enough.  But shopping was fun and the pals drove back on East Lake Sammamish and they saw quite a wickedly awesome sight.  They were driving back and Skippy said he saw some smoke floating through the air down the road.  A couple seconds later Tyke saw it too.  Then they looked up by it and all of a sudden there was this huge flash and flames and sparks shooting everywhere.  It was soooo surreal.  A tree limb had fallen into the two power lines next to the road.  The initial flash was so bright that Tyke still saw it in his eyes as he was driving on.  But nonetheless it was one of the coolest things Tyke has seen in quite some time.  Tyke and Skippy went to Costco for a hot dog and broom trip and then back to Tyke's house for a few minutes.  Then down to the school for poker night.  That was fun.  Tyke played pretty well at first but got a little careless and made some bad calls before finally being taken out by a girl.  It was kinda dumb cuz when the people who had experience were playing those without experience they weren't really winning.  Cuz people didn't fold when you "should" and they couldn't be bluffed either so it was just a bunch of silly games.  Not to take anything away from any of the participants though.  And it was all for fun.  Which it was a lot of.  The pizza was good too.  Tyke stayed around for a while after losing and just chatted it up.  He played at the same table as Tina too which was fun.  But then he came home and had to take out the trash in the pouring rain.  Tomorrow is going to be fun though cuz Tyke is going to wear his new 99 cent shirt and there is an assembly schedule so that too is awesome.  Then lacrosse at night.  Looking to be a good day for Tyke.  No tests either.  :)  Grrr...this is an update.  Tyke has been pleasantly notified by Haras that Tyke does have a test tomorrow.  Not to mention some homework he "should" do tonight.  Physics triumphs once again.  Except this triumph is not a good one.  Stupid learning.

      So today involved a lot of things.  And it was fun.  One of the best Wednesdays in quite some time.  School was pretty boring and lunch was actually kinda bad just because they didn't end up going to Subway but Tyke ended up going there for dinner so it turned out alright.  Well after school Tyke went home for about an hour.  That was fine as he just ate some and then he went over to Purdy's house.  He tried on a suit that her grandfather wore and it was weird.  It was a hella tight suit but the pants were much too short (which made them look cool) and then the waist was so big that it fell off of Tyke's waist and down his legs (but don't forget that Tyke is insanely skinny).  So then Ekul came over and they hung out for a few minutes before going out to Redmond for some shopping.  Purdy drove but Tyke pulled the old 4-5 move (ya know how there's a 1-2? well this is the 4-5) with Tyke driving from the passenger seat.  Purdy seemed to enjoy at times not having to drive other than the gas/brake.  It's tough to drive a long way from the passenger side though.  But it's still fun.  They first went to Value Village and Tyke and Ekul were in heaven.  There was just so much sick stuff there.  Like Tyke probably should have just bought a bunch of things to wear to school from there.  Damn, he wishes he did now.  Maybe tomorrow he will though.  Purdy had to keep the guys under control because there was so much cool stuff.  And there were these two costume coordinators or something like that there and they talked to Tyke and Ekul for a little as they looked at sweet hats.  After they went to Value Village they went over to another costume shop which was pretty cool.  Tyke and Ekul kept talking about what was back in the 1920s.  Like gorillas, and chain mail, and bunnies.  Pretty much everything.  But not buses.  Or were there?  Does anybody know if there were buses in the 1920s?  At first Tyke said there were but then he realized (with Purdy's aid) that there might not have been.  But anyway, Tyke would just like to have confirmation either way.  After the costume shop they went over to American Eagle and the Booty Patrol was there.  Then they went to Subway for dinner and then to Jet City at the school.  Jet City was quite funny as usual.  Tyke is not nearly good enough at improv to be able to do that.  He doesn't think he could keep coming up with new stuff all the time.  But he likes doing it.  So Tyke's main quest now is to find a really good Tolo outfit for the 1920s.  That should be fun.  And a hat is necessary.  Hey, this blog really doesn't quantify the amount of fun Tyke had today.  But it would be pretty hard to do.  Grrrr...there is so much Tyke wants to say right now.  But nobody to tell it to.  There's just a lot of stuff Tyke wants to get off his chest and pretty much whine about.  It's just he can't.  Well he can but he doesn't think he should.  Do you know what that's like?  It is really difficult to know something but just have to hold to it.  And what's worse is the fact that there is nothing that Tyke can do about it.  It isn't something that is fixable.  Arrrgghhh...Tyke's mom is home.  Maybe she knows of some things for his tolo outfit.  Bye bye.

      Not sleeping is not a good idea.  Tyke is very sleepy right now.  He has gotten about 10 hours of sleep the past two days and he is pretty damn tired.  He has been sleeping for much of this Tuesday night.  During the day he really wasn't tired though.  Pretty awake in fact.  Classes were pretty stupid and useless but they had their moments.  All in all school is a waste for Tyke now.  His math teacher talked to him about his last test and it was normal for the entire class but she was just saying how he should come in and get help and Tyke just said, "Yeah, maybe."  Then she said that he really should and asked him if he would so he replied again with, "Yeah, maybe."  She finally took the hint though that Tyke is definitely not coming in.  The worst part of today was just having to drag himself from class to class.  Lunch was great.  They went to JIB and took Tyke's brother's car.  Dr. Phil and Amed liked the ride and of course the music.  Dr. Phil surprised Tyke with the fact that he was not against any of the songs that Tyke played.  So the rest of the week will be filled with sweet tunes and a sweet ride.  Sweet.  Tyke played more ESPN after school and that was fun.  But he got really sleepy doing so.  He basically fell asleep after playing.  Then woke up and watched some of the FLAM-LEHIGH game on ESPN.  Then he had dinner.  Then he fell asleep again.  Then he woke up and got online a little.  Then he just sat there.  And sat.  And almost fell asleep.  Then woke up from his daze.  Then kept sitting.  And finally decided to do a half-ass blog to keep him awake.  And it has worked.  But it isn't interesting so it is time to call it quits.  Good luck with stuff.

      Whoo!  How good it feels to have no constraints when blogging.  Sure Tyke is going to be extremely tired but tonight has been a great, albeit short, night.  The day was interesting.  School was mostly taken by Tyke's physics labs.  But both the individual and group labs got done 5th period.  "Well before they were due" as his dad said about them being due 6th period.  And they are both decent so hopefully everything will be good enough to help out Tyke's waning grade.  Who knows in that class.  Well, Tyke got home and pretty much just got to working on his new mixes.  He downloaded 33 songs and added another .1 GB of music to the hard drive.  There is now 3.14 GB of music on the computer upstairs.  And it is good shit too.  The theme to this mix is the 1970s.  It all started when on Sunday Tyke saw an infomercial about this Time Life collection of the hits of the 70s.  Tyke just copied down the titles to songs that were shown on there that he liked and then he made a nice long list.  After school Tyke just started dling them and thought of some other good ones too.  But all in all he downloaded 33 songs for his 2 cd mix.  76 minutes of music on the first CD and 74 on the second.  18 songs on the first, 15 on the second.  It is a fun mix to listen to.  Dr. Phil most likely won't like many songs but Amed and Kinker should.  Amed will like many and Tyke believes that Kinker should like a lot of them because he has a pretty good taste in music.  As does Amed.  The cds were finally done about 6ish and Tyke then listened to them for a little before settling down for dinner.  His brother had come home for the night as he is leaving tomorrow morning for D.C. to look at some of his options for law school and also to go back to see some of the touristy stuff there.  He hasn't been there since Tyke's family went the summer after 7th grade.  It was a good trip.  Tyke's bro isn't going to Georgetown but he doesn't know about like George Washington yet.  Tyke had some good lasagna for dinner but he didn't like the spinach ravioli.  Tyke doesn't like spinach so the normally good item of ravioli was spoiled by the normally bad item of spinach.  And since Tyke's bro drove himself home but is going to be gone all week Tyke gets to take his car.  So he will be driving the other Volv tomms.  It will be fun.  Exciting even.  Later on after dinner Tyke and his bro played ESPN for a while.  It was quite fun.  They listened to Tyke's mixes as well.  Time just flew and it was 9 by the time they quit.  Then Tyke ate some more and now has blogged.  It is nice not having to do homework again.  That one day of it was hell.  Just plain hell.  Tyke did his laundry today as well so he has a bunch of clean clothes to wear, mainly boxers and socks so that makes Tyke in a better mood as well.  So tomorrow Tyke will be driving a nice car and maybe doing some Tolo shopping/looking.  He sorta needs to as ya know, it's in 4 days.  No hurry though.  He just needs it by like what, 4ish?  Heh, first time Tyke trekked to Tolo.  Total alliteration.

      This is hardly a blog.  Perhaps the shortest ever.  But Tyke is quite busy tonight and doesn't need to be distracted by his blog.  He got up and has worked on Physics basically all day while watching some college and pro hoops along with the selection tourney.  Kinker came over twice to work on the lab and it is decent.  It has its funny parts which is always good.  Tyke went to Refuge at night with Dotti and a few of her friends.  And Tyke talked to Ekul for a little.  But mainly Tyke has spent his day with Physics.  And is not that near being done.  He is going back now to work more on it and try and get it semi-completed.  So that is how bad his day has been.  He did fall asleep on a chair for a while though.  And then Kinker came over while he was asleep.  That was funny.  Damn physics labs.  This one is a serious stinker.  Ok, here goes Tyke.  Think happy about him.

      No need to blog a lot about today.  Not that it wasn't blogworthy as today was one of the most blogworthy days in a while.  As was yesterday.  But the thing is, when Tyke has a really good blog day he is in the worst mood to do the blogging.  Tiredness and varying moods are the two main contributors to this feeling.  It's kinda funny though how Tyke really isn't that tired right now.  He was sorta quasi-tired at Dotti's tonight but he just felt like closing his eyes a lot and not really opening them.  But let's go back.  Tyke got up and hung out with himself all day downstairs.  Watched some TV, played some games, didn't do some Physics.  Ya know, just cool stuff.  Then at 5 he left for Dotti's where some people met up for dinner for part IV or so of Purdy's birthday bash.  Tyke drove with Tina and Tig as they went to California Pizza Kitchen.  It was fun and good.  Then they went back to Issaquah and picked up some more people before heading off to Renton for broom ball.  It was wicked fun.  It is a really cool game.  You play on an ice rink with a ball a little bigger than a softball and this stick that has a weird pointed plastic end to it so it is a little like a shaved broom.  Then you just run around on the ice trying to score.  And you fall a lot.  But Tyke only fell twice he thinks.  Once he just fell on his knees and that hurt a little cuz ice is hard and the other time he just kinda wiped out but his hands sorta got scraped because of the ice.  But considering, he hardly ever fell.  He was a very good defensive player in his mind.  Offense wasn't his game.  Defense was.  And he was a damned good goalie.  After the game they went back to Dotti's and watched When Harry Met Sally.  That part wasn't that fun but it was cool being with Dotti (who finally asked Tyke to tolo today just to let you know).  So that is great.  But yeah, just so that you know what Tyke is talking about, Tyke is looking forward to college and new experiences more and more.  Cuz lying on the ground by yourself isn't fun.  Lying on the ground with Dotti is fun.  Alone is not.  You know where this goes.  Nothing that hasn't been said before.

      So today was good.  Another super Saturday.  Tyke went over to Dotti's at 6 and a bunch of people were there.  Tyke and Tina came in and Piggy J was already in Dotti's room.  Then Ekul came, and Elyk, and Purdy, and Macaroon, and Skippy, and Karla, and Dudely Doo, and Haras, and Kramm, and Amyazing, and that is all of the people who have names or are easy enough to make a semi-decent name for on the spot (i.e. Elyk).  Broom ball was pretty good again.  The game was a blowout.  Tyke was with Ekul, and Purdy, and Tina, and Macaroon, and Elyk, and Piggy J, and Dotti, and they pwned.  It was such a blowout.  Tyke was of course the goalie because he is extremely good.  He was 1st team All-State goalie.  Ekul was 1st team All-State defense.  Elyk was 1st team All-State forward.  Macaroon was 2nd team All-State midfield.  Tina was honorable mention All-State midfield.  And Purdy was honorable mention All-State forward.  The team was stacked.  Tyke kept the shutout and they won 11-0.  It was awesome.  Tyke used his insane soccer skills as goalie and didn't let anything in.  He now has a very swollen left ankle from one time when he kicked clear the ball and it was a hard ball and it hit his ankle and it hurts pretty bad now.  But he is tough.  He can take it.  After broom ball they went back to Dotti's and watched Aladdin and the Tolo video again.  In the tv room there was quite a showing for Tyke.  In that one room there were 4 different girls that Tyke has at one point felt quite strongly about.  He of course noticed that while sitting there.  Thinking about things.  Tyke often is with at least one girl he has had strong feelings for but 4 is pretty high.  4 doesn't even do it justice because some of those girls he has liked multiple times or for a long time consecutively (how odd does that sound??) so it is really more like 7-8 girls.  It wasn't very weird though.  But it does kinda suck being with couples all the time and watching a quasi-romantic movie.  It's better than being alone by far but when Tyke would rather be the guy that is with the girl than the guy who is adjacent to the guy with the girl, it is a little harder.  Feelings are much more apparent when jealousy is mixed in.  Sometimes Tyke doesn't really know how he feels about someone until he sees what he wants to be doing.  That sounds a little unhealthy and it makes it sound like jealousy is fueling everything but it at least gets the point across.  Tyke doesn't like to think of himself as a jealous person but then again he must be.  For he has never truly had a reason to be jealous because he is always jealous of the boyfriend.  So it isn't like he is the boyfriend and he is jealous of another guy.  Then it is worse but it at least the guy has something to lose while Tyke has nothing to lose so he has nothing to be jealous of.  Just longing.  Tyke's favorite "L" word.  Longing.  Well, favorite as in used frequently and fits Tyke to a "T" (whatever that stems from).  Sometimes it is hard being a respectable, well-liked, social, emotional, touchy, single teenage boy.  Because to this stage Tyke has no memories of anything.  Karla is his closest kiss but that is a funny story that you have most likely heard before and you can ask Tyke about it sometime if you haven't heard it but all Tyke knows is hugs.  Which is why he is always wanting a hug.  And he never wants to leave somewhere without saying goodbye and a hug.  Which makes it disappointing if that doesn't happen.  Especially cuz Tyke realizes that everytime he says goodbye to someone it could be the last time so he wants to make sure that he does say goodbye.  And a hug is meaningful to Tyke.  It shows that you care.  Because a lot of people aren't huggers (either in general or just to Tyke) so that makes it more special other times.  So Tyke knows what he is looking for in a girl (mainly cuz he has found so much of what he wants in a certain girl) so he knows what he wants.  And he used to really be looking forward to college to finding that girl, or any girl to start with.  But now he is more reserved about that.  Because college will be much different than high school.  He just wants to stay in high school for now but be able to find a girl that can satisfy some of his needs.  And not be a source of angst for Tyke either (e.g. have a boyfriend).  Just a lot of wishing and longing for something that can't be changed.  It either will happen or it won't.  It will either happen now or later or never.  You're either bluffing or you're not.  That pretty much sums it up.  Tyke tried to leave it on a bit of an up note.  Thanks.

      Ah yes, today was awesome.  Not because Tyke did anything special but just because it was Friday.  How can you not like almost every Friday ever?  They are just the greatest things.  Today was carried over from last night's late night partying and Tyke slept until about 11:30 which really was way before Tyke was expecting to get up.  So he is pretty tired now.  He got about 9 and a half hours.  Which for Tyke isn't that much.  He could sleep much more.  When he got up he set up a bball game at the Comm Center.  Tyke, Skippy, Piggy J, DCups, Jew, Jeu, all played along with others as well.  Tyke was on fire as usual.  He owns at the comm cent.  He dominated when he tried and his team never lost in fact no matter who was on it.  Not to brag, but Tyke was playing well.  Piggy J brought his littlest brother and he played some and on one play Jew just let him drive then came up and just absolutely swatted the shot out of the air.  It was hilarious!  There were quite a few fun plays.  Tyke had another good dunk attempt.  He went up and missed the dunk but he thinks he actually dunked it.  It was like when an NBA player goes up for a dunk (or a college player like the one who missed a dunk for Kansas today) and they can easily dunk but they miss it and it bounces off the back rim and out.  That is how Tyke dunked it.  Pretty good for him.  He was excited.  Or maybe he made it.  Now he is thinking he made it.  Hmmm...he knows he didn't dunk it but...oh whatever.  Tyke's probably the only one who cares about his dunking escapades.  But it was fun nonetheless.  Afterwards Tyke came home and that was his day.  Well he went to South Cove to drop off Team Jeu and then he drove around there for a little to see if anyone he was friends with was out.  Purdy wasn't home he doesn't think and he didn't feel like calling Tina even though he saw her car outside her house.  So Tyke went home.  He watched bball and ate and played PS2 and then his dad came home with KFC.  So he ate that.  And it was good.  Tyke and Kinker played poker online at night and they dominated.  Kinker really owned though.  He was up so much.  Tyke still had about 14k in his pocket when he left.  Oh yeah, play money.  Not real.  Tyke is still under age anyway.  Not Kinker.  He's old.  He's like 30.  He's gonna need a cane to walk with soon cuz he's so old.  Tyke is listening to 'All by Myself' right now.  That's such a good song.  It is so him.  And the song isn't so much sad and whining about being by himself (although really it is) but it's just like "don't wanna be all by myself!"  Yeah, don't worry bout Tyke, stuff's fun.  But...nah, we'll leave it at that.  Tomorrow is going to be great.  Broom ball is the best!  If you wanna play and you haven't been approached to play let Tyke know.  He'll most likely let you play ;).  Ok, now people can read this (except they already read it by this point) and go to bed cuz Tyke is done!

      Ok, so it's 1:30 and yet it feels like about 12.  It really doesn't feel late at all.  According to Dr. Phil though, it isn't.  Today was pretty cool.  The school day was incredibly long but just talking with Purdy, Amed, Dotti, Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Kinker, Piggy J, and Haras made it all worthwhile.  And so did the nightlife.  After school Tyke came home and took out the garbage.  Then he played ESPN.  At about 7:30 the boys came over.  Macaroon and then Kinker that is.  Tyke was down 2-0 in Shithead games but somehow he came back to win the series 3-2.  Then he kept his roll going by not losing 5 more consecutive games and thus taking his streak to 8 straight.  Which is very impressive with only 3 people playing.  The odds are he will lose once.  And he beat the odds.  So they played that for a while.  And watched some of the real March Madness.  Then DCups and Team Jeu came over for poka.  It was fun.  $5 buy-ins unlimitedly.  Tyke only put 5 in the pot and he played very well all night.  Played the right hands.  And he came out with 21 bucks.  A very nice night indeed.  Dr. Phil joined the fray late but he wasn't a winner.  Tyke, Kinker, and fake jew all won money with fake coming out with about 30.  It was a great time though.  Then, on a spurge of the moment decision the gang decided to go down to Denny's.  So Tyke snuck out at about 12:20 and left his back door open so he could get back in without making noise.  They went to Denny's and got some grub and it was good.  The service was bad as usual but there was this one chick that was pretty hot and Tyke and DCups could not figure out why she was working at Denny's for the midnight shift.  She should have been working somewhere non-Denny's like.  Not like Hooters but just something more respectable than Denny's.  No offense intended really but still.  She was pretty.  And she spoke English so that wasn't it.  It was quite a canundrum.  But Tyke should probably go to bed.  So he will.  This kind of night would be fun to have on an actual school day.  Maybe that day will come sometime this year.  But now sleep comes.

      Another day in the short week is gone but a tradition has died as well.  Unfortunately, Tyke will be driving his own car again.  His dad is going back to work so Tyke is forced to go back to the Volvo.  It will be a sentimental return but hopefully some good times will come back.  It is easy to drive that car at least.  Just not good speakers or speed.  Or smooth.  Or pretty.  Or warm.  Or...you get the picture.  But tomorrow is the last day of the school week which means that at night Tyke can do stuff.  That is going to be fun, if he does something fun.  But he has now joined Dr. Phil in having two groups of friends in a way.  For Doc P it is whites and asians and for Tyke it is IHS and SHS.  Even though the SHS aren't as exclusive as the asians are, it is pretty similar.  Well today was pretty easy.  Tyke got to play basketball second period.  He even played bump for the first time in years.  That was quite fun actually.  But 3rd period was just a chatting period.  4th was short.  Lunch was fine.  5th involved working in that class!!!!.  Amazing really.  He didn't even have to but he still did.  And he did shoddy work as usual so that's no surprise.  6th period was fun.  Those demonstrations are just really cool.  The optics and all of these things are really interesting.  Eye-catching indeed.  After school Tyke got gas for the Avalon, returned a movie, and got a few groceries.  The last time he gets to drive the Lon for a while.  Afterwards Tyke came home, ate, watched Full House, and played ESPN.  At dinner his family had a talk about the physics of baseball which was very intellectual.  Then Tyke did nothing for the rest of the night.  But his computer is still very messed up.  He did get to talk to Haras online and she loved his new buddy icon.  Tyke has been waiting for somebody to mention the icon.  Kinker has and now Haras too.  Tyke thinks this one really gets his personality well.  Hopefully tomorrow night will be fun.  Who knows, something cool could happen.  ;).

      Yet another Wednesday is approaching.  Yet another extended sleep session is awaited.  Dude, today was even blander than yesterday.  Hardly anything exciting happened.  During 5th period the sub took attendance a few times at least, Tyke was only there for the first one but it probably isn't a problem just cuz Tyke is the man and he can't get in trouble.  Especially since he has to start working in there again cuz his teacher shouldn't be gone for a while.  Damn, that sucks.  Tyke is gonna die if he can't just walk around school all day.  5th period has been awesome.  Tyke walked around and found himself by Kinker's class for a while.  He talked to Kinker and a few junior girls before heading off to his car.  Then he waited for Purdy and they sat in her car before heading off to Physics and talking there.  And drawing her "pi" vein.  Then Tyke had to go to Redmond to return his fedora from Tolo.  But that was actually a little fun cuz Tyke listened to great music on the great system in the Avalon.  He had the sun roof open on the drive there but it started to drizzle (and get inside the car again) on the way back so he had to close it.  Tyke once again got nice and cozy and noticed that he could fall asleep if he didn't start focusing more so he changed to some good pump-up songs and he was fine.  It is so easy to just fall asleep driving.  When Tyke was little he had no idea how easy it is.  And today it was broad daylight when Tyke got sleepy.  But the Avalon is just soo nice.  So smooth.  So luxurious.  So musically enhanced.  Just heaven.  Minus all of the freaking hot chicks.  So basically it is totally not heavenly.  But it is not hellish.  Somewhere in the middle.  Leaning towards the heaven side though.  But not quite.  Almost.  A little off.  Not too much.  But not too little.  Juuuust right.  Zzzzzzzz...Click.  Yep.  Tyke didn't fall asleep at home today.  And he worked on his baller a lot too.  Kinker is very good.  Almost perfect now.  That is fun.  Fun stuff.  No homework done either.  Funner stuff.  Fun fun.  Bye bye.  Tyke writes this topless.  After he was calling a game and season of basketball while he played on his hoop downstairs.  Tyke Turner had an awesome season.  29 PPG, 5 APG, 8 RPG, 2.9 SPG, 1.6 BPG, 44 MPG.  All were said in Tyke's discussion of himself.  It was a good game.  But he lost the NBA Finals despite having 2 buzzer beating shots to win games in the first playoff round, 1 in the second round, and 2 in the finals.  But he couldn't win the last game.  He led the Cavaliers to a great season in which they didn't win a single game by more than 9 points but never lost one by more than 9 either.  They were a very even-keel team led by Tyke and Lebron.  Yeah, everything Tyke just wrote he said in his playing.  That is how detailed Tyke gets.

      Man, the computer sure is producing some trippy combinations of colors on the monitor.  It is psychadelic.  Today was kinda weird in a way.  At least the weather was.  Waking up today was nice because it was sunny out and very bright.  It seemed like a Wednesday morning it was so light out.  And it was pretty warm too.  The day was bland by blog standards (which have dropped considerably) but there were a few memorable moments.  Lunch time was great because it was so nice out and they went out to Pie for a splendid meal.  Then was 5th period.  With a sub.  The sub was taking attendance and Tyke waited til his name was called and was walking to the door as she said it.  He said here and then walked right out the door.  He turned back to tell Macaroon to meet him at his car at 12:45 and then left.  He made a little walk around and then met up with some pals who walked out to the parking lot and talked there for about 15 minutes or so.  Then Amed and Macaroon came out and they joined Tyke in his car.  They both left and it was just Tyke for a while.  He listened to his 70s mix and waited for Purdy.  It was so pleasant just sitting there with the window down, the sun roof back and the sun shining down with a side breeze blowing him softly.  It was so nice out he left the sun roof cracked and the window as well.  Damn that.  But after that he went over and talked with Purdy and then they walked to class together.  Physics was alright.  Long stories about things that don't seem to relate but then somewhat come together at the end.  Basically, a normal day.  After class Tyke walked outside and was shocked that the ground was wet.  Then he realized that he had left the sun roof open a little.  It didn't do much damage but there was a few drops of water inside.  No biggy.  But here's a funny story on stupidity or maybe not but probably.  Tyke got in the car and forced his way back so that he could back up and get out of the lot.  Well his car wouldn't turn after he shifted into drive.  So he kept trying and trying then he turned the car off.  Even if he was in drive he would go backwards but he had the e brake on when he turned the car off.  But then he tried to turn the car back on and couldn't.  He kept trying and trying but couldn't.  Piggy J had walked by and said that Tyke almost hit him when he was trying to back up but that wasn't on Tyke's mind.  The fact that his car wasn't working was a bit more concerning.  Well it took a while but then Piggy looked and laughed at Tyke that the car was in drive and that is why it wasn't starting.  So he put it in park and started it and then he went on his way as it worked fine.  Tyke still didn't know how the wheel wouldn't turn earlier but Tyke figures that he must not have turned the car on as it is a bit different to start the car than he has been used to.  So he must have only turned it on accessory and then the car just happened to roll backwards just like it would in reverse.  Who knows though.  Who knows.  It was pretty funny for observers and was pretty stupid at the time but that's ok.  The rain was more annoying really.  Stupid humid weather making it rain when Tyke was going to play some great bball with the guys.  But Tyke did get to work on his housing application for WSU.  His mom has gone to sleep so he didn't get it sent but now he only needs the credit card portion of the app.  So he is basically set for his next year of living.  Man, college is approaching deadly quick.  Yeesh.

      6 hours later Tyke is back and in full swing.  His computer is still totally messed up though.  It is starting to piss off Tyke.  All of the colors are effed up ("eff" was used by Kramm yesterday in his racer name for go-karting and Tyke liked it so he is using it a lot) and he just wants to see things normally again.  But today was pretty short again.  Since his last blog Tyke has sat around and watched tv and nursed a headache which is mostly gone now but still some remnants are around.  Tyke went to Refuge again tonight.  Dotti picked him up but he had a headache at that point and had one for a while during Refuge but it did go away after a while.  Tyke talked with some of the Sly Lion boys there.  He is becoming pretty good friends now with those guys.  And he is getting to know more of them too.  Which is cool cuz they are all cool.  He might even be in the same dorm as some of them at WSU.  That would be great.  Just hanging out with them is fun.  Good thing Dotti and Purdy and Haras hang out with both them and Tyke cuz those are fun times.  So pretty soon Tyke is...hmmm don't know where Tyke was going with this sentence.  That is pretty much all for today's 3rd blog entry.  Close to a record.  But not.  Cuz of that "one day."  You all probably remember that day.  Or at least you should if you are a long time blog-reader.  Which you should be.  Avalon tomorrow.

      Here is the real deal.  The Saturday blog coming at ya at 3:08 on Sunday afternoon.  And what a beautiful Sunday it is.  Downright warm out there.  But back to yesterday.  Man, that was a great day.  Tyke had to get up at 9:40 because he and his mom had some errands to run.  They went to Krispy Kreme and Starbucks before heading off to Redmond.  Tyke got his fedora for his Tolo outfit at a costume shop and then they left.  They had to go pick up Tyke's dad's car at Overlake Hospital after this.  Then Tyke went to Dotti's house but he got there early so he drove around South Cove for a while.  Then Dotti called him and said she wasn't going to be at her house but all of a sudden Tyke saw her drive by so he followed her to get gas.  Then they went to Sunset and met up with a bunch of the group and waited for the rest to finally come.  Tyke, Ekul, and Kramm formed The Outcasts by their own accord and that made for good times for the rest of the day.  As long as they were together then they were in good shape.  But Tyke was not in the same car as them so he was truly the outcast.  But it was still fun because Tyke and Dotti were together and the other two in the car were fine.  It could have been much worse.  The girls all got in their cars and drove the boys to Activity A which was kept secret from the guys.  Tyke made a guess on where they were going and as it turned out, he was right.  He definitely did not guess the exact place but he guessed the activity.  They went all the way out to Mukilteo for go-karting and other fun activities at this cool place.  Tyke did some rock climbing with Ekul and Purdy and Dotti got really high on the bouncy trampoline bungee jumping thingy.  That was fun but not even close to as fun as the go-karting.  Tyke had scouted out the track and cars with the other Outcasts earlier on and he decided he was going to go for car 6.  This car was probably the worst one out there but Tyke knew it.  Big Dog had been riding it (not a person anybody would know) and he certainly was a big dog.  But Tyke thought that if he could do well in that car then he could do well in anything.  Tyke had a little bit of trouble the first lap just getting used to the course.  It was a great course though.  There was a ramp that had a hill on it so you had to floor it going up the ramp in order to get over it.  But then when you hit the peak you immediately start going down so you get that rollercoaster feeling.  Which was not expected when Tyke first hit that part.  But Tyke had the third best lap time for his group so he did alright overall.  It was hella good times though.  After the long drive back home Tyke filled up his brother's car with gas and then he came home.  He got some nachos and dressed up in his outfit with the aid of his mom.  Then they took some pictures of him outside because it was such a gorgeous day and his parents weren't able to come to pictures at Haras' house.  Tyke left his house and went down to Dotti's to meet up with her.  They took a few pictures and then they went with her dad up to Haras' house.  Everybody met there and they took pictures with a bunch of the parents.  A lot of smiling and blinding flashes of course.  But the ladies all looked lovely in their flapper dresses and Tyke got to take pictures with a lot of them.  So it was fine.  Then they all left and some of the guys got blindfolded as they were secretly taken to their location for dinner.  Which ended up being Frederique's house.  They went to her garage which was made up kinda like a restaurant and had a jet engine basically heating it up.  The food was delightful.  The pasta was sooooo damn good.  Dotti's mom made it Tyke thinks.  It was incredible.  So they stayed there for a while before getting ready and leaving for the dance.  Tyke wasn't really pumped for the dance but it wasn't like he didn't want to go to it.  He just didn't think it would be the most fun part of the day, especially after go-karts.  The group got there and took their pictures and then went up to the dance.  Tyke became a dancing machine.  He was just making up insane dances and doing them.  He pretended like he was pulling a heavy rope that had something attached to it and then he saw the box and opened it and there was something inside it.  And it happened to be a cat...etc, etc.  Basically he was doing mime dancing.  But he enjoyed it.  And Dotti seemed to as well.  Tyke even danced with Tina that way for a while.  One of them would make up dance moves and the other one would do it right after.  It was a blast.  Of course the Outcasts stuck together as well though.  They stayed at the dance for a while.  Til about 11 and then they left.  They went to Frederique's again.  But first Tyke's car went to Dotti's and they changed.  Then Tyke and Dotti drove to Frederique's and they hung out in the restaurant/garage.  There was some delectible cheesecake there and Tyke devoured it.  It was a treat indeed.  Tyke talked with Dotti, Tina, Frederique, Ekul, Kramm, Haras, and Purdy.  Then everyone left and Tyke took Dotti home and came home himself.  It was about 12:40 when he got home so it wasn't that late really.  Then he got up at about 11 today and had to go to brunch at his cousin's house in South Cove because his aunt/uncle (no blood relation though) are moving to Florida now.  So they had a little going away thing.  It was pretty damn boring but that's ok.  Then Tyke came home and has been trying to find out what the hell is wrong with his computer.  Cuz something is definitely wrong.  The screen has lost the correct colors and the display is just really messed up.  Tyke can't wait til he gets to get his laptop for college.  Then things will be simpler.  However, Tyke won't just be able to download whatever the hell he wants cuz he has to be aware of viruses.  Unlike on the current computer where it is so "effed" up already that nothing worse could come of it.  Oh well.  Refuge, etc tonight.

      So today was Tolo.  And there is a lot to say.  And Tyke doesn't want to say it now.  So he will say it later on today.  But that is ok since it is after 1 AM and nobody should be reading this now anyway.

      Not a big blog time right now.  The post-school activites were fun though.  So Tyke will just detail those.  After school Tyke took Purdy home and then came back to the school.  He met up with Skippy and Karla and Dudely Doo (and others who don't actually have names yet but probably will at some point) and they tried to watch the cheer tryouts.  They had fun trying to devise ways in which they could watch it for free but they didn't get to be there for long.  So after a long time there the cheer tryouts finally ended.  Tyke talked with Haras and talked about doing the Swinging'n'Sweets thingy but he said he probably wouldn't come.  And he didn't but at least he was honest.  Anyway, a bunch of people went to Jamba Juice and that was fun.  Then they all left and Tyke went home for about 15 minutes before Skippy called to tell him where he was going out to dinner.  So Tyke went up to Skippy's house and picked him up to go to Bell Square and Red Robin.  They met up there and ate and then left.  At 8, Kinker, Skippy, Amed, Macaroon, Little Twigg, and Naan all came over.  They played cards and 10 fingers and song guessing and managed to have a pretty dang good time.  Then they went to Krispy Kreme and came back after that.  Everyone left then.  It was a really fun day.  Nothing like any of the past days had been like.  So today rocked.  And Tyke is tired/sicker than he was yesterday.  So he needs to get some sleep now for tomorrow is a busy day as well.  Here we go!

      So to start off Tyke is going to divulge some information that was going to be secret until the end of this blog.  But Tyke's plans changed.  He was going to do an April Fool's joke-blog where he made up this story of a girl he met Thursday night and hung out with and exchanged numbers with, etc.  He was going to be very detailed and intricate but still be fun and then give his readers some false beliefs.  Either he was going to do that or do a blog where he sets himself up as being suicidal and extremely depressed (which he could pull off pretty well in this hell week he has had).  He also decided not to do that.  Instead, he is just going to say what he has already said and say ha!  So that is pretty much what Tyke's joke was going to be.  He thought of it last night and thought it would be good.  But Tyke doesn't really feel in the mood to do so.  Nor has he been in the mood to do it for quite some time.  That's kind of interesting.  Tyke had a lot of fun at Refuge this past Sunday and he was very giddy then.  Excluding Sunday though, Tyke has not been very happy since Saturday evening.  Late night Saturday he wasn't as happy either.  So basically this week has been depressive.  Not exactly sure that 'depressive' is a word-most likely isn't-but it was used strategically to convey his message.  Not depressed, not depressing, just depressive.  Like it could be depressing if it got worse.  Which it won't.  It's just another phase.  Which is kind of random to Tyke.  He really doesn't know why he has been so down this week.  It's not like this week is that different from any other.  Tyke has had to do a little bit more homework than usual but that isn't that big of a deal.  He knows what is making him sad but it isn't like he hasn't always felt that way.  For some reason it is taking it's toll on Tyke this week.  Being sick and not of healthy body must have some effect on his mind.  It is just annoying mostly.  Oh, and Tyke has also missed something for the last 2 days but he hopes to get it tomorrow.  At least once.  Let's see.  What was fun today?  Sanders (yeah, using her name for once) said poop.  It was funny.  Then Tyke kept saying poop.  Poop poop poop.  Tyke was the King in english.  He was drifting asleep after he thought he was done with his lines for the day but then he opened his book a bit as they began to read again and he realized all of a sudden that he was supposed to be reading.  So he jumped in and read.  That woke him up.  It caught him by surprise to say the least.  Actually had to stay in class 5th period for most of the day again.  That was too bad.  Did go to the bathroom though at one point.  That was a great #1.  It felt really good.  Just like the one Tyke just took.  Mmmm...good feelings.  Today is the first day of April.  Which means only 2 more months of school...after this month that is.  But yeah, that is not going to take that long either.  Which is just a mixed bag of emotions.  But you all know what that is like so no need to talk about that topic here.  This is just for brand new topics of conversation.  Yeah, right.  What a great title for a play/musical/opera/whatever the hell it is.  Les Miserables.  Less Miserables.  Tyke would like to be that right now.  Less miserables than he is now.  Ok, only one way to change that, at least that Tyke can do on his own.  And that is to eat.  Eat a lot.  And then just poop it out later.  Poop poop poop.

      Everything seems different after watching the OC.  As you can tell from the blatantly obvious intro, Tyke just watched the OC and it changed his mood.  To change the subject for now, Wednesdays continued to be nice.  Today was pretty much a breeze.  Nothing even worth mentioning really.  Which is fine with Tyke.  After school was ok.  Stayed after for about 49 seconds and then went home.  He left after about 10 minutes at home and went to Factoria to get pictures taken for his passport.  It is fun getting all of this stuff done.  Then they went to Gottschalks for his mom and Tyke got some socks (he's excited to wear them tomorrow tee-hee-hee).  Then they went to the fabric store by Farget and got some dinner at Teriyaki Bistro.  Came home and ate that well.  It tasted good.  Then he played some ESPN and shot some downstairs hoops.  Oh, Tyke just went away but Amed was saying something to him online.  Then he closed the window.  Sorry bout that.  Tyke doesn't have strep throat to answer that question but his throat still does hurt a little bit.  The rest is just some cold stuff.  And yeah, things aren't perfect in Tyke land.  It's one of those situations where...damn, this is really hard.  It's something Tyke wants to talk about on here but he knows he has to be careful because of past times.  It should now be obvious at least about what Tyke is hinting at though.  But this is a really tough thing to talk about.  And the times at which Tyke most wants to talk about it, he talks about it the least.  Which isn't enjoyable.  Why this happens is because Tyke gets too busy and then wants to get some sleep so he decides to stop himself.  But it just makes him think about it more.  It's probably about time for a Dr. Phil Lelee chat.  Those are usually pretty helpful.  They at least give Tyke some good feedback.  Amed chats sometimes give some good feedback.  But they don't match Dr. Phil's.  Nonetheless, Tyke can't do anything about his situation.  That has always been the worst part of Tyke's life.  He really wants there to be something he can do.  But there has never been anything that would help.  And as you have read before, he tried.  To no avail.  That has been the result from all of his attempts.  Even dating back to elementary school where things were really much simpler.  The girls didn't really have boyfriends back then and Tyke only had a limited supply to pick from (poor use of words there).  But now everything seems so much more complicated.  And if Tyke reads this in 10 years he will think he was being a stupid jackass.  Well, probably not that but he will most likely laugh this off.  This must be what adults in movies and TV and all that mumbo-jumbo mean when they say that high school is a bunch of drama.  Tyke doesn't think that he has drama in his life for most of the day but then at night he just feels like he is too caught up in the moment to realize it.  At night he has hindsight.  And hindsight is always 20-20.  In reality it is just way too complex for anything to work right at this stage.  And waiting sucks.  Waiting is so very hard.  Maybe it is easier because Tyke hasn't had a relationship in the past that he is waiting to have again.  But Tyke feels it is harder because Tyke doesn't really even know what he is missing out on.  Because maybe if Tyke knew, he wouldn't be missing it so much.  He would realize that his imagination isn't really what it is.  But that doesn't seem right.  It can't be right.  T.Y.K.E.  Troubled Young Kid Everyday.

      Yeah, are you serious indeed!  AYSI!!!  Today wasn't that exciting of a day.  It started off terribly.  Tyke woke up at 5:58 today and noticed his throat was extremely sore.  Extremely.  He thought about, for the first time all year really, staying home from school.  He knew he wasn't going to but this was one of the worst he has felt all year.  In his car after he parked in the lot at school he just leaned back and nearly fell asleep before school started.  He got to that point where he suddenly realized he was falling asleep and he knew he had to go to school.  How funny would that have been if Tyke was late to first period cuz he fell asleep in his car in the parking lot.  That would be a great story to tell.  Speaking of sleeping in the parking lot, Tyke's 1st period teacher is going to be gone all week after spring break so Tyke is trying to devise a way that he can pull a 5th period, 1st period.  Just skip.  He would like to be able to just sleep in an extra hour and then not even come to 1st period at least one day but he doesn't think he'll be able to do that.  But if he does, he could hang out with Purdy when she gets to school for 2nd period.  It would be just like 5th period but earlier in the day and colder.  Well 5th period today was like 5th periods of old.  Tyke got to skip.  He walked in with his backpack on, saw the sub, turned around, dropped his backpack off outside the door, went back in, did attendance, left.  It was great.  He walked around and talked to 2 fine blog-nameless ladies that he is seeing and talking to all the time now and then he continued his journey.  Went out to his car with Macaroon for a little but it was gameday so Macaroon decided to play it safe and go back to class after a few minutes.  Tyke waited for Purdy and they went to Physics.  Oh yeah, Tyke barely said a word until 2nd period today.  That's how sick he felt.  Pretty sick.  His throat hurts quite a bit but it is a weird feeling.  If he eats a lot it makes him feel better.  The more he swallows stuff, the better it feels.  And not that Amed-style of swallowing.  Yeah, you know what kind of swallow techniques Tyke's talking about.  Nudge nudge.  JIB lunch.  Good food and it is fun talking with Amed and Doc P about stuff.  It is a great way to spend lunchtime.  Well after school Tyke took some sleep and went to some soccer game at IHS.  It was a fun time even though the guys lost.  They got quite screwed though.  Quite.  They didn't play all that well but the refs had to be joking.  One of them was.  But really, how could they be serious?  It was a joke.  And not a funny one.  Kinda like a teacher joke.  It's supposed to be funny but it has no comic value at all.  Poor delivery is a big part.  These refs sucked.  Speaking of sucking...nope, can't transition that into going to bed without making it gay.  But Tyke just did actually.  Sort of.  Zzzzzzzz...

      Wow, today was absolutely stunning.  Hot indeed.  It was so great.  Unfortunately, it is not going to last.  That is a little bit depressing but that's ok.  Tomorrow will be fine nonetheless.  It sucks that Tyke is a little sick right now.  He has a sore throat.  Hopefully it isn't strep.  Everytime Tyke begins to get a sore throat he fears strep because he has gotten it so many times.  And it always comes on slowly like it is just a sore throat but then quickly hits him and he is dead.  A sore throat is just killer.  You almost always notice it because of its pervasive nature.  Damn you throat.  Why does Tyke have to swallow?!?!!  Man, it was so hot out today.  It was gorgeous.  It is on these days that Tyke really wishes he had a sun roof for it would have gotten immense usage with Tyke driving quite a bit today.  Lunch at Pie was hot and they sat outside on one of the benches with Dotti and Purdy as they went there as well as the regular crew.  In 6th period they burned stuff and went outside and that was just about all.  After school Tyke picked up Jew and went to Amed's for some bball.  They were joined by Maniak and the gang took on some Asians from Newport.  They won half the time.  The Asians were pretty good but really they weren't that smart for having more skill than Tyke.  Tyke knew the game better so he used that to his advantage.  But they still could school Tyke with the dribble on occasion and had more strength and size down low.  It was a good match though.  And a great time under the sun.  Tyke went home and later on he had to go out and get his own dinner as his parents were gone.  He drove to Taco Time on the plateau by himself and then drove back and ate it at home by himself.  And he listened to his completed 80s mix.  It is not up to Tyke's usual standards for a mix but it is still good.  And some good humorous songs are on there so it is enjoyable nonetheless.  You can hear it sometime.  Making cds takes a while and is boring.  Oh well, music is life.  Tyke is definitely a music junkie.  So tomorrow is Tuesday.  Then...WEDNESDAY!!!!

      Sunday Sunday.  Today was another bland day until about 7:15.  Tyke got some mail yesterday and he opened it today and apparently he was picked to be a rep for prom tuxes.  So that's pretty sick.  Cuz now he can get his for pretty cheap.  So if you want a discount on your tux come to Tyke and he will hook you up.  Don't go to anybody else once reading this.  Tyke now has to be your pick.  So Tyke is really getting no work done right now.  Which is a usual occurrence for him.  He should really be working on his physics paper, or at least just finishing up the blog, but instead he is just chatting away online.  Yeah, time to finish this up.  Tyke has sorta worked on his physics paper all day, but not really.  He spent a lot of time downloading 80s songs as he is making another mix of a decade.  He's probably gonna redo the 90s cd just cuz it was a haphazard attempt last time.  Refuge was good tonight.  The student story was poignant and the rest of it was a lot of fun.  Tyke was in a really good mood.  Probably because the car ride over got him pumped cuz Dotti and Purdy and Tina were all peppy and fun.  On the car ride back Tyke stuck his whole head out the window and at first it was scary cuz it was like a roller coaster.  He just looked straight outside and it was scary.  Scary.  Then he got used to it and it wasn't scary.  Yeah, this blog is pointless.  But today was pretty good.  And tomorrow will hopefully be a fantastic weather day.  That always softens the blow of Monday blues.  Gotta love it.  Tyke that is.

      BREAK!  SPRING!  SPRING BREAK!!!  Already pretty good (initally typed god).  So today's actual day was pretty fun.  1st period Tyke got back a group test he got an A on and they still got screwed by the teacher because of her homosexuality.  2nd period involved Tyke dominating at football.  He may not be big but he can still play.  3rd period was a treat.  An easy, for the most part, test followed by dancing.  Yep, dancing.  Tyke got down to the funky 50s beat and shook it hardcore.  It was a blast.  But then Tyke had to say goodbye to Purdy for a little while as she was not in the second half of his classes.  It turned out they saw other twice more but still...Sunday will be fun at least.  4th period was its usual jocose self.  Hamlet movie barely got any watching by Tyke's corner.  They played Connect 4 (in which Tyke beat Amed) and then some games of Hangman (Amed couldn't guess SHOE when he had S_OE for the longest time).  So that was fun.  Then Tyke, Dr. Phil, and Amed went to Pie for lunch when Tyke saw Purdy again and then they were joined by Kinker and Macaroon for a wonderful lunch.  Then came 5th period.  A stupid calligraphy test in there but it was ok.  Then came the Physics mid-term which most likely sucked for Tyke but he can't really tell.  Which kinda sucks but it's ok.  After school Tyke played bball at Amed's with Dr. Phil, Maniak, Kcaj, and Macaroon.  Oh, and DUI.  They played some guys who had graduated 3 years ago, maybe 2.  No, 3.  Pretty sure 3.  One of them was big.  Prolly about 6'5" and used to play basketball, football, baseball for the high school.  Pretty good.  Tyke guarded him a lot cuz he is ok at guarding big guys.  It was fun.  Tyke ended up getting a major cramp in his left calf which he still can feel to this very minute.  Later on Tyke went over to Kinker's with Tyronious and Macaroon for Shithead, poker, Mariners, tacos, MOH, and ESPN.  It was pretty fun.  Certainly nice being on break.  That makes everything not bad.  Which is fun.  For those of you who don't like how Tyke blogs now as much as how he used to blog he will begin to divulge some of his emotions more frequently.  At the moment Tyke is just sorta relieved to be out of school for a while.  He is content (not really content but close to it) with his situations right now.  Unfortunately there isn't anything more he can really say.  At least for now.  This is just the beginning though.  More to come...

      A little bit earlier than normal for this one.  But seeing as today was a normal day that didn't have much of any excitement this blog doesn't need to wait.  Tyke took a group test in math and his team felt they did pretty danged well.  But ya never know with that whore as the teacher.  Grrr...Government today had some of the best clapping in a long time.  Kinker was honored with his Chili's Student Athlete of the Month award and boy did that ever give a good reason for applause.  His "stats" were pretty impressive so the applause was still deserving.  College baseball, that's not easy.  4th period was stupid.  That class is retarded.  But Tyke still does need to work pretty hard in there in order to bring his grade up.  His mom has now asked how he's doing in his classes at least twice in the last few weeks.  She even asked what he thinks he'll get for final grades (even though it's freaking quarter).  Tyke managed to change the topic by talking about the grad project so he is safe for now.  He doesn't exactly want to come home with under a 3.0 though.  So he should probably do a little work now.  Lunch at Subway was fantastic.  Absolutely fantastic.  Wow, just great.  Mmmm...mmmm.  Physics was pretty interesting today as well.  But it didn't taste good so Subway was obviously better.  After school Tyke has just cleaned up his house and semi-napped and watched an independent film on IFC.  Besides for that he has taken it easy (as if those activities weren't easy).  Oh yeah, Tyke had some good fajitas for dinner.  Nothing like good fajitas.  In less than an hour now Tyke is gonna go over to Purdy's and study for the Physics mid-term tomorrow with her and Haras and whoever else is coming.  So that should be at least fun if not learning-centric.  Or something like that.

      Ok, so for a day that had quite a few pretty fun events, today wasn't that much fun.  The actual school day was fine and it hardly took any time to get through it so that was a bonus.  After school Tyke took home Purdy and that was fun as usual.  Tyke would like to be able to take her home everyday because it is fun to drive with another person rather than on one's own.  Like Tyke does most everyday (other than at lunch).  It would be nice to carpool with someone.  Er, someone who Tyke hangs out with anyway that is.  Not just anyone.  The drive home was pretty quick though and then Tyke went on his way home.  Tyke got a call from Naan very soon after he came to his own house asking if he was going to the baseball game and whether he would like to be picked up by her and her ladies.  So he waited til about 3:40 and Skippy came over.  Then about 15 minutes later Naan and the gang came and they all went to the game at Sly Lion.  It was a pretty decent game.  But Tyke and Skippy ended up pretty much sitting by themselves so it wasn't like it was a total blast.  It was just fine.  Tyke was forced by his carpool situation, and Purdy and Tina's inability to drive him home, to leave the game early so he got home and waited for a little while.  Then he left for the school and the concert.  He got out and then Purdy drove up so he sat in her car and basically watched her eat for a while before they went inside.  It was not much fun so after much persistence, Skippy convinced Haras to come with him and Tyke and leave.  She obliged and the three headed out with Tyke's arms over both of them.  Then Tyke took his arm off of Skippy (*cuz he's a guy).  Then Tyke went home.  And he got a lot and a lot (*a lot) of change from his house.  Mounds and mounds of change.  As his away message says right now he got a 30 square inch container completely filled with change.  Around $75 in change.  That is going to be sick when he gets all that money in bill form.  Just sick.  He doesn't really want to Coinstar it and lose 8% of the money to that but he doesn't really have any other means to get all of that money into bill form so he can easily use it.  Any suggestions?  Yeah, today would have been a great day if Tyke had a girlfriend to drive around to all the places he went.  Or a girl that had interest in him that he could drive around to all the places he went.  Or just a girl that he could drive around to all the places he went.  Get the picture?  Yeah, you should.  Damn.

      Here is the first of 7 Wednesdays in the next 4 weeks (counting this week as a week by the way).  Yeah, when break is over and WASL schedules come 6 of the 10 days will have the Wednesday late start combined with the Wednesday class length.  All 10 days of school after break are late-start but 4 of the days are the long class periods so that is why there are 6 Wednesdays.  Anyway, today eased by and soon it will be break.  Tyke can't wait.  It's gonna be a good break.  Tyke has been wanting a break but really he is probably more excited about the fact that when he comes back from break school is going to go by pretty quickly.  Except, maybe he shouldn't be expecting it to go so quickly.  Cuz then maybe it won't.  It could even feel long.  And that would suck.  Mighty suck.  So for now Tyke will think happy thoughts about Spring Break.  And his trip to...damn, no trip over break.  Oh well.  There was nothing that was exciting about today.  Absolutely nothing.  Some good hugs.  Some good talks.  Some nice weather.  A little of everything.  And that was all.  So why blog about a day that was fair?  Good question.  Here's your answer:

      Hey, ya know what?  Today wasn't half bad.  Not even a quarter bad.  It was pretty danged decent.  It started off pretty well as Tyke made his math presentation fun.  Presentations this year have been quite easy.  Tyke just says some funny, random stuff and it makes the presentation seem good.  It may not be intelligent but it at least is entertaining.  2nd period was legs day which is a pretty good day for Tyke because he gets to show up his group in leg strength.  Nirvana is so good.  Tyke has been listening to Nirvana Unplugged.  That is probably his favorite Nirvana CD.  Nevermind is great too though.  And basically that's all about that.  3rd period was great.  Hardly any educational work at all.  Almost all group work/talk.  Then 4th period was its usual inane self but Tyke played a little game with the teacher without her knowing it.  He used both his fingers to flick her off and just kept doing it and would coyly retract them if she was looking at him but he just did this and did it in creative ways for a few minutes.  But then he got tired of doing it.  Man, that teacher is stupid.  So is that class.  Lunch at pie was as tasty as ever.  The rest of the day slipped by and was unnoticed for the most part.  After school Tyke came home and just watched TV.  He then fell asleep for short periods of time multiple times.  All before his court appointment at 5:45.  But he still got there early.  Traffic court was fun though.  Quite fun.  And not serious at all.  Tyke met up with Maniak and M&M and they went in and took their seats.  Basically, as Tyke has typed out this story so much tonight that he is tired of typing it so he will just start telling it in person from now on, Tyke made a mockery out of traffic court with his speech and got 15 hours of comm service which is pretty good.  He was filmed by Quesa for VTV and hopefully that will get put up there.  Cuz it should be pretty funny.  And Maniak's speech was quite funny as well.  He diagrammed his situation and also brought out the race card.  He talked about how he got the ticket cuz he had 3 asians in his car while the car in front of him got let out of it and there were 2 white guys in that car.  Hmmm...coincidence???  Almost definitely not.  So that was fun and next month Tyke and Maniak have decided they are going to go watch again.  It is quite entertaining.  After that Tyke has just collected some change and made about 20 bucks by doing that.  Then he folded some whites.  Laundry that is.  And that is pretty much all.  Shucks...Tyke could have gotten this blog out a few minutes earlier but that's ok.  Most likely no harm done.  Here it comes internet...READ ME!!!

      The finale to a great weekend ended pretty well.  Except for stupid Daylight Savings time which totally messed up sleeping time.  The other effects of it were nice but the sleeping part sucked.  Tyke got up at noon but he thought it was 11 at first.  Then he realized his folly and went "Arrrrrr...eeesshhhh."  But then he showered etc. and went upstairs.  His parents were leaving to go to a birthday party for most of the day so Tyke ended up having the house to himself basically until he left for Refuge at night.  He washed his car at like 5 and did his usual job of it when he washes his car by himself.  It's much easier to wash a car with more than one person.  So Tyke washed his car like his car-washing motto suggests: "Cleaner than it was."  It's not sparkly clean but it's nice.  And the inside windows got cleaned so that makes a pretty big difference to Tyke while driving.  After that he just fiddle-faddled around the house until Refuge.  Tina and Dotti picked up Tyke and they headed out.  Tina's car smelled bad because of the hoses that were left in there from the car wash and a puddle of dirty water was left in the trunk which left a pungent stench in the car and then during Refuge Tyke and Tina got a whiff of it again but they couldn't figure out why.  But Refuge was pretty good.  It was about doubters and skeptics and Tyke very much related to Kyle's views and such.  This was one time where Tyke did fully understand the message.  So that was neat for Tyke.  After Refuge Tyke came home and has been talking online to Kinker, Tyronius, Amed, Skippy, Commander Cool for a little, and Tank for a little.  Unfortunately, Tyke has traffic court tomorrow but hopefully it isn't too bad.  It probably won't be.  The Reason by Hoobastank is stuck in Tyke's head now.  But it's a good song.  There is also a girl stuck in Tyke's head now too.  At least one.  Maybe there is even two.  Or three...or...

      Unfortunately Tyke is really tired and sore and tired from being sore so he is going to have to make this blog a semi-short one.  Today Tyke got a haircut and shaved off a lot of hair and it was a perfect job too.  Absolutely no mess ups at all.  Perfect.  A little after that was the car wash and that was a lot of fun for Tyke.  Yeah, a lot of fun.  Tyke actually does wish they stayed until 4 but it was still fun while it lasted.  Then Tyke went home for a little while and bathed naked and then he put aloe all over his naked sunburnt back.  It didn't really hurt though and it still isn't too bad although right now it doesn't feel great.  He met Skippy down at Baskin Robbins and they waited about 25 seconds for Haras and she came down too.  They talked there for a while and then went up to Tibbetts.  They met Karla, Dudely Doo, and Big Poppa Booty there.  Then they went over to Jamba/Qdoba and got food there.  Then Tyke left there and went to Purdy's where he was joined by Purdy, Dotti, and Tina.  They all left and went to Jamba again for juice.  Then they went to the soccer game which was a lot of fun.  But they lost.  Then they went to Purdy's to get some supplies for the bonfire out by the lake.  Ekul and Tyke tried to get people to go skinny-dipping with them or at least tell them whether or not it was gay but they wouldn't really so it ended up fizzling.  Then he had to leave so Tyke was just funny around the fire.  He and Haras stand-cuddled for a little and then Kramm came so Kramm and Tyke cuddled.  Just kidding.  But later on they did.  But that was just a joke as well.  Haha.  Funny.  Tyke and Tina left for a little bit as well to go to Frederique's house for the cheesecake from Tolo as they wanted it.  So Tyke drove the two over there and they got it from the refridgerator and tried some of it in the garage.  It tasted funny but they still ended up eating it and bringing it back.  So they ate it there with the help of the people who were there.  Macaroon was one of them.  He played a good game today so he deserved some good cake.  But the cake wasn't that good.  So they threw it in the fire with everything else.  Oh yeah, Tyke and Tina also went to her house and got some forks which ended up being spoons and then they went into her room where the roses Tyke got for her in Freshman year for Valentine's Day (at least Tyke thinks so) were up on her wall.  That was kinda cool to see.  A little freaky cuz they were kinda dead roses hanging upside down on the wall but still really cool.  Later on Tyke was talking about them and Dudely said that they were a symbol of how Tyke was dead to her.  That was really funny Tyke thought.  But not funny cuz it's true.  Cuz it's not.  Basically today was good bonding time for Tyke and Tina.  Fun times.  After everyone left Tyke, Dudely, Big Poppa Booty, and BNelly all stayed at the fire area and talked.  For a really long time.  And saw a naked guy through his window.  And then Kramm came back too.  But they talked for a long time and about fun stuff.  It was great.  Then Tyke left and his car was wet.  He needs to wash it tomorrow.  Well, the past two days have been absolutely awesome and thanks for all those who have made that possible.  Man, this is what life should be like all the time.  Friends rule.  Thanks, yeah.

      This update is due to the shitty night that Tyke has had and the shitty mood that it has put him in.  What else could bother him on a marvelous spring break other than the opposite sex?  What else could be the cause of his constant longing for companionship?  Tyke is so very frustrated by his own mind.  The curses he puts himself through on a daily basis are seldom overlooked by the excitement of the occasional day or night of company with another.  In a year that has so many new experiences for Tyke, the only real experience he wants to see is one that he is forced to wait for until at the earliest, the summer is over.  Tyke spends a hefty portion of the hours yearning for the seconds that he gets to spend with his crush.  Desiring only to hold her in his arms or just to be in her immediate company, Tyke beats himself up over what he does and says and cannot stay focused on what he is doing.  Tonight Tyke tried watching a movie but he just got up in the middle of an action-packed scene and went into his bedroom to look at her.  Then he went back to the TV and sat down only to realize he knew not what he wanted to do.  He managed to regain himself somewhat and began to lift weights and do ab work but this became tedious and unfulfilling after only minutes of exercise.  So once again he returned to his recliner and leaned back stroking his hair the way he wishes the girl would do for him.  Be it the touch of another or the emotional attachment involved with another, Tyke is much too high-strung to be alone in his deserted house.  What is the answer?  So Tyke is invited to hang out or asked if he wants to do something by a friend but he will at times decline the offer simply to be alone.  He knows that he won't be content doing nothing with another guy around that does not understand what Tyke is going through at the moment.  The only person that has made it known to Tyke that he understands exactly what it is Tyke feels is seldom around to talk to and even if he were it does not mean it would solve anything.  Unfortunately, Tyke is afraid there is only one cure.  But this cure would have several steps, all of these ending in more heartbreak for Tyke come the end of summer.  This may be the worst time for Tyke to really want a relationship but although he realizes this he can't stop himself from feeling the way he does.  This has no purpose.  This blog has done nothing.  The entries in here are in no way a full representation of Tyke's thoughts.  For if they were his life would actually become worse.  Damn this.  Damn everything that makes Tyke feel so miserable at times.  Damn Tyke's manic nature that causes him to live such an emotional rollercoaster.  Most importantly, damn the fact that Tyke is so upset over something he can't change.  Nothing in Tyke's life seems to be able to change right now.  4 months will bring immense change however.  But all Tyke wants is for his current status to change.  Arrghh...Tyke is so frustrated.  So very frustrated.  His curiosity heightens when he is at these moods and that is a source of minor fright for Tyke.  For he does not like that he can become so focused on one flaw in his life that it causes him to begin to ponder what other things in life are like.  He knows that at this stage in his life he is in control but he also knows that down the line he could have a startling moment in his life that could alter his control.  Wow, this was a horrible decision to write in the blog.  Not only did it not make much sense to Tyke, it scared him.  It scared him of himself.  And Tyke is the one person that Tyke can't shake.

      Unfortunately, today wasn't a real eventful last weekday of break.  It wasn't bad but it really wasn't that good.  Tyke got up at 10 today and played ESPN until he got called by Amed to play some bball at Cougar Ridge at 1.  So he left for that and he, Amed, and Dr. Phil played like 5 games of 21.  Dr. Phil won the first game but Tyke won every other one.  One game he won by only giving up 2 total points the whole game while he scored 21.  It was cool.  The games got cut a little short due to poop.  Tyke picked up a frisbee that was just laying there and chucked it but noticed afterwards that there was dog crap all over his hands.  So he wiped some on the ball without telling either player and then as Doc P began to notice Tyke was already using Amed as a napkin for some of the rest of it.  When Tyke went to box out Amed on a rebound he wiped his hand down the sleeve of Amed and left a nice little mark of it.  It was hilarious.  Then they went to Doc P's and looked at the new Lexus and changed and washed up.  Then they found Here I Am to Worship on Doc's computer after about 5 minutes of looking for it while Amed called the cop from the "incident" on Saturday.  But his dad wouldn't let him go to court so Amed can't.  However, they decided they wanted to see a movie so Amed went home to change and met Tyke and Dr. Phil at Factoria where they saw Walking Tall.  It was hella short.  84 minutes is how long it is supposed to be but really it was like an hour and 15 minutes.  Hella short.  It wasn't bad but it was pretty predictable and not very developed.  But The Rock is sick so that made it good.  It is chuckle-funny.  On occasions you will chuckle but it isn't like a funny movie.  Just an action-flick.  For the price of a matinee it wasn't too bad.  Don't watch it at night for it would be a ripoff then.  Anyway, the three studs went to Macaroon's house and played Mario Party for over an hour before Maniak and DUI came over for a few games.  Then everyone split and the day was over.  Tyke picked up some BK on the way home and ate that but really he didn't do much.  He texted Purdy to see if she was busy but she was and everyone else Tyke could think of was busy too.  So he had the second night this week where he didn't do anything.  Not exactly a fun night.  Tyke doesn't quite have the sanity to be able to take many of these kind of nights.  In other words, when Tyke has a night where he wants to be doing something but he doesn't, he gets down and lonesome.  So he is going to go stop that by watching a movie and eating some ice cream.  By himself.  Bye.

      So today Tyke has not been able to view his blog so he can't be sure that the site is working properly and that you guys can all read this safely and surely.  Today was certainly not a normal day.  However, no day is really normal anymore.  Everyday has some new twist to it.  And isn't that just great?  Well, it would be better if everyday was wonderful but that would also depreciate the value of wonderful.  Unless you took the statement literally and that since it was already stated that everyday is wonderful, there would either be no varying degrees of wonderful or there would be varying degrees of wonderful but every degree is still wonderful in itself.  By the way, that makes perfect sense.  At 11, Purdy, Bigmaca, Macaroon, VD, Dotti, Amed, and Dr. Phil all came over to "discuss" the Hamlet stuff and work on that junk.  Well that just ended up being the Hamlet movie playing while nobody really payed much attention to it and then Amed, Dr. Phil, and Macaroon left cuz they really didn't care about it and weren't paying any attention and were talking.  After that VD left and shortly thereafter Bigmaca left.  So Tyke, Purdy, and Dotti got up and stopped watching the movie to get food from upstairs.  They made a wide variety of lunches that included much of Tyke's pantry.  They ate and chatted and then went downstairs again.  They picked out a movie from Tyke's collection and popped that in.  The Hours got the selection by Purdy and it was a pretty good movie actually.  Kind of weird and different but that is what made it good.  It was a little bit confusing at times but it was cleared up.  Tyke didn't really think the ending was anything too spectacular though.  Just eh.  Dotti left in the middle of the movie and then Purdy left after the whole thing finished.  So it was just Tyke alone at his house again.  He did nothing until about 4 when he watched this thing on TV about William Hung (American Idol reject) and saw his new music video.  He feels kinda sorry for the guy and also that his video is gay because of gay producers or whoever made it.  Then after that he went down to FedEx to get his brother's college packet from American University in D.C. where he is going for law school this fall.  He stopped by Fred Meyer and checked out some music/DVDs because he just didn't want to go home and he was looking hot and he felt numb emotionally for some reason.  It was kind of weird actually.  So he came home and waited around until Kinker got online and then they planned a very good poker game.  It was a great group of guys.  Tyke, Kinker, MSwa, Tyronious, Macaroon, Fejj, and DCups.  Tyke got 3rd and ended up only losing $5.  MSwa got second and took $20 from the pot and Kinker won with $50 from the pot.  The $5 buy-in game was very nice.  With lots of people it makes it more fun.  Then Tyke came home to find an IM on his computer from Purdy.  Even though it didn't say anything it's nice to see that somebody IM'd him.  It really doesn't matter who it is.  Just seeing that little message box fade from the black screen that the computer takes on while sleeping is very nice.  So that was cool.  Then he put on his reversible shorts and blogged.  And he feels somewhat at peace with his life.  Although really he wants to send that peace into turmoil that shortly would become heavenly serenity.  If you know what he means.

      Today was a really good day and it wasn't even because he hung out with friends.  Tyke just had a good time today.  He got up really early today (10) and went with his mom out to North Bend for shopping.  Tyke bought so much stuff today it is hilarious.  He is such a girl.  He didn't actually spend any money as his mom bought it all but still he got a lot of clothes.  He got 8 shirts, 3 pairs of shorts, 2 pairs of jeans, 2 pairs of shoes, a pair of dress pants, and swim trunks.  All today out at North Bend.  He now has at least 4 pairs of shoes that he will be wearing to school which is another reason that Tyke is such a girl.  But it's ok because he looks good.  And he got a pink shirt finally.  He has been wanting a bright pink short for the longest time and he finally found a cool one.  So he will wear that soon.  Man, it's so great buying a bunch of new clothes and also a bunch of the new clothes being for spring/summer and his trip to Europe.  Tyke got home about 2 after eating lunch with his mom and then he called Macaroon and Dr. Phil about doing the Hamlet questions.  And actually doing them too.  So they got together at Tyke's and of course started off by playing Shithead for 5 games.  Then they played a game of ESPN.  Then Amed got there so they played BS a few times.  Then they decided to actually work.  But they didn't want to so they played ESPN again.  And ordered pizza.  But then they sorta split it up.  Tyke and Macaroon did their part fully while Amed and Dr. Phil played ESPN.  Tyke and Macaroon finished quickly as Tyke went on a roll and just made some good stuff up while Macaroon sat there and said what he thought should go on there.  Tyke just decided to not listen to his ideas and used his own for the most part.  Then they switched roles with Dr. Phil and Amed.  It took them longer to do it but apparently they feel as though theirs is better.  Whatever, it doesn't matter.  And they aren't letting anybody copy the work they did today because they actually worked on it and planned this out so they are just going to bring it to the discussion group tomorrow at Tyke's house when Purdy and Dotti, etc. come back over to talk about it at 11.  It should be fun.  Tyke doesn't know what he's doing after that though, or at night.  Hopefully he gets to hang out with Purdy and/or/hopefully both her and Dotti (did that make sense?).  He cherishes that time.  After the gang finished Hamlet they played more ESPN and ate pizza and then everyone left.  Tyke modeled some of his clothes for his parents (sounds gayer than it was) and chatted with them for a little while before coming back downstairs to chill.  Tyke decided to take the night off and just hang out by himself which is something he is fine with doing.  So here he goes.  Damn it feels good to be a Tyke-ster.

      Today was pretty damn good.  Scratch that, it was damn good.  Tyke got up and went and got his passport stuff sent in at the Issaquah District Courthouse and then met up with Amed, Dr. Phil, and Macaroon at Tyke's house.  The guys said they were going to do Hamlet questions and that was their reason for getting together but that ended up just being a facade to hang out.  The gang played some cards and stuff but then they decided that they wanted to go play some bball.  They called up Tyronious and Maniak but it took them a while to come down.  So the boys played some raucous games and apparently everyone but Tyke was pretty tired.  Right about the time that Tyronious and Maniak came the gang was thinking about leaving.  But Tyke and Macaroon stayed around and played more bball.  It was fun.  DUI watched from the sideline and cheered on as well.  The new gang for the day, Tyke, Macaroon, Maniak, Tyronious, and DUI went back to Tyke's and talked and got some drinks and then they left for their dinner/mid-day snack at Subway. That footlong sub was just so delicious.  So delicious.  Tyke drove up to Macaroon's after this and Maniak and DUI joined a little thereafter.  They played some Mario Party before Fejj arrived and then Tyke went down to Sunset to pick up Purdy for Quartermania bowling.  They came back up to Macaroon's for a few minutes to play some more games and then they went on to Hillcrest Bowl with Tyke, Purdy, Fejj, and Macaroon seated from left to right/front to back.  Bowling was fun.  Tyke and Purdy made bets on each of the first two games.  The first game was the renting of a movie and buying ice cream for tonight.  Tyke really didn't struggle much at all for the entire game but then at the end he didn't finish strong and he lost.  So he had to pay up the first bet later on in the night.  The second game was for massages.  Tyke just sucked on the 8th frame where he somehow managed 2 gutter balls.  This from the man who bowled a 202 last time at Hillcrest.  So Tyke lost both bets which was a little disappointing but thats ok.  He also got called an "anorexic fucker" by some guy in one of the other lanes.  What's with Tyke and trouble this past week??  Twice now Tyke has gotten some namecalling and head cases against him.  Don't worry, Tyke is a "lover not a fighter."  And he's weak.  Mostly weak.  He just likes to try and look tough-like.  But he ain't.  So after the games Tyke went to JIB for Fejj's win from Macaroon's bet and then back to Macaroon's to drop him and Fejj off.  Then Tyke and Purdy went to Blockbuster to get a movie but it was closed so they went to Sunset to get Purdy's car and then to Purdy's house to pick out a movie.  Tyke picked Bruce Almighty since he somehow still hasn't seen it and it was good.  Tyke paid up with the back massages and ended up giving about an hour's worth.  But it was fun.  The movie and ice cream are still being saved up by Purdy though.  So Tyke still owes that.  Man, today was great.  Good times.  Good times.

      A long and eventful day without the sadness that accompanied yesterday.  Some might say this was a very good day.  It started (Maniak caught Tyke mid-type by IMing him and having the window pop up) off by going over to Macaroon's to begin the Hamlet questions that they need to have done by Wednesday.  They just about finished 1 question before heading up to Amed's to play bball with Tyronious, Maniak, and Piggy J.  It were fun times.  Then the gang went their separate ways for just a little.  Tyke and Macaroon went to Costco and were joined by Maniak and DUI.  This 4some would be the group for most of the day.  And what a group indeed.  Two hot studs leading the way with their two hot lady friends behind them.  You know which is which.  Macaroon was of course messing everything up and he just couldn't do anything right which posed problems for the dinner they were going to make later on in the night.  The gang went to Sunset to drop off Tyke's car and then Maniak drove the murder (group of crows, or in this case the "gang") down to Bell Square.  However, on the way there they stopped off at University Bookstore and got some, you guessed it, Cougar shirts.  Tyke and Maniak will match when they wear them on the first day back from break.  You just wait.  After that they went in to many a store while Tyke wore his cowboys shirt (with scotch tape magnificently holding together the torn pocket) and a cowboy-ish hat that Maniak had in his car from Tolo.  It wasn't really a cowboy hat but it looked enough like it.  Tyke saw this one guy wearing cowboy hat and tried to tip his hat to the guy like they had a special bond but everybody in his family but him looked at Tyke and they all gave him weird looks.  It was fun though.  Speaking of fun, Tyke decided after leaving A&F that he was going to flex for every girl that walked by him from then on.  He got some nice reactions for quite some time until one girl decided to talk back to him and said, "You wish, maybe if your 11-inch biceps grew a little."  Or something along those lines.  The you wish part she definitely said and Tyke thought he heard something about 11 and inch.  Tyke does not have 11-inch biceps though.  12 inch right bicep.  So prolly like 11 for the right.  Or 11 and 1/2.  Sumting like that.  The murder left Bell Square after Tyke tried on a $100 girl's jumpsuit at some store and then they went to DUI's for their stir-fry dinner.  The whole murder made it together although Macaroon seriously blew at doing anything.  So Tyke and Maniak hid a onion that they accidentally dropped down a hole into his rice along with a green bean.  That was fun.  And Macaroon had been making racist and sexist comments all day but he kept making more as he tried to eat with chopsticks and then made another comment to DUI that was totally uncalled for.  He needed to learn some manners.  Then he called up Amed and they told him they were coming over.  But Amed wouldn't let them use his hot tub like he should have so they kept arguing with him but he was being a hairy stubborn jackass and just wouldn't do it.  He brought out the whole "My parents won't let me use it cuz I'm too hairy" excuse but nobody was buying it.  It was just cuz nobody else was Russian.  That is the real reason.  After that whole fiasco they went up to Dr. Phil's house as he was coming back from Factoria.  So they chilled there and watched a show on MTV before going outside and leaving.  Maniak drove DUI and Tyke back to DUI's house where Tyke's car was and Tyke then said his goodbyes to the lovely couple before heading back to Dr. Phil's to join Doc P, Amed, and Macaroon on a walk around the loop.  Tyke joined up and then when Amed and Macaroon had to leave Tyke and Dr. Phil kept walking.  They walked past Tyke's car and then just kept walking and walking.  They talked about great stuff and it was a really good time.  Something that Tyke rarely gets to do.  Which made it great.  It was nice weather out too so it was pleasant.  All in all it was a great capper to the night.  As this blog should be.  At least for Maniak.  Tyke and Maniak hung out a lot today.  Good times.  Good times.

      This blog is a devil in disguise.  It is such a beneficial form of expression for Tyke which allows him to just converse with himself and others at the same time.  Just writing in the blog helps him so much that he will on occasion be so anxious to blog it clutters his mind with only what he is going to write.  Writing is an immense help to Tyke as you all should know.  The problem with the blog now though is its following.  If Tyke didn't have anybody read his blog he wouldn't ever write in it so it isn't like he is disappointed that a lot (or maybe not a lot but a good number) of people read his blog.  The problem is who may or may not read the blog.  The source of almost all of his angst and troubles stem from people who may or may not read the blog.  So this means that Tyke cannot write about what he truly feels and make it personal without completely destroying his relationships (or what relationship is left).  This means that his desire to blog about his depressive feelings is left unfulfilled and thus putting him into a state of emptiness and lonesomeness.  Tyke was really hoping that Dr. Phil would be online when he got home tonight but he is not, nor is anyone else so Tyke is left talking to himself on his monitor.  For a side note Tyke will divulge the details of his day to attempt to brighten his mood before delving into his soul.  Tyke got up and got all good-lookin in the morning and then his bro arrived.  Tyke chatted with him and did family stuff for much of the day but he also made a new cd that he likes as well as watched the M's finally get their 1st win.  Long overdue by the way.  The family talked about Europe plans and such and Tyke has now convinced his mom to include France in the plan.  It was originally just going to be England and Scotland for about 2 weeks but now France should be included which will make it more fun.  Tyke is most likely going to be leaving June 16th (day after everyone gets back from graduation/senior party) and will come back some time around the 4th of July.  So it will be a packed trip.  Anyway, Tyke's mom made dinner at about 3:30 and they ate it then.  At 7 Tyke went over to Dotti's and met up with Purdy to go find Dotti and her friend.  They found them and went to Refuge.  It was a pretty good message as usual but it didn't strike anything with Tyke just because he isn't a part of the drinking scene nor has he ever been.  Tyke also didn't become a Christian and then go back to his "old ways" or anything like that so it didn't really connect with Tyke but he still enjoyed it and found it uplifting to know that he is blessed with pretty strong morals (in a way at least) and strong support.  Afterwards they went back to Dotti's before heading up to Mandy's to watch some of the third Matrix and then TALK SEX WITH SUE JOHANSSON!!!!!!  Yeah, it was good.  But Amed's version is better.  Actually that's a lie.  Tyke drove Purdy back home as they listened to his new cd and then they departed ways and Tyke came home.  Tyke wasn't exactly a real funny guy tonight and just wasn't totally into everything even though he was excited to hang out with Purdy and Dotti and Mandy.  Tyke came home his usual longing self and just drove in a daze brought to him by a hole in his heart and some unwarranted self-pity that he tried to overcome.  Listening to REM's classic Everybody Hurts probably didn't make him feel any better but it made sure he realized he isn't alone with his feelings.  His problem is known far too well by others.  He just doesn't ever really get to talk about it with anyone else.  The problem with Tyke's situation is that he immerses himself in pain by his actions.  He knows one way that should be able to make him feel better as it has already worked before this year but this would require a lack of interface between the two people and that is not going to happen.  Tyke will not allow that to happen.  He just can't.  It is just so hard to have the unrequited love that Tyke has been forced to stomach his entire life.  The knowing that whatever he does he can't change anything.  No matter what Tyke does his girl is pretty much taken and out of his reach anyway.  Tyke hates the fact that he thinks he is so perfect for this girl though and how much they share in common.  You all should know who Tyke is talking about but Tyke will not say the name on here.  That would not be right.  Seriously though, how many times has Tyke fallen for a girl that is single and has shown interest in Tyke?  You can count that with a button.  0.  *buttons look like 0's is the reason for that analogy by the way.  It always seems that Tyke is falling for the wrong girl or has no real reason to have the feelings he does.  But love doesn't follow what is planned out.  Love sets its own course and it steers you where it wants to go.  So for the moment Tyke is left alone in his large metaphorical (and literal) bed thinking about how much he wishes he could know what it could be like.  Just to know.  That would be heaven.  Just to know.

      Tyke is finally blogging tonight.  It has been a long time coming.  A lot to tell really.  And Tyke would like to get it done quickly.  So here it goes.  Tyke got up about 12:30 and already there was a game of bball set up at 2 at Amed's house.  So Tyke, Amed, Maniak, Macaroon, Piggy J, Kcaj, and Jew played and when they got there some asian senior guys from Newport were playing on half the court.  So Tyke and the crew went and played on the other court.  A little after they started shooting around the asians asked Tyke's gang if they wanted to play and Tyke said no.  They asked again and Tyke kept saying no and that they did not want to play them so it didn't matter how much they asked.  Tyke was forceful in his answer (which may have made them mad).  As Tyke's game was going on in half the court the Newports decided they were going to play a full court game through the game that was already going on.  There were some confrontations that arose from this because of Tyke making a lay-up and landing on one guy incidentally so Tyke got pushed but he didn't back down because there was no reason to.  Nothing physical really broke out that time though.  Some other guys got pushed too but nothing escalated.  Tyke's crew kept playing their game and finally the Newports got tired of it and they just stopped playing full court so Tyke's gang won that battle.  Later on though one of the Newport fags came over and picked up Macaroon's ball off the ground and kicked it up and over the fence into the woods.  As was the dumbasses' luck, the ball rolled all the way back down to the fence that was outlining the court so they didn't have to go very far to get it.  Tyke started clapping for the guy who kicked it a la Sanders class and the rest of the gang chimed in and gave a rousing ovation for the class act that was this monstrously gay man.  He smiled of course and walked around like he was the shit.  A little bit later he decided he would go back for another of the basketballs.  This time it wouldn't work.  He went to kick it but Maniak wouldn't have any of that and went over to grab and protect the ball from it being kicked.  The shrimpy asian guy got pissed, jumped up and hit Maniak on the top of the head like a hammer and then he hit him at least once in the left eyebrow/temple area.  Maniak started to bleed but he didn't fight back which was smart.  Piggy J and Amed returned the punches with verbal assaults but nobody hit back.  Tyke was unfortunately going to get the ball so he was just outside of the court as it began to take place so he ran back down and backed up his buddies but at this point the asian guy was just yelling "You can't touch me, don't even touch me, you can't touch me.  I like men."  Well that last part Tyke added but he might have said that.  Maniak decided, with the approval of most of the other players, to call the police and report the incident for it was legally assault.  Tyke got out his phone and Amed called the Bellevue police up and said everything that needed to be said.  Tyke and the crew decided to let the Newports play their full court game now as it meant that they would stay around while the cops came.  The cops came and they took Maniak's statement and got him checked out by EMT's.  Then they talked to the assaulter and got his story.  The cops got the story from both sides and did their little thing.  It took quite a while for this whole thing to happen.  Tyke for some reason never got questioned which he was disappointed about cuz he wants to be involved cuz he was pretty pissed and wasn't going to take any more of the other guys' shit.  He just is like that.  He may not really be able to defend himself but he'll try for sure.  As two of the Newport guys were leaving they said something to Tyke and Amed and the guys sitting around and Amed said what back.  Then they started yelling and swearing again at the guys and then is when the public got involved.  Since this is a public park there had been kids and parents around the entire time who may have been a witness to the events.  One mother, upon the loud cussing from one of the asian guys, yelled back at the kid and called him immature, etc to which he had no real response.  He then left and that was that.  Tyke went over to the woman and apologized for the inconvenience but she said that it wasn't his fault the other guy was a jerk.  The gang then waited around for Maniak to give his written statement and the assaulter to be escorted to his riced out car and leave under his own power.  The cops told Maniak that nothing would be done now but the report will be filed and if the guy is arrested a prosecuter can take the case if he/she wants.  So basically he is getting screwed by his being a head case his whole life.  Maniak came back and the gang played some bump before heading off to Eastgate for slurpees.  Then Tyke left and came back home.  Tyronious, Macaroon, and Kinker came over at like 9.  Tyronious brought with him a picture of his Eastside FC team from some years back.  Kramm and BNelly were on it but so was the kid who assaulted Maniak.  Tyronious told him some facts about the kid that just further proved what kind of a guy he is.  So he is just retarded.  Basically though, today was an awesome day.  The whole cop thing was interesting and proved that white boys fight back.  And it also proved that cell phones are useful.  And not fighting back.  Oh yeah, the cop also told Maniak that the Newport guys stories didn't match up so the cops knew they were lying.  This was just a great day and tomorrow is Easter and is going to be a lot of fun.  Refuge should be awesome and so should the after time.  Good times.  Good times.

      Friday again.  That was a quick week.  Hardly anything that was super gay about this week.  Which was awesome.  Today pretty much breezed by.  First two periods had no SNAFUs and 3rd period was the dumb Sanders test.  Multiple choice and 3 essays in a 38 minute period.  That actually wasn't that long.  Tyke finished with about 15 minutes left.  He hardly knew anything but still he wrote a lot and finished the test quickly.  Then 4th period was gay again.  Dyke-bitch went psycho again and was just being gay.  Really quite annoying.  Quite indeed.  Lunch at Pie but the smell stuck to Tyke and it came with him for the rest of the day.  In physics they did a lab and it was kinda fun but still lab work.  And Tyke didn't think Purdy was being a bitch at all.  No problems there.  After school Tyke had Amed, Dr. Phil and K-caj all over for some bball.  Then Piggy J also managed to make a very nice appearance.  They played Shithead for a while before gathering up and heading to Sunny Hills Elementary for some bball on the court there.  The court really screwed the guys up.  Except for Amed and K-caj.  They pretty much dominated for the first like 3 or 4 games.  Tyke didn't play in 2 of them though.  But Tyke had no traction it seemed on the court and he didn't exactly want to get injured so he just took it easy.  But then Tyke played well again and he helped Piggy J to beat the dominating monsters.  But Amed and K-caj played recklessly and with heart which is something Tyke really wasn't putting into his game.  Just pretty moves and dribble-drives.  Which were still pretty fun.  It got so nice out that Tyke and Piggy J even took off their shirts.  Just a nice picture for the lady-readers of the blog.  That one's for Dotti who let Tyke wear the necklace she made for Piggy for some of the day.  It was itchy but nice too.  Well Tyke and Piggy came back to Tyke's house and they played more and more Shithead as Piggy was finally getting used to it.  But Tyke dominated for quite some time.  It took Piggy 10 games to finally get his first win.  But it was fun.  Then Tyke had pizza when Piggy J left for home.  Tyke talked with his dad for a while and watched some baseball and basketball before Dr. Phil, Amed, and Kinker all came over for some more fun.  This was some good times.  They played cards and watched some of the Lakers game but then they got a great idea.  They decided to play Risk.  Yes, the game of global domination.  And boy was it ever dominated.  Amed and Dr. Phil didn't exactly remember how to play/know how to play for the first turn so they royally screwed themselves up.  Tyke just flat out owned and he got his Australian continent bonus right from the second turn as that is what he always goes for.  It was perfect.  Then Amed tried to get a pact with Dr. Phil so Tyke decided that he would just do the same with Kinker if they got one going.  But instead Tyke just took over Africa and Europe and Kinker took over the rest of the world and helped Tyke knock Dr. Phil and Amed from the game.  So the two guys who most wanted to play Risk ended up getting taken hardcore by the two vets who wanted to play but were not so enthralled by the game that they were just dying to play.  It was a lot of fun but Tyke and Kinker won.  Then they played ESPN.  The first team was Tyke and Amed and Tyke carried the team of course because he has the game but Amed did a good job of not screwing up.  They beat the other team pretty well with the Suns.  Then Tyke and Kinker were teamed up and they played as the Clippers against the Lakers.  And yeah, they just owned that matchup.  Just owned.  Then came the best game.  The Charlotte Bobcats (expansion team for next year) against the 1980s Eastern Legends.  It was a very close game that came down to an OT win by Tyke and Kinker as the Bobcats.  Then they played some MOH and read some blog.  It was a really good night.  Hopefully tomorrow will be a good time.  Tyke might play some baseball/whiffle ball/something but he isn't sure.  And he should be playing basketball/hanging out with Kramm but he isn't for sure yet.  So that is all but Tyke is not done for tonight...you know what.

      Before anything is written Tyke would just like to say he is done capitalizing the H in He.  That sun sure was great today, wasn't it?  It was so pleasant to bask out in the sun and even be able to just go out and play in it after school.  Tyke finished off a little math test 1st period and the sub in there is a royal bitch.  She is so annoying it really pisses off Tyke.  She sat on the heater right next to Tyke's table which made him think that she was just waiting to catch them for cheating.  Sure they were cheating but she shouldn't have known that.  Anyway, Tyke, Amed, and Dr. Phil all tried to get the class out of 4th period early with the usual bag ruffling antics but stupid Dyke-Bitch went crazy and got way too caught up in the stupid movie they were watching.  So they only got out of class 3 minutes early.  It was gay.  And really annoying.  It actually made Tyke mad at her.  Very mad.  Lunch at Subway was ever so tasty and the rest of the day just breezed by.  After school Tyke rushed home to change out of his clothes.  He had worn the awesome pink shirt he bought if you didn't get to see him.  Let's just say that it seems the shirt is a hit.  That shirt is so hott.  If he had 10 cents for every time someone said they either liked the shirt or that they liked pink on Tyke he would have accrued more than a dollar in wealth.  He might have had like a buck fifty.  That is the new favorite shirt of Tyke's even more than his Habitat for Humanity shirt which he might wear tomorrow if it is nice like it is supposed to be.  Not as nice as today but still pretty nice.  So he might bust that baby out as he hasn't worn it for quite some time.  Back to after school...Tyke went to Tibbetts with Skippy, Big and Little Twigg, Naan, Amed, and Piggy J on the supposition that they were going to play kickball.  Well nobody had a real kickball so they decided to just take stuff out of Tyke's car and use that.  They took out a soccer ball, baseball bat and tennis ball, and a frisbee.  It was pretty fun for a while and Tyke and Piggy J were gonna toss the friz a little more at the end but Tyke decided he would go home and eat cuz he was hungry even though he got a Jamba on the way to the park.  But it was fun, so there.  Last night Tyke was talking with himself in his mind and he made some decisions about life.  He really would like to not have any of the romantic feelings he has right now.  If it is so easy to be hit with these feelings, it should be just as easy to get rid of them.  Especially if it is unrequited.  Tyke isn't saying he doesn't ever want to be romantically involved as you know, he just wants to be able to control his feelings better.  Cuz he certainly isn't making anything better.  So that is this little addition to Tyke's Troubled Thoughts.  Something that would make his life much easier to handle.  Not like it's hard by any means.  Just frustrating.  Tyke might go to the baseball game tomorrow.  Not for sure, but he might.

      Today was the first day back with the real Wednesday schedule since it was Wednesday.  That makes Tyke think of something.  Is there anybody that reads this that doesn't go to IHS?  Tyke imagines that everyone who reads this is either a friend of Tyke or is a friend of a friend and that most likely means someone who goes to IHS.  So, if you are someone who goes to a school other than IHS (BCC doesn't count) and you read this blog leave a comment saying that "Yes, someone that does not go to IHS reads this."  That would be much appreciated.  Oh, and don't cheat.  Anyway, today Tyke went to school and wore His super Karla-able (get it?) shoes which made it feel like he was walking on pillows or something.  They are so silent too.  He could do some real killing in those puppies.  Nothing was fun about Tyke's classes today though.  Nothing was much fun at all.  Sure Tyke laughed and had some fun but nothing about the classes was fun.  Tyke wants to be really happy again.  It's fun being really happy and having that feeling where even though it isn't perfect, life just makes you happy.  And Tyke also wants that so that He doesn't come off whiny and sad when He really isn't feeling that bad.  Just a little above fair.  Tomorrow should change that though because it is going to be sunny and warm.  Tyke has already decided what he is going to wear also.  It's gonna be fun.  Oh yeah, Tyke got His English test back today and guess what He got on it...40!!!  He guessed He would get a 39 and He got a 40.  That was cool.  Sure, it's a C- and it was the lowest grade of all the people who had their scores read off but hey, it is way better than what Tyke has in that class.  So that is cool.  And after school it rained really really hard for a while at Tyke's house but the amusing and very entertaining part of the rain was that it was sunny and warm out.  Tyke opened up the door downstairs and just listened and watched it pour.  It was extremely cool and relaxing.  It didn't have that smell of newly wet cement either which Tyke doesn't like.  Newly dry cement has a nice smell though.  Since Tyke can't recognize that smell He really loves it.  And it means that it's dry out which is almost always a bonus.  Tyke wants to go Go-Kart racing.  Yep, that just randomly popped into His head.  But it's true.  He went for Tolo and that was fun.  That's when He first did some rockclimbing as well.  But yeah, Tyke wants to hang out with some Sly Lion guys too cuz He hasn't in a while.  Like since the bonfire pretty much.  On Saturday though Tyke will probably be playing some bball with Kramm and whoever else of his is able to play.  That would be fun.  Nothing to write.  Nothing to do.  Tyke actually did homework today.  He is scaring Himself.  Tyke must be pretty bored.  Time for other stupid stuff though.

      Bah, today was not as nice as yesterday.  Weight training was pretty long but the last few weeks Tyke has been actually wanting to work out so he worked out today pretty well and he is noticing results too.  Exercise sure does release some nice endorphins or whatever the hell is chemically released through the body.  Tyke always feels nice after working out hard.  But then English was stupid.  Tyke went in there and took the little Hammy test and breezed through it although he is thinking he'll get a 39/60.  Or at least that is his guess.  After the test he wrote his little essay and it was all crap he just made up.  But he used his strong vocabulary to make it sound good.  Then he and Amed went out to lunch at JIB by themselves since stupid Dr. Phil has no 6th period so he just left and didn't even go with them to lunch.  That was gay.  But lunch was still fun nonetheless.  WASL days do need to have a longer lunch though.  35 minutes seems way shorter on WASL days than it does on regular days.  After lunch was Physics which is kinda gay sometimes now.  Like when Tyke found out he went Fishing.  That sorta sucked.  That made him go from playing Baseball to Curling.  Not exactly what he was looking for.  Now his GPA is like 2.45 or something.  But he isn't failing English anymore and that is definitely a positive.  He should be able to bring up at least 2 of his classes.  So today wasn't that fun but tomorrow should be fine.  He has a test in one class but other than that, posh.  Posh wasn't exactly the word Tyke was looking for but he used it nonetheless cuz Tyke is the Creator of this blog.  From now on Tyke will capitalize the 'H' in He when referring to Tyke.  Or at least until Tyke gets tired of doing so.  Tyke is excited for Thursday because then He gets to wear shorts most likely and that is always fun.  Shorts days at school are like the best days at school.  So it is time for Him to sign off.  And Raul Ibanez is a stud.  Tyke has always liked Raul believe it or not.  Even back in the early days of his Mariner/Rainiers career.  Same with Scott Podsednik.  And of course Charles Gipson.  But how could Tyke forget about Arquimedez Pozo?  Ok, now Tyke is gonna focus on looking at the All-Time Tacoma Rainiers roster cuz that is very entertaining for Tyke.

      Back to school.  Today was a breeze.  It was pleasant coming back today because of how much of a breeze it was.  Sure Tyke had to write 4 essays in 3rd period but it wasn't like he took them seriously.  The teacher basically said she wasn't going to read them so it's not like they matter.  1st period was fun even though the substitute was a total psycho bitch.  She kept coming around and telling everyone they should be working on math.  She repeatedly told Tyke's table to be working on math but they didn't care.  Tyke does not care about math one bit.  Just wants to keep a C in there cuz it isn't horrible.  He doesn't try at all though.  5th period was fun thats for sure.  Tyke came in and got what he had wished for, a substitute.  He stayed in a few minutes waiting to make his move to leave the class but he finally just decided to walk out right in front of the teacher.  He didn't even notice.  He texted Purdy to see if she was free to hang out for a little cuz he knew she wasn't going to much of 5th period either but she was busy.  And since Tyke's mom was working from home today he couldn't go home so he was a little bit bummed but not really.  He walked past Ritzer's class and waved to some people but then Piggy J came out and they walked around together.  As they were about to go back to Ritzer's Tyke decided to just go in there with Piggy since he had a sub as well.  So he went in and the sub didn't even notice that Tyke wasn't a student in the class so he just chatted it up with Skippy and Maniak and others.  It was fun.  They played some pokerroom and then began to play bball as well.  Those were some heated games.  After a while class was over and they all left.  Tyke went home and played a very aggressive game of ESPN between the 'Nics and Lakers.  'Nics won of course to move to 30-0.  Then Tyke had teriyaki for dinner and tried to print off some english hw he spent forever doing but the printer was extremely gay and Tyke had to work to troubleshoot the problem.  It took about 20 minutes to print off 2 things.  That was just gay.  Unfortunately Tyke hasn't had much that is super bloggy in his life since the Newport incident really.  That is perfect blog material.  Other than that though he has had stuff he wants to but shouldn't talk about or just stuff that isn't entertaining.  So that's gay.  Speaking of gay, Tyke and Kinker talked about how there are a lot of things in Tyke's life that sound like they could be gay (that may have come out wrong but it is true).  Tyke realized that his style is to write in a quasi-confusing manner that is full of inside jokes and stupid comments.  But that is Tyke anyway.  Funny but stupid.

      So break is finally over.  It didn't seem that short although Wednesday-Sunday went by pretty quickly.  Which is unfortunate, even though Tyke didn't do all that much on any of those days.  Today was Tyke's last chance to see anybody before he has to see them at school again so he went to Amed's and played basketball with Amed, Maniak, Tyronious, Macaroon, K-caj, and Dr. Phil.  Tyke played pretty well for most of the day.  His outside shot was pretty dead-on in the early games so he felt comfortable trying to take over the game.  They played some full court games and some old fat guy came and played with them as well so Amed had to guard that sweaty beast.  After the games Tyke went home and just sat around like he has done for each of the last 4 days really.  Watched some TV and almost did some homework.  Hopefully tomorrow Tyke does work on his dialectical journal.  But...you probably know how that will turn out.  Tyke talked with his parents some and even did some ironing with his mom which started off gay but Tyke made it known that he didn't want his shirt all stiff and that he didn't want pleats so he sorta did it his own way and made it work.  Ironing is weird.  Tyke used to know how to iron fine and he did it pretty frequently for some reason.  Then all of a sudden he stopped and now he didn't remember how to do it in the right order and just keep it wrinkle-free.  But he is starting to remember so he's pleased with that.  The iron is hot.  It burns.  Tyke watched a new episode of the Simpsons as since there is no Refuge tonight he was actually home while that was on.  It was weird not having Refuge.  It has become a routine for him.  And it is a great way to finish off the week by hanging out with 3 of his favorite ladies.  Oh well, next time will be even better.  So Tyke still isn't in a good mood but he got cheered up when he checked his email and saw an email from Tina.  She hadn't emailed him in over a week cuz she's been gone but she took the time to email him from Puerto Rico and that was a really nice way to make Tyke feel at least a little better about his current state of mind.  He still is a little down cuz school is starting up again and the other self-explanatory reasons.  The only reason Tyke ever really gets depressive is because of the same thing over and over.  And it is stupid but optimism is what it's all about.  Hopefully this blog was a little bit more upbeat but really Tyke is waiting for another reason to be really happy.  Just waiting.

      Man, Tyke has been waiting to update his blog for a while now.  The site has been down for quite a few minutes.  But now Tyke can blog about his 2 adventures of the day.  He went to lunch at 1 with Dr. Phil and Kinker at Subway and they ate some good eats.  Then they decided to go to QFC and cash Doc's scratch ticket and since Tyke had his monster coin bin he decided to cash that as well at the coinstar.  So make your guess in your head now before you read how much it is.  One last chance...$143.15.  Yep, incredible.  That is after the 8 and 9/10 percent that Coinstar takes out of every deposit.  So Tyke lost $13.98 to Coinstar but he did have 1491 pennies so he didn't even lose all his penny money.  He had 309 quarters and like 454 dimes.  It was insane.  Just insane.  He just about cleaned out the cash register he went to get the money from.  Or at least so said the man working there.  Then Tyke went home and did nothing for most of the day.  Just sat around, wanting to do something but not able to.  He tried to see if some ladies were free but nope.  So he kinda moped around longing for something to do.  Kinker and MSwa got a poker game going at his house so he was ready to play there again.  He went out for Chinese with his family and then came home just to leave for Kinker's house.  Tyke, Kinker, and MSwa were joined by DCups, Maniak, DUI, and Macaroon.  Tyke was down for a while at the beginning so he went all in but the river came a 5 and that ended up giving Tyke 3 pair because he had pockets.  So his pocket pair was the lowest and thus MSwa's kicker was higher giving him the win.  Then later on Tyke had KK and the flop came 3QJ.  Tyke bet big and bigger and then MSwa was all-in so it was just Tyke and DCups deciding who would keep betting.  Tyke bet big and DCups took forever but called.  There was another Q on the table and then a J came.  MSwa got excited and threw his JJ down on the table showing he had a full boat.  Tyke kept betting big and DCups kept calling after much thinking.  Finally DCups showed his AA and Tyke lost like 15 bucks on that hand.  It was monstrous.  3 hands with pockets.  The biggest winner had the worst pockets too.  Later on Tyke was in 3-way action with Macaroon and Kinker.  Kinker went all in 1.25 and Tyke called of course cuz he had about 35 bucks.  He lost and from that hand on he did not win until about 25 hands later.  He just kept getting chipped away and had good hands but got screwed by lucky draws or gay shit that just screwed him.  Macaroon ended up getting much of Tyke's money and it was not cool.  Then he left early too and cashed out Tyke's money.  So Tyke ended up going 1-1 with Kinker but they had been playing for about 5 hours so it wasn't that focused.  Tyke just went all-in cuz he got tired and lost so he ended up down 15 or 20.  Whatever, he still made money today.  But he came home and talked to Haras cuz she is home again!  And whoa, she just signed back online for some reason.  But yeah, today wasn't exactly the ending to break Tyke wanted (although break still technically has another day but it's a Sunday) but it was ok.  Tyke needs school to start to take his mind off things though.  But he doesn't want school to start at all either.  Such a complex situation.  Why can't this all be a little easier?

      What to say about the events that unfolded today.  Today was not at all a normal Saturday.  Tyke did three different things and they were very different.  Tyke had to get up very early for a Saturday for Tyke.  He woke up at about 8:30 and got ready in his suit which he really likes to wear but hardly ever actually gets to.  But he wore it and he looked studly (his relatives even said that he looked studly just in different words).  The graveside services were at Sunset Memorial Park in Bellevue.  That might not be the actual title of the place but oh well.  And Tyke just pulled out a long hair from his mouth.  Not sure how it got there but maybe it's Tina's from tonight.  Anyway, oh wait broom time.  Broom stands for bathroom for those who don't know.  Back again.  Back to the subject du jour, Tyke was at the funeral and the sun was blazing down even though it was only 10 AM and not super hot.  But with Tyke's black suit he really started to feel the heat as he was just standing around on uneven ground for quite some time.  Everyone gathered around the closed casket and some people sat in the chairs in front.  The chaplain (same as for Josh Williams) came over and talked and a few songs were played and then Tyke's dad spoke and then the chaplain told another story.  Then one last song was listened to before a basket of roses was brought out for family and friends to take and place on the casket.  There was a lot of crying this time but it was good to get closure for everyone.  Tyke found himself at the end almost coming to tears but for some reason he wouldn't.  He doesn't really know why but he just didn't.  Tyke helped his dad's cousin (what does that make him in relation to Tyke?) get over to Tyke's uncle's house in South Cove.  As Tyke was driving there he saw Purdy driving away but she didn't see him.  Tyke quickly changed out of his suit and then went inside to help with everything.  It was nice to chat with some people that he has never seen before.  Now that Tyke is a little older it is not hard to start up a little conversation with someone.  He always gets asked about graduation and college and those kinds of subjects as well as his trip to Europe coming up.  So there is plenty to talk about.  Tyke ate quite a bit of food and had a bunch of carrots while he was there.  As just about everyone had left Tyke and his brother said their final goodbyes and then they went back home.  Tyke changed and ate some more before Kinker came over.  They went up to Kramm's to play bball Issaquah v. Skyline.  Issaquah up 2-0 at this point.  Tyke, Kinker, and HoChyt were the starting lineup for Issy.  Ekul, Kramm, and C-Biscuit (sorta random name but Tyke does have a reason for making it up) were the Skyline players.  Once again the Issys came out on top but Kramm ended up twisting his ankle again and that thing swelled up big time.  He saw it at Purdy's at night and it was quite big.  None of the 6 players played very well at all.  Not sure why.  Tyke did play pretty well though.  Well enough to keep his team in the game.  The fadeaway is definitely Tyke's shot.  They hung out there for a while before coming back to Tyke's.  Tyke showered and changed and cologned and then headed off to Purdy's for Tina's surprise 18th birthday party.  The pair of Tyke and Ekul hung out for much of the night keeping their solidarity together.  Ever since TOLO they have had a special little thing going that they keep tradition.  And tonight was definitely a night where they could do that.  There were a few Issaquah guys and some Issaquah girls like Frederique there.  Kram was there of course.  Tyke played LIFE with the ladies and won with $1.7 million.  He was quite good at that even though he divorced his wife and never had kids because he got shot in the groin while on duty as a police officer.  Tough life but he made it out alright.  For some of the night it was kind of grouped up with the Issaquah guys (not including Tyke) together and the Skyline guys together with the girls all being together sorta too but Tyke tried to find a little way into one of the groups.  It's not like he was excluded or anything.  Tyke and Ekul hung out more later on and then they had a nice little game with the crane (that is the bug that Tyke was trying to think of last night) and other stuff as well.  Then they went to the bonfire area by Tina's house and had a bonfire.  Tyke and Ekul saw some muskrats swimming around in the water but they decided that it was actually Loch Ness monster because she has two heads so that definitely made it her.  Tyke only got burned a few times by the fire this night out.  Tyke talked with Tina some and Frederique some but mainly sat around in the blaze lighting his coat hanger on fire.  It really wasn't Tyke at his best tonight.  He didn't give it his all because he had that feeling come back to him once again.  Like it has so many nights he just kinda got pulled back into his shell that he is hardly ever in and he just sat around.  Tina pulled him over to her and they stood and chatted like they always do now but Tyke still felt the same.  Which is too bad.  He doesn't try to show it that much because it isn't like someone should have to try and make him feel better, especially Tina because it is her night anyway.   Tyke just needs to deal with it and move on.  He can't change anything nor can anyone else.  But that still doesn't mean Tyke can enjoy everything.  There were some really fun moments at the bonfire but Tyke just wanted something different.  He really wants to settle down it seems like.  Although Tyke hasn't had a real girlfriend before he still wants to just settle down now.  Tyke would not be opposed to only having one girlfriend in life as long as they married and stayed together.  Tyke doesn't need to go searching everywhere to find her.  He just wants it to be there and free.  There is one girl that Tyke wishes more than anyone in the world didn't have a boyfriend and you probably know that.  But it isn't like that will change, it is late in senior year anyway, and even if she didn't have a boyfriend it wouldn't change her feelings about Tyke.  It's always the negative that Tyke focuses on in these moods.  Also it is the hopeful possibilities that Tyke focuses on.  More those than simply the negative.  The worst part about this is the feeling sorry for himself.  Cuz that is just a downward spiral.  Having all of these great girl friends should be nice but it is a painful dagger at the same time.  It's hard to swallow the fact that Tyke is around such beautiful girls almost everyday but they have never seen him the same way he sees them.  The best friends of Tyke's are often girls but Tyke almost always wants it to be more than that.  Although he regrets it, he would most likely trade all of these girls for the one girl that actually geniunely feels for him like he does for her.  It isn't something Tyke wants to have happen but Tyke just wants to be happy and he isn't.  Girls make him happy.  Very happy.  And sad.  Very sad.  It's really not that complicated.  Tyke wants a girlfriend but doesn't have one.  Tyke has liked lots of girls.  Most of those girls have had boyfriends.  And some of them have had ones that Tyke really doesn't think that highly of.  It's a terrible thought when Tyke thinks that he is a better person than a boyfriend.  That often causes Tyke pain.  Cuz then it's like nothing is on Tyke's side.  Then Tyke thinks that he just isn't anyone's "type" but how can that be true?  Can everyone have a type?  Tyke probably has a type.  Well, he does.  The wrong girls must be Tyke's type.  Heh heh.  Blech.  Maybe Tyke needs to start looking for something different.  Like guys.  Haha, just kidding.  See how bad this has gotten?  Tyke has gotten to the point where he had to joke about being gay.  Not that there's anything wrong with that (name the show).  Nothing more seems to be coming to Tyke's mind now.  Such an early night.  Such a wishful night.  Such a lonely boy.

      Negative addition.  Whoa, today was Friday wasn't it?  Yeah, that meant that Tyke had school and that stuff.  It was quite an easy day although it started out stupid.  As Tyke is blogging right now he is looking up at the wall in front of him and he sees one of those big fly things with long legs but not a daddy long legs humping the wall like there is no tomorrow.  It is seriously vibrating like Tyke cannot describe.  Kinker definitely agrees.  The body of it just shakes incessantly but the legs aren't moving all that much.  It is like it is having a seizure that it cannot stop.  "What if it is?  What if in 2 minutes it just falls and dies?" says Kinker.  Well, then it would be dead and no more vibrations answers Tyke by typing.  Yep, still going.  Anyway, Tyke had to go to school early in the morning today to take an AP English test for extra credit which he desperately needs.  He just didn't focus at all on the test and made up answers so that he would still get the extra credit.  Then he, Amed, Fejj, and Macaroon went to Krispy Kreme's for donuts as a nice little break from the beginning of school.  Then into Farget for some money and blood pressure measurements.  That is always fun.  Tyke is a healthy sum'a'bitch.  Yep, still going.  School was stupid but it didn't suck.  Lunch was not wet today.  Nice and dry.  And hot.  It was greasy though.  Tyke is talking about Pie of course with Amed, Dr. Phil and Purdy.  Purdy is coming out to lunch with Tyke because her "only friend" is gone until next week.  Dotti of course.  After lunch Tyke was talking with Purdy about her 5th period and since she didn't have a car and elementary tutor he let her sit in his car for the period.  She said she would probably take it around the parking lot or something and Tyke didn't care.  So Tyke came out to his spot during 5th period to hang out with her for a little while but wait a second, his car wasn't there!  He called her a few times but she didn't have her cell so she didn't answer.  So Tyke walked around and went to Foods where he talked with Frederique for a few minutes and she offered him some of her smoothie which was pretty good.  Then Tyke checked for his car again and it still wasn't there.  But then he saw some other car coming in and it parked in Tyke's spot.  Luckily there were other spots still open in the senior lot so when Purdy finally came back from her escapade she parked it in a good place.  Tyke came to her after class as she was walking with Tig and she told him where she went.  She just got onto the freeway and got off at the exit by the Lake Sammamish soccer fields and Costco and all those places.  Then she turned left and took the long route back to school.  So she got a nice little ride out of Tyke's car although she wasn't able to use the AC so it was hot.  But it was a fun story for Tyke and a fun one to tell as well.  Still going, but barely.  After school Tyke came home and his mom picked him up to go to his dentist for a wisdom teeth consultation.  It was interesting.  On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the worst Tyke's surgery should be about a 4.  He's gonna get laughing gas and the sleeping pill but definitely no IV.  Hopefully there won't be any snags and Tyke will be in pretty good shape when he gets home from the dentist.  The appointment still isn't until the beginning of July though so after Europe he still has something to look forward to.  Tyke also got his suit out for tomorrow.  He finally gets to wear his suit to something other than his senior pictures.  It has been on Tyke's mind that he wants to wear the suit for a while now and now he gets a chance to.  Then he has basketball and then even more fun.  Another fun Saturday in the works.  But then Sunday there is some work Tyke should actually start doing.  Grrr...but until then.  Tyke Turner saying, still going.

      Don't expect much from Tyke in tonight's blog.  He doesn't even expect himself to be very understandable in this blog.  But here goes...Tyke got up early again this morning.  He met up with Dotti and they went into Sanders to watch Dave for extra credit.  Good movie but still too early for it.  In Senyohl today, Tyke found out that he is going on the Ashland trip so that is awesome.  He is definitely starting to look forward to that.  Although the rooming thing is still not worked out.  Lunch was, wet.  Tyke, Dr. Phil, Amed, Purdy, and Dotti all went to JIB together and as Tyke was just sitting at his place Purdy accidentally knocked over her water cup and splashed some ice cold water onto Tyke's lap.  It was a nice mini-rush for Tyke's groin area.  It dried out amazingly quickly for how much water actually was on Tyke.  It was a fun little experience though and it makes Tyke smile.  But for some reason basically from the end of 4th period on Tyke was in a bad mood.  What caused it he isn't exactly sure but he just didn't feel that good about anything.  After school he came home and went down to the funeral home for an open casket visitation with a bunch of his family.  If any of you have ever been to one of these you might share Tyke's feelings.  It was quite weird to see a dead body layed out in the casket for everyone to see.  The floral arrangement and everything was wonderful (a close family friend of Tyke's who does Bill Gates flowers did the whole thing) but it was still weird.  He looked lifelike, as if he could just be blinking or something, but his face was not normal.  It just didn't look right.  The idea though of a dead body being right there was still the weirdest thing.  These visitations are either really needed or not needed in Tyke's mind.  Some people just hate them but others really want that chance to say goodbye.  Afterwards Tyke's house was the house where everyone came to chat at.  There were so many people that Tyke did not know that he felt pretty out of place.  But he did feel as though he needed to be a good host so he made himself have fun by asking everyone what they needed and just waiting on them.  It was nice to hear from his parents after everyone left that some of the people had complimented him.  That is a really nice gesture and it is always heeded.  Tyke headed downstairs for some of the time and chatted with Amed about some grade things and about how Tyke apparently needs a C- in English now.  This whole letter he got is a wee bit confusing so he isn't positive what he needs to do but hopefully he can get it all taken care of.  He does, unfortunately, need to go in early tomorrow to fake take an AP test for extra credit in english.  It won't be the most pleasant thing to do but he can't miss out on points like this when his grade really depends on it.  This is gay that Tyke has to be put in the position he is in when he is an AP student that has had no problems up until this year and that is only because of Senioritis.  Oh well, Tyke will be fine.  Tomorrow will be another busy day for Tyke.  He has to get his wisdom teeth consultation to find out when he's getting them pulled.  So when he finds out he can let you know when you will get a chance to come hang out with a drugged up Tyke.  At least one person said she would.  *siiiiigh.  Tyke is extremely tired so he has started sighing.  His body for some reason just collapsed today.  His legs are dead, his mind is dead, but his biceps are flaring.  Eh, that's weird.  No more.  Sleep.

      Tyke happens to be watching the OC as he blogs but since he was busy during his normal blog time he has to do it now or not at all.  And when Tyke has a streak going like he has, there is no chance of him not blogging for a stupid reason like this.  Commercial break...1st period, Tyke didn't do his math homework for like the first time in a long time.  He usually just makes up answers so that's why he does it but still he didn't even do that this time.  But of course he was able to do it while class was going on so once again he sneaks by without being caught.  But man is she ever a bitch!  In 4th period Tyke actually talked with Senyohl one-on-one for perhaps the first time ever.  He has lately been wanting to go on the Ashland trip so he talked to her about that and she said she'd put him "on the top of the list" so he very well might get to go.  That would be fun.  Hanging out with Purdy, Dotti, and Amed for a fun week away from school.  Definitely a good time could be had.  After school Tyke and Purdy were both going to the baseball game and neither of them had anything to do so they went out to Subway together and grabbed a bite to eat.  They sat out on the curb in the sun and chatted about things that they had in common (which are plenty) as well as kids and such.  Then they went back to the school where Tyke dropped her off and went home for a little.  He changed and then went back out to Jamba where he met up with Skippy.  Let's just say that when you are a guy and you get a femme boost, you get some strange looks.  And telling the lady that your name is "Tyke" doesn't really make it any more normal.  But hey, that's the beauty of being Tyke.  You just don't care.  It's all about the comedy.  The two went to the baseball game at IHS after getting their juice and since Tyke had forgotten that the new exit getting on the freeway by Gilman only goes east he took Skippy on a nice detour all the way out to Highpoint before turning around to go to school.  It was cool though.  Tyke talked with a bunch of people at the baseball game.  Ekul, Skippy, Purdy, Tina, Haras, Dudely Doo, Tig, Karla, Triple Threat, Mandy, Amyazing, and others.  But that was a very fun social event and Tyke got Ekul to play basketball against Tyke, Kinker, and HoChyt on Saturday.  Saturday is going to be a busy day for sure.  For sure.  After the game Tyke went over to McDonald's and picked up dinner for him and his dad.  Then he came back home and put together this electronic dartboard that Tyke's dad got for his 10 years of service at Boeing.  Which is funny just cuz he has worked there for about 20 years total but in different stints.  Then he went down to Chevron to get gas and then to Baskin Robbins with Amed for free ice cream.  Gas is very expensive.  It cost Tyke about 5 dollars more than it usually cost him back when prices were pretty steady.  Then came BR.  The line outside there was insanely long.  So Amed and Tyke decided that they were not going to wait in that damn line for so long all to get the equivalent of a $1.63 scoop of ice cream.  Tyke's mom called him at that point telling him to get 10 newspapers that had the obituary of his grandpa in it so he went to QFC and cleared them out.  Then he went to Starbucks and cleared them out.  Then he still didn't have enough so he went to one of those stands outside Issaquah Cafe and they put in the money to open it up but there was only one actually in there so they just stole the display one as well.  It was fun to do.  Dr. Phil was working at BR but since he got really lucky and hardly had to do any work on their most busy of days he went outside and talked with Tyke and Amed for a little bit.  It was a very pleasant night out which made it more enjoyable.  Then Tyke came home and watched the OC.  The season finale should hopefully be very good next week.  That show has so many good looking people on it.  It's just insane.  Oh, and Tyke's going to be a stripper if his sports anchor job doesn't pan out.  Just so that you know.  A very hot stripper.  Private parties only.  *wink.  *other eye wink.  *shimmy dance (ya know the one where you put your arms just below your nipples and bend the elbow and then you bend your knees a little and shake your booty and arms).  If you don't know just ask Tyke and he'll do it.  Tyke and Purdy were doing it in Physics yesterday so that is what he means.  Physics, the class where only Purdy laughs at his jokes.

      Hi loyal blog readers.  Those of you who come here daily or near-daily are the true Tyke bloggers.  Today pretty much was gay though.  Tyke got up nice and late though and that made it a good start.  But then his mom made him do some work for her before he went to school. He had to find stuff around the house and show her how to use some things.  When they were trying to find the manual to Tyke's videocamera she thought they wouldn't be able to find it so she asked him if she had permission to go through Tyke's room to try and find it.  Tyke quickly responded "NO."  She laughed but Tyke was serious.  Can't let all those quarter grades and semester grades be found now.  That's all that Tyke can think of that he is hiding in there though.  But still, the possibility of her finding them is too great.  Tyke found the manual anyway though.  Weight training was pretty fun today.  Tyke got to work out hard and then play basketball.  The class decided they wanted to play bump so Tyke played along with them.  He had a 3peat.  Yep, 3 big wins in the game of bump.  He just couldn't be beat.  It was definitely his game.  English today was weird.  They were supposed to take this AP test but Tyke and Amed definitely weren't gonna have that happen.  They just put random guesses down and spelled out words by circling certain letters in a row.  It was fun.  Then Tyke called Purdy's phone and left a message RSVP'ing for this Saturday.  He whispered the message.  It was fun.  Tyke felt like a real badass.  They graded their own tests and Tyke just filled in some wrong answers in order to give himself a comparable score to the rest of the class.  After school wasn't much fun today.  He has had the house to himself the entire night as his parents are working on his grandpa's funeral services and such so they have been out.  This meant that Tyke had to take care of his own dinner.  Because Tyke took forever to do his CE stuff cuz he wasn't ever focusing on it he made himself a very poor dinner.  A bagel.  With cream cheese.  And a 7UP.  Oh yeah, later on he grabbed another bagel and ate that too.  This must be why Tyke is pretty dang skinny.  Although whenever he tries to gain weight he can't.  Tyke was disappointed to find out tonight that his bicep is just under 12 inches around.  Unfortunately for Tyke he was unable to meet that big foot mark.  Hey, he is a skinny guy though.  Tyke also killed a spider tonight with his grad project handbook.  That was exhilirating.  This spider was insanely fast.  Probably the fastest spider he has ever seen.  It basically went 600 feet in 2 seconds.  Basically.  Wow, what a creature.  But now it's dead.  So Tyke managed to "complete" his CE project and talked about a wide array of topics throughout the night.  The weather was insane.  That hail came down in buckets.  It was wicked cool.  But also very loud and annoying.  Tyke also managed to make a new mix today.  He is pleased with it at this stage in listening.   But Tyke just realized that this is probably the first time in his life that he hasn't done something for his dad's birthday or at least seen him on it.  Life sure has changed this year.  Much more going on.  And next year will be even different.  Wow, what a change it will be.  Only 3 more months.  33 more days.  That is remarkable.  A long time coming indeed.  Man, Tyke wishes he had something fun to say but he really doesn't.  He is totally out of ideas to talk about.  That's a bummer.

      Another day of life has come and gone.  Tyke woke up at about 3:48 this morning from a dream that he vaguely remembers being about the topic of life and death and the phrase "I Will Live" written vertically on a napkin.  Other than that Tyke is unsure of what actually happened but he did awake to find that his left arm was completely numb so he got up to try and recirculate the blood in his arm.  About a minute after Tyke got up he heard the phone ring in the other room (he has the phone in his room turned off now) and he thought that he knew what it would be about.  He imagined it was his grandma and everyone else staying at her house calling to say that Tyke's grandfather had died.  It turned out he was wrong but she had called to tell his parents that it seemed he was taking a turn for the worse.  Tyke was somewhat drawn to the fact that he had a dream about life and death and then woke up with his left arm numb (Tyke noticed the connection to a heart attack and subsequently death itself) and then happened to hear the phone ring in the middle of the night.  He certainly found this a striking coincidence if not something more.  But it certainly made Tyke think even more about worldly connections.  Nonetheless, Tyke quickly went back to sleep and woke up at 7 to go to school early in order to get some extra credit by watching Crimson Tide in Sanders.  It is a good movie and Tyke needs that free extra credit so he sacrificed over an hour of sleep for it.  The actual school day was quite annoying.  Math had the arrogant prick teacher back who makes the beginning of the day so unenjoyable.  Then came Government where they had to write 4 more essays.  This was just a total balloon burster as Tyke was thinking they would be doing something in their "study groups."  But no, she made them write stupid stupid essays.  Tyke talked about random stuff in them so it wasn't like he really did them anyway.  Then came a very nice lunch out in the blazing sun.  It was great.  But then there was still another hour and a half of school.  And then Tyke came home.  His mom came home and told him that his grandpa had finally passed away at about 10 in the morning.  So on Thursday he will be going to visitation services at the funeral home and then on Saturday morning and early afternoon will be graveside services and a family get-together afterwards.  Some closure is now being brought.  After he talked with his mom he went down to Farget to get his dad's birthday present and he just got him the Master and Commander dvd.  Then he came back and talked with Doc P and Amed about Senor(ita) Mysterioso(a).  His parents both went to his aunt's house to work on stuff for the funeral so Tyke did his homework and then went to Subway to get himself dinner.  He listened to some religious music he liked because there are a few songs that he really does enjoy.  Then he downloaded some more songs and has now just started watching The Sixth Sense as it is on TV.  It is a good movie for sure.  But Tyke also feels like listening to some Coldplay again so he will probably do that.  Basically some mellow music to go with Tyke's mellow mood.  Unfortunately Tyke is going to have to do his CE stuff tomorrow as he hasn't done any of it yet but that is ok.  He will at least get it done.  But you know what's coming up?  A lot of things.  And Tyke thinks he might go to the baseball game on Wednesday too since it should be good weather and he shouldn't have to do much if any homework.  Well Tyke really doesn't have anything to say today.  It's all pretty much been said before.  Goodnight.

      Tyke got up and had a plan already set out for his Sunday, unlike most of his weekends.  He ate some breakfast/lunch/brunch and then he and his mom went over to his grandpa's house by Bell Square where his dad already was.  If you didn't already know, Tyke's grandfather is very much ailing right now and is seeing his final days most likely.  He is not cognizant of anything going on around him it seems and he is just lying on a hospital bed in the care of his family who happens to have some nurses and nurses-in-study which helps the cause for keeping him in their watchful eye.  He is not in pain anymore but he still seems to struggle at times and he is about as close to a coma as Tyke has ever been a witness to.  It is truly a sobering sight.  This was not a sudden happening as he has been faltering for a while now but on Friday he really got worse.  Now he is just waiting out what seems to be his final days.  Tyke stayed there with his mom and dad and his brother came over along with other family that was there and they talked and reminisced about the past.  Because this was not totally unexpected they were not all silent and crying but rather having some pleasant conversation all the while watching Tyke's grandpa for perhaps the last time.  Tyke has never been witness to anything such as this.  He has not had many really close experiences with death and certainly never been with someone on their death bed.  So this is something that really made him think.  His grandmother made a good point by saying that it is hard to be born and hard to die.  It's not like Tyke hasn't thought about death before but it seemed so distant before.  He never knows how he will cope with death but he is doing fine now.  It is really just a sobering experience as he said before.  It makes you think about so much and what you really want in life.  On Tyke's first drive back from Bellevue he just listened to slow music and just thought to himself how blessed he is.  Then he got some food and went down to IHS to help Dotti out with Young Life stuff.  They talked some and then Tina came down too.  So Tyke hung out with Dotti and Tina a lot while working to set up the commons.  Tyke hasn't really gotten to talk to Tina for a while so it was really nice.  It seemed much different than how they used to talk.  It seemed so much more relaxed and friendly than it used to.  That really made Tyke happy.  It showed him that their friendship was just how he wanted it to be.  And of course Tyke and Dotti danced and chatted their usual random thoughts which Tyke is apparently quite good at :).  It was just so nice to be around the people he wants to spend much of his time with and to be able to have casual conversation as the sun shone down on them and not have to worry about anything.  Purdy came down about 15 minutes before Tyke left and they didn't really get to talk but he still got to listen to her and Tina talk about college.  Tyke left there at 6 something and went back to Bellevue where his family still was.  Tyke got to have some pleasant talks with his brother about graduating and college and their trip this summer and Tyke might even drive to D.C. with his brother the first week in August when he heads off to law school at American University.  So Tyke could end up having a lot to do this summer.  And now he still has a lot to look forward to.  Like Dotti and Tina's birthdays as well as Cinco de Mayo with Tina and Purdy.  As Tyke has been writing this he has been listening to Coldplay and making himself more and more relaxed.  Right now he is very peaceful and in a serene state of mind.  Nothing seems to be bothering him.  No feelings of being alone in the world.  No feelings of frustration towards his romantic life.  No feelings of anger at anything or anyone.  All he wants is to be in the company of his close friends and family and cherish everything they give him.  For Tyke would be nothing without them.  He lives his life for them and wants to succeed to make them proud.  And although he always has and will talk about how much he longs for that special girl, he knows it will come and he knows it will be perfect when the moment arrives.  Until then Tyke will just enjoy the company he is in to the fullest.  That is what life is supposed to be.

      This time of night to blog at is not as much fun as when it is like 8 PM.  But today was pretty cool.  Got up and the family was once again gone without notice so Tyke had the house to himself for a while.  He played some ESPN and called HoChyt about playing bball with him and Kramm but it turned out he wasn't able to play so they set another preliminary date for next week.  Tyke really wanted to play bball though so he called up Macaroon and Piggy J and Amed and others and they got a game going up at Amed's house.  It was great for Tyke cuz whatever team he was on won.  Thanks to Tyke's outright domination of the court.  He was unstoppable for much of the games.  It was really a lot of fun.  Even the outside shots fell pretty well.  And nobody could stop Tyke from driving the lane.  Man, this was one of the better days Tyke has had in a while.  He still wasn't able to actually dunk but he can get pretty high.  Like from a straight vertical leap he gets pretty close to the rim with the ball.  But that isn't important.  After the domination without Tyke's shirt on, the gang of Tyke, Piggy J, Amed, and Macaroon all went to McDonald's/7-11 for some food.  It was a nice little end to basketball.  Then they all went home and Tyke made himself smell a little bit better after all his sweatiness.  Then he ate some ice cream and some really really good freshly baked cookies before Macaroon called him up.  Macaroon, DCups, Piggy J, Amed, and Dr. Phil all came over.  They played some cards and then some poker with $5 buy-ins.  Tyke ended up losing 5 but he didn't play all that well.  He even had pocket rockets once but he really didn't play them well and lost on the river.  So he deserved to lose some money overall.  But it was still cool.  Tyke is starting to realize that he plays better when he plays against a bunch of people he respects.  Like playing with the people that are (sorry to say it but it's true) not as skilled or experienced makes Tyke play worse.  He gets greedy and makes bad calls and bets and ends up losing money.  But it's all for fun anyway so it isn't that big of a deal.  He did get beat today so it wasn't like the other people didn't play pretty well too.  Yeah, so Tyke hasn't really said much for today considering he did do quite a bunch of things.  He talked with Dotti a few times and he is going to help her out tomorrow so that should at least be some fun hanging out with her.  And he also has to visit his ailing grandfather who has come upon some rough times now.  Tyke really doesn't have anything to say about his feelings or anything right now.  He hasn't really thought about anything for a while now which is probably a good thing.  Hopefully it will stay like this for a while.  Time for bed.  Boring blog.

      What a relief for this week to be over.  It was soooo freaking long.  It really seems like Monday was sooooo long ago.  And today seemed like it was pretty long too.  But that was good.  Absolutely nothing fun happened at school today.  It was all just fine.  Nothing terrible, nothing spectacular.  Just plain old -_- .  That sorta worked for what Tyke was trying to do.  It will stay.  After school Tyke came home and talked with his mom about graduation and such and showed her the graduation announcements that he picked up today.  It's cool to have those cuz it means he's graduating.  And graduating is cool.  Other than that Tyke really didn't do anything until about 5:45 when he got dressed (wore the pink shirt) and went to Farget and Ted Meyer's for some looking at stuff.  He got his mom the Calendar Girls DVD cuz he knew she wanted that.  Not so much a movie Tyke has a vested interest in seeing though.  But whatev, it isn't for him anyway.  The weirdest part about Tyke's shopping was when he was at Ted Meyer's.  He went up to the checkout stand and put his little toy on the thingy and the girl (probably about the same age as Tyke) right off the bat looked at his eyes for a little and then said that she liked his shirt (well, it is pink...duh).  Tyke responded with a reserved chuckle and expressed his gratitude.  Then she did her whole scanning and stuff and Tyke paid and then when he was walking away he sorta turned back a little and she was checking out Tyke.  Now, Tyke may not get checked out ever but he can still tell when someone is checking someone else out.  But yeah, even though the girl wasn't even that cute it was still flattering for Tyke.  Tyke was definitely looking hawt in his pink shirt and sorta tight jeans.  Ouch!  Well Tyke went back home for a few minutes before heading off to Dotti's.  There he met up with Piggy J, MormoMan, Dotti, and Dotti's friend Carrotopolous (it is super hard to think of a good name for her but for now Carrotopolous will do).  Purdy, Tina, Mandy, and Tig came a little bit after them and then they all got in the 2 cars.  Tig drove Purdy, Tyke, Tina, and Mandy in order from left to right, front to back.  They all went to Beppo's for dinner and took many a picture.  The dinner was great and there were these weird chicks at the table across from them that were talking about a "sex toy party" and other crazy random shit that was interesting, but totally unsuspecting.  They seemed drunk but they weren't.  And none of them were hot either which is too bad cuz at one point they almost started making out.  But that was hardly the highlight of dinner.  Tyke sat next to Carrotopolous and Tina and thoroughly enjoyed himself.  After the nice, long dinner the gang went to this park in Seattle that has a wonderful view of Seattle and surroundings.  They took some pictures and made fools of themselves and then got back in the car again.  The drive home was filled with lots of screaming, singing, dancing, flashing, and craziness.  And of course, was a blast.  Upon re-entrance into Issaquah the cars split up and met back at the bonfire pit by Tina's house where they set up a bonfire.  Tyke helped Tina get the log for the fire and talked to her parents a little before leaving.  Then they got it all set up and set the place ablaze.  Karla, C-Biscuit, Dudely Doo, etc. all came down after the flame had risen.  Stories were shared, marshmallows were devoured, apple-cinnamon smoke filled the air.  It was a night to be cherished and a memory to last a lifetime.  Heh, that was fun to write.  But really it was great to spend some quality time for Dotti's birthday dinner and Tyke was exceptionally happy to be involved.  And Saturday's only just beginning.

      Friends is over.  No more Friends parties.  Only friend parties.  Haha, Tyke's phunny.  Well, Tyke has one big story to tell for today.  And another mini-one.  Today, the Sanders/Senyohl gang of Tyke, Dotti, Amed, MormoMan, and HeadRed (thanks Amed) decided they would skip English and go out to lunch for a really long time.  So they got a note saying they were working on the Senior Assembly and got that taken care of with the attendance office.  Then they all got in Tyke's car and they went to good old Red Robin.  They were pretty much the only patrons there and they went outside and got a nice table in the sun.  They talked about the whole spectrum of topics and the food was exquisite.  However, they kept on chatting and chatting and forgot that they had to leave.  So Tyke raced them to school but they still got back like 3-5 minutes late.  Which is ironic because they had all of 4th period and their normal lunch with which to use and they still went overboard.  It was something different and fun though.  After school Tyke came home and then changed for bball at Amed's house with him and Willy and DUI's bro.  It was a rousing, spirited hobnobbing affair.  And of course Tyke was topless.  After all of that glory Tyke came home and got cracking on his soliloquy.  He still doesn't actually have it all memorized and he kinda has to go tomorrow but he thinks he can do it under the pressure.  He needs to at least do well on it because of his whole, ya know, grade thing.  But after he did that work and took out the trash Tyke went to the Friends party.  He was initially told it was at Mandy's but apparently that got changed without Tyke getting notified.  So yeah, Tyke got up there and thought he was a little early so he drove around cuz it was nice out and he just filled up on gas so he drove over right past Kinker's house but he wasn't outside so Tyke then turned around and went back to Mandy's.  He still didn't see anyone there so he called Dotti and she told him it got moved to her house.  So Tyke drove all the way down there and met up with Dotti, Mandy, and Purdy.  Tina came over as well and now it is really good between Tyke and Tina.  It is really fun being around her again.  MormoMan and Fiddlesticks came over a little bit later as well.  Well, the final episode was exactly what it should have been.  It wasn't that emotional except for...hmmm maybe Tyke shouldn't say the part but it involves Ross and crying.  Yeah, that was sad.  Well, Tyke sorta needs to memorize lines.  And he is also a little bit tired.  But hey, it's Friday tomorrow and Tyke already has plans for the night which is always awesome.  Pre-planned plans rule!

      Hey, today was alright.  But tonight was fun.  First off, Tyke was told by Sanders today that she is retiring after this year.  Tyke has to believe that a part of her reasoning has been because of his class.  They have been somewhat brutal to her.  But it's all fun so that's all that matters.  But this means that there is definitely going to be at least one Retirement Party for her.  In 4th period today Tyke had to only have one lunch but it was still cool.  They didn't talk about anything productive in there other than Ashland stuff.  Here is a little advertisement that Tyke should really start having more of in his blog.  It has come to Tyke's attention that Piggy J is unaware of who he is going to take to prom.  Now ladies, if you don't know who Tyke is talking about then you are definitely out of the loop.  This is the man who can do a spot-on imitation of Mr. Dineen.  And folks, Mr. Dineen is one sexy son of a bitch.  Piggy J has great taste in music and is also the owner of a hott automobile that will in the near future be replaced by a car of his choosing.  So if that isn't enough to get your blood boiling (in a good way) then you are a little bit lesbian.  Just a little bit though.  But if you do think that Piggy J is one of the hot bachelors out there (not quite in Tyke's league but who is??) then just let Tyke know.  Tyke can try to hint to Piggy J that he should ask you to prom.  And if it isn't enough to go with Piggy J, you just might get to go in the same prom group as Tyke as well.  So there is another incentive.  Tyke's single too by the way.  *wink.  He's aware of his situation though.  Well, to continue with Tyke's day let's go to after school.  Tyke came home and ate some good food before leaving for his haircut.  He then went to Tina's house to pick her up for their dinner date.  It wasn't a date but how can you blame Tyke for wanting to say that?  Don't worry though, Tyke is past it.  A late addition to Tyke and Tina's dinner was Dotti.  So they went over to her house and picked her up.  She had FINALLY come back from Nashville and she told them about some stories there.  Then they got to La Costa where it was apparently silent taco night for the sign language students but they didn't eat together.  This was a really great dinner.  It was totally fun to sit and talk with two of Tyke's best lady friends.  They talked about lots of things.  Like prom, Tyke and Kram, Mexico, and just fun stuff.  Since Tyke doesn't get to spend much time with Tina it was awesome and then since Dotti has been gone for a week they haven't gotten to talk either so it was a stupendous dinner.  After they finally decided to leave and Tina gave Tyke his present (a beautiful framed picture of Tyke and Tina on Homecoming night) they went to Tyke's car so he could give Tina her present and card and Dotti her card.  Oh, but since Tyke just went to look at the picture of him and Tina he has to mention something.  Maybe Tyke is way wrong but he has seen two pictures of him in the last few weeks that make it look like he has a lazy eye or something.  First was his passport picture.  And now the picture at homecoming.  It's weird but Tyke doesn't look like he sees himself.  Sure he sees himself backwards from everybody else but he doesn't think he would get a messed up eye level thing going on.  But it is still a lovely picture and he doesn't care that much about his appearance so it's fine with him.  That's why Tyke shaved his head again (well, cut really short).  Now Tyke doesn't have to do anything to his hair before he goes out since it's so short.  Ok, back to Tyke's presents.  He got Tina one of those Neopets he got Purdy for her birthday.  But this one has a dirty voice.  It is just so naughty.  It is quite hilarious though.  And Tina seemed to like it which is all that matters.  The card he got her was this really weird card that is apparently for someone who is leaving a person under bad circumstances so the card is kind of angry.  But who ever gets a card for that situation???  It was so random that Tyke had to get it for her.  And the card for Dotti was a card that had this little reflective strip on it that is supposed to show the person who is reading the card but it shows a distorted version of the person so it sucks.  But it's funny.  Like Tyke (rhyme).  Well Tyke drove the two ladies home and said their goodbyes and Tyke came home to blog.  But this was a great night.  It was so fulfilling.  Nothing negative about it.  Other than it ending.  Now the OC finale is on though.  Which is way more important than West Wing.  West Wing...more like...wow, hard to change that into something funny.  Ok, OC.

      Hmmm...to blog well or not to blog well?  Well, here's the answer.  Not well.  There is one story Tyke could tell but he has decided he isn't going to just cuz it would take a long time and Tyke has been doing a pretty good job of blogging lately, in his mind, so he will take a night off.  Tyke and his 1st period group drew Guernica 4.0 which if you know what he is referring to, then you will laugh but otherwise you will not think it's very funny.  In 4th period today Tyke got there and a girl was "having some problems" so the class was told to take 1st lunch.  So they did and then Tyke's crew, Amed, Dr. Phil, Purdy, Tank, etc. all went to Quizno's for lunch.  Tyke still isn't a big fan of Quizno's.  Subway is by far the best.  Then they came back and ended up getting let out of class like 15 minutes early so they just went out to Tyke's car and played a fun game with a little feather.  After school Tyke went to Mr. Lynn (teacher at IHS) and got his speeding ticket community service hours signed off.  He asked Tyke a few questions that Tyke didn't have the answers to but Tyke just made up answers and he signed them off.  Then he went out to his car and was about to leave when Piggy J came up and they talked for a little and then Tyke invited him to go shopping with him for a little while.  So they went to Mills Music for Piggy and then they went to Blockbuster where Tyke got Hamlet for his mom.  Then they went to Ted Meyer's and Tyke got a really random card and a present for Tina that he wanted to get before.  Then they went back to the school and Tyke went home where he ate a lot of Pringles.  Then he fell asleep while watching the Heat beat the Hornets.  Then he did some soliloquizing for Senyohl.  Speaking of Senyohl, here is something that Amed wrote for...well, he just wrote it for fun apparently.  To ruffle or not to ruffle: that is the question Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of a senile bitch, Or to take chairs against a sea of senility, And by opposing end it?  To wait, to mourn; No more: and by waiting to say we suffer The heart-ache and the thousand naturals shocks that hearing her talk about her horses is Heir to.  'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd.  To wait, to mourn, to mourn perchance to daydream: aye, there's the rub; For in that daydream of longing for lunch what splendid wetdreams may come When we have shuffled the old bitch off our backs Must give us pause, there's the lack of respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of that class, The bitch is always wrong, but the proud man's contumely The pangs of despising that bitch, the law's dela,y The insolence of her attempting to teach and the spurns That  patient merit of the unworthy takes, When  she herself might her quietus make With a bare bodkin exposing her stupidity? Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat  Under the fuzzy lights of her retarded class No student returns unaware of her idiocy, it puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills that we have ourselves Than fly into that dumbass class again? Thus our conscience tells us to go kill her and not be cowards, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sickle'd over with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great ruffling and moment With this regard the ruffle turns awry, And loses its effect because people on the other side of the room fuck up - Soft you Now!  The unfair Senyohl! Dyke, in thy orisons Be all your sins remembered, biatch!  Tyke didn't edit it at all so it is all Amed there.  Well, Tyke is hungry.  Actually no he's not.  But he's gonna eat anyway.  And just finish off his Tuesday night for on Wednesday he has two activities he is looking forward to.  Sleep.

      School.  Tis the most troublesome part of any week.  To cease schooling, to live life to its fullest.  Ay there's the rub.  Well that was fun.  Right before Tyke started blogging for tonight he decided to start working on his solilioquy for the first time.  He has spent less than 5 minutes so far on it and this is what he knows: To be or not to be, that is the question.  Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and, by opposing them, end them.  To die, to sleep-no more.  Eh, thats pretty much it but considering he has hardly spent any time doing this and the only time he spent on it was while he was brooming so he wasn't really working very hard.  He can memorize that pretty easily he thinks.  Whoo...Tyke just left the computer for like 15 minutes just now.  He got some cake, talked to his parents, noticed a buzzing noise emanating from the upstairs TV, the lights just flickered, got his mom's Blockbuster card, and grabbed the papers he needs to hopefully get his community service signed off for his speeding ticket.  Now he is finally ready to do some serious blogging.  Although there isn't much to say.  Tyke had a pretty good 1st period today which was followed by a hard workout in weight training.  However, Tyke's left achilles tendon has been bothering him since he played basketball after school and that might be partly because of doing legs workout earlier on.  4th period was a snap today.  Tyke and Purdy talked about the interesting parts of their Sunday and the gang hardly even needed to do any bag ruffling like they always do.  It was an easy day.  The pizza at Pie today was spectacular.  A great slice of cheese today perfectly complimented by Tyke's addition of the ground peppers which is a tradition of his much like Dr. Phil's dousing of parmesan cheese.  The rest of the day eased on and Tyke came home to find out that a basketball game was being set up.  Tyke, Amed, Piggy J, and Maniak went out to Amed's court (still no sighting of Kheng and the Newport "gangstas") to play hoops.  It was a fun few games and then they played against some kids that were younger than them but obviously played basketball unlike Tyke's crew.  One kid was quite good.  Much better than Tyke even.  And another kid was better too in fact but he was big too.  He had a huge head.  It was like the size of Tyke's monitor for his computer.  MONSTROUS!  But Amed had to guard him so ha!  Well, 10.5 is starting now so Tyke is going to go back and watch what he started to watch last night.  It's fun to see these "disaster mini-series."  Nothing like a good fake catastrophe that takes out the entire west coast.  Let's go nuke some bitches!

      Happy birthday to Piggy J and Tina.  A big day for them.  And hopefully a fun day for both as well.  They deserve it.  That is a nice start off to today's blog.  And today wasn't as bad as it could have been.  Tyke got up at 10 but since he went to bed fairly early last night (fell asleep before midnight) he wasn't all that tired.  He still didn't get out of bed until 11 though.  But eh, NBA playoff basketball is more fun thatn moving around anyway.  As well as the Mariners, who actually hit pretty well today for like the 3rd time all year.  When he finally did get up he actually ate a breakfast.  Only a blueberry muffin but those are very delectible when they are consumed correctly.  Then he watched some more of the playoffs and Mariners game before playing his own ESPN game.  Then he went upstairs and talked with his mom about some stuff and then they went downstairs and fixed the cabinet under the sink in Tyke's bathroom.  It was a funny way to break that door in the first place though.  Tyke was wearing his blue cargo shorts and he turned to leave the room and kinda had a fast walk or a little jog about to start but part of his cargo pocket caught the door handle and ripped off the door hinge.  It was really weird.  Tyke tried to put it back together but he couldn't so he called his mom for assistance and together they put it back together.  Tyke isn't that handy at this stage in his life but he wants to be.  He also wants to learn how to cook.  Basically he wants to learn how to do things that would make him a better husband.  Truthfully, that is the primary reason for him wanting to improve such qualities.  Not a bad reason though.  Tyke thus started on his homework for English, which is pretty much the only class he really needs to do homework in.  Oh wait, maybe Math too.  Drat!  Hahaha, his mom uses that word a lot.  It must rub off on Tyke.  She occasionally says shit and bitch and damn but never fuck.  Tyke wonders if his parents know he swears.  His brother should but maybe not his parents.  He is pretty different around his parents.  Much more reserved for sure.  And hardly ever talks with them about his problems.  Could be a bad thing but it doesn't really trouble Tyke.  He could talk with them if he wanted to but he just doesn't want to most times.  Let's see...what else did Tyke do today?  He worked on the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern questions for much of the day.  He did the first 20 all on his own before Dr. Phil got online and Tyke asked him if he wanted to split up the work.  They got Amed involved as well but when Amed and Dr. Phil got together to work on the questions they didn't have the actaul questions.  Tyke tried to get them the questions but couldn't so they ended up calling Macaroon and he had already done them all so he just sent them to everyone to paraphrase.  Tyke kept his first 20 but then just used Macaroon's for the second half.  Then they went to play basketball at Cougar Ridge.  Tyke came near the end of their first 21 game when Amed had 19 points so Tyke wasn't able to win that game.  But then the next game he did win.  And then they played like 5 two on two games.  Tyke's team won every time.  When Tyke and Dr. Phil were teammates, Tyke scored all of the team's points.  Tyke has gotten so much better this year at basketball.  He dominates whenever he plays with the Issaquah guys (not counting Kinker but he hasn't played with them in a while).  Now Tyke has gotten confidence too which means he always wants the ball in his hands.  And his jumpshot has improved a lot too.  Oh yeah, you guys probably don't care about all this.  Oh well, Tyke does.  After bball Tyke came home and got some dinner at Burger King.  Then he came home and finally exchanged gifts with his dad for his birthday, which was last Tuesday.  But it has been a hectic week for Tyke's parents.  They are still very tired.  And another thing that happened this week is that Tyke's grandma (Dad's side) lost her sister at the end of the week.  First her husband, now her sister.  Definitely a tough week for her.  That has to be simply terrible.  Tyke hopes he can be so lucky as to not have to go through the pain of losing a very close loved one and then once he starts to heal, find out that another of his close relatives has died.  It is a part of life though and death has to be dealt with.  But it makes it easier when you can at least separate the deaths from other tragedies.  Anyway, now that Tyke has paraphrased the rest of his work he is going to go try and print off the questions.  Actually, no he is not.  His dad just came downstairs and said that he is still having problems so he is going to try and do it but if he can't, well he can't.  Unfortunately Tyke has to go back to regular school schedules again as well as the return of the rain.  The only thing he has to look forward to this week is getting to drive the Avalon on Tuesday, going to dinner with Purdy and Tina on Wednesday, and the week being over on Friday.  Wow, after Monday Tyke's countdown will be at 29.  In the 20s.  This is getting exciting.  And sad.  Tyke doesn't want to leave some of his friends behind at all.  The beginning of college will be fine in that Purdy and Tina are going to come down and visit Tyke and Ekul at WSU but once they leave again it will be long spurts between visits.  Sad.  But Haras should be back at school tomorrow if Tyke remembers right.  They haven't talked for a while really.  And Dotti gets back later this week as well.  And hopefully Ashland is worth it for Tyke.  Love.

      Tyke has taken more naps this week than any other week in his life.  Well, any other week in the last 10 years of his life.  And that might even be true.  It very well might not be exaggeration.  Tyke just yawned now even.  Today though was a great day.  Tyke got screwed in math and got one of the two worst new seats in the class and just had to sit there for a long time.  But then 2nd period was fun.  Tyke had some people talk to him as he was walking to class which is always fun cuz it is unexpected cuz it's from people he doesn't normally talk to.  Like this one junior girl who really liked his pink shirt yesterday has been talking to him a lot the past week and seems to think he's pretty cool which makes Tyke feel good, even though she has a boyfriend so it's not like she likes him.  Well, seh could but odds are not.  But now she talks with Tyke about a lot of things and whenever she sees Tyke somewhere she goes out of her way to say hi or say something to him and that is nice.  Like after school she yelled at Tyke to have a great weekend from approximately 58 feet away while walking with her boyfriend.  Oh, here's something that Tyke doesn't super like about his blog.  Whenever he mentions something like this that has to do with a girl he always seems to get at least one person who thinks that now Tyke has a thing for the girl.  Well, that usually isn't true.  That impression just comes because Tyke takes a little bit of time to mention some fun stuff that happened and since often she is the only girl Tyke talks about that day, it seems like he is developing a crush on her.  Let's just squash that idea that Tyke has a crush on this girl.  There.  That's done.  But anyway, Tyke played Bump in Weight Training again today and he is really good of course.  The junior girl always talks about how she has to beat Tyke at Bump in order to make her junior year a success so today she finally did beat him.  And it wasn't like Tyke let her.  She just beat him.  Then in 3rd period they were forced to watch Not Without My Daughter which is a pretty sad movie but Tyke doesn't want to be watching that 2 days after the AP test when he could be watching Rounders or something like that or even just sitting and talking.  But after that class Tyke went to 4th period where he acted out Waiting for Godot and did his Lucky soliloquy.  That shit was weird.  No punctuation at all.  Odd.  Then they went to Pie for lunch.  And in 5th period Tyke had a sub.  So he took attendance and then left.  He went to Kinker's class for a while and they played some Trivial Pursuit trivia with each other and then watched some SNL skits.  Then Tyke took Kinker's bag to his car and put it there so Kinker didn't have to carry it.  Tyke talked with a few people before seeing Purdy walking back to school so he went over to here and they walked around together.  Then they saw Haras and talked for a bit before walking to the senior courtyard and sitting together in the sun.  Karla came out and made some friendly chit-chat (sounds funny) but then class was over.  So they went to 6th period.  Tyke pretended that he was HoChyt for attendance and said he was here and then he was himself also, if that makes sense.  Then he called HoChyt and told him he didn't need to come to class cuz they had a sub.  Later on in the most boring of movies, HoChyt came in and said that he was from ASB and needed to get out Tyke Turner, Purdy McHot, and Kinker for some reason that Tyke doesn't remember now.  So the sub let him and then they just left.  Then Tyke and Purdy walked around more and dropped her bag off in Tyke's car for after school.  Then they went back into the sun and sat in it for the rest of the school day before finally leaving.  And then Tyke went home to change and go down to South Cove for some bball with Amed, Maniak, Jew, Dr. Phil, and Macaroon.  It was cool and Tyke seems to be starting to get a little bit of a tan from playing so many basketball games without a shirt on.  That is a good thing cuz Tyke is pretty white.  Then Tyke came home and basically was asleep until 8 with dinner in the mix there and watching some NBA games on TV as well.  Then he was so tired he didn't want to do anything at night but tomorrow he is gonna go tux shopping/searching with Amed among other things.  So time for ice cream, milk, and ESPN now.  Bye all.  Hope all those in Lake Wenatchee are having fun, like Purdy.

      Beautiful weather out.  That made it just dandy for Tyke to go outside and take the garbage out wearing just a beater and his shorts.  It smells great out too.  Like one of Tyke's friends actually.  It's really pleasant.  Tyke is quasi-watching Frasier right now as it is the series finale and the highlight show is playing.  They just had a clip of a chess match and now Tyke thinks he is going to go play himself at chess.  So that should be fun.  He better blog quickly then.  He has to go eat his ice cream too.  Busy night.  Busy indeed.  Today Tyke got 3rd period off which meant a little cake eating and dirty talk.  Just normal stuff you talk about when you are eating cake.  Tyke then played Lucky, the slave in Waiting for Godot, in English and got whipped and choked by a collar and really it was just a grand old time.  One time the leash broke so Tyke decided to ad-lib and he yelled 'I'm Free!' and ran out but the teacher didn't seem to think it was that funny.  Eh, screw her.  Speaking of her, Tyke saw her driving home from school when Tyke was leaving his house at like 2:50.  She had her arm out the window and looked like she was a butch cowboy, er, cowgirl.  But Physics was fun again today.  And then after school Tyke went home to get a microphone from his computer to work on planning Prom at Skippy's house.  So they did that and Tyke came home to do some more work and just hang out for a while.  Then he got dinner for him and his mom at JIB and ate that.  Then they talked about Ashland, and Tyke not being gay, and room situations, and not being gay.  Then Tyke watched the miraculous end, albeit annoying to Tyke as he does not want the Lakers to win, to the Lakers-Spurs game where Derek Fisher made an insane shot to win it 74-73.  Then Tyke came over here and blogged.  But he really wants to play Chess so there is no reason to write any more.  Here's a thought...what if Tyke, instead of writing how he does, used words like me?

      Everytime I try to fly away...ahhh yes the musical stylings of the lovely Britney Spears.  Tyke saw the music video to that before leaving for the AP test this morning as well as hearing it in 5th period today.  And now after the bath Tyke took a little while ago his mind reverted back to the last time he thought about a bath and that was watching Brit take one.  Well, now that that is out of the way, back to the day's events.  One more thing though.  Apparently there is some dissension between the quality of the blogs the past few weeks.  Tyke feels they are pretty good and Kinker agrees.  But today Amed voiced his opinion for the opposite.  So now Tyke doesn't know what to think.  Well, either way Tyke is going to keep writing them the same way he has been for the past couple of weeks.  And don't forget that you won't be immersed in Tyke's life from Tuesday to Friday of next week.  For that is when Tyke will be gone to Ashland, Oregon.  Ashland, apparently the pot-smoking capital of the Northwest.  Perfect place for Tyke of course, sarcasm for those of you who don't actually know Tyke personally which is at least one person.  The AP test was today.  The multiple choice was harder than Tyke was expecting/used to but the essays were fine.  Tyke got bored and drew all over his essay questions booklet.  He put Oscar the Grouch in the trash can and had Nader and the other lady crying.  And some other things as well.  Hopefully Sanders will like that.  After the AP test was over they realized they had 2 hours until they had to be back at school.  So Purdy drove her, Dotti, Tyke, Dr. Phil, and Amed to Dick's in Seattle.  And by the way, Amed's story about how Sanders mentioned loving dicks and how he should have brought her back some while smiling the whole time is just sickening.  Just so gross.  Seriously.  Ewww.  But Dick's was fun.  And cheap.  On the way back Amed didn't come with them so the car ride was less crowded and still fun.  They even listened to Christian songs cuz there was no more "basher" in the car.  Tyke got dropped back off at the Admin building and drove up by Kinker's house cuz they were playing poker for their lunch at his house and ordering pizza apparently but they weren't there.  So then Tyke went to school and got to class only a little late.  But he still took a nice long break and talked to Tina for a few minutes and then talked to Skippy about prom as well as Piggy J.  Hopefully he now knows who he is asking to prom.  That would make things easier.  But nonetheless prom was discussed.  And then Physics was easy cuz all they did was play music with odd things.  And no hw tonight makes things a lot nicer.  After school Tyke went to sorta work on the teacher impersonations for the senior assembly and then he came home to change and grab a bite to eat.  He then went down to South Cove to play ball with Doc P, Macaroon, Jew, Amed, etc.  Man, Tyke can apparently get on some people's nerves.  At least the big boy's nerves he got on.  But he's stupid anyway so it doesn't matter.  Not that Tyke would fight but he could take him.  He's all jiggly and slow.  Annnnyway, then Tyke, Doc P, and Macaroon went to Mickey D's for dinner.  They stayed there for a while and talked about quite a few things.  It was different than Tyke thought it would be.  It was just fun.  Then Tyke came home and took a bath which is what he started tonight with and now that he has come full circle, he can finish this blog off with.

      The culmination of a year of hard work.  Total dedication and tremendous time and effort spent studying for this one test...oh wait, that was last year.  This year is just an easy little AP test.  Yeah, AP Government test is tomorrow but that shouldn't be that bad.  It won't be fun writing the 4 essays but really they won't be all that brain-crunching (there's a weird picture).  The multiple choice part will be fine.  And the best part is that they should get out by like 11-11:30 meaning that they will get at least an hour and a half to have lunch.  They don't have to be back at school until like 1.  And Tyke still might come back late.  Cuz hey, he can.  Oh, back to the actual events of today.  Well, there weren't really many events of today so maybe that is a bad segway (hehe, that was in the Trivial Pursuit game on Saturday).  But anyway, Tyke found out his grade in AP English today. It shows that not working until the last minute doesn't necessarily mean that you will be able to pull off what you want.  He has a 67.1% in there right now.  He was hoping for at least 69.5% but he is quite a bit off from that.  How this happened, he doesn't know really know since Amed seems to have done almost the exact same amount of work in there since they both started working and they started with basically the same grade and yet he has a full 2.5% higher than Tyke.  Hmmm...odd.  So Tyke might need to try to get the aid of Big or Little Twigg to help pilfer the deficiency that will be coming in the mail when Tyke is in Ashland next week.  That could still not work though.  Hopefully all goes well.  Tyke, Amed, and Doc P got out of English about 5 minutes early again today.  So they went to JIB and Tyke got the ever-so-filling Bacon Ultimate meal.  That is a monstrously mmmmm meal.  It takes all of Tyke's 132 pound frame to handle all the meat and cheese.  What a delicacy it is though.  In Physics Tyke was a little worried about having to present a problem but he got lucky and didn't have to.  And although the quiz was hard he didn't mind taking it all that much.  But after school he didn't really have much fun for a while.  He did re-burn a few CDs that he gave out and no longer had copies of though.  So now he has 3 more to add to his great compilation.  He still needs to re-burn the 70s mix though.  That was a fun couple of CDs.  Tyke was tired as usual and managed to fall asleep a couple of times once again.  Every Monday and Tuesday he seems to fall asleep at least once.  It's a new tradition.  But he talked to his mom about England and how they have a house set up for the first week and a half they are there.  Speaking of England, at the soccer game at night Tyke and Mandy sat next to each other and they chatted briefly about Tyke going to England and about how Mandy might get to as well.  That would be really cool.  They might get to see each other there.  Odds are it won't happen but if it does it would be awesome.  But back to Tyke, haha.  He had some nice faJITAS for dinner and they were tasty.  Then after that he got some papers signed and came back online.  All of a sudden he got an urge to go to the soccer game at Sly Lion because the weather was nice and it would still be fun.  So he talked to Kinker and after a weird little debate (they weren't on opposite sides so it wasn't really a debate per se, but they were debating whether or not to go) and they decided to go.  Tyke drove after Kinker got to his house and they got there just as Kramm was scoring the one and only goal.  They didn't see it though.  Tyke and Kinker talked to a few Issy's and then talked to Mandy for most of the time.  After the game they went over to the Sly Lion side and saw the Issy traitors Purdy and Haras.  Tyke talked with C-Biscuit and BNelly for a little bit as well.  But then Tyke and Kinker left.  The funny part about leaving though is right when Tyke and Kinker got in the car and started it.  Tyke had the CD in that had Eamon's 'Fuck It' on there and it just so happened to be cued up that when Tyke started the car the speakers played "Fuck you you ho, I don't want you back."  Kinker was in the middle of saying something when they played and it was quite funny.  A real hehe chuckler.  After they got back to Tyke's they checked each other's headlights because Tyke noticed that he thought his left one was not as bright as the right one, but the thought that it might be like that on purpose.  Like, maybe it is like that so that it doesn't blind the drivers coming the opposite way.  So they checked Kinker's but his weren't like Tyke's.  So they didn't really get an answer to their question.  Then Tyke tried to figure out what he was doing when Kinker flew over his house and Tyke's car wasn't there one day but he couldn't.  So Kinker is going to go back and check the picture he took of Tyke's house to see if Tyke's car really wasn't there.  It will be interesting to find out.  And then Tyke came inside and his mom asked him about prom.  And that was it.  Just prom.

      Blech.  Stupid rainy weather.  It is definitely not fun.  Ow...Tyke just bit off like half his thumb.  Some of the nail as well as like the skin-nail part and now it is bleeding profusely so Tyke will be typing one-handed for a little while.  And there was just a Snickers commercial on tv and now Tyke is really craving one.  Mmmm...mmmmmmm...*lip lick.  Well today has become a bit of an interesting day.  And that sentence pretty much formed itself so it really isn't all that true.  Today wasn't all that interesting.  Math had a few good jokes in it and weight training was gay because Tyke's shorts got jacked out of his locker sometime since Friday's class.  Only his shorts.  The shirt and shoes got left in there and it was locked up so that is gay.  White shorts with some blue on the side and drawstrings out the middle if you see them.  If you do see them just take them off of whoever is wearing them and immediately return them to Tyke.  And also tell him who was wearing the shorts so he can take action into his own hands.  3rd period was so stupid today.  The final practice AP test and then Tyke helped take some books to Ritzer's class.  The rest of the day was stupid.  And since it was raining pretty hard after school Tyke got wet and that wasn't fun.  Well his after school time hasn't been very interesting at all.  He's watched some TV, ate some food, taken a couple of pretty short naps, got called by the school notifying him of an absence from a class when he wasn't even absent.  Man, the school is just so retarded.  High school is so retarded.  Now that Tyke doesn't just blindly follow the rules like he used to, he has realized how idiotic some things are.  Ahem, grad project.  But Tyke told his mom about some stuff today that he wished he didn't.  Since his mom is sick he felt bad for her so he just decided to sit down and talk with her and he ended up talking about stuff where he either gave him "sage advice" or made it into a "Disney conversation," coined Tyke, or just making a big deal out of nothing.  Tyke didn't get in trouble or anything but it was just stupid stuff.  Tyke ate ice cream out of the carton again today and he wanted to drink some Fresca out of the bottle but he decided against it.  But it made him think about how when he is on his own he can do that stuff and not really care.  So that was kind of "smiley" to think about.  Smiley means something that is kind of fun and makes you smile.  Coining is fun.  Damnit, Tyke is getting really hungry at night.  But he doesn't have anything that he can just sit and snack on.  And he is way too lazy to try to make something.  He was hungry earlier so he decided he would make some soup.  Well, you know those soup cans with the pull-off tabs?  Yeah, those suck.  Tyke never can figure out how hard to pull them.  He always pulls too hard (could be his insane muscular build though) and this time he just ripped the shit off that little bitch.  Oh whoa, still haven't published this.  Haha...well yeah Tyke pulled the top off and it spilled like everywhere and it was a bitch to clean up.  But not has to start planning Prom.  This is hard work and is not something that Tyke likes.  He doesn't know where he's going to.

      25 more days of school.  After this week, 20.  That means 4 more weeks of school.  That is just remarkable.  Tyke has been going to school without even thinking about graduating for about 13-14 years now and it has just begun to sink in that he is graduating.  While he was driving up to Cougar Mountain today he really thought about it when he saw another car.  He doesn't remember now what it was about the car that made him realize it but he did notice it.  But that wasn't the first event of Tyke's day so he better back up for a second.  Tyke woke up a little pooped but he didn't think that he should just sit in bed and sleep so he got out and came online.  Maniak got a basketball game going so Tyke decided to join in.  Dr. Phil, Amed, K-caj, Fejj, and Macaroon all joined the boys in their game.  Tyke certainly wasn't playing very well.  After the game he came home and really didn't do anything productive for the rest of the day.  He saw his mom only once and that was for dinner because she is laid up in bed with what is most likely strep throat.  And folks, strep throat sucks.  If you had forgotten, Tyke has had it at least 2wice and it is just sooo uncomfortable until you get the antibiotics.  But that still takes a littl while.  Well after Tyke's BBQ'd steak, baked potato, and caesar salad he got ready for Refuge (put on shoes) and waited for Dotti to pick him up.  Refuge is winding down now.  Although Tyke hasn't been to it all that much he does like it and it's too bad he won't get to after this year.  But it certainly has opened Tyke up and the social aspect of it isn't too shabby either, ;).  Tyke and Ekul sat next to each other and commented on how the one song was played like 5 different times.  It must have been a 15-20 minute song.  It was funny.  But anyway, Dotti drove Tyke home and he got some ice cream and a cookie and got back online but nobody stayed on so he has just been blogging for a little while.  And watching Harry Potter cuz it's on ABC. Although he does have the movie as well, but that's ok.  This week shouldn't be too bad.  Wednesday is the AP Gov test and other than that he just has to think about Physics and sorta Math.  But English should be a snap.  With Senyohl ya never know though.  Let's just hope that Tyke gets go somewhere he wants to go.

      Although you can't tell, Tyke's blog is a little different now.  At least how he updates it.  So it will take a little time to get used to.  But today didn't take any getting used to.  Ow!!  Tyke just bit his cheek with two of his canine teeth in the exact same place as he did earlier today.  All because of the super delectible cookie he was eating.  Today was a productive day for Tyke.  He got up a little bit before noon and decided he would do some good stuff around the house.  First he got the vacuum from upstairs and went at his downstairs floor with it.  He did a bang up job on it and vacuumed all he felt like doing.  Then he took the mats from his bathroom and vacuumed them.  Then he washed the floor of his bathroom and cleaned everything else up.  Tyke worked up a nice little sweat from all of his manual labor he forced himself to do.  Afterwards he got some stuff for his mom cuz she was sick but spent much of the day just lounging around the house and working out.  He worked out much more later on that night.  Tyke's dad went to the Mariners game and since his mom was sick Tyke went to Taco Time and got dinner for himself and his mom.  He also dropped by Blockbuster to drop something off and look for a game but he didn't see what he wanted.  So he came home and chowed down on his burrito.  The burrito had part of the soft crust a little crispy so he thought that he could just tear it off.  But so much of it was crispy that he ended up tearing the burrito basically in half and all of the meat spilled out.  So then he tried to eat it with a fork and dipping it into the hot sauce was a real struggle.  It ended up all going to where it needs to go (Tyke's stomach) but some of it took the long way there, by going onto the table and then onto a fork.  By the time Tyke actually finished the burrito he was hardly hungry enough, or in the mood to, eat the rest of his Mexi-fries so he forfeited them.  Kinker came over at about 7 and then was joined by Amed and later Macaroon.  They busted Risk out again and this time they had a draft for the countries.  Tyke took all of Australia as well as much of the Far East.  He ended up having a hell of a time trying to control Asia though and ended up deciding to retreat and just hold onto his Australian lands.  But then came a shift in the game.  Kinker had the brilliant idea to team up and take Macaroon out of the game because he would be getting quite a few armies on the next turn.  So they all ganged up on him and fairly and quickly took him out of the game.  All because he decided to spare Amed's one last country on his previous turn, Amed got to go back and take out a lot of Macaroon.  It was quite fun for all involved.  All.  After Risk they played Trivial Pursuit.  They showcased their limited knowledge of life but Tyke did end up winning.  Cuz he is the best.  And now it is all over.  Tomorrow Tyke is going to Refuge and is going out to dinner with his family.  Either that or his mom isn't cooking.  They might not go out though cuz she is sick.  But, it will all be up to her.  Tyke listened to some good music tonight.  Bob Seger and the BeeGees rule.  Will you.

      Tyke's first full day in Washington since Monday has been, what's the word...supersuckygaydumb.  Yeah, thats a word.  Waking up on his own before 11 was a bit of a surprise since Tyke was expecting that he would just be asleep for a really long time.  He did almost nothing all day.  At 12 something he and his mom talked about some stuff.  Mainly school.  Tyke has to talk to Gretch on Monday and really that doesn't mean anything.  What he really has to do is figure out what he can tell his mom that will assuage her troubled mind and at least somewhat make his situation calmer.  Right now he is wishing that he didn't sorta tell his mom that he has turned in every assignment this semester.  Cuz that definitely isn't true and will most likely end up hurting him.  He is gonna have to bring up that fact because he can't risk his mom finding out what his grade was last semester.  It is going to be tough to make sure that doesn't come up.  But if he really gives his mom the details of his current situation that should help him out.  Cuz she knows that Tyke isn't working now.  Now he just has to keep her from knowing the rest of his follies.  Luckily, the only things that Tyke has to hide from his parents (mother really) is his schoolwork.  He doesn't do drugs, drink, or have sex so he has nothing else to be worried about.  It's too bad though that the deficiency did come home.  It would have been much easier to just have his poor grades come home in the summer and either not have them be seen or just tell them that he didn't work at all second semester.  At least then she couldn't find out any other bad things about his schoolwork.  Now she could.  And it's not like Tyke can do much with the last 15 days of school.  Stupid school.  Making Tyke not have fun.  And he still hasn't really started his speech yet.  He needs to start tonight on it.  Right after that conversation he was invited to a little bball game so he joined in on that at Cougar Ridge.  Tyke showcased his talents early on but he lost his touch as the games progressed.  And (as Tyke dances to Night Fever) he also lost focus.  Tyke, Amed, Dr. Phil, Piggy J, K-Caj, and Macaroon were the players and all but K-Caj talked about prom after the games were over.  They just sorta chatted about it, not really deciding anything other than they probably will be taking quite a few cars.  At least 2 couples will be taking their own cars.  Tyke could of course but he won't since he is with Skippy.  Speaking of Skippy, he called today and they talked a little about prom.  But just dinner times and picture times.  So nothing all that cool.  Tyke wishes prom would just come though.  Cuz then a lot of stupid stuff would be over with.  And school would almost be over with.  Just a couple of finals and then graduation.  Damn, today was stupid.  Why can't fun times like Ashland last longer?  That was a short 4 days.  Tyke only has one more full week though...whoa, is that true?  It might be.  Memorial Day is off of course and he has half days coming up so yeah, this might be the last week.  Once his speech is over on Monday the day will be alright.  Actually, once lunch comes it will be a good day.  Cuz he will still be wearing his suit and then he gets to go get his tux which is gonna be fun.  And Purdy is coming so it will be more fun.  Sighhhh, suckygay right now.  It is also after 10 which means Tyke wants to go to sleep soon but he has to do some of his speech he thinks.  He really hates doing it all on Sunday.  He already has decided that the only thing he is doing on Sunday is Refuge though.  That's it.  And hopefully that is fun cuz it is the last one.  It is bring your parent night but Tyke doesn't think his mom will be coming and his dad won't be.  Not a great day.  But it is definitely a Bee Gees night again.  The Greatest Hits CDs are just so good.  They are perfect late night music.  Although alone they sorta lose some of the flavor.

      Tyke is home...home sweet, actually it isn't all that great to be back home.  Because now that Tyke is home he is missing out on all of these things he did over the trip and thus that makes him sad.  Here's how it started.  Tuesday morning Tyke got up and got ready and all of that good shit.  He tried to post a final blog on here but his computer sorta froze as he was trying to do so, thus he figured it was a sign telling him that he should just let it go.  He got to the school just as Purdy and Dotti were getting all of their stuff onto the bus so he put his on the bus and then went to Physics to turn in his homework.  Senor 1/2 seemed a little bit mad yet again and most likely he was like that this week but Tyke really doesn't know.  Anyway, the gang all got on the bus and Tyke and Amed sat next to each other in front of Karla and Bean who were in front of Purdy and Dotti.  The seating on the way there wasn't perfect but it was fun.  Tyke and Amed had many many good jokes and conversations.  At times some of the bus folk got a little rowdy and pretty annoying to Tyke but he trudged through it by staring out the window sometimes and just having some fun with Amed, Shirley Temple (new name for person who might have a name but this one just came to Tyke cuz it's funny), and Macaroon.  Tyke and Macaroon really didn't hang out much over the trip but they did talk sometimes.  The bus ride to Ashland, Oregon is a long one.  9 hours people.  9 hours.  But it was a bus that had reclining seats and a bathroom so this was definitely a luxury.  Tyke was never really uncomfortable or sore like he sometimes is on car rides.  He felt pretty eased and relaxed for almost the entire time.  They stopped off at Woodburn, Oregon (about 45 minutes from Portland??) for lunch.  Tyke, Amed, Shirley, and Macaroon went to KFC/Wendy's for lunch and since it was Oregon this was the first time in a while that Tyke had been affected by the lack of sales tax.  And when there is no sales tax, it makes purchases a lot easier.  It was splendid knowing how much everything would cost and thus there were fewer pennies used in many places.  Tyke loved it.  After eating the gang walked around the city a little before Tyke decided he really wanted to go to Wal-Mart.  This was both Tyke's and Amed's first trip into a Wal-Mart and boy was it an eye-opener.  Blue America met Red America here.  The Blue Americans from Issaquah entered Anytown, USA with flags waving and patriotism abound.  Wal-Mart is huge!  It is bigger than Farget even and Farget is pretty large.  They walked around and listened to some music, looked at Mary-Kate and Ashley and bought some food before heading off to the bus again.  The next stop was a rest area farther south in Oregon where some of the guys got off and played frisbee.  At this point Tyke had been getting annoyed by some of the bus riders and he really needed to get off and just cool off some.  Once they got back on the bus everything calmed down and Tyke had a much more enjoyable ride.  Final destination was reached at about 5 something in Tyke's recollection.  They saw much of the city and finally got to their hotel where Tyke met a mini-roadblock.  Tyke had planned to be sleeping in Purdy, Dotti, Karla, and Bean's room so they wanted to get adjacent rooms so as to make everything easier.  Well, this wasn't easy to do because they got their room keys at different times.  So Tyke had to find the group next to the ladies and convinced them to trade keys with Tyke's group.  And they luckily did.  So everyone got in there and that was fun.  That night Tyke and MormoMan got together with Purdy, Karla, Dotti, and Bean and they went out on the town.  It was about a 20-25 minute walk to the town/play theater so they got some exercise in.  They ate dinner at Pasta Piatti the first night and they were charged 4 extra sodas by the fucking waitress!  She was a bit of a ho-bag.  Oh, but that reminds Tyke.  Right before the crowd left the hotel the ladies decided to play a game where you get a point if a member of the opposite sex (member haha...makes it sound like a club or something) shows interest in you basically.  Well Tyke said that he wanted to play and at first the girls decided they would give Tyke some advantages cuz it is way harder to win as a guy than a girl usually.  Whoops, Tyke just left the computer for a while to talk with his mom and dad about their trip to Europe and now Tyke found out that they are going to take the Chunnel from France to London which means Tyke gets to be underwater going 180 mph in a train.  That's just cool.  Tight really.  Back to the game though.  At the restaurant that first night Tyke wasn't even trying hard to get a point in the game but the waitress came up behind Tyke and as she slowly walked by Tyke she caressed his back and kind of trailed off with her fingers.  Tyke wasn't even paying attention.  And she wasn't just trying to get around him either.  But Tyke did get a point for that and he ended up winning the game as he also got checked out by 2 girls, says Purdy, when he was walking in town.  He didn't get any points for that but he still one with the 1 point.  After dinner they went to bookstores and other stores before finally heading back to Safeway and then the hotel.  Tyke and Mormo Man spent the night in the ladies' room.  Tyke slept in between the two beds on the floor and it wasn't too bad.  Being able to spend the night in their room made the nights really fun.  Amed and Shirley got to spend the nights in their own beds because they didn't have to share them with Tyke and MM.  Mr. Merrit and Senyohl both did "room checks" at night but they didn't actually go into the rooms or ask if there were people in the room that didn't belong there.  So it was just so easy to sleep there.  And they had some very interesting conversations.  Conversations that most Mormons probably don't have, if that gives you any clue.  That was a blast.  In the morning they got up and did a bunch of shopping before the first play.  The play was Comedy of Errors.  It was ok but Tyke didn't like it.  Tyke sat next to Purdy for this play, and everyone hereafter though so it wasn't like the experience wasn't enjoyable.  The play just wasn't.  After the play came more shopping (man, there sure was a lot of shopping but Tyke didn't really complain cuz it wasn't that bad).  Tyke bought only one non-food item the whole trip.  A $5 necklace that he liked and felt it made him even more "pretty boy."  Cuz that is what Tyke is...a pretty pretty boy.  The second play was Henry VI.  It wasn't much fun but once again Tyke and Purdy made it fun.  The actors would spit a lot.  *Tyke puts Bee Gees CD in the CD player.  Here's some stuff that sorta got Tyke's group-the rebels of the entire group-bootlegging (albeit somewhat minimal), whispering, laughing, mocking, pussy signs, etc.  It was fun to do, well all but the bootlegging that is, but it still sorta got them in trouble the next day.  That and some of their morning escapades.  The night was pretty much over after the play.  Not all that much went down that night.  Talking of course but some of the roommates, *ahem*Satan*ahem*.  There was a lot of hair petting and massages through this trip.  Like sitting out in the park in a hair petting circle.  Total hippie.  Totally cool.  But during the night the room, which now added Tyronious and Trewfanator to it, decided to not go to the Q&A with some actors so they just slept in late.  They watched TV and stayed in the hotel room til about noon.  Then they got a little snack and went to the theater where Gretch (what they called Senyohl the entire trip) decided to talk to them.  She basically said 2 sentences to them, she was mad though, and then just stood there.  Nobody said anything until Tyke thinks Karla said, "sorry."  And that was really funny but Tyke decided not to laugh.  Really though she didn't say anything bad to them or punish them or anything.  Some of the gang talked to Al (Merritt) but he was just saying how they had nothing to worry about or anything like that and Tyke made sure to finish the conversation with "Thanks Al, we like you!"  Oh man, Al is fun.  Too bad he is still sorta a teacher so they couldn't just talk to him about everything.  But the first play of Thursday was really really good.  It was very controversial and Gretch didn't prepare any of the students for it but it ruled still.  It was a two-man play with two black guys.  There was tons of cursing, masturbation, porn, gambling, shooting, death, crying, it was phenomenal.  Best play Tyke has seen in a while.  Even if it wasn't a great message, so say some people, the play was just so marvelously acted that Tyke really felt like you had to respect it nonetheless.  But that play definitely sparked debate.  Among the IHS students too.  That got a little dicey at times but it was fine.  Tyke spent most of his time with MormoMan (for guys) and Purdy (for girls) but really it was just a big group hang out of Tyke, MormoMan, Purdy, Dotti, Karla, and Bean.  After the play they walked around town and they sat on a grassy knoll eating really good chocolate and watching hippies freak Tyke out.  One hairy-armpitted chick went up to this guy who was walking his toddler around and asked if he could hug the boy.  She did and just picked him up and went all hippie-crazy on him.  It was just awkward.  Then later on Tyke noticed that the father had decided to take off his shirt and tie and was walking around shirtless with the baby.  Just picture the 60s.  Thats what it seemed like.  And then finally came the last play at 8.  That was A Raisin in the Sun.  It was fine.  Tyke wasn't exactly in the mood for yet another play.  But Purdy made it more enjoyable and Dotti gave Tyke a few pets to keep him awake so he still enjoyed the experience.  After the final play they boarded the bus to go back to the hotel.  Tyke got a little bit of his all of the massages he had been giving out returned but he still provided more anyway.  He likes giving massages and even more petting hair and rubbing heads and forearms.  It is double-pleasurable usually.  For Tyke and the recipient.  Even if Tyke doesn't particularly think he is that great at giving massages that's ok.  Better than nothing, right?  Well that night Tyke and MormoMan thought that they would be sleeping in their own room but they ended up just going and staying in the ladies room again.  So every night they slept there.  This time though Tyke and MM slept in one of the beds.  They just fit 4 people in it.  That way the petting could continue and then just everyone would drift off to sleep.  Hopefully all of the "petting" doesn't make it sound like a huge orgy or anything or that there was anything going down over there...it was just friends helping friends.  But at one point Tyke woke up Friday morning to find that to his right was Purdy and to his left was MormoMan whom Tyke had his hand on for some reason.  And Dotti was on the ground.  Tyke was like...ummmm...what did I do last night?  Then he remembered pretty quickly what happened but it was still weird that he was touching MM cuz he wasn't at any other point.  Whatever, it's just another hot blonde guy.  Nothing wrong with that.  Friday morning was the last time in Ashland.  They all got packed up and got back on the bus.  This time Tyke and Amed sat closer to the party in Dotti, Purdy, Karla, Bean, and MormoMan.  The ride was fun. Tyke had a lot of energy and was making himself laugh a lot cuz he thought he was funny.  Hopefully others did too.  He sang a lot of songs and Tank sang some great renditions of "I Believe in a Thing Called Love."  He really rocks at that.  It's a pleasure to hear.  They went to a rest area again and played some frisbee before finally getting to Woodburn for lunch again.  Tyke and the gang ate at BK before heading to Wal-Mart for Tyke's second trip in his life and second in 4 days as well.  It was great.  They tried to figure out ways to get kicked out but they never did.  They had some mini-races on mini-girl's bikes.  And Amed and MormoMan played volleyball over one of the aisles.  But the best part about that Wal-Mart trip was the end where Amed took a picture of these two hicks wearing matching tie-dye shirts.  It was freaky.  And hella funny.  They went well with some of the people-watching pictures that Karla had been taking.  Karla's awesome.  She laughed at Tyke's stupid jokes the whole trip.  And Tyke's large tongue too.  And of course Dotti being there for Tyke and rubbing his head and keeping him happy.  She sparkled for Tyke.  And then Purdy kept Tyke smiling the whole time with her jokes and caresses and lovely aura with her.  This trip was splendid.  On the way back Tyke was pretty sleep so he just looked out the window for a while and then Purdy joined him and they both kinda drifted off but now Tyke is finally home.  He came home to find the deficiency that Little Twigg was supposed to pilfer, right on the kitchen table.  So yeah, that didn't work.  His mom had some nice comments for him and now, although he isn't in any real trouble, he will be watched with a more watchful eye.  Which could occasionally mean a day where Tyke isn't quite as free as usual.  But that could be a good thing.  Come on, Tyke is sooooo lazy a little work can't hurt all that bad?  Shiit, it has started.  Tyke is thinking he should do work.  Now Tyke gets to look forward to baseball tomorrow, doing his grad speech, and his tux shopping date with Purdy on Monday.  So things are still going to be fun but with only 15 days of high school left, Tyke's days are really winding down.  And so is this blog.  Here is the most important thing to come away with from this blog.  Tyke enjoyed Ashland, was glad he went, is content with the past, happy for the future, and longing nonetheless.  This is just going to be a blur for Tyke, these last few weeks.  Prom is coming up too and that is going to be sooooooooooooooo much fun.  Tyke is really really excited for it.  Tyke is going with who he wants to and that means it will be simply awesome.  Tyke.  Simply awesome.

      Folks, here it is.  The streak will be broken after today.  And a sad day it is indeed.  Actually, Tyke might post a mini-post tomorrow morning before he leaves if he has time but in all reality the streak will be broken.  Hey, here's something that Tyke would appreciate...if somebody could go back and find when Tyke's streak started.  Tyke knows it goes back into November but he doesn't know how far and he could be wrong still.  But Tyke hasn't always posted a blog on every consecutive day, for instance he blogged Thursday on Thursday night and then Friday on Saturday morning (like 1 AM).  So if someone wants to spend a while doing that, thanks.  Just leave a comment saying the consecutive days number and that would be so greatly appreciated.  But other than that, this is sort of sad.  Tyke has blogged about every single day of 2004.  And...wow Tyke really is sad about his blog not being blogged for at least 2 days.  This blog is truly a feat in Tyke's mind.  Who else has the dedication to write something every single day with made up names and ideas, and spend at least 30 minutes every day doing so.  This has come at the sacrifice of homework, chatting, and food.  Tyke sometimes starves himself for a while just to get his blog done.  It is his baby and he loves it.  In a few weeks it will be grown to the point that it can survive on its own for 3 weeks while Tyke is in Europe.  There is a chance that Tyke can either do some email, or maybe a blog while he is in Europe, but don't be expecting it very often.  Ok, back to today's events.  Tyke got up at 6 and finished off his portfolio.  Then he came to school (in his HOT pink shirt) and had a fun day.  He didn't really have to do anything all day.  In 2nd period Tyke talked with that junior girl for much of the period, just about things like her boyfriend and relationships and it was a really stimulating conversation.  Maybe it was just cuz they were talking in weight training and that's a weird environment but still, it was a little weird, but in a good way.  Then Tyke put his pink shirt back on and went to Gov where they were just doing presentations and Amed asked Dolores to prom in his speech.  It was funny.  After that was English and it was sorta stupid but whatever.  Actually when Tyke and Amed acted out Waiting for Godot, they did a good job.  Tyke really felt comfortable being Estragon (Tyke pronounces it Estrogen to be phunny).  It was fun as well.  Then came lunch and Kinker's prom asking.  Then the day was basically over. After school Tyke played bball with Amed and Dr. Phil and were later joined by Piggy J and Big Twigg.  Tyke gave Little Twigg the key to his mailbox so that he could intercept Tyke's deficiency come Wednesday.  The gang talked mostly about prom and those kinds of things while Tyke tried to dominate the games.  Then Tyke came home and got food and packed stuff.  He is an over-packer for sure.  And a little metrosexual as he is taking 2 belts on the trip.  Yeah, he does like clothes and being neat.  But he's far from hardcore metrosexuality.  And now comes that part in the blog.  It is the denoument.  The action is ceasing.  The blog streak winds down.  It has been a blast.  And Tyke will take this opportunity to thank every single person who has ever read this blog because it's cool.  Tyke likes an audience and a good audience brings out the ham in Tyke.  And not ham as in a Jewish joke (inside joke).  So hold tight and hope for a quick return to Tyke The Tremendous!

      Can Tyke just say wow for a minute?  Wow.  Today has been pretty damn awesome considering how incredibly Tyke-hectic it has been.  And now Tyke just has to blog/talk to people online who are either online and talking to Tyke or sorta online but not talking to Tyke.  It makes sense if you are Tyke so just go along with it.  But here's how today went.  Tyke got up and worked on his grad project portfolio first off.  He did the letter pretty quickly and then started to compile things so he figured it would be quick.  But he also knew that his printer was on the fritz so it might not be so smooth.  Well then things got said and Tyke decided to go help out Kinker and Tyronious with some prom stuff and maybe help Tyke out while doing so.  Well Tyke didn't get any help out of it but it was fun.  They went to Party 4 Less and got 4 dozen balloons for Tyronious with a dozen of the blown up ones in Tyke's car so he couldn't see out the back.  Then they went to Kinko's where Tyke was going to print some of his stuff off but he couldn't do it for free he didn't think so he just decided to not do it.  Then he went back and they watched some of Tyke's prom video that he made the night before.  After that they went to Ted Meyer's for some stuff and then to Costco to pick up a pizza.  They ordered it on the phone while standing in line so as to get it quicker.  Then they went up to Tyke's house to eat it while they waited for Trewfanator to leave her house so Tyronious could go fill the room with all the balloons and rose petals and such.  They finally did that and it was fun and tiring but then as they were leaving Trewf returned without their realization cuz Tyronious missed the text message he received.  So they sorta hid but couldn't really and it was just really awkward.  And then they stayed there for longer than Tyke would have liked cuz he still had to do his portfolio.  So finally they left but then they came to Tyke's and watched the prom video Tyke made last night for Purdy.  It is really pretty tight.  Well Tyke then called Purdy to try to see if he could set her up at night with the video and she was able to come pick him up.  So they went to Refuge together and Ekul was there and he performed a couple of songs and they were hilarious!!  He did a great job.  And 2 of the bands were really good too.  So after Refuge, Purdy drove Tyke back to his house and then he invited her in for a little bit to watch "this video" and she said she would.  So Tyke got it all ready for her and Tyke's portfolio mess was everywhere so it looked like just a normal day but then he showed the video.  And she really seemed to enjoy it.  It made Tyke really feel great to hear her laugh and watch it so he definitely feels like it was a success.  So Tyke owes his sincerest gratitude to Skippy for doing an awesome job directing, Kinker for his ideas and sound mastery, and Macaroon for well...he didn't do anything but he was there.  So now the secret is finally out.  Tyke asked Purdy and he even used his blog somewhat secretively to ask her but he didn't tell her that.  And since she said she didn't know he was going to ask her he knows it is true.  The last word (or two in the first case) of 7 of the last 8 or 9 blogs spells out Will you go to prom with me Purdy.  Tyke just felt like doing it and he knew if he didn't draw attention to it, it wouldn't be that noticeable.  So yeah, go back and look at that.  Well after Tyke walked her out, he went back to working on the portfolio.  Tyke's dad was finally able to fix the printer so Tyke was able to print everything off and hole punch it so now he just needs to put it together tomorrow morning and that won't be that hard.  So now Tyke is really excited to go to prom with Purdy but he still has to go through the rest of the planning and that is becoming a chore.  But now, Tyke can be excited that he has asked Purdy.  And that is all Tyke needs to be excited about for now.  But now Tyke really thinks he should go to bed.  He most likely has missed out on a lot of details but forgive him, for his head has been working hard today.  Oh jeez...Tyke just got called and more weird stuff has happened...wow

      Tyke has Sharpie ink all over his chest and back.  Yeah, long story.  Which wouldn't take long at all to divulge, but it's just a messy story...get it?  Ink=messy!!  Well anyway, today was fun cuz it was Saturday and Tyke didn't do anything mentally strenuous.  He got up after 11 and watched TV for a while before coming online and talking about Prom stuff and tux shopping for the day.  At 1:30 Tyke, Amed, Macaroon, and K-Caj all met up at the Factoria Mall where they looked at tuxes.  Tyke became a rep so he should be able to get a pretty damn cheap tux or even free.  He didn't actually get his tux yet but he's gonna get all white again.  But yeah, if you need a tux come to Tyke and he'll give you a card so that you can help him out when you get your tux.  Tyke will try to help you out some other way too.  But he won't give you head like K-Caj offered.  Ewww.  After that Dr. Phil met up with the gang and they went to K-Caj's house to play some Halo.  Then Tyke went home and had dinner with his family at DC's Steakhouse up on the plateau and they talked about their trip to Europe.  Then Tyke came home and Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Kinker, Skippy, and Amed all came over.  They played some rousing games of Taboo and every single time Tyke's team won.  That shows how good Tyke is at Taboo.  So pick Tyke for your partner.  The last game it was Tyke and Skippy teamed up and they had 0 after Skippy gave clues because he isn't exactly the best clue-giver.  Well Amed had thought that the game was over once he beat Macaroon and Dr. Phil's score.  Tyke had to get 9 to tie.  Well he went on a roll and got 11 right without any minus points and ended up winning.  It was great.  Tyke is great.  Tyke is tight.  That's tight.  All night long the gang thought about prom stuff and group situations and all of that mumbo jumbo.  It actually set things up really well and they seem to be pretty set on their ways now.  But now they have decided that they probably need to do pre-everything pictures at 4-4:15.  That means that everyone has to be ready by then.  It is unknown yet whether or not that causes a problem.  Hmmm...let's hope not.  Anyway, they filmed a really good video after playing taboo and that is why Tyke has Sharpie pen all over him.  You'll see the video sometime.  It's good.  Super hot good.  Super hot t-shirt off good.  Tomorrow might kinda suck cuz Tyke has to do the Grad Project Portfolio all tomorrow.  Which is gay.  Gay gay.  Bye bye.

      Saturday has been an odd day.  Tyke had a haircut scheduled for 11AM but he managed to turn off his alarm in a state of half-sleep and doesn't remember doing so but nonetheless he woke up after 11.  He heard the phone ring and realized it was late.  He managed to get it rescheduled for later in the day though.  Tyke then used his time in between to play some MVP Baseball which is a tight game.  And then he finally left, in his brother's car, for his haircut.  He got back and at 3 Amed, Dr. Phil, and K-Caj came over to film the English final.  What they did is take the Talking Sex show and make it into a talk show with guests coming on the show.  They used Oedipus, Stephen from Portrait of an Artist, Mersault from The Stranger, Ivan Ilych, and Hamlet.  Tyke played Ivan and Hamlet.  Oedipus was played by K-Caj and this was the only one that took more than one take to complete decently.  He kept messing up and didn't have his part down but finally they got something adequate enough to finish.  The rest was pretty good but it isn't all that funny or exemplary.  Just good enough.  After that they went to Teriyaki Bistro for dinner.  Then they came back up and played a few games of Shithead followed up by the game of global domination, or Risk.  Although K-Caj really had no idea how to play, he won.  And Amed got very angered and tried to stop the advice of Tyke and Dr. Phil but in the end it was not enough.  Dr. Phil was spread so thin that he couldn't really do anything and Tyke made a blunder in trying to take over Africa and South America at the same time rather than just control Asia like he actually could have.  But in the end K-caj's army was just too much.  The most retarded move he made was to stop his army from taking over the entire world because he didn't think he could although he had like 13 armies left and all he needed was Australia.  So he stopped and waited a turn to get even more build-up and Dr. Phil (who stockpiled armies in Japan only for like 5 turns) managed to outlast Tyke and die last.  But Tyke had the second most dominant force in the game behind K-caj.  In the end, he was obliterated from the earth and it meant nothing.  After this they played Taboo.  Tyke's team won every time but when he was with K-caj who was a newbie to the game and improved every turn but still isn't the best.  He is hilarious to watch give clues because he gets so nervous and loud and flustered when he does it.  But Tyke is still the best.  Ahh yes, it's great being the best.  And now Tyke's night is over at 10PM.  So he will go grab some food and then probably just play MVP before heading off to bed.  It was a good, productive day.  And tomorrow isn't even the last day of the weekend so this is looking good.  Maybe some bball will arise tomorrow.  Let's just see what happens.

      What a great day.  And if for no other reason, simply because it is Friday and high school is almost over.  Just 10 more times will Tyke have to go to Issaquah High School.  And that is wonderful.  But Tyke still did have to go through today before getting there.  He got up and did his math homework as is ritual for everytime he has homework.  On his drive to school it was pouring out and when Tyke got to school he noticed the school bus parked outside the gym and he assumed it was the baseball bus as they were supposed to leave at 7:15 for the state semifinal.  But that definitely got cancelled.  Hardcore cancelled.  And then so did the 4A game(s) tonight so that means that Yakima is the place to be this weekend for the state championship for baseball.  And Kinker, etc, should win it cuz they are cool and Tyke goes to school with them.  And Kinker's tight.  In 1st period Tyke just got to talk with Maniak and Jew the whole period cuz hardly anyone was present.  And then weight training was a blast cuz they played Bump again.  And Tyke wasn't able to dominate.  Although he just kept draining 3's the person in front of him did the same until finally Tyke got screwed by his mere place in line.  He would be the first one up when a shot was taken and then if he missed the person behind him often would make it.  Just one of those luck of the draw things.  And the junior girl made her usual conversation with Tyke and that was fun.  Then came 3rd period meaning the final in-class presentations so now they are just putzing around for the next 2 days.  4th period was just a minor challenge for Tyke and Amed.  They went to Tyke's car before class started and dropped their bags off there so that they didn't have to take them out of class when they left early, ingenious idea of course.  Then they just waited for a great time to leave and Tyke said he was going to the bathroom while Amed just left and happened to time it as somebody was coming in so he wasn't expected.  They left 35 minutes early and went to Chili's for lunch.  After that they just drove around for a little before going back to school.  It was fun and relaxing just having the two of them.  It was cozy ;).  5th and 6th periods aren't really worth mentioning.  After school Tyke came home and got some food as the storm started.  It poured insane amounts of water down.  Tyke decided to drive his brother's car (he is at a wedding in San Fran this weekend if Tyke remembers right) to Cougar Ridge for basketball with Maniak, Tyronious, Dr. Phil, Amed, and Macaroon.  This wasn't a great pick at one point.  Right after Tyke got on the freeway all of a sudden he started to notice he wasn't seeing very well.  He thought it was just the rain so he slowed down a little bit.  But that didn't help.  So then he noticed he really wasn't being able to see.  And finally he was completely blind in front of him.  The windshield had completely fogged over and Tyke was driving blindly only knowing what was behind him in a car he hadn't driven in months.  Now this was a pretty freaky experience.  Finally Tyke rubbed the fog off the windshield with his hand and changed up the defroster so that it actually worked and he was fine from then on.  But those few seconds where he was blind he really realized how dangerous that was.  He easily could have hit something, spun out (he did go through big puddles of water without seeing them so he knows that could have made him lose control), or just gone off the road.  So that was quite a little experience.  Then they played basketball for a few hours which was fun.  And then Tyke went home.  And ate dinner.  And watched basketball.  And then planned the night.  DCups came over along with Kinker, Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Maniak, and Fejj.  Maniak was a true gentleman and brought over MVP Baseball which is hella tight.  They played poker and Tyke lost 10 bucks (his second buy-in he went all in the first hand and lost but it wasn't a big deal) but then he just played MVP and he really loves that game.  If he wasn't dropping $300 for prom right now he would go out and get it for sure.  But he'll have to wait.  Maniak allowed him to borrow it though so that means Tyke can have some fun with it as long as "no jizz gets on it."  Graphic, but still a quote.  Tyke took on Dr. Phil after everyone left and the Cubs (Tyke) beat the Mariners (Dr. Phil) 4-2.  It was a good battle.  And now, everything is done and Tyke can finally sleep.  He's tired.  Later.

      Today was not all that normal of a day.  Tyke had to drive through the rain on his way to school and that is never that fun and also he wasn't really looking forward to the day ahead so he wasn't in a great mood to start off with.  In 1st period he left class (against his teacher's desire) to film the teacher impersonation of the librarian, or Shitty Mc"Shatt."  It actually turned out being good.  The funniest part was that right before the filming started, the librarian came in and asked what class they were in, told them to leave, and did like all of the things that he is best known for.  And they got him on tape doing so.  It was great.  He's such an ass that they don't really care that he most likely doesn't know they were taping.  But Tyke did his impersonation, he told people to get off computers, stop drinking non-water, to have a pass, and all the other Schatt-isms.  So all in all it wasn't too bad.  Then weight training was just like it has been for the last week.  And gov wasn't too bad either.  English was pretty weird today.  Tyke actually finished reading The Glass Menagerie in class today.  Quietly.  By himself.  So that was tight.  Tyke actually liked the play and it was joyous to just sit and read cuz Tyke hasn't really done that in a long time.  It's a shame but Tyke hasn't read a good book in quite some time.  They tried to leave really early but got shut down so they only got out like 5 minutes early and then went to McD's.  5th period involved Tyke waiting for Purdy to text him cuz he thought she was going to and then just leaving class to walk around for a while.  Then 6th period was just finishing up a lab and watching a Physics video.  And then the day was over.  Unfortunately for Tyke, although it is his choice, he has to go to school tomorrow but that's fine.  A lot of people will be gone so it should be an easy day.  Right after school at Tyke's house there was a Prom meeting that Tyke planned.  All 8 members of the group came: Tyke, Skippy, Amed, Maniak, Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Tyronious, and Piggy J.  Although they really didn't accomplish anything for a long time, Tyke finally got what he wanted.  The group to make some freaking decisions.  They called some hotels and decided on one of them for their final plan.  The Grand Hyatt Hotel.  It's gonna be tight.  They had to get 2 rooms, and there was no way to make them adjoined but that's ok, but the two rooms are going to be good.  It isn't all that expensive and since the hotel is nice, the rooms should be too.  Tyke is happy with this decision as he is tired of his house always being the place for everything.  The proximity is nice, but the clean-up is a bitch.  Tyke even had to clean up after the prom meeting they had for 2 hours, so just think about an all-night party.  Yeesh.  But yeah, hotel after prom.  That's gonna be fun.  Hopefully no obstacles will arise from here out.  Tyke's parents are almost totally on-board with the idea, or as totally on-board as they will get, so Tyke isn't worried about not being able to stay there.  And that is good.  It's gonna be fun spending the night with Purdy.  This afternoon/evening has passed by pretty quickly so Tyke is thinking he should go accomplish something.  But what?  Hmmm...nothing to do really.  Ok then.  Malibu will be taking away some of Tyke's friends this weekend but he will be able to occupy himself with filming the English final for at least one day this weekend.  And having Monday off is just sick.  Tyke hasn't decided if he's going to go to school on Tuesday but he really doesn't think he'll be able to get it excused so he will most likely have to come.  That's gay.  His parents really don't allow him any freedom when it comes to going to school/doing schoolwork.  That's annoying.  Luckily they are busy almost all the time so he at least gets to not do schoolwork without getting caught.  Ahhh the beauty of the double-income families of the 21st century.  Gotta love it.

      Well today was so stupid and unblogworthy that Tyke is going to blog before 7PM.  That is the earliest he has done his final blog in a long long time.  Nothing fun happened today.  Math wasn't fun.  Weight training was alright cuz Tyke won at bump yet again and the junior girl couldn't get him out.  Government was ok because of the first presentation.  English wasn't much fun but they did leave early and Tyke found out he now has a D+ instead of a D in there.  Lunch was fine.  5th period wasn't as bad as it usually is, just cuz it was shorter.  Physics wasn't much fun cuz of that damn bright light.  Oh yeah, Tyke also had to get up early to go to Physics (in the rain) to watch a stupid movie.  Purdy and Macaroon were there but it still wasn't fun.  Then after school Tyke didn't even talk to anyone.  He just got in his car.  He listened to some music as he drove home numb and barely focused on what he was doing.  He might have blinked twice the entire time.  He just sat there and stared straight ahead until he got home.  And then when he got home he just went downstairs, grabbed a little to eat, and sat staring mindlessly at Full House.  It was really pretty dumb.  Tyke wouldn't even describe himself as bored necessarily.  More of disappointed.  He hates when on days where he really shouldn't have anything to deal with, he just ends up not being in a good mood.  And there's nothing he can do.  Boy was that not fun.  Tyke talked to his mom about English tonight while eating dinner and that seems to be pretty much resolved.  Sounds like she might not even be calling Gretch.  But the result of the conversation was, "So Tyke what did you learn from this, if anything?"  Tyke gave the expected answer and that was that.  Then they just sat and ate dinner together.  And now Tyke realizes that he has to go read for English.  And that is stupid because the AP test was 2 weeks ago.  So why do stuff now?  They shouldn't be.  12 more days of school and they are just beginning to read something new.  Screw you Gretch.  Go ride your horse off a cliff.

      Oh hey!  How are you?  This is Tyke.  Oh, haha.  Yeah, you're right.  Today, is that what you want to know about?  Here ya go.  So today was Tuesday for those of you who aren't awake.  The last long day before the shortened Wednesday.  But that means that Tuesday is usually pretty damn long.  In weight training today Bland was actually working out and it was funny cuz he got really into it and was rolling up the sleeves of everyone and looking in the mirror and making weird faces.  It was freaky.  But other than that the class was normal.  Today in Gov everyone voted on Senior Class Hall of Fame.  There were a lot of categories.  Hopefully Tyke will win one.  He has received at least a few votes for multiple categories but that doesn't necessarily add up to a large margin.  Apparently one gov class thought that he and Purdy were a good match for Couple that Should have Been.  Well, yeahhhhhh.  Haha.  Tyke of course voted for himself and Tina for couple that should have been.  Not so much cuz he truly felt it at the moment but he did so because he said he would earlier this year when he tried to get others to do the same.  Some people renegged on that though so it was probably only Tyke who voted that way.  But whenever he couldn't think of a guy for a category, Tyke just put himself down.  For instance, exotic eyes.  He voted Haras for the female counterpart.  She should win that one.  And Tyke has at least 4 votes for dashingly dressed.  He does like to look his best.  Sorta.  In a "hey it's cool to look weird sometimes" kind of way.  What else??  Ummm...Big Poppa Booty for best buns (what a coincidence that his name has to do with his butt) simply because he has a huge ass.  Kinker for most athletic, who knows who will win that category though.  Kram better not.  But yeah, that was fun.  4th period today was quite nice.  They were working on "preparing a video" that they are gonna film this weekend when Tyke went up to ask if he could see his grade but the dumb bitch said she couldn't cuz she was working on the essay prompts for tomorrow.  Yeah, can't open two windows at once can ya?  Are you retarded?  Must be.  So then Tyke, Amed, and Dr. Phil left and went to JIB for lunch.  They left 25 minutes early so they had plennnnnty of time.  After they took their time eating Tyke suggested basketball at Tibbetts.  So there they went.  The hoops there are hella tight.  One of them is like 7 feet high which means Tyke can dunk extremely easily.  So he was doing fancy dunks and shit.  But it is extremely hard to make a really pretty dunk even on that hoop for Tyke.  He has gotten way more respect for MJ and Vince and Kobe and all the guys who can dunk well.  They have to do it on a 10' hoop too and they are only like 6 inches taller than Tyke.  But they do have much bigger hands than Tyke and big hands makes it wayyyy easier to dunk.  Tyke can't even come close to palming the ball.  He barely can do a women's one/may not actually be able to do that.  But Tyke's tight.  After school Tyke came home, changed, and went to South Cove for bball.  It was aight.  One of the guys was bitching and whining about not getting the ball so he's gay.  But nobody really likes him all that much anyway so who cares.  After he left they decided to try out the 4-square court.  Wow.  4-square is awesome.  Tyke is also very very good at it.  He was the King for the longest time total and consecutively.  Although some other players did get good at it.  Skippy is pretty dang good too.  And Maniak can be, but you can get in his head and get him rattled.  He's a fiery player.  A lot of heart.  You want him on your team.  Well, if there were teams that is.  But Tyke was the best.  DCups kinda sucked, Jew was pretty good, Ju wasn't very good, and yeah that's about it.  For dinner Tyke got to feast on Chinese food.  Mmmmmm that was good.  Very filling.  And then Tyke played ESPN which was fun.  So although this blog might not have been interesting because all he did was talk about his day without much mention of names, oh well.  That is how Tyke lives his life.  For himself.  Yeah...right.

      Hopefully you can read this, cuz Tyke has had some troubles getting it to work today.  But whatever, all that matters is that Tyke is blogging his most wonderful of days.  Today started out pretty early for Tyke as he got up at 6 to get dressed, put his suit on, and get ready for school.  It was nice to get all dressed up and when Tyke presented his speech before leaving he did it well so he was prepared to do well in class as well.  In 1st period he came back to a nice little Calc quiz, that was just some great fun.  Too bad Tyke hasn't learned shit about integrals even though his class is supposedly about Calculus but really there isn't any learning of anything other than how to draw dicks on stuff and try to hide them from the teacher (Tyke doesn't draw, he just laughs).  But after that he went to weight training where he had to change out of his suit which wasn't too bad but then he thought he was going to have to do maxes for the different lifts today but he was misinformed.  So he just talked with that junior girl for some of the period and did a little workout.  They got out of class early so Tyke was able to change back into his suit with no troubles.  Then he went to Gov for his speech.  He got many a comment through the day about how people liked his suit, his tie, or just the spiffy dressing he had done.  He was hoping for that :).  But it was fun to be in a suit all day.  And his speech went well.  He sorta didn't go PC in his speech and said "blacks" a lot and upon second realization he sorta thought he could have come off a little racist, or at least retarded, but hey, that's Tyke.  The rest of the day was pretty fun.  Walking around in the sun, talking with friends, eating pizza, just loving the moment.  In 5th period Tyke had to almost work the whole period.  But he got out for a while and ended up getting spotted by that junior girl again so they talked for a few minutes and Tyke has come to the realization that is really really nice.  She's a cool girl to hang out with and she makes the conversations fun so that's all that matters.  Unfortunately for Tyke, he didn't have his phone with him that period so he didn't get Purdy's texxxt (accidentally typed texxt first time so Tyke decided to just add one more x for fun) message about how they could hang out for a little.  But then they went to 6th period and listened to music as part of the classwork and then the day was over.  Tyke and Purdy went out to Tyke's car where MormoMan, Macaroon, Piggy J, etc had all congregated for a little talking apparently.  And all the while Tyke was half naked in the back of his car trying to get clothed.  Hmmm...is that gay?  Finally Tyke got dressed and quickly decided he was leaving so Purdy got in and they left the boys there.  Haha, good times.  Tyke got his tux today.  It's sick.  If you haven't seen the card that Tyke has, the one that gets him a discount on his tux cuz he's a rep, then Tyke will describe it for you.  But if you have seen the picture then it is just like that (and the guy in the tux looks soooooo much like Tyke).  Ok, here's how it looks.  It is a zoot suit tux and is pretty gangsta.  All white except for black vest and tie.  Black shoes with white tongues.  4 or 5 button coat that extends down to Tyke's thighs and has a chain in the pants.  Tyke still needs to get the fedora (hat) to go with it he thinks but that shouldn't be too hard.  This tux is gonna be tight.  Man, can't wait.  Just over a week away.  Sooooo excited.  Oh man, June is this next week.  Incredible.  Incredible.  Incredible.  Hardly anything left to do now.  After getting his tux, Tyke and Purdy went to Orange Julius, got really good smoothies and then went to Old Navy.  Of course they went to get flip-flops, cuz you can never have too many flip-flops as Tyke learned.  Right after Old Navy the two drove back to Purdy's to drop her off.  It wasn't that long of a trip but Tyke was stoked about getting his tux so it was very successful.  And then Tyke came home and got working.  He took about a 15 minute nap (accidental of course) and then started working on his grad portfolio cuz he failed it and all the first time.  That took a long time to do because he had to make it actually professional this time as well as the fact that he was downloading music the entire time and making a new cd.  He downloaded a lot of songs but many of the songs are for the prom cd which he hasn't burned yet.  That cd will have much slower, nighttime songs but they will still be classics.  This cd has a lot of classic rock on it.  Almost exclusively actually.  And he is listening to it now in fact.  A little Don't Fear the Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult at the moment.  I NEED MORE COWBELL!!!!  Well now Tyke is done with all of that and he saw the end of the Pistons game which was tight cuz Tayshaun Prince is tight and so is Tyke.  Really tight.  Now Tyke must bid adieu.  Adieu.

      So this weekend is now over.  And what a short but stupid one it was.  Getting back on Friday, did nothing.  First day back Saturday, did nothing.  Final day on Sunday, did speech.  Fun squared.  So today involved a lot of working.  Actually, it was a good amount of working spread out over an entire day.  But the workload was Tyke's speech.  It wasn't all that bad but it was pretty boring.  He wrote out about 15 notecards and made a boring powerpoint but that was the extent of it.  He did manage to practice like 4 times though.  And that is a lot for anyone, especially Tyke.  If that makes you think that Tyke won't be bumbling through it, you're wrong.  Although Tyke isn't a bad public speaker, his topic is stupid and really there isn't a point to it.  He just has some boring facts and oddball stuff in it.  But he does have 2 pictures that might be found funny.  Tyke was happy with his eating today though.  Some Sundays Tyke just doesn't eat any fun stuff.  But today he chowed down on some Sun Chips, Gushers, ice cream, Cheetos, Doritos, and strawberries.  Quite a healthy day.  Oh, and Tonic Water as well.  Tyke looooves Tonic Water.  Maybe he's the only one.  Well basically his day was spent doing his speech but he did also download some music.  He is starting to think of what songs he wants to put on the cd(s) that play on Prom night.  It's gonna be hard to make that a really really good cd.  Outside input will be used for sure.  Tonight was also the last Refuge.  It was fun.  Tyke is gonna miss doing that.  He has really liked the music and the messages are good.  It is also almost always funny.  And of course, he goes to it with friends.  But since he doesn't go to church his religious experience is sorta stopping for now.  But that doesn't mean it's over.  Just for now it's sorta stopping.  Damn, Tyke and Amed just sorta started talking about some prom stuff and Tyke got excited about it once again.  It is still another almost 2 weeks away though.  But it is almost here.  Phew.

      This has been a bit of a wait for all of you who are waiting to hear about Tyke's prom day experiences.  Well there is quite a bit to talk about so that is why Tyke didn't really want to blog until he was fully ready.  Now he will just let it go.  Friday, best day ever.  Tyke got up and went to Math and had no problems, then weight training and passed his power clean test, and then to government.  This was the best class of the day.  Tyke played the dad in the prom etiquette discussion in Sanders.  It was a lot of fun and really pretty hilarious.  Tyke just ad-libbed some stuff and with Dotti as his wife they made some nice sexual innuendos for the class.  Haras was Tyke's daughter and she was going out to prom with HoChyt.  All in all it was funny for sure.  After this they talked until class, and the day, was over.  Tyke and Kinker planned out the day with cars and all the prom logistical stuff.  Finally class was over though and they went to pick up their yearbooks.  Then Tyke, Amed, and Kinker drove up to Tyke's house to meet there.  Then they got directions and went up to the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Seattle to check-in for the night.  The hotel was very vast and expansive.  It was really cool.  The lobby had a little drop off where there were a bunch of meeting rooms that were pretty cool.  But it was just so big and lovely.  After checking in they went up to see their room for the night.  It was cramped they thought when they first got in there.  They looked around and thought they would have a problem having the 11 people in there because the bathroom took up much of the square footage.  But after a little bit they noticed that really it wasn't very cramped at all.  So then they decided to leave and Tyke and Kinker went out to Redmond to see if they could get Tyke his fedora but the store didn't have it so Tyke ended up not having one.  Lunch was at Wendy's for the second time this week and it was good.  (funny story, commercial for Wendy's just started on tv right after Tyke typed Wendy's here).  Kinker then drove Tyke home and Tyke's business started up again.  He had to get all of his clothes and everything together before hand just in case they were running late when Tyke got everybody else later.  Then he also had to finish making the prom mix for the car rides and that took a while.  And it was so hot out too.  Especially upstairs when Tyke was making the cd.  After that Tyke went back downstairs and decided to work out a little cuz he didn't have time to take a nap because he had to wait for his corsages to be delivered and then he had to deliver them to his friends right after.  So Tyke got the corsages and flowers and they were gorgeous.  Tyke's was a really pretty gardenia that went over so very very well with everyone who saw it, most importantly Purdy though.  Finally Tyke went down to QFC to deliver the corsages to Skippy and Tyronious.  Then he picked up Kinker after he picked up his own corsage and they went back to Tyke's to finish getting ready.  They finally got all dressed up and left to get Kinker's date up near Trewfanator's house.  She looked great and was all ready to go so they left there pretty quickly in order to pick up Tyke's date.  Tyke was like the chauffeur up until Purdy was picked up as Kinker and his date were in the back seat while Tyke was alone up front.  It was fun being the chauffeur.  But then Tyke got to Purdy's house.  She was incredible.  He went inside and said hello to her parents and made a little chit-chat (as was advised by the prom lecture earlier in the day).  Tyke showed his prom etiquette all night and everytime he would walk around to open Purdy's door and the couple gave each other points for doing what was "correct" to do.  It made the night more fun.  Sorry folks, but Tyke has to leave now because he is going to a movie tonight so he will have to finish blogging the night later on.  But you won't want to miss it.  It will be a great conclusion.  Ok, now Tyke is back.  When Tyke last left off he was discussing how he went and picked up Purdy at her house and they were just about to leave.  Purdy's parents followed Tyke and the cool car group up to Piggy J's house for pictures.  Although it was hot out, the car was nice and cool thanks to the great A/C.  The picture time at Piggy J's was pretty short because Tyke, the ringleader as he was called, made it so.  But pictures were fun.  Tyke put the corsage on Purdy and she, with the help of her mom, put on Tyke's boutineer (sp?).  Since Tyke was keeping the picture time short they took a bunch of quick pictures and started to round everyone up.  But actually pictures were fun.  Tyke finally relaxed at this point.  He was a little bit stressed and anxious for prom up until this point because he had been so busy and still had stuff to do.  They even left Tyke's house late so they didn't get to pictures exactly when he wanted to get there.  But it turned out fine.  Tyke really was enjoying himself already and the night had hardly even begun at this point.  He was definitely excited to be going with Purdy.  Traffic wasn't all that bad for getting to the Edgewater Hotel.  Tyke ended up following Maniak and they got there without any snags at all.  A really easy drive.  Especially nice because of Tyke's prom mix that he ended up being pretty pleased with.  He wasn't able to give it the focus he really wanted to but he made it pretty good because there were quite a few songs that everyone in the car was singing to.  Or, at least half of the car was singing to.  Dinner was outstanding.  The hotel had a lovely restaurant and since the group had 18 people in it, they got their own room which made it even better.  The hotel is right on the water and they have a little ledge that you can go out onto so it was terrific to be able to have the doors open, look out over the blue water as boats passed by and then even see the reflection of the sun as it began to set in the west.  This was probably the second best part of the night.  Actually yeah, it was.  After dinner came the dance.  This was the best part of the night.  The directions apparently gave some people some problems in getting there but it really wasn't that hard.  In fact, the directions were correct.  But some people read the wrong ones or didn't know which way to turn out of the hotel, but that wasn't their fault.  When the group got to the dance they first did pictures.  That took a little while but it wasn't bad.  Tyke and Purdy hopefully have some good shots together.  The group pictures weren't able to be done right away because Dr. Phil's car got lost so the rest of the group waited a little bit for them to get to the dance.  But they finally did and it was cool.  The group was supposed to show as much teeth as possible but in the end, it will be shown who did what and who didn't do what.  Once pictures were done came the best part of the night.  The dancing.  Tina came over with Tyke and Purdy to the dance floor and they started to get their groove on.  Let's just say these three were the three hottest dancers on the floor.  No doubt about it.  Tyke basically got to have 2 dates for a little bit because Tina's date isn't as cool as Tyke is.  The first slow song was pretty good you could say.  Tyke, Purdy, and Tina joined together for a nice 3-way dance.  Yeah, that was something that Tyke enjoyed just a little.  Just a little.  Screw that, it was awesome!!  Totally unexpected too.  Who woulda thought that would happen to Tyke?  But it was fun to dance with two of Tyke's closest girl friends.  Tina ended up leaving not all that much longer after that so Tyke then had the one date.  But he lost nothing by having Tina leave.  He just gained the best prom date ever.  Purdy and Tyke had some good dances.  For the slow dances Tyke got the good idea to have Purdy dance on Tyke's feet because the height difference apparently wasn't real conducive to the best dancing.  Dancing was fun.  A lot of fun.  But eventually the dance came to an end and after Tyke got all of the cameras and all of his stuff they left the dance for the hotel.  Purdy was actually not sleepy when they left, in fact she got kinda hyper.  This is not something that usually happens when Tyke and Purdy leave a place at night.  Don't worry though, it didn't last all that long.  Everyone who was staying at the hotel went back right away so they ended up not doing any activity beforehand.  But everybody was pretty tired so it wasn't a big deal.  They got to the hotel about midnight and then went up and unpacked a little and got cozy.  Although it seemed cramped at first (like Tyke knew it would), it turned out fine for the 11 mates.  At one point HoChyt came over with his girl and Blume came too.  So they had 14 people at once and it still didn't seem super crowded.  There were a few girls next door who were kinda weird so Tyke went outside their room and started flexing and doing the usual Tyke stuff.  Then they followed him back as he went back to his room and they came back with some drinks, but Tyke told them it was a dry party so they quickly went back to their room after hearing that.  Yeah, the hotel was fun.  But it was the least fun of the three activities.  And it still was better than Tyke's house which is all that he really cares about.  Most everyone slept on the floor and they all had enough room.  Everyone said that the floor was uncomfortable but after sleeping on the floor in Ashland, this floor was heavenly.  It wasn't like a bed but it didn't hurt just to lay on it like it did in Ashland.  But if the hotel was like the one in Ashland then it wouldn't have been worth the stay.  The gang did end up sleeping.  They probably fell asleep around 3:30-4 AM which wasn't too bad.  Then they got up at 9ish.  Although Tyke stayed on the ground trying to fall asleep he was awake basically from 9 to when they checked out.  They checked out at 11 and Tyke drove home Purdy and Kinker's date as Kinker had a game at 10 so he left the hotel earlier on.  Tyke and Kinker's date, who were already acquaintances (maybe not so much friends but still talked to each other), had some good talks throughout the night and morning.  Tyke, upon dropping off Purdy at her house, had one last chance to go around the front of the car and open her door and then he took her stuff in to say goodbye and thanks for the best night of his life so far.  It was just so much fun and she was such an unbelievably great date.  Tyke was very lucky to be able to go to the most special (and hyped) dance of school with such a remarkable girl.  He is truly blessed.  But after Tyke took home Purdy he went up to take home Kinker's date and then hugged her goodbye before finally heading home to his own house.  He unloaded the car, took all his stuff out, put his tux together, and did all of the stuff he had to do.  Then he talked to his parents about the night and then he got ready to go pick up his car at the service place and then drop off his tux.  His car is actually looking alright now.  The body shop place looked to see if they could figure out what caused his accident but they don't have an answer yet.  But they did hammer out some of the dent in the hood and popped the grill back in so really the cosmetic damage isn't that noticeable.  It might not even need any real work done on it now.  And the shop didn't even ask for any payment but Tyke's dad insisted.  After dropping off his tux, and getting the discount he didn't get last time, he went home and took a 3 hour nap (he set his alarm to wake up for dinner).  Then he ate dinner and started blogging what he finished earlier.  Then he got called by Amed to go to a movie with him, Dr. Phil, Macaroon, and K-Caj.  They saw Day After Tomorrow which isn't a bad movie but it's just so unbelievable that you have to laugh about it.  And by mere coincidence they sat right in front of Skippy and Samantha.  Then the guys (not Skippy) went back to Tyke's house where they watched some TV, read some of the yearbook, played poker, and then played Risk.  Tyke was proud of himself for being able to hold all of Asia for one turn and thus getting the continental bonus of 7.  He only managed to hold it for one turn which is why he didn't dominate the game but he still was very happy to be able to do that once.  But K-Caj ended up being like Napoleon and fortifying himself on the "island" of Europe and getting that bonus every turn.  Then he just spanned out from there and with the help of the other 4 guys killing each other, took over the world almost entirely.  But he met his Waterloo in Asia and wasn't able to take out all of Tyke.  Then he had every single country but 5 (Australian continent and Siam-Tyke owned).  But if the game had continued he almost definitely would have lost to Dr. Phil's massive army.  But maybe not.  It is hard to say for sure.  But yeah, it is quite late and Tyke needs to sleep.  So thanks for being patient and sorry for Tyke not mentioning everyone's name for the prom night but it is hard to be so thoughtful all the time.  Forgive him.  Love.

      Although there is probably going to be more to blog about tonight Tyke decided he might as well just blog now and if there is something he is dying to talk about later he will just post again.  Today was of course the Senior Presentations.  So they only had 3 periods today, 4th, 5th, and 6th.  In 4th period Tyke, Amed, and Dr. Phil showed their english video and it went over pretty well.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  And nobody noticed the fuck ups where Tyke said Laertes instead of Claudius because in the miracle that is editing, the guys just turned the sound to mute basically for that short part so that you can't hear Tyke say any name.  It was very smart of them.  And the rest of the period was spent being idle.  Then in 5th period Tyke worked with Macaroon on the final for physics.  The scavenger hunt is pretty hard.  It's gonna take a while to do and they only have a week to do it in.  But Tyke has worked on it already and he has about 10 answers so far.  And also he will be able to just copy off smart people so that works out pretty well.  After 5th period Tyke actually went to physics and got a few more answers done before heading off.  "The Executives" (named such because of their very business-like dress for their speeches) went out to Schlotzky's Deli for lunch.  The gang was Tyke (driving), Dr. Phil, Amed, Macaroon, and K-Caj.  They got behind a bus as they were driving and man did this ever fuck Tyke over.  Hardcore.  Like, this mistake cost Tyke a few thousand dollars.  Here's why...The bus was letting every other bus driver go out of the school and thus holding up traffic and making everyone behind them wait.  This is unacceptable.  Fuck that person.  Tyke was driving along and got onto Newport Way.  It turned out that Pauly was in front of him, and actually this saved Tyke a lot of trouble.  As they were driving the car in front of Pauly stopped very suddenly to turn left off the road thus making Pauly slam on his brakes to avoid hitting her.  He managed to stop but Tyke still had to do the same.  Tyke slammed on his brakes and started to slow down when his brakes went soft and pushed straight to the floor without giving any resistance and not acting like brakes should, to stop the car.  Tyke went slamming into the back of Pauly's SUV and Tyke was like, "ummm...shit."  Tyke wasn't really speeding very much as there was a lot of traffic so he couldn't but he was following too closely.  But his brakes flat out failed him and when Blume got out of the car to look at Tyke's car he goes "Ohhhh shiiiiiit..."  At first Tyke thought he was joking but then he got out and Tyke's hood was popped in, the grill was bent and sticking out, one of the headlights was bent a little and it just looked like a bit of a mangled mess.  Without really thinking they went to the place where the bitch lady turned in but there wasn't anything they could do.  And the most miraculous thing about this was that Pauly's car had absolutely no damage at all.  There is the spare tire on the back of the truck that managed to save his car.  Tyke couldn't even tell where he got hit because it was so un-damaged.  Everything worked fine so it was only Tyke's car that got damaged.  In reality that is a very good thing as Tyke only has to worry about the damage to his own car.  When he got to Schlotzky's he left a nice little message for his mom telling her what happened.  Then he ate and drove back to school for the presentation.  The actual presentation went fine.  Tyke was easily in the time limits and had no real struggles during the speech.  He got grilled by one lady and she kept asking stupid questions but he answered with ease.  That was simple.  Then he had to wait around for a long time as he was the second to go in the room.  He was glad he went early though.  It is way better to get it over with and have nothing to do than to have to wait through everything.  After that was over Tyke went outside and ripped off his clothes and then called his mom again.  She said she was pretty busy and didn't have time to talk so he was a little bit short with Tyke but he later found out she was actually pissed at Tyke.  But that got resolved as he will explain later.  Tyke then had to drive his car home and leave it there of course while Macaroon came over to pick him up and drive him around.  They went and got gas and then Tyke withdrew some money from the ATM before heading to Macaroon's to change and then to play some bball/frisbee.  They played there for a while and were joined by Dr. Phil, Fejj, K-Caj, and Maniak.  Then they left to pick up their tuxes.  Tyke's is tight.  All white...wait Tyke already explained its appearance.  But yeah it looks cool.  Tyke wasn't able to rent the hat that he wants to so he thinks he will go out to Redmond to try to get it there but it isn't a dire necessity for the outfit.  It would just look cool.  But anyways Macaroon drove Tyke home and then he talked about prom and his car.  His mom said that she was pissed cuz when Tyke said his brakes failed she thought he was just covering himself but when she checked it out she realized that Tyke was actually not lying, this time.  So basically, although Tyke was following too closely, he was not 100% at fault here.  Which made Tyke feel a little better but he is still guilty about the trouble he has caused.  But basically Tyke isn't in any trouble or anything and really his punishment is that tomorrow he has to drive the Avalon all day.  Haha, damn.  But yeah, that is taken care of.  And now Tyke has to wait for his dad to call so that they can go take Tyke's car to the shop tonight and leave it there.  Then they can have it get the brakes fixed to start with.  The hood still sorta doesn't open but eh, whatev.  So yeah, today has been pretty interesting.  Of course June is gonna be nice and full of crazy stuff like this.  Let's hope Tyke doesn't break his leg while he is walking for graduation.  That sounds like something that could happen if this pace is continued.  Tomorrow though is supposed to be fun.  Tyke will be pretty damn busy though.  But that is a good thing hopefully.  It will keep him having fun at least.  It's too bad that he can't sleep in tomorrow though.  Oh well, sleep can wait.  But now Tyke can't wait.

      How come the days keep being so complicated now?  Man, this is getting crazy and hectic and just weirdddd.  So Tyke should probably talk about his day now seeing as that is what this blog is.  Well today Tyke had to get up early of course cuz he was going to go make up days for weight training.  He got a little over 7 hours of sleep cuz he had the concert and all last night but Tyke is someone who needs about 11 hours to really feel good.  Even though he is still tired then.  Hmmm...whatever.  But today there was no make-up days for weight training so Tyke and Macaroon were left out with nothing to do.  So Tyke drove them to Krispy Kreme/Farget and they ate and listened to music.  But Tyke has been listening to his Val Emmich CD all day.  He really likes it.  The tunes are stuck in his head.  In a good way though.  Ok...back to the day.  Tyke and Macaroon came back to school and then the day began.  It was a easy day with it being Wednesday and all.  But in weight training Tyke didn't get to go out and play because he is smart and everyone else is stupid so he had to help people figure out the math for what their goals are for their maxes.  At lunch Amed and Dr. Phil joined Tyke at Mickey D's for some good McFlurrys and then it was off to the rest of the day.  Tyke finished a project for the first time in like a month in Graphics (he started it yesterday as well) and then he went out to roam like usual.  The junior girl (who was "sad she couldn't talk to him much in weight training") was out so she talked with Tyke for a little.  She's pretty cool.  Annnnyway the rest of the day went by fine.  After school was the time to pick up cap and gowns for seniors and that was a pretty long line.  But Tyke passed the time with Kinker and Macaroon and Triple Threat and then Tina joined in too.  After picking up the stuff Tyke and Tina went to the counseling office to pick up some stuff for her and then they walked and talked for a little about some stuff but nothing too long.  Then Tyke went home.  And he did laundry, prepared his speech, and found out some news about prom.  Since another person can't go to the hotel after the dance Tyke and Amed starting thinking about what to do.  It was stressful and annoying but they finally just dropped the second room they are getting and now it is one room for the group.  Macaroon helped out some in the decision but again Tyke and Amed made the decision by brute force.  That took a little while and pushed Tyke's practice time back too.  Cuz he had to help his mom out with stuff.  And he also put his cap and gown on and damn that looks pretty cool.  It looked like he was about to graduate or something.  But yeah Tyke practiced his speech for his mother, cuz she made him, and boy was it bad.  He told his mom that he was more nervous about doing it for her alone than he was for doing it for the panel.  She just kept looking at Tyke and she was like 2 feet away.  It was freaky.  So it was the worst and fastest he's done it ever and it was still over 9 minutes so he's fine.  It's gonna be easy.  But then Tyke spent about 20 minutes deciding which tie to wear with his suit.  He is now wearing a red, or power, tie with the blue shirt and black suit.  He's ever-so-handsome.  But then came the time when he had to take it off and blog.  So he did so.  Tomorrow Tyke gets to show his video for English and also do his presentation.  Then he is picking up his tux at 4 and if he can't get the fedora there he is gonna go to Northwest Costume in Redmond to get the hat there.  Yep, good times.  All's well now.  All is well.  Let's go.

      Tyke's ears are ringing.  Both of them.  It sounds weird.  Well today was interesting for Tyke.  He found out that the final he was going to have in math on senior skip day is now moved so he doesn't have to come that day and that is a good thing.  Definitely a good thing.  And he does still have to make up days for weight training tomorrow which is too bad.  In Gov they just continued to watch Not Without My Daughter and then in english sucky stuff happened.  Tyke, Dr. Phil, and Amed skipped after a few minutes into class and went to Wendy's for lunch.  Upon returning they found out that that fucking teacher took attendance at the end of class so of course they got marked absent.  The worst part of it all is that the school ended up calling Tyke's house about it after Tyke left at night for the concert so his mom came down (at 11:40 when he got home) to talk to him about it.  Tyke played it off saying that he didn't know anything about it and that it is wrong but she is not liking what's happening.  This is really getting to annoy Tyke.  Sure, it was his fault for skipping but that stupid english class and school in general is really pissing Tyke off.  It doesn't help that Tyke is not in a good mood now anyway but this is just freaking pathetic.  Tyke is really disgruntled and angry.  He started off just being in a quiet mood but that has turned to anger.  And he doesn't know exactly what he can do about it either so that is tough.  Back to earlier on though.  After school Tyke downloaded a few songs for the prom mix and just sat around until 5 basically.  That's when he left for Dotti's to meet up with Purdy and Ekul for the Dashboard Confessional concert.  Purdy drove and they got there really easily by getting off at that one exit (whatever it is called).  There was a really long line of people that made Tyke think that they would have to wait for a while but it turned out good.  Tyke and Dotti had to buy their tickets at the theater but they ended up getting floor seats for cheaper than Purdy's so it turned out well.  And then they cut in the lines to get in quickly.  And then they just sat and waited.  Oh yeah, Tyke wore the pink shirt today and got the usual comments, along with some new ones.  But that's beside the point, whatever the point was to begin with.  Well the concert was good.  Val Emmich (yeah, thats who it was...) was good and Tyke got a sample of their "shits" and that was cool.  Then was The Get-Up Kids and Tyke didn't like them.  Then came Thrice who had 2 songs that Tyke knew he liked but yeah, he didn't end up liking them.  They played hardcore stuff and everybody was just moshing and shit and Tyke really wasn't into it so he just pushed people back if they got in his grill.  He was able to hold his own when he was like 8 rows back from the stage.  But Stare at the Sun was played and that is Tyke's favorite song of theirs, as well as Dotti's.  And then was DC.  They were good and they played for quite a while.  And the lead singer (really the whole band) gave some nice speeches about wearing a condom, voting, and just fun stuff.  He is a really cool guy.  He even stopped the music at one point cuz he noticed quite a few people were passing out or getting exhausted or whatever.  So that was really good of him.  It earned him more points.  Well then the concert was over and they came home.  And then Tyke's mom got to him and then he came downstairs and now he is a little bit less annoyed but he still isn't happy.  It's just too painful to deal with.  It makes him want to cry.

      Monday Monday, bah bah, bah bah bah.  The Mamas and the Papas.  Tykey woke up at 10 and had what turned out to be a full day in front of him.  He ate breakfast and played a little MVP but then got a game of basketball going up at Cougar Ridge.  Tyke joined up with Maniak, Amed, Tyronious, and Macaroon for some bball and actually some 4-square as well.  But Tyke dominated the basketball games.  He won the 21 games, him and Maniak won the 2 v 3 game, and Tyke won every game but one of bump.  Then at 4-square he did pretty well but it hurt his wrist to hit the ball so much so he retired quickly and went back to shooting around.  Then he and Amed retired to the Russian dwelling to edit the English masterpiece they filmed at Tyke's house on Saturday.  The editing involved a lot of yelling with Amed and his dad, some moments where nothing was going right, and just a lot of tries to get it right.  But really it went pretty smoothly.  The funny thing for Tyke is that he knew some of how to use this software because of his work at KING5 and all of the time he has spent there.  The stuff Amed has is a downsized version of what is used at the station so Tyke had a little hands-on experience with it already.  And thus he was able to do some stuff pretty well.  It was a lot of fun to do and they made the video innumerably times better than it already was.  It was just adequate before, not even all that funny, but now it rocks.  Just sickness.  And it isn't even due until June 10th.  But you should be dying in anticipation to see this.  And now that Tyke has built it up way more than he should have, it will suck.  But that doesn't matter.  Making movies will now be much easier to do.  Especially once Tyke gets his software too.  After editing Tyke met up with his parents in Factoria for dinner at Applebee's.  It was nice and tasty.  And after that they went to Tyke's mom's work to drop off Tyke's brother's car for he is getting back from San Fran (at least that's where Tyke thinks he's at) where he was at a friend's wedding.  Tyke loves driving his bro's mobile.  It is fast, has tinted windows, a sub, good speakers, and is much more comfy than Tyke's car.  Tyke even likes the smell of it.  But now he is back to driving his own car and he has to fill it up tomorrow which means dropping like 25 bucks.  Of his parents' money that is.  Once Tyke got online he was reminded that he is going to a concert tomorrow.  Dashboard Confessional, that's gonna be good.  Of course with Dotti and Purdy.  Tyke was going to go to the Mariners on Wednesday but he sacrificed that in order to go to the concert.  His mom keeps pressuring him about homework and such so he had to play it safe.  It will all work out in the end.  And this week is just going to be so much fun.  School, concert, running, school, speech, school, speech, school, yearbooks, check-in at hotel, prom, laser show, hotel.  Damn, so much to look forward to this week.  Let's just hope it doesn't get too crazy.  Yikes!  This is gonna be cwazay!

      Sunday was cool.  One of the last Sundays he has of high school.  But because of Memorial Day, Tyke doesn't have to go to school tomorrow.  Henceforth, Tyke got up at noon today and played MVP for most of the day.  Like a very big portion of the day in fact.  He also watched some TV and listened to music but up until dinner he didn't even go out of the house.  At dinner though he went with his parents to La Casita for some Mexican food.  It was decent but not all that great.  But before Tyke left for dinner he remembered about the state baseball games.  He saw the score and detail for the first game where Swat threw a complete game 2-hitter and Issaquah won 6-0.  Then he tried to find the radio station that the Everett games would have been broadcast on but it turned out that the championship wasn't on there.  So Tyke had to wait until the scores were updated online.  Macaroon came over tonight.  Just the two of them.  They played MVP solely.  They did the Batter and Pitcher Showdowns which are pretty fun for a while.  But then they get kinda boring.  So they ended up stopping at 11ish.  Tyke had checked the score online and found out that Issaquah won 8-2 and are now 3A State Champions for baseball.  That's just tight.  Kinker called Tyke at 10ish but Tyke had already found out by that point.  Too bad Tyke wasn't still playing baseball but that's ok.  It was his decision anyway, although back problems did play into that.  But now it's just nice to be at the school that is champs.  And hopefully WSU can pull some of that same magic next year.  Or maybe UW can do well this year too.  Selection show is at 9AM tomorrow for the College World Series.  The CWS is fun to watch.  College baseball is fun to watch.  Especially if you know people playing.  Kinda like how John Olerud is cooler cuz of Tyke's connection, and Randy Johnson, and Curtis Borchardt.  All of these people either Tyke knows or a close friend of Tyke's knows.  Jim Beattie can be thrown in as wel but most of you probably don't have any idea who that is anyway.  Except for Kinker but Tyke knows Jim mostly through Kinker anyway.  Whatever, it's all relative.  Yeah, that meant nothing.  And now Tyke sleeps.  Sleep.

      Saturday was not at all like any day Tyke has had for quite some time.  It just wasn't normal.  Tyke was awakened by his mother at like 8:45 or 9:45 to ask him what time his haircut was.  Then she just left and Tyke went back to sleep.  At 11 he got his haircut for the last time before Europe and then he came back home.  He did some cleaning up of his downstairs (just a little) and talked with his mom about the trip coming up.  Then his brother and dad came home and they all talked about the trip.  Tyke made himself some split pea soup but he really hates the pull-off cans that soup comes in now.  They are such a bitch for Tyke to open.  He always opens it too strongly and spills on himself.  It's so annoying.  So he just had his dad do it today.  Lazy?  Yes.  Later on Tyke's bro decided he was going to go to REI in Redmond and Tyke decided to tag along.  Tyke got some cool boxers/boxer briefs that are like partially spandex and nylon and they are stretchy and sooooo comfortable but most importantly they are quick dry so he can wear them for Europe and just wash one pair at night and have it dry in the morning easily.  So that makes his packing a little bit easier.  He also got a stretchy fleece that is also soooo comfortable and really quite warm too.  He will probably take that with him to Europe but it will also come in handy during the cold days and nights at WSU.  College, damn that's soon.  It's so weird.  DCups was working at REI today so Tyke and him chatted for a little bit but then Tyke got his stuff and went to Borders where he got Muse's Absolution CD.  It's really good.  Tyke really likes almost every song on there.  They are an interesting sound.  Really good though, really good.  Tyke's bro got the Franz Ferdinand CD so when Tyke got home he burned a copy of that and Modest Mouse for himself and then burned Muse for his bro.  Haha, gotta love technology.  Then Tyke put on his new boxers and found out how incredibly comfy they really are.  Then he (oh yeah he was wearing the pink shirt all day) ate some food and listened to Absolution with his bro while watching TV.  At about 7:45 his cousin's and aunt and uncle (dad's side) came over.  A little graduation celebration and Europe trip send-off of sorts.  And just a chance to hang out with Tyke's older cousin who lives in New York (she could be teaching the Olsen twins next year by the way).  It was fun to talk with them and also he got $200 from them, bringing his total for the day up to $330, including the $30 the tux shop never paid him for being a rep.  So now he has made like 380 bucks for graduating.  Not bad for only getting like 4 cards.  Basically, prom spending has been nullified and then some.  After they left Tyke signed Tina's yearbook and it was sad to do.  It's starting to get sad for Tyke.  His Europe trip is going to be fun but he is going to miss seeing the girls (ok...and the guys too).  But after the party on Monday he will never see some of those people again.  The ones he really wants to see he will be able to hang out with but not nearly on the same scale.  And he really hopes to be able to hang out with friends a lot when he is here during the summer.  He really hopes so.  He fears not being able to, that is how much he wants to hang out.  Now Tyke is listening to Absolution and calming himself to the point where everything is moving in slow motion.  He is even blinking half speed.  This...is...

      Today was it.  The last day of high school (thanks Hun for your ever-so-kind post) is already gone.  Tyke had his one final today in math to start off the day.  He didn't think it was as bad as it could have been but he still probably didn't get what he needed in order to keep his grade static but at least it wasn't that hard to actually do.  Tyke either knew how to do the problem or had no idea so he could just skip it or make up an answer.  He finished his test pretty quickly so he still had time to go pick up his graduation tickets and get his english teacher to sign off the sheet saying he would pass (ha, Tyke finds it funny he has to do that).  But then once his 1st period was over he went to weight training to finish off his high school career.  He did his bench rep test today and tried his dots but wasn't even close so he knew there wasn't a chance of him passing that.  He talked to Nene some and sorta said goodbye for a while as they most likely won't see each other for a long time.  Even though they haven't known each other that long, they've become pretty good friends.  After weight training though...it was over.  Tyke went to the commons to meet up with his row for graduation but that was it.  They got together, all 11 of them, and then they got seated.  The senior hall of fame and the I

      Tyke just realized that.  This is the last blog Tyke does with school the next day.  Or at least high school.  He'll still be doing blogs in college he thinks.  So don't worry about that.  But still, this is something of a finale.  The blog has pretty much been a staple of Tyke's senior year in high school.  He started it in the end of October and now he has kept it going all the way to June.  218 blogs.  218...that's just great.  Tyke is proud of himself for his dedication seeing as he hasn't been able to dedicate himself to keep anything going this long.  This is pretty remarkable for him.  Today was not all that remarkable but fun nonetheless.  Nothing went on in math today.  In weight training Tyke tried to do his bench rep test but on his 8th rep he just hit the wall and was about half a rep shy of getting it.  So he'll have to try it tomorrow.  Tyke also talked with Nene (junior girl) and finished signing each other's yearbooks.  In 3rd period since they have no final they just signed yearbooks and talked.  Tyke started up a little Clark Sharks page in his book.  Yeah, the Clark Sharks ruled the water.  Especially cuz if any other elementary school tried to come attack Clark they would have to do it underwater so they would all drown.  Haha, Tyke is now reading back over some of his blogs and he is loving it.  He just found one post from February where he was talking about Chinko.  Remember that game??  It didn't catch on like he said it would.  Oh well, you can't be right all the time, but most of the time he is.  You know what though, it's a blast to go back and read his old blogs.  He is reading some good stuff right now.  He had a nice writing style back in the day.  Maybe he still does, but he likes how his blogs used to flow.  Tina's mom just called, but not for Tyke.  Yeah, back to school though.  4th period they watched more videos.  One group's was so dirty.  It was just shocking really.  But still funny and one of the best Tyke and Dr. Phil thought.  After class Tyke, Dr. Phil, and Amed decided that they wanted to go to Mongolian Grill and they did.  Some other people tagged along as well.  Damn that's good.  It was very tasty.  After that the gang went back to Tyke's and they were joined by Kinker.  They played some Shithead and then started up Risk when Big Twigg came over too.  So they started a game and got very close to finishing it (after Dr. Phil raped Tyke in Asia, perhaps stopping Tyke from winning, but it's all good in war) but MormoMan and Skramfejj came over as well.  When Kinker had to leave (after taking over much of the world) MormoMan took over and finished the job.  Then they played a few more Risk games.  They did the Capitals version which is way different.  Tyke will teach you that version later.  There were some hilarious moments when everyone picked their capital right next to each other.  But all in all Risk is one hell of an awesome game.  It is just so great.  Especially the beginning of the games.  That is Tyke's favorite part.  At 5 Tyke kicked everyone out cuz his mom has been getting on his case about studying for his 1 final.  Well he still didn't study at all but oh well.  He did eat chips and Gushers for dinner so there!  Tyke is gonna wrap it up now.  It is time to move on to another chapter.  Wow, so close.

      Tyke doesn't feel like blogging.  A long, tiring day.  Woke up nice and late and then didn't do anything 1st period other than the test.  Then 2nd period he signed yearbooks with junior girl and other people.  Then came a brief stop in 3rd period where there was a little bit more yearbook signing.  But then came the Senior Assembly.  It wasn't sad this year.  There was still crying but really, it wasn't that sad.  It was still good but not sad.  A couple of bands played and they were alright.  Tank did his rendition of I Believe in a Thing Called Love which was good but Last Dance with Mary Jane wasn't spectacular.  The slide show was fine but it is cool to know that it is really a culmination of it all.  Tyke didn't have any pictures of him for a while, then he had a few, and then BOOM!  He just owned the prom portion of it.  There was like 40 pictures of him there.  One of them was the photo of Tyke slow dancing with Purdy where it looks like he is leaning in for a kiss or something.  It was funny.  Afterwards some of the girls were crying but not all that many.  But Tyke still comforted his lady friends ;-).  Smileys rule by the way.  After leaving school Tyke went to Schlotzky's with the gang.  Once again Tyke got complimented on his pink shirt, this time by the asian girl working the cash register.  She said she liked it, Tyke thanked her, then she started giggling until Tyke left to get his food.  It was cool.  If Tyke had a nickel for every time he got a compliment on his pink shirt, he'd have at least 50 cents.  That is a solid bet in the poker games so he'd take it.  Anybody wanna give him a nickel every time you comment on the shirt?  After lunch the crew went back to Tyke's to play Cranium.  Tyke and Dr. Phil dominated.  Tyke got every single Word Worm question right.  The Gnilleps and all the other spelling ones were owned by Tyke.  He excels at that kind of stuff anyway though.  Everyone left to play basketball at Amed's at 2 and that was crazy.  There were 10 people there to start and Kinker was playing and he went balls out.  He ended up cutting up Tyke with his thumb somehow.  There is a clean rip of skin from Tyke's left arm.  It looks like a hickey that drew blood.  It's Tyke (like tight but with Tyke's name).  But basketball was fun and Tyke didn't get tired.  Later on Tyke went home and ate dinner.  Then at 7 some of the gang came over and played poker.  Tyke ended up losing 10 but he played ok.  He just got rivered a couple of times.  It was fine though.  Now the night is over but tomorrow is an easy day.  Easy easy.  Bye now.

      Yep, the last full day of high school.  That is quite an accomplishment.  12 years of schooling in the marvelous Issaquah School District are culminating right now.  3 more days of school.  Damn the Lakers.  Damn Roger Clemens.  Pistons are still in the driver's seat though.  And the Mariners aren't good anyway so it was a surprise to see the score 1-0 as the Rocket left.  And Hiram Bocachica earned a few points in Tyke's book for taking out the second basemen on a possible DP.  That shows some good smarts and smart, hard baseball.  Just like it should be played.  If you didn't see the AB with Ichiro, it was very enjoyable.  But that isn't all that was enjoyable about today.  As was aforementioned, today was the last full day and the first day of "finals."  Tyke started a group test today in math and finishes it tomorrow.  Then in weight training Tyke passed his squat test.  It was pretty easy.  And then came 3rd and 4th periods.  Nothing went down then.  Just yearbook signing and some movie watching was it.  Then came the last lunch at school ever.  Not literally at school, but just the last lunch period.  They went to Pie because it was pretty fitting.  And it was a free lunch for Tyke so that's good too.  Then came 5th and 6th period finals.  In 5th period Tyke had quite a bit of work to do on projects.  Man, his work was laughable.  He turned in 3 projects (plus his entire folder just cuz he wanted to) today but they were so shoddy.  He was supposed to paint one thing but instead he used Crayola markers and he free handed some drawings that need rulers.  It was just classic last minute Tyke work.  Something to be proud of really.  Cuz 5 points (out of a 50 point assignment) is better than no points.  And that is the truth.  6th period was even easier than 5th.  Just working on the scavenger hunt.  And Tyke spent most of his time just copying down the answers that were on the poster.  He has like 11 answers left.  64 done.  So he already has like a C on it probably.  That's the best he's done on anything in there for a while.  Then the class just sat around and tried to get 1/2 to do his little bet with a student right then but he said he was gonna do it at the softball game after school.  After school, Tyke and Skippy played in the Senior v. Staff softball game.  It was fun.  There were like 20 some players for seniors though which meant that they had to split up into two halves and then the girls got to play the whole time (which can get a little gay just cuz sometimes they don't even want to play so why force them and then not let guys who want to play get the opportunity).  But Tyke made a few nice plays.  Oww, Bocachica just made a great diving catch but his wrist totally got bent backwards.  It looked somewhat painful.  But the softball game was fun and it was hot.  Then Tyke came home and had the house to himself for a while cuz his parents were busy til later.  But his dad brought home dinner and then Tyke went to meet his mom in Issaquah to do some shopping for some videocamera supplies and other stuff for the Europe trip (which is a freaking week away from tomorrow!!!).  Tyke has to pack within a couple of days.  That's going to be so weird.  Especially cuz it will be for so long.  Well now the night is over.  Tyke's eyes still feel a little weird.  He woke up this morning and couldn't see out of his left eye and then it started to fade but he still had a spot where he just couldn't see cuz it was blurred.  And both of his eyes were dry and itchy and pretty red.  The redness has improved but they still are dry.  Let's hope that goes away tonight.  Oh yeah, Tyke got prom pictures today.  He has a nice awkward smile in the pose that was used for most of the pictures.  The black and white ones were way better Tyke thought.  He actually had a decent smile there but nooooo, they had to use the other one.  Oh well, it isn't that big of a deal.  Next...

      Funny how Your Song is playing right as Tyke begins to blog for tonight.  The lyrics start off pretty well for relating to Tyke.  Hence the great title of this first post in which Tyke actually uses titles.  So today was a day off for Tyke.  Just cuz he is a senior.  But really it seems like there were quite a few seniors who didn't skip today.  Maybe it was a normal amount though.  Tyke wasn't a senior other years so he can't tell ya.  Maybe if he doesn't graduate he can tell you next year.  But don't hold your breath, cuz holding your breath for a year is a long time.  You'd most likely die.  But in the rare chance you didn't die, you'd most likely come to find out that Tyke graduated so you were holding your breath for no reason anyway.  So here's how today went for all of you Tyke-heads out there.  Tyke got up at 10 and planned a poker game with Kinker for 11 at Tyke's house.  Kinker, Dr. Phil, DCups, Skippy, and Macaroon came.  Skippy came for only a little but he still left with a few bucks.  Tyke ended up losing 15 but then got a one dollar bonus for using his house and such.  So he only lost 14 in the end.  Once everyone left Tyke went to Dotti's house for some lunch and they planned to see Harry Potter.  However, not many people ended up coming apparently so they just went to lunch.  Purdy, Karla, Dudely Doo, Big Poppa Booty were all there.  They had some good Red Robin chow and stayed there for a while.  Then everyone dissipated and Tyke and Dotti went and rented a movie before going back to Dotti's and splitting there.  Tyke came back home and was just kinda like, damn.  Mainly cuz he wanted to hang out with the girls for longer but then he knew his parents wouldn't be too keen on him hanging out with them later at night like he could have so he ended up not doing anything really for the rest of the day.  He did re-burn some of his lost mixes and he wrote a nice note as well.  That was something he just needed to do.  He just needed to get some things out and since he has been struggling with writing songs for a while he just wrote them in words in a personal manner.  Then he listened to some good music, mellow music that is, and played some ESPN.  And now he is listening to American Pie while the M's play in the background with mute on.  And "this'll be the day that I die..."

      Blogging, again.  Like always.  Every night.  It's quite commonplace.  Today was very slow too.  Tyke woke up at 12:40 and didn't get out of bed til after 1.  Then he didn't do anything all day.  He played some video games, watched some tv, and just took it easy.  Really he did nothing.  He talked a little bit online but that was pretty much all.  So he had a very slow day after a string of really busy days, or just tiresome days.  He did have that feeling of missing the fact that prom was over.  It was just so much fun.  And now Tyke graduates in a week (whoa, one week from today Tyke graduates high school) and he leaves for Europe in just over a week meaning he will not get to see anyone for a long time.  Then he gets back on the 5th and has his wisdom teeth out on the 9th.  So he is a busy little boy.  But it will all be fun.  Damn, Tyke feels a little hot right now.  Hopefully it doesn't mean anything.  Tonight Dr. Phil, Kinker, and Macaroon came over to Tyke's house.  They played a spirited game of Risk.  Tyke probably should have won.  He made a few miscues, like allowing for Kinker to take out Dr. Phil and thus get his cards which meant that Tyke lost his upper hand.  And then he just got pwned on some rolls which hurt him later on.  The cards also weren't in his favor as he had 5 of the same card and 2 of another so instead of having two sets, he only had the one and couldn't turn in 2 sets of cards at once, thus getting a humongous bonus.  But in the end Kinker played it well and won.  Then they played MOH and hosed some Bromley's and then finally finished the night off with ESPN.  Trenton Hassell and Luke Walton are better than Allen Iverson and Chris Webber.  That was proven.  And Luke Walton is better than Shaq too.  Just so that you know.  Tomorrow Tyke gets to go see Harry Potter and hang out which will be fun.  Hopefully he has his car though as they might be taking it in to get an appraisal.  But that will come later.  Now Tyke's bed is calling.

      And so this is it.  Tyke's last night (and really it is Wednesday now so he has already had his last night) in the good old U.S.A.  Tyke is excited for leaving but he's also sad he won't see friends for a while.  This is his last hurrah.  Last night of course was the all-night senior graduation party (lots of adjectives there).  It was really quite a bit of fun.  And Tyke didn't hang out with the ladies much either.  Imagine that.  The first destination (after all of the waiting to leave) was Champs Karting in the Georgetown district of Seattle.  They had an indoor course for go-karts, a game room with DDR and stuff set up, a pool hall with other games, and then a casino.  Tyke played a lot of blackjack there.  Quite a lot actually.  Most of his 3 hours there was spent playing blackjack.  It was fun and Tyke didn't do too bad really.  It is pretty fun playing with a bunch of people for blackjack.  Especially since they made friends with the dealers.  Skippy, Dr. Phil, and Amed were living it up at the craps table.  They were playing there for a long time.  It's not that easy to win big though.  But Jew won tons at the roulette wheel.  He just kept doubling up.  After staying there for 3 hours everyone boarded up on the buses and Tyke and Dotti sat next to each other.  The next surprise stop was Seahawks Stadium where they went up to a suite and had two inflatable bouncy thingys and a dance floor and a place for Segway usage.  So that was fun.  Tyke got hurt some using the two inflatable bouncy thingys but they were really fun.  And they looked right over the field so when Stadium High School (that's who it was) was on the field it was pretty fun to watch.  Apparently time on the field costs a hell of a lot of money so that's why Issy didn't do it but Tyke doesn't mind, he might not have gone down for long anyway.  But it was fun hanging out there for a while.  At the end there was a hypnotist.  Now that was hilarious.  He had the volunteers doing lots of crazy things.  Tyke tried to volunteer but he didn't get picked so when he tried to do it on his own he couldn't focus cuz he had to go to the bathroom soooooooo bad.  It sucked.  He finally went and it was sooooooo refreshing.  But Tyke and Purdy really enjoyed the hypnotist and it was a great end to the night.  When they left there it was already light out and it was a little after 5 AM.  Tyke really was never tired, even when he got home at 6 in the morning.  He just went into bed and tried to fall asleep and boom he did.  He set his alarm for 3 PM and all of a sudden he heard his alarm go off and realized it was 3.  It came sooo quickly.  It was really nice though.  When Tyke got up he packed and got completely ready for Europe.  He managed to fully fit inside the small suitcase.  He did quite well to do so.  He isn't going to look as hot as he usually does but thats ok...he has nobody to impress there anyway.  But it will be fun.  At night Tyke called Tina, Purdy, Dotti, and Karla to see if they were free to hang out for a little just so Tyke could say goodbye in person.  Karla came over with Dudely and Stock and they had fun while they were there.  They said their goodbyes and then the rest of the guys were there and they played some games.  Tyke got to say goodbye to Skippy, Dr. Phil, Kinker, K-caj, and Macaroon in person so that was good.  Tina said she would stop by sometime but later on at night Tyke went down to Krispy Kreme with the gang and he left his phone at the house.  The suckiest part about the night was that he left his phone at home.  Because Tina called while he was gone asking if she could stop by on her way home to sorta say goodnight to Tyke and wish him well.  He tried to get a hold of her but couldn't.  The message she left for Tyke really made him sad.  He almost got teary eyed.  And he truly has no romantic feelings for her anymore but he still does think the world of her.  Not that he doesn't think the world of Karla or Purdy or Dotti.  Cuz he does.  Those 5 girls are so special to Tyke.  And that is really the main reason for Tyke's sadness in leaving.  Cuz if this was 3 years ago Tyke wouldn't have been that sad about leaving cuz he wasn't leaving anything behind for 19 days.  Now he is.  And that is tough.  Skippy of course will be missed as will Kinker and Amed, Dr. Phil, K-caj, Macaroon, Maniak, Tyronious, Mandy, DCups, Nene, Jew, MSwa, Piggy J (he called Tyke earlier in the night and they wished each other luck in their trips and also that he saw Kendal from Road Rules at the airport), and everyone else on Tyke's blog.  You guys are cool.  Good luck everyone.  This is going to be a fun trip so hopefully you all will have fun too.  And if you want a postcard but haven't talked to Tyke about it yet then leave a comment on the blog and he'll try to set something up to get your address.  He already knows of the girls and guy he will be sending postcards to.  And he will be able to blog at least once on the trip as he will be around internet cafes most likely.  But this is it.  The last blog in a while.  Long flight today...Tyke better not sleep much so that he can sleep a lot on the trip.  Damn...a little sad is Tyke.  The music isn't helping though.  Stupid donuts...stupid stupid stupid.  This could have been a great sendoff.  Don't look back.  Keep going forward.

      Quick little blog for now.  Because later on tonight Tyke will be out with the rest of the seniors.  So today was graduation.  It was pretty fun.  There was a lot of standing though and it would have been better without that but it was still fun doing it at Safeco Field.  The BBQ at the school was cool once the sun came out and made it not so cold.  It got a little chilly and then it got hot and then rainy.  But the gowns provided a nice little bit of insulation when it was cold.  After the BBQ they got on the buses and went to Safeco.  Being down underneath Safeco and on the field was pretty cool for Tyke since he loves baseball.  He took some dirt from the field, but upon realizing he had nothing to do with it, he threw it at Dudely Doo.  It was cool actually graduating but it still didn't feel right.  It just didn't feel like it was Tyke graduating.  How is he a senior???  It just isn't right.  When Tyke went up to get his "diploma" he did a little spin move before walking up the platform.  That was fun.  And he was on camera a lot too.  Up on the big screen.  His mom said she bought the DVD cuz he is on it so much.  He kept putting on a blank stare right into the camera whenever he saw it looking at him.  That was cool.  Well Tyke has to leave soon for the all-night party but after dinner his family went out to dinner and then he came home and didn't do anything.  But he did get an MP3 player so he has to decide if he wants that or not.  He hasn't made a definite decision yet actually.  It would be cool to have one but Tyke doesn't think it suits him as well as others who have one.  Well for you non-seniors out there have fun not being at the party tonight.  HA!

      Today involved one thing.  Partying.  Tyke got up at 11 and showered and dressed himself (no different from any other day) and then he worked on making gifts for Haras, Dotti, and Tina.  He (his mom) got some photo albums and he printed off some hot pictures of himself and put them in the albums.  It was kinda one of those things where he covers both bases.  Most people are gonna bring gifts so you can't be overlooked but it's also not so big of a deal that you have to go all out so he just did a nice little Tyke thing.  And they are great friends of Tyke's so he wanted to do something for them at least.  After he made the presents he got his Muse cd and went out to his car to drive up to Haras'.  Tyke got gas on the way and damn that's expensive.  Luckily Tyke doesn't have to pay for it himself.  At the party Tyke talked with K-Caj for a little bit when Haras was busy with the parents (there were a lot of adults there) and then Tig when she came over.  Tyke and Tig became a mini-duo at Haras' cuz they had the same schedule for the day, at least for the most part.  So they talked at Haras' for a while and it was really nice out so it made it a pleasant chat but then Tyke and Tig left for Tina's.  Tina's was really fun.  Tyke and Tig met up with Lyndon Johnson, Amyazing, Purdy, and other great ladies.  Tyke was of course the only guy there so that made it fun.  When Tyke hangs out with that group he is mostly the only guy there.  Or at least that's what Tyke and Tina thought.  After watching the hydros, looking through scrapbooks, eating food, and doing other stuff the girls all left so it was just Tyke and Tina.  But Tina was busy with all of the adults there so Tyke realized that he probably wasn't going to be the life of the party anymore so he tried to get a little more time with Tina and then when she got busy Tyke left.  He went over to Dotti's and met up with some new people.  Karla was there, Dudely Doo was there, Juhd was there, the list goes on and on.  It was a good time.  The pizza was really really good.  Tyke and Dotti chatted for only a little as she was pretty busy (as were all the hosts really) so Tyke just hung out by himself for a little.  Tyke ended up talking with Purdy's parents quite a bit.  He already had a relationship with them so it wasn't like it was a first time thing but he talked to them more than Purdy, at least up until later on that night.  Whoa...Tyke just looked to his right and in the reflection of the window he saw an ironing board set up behind him.  That might not sound weird but he just did like a double take and then kind of a jump back thing where he was surprised to see it there.  Sure it's only an ironing board but Tyke still was surprised to see it as he didn't notice it before now.  Anyway, at Dotti's Piggy J and Skramfejj came over so the three chatted for a little before heading up to Amyazing's party.  This party had the most people by far.  It was the most happening of all the parties Tyke went to so it was pretty fun.  Tyke talked with K-caj some more and Tank for a little and then Purdy came over so they talked for a little before she left and Tyke went to get his coat.  Tyke came back and chatted it up with Red Sox and some other people.  It was a good time.  When Tina came over later they kinda linked together and stayed together for a while.  Tyke also talked to Karla and Big Poppa Booty.  Karla's so fun to hang out with.  She's such a great party girl.  Totally Tyke-like.  Damn that's a great phrase.  Totally Tyke-like.  Just say it out loud, cuz Tyke just did.  There he did it twice more.  Just do it.  Back to the party...Tyke and Tina got to talk more at this party cuz she wasn't so busy but after a while they split a little and didn't talk as much.  Then Tyke and Red Sox talked for a while.  Tyke ended up staying for quite a bit longer than he expected.  He left at about 10:30.  Considering he wasn't even technically invited to this party, that is pretty long.  He was one of the last guys really.  But Tyke's cell phone was really pissing him off.  It was so messed up today.  It wasn't receiving calls, it wasn't connecting on phone calls, and it wouldn't even turn off.  Oh yeah, and the battery just started to kill itself for some reason.  Something better not be screwed up with it now, although he really doesn't need it again until July but that's still not acceptable.  That phone is less than a year old.  Come on!  Well Tyke is home now and tomorrow is quite a huge day.  Tyke officially graduates high school tomorrow and then is the 9 hour party.  The all nighter baby.  Let's hope Tyke's friends don't poop out on him.  He is going to rock that party.  He never really seems to get that tired so he doesn't expect to have much trouble with this party.  His eyes might have trouble though.  Yeah, he's been having some eye problems lately.  He should prolly take some eye drops with him.  But this isn't blogworthy anymore.  It is just Tyke talking to himself.  Well today was busy but tomorrow is even more busy.  Then comes a day off sorta and then wow...Europe.

      So only 2 days later but yep, Tyke is already blogging.  It has been a much better two days than every other day has been like so far.  But nonetheless Tyke will tell you what he did.  Yesterday he went to London and took a few subways and trains in order to get there.  He saw Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Parliament, and all of that kind of thing (he doesn't actually remember everything so he will leave it at that).  But it was pretty good.  And guess who Tyke saw at Buckingham Palace...yeah, none other than XXX, Vin Diesel.  Yeah, that was a little weird but he got some pics of him anyway so that was fun.  The scenery was really nice in London.  In one spot there was quite a few "adult" shops which were pretty funny to look at.  There were some girls standing outside the stores and walking by all those places with your mother is a little bit awkward.  It was funny.  After that Tyke got a Strawberries and Cream Frappucino at Starbucks (tastes just like a strawberry milkshake) and then he came home.  It was a good day though.  And today they went back to London.  This time Tyke went to the Tower of London (not that fun really but still got to see all the crown jewels) and also went to Greenwich and some other place.  It was decent.  The weather was really nice but all in all it wasn't as fun as yesterday.  A lot more walking today but Tyke is feeling better today so that means he is once again the most fit person here (his brother is out doing his own thing most of the time).  Tomorrow the family hops on a train for Edinburgh, Scotland and while there Tyke will get to see some cool scenery.  It's gonna be pretty good.  Hopefully they will be able to get back to England/France without being hurt by the rail strike coming up.  But the trip is getting better and Tyke can't believe it's already been 9 days.  He has another 10 more coming up though so he's really just halfway done.  Tyke's mom just took a picture of him.  She's crazy.  Tyke has been a master photographer for this trip.  Oh yeah, they went to Stowe Gardens today and that is a really picturesque area.  Great for picnics or just walking around.  There were two swans and their babies, or signets, swimming across a pond with a waterfall in the background...magnificent.  To sorta wrap it all up, the trip is getting better but now they move on to a new foreign area where Tyke will get to try to meet some new girls ;).  No luck so far.  It seems as though it is prom or something here because there are a lot of girls and guys dressed up and walking around outside.  Hmmm...whatev.  Ok, as much as you must want Tyke to keep writing, he is going to sign off now.  Hey Hun, thanks for the comments, good to know you're keeping up!

      This is the first blog by Tyke you will have seen in a week now.  And that is pretty cool.  But just so you know Tyke wrote everything you will read for a while in a journal so that is what you will be reading now:  So yes, Tyke is back for another blog.  He has had enough adventures for today that he really doesn't want to have the rest of the trip like this one.  But enough with the prepping, let's get to the nitty gritty.  Tyke ended up going to bed at about 3 AM on Monday night (???) no, no, Tuesday night/Wed morning.  He woke up at 7:40 to finish getting himself ready for the trip.  He had written a few emails already last night so he was done saying goodbye to people.  He did finish everything up though and ate some of a breakfast before the entire fam was finally ready to leave.  THey left Tyke's house at 9 AM and were picked up by a family friend.  They got to the airport and there was quite a long line to check in at Air Canada.  After they did check in they went through security for the first of many times.  They got to the gate and had sometime to kill before departing so Tyke got a Tazo tea from Starbucks (it was gross) and then he walked around and got some Pringles and a hat from Wazzu.  The first flight left Seattle at about 12 PM and arrived in Toronto at about 6:50 PM EDT.  The flight wasn't all that bad.  The movie was Starsky and Hutch and Tyke had a chicken dinner.  He looked at his can of Pringles mid-flight and saw they had changed to being full to the top of the can because of the change in air pressure.  It was pretty cool.  Right now Tyke is writing down everything while sitting back in his first cottage in Tingewick.  It's an interesting little house.  It's quite quaint.  But Tyke definitely can't get ahead of himself.  The arrival to Toronto was met with an onslaught of activity in the airport.  They had to switch flights in order to get to London but the new flight was in a different terminal.  They had to quickly get through security and to the new terminal.  They had some confusion about whether or not they had to claim their baggage but they were told they didn't need to.  Damn though...Tyke is just so incredibly tired right now.  It is 7:40 AM in Washington and Tyke has had less than 2 hours of sleep for the last 24 hours.  Less than 7 hours in the last 48 and less than 13 hours in the last 72.  Tyke is a tired traveler.  But he better get used to it soon or else.  Back to the story.  The family went through Toronto's airport before they had to get on an airport shuttle that took them closer to their destination.  But they had to take a 2nd shuttle and this one took them on the runway!!!!  It was quite a convoluted mess but they made it to their next flight in time.  The next flight was a long one.  Not the longest of the trip though.  From Toronto they departed for the 6 and a half hour flight to London's Heathrow Airport.  The flight wasn't too bad but Tyke started to get a sore throat (more on that later).  They arrived at about 8:30 and went through a long customs line before going to pick up their baggage.  Here's where it all snowballed.  They stood around the baggage claim waiting for their luggage.  They stood, and stood, and stood, and yes, stood.  They waited with a lot of other people only to find their baggage wasn't coming.  So they got in a different line and filled out some paperworke where the luggage could be sent to when it arrived.  Tyke saw a very very fine looking girl waiting in line.  But they ended up leaving the airport without their luggage.  Then they had to find a way home.  They went on a long walk to the bus terminal only to find they would have to wait 3 hours for a bus that cost 140£ (280 bucks approx).  Then they walked all the way back to the airport to find a train to start them on their way.  They took a train.  The next train was longer and they got off that in Milton Keynes.  Once in Milton Keynes they went outside to find that they weren't in the right spot for their rental car.   So they got back on the train and got off on the next stop.  Here they walked outside to an Enterprise car agency where they asked for help in retrieiving their car.  They found a really nice guy who went out of his way to drive them to the other rental car agency which would have been about a 40 minute walk.  THey got to the agency and got their car, a Saab 9 3.  It's a nice car and has tiptronics.  Needless to  say, Tyke was a little bit tired by this point.  Then they got in the car for another adventure.  Of course the steering wheel is on the right side and you drive on the left side.  Oh, and there are about 30 million roundabouts.  Every 45 seconds you run into a roundabout and they are tricky devils at first.  Tyke's dad kept drifting off the side of the road too cuz the streets are narrow.  They finally got to their house though and it's a nice little cottage with 3 floors (Tyke videotaped it so you can see it) but by this time Tyke was dead.  Once their bags finally arrived they got dinner at BK (they're everywhere here) and then some groceries.  Then Tyke came home and went right to bed.  The next morning Tyke woke up and felt like shit.  His throat hurt, his body was sore, and he just felt crappy.  His dad was sick too so he stayed home but Tyke decided to go out with his bro and mom.  They went to Warwick Castle which is really cool and they stayed there for a while.  Tyke felt bad for a while but they stayed until they decided they wanted food.  They got lunch and some things for Tyke before finally heading home.  Once they got home, Tyke went straight to bed (3 PM) and got up the next morning.  Oh yeah, the first night Tyke slept for 14 hours.  On Saturday morning Tyke got up and his right ear was throbbing with pain and he couldn't hear out of it very well.  His throat hurt a little bit too.  After some talking, they took Tyke to the "hospital" and got him looked at.  Of course it was weird cuz Tyke wasn't English but the Dr. still saw him.  He looked in his right ear and right away said "there's a nasty infection."  Tyke hasn't had an ear infection since he was like 5.  So he was prescribed some amoxycillin and then sent home.  Tyke has to take 3 capsules a day for 5 days.  So far he's taken 4 caps.  He came home on Saturday while the rest of his family did a few things that ended up sucking anyway.  Stratford=Disneyland without the fun.  But Tyke picked up the Da Vinci code and read that for most of the day.  He read 38 chapters in all and the book is really quite good.  He also watched some boring British TV but OC and Dawson's Creek were on too.  Other than that Tyke hasn't done anything and today his mom and bro went to some museums while Tyke stayed home.  It is only Sunday and Tyke has felt pretty homesick at times.  The weather has been cloudy at times with occasional rain but not all that bad.  However, back home it was supposed to be hot.  Just so you know Tyke is thinking about you guys a lot.  Especially when he is couped up in bed.  He can't wait until he can enjoy his trip and stop feeling homesick but he's really looking forward to July 5th.  Cheers mate!  Tyke out... Here is the briefing for Tyke's events on Sunday.  He woke up and of course his ear hurt so stayed home doing nothing.  This is becoming the same old story for Tyke's trip.  He already mentioned earlier what his mom and bro did so he'll tell you what Tyke did.  He grabbed the Da Vinci Code and read all of it in his bed upstairs cuz it smells nice.  He read 270 pages today.  All of the 454 page book was finished then.  2 days of really good reading for him which is why he wanted to do it.  But basically all Tyke has done is read, go to the bathroom, eat Doritos, drink, and then sit in his bed listening to the noises in his ear and the tick of the clock.  The ear noise is like he is at a freeway on a windy day with cars whizzing by, just it is toned down a lot and only coming from his right ear.  His right ear hurts, his right nostril is plugged, and the right side of his throat is sore.  Well Tyke pulled out some senior pics for a while to look at and it reminded him of home but he is anxiously awaiting his next amoxycillin dose hoping it improves his condition.  Man this sucks hardcore. Tomorrow Tyke might finally be able to post these writings Tyke keeps in a journal.  Let's hope.  Hold on...Tyke's trying to swat a fly...Ok done.  Well today was a change from yesterday.  In the morning Tyke woke up and felt a little better, his ear didn't hurt but he had a very very stuffed nose.  He decided he would do they day's activities, though.  There was this really old cathedral in Salisbury and England is cool just because it has history, really.  There were some great shops too.  Tyke has liked English clothing so far and he got a shirt and some jeans but passed on some cool 12 £ shoes cuz he already has so many pairs of shoe for a guy.  He still felt crappy the whole day but he fought through it.  They went to Subway for lunch and then drove on.  They couldn't get a great sight of Stonehenge cuz it was closed cuz of summer solstice celebrations.  The pictures are misleading.  It's right by a road and, well it's just not the same as the pics.  It's still cool.  They also saw Old Sarum which is the remnants of an old castle.  THat was alright.  On the way back they did some more shopping.  Then they came home to watch England beat Croatia at football.  And now Tyke is going to sleep.  Best wishes.  Love ya'll! Damn, yet another day passes and Tyke still hasn't recovered.  Last night Tyke's left ear began to howl in pain.  It was a constant throb that was oh so very painful.  He took some asprin and that eventually quelled the pain but he still lost quite a bit of sleep because the pain was so fierce.  In the morning his left ear was still plugged like his right and his nose and throat were still sore.  So in the morning he went back to the doctor's and saw a new doctor.  The infection in the rigth ear has died down but the left ear started up.  So the doc gave Tyke some tips and set him up with a new prescription.  Erythromycin is the name.  This stuff better actually work or else Tyke might be sent home to the U.S.  When his family moves on to Scotland.  So yeah that's pretty big news.  Some more news is that there is a rail-worker strike starting on the day Tyke leaves for Edinburgh on train.  THey should be able to use the train before the strike hurts but they'll have to wait and see.  This is really quite the eventful trip.  Everything seems to be going wrong.  But Tyke did pick up two books today.  Angels and Demons-prequel to Da Vinci Code-and Deception Point-by same author as other two books.  So at least Tyke has something to do now.  But still, he's been sick everyday since last Wednesday.  This is incredible.  Yet another update on Tyke's progress.  Last night he watched some football, read, and got a facial.  Well sort of.  Tyke got a steaming pot of boiling water, put his face over it, and put a towel over his head to keep him enclosed.  It was basically a humidifier but it also had the bonus of giving Tyke a facial.  It sorta helped Tyke.  It didn't really clear anything out but it made him feel better.  Then he took his meds and went to bed.  He woke up the next morning (it's now Wednesday) and his cars were still plugged but now his throat was more phlegmy than his nose.  He still didn't feel good enough to go to London though so his bro went alone while his mom went to Blenheim Palace later on.  His dad, too, is still somewhat sick as well so his family is reeling.  Oh yeah and the rail strike next Tuesday meant that Tyke's mom couldn't book a train back from Edinburgh yet so that's not good.  But if Tyke doesn't get any better he might be flying home.  And also, the rain has come in and the next time sunny days might appear would be in France.  About 10 days away.  The fun just won't stop, will it???  Tonight Tyke is scheduled for another humidifier and then going to an internet cafe in Buckingham where he can actually blog this.  So hopefully that will happen.  Tyke's right ear might be starting to clear out now though which is a good sign.  And Tyke finished Angels and Demons today too.  600 more pages read.  That's 1000+ read so far.  Tyke's a reading machine.  That's all for now...Europe's been interesting so say the least.  Ok, so that was that.  Right now Tyke is in a hurry so he has to finish up.  But just know that you are all being missed but hopefully Tyke can start feeling better.  Just pray for him.  Cuz yeah, Tyke's taken a startling new interest in religion.  The study of mainly but spiritual questions are coming up now too.  Amed, aren't you excited!!

      Tyke is really getting exctied to come home now.  The hours just keep ticking away and now Tyke has counted it to be 41 hours until his plane is to touch down in Sea-Tac.  Right now Tyke is in an internet cafe in Paris and he just checked out of the Hotel Yllen and now he has to wait until 4 PM to get onto the Eurostar for a 2 and a half hour train ride from Paris to London crossing the Channel underwater.  It will be a good time hopefully as the train goes 180 mph and will be underwater for about 25 minutes Tyke thinks where it will be just black outside.  This is going to be a nice little finish to the time over here.  Not having to switch trains a lot or do anything stupid like that.  But yesterday was a good day.  Tyke saw the Louvre for a while, Mona Lisa included.  The Mona Lisa is pretty cool.  The eyes really do follow you and Tyke couldn't decide whether or not she was smiling.  Venus de Milo was also there and it was pretty impressive.  Most of the stuff there was impressive though.  Then Tyke went to the Arc d'Triomphe and saw Champs d'elysees as well as seeing some other cool things there.  Then he saw the Eiffel Tower and got dinner near there.  And he took a boat tour of the Seine and got a different view of Notre Dame which he saw earlier in the day.  Basically, everything over here is cool.  He really likes it but also has gotten a little tired and is coming down with a new sickness.  He has a sore throat again and is trying to get rid of that.  But last night was the last night that his brother is going to be with them.  He continues through Europe for another 2 and a half weeks while the rest of Tyke's family goes home tomorrow.  Damn, Tyke is so excited.  It's been a pretty good trip but he still is looking forward to home so very much.  Tomorrow Tyke will spend a little time in London before he gets on the plane which will take him all the way to Vancouver, BC and then he hops on a small plane to take him to Sea-Tac.  It will be about a 10-12 hour ride all told and Tyke is supposed to get in at 7:30.  So hopefully he will be home at 9PM Sunday, July 4th.  Give him a call on his cell if you wanna hang out that night.  Maybe he'll call you back when he gets back.  Haha, of course he'll call.  Right now he just got on AIM as the computer he is at has it but of course it is 3AM at home so nobody is online.  Oh well, he still got to be online.  The first time in 18 days for Tyke.  That's the longest he's been offline since he has had it.  Yeah, he's a freak.  Time to go now though.  This might be the last time Tyke gets to blog but he will be in London tomorrow so if he needs to pass some time he can always find a place there.  But if not, Tyke will see you Sunday night!!!  At least in words he will.

      Ok, this is going to be a weird and quick blog.  Tyke is in Paris right now and he is at his hotel where the computer is different than what he is used to. But Tyke left Edinburgh a few days ago and the train sucked.  They got stopped a lot because of "problems" so they were on the same train for 7 days.  But even when the train got in they still had to get to Dover which is Southern England and they were in London which is not Southern.  That was a bit of a journey in itself.  They finally got in much much later and the room they were in was quite small.  But they got through it.  Running out of time.  The next day they went to France by ferry and that was another strange trip.  The next day they saw a bunch of the beaches from WWII and took pics and videos.  But then they had to drive to Paris and that really took a lot of work.  The streets here in France are not well marked so it was very difficult to get to the hotel.  It took 7 and a half hours when it should have taken about 4.  But they did get in and their hotel is fine.  Tyke also can see the Eiffel Tower from his room if he leans out a bit but his fear of heights doesn't so much like that.  But today he will get to see the tower and the Louvre and other things like that.  It's now Friday here so Tyke is almost home and he is definitely ready to be back home.  But now Tyke is out of time so bonsoir!

      Back to back days with a blog...Tyke ain't doing too badly now is he?  Last night Tyke made it an easy night.  He watched Monty Python's Life of Brian in the flat and then tuned on the toob to watch some football as Croatia pounded Denmark.  Other than that he didn't do anything.  This morning he slept in pretty late as his brother went up to Arthur's Seat (the mountain) and his dad did some bus tours.  His mom went up to Sterling Castle which is an hour's train ride away but is the site of some great history.  It is where William Wallace fought (Braveheart) and Tyke's mom and brother are all related to Wallace as Tyke's mom found out in her genealogy research.  So there was quite a bit that she wanted to see up there but Tyke didn't want to spend most of the day only doing that.  Instead Tyke stayed home and did his own thing.  He watched some parts of some movies before heading out for a bite to eat.  He saw his brother on his way back and they both grabbed some sandwiches.  Then Tyke's dad came back and Tyke left again.  He went to a mall like area where he looked at some clothes and got an Italian sweatshirt and a Scotland shirt as well.  There is this one store that is just so cheap.  They have most everything marked down to really cheap apparently for some summer sale.  Tyke looked at that pair of shoes he saw earlier again and tried them on only to find that they weren't super comfortable so he decided to not get them, even if they were quite cheap.  He continued to walk around and then finally just came back home.  Then his dad started watching a movie and there wasn't any food so Tyke decided to go back out and came to the cafe and is going to grab a bite to eat in a second.  Now Tyke is finding out that he has nothing more to say really.  He has written a few postcards today and planned on sending them out but found out he doesn't have the addresses with him as Tyke's mom does.  So he has to wait to do that.  But Tyke doesn't know if he will be able to blog in a while so he had to do it once more.  Time keeps on ticking.  Only one more week left.  Let's see...it's 8AM right now back in Washington.  That's pretty early.  Bye now.

      Tyke is now in Edinburgh, Scotland at an internet cafe in the train station.  It will be a somewhat quick blog again as he is on the clock for money but thats ok.  Yesterday Tyke and the family got on a train in King's Cross Station in London and headed northward for the great Scot-land.  It was about a 4 hour train ride and Tyke spent the first hour playing cards with his dad and then he listened to music for the next 3 hours.  It was really a pretty easy little train ride and even though it was wet and rainy outside the scenery was pretty nice too.  It had just poured earlier apparently so it was a bit surprising that the train tracks weren't flooded.  Once they got into Edinburgh they took a taxi to their housing.  It is really an incredibly nice place to stay.  The place is an apartment that some guy rents out and it is a really great flat.  He has made it pretty nice and modern as it has a great LCD screen for the TV, DVD player, CD player, CDs, DVDs, new furniture, and just so much great stuff.  There are multiple rooms and 4 beds too.  Tyke is going to go out and film the place when he gets back so you can see it later.  But last night Tyke just watched some football and went to sleep.  If you didn't know, it gets darker later on at night here as well as getting light earlier on in the morning so the days are of course longer.  That means it is still light out pretty much whenever Tyke goes to bed at night.  Then again, the latest Tyke has gone to bed is like 10:30.  But today Tyke woke up about 9 and then got himself all ready and took his Erythromycin.  He still isn't fully recovered as he has a runny nose and still can't hear out of his right ear very well, although the left one isn't too bad.  But he'll hopefully be fine soon.  Tyke came down to the train station in the morning and got breakfast, came here to scope things out, and then his mom got a few things checked out for traveling.   After that they went up to Edinburgh Castle which was marvelous.  The views were spectacular and he really loved the visit there.  He began to walk around on his own and then just went off separately.  He decided to go down the street his apartment his on and look for The Royal Palace at Holyrood (or something like that).  But he didn't quite find how to get in so he walked all the way around it and then past this huge mountain and took some pictures and then found himself an hour later on the other side of the bridge from his flat.  Needless to say he was lost but he found out how to get back and went to the flat.  He doesn't have a key to the house so he buzzed the place to see if his mom was back yet but she wasn't so he had to wait around for her.  She didn't come so Tyke came down here and has been here for 20 minutes.  He'll go back to the flat after this and hopefully he will be able to get back in soon.  But if not oh well.  This city is really beautiful.  He stays here one more night after tonight and then leaves on Tuesday.  Then he goes to Dover, Calais, and Paris before heading back to London for one more night.  Then he travels all of Sunday and gets back Sunday night in Washington.  So maybe he will see you then but if not, later yo.

      When Tyke woke up this morning and looked in the mirror the first person that came to mind was Kanye West.  Tyke thinks he looks like Kanye West from the Through the Wire video.  Well, at least his cheeks look the same.  The skin color is a little different though :).  But Tyke still didn't have much pain at all today.  He was more swollen and you could tell but he hasn't been in constant pain all day.  Just some minor discomfort in the places where the stitches are.  So he has gotten through this surgery incredibly well.  He has been so lucky.  However, because of his laid-up status he doesn't have much to blog about.  He laid around and watched TV all day while eating ice cream but didn't get out of the house once.  He didn't even take a shower.  He watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail again but then he just watched baseball and other programs for a while.  Purdy called him a little before 5 though and asked if she could come over with Ekul and Dotti.  That was cool.  Nobody else has come over so it was great to see some people.  And Tyke hadn't seen Dotti since he got back either so that was really a great treat.  But of course it is always great to see Purdy.  They stayed for about 45 minutes but then left so Tyke went back to laying on the couch alone.  He has iced his cheeks a lot to keep the swelling down but he's not sure how well that's working.  He'll find out tomorrow.  Right now he is taking a little break from lying on the couch so that he can get his blog done.  But in a few minutes he'll go back to lying down and thinking about how great his life could be with one minor change.  Since that won't happen he will just stick with looking like Kanye West for a while.

      So today was Tyke's wisdom teeth surgery.  And to tell you the truth it was pretty good, in fact during the surgery he was having a pretty good time.  He got up 15 minutes after his alarm went off and then left the house about 9:20.  The appointment was at 10 and started about 10:20 as there was a pretty girl before Tyke that went a litle longer than expected.  She came out hiding her mouth for some reason, apparently not wanting to show the world her face.  But Tyke then got ready for his thingy.  The laughing gas was applied through the nose tube and it was just like expected.  At first it made Tyke feel light-headed and a little nauseous (last time he had real anesthetic he got really sick) but he never got any worse.  He started to sort of drift off a little bit but then they added more O2 to the gas and then Tyke really didn't feel the gas effects at all.  He was pretty relaxed but he was never nervous in the first place so it didn't really matter.  The actual operation was quite simple.  They took out all 4 and the worst part was when they took out the bottom two teeth as, although they were the easiest to take out, they were big so it hurt to pull them out of his mouth.  It really didn't feel that bad though.  And when Tyke was getting numbed it was weird too as he could feel the needle, or whatever it was, going into him.  But again it wasn't that bad.  After the surgery he felt his lower lip and mouth and it felt so cool cuz it was fat and numb so it felt like he was feeling someone else's skin and it felt really smooth and was great to caress.  At least until he realized he was feeling his mouth up.  At home he has been taking out the gauze and putting it back in a lot as he has been bleeding pretty consistently but now the pain really hasn't been there.  Some minor discomfort but he hasn't really had to take any Vicodin.  He has of course taken some but he hasn't really needed to.  But he can't chew for a few more days and he will still have to get the stitches out next week which might not be fun.  But for now Tyke feels fine other than the nausea that has started to come back.  But maybe it's just cuz he hasn't slept in a while.  So he should probably go do that now.  He can talk alright but he doesn't always want to answer his phone.  So you can still call it but if he doesn't answer, just leave a message.  He'll make the next move.

      ...Laziness strikes once again...Well today was a fine day.  Fine as in decent, not like 'damn that girl is fiiiine.'  However, that does lead Tyke to something he will say later.  10 o'clock was once again the wake up time for Tyke.  Tomorrow will be different though.  After getting up Tyke ate food and watched tv until about 1.  Then he called Tina to see if she was free at night but Tyke had forgotten that the birthday party for Ekul was tonight so she of course was busy.  But that's ok, at least she was excited to talk to Tyke.  After that Tyke left and went to run his errands.  He drove out to Preston to return the mail keys for their old post office box.  Now all the first-class mail that gets sent there will be forwarded to Tyke's current house.  Then he came back to town and went to BECU again to get his checking account established.  But their computers were down so Tyke then had to just work around that and deposit some money while he was at it.  About $400 to be more precise.  Then he went to Starbucks and got his new favorite drink there, strawberries and creme with whipped cream.  Basically it's just a strawberry milkshake.  It tastes really good.  This brings Tyke back to the thought he touched on earlier.  Fiiiine girls.  The girl that was working the cash register was quite pretty.  She had a striking face which is really what guys are drawn to, or at least Tyke is.  The head on a girl is the most important, brains and face.  She was probably new there but she didn't exactly have everything under control.  But you know what?  Nobody seemed to care.  None of the customers were getting upset with her and Tyke certainly had patience (although he does anyway) with her.  Maybe this was just a coincidence but Tyke thinks that the fact that she was beautiful probably doesn't hurt her.  It turned out later on when Tyke got dinner he ran into another good looking girl working but she at least was pretty competent with her work.  However, she did almost forget to ask Tyke to pay before she gave him his dinner at the drive-thru window.  This helps to show that being good-looking sure doesn't hurt your chances in life.  But annnnyway...Tyke got a haircut after his S&C.  Then he watched the graduation DVD cuz he found it on a table and fast forwarded to try to see how often he was in it and you know what...not that often!!!  They cut out at least 3 times where Tyke was staring straight at the camera and he knows he was on the big screen at Safeco.  He still had one good stare that they caught though.  But they didn't show his spin move when receiving his diploma either but that wasn't that obvious.  After that he got dinner and then eventually took out the trash and then went out.  He picked up Macaroon at his house and then went down to Bannerwood Park to watch Kinker's baseball game.  They got there after 9 runs had already been scored for Kinker's team but oh well it was still fun for Tyke to come out to a game as he hasn't been to one in forever.  Macaroon didn't seem to think it was that great but he's not a true baseball fan like Tyke.  If you go to a baseball game and you're a true baseball fan you will at least enjoy the fact that it's baseball you're watching.  Come on...baseball=awesome.  Then after that they went up to Dr. Phil's house and got a poker game going with those three, Dr. Phil's dad, Amed, and K-caj later on.  Tyke played well from the beginning and was pretty powerful or at least in good shape up until his all-in decision where he really just lost the hand flat out.  But he only lost $5 so it wasn't a big deal.  He still got the 10 that Macaroon owed him from yesterday so he still made 5 today.  Then Tyke came home and blogged and guess what tomorrow is...wisdom teeth surgery.  Yay!  Hopefully it won't be bad.  Tyke hasn't really thought about it at all and still isn't really thinking of it.  He doesn't expect it to be bad and he's looking forward to people hopefully coming over to visit him after he's done.  But if they don't that's ok.  It's not like Tyke is leaving for college in a little over a month.  Oh wait...

      It sure has been a while since Tyke has seen Alf but tonight he got to see it!  Not before he did a few other things though.  He got up at 11:30 today cuz he really knew he wasn't going to have anything to do during the day without his car.  But he still decided to get up before noon.  He then took a shower, listened to music and watched tv while snacking on some Cheetos Puffs.  Tyke watched Master and Commander later on in the day when he got pretty bored.  It was a pretty good movie but the middle of it was a little boring.  Then as time kept on passing Tyke had pizza that his dad brought home.  After chowing down he went with his dad to pick up his mom's van in the shop as it had been fixed.  So now Tyke has his car back.  And he is glad for that.  Once that was over he decided he would try to set something up.  He finally did and it involved hanging out at his house of course.  Amed and Macaroon came on over before being joined by Maniak.  They played some poke and although Amed was way up for a while Tyke turned his luck around and ended up being up 13 at the end of it.  But Kinker came in and took some of other people's money too so really everyone ended up about equal to what they put in.  Once they finished playing poker the big crowd came over.  Naan, MSwa, Tank, HeadRed, Dudely Doo, and Kalia all came over.  It was really cool to have a change of pace and have new people over.  They made it a great get together.  Tyke of course supplied the goods (pop and pizza) and everyone seemed to have a nice old time.  They watched ESPN, Wild Boyz, Seinfeld, and just talked up a good time.  It really did turn out to be the party house like his away message said.  So he had a great night.  And tomorrow he is gonna get his hair cut and then at night he's gonna try to get a group to go bowling at Hillcrest.  If you want to come just let Tyke know.

      Tyke's back to his usual antics.  Going out til after midnight, coming home, and blogging.  And trying his best to cover the gaping hole he feels so often in himself.  Today was a great day though and it is days like this that let Tyke know that he is so lucky to be who he is.  As you should know Tyke already had big plans for his day but he sorta got lazy to start them off.  He woke up at 10 instead of 9 and then sat in bed for a half hour and tried to figure out why his mom's van was outside but he wasn't sure if she was home.  So after showering he walked all the way around his house to try to find her but couldn't so he decided that she just wasn't home.  Then he played with his MP3 player for a while.  He deleted a lot of the songs on there that he didn't like listening to in Europe and then put a lot more in the deleted's place.  It took a while but it was worth it.  Right now Tyke is sitting at the computer typing away while "Vindicated" by Dashboard Confessional plays over and over as it is on repeat.  Such a great song.  The lyrics don't apply to Tyke right now but the melody is just so great.  Well actually Tyke now added Hands Down to the playlist so now two DC songs are playing.  Hands Down, one of Tyke's all-time favorite songs.  Well while Tyke was doing his MP3 thing he got a call from Purdy asking if he wanted to come over.  So Tyke quickly got ready and left.  He went over to her house and they greeted each other for the first time in 3 weeks.  After seeing each other almost every single day for the entire school year it sure did suck not seeing Purdy this whole time.  And Dotti, Karla, Tina, everyone.  It was really hard to get through it.  Tyke has been taking the time with others for granted way too much.  But today he didn't take for granted.  They went to Evangel, Kinko's (man there are some stupid/weird people working there), Bell Square, and that cosmetics store by Ted Meyer.  Tyke told every detail about his 3 weeks to Purdy and she hopefully wasn't bored by it but hey, she asked to hear about it.  Tyke realized while telling everything that it was hard to recall every single thing he did cuz there was so much.  But it also took him a long time to tell everything.  But he did and it was great to spend some quality time with her.  Tyke got a great smoothie at Orange Julius and they ran into Macaroon and K-caj unexpectedly at Brookstone.  Damn there is some comfortable stuff there.  It's fabbbbbulous!  But they spent a while there before finally satisfying Purdy's shopping needs and then they went back to Purdy's house where they split up for a few hours.  Tyke went to Safeway to the BECU branch to try to set up his checking account but of course since he is a youngeon and still a minor he couldn't do it right there since he needed his parent's signature.  So he got the stuff to do it later.  And he ran into Commander Cool who works there so they talked for a few minutes which was "cool" (get it? cuz that's his name too).  Then Tyke went to the post office to pick up all the held mail from the last 3 weeks.  He got it and, as he told Karla tonight, it was like Xmas for Tyke to look at all the mail he had waiting for him.  He loves getting mail.  It's so fantastic.  Especially when it is money!  And he got his grades too, 2.45 dropping him to a 3.2 GPA total.  Yep, a lot of people seem to have higher expectations for Tyke's GPA's.  Come on, give him some credit.  Then he looked at his dorm assignment for WSU.  Much to his chagrin he found out that he was not in his 1st choice for halls, not even his second choice in fact.  He got his 3rd choice, Stephenson.  So he isn't with Ekul or Kinker.  His roommate is Brett North from Tacoma (anyone know him for some odd reason?).  So Tyke was pretty bummed by that for a while.  He wanted to be in the same dorm as Ekul.  It would be really fun.  But of course Tyke can't get his way everytime (or a lot of the time in his eyes).  After his disappointment set in he had dinner and waited until 7:20 to leave for Purdy's again.  He got there, chatted a little with Purdy and her parents and then Naan came too.  Then they went up to Ekul's house and picked him up.  Then they went to the UW campus for The Inn.  It's like Refuge was but the college version.  Refuge was better but this is still good.  Tyke will make it a regular occurrence.  While the lecture was being preached Tyke just kept thinking about his own life and what he was missing.  He tried to find in himself something that he could use to fill that void but he knew there was only one of 2 things that can fill it.  Tyke doesn't know if he'll find either for a while.  It isn't like either is just going to jump out at him and magically send some sign that Tyke easily recognizes.  It's going to take patience and Tyke has to hold onto the last threads of patience he has in order to keep sane.  But it's really getting to be troublesome.  Tyke had forgotten what it was like sitting at home every night in the dark at the computer wondering what it would be like to have that hole filled.  However, every time he tries to fill the hole by reaching out to something he finds himself recoil back into a familiar pain that strikes him throughout his body.  It starts softly and then pulses steadily until he can feel his blood carry the discomfort to his chest and there it grows.  Maybe that made it easier to connect with Tyke but if not, don't worry.  Tyke doesn't want you to know what it is Tyke feels.  It isn't all that pleasant.  But he knows that everyone must go through it at some time.  Well after The Inn the 4 drove to Wendy's and got food and then went back to Purdy's and watched TV until they all left.  Then Tyke came home, cleaned out his car for his mom who is driving it tomorrow cuz her van has died for some reason and then he came downstairs to listen to music and blog.  And now that he has completed the blog he will finish off the last playing of Vindicated and try to vindicate himself of the pain by sleeping for hours.  If you want to hang out with Tyke tomorrow, which is possible if you have read this far in tonight's blog, you'll have to set something up either at his house or pick him up cuz he'll be car-less til his mom gets home.  Bye for now.

      Although in reality it is like the 21st day of summer, to Tyke it felt like the first one.  Actually, it just felt like a normal day.  Tyke didn't really do anything that was abnormal.  He got up at around 10:30 on his own and then he did some laundry and planned out his day a little.  Jew got some tennis games going and Tyke joined in.  He hadn't played tennis in quite a long time though so he knew he wouldn't be very good.  But at around 3 he joined up with Macaroon, K-caj, Jew, Amed, and a few others for some tennis antics.  It was pretty hot out it seemed to Tyke even though it was only mid-70s.  But Tyke is used to the low to mid 60s so this was a very pleasant change.  And it was mostly sunny with few clouds so that was a change as well.  The tennis was fun.  In singles Tyke beat Macaroon in a best of 5 games series by winning the last game after a few deuces.  It was really a good matchup.  Both sides had unforced errors but Tyke was able to play off of Macaroon's pretty well.  Then in doubles Tyke and Macaroon played K-caj's team and gave them a pretty good run for their money.  K-caj actually plays tennis so he was of course good.  But Tyke's team started playing well for a while on the last game but they still lost.  During the tennis matches Tyke got a call from Purdy and they chatted for a few minutes and made plans for tomorrow so that gave Tyke an extra little boost for the next matchup Tyke had.  They won that one.  After tennis though Tyke went down with the gang to South Cove beach and they had a nice swim and fun on the dock.  It sure did feel great being in the water.  He hasn't been in the lake in months.  After that Tyke went home and had a nice American meal.  Barbequed hamburgers, corn on the cob, and potato salad (although Tyke doesn't actually like that).  Then Tyke did some laundry and helped out some before setting up a little get together later on.  Tyke was joined by Kinker, K-caj, Macaroon, and later on Amed.  They played Risk and Tyke ended up winning after taking over every single country on the globe.  He really played extremely well.  He didn't make a single move wrong.  It was domination at its finest.  Now Tyke is going to go to bed, get up early, retrieve the mail from the post office, try to set up a checking account, and then hang out with Purdy.  It's looking to be a really great day.  Here's to the night (good song but no meaning here).

      If Tyke could really put into words how incredibly excited he is to be back home then he would probably do that right now.  But all he can think of to say is that he is "really excited" to be home.  It can all be summed up with Tyke's fondness for his American keyboard.  He knows where all of the keys are and he can touch them with ease.  It sure does make typing out his blog quite a bit easier.  Speaking of ease, Tyke feels very much at ease right now being back home.  The trip was fun but for the last week Tyke was really feeling like he was ready to go home.  The first 9 days were spent in this quaint, but boring, little town of Tingewick which was about 10 minutes away from anything resembling city-life.  This wouldn't have been as bad if Tyke didn't feel quite ill for the entire time there.  If they were in the actual city of London or at least near a train station then everyone else could have done as they pleased and just come and gone with only the business of having one key to the house to deal with.  But instead they were stuck relying on the driving around to the nearest train station in the rental car they had.  This was also made worse by the fact that Tyke's parents are old and can't drive when faced with new situations.  The driving is done on the left and this is made worse with narrow lanes, a lack of a shoulder, and frequent roundabouts.  The roundabouts actually made things easier once you figure out who has the right of way and what lane exits to what turn.  England has it done pretty well with the roundabout system.  When Tyke did actually get to go out and do stuff the trains were pretty easy to use but they did use up a lot of time and were somewhat crowded.  All of the sights Tyke saw were really quite neat.  Westminster Abbey got a little boring after a while as everything Tyke saw was the same to him and eventually it lost it's appeal.  Not that it isn't worth visiting or that it isn't beautiful, but Tyke couldn't spend a whole day there for sure.  Warwick Castle was really neat, Salisbury Cathedral rocked, Buckingham Palace was ok (especially cuz it was funny seeing Vin Diesel of all people there), and Stonehenge probably would have been cooler if Tyke got to be stopped when he saw it but instead he just got the drive-by glances.  The train ride to Edinburgh wasn't bad and had some pretty scenery on the way there.  It was a little different than Washington but pretty similar.  More rolling hills than here though.  Edinburgh's sites were made much more enticing by the fact that they were staying in the middle of the city on the street where all the action was, and that they were in a wonderful apartment with full amenities.  The castle had great views and the city was pretty clean with great architecture.  Leaving Edinburgh ended up sucking because the train ride to Dover was hellish.  They just got unexpectedly stopped for a while on a couple of occasions.  Supposedly there was a problem with the overhead electrical cords and it turned out they weren't lying as Tyke saw the wreckage when they finally passed it.  But Dover wasn't all that cool once they got there.  A pretty slow town at night (as most places seemed to be) nothing really happened.  The castle was huge, but since they got in late at night and had to leave early the next morning, they never got to see it up close.  The hotel there was smoky and boring but it was only for a night.  The "hovercraft" to Calais, France wasn't that bad and it allowed for Tyke to see the white cliffs of Dover which were actually quite cool.  Then they got into France and immediately found out that they were in a foreign land.  They got in at 12:02 and needed to rent a car so they went to the booths where you could do so but everyone was closed.  Not to mention the fact that they didn't even have to clear French customs to get into the country.  Everyone was gone because it was 12 o'clock.  That meant that their 2 hour lunch break had begun and it seemed as though the entire country shut down for the two hours.  Most businesses were closed unless they were food oriented so Tyke's family had to get some lunch while they waited for a car agency to open up.  Finally they got a car, a Volkswagen Golf for the 4 of them and their 4+ bags of luggage.  It was a bit of a tight squeeze but it wasn't terrible.  At least they were driving on the same side of the road as the U.S.  Oh yeah, that reminds Tyke...the English drivers go incredibly fast.  Everyone speeds everywhere.  Their little cars really get going.  Tyke's family was in a pretty nice, and quite large by European standards, car that could go fast if they wanted to but they never felt it prudent to do so.  But everyone else would pass them when they were going about 80 in a "70" zone.  No cops are out patrolling really but there is supposed to be video surveillance that catches people.  But anyway, in France the drive to Normandy wasn't much fun but it didn't totally blow.  The land was nice and there were some really big and neat bridges they crossed.  The chateau they stayed in Tyke really didn't like but it was only for a night and it was still a chateau so that was at least a little cool.  Then they drove to Paris after visiting beaches and the American Cemetery.  This drive took wayyyyy longer than expected as they had to skirt the edges of Paris so as to avoid incredibly difficult traffic that they probably couldn't handle.  They finally made it to Charles de Gaulle Airport which is just outside of Paris really and they dropped off the rental car.  Then they had to find the trains to get into the city.  And they weren't sure where the train was stopping as it wasn't hitting every stop on the map.  Making this harder was that everything was written mainly in French so they didn't know what they were reading.  Finally they got to a station where they realized it would probably be smarter to take a cab to their hotel.  And then they couldn't get a taxi for a while.  Finally they got one who could take everyone at once and they made their way to the hotel.  They tipped the taxi driver quite a bit but they didn't care.  They were glad to be at their destination.  The room was on the top floor but was smoking hot inside.  They got two fans to cool the place down and that helped but it was still hot.  They were in a good location though which helped for trips around the city.  The subway there is really easy to use.  Tyke mastered it quickly.  Even though it was in French Tyke could read everything fine.  He learned a few French words that he now knows but not enough to live there for more than 3 days.  Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Arc d'Triomphe, everything was really cool.  Paris was the best city.  Clean and not too big like London was.  It was easy to get to everywhere and it had beautiful architecture everywhere.  Tyke really enjoyed Paris.  You should all get there sometime.  But Tyke did leave Paris for London Saturday night and then slept there for one night.  Then he got up this morning and went to Heathrow Airport.  The 9 hour flight was not that bad.  Tyke wasn't ever tired unfortunately so he didn't get a wink of sleep the entire time.  Also, the volume control on his headphones didn't work for the in-flight movies and stuff so he couldn't watch the movies.  However, the first movie was Starsky and Hutch again while that was followed by Lethal Weapon and then Calendar Girls.  Tyke just put his MP3 player on and listened to music the whole time while watching the movies at the same time.  He finished reading his third book of the trip, Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris.  It's a funny collection of personal essays.  The first essay of part two was probably the best one and Tyke also read it while in Paris which made it funnier cuz the action takes place in Paris too.  But you might enjoy it so pick it up.  Tyke hasn't really read much of Deception Point, another Dan Brown book but he did read of course Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.  Both were good tales.  And Tyke actually read them and did it quickly which was quite shocking to his mother.  But after the 9 hours somehow passed on the long flight, Tyke got to Vancouver, B.C. and waited around to get on his next flight to Sea-Tac.  This flight was a small plane that seated 33 people today.  It had propellers and in order to get on and off they had to walk down onto the tarmac and step directly on the plane.  It was like Tyke was either the President or a member of the Olympic team returning with a gold medal to the land of his adoring fans.  Needless to say, Tyke felt honored to be able to go through such an event.  And then they got in their "limo" (a Town Car really) and watched as they were driven home.  Then Tyke came home, looked at messages he got (thanks for em), and then unpacked and showered.  He is ready for tomorrow to begin though.  A new day and a new life.  Summer now begins for Tyke...college is not far off though.  Folks, Tyke is just so excited to be home now.  This is great.

      Today Tyke actually went out and did stuff.&nbsp; He cleaned the downstairs a little bit because his parents are having a brunch in the morning on Sunday so he was forced to clean up.&nbsp; But it isn't a bad thing cuz it means that the place will look nice until the next time Tyke's friends come over and they trash the place.&nbsp; So it will probably look good for about 7 hours.&nbsp; After cleaning Tyke went over to Amed's house and he took the van cuz his car was taken to get new pretty tires.&nbsp; Now he will actually have front tires that grip.&nbsp; That's always a good thing.&nbsp; When Tyke got to Amed's they were joined by K-caj and they went down to Seattle for the Bite of Seattle.&nbsp; On the drive over Amed told a nice little story that took up most of the ride and ended up being a solid reference for jokes later on as well.&nbsp; It certainly livened the day.&nbsp; The actual Seattle biting wasn't super fun but it was nice to just walk and talk and get some eats.&nbsp; Tyke got a Philly cheese steak and a really good/big elephant ear.&nbsp; But he actually didn't buy anything else.&nbsp; Lots of free samples but really it was just like being in Costco, without the tasty food.&nbsp; But Tyke is pretty bored of this blog.&nbsp; After the bite, the three went to K-caj's new house on Mercer Island.&nbsp; It's tight.&nbsp; It's bigger than Tyke's house and it's newer too which is neat considering Tyke's house is only 2 years old.&nbsp; It is just a cool house.&nbsp; But new houses are always cool.&nbsp; Especially when they are pretty much empty.&nbsp; They seem so much cooler then.&nbsp; Cuz you always imagine what could go in certain spots and do all of that, "whoaaaa, that would be soooo coooool."&nbsp; They watched Kill Bill Vol. 1 after finally figuring out how to get the sound to work.&nbsp; Then they played Bop-It for a while and then went outside to play badminton in the driveway.&nbsp; Tyke was the second best because K-caj always gets either a weird smash or a soft shot to fall and break Tyke's rallies.&nbsp; But Tyke beat Amed consistently.&nbsp; They played that for a long time and got realllly sweaty before going to 7-11 and then to play poker at Kinker's house.&nbsp; Well Amed was gay and he didn't but Tyke and K-caj did.&nbsp; They played some poker and then K-caj left so Tyke was up a bunch and then he played 31 for the remaining 5 bucks of Kinker's money.&nbsp; Tyke actually won.&nbsp; So he won 10 from Kinker and that was cool.&nbsp; Then he left, came home, got bored of writing, and finished.&nbsp; But he still should clean up some more now cuz he's gonna have to do it early in the morning otherwise.&nbsp; Stupid parents, always having friends over...

      Tyke's a bit earlier with this blog tonight.&nbsp; Not much but a little.&nbsp; That's of course because he didn't do a superlot at night.&nbsp; During the day he got up, did nothing for a while, then played the piano for a while cuz it's fun.&nbsp; Then he watered some plants in the blistering heat.&nbsp; Or at least the hotness that was outside.&nbsp; Tyke just started to wonder when the last time there was an entire day when nobody other than Tyke went to Tyke's website.&nbsp; Could be a while...or it could be today.&nbsp; Who really knows?&nbsp; Not a soul.&nbsp; Except maybe Al Gore, cuz he invented the internet.&nbsp; Speaking of Al Gore, Tyke has watched I Love the 90s on VH1 like 10-15 times this past week.&nbsp; It's on all the time so he just tunes in and lets it play while he either watches it or does something else downstairs.&nbsp; Either way it's still on.&nbsp; Tyke got a call from Macaroon during the day and they were joined by Dr. Phil at Tyke's house in the afternoon.&nbsp; They played some cards (not poker though) and then a game of Risk where Macaroon definitely got "touched" by Dr. Phil.&nbsp; Definitely.&nbsp; But Tyke lost too so in the end the Asians managed to rule the world.&nbsp; Tonight involved a great dinner at Subway.&nbsp; It sure did taste great.&nbsp; When Dr. Phil left for his 5 hour work shift (almost typed shit instead, that woulda been funny) Tyke and Macaroon went to the tent sale at GI Joes for about 3 minutes before departing to their separate homes.&nbsp; Tyke watched a few programs on the tele before meeting up with Macaroon and then going over to the house that Tyke played poker at on Wednesday.&nbsp; K-caj and his friend played again.&nbsp; Tyke didn't have any luck today though.&nbsp; He lost 15 and even when he got a decent hand he wouldn't win it.&nbsp; He won some pots but not ones that mattered that much.&nbsp; Macaroon however was catching great cards and had great hole cards.&nbsp; So he ended up winning quite a bit.&nbsp; But Tyke ate a donut before he left and that tasted good.&nbsp; Then he took the supposedly sick Macaroon and came home.&nbsp; Then he wrote another email to Kinker and put on some more Dashboard Confessional.&nbsp; He's had another DC rebirth.&nbsp; Listening to lots of songs.&nbsp; It's just so cool.&nbsp; Maybe Tyke will actually turn his computer off tonight.&nbsp; He hasn't since he got back from Europe.&nbsp; That's almost 2 weeks.&nbsp; Hmmm...it could be time.

      Nope, Tyke left you last with the possibility of Tyke getting 205 once again when he went bowling.&nbsp; He didn't this time though.&nbsp; Way before that though Tyke woke up to his alarm at 10:30 and then realized he didn't want to get up so he just went back to sleep and got up at about 12:20.&nbsp; Then he DLed some music and listened to it and then he worked out and did crunches and worked up a sweat.&nbsp; So he decided to cool down by playing the piano.&nbsp; The only song he really plays right now is Variations on the Canon.&nbsp; Pachelbel's Canon or Canon in D would be other names for the song.&nbsp; But it's just real quality classical music that Tyke loves.&nbsp; However, it isn't a very easy song to play.&nbsp; In fact Tyke can only play like the first sheet of the entire sheet music.&nbsp; And even that he doesn't play it 100% correctly.&nbsp; He doesn't play all the chords really.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he's getting good at actually playing what he can for now.&nbsp; When Tyke went out to get his mail he saw his checks finally came.&nbsp; Of course there was a mistake in them though.&nbsp; The city of Sammamish is spelled Sammanish.&nbsp; The checks still got to him, mainly cuz the zip code was still correct but his mom thinks that he still should get the error corrected.&nbsp; Tyke doesn't want to have to wait again but maybe he should.&nbsp; He got 150 checks and he certainly won't use those up for at least a year.&nbsp; How often will Tyke really write checks?&nbsp; Not that often.&nbsp; Tyke had fajitas for dinner tonight.&nbsp; His chewing continues to improve but it still isn't back to normal.&nbsp; He can eat pretty much anything he wants though which is a great improvement over his past diet which consisted entirely of mushy food.&nbsp; Tyke did have a Wild Berry Ensure this morning though.&nbsp; He wanted chocolate but his mom got wild berry.&nbsp; Lo and behold, it tasted like chocolate anyway.&nbsp; So that was kinda weird but it tasted good so Tyke didn't care.&nbsp; Time passed though and Tyke went out with the guys...again.&nbsp; Macaroon got back in town so he joined the bowling brigade.&nbsp; Tyke, Kinker, Maniak, Macaroon, K-caj.&nbsp; Tyke struggled the first game.&nbsp; The second game he got better but still not very good.&nbsp; The second game for Kinker though...that was a good game.&nbsp; He ended up 3 short of 200 but still put in a respectable 197.&nbsp; Can't beat Tyke's record of  205  but it certainly upped Kinker's old record of  165 .&nbsp; Italics...neat.&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.tykeandskippy.blogspot.com &nbsp; That's neat too.&nbsp; Tyke's fourth game ended up being pretty quality.&nbsp; He got tired during it but still managed to knock down 187 of those little white bastards.&nbsp; He got 4 strikes in a row too which is always nice.&nbsp; Nothing like a turkey+1.&nbsp; Then Tyke drove Kinker and Macaroon to JIB for caramel shakes and onward to the Macaroon house where they all went home.&nbsp; Friday could be a boring day.&nbsp; Maybe a boring night too.&nbsp; Tyke is hoping that he can hang out with a certain someone but most likely it won't happen.&nbsp; Always a chance.

      Waking up before 8 on a Wednesday morning has always been hard this year, but doing it in the summer when he went to bed at 2 made this time a lot harder for Tyke.  It wasn't that bad though.  It's only sleep.  He went and got his stitches out.  The dentist had a pretty hard time getting the first set out but after a lot of persistence, and some pinching of Tyke's gums, he finally got them out.  Then he got the other 3 easily.  There was some bleeding for about 15 minutes afterwards but that stopped and now Tyke's mouth is hopefully like it will be for the rest of his life.  That's a bit of a weird thought.  No more change in Tyke's mouth for like 70 years.  Well, maybe he won't have all his teeth then, but hopefully.  After the removal of sutures, Tyke sat in the van and listened to music as his mom was getting a teeth cleaning at the same time.  Then they went to Starbucks and Tyke got his fav drink and then they went to Linens'n'Things for some dorm shopping.  Tyke got his comforter and bed sheets for his bed at The Washington State University this fall, or as Tyke is now going to call it TWSU or TWazzu.  Then Tyke went home and took it easy for a little while.  K-caj called him up and he came over for about 40 minutes.  They played shithead and 13/Big 2(why Big 2?).  It was pretty fun.  A nice break from the normal daytime routine.  Then Tyke played some piano (Pachelbel's Canon in D to be more specific).  That is just a splendid (second time usage today) song when played on the piano, especially when it is in person.  Tyke also laid out in the sun for a little while and it felt pretty good.  Then he just watched a little Family Guy.  At night Tyke had an enchilada for dinner and then fruit snacks and Nature Valley bars.  It feels pretty good now when Tyke eats now that the stitches are gone.  It does make a difference.  The areas that were cut open are still a little tender but they don't hurt or make that weird feeling when you bite aluminum foil on a filling anymore.  So that's good.  Then Kinker called Tyke (on his house phone which is funny cuz earlier in the day Tyke told K-caj how he hasn't gotten a call on his home phone in a while since it is usually just Macaroon who ever calls the house) and they set up a get-together at Kinker's house.  Tyke went there and K-caj and his friend were already there.  They played some shithead and 13 before heading up to Skippy's old neighborhood to his old neighbor's house for some poker.  Tyke knew exactly where he was going and actually knew the kid too.  They used to play baseball together back in AAA when Kinker was on the same team as well.  That was when Tyke got Nate McMillan's autograph on his baseball hat before a game down at Lakemont Park.  That was a good day.  But there were a couple of other guys playing too.  It was a good day for Tyke it turned out.  He picked a good seat indeed.  He won some early hands and then got chipped away but he was consistently either chip leader or in the top two or three.  He ended up winning like 37 or so meaning he gained a total of 27 with the 10 dollar buy-ins.  It was a good, fun night as Tyke caught some nice cards.  Not nearly as much as K-caj's friend though.  He got like 4 or 5 full houses and caught at least one on the river.  It was freaky.  Tyke got talked to a bunch by the father of the house because he was friendly and remembered Tyke and liked him and of course liked Tyke's dad.  Every baseball coach has liked Tyke's dad it seems.  After collecting his winnings and saying goodbye, Tyke drove Kinker home and then came home himself.  No real plans tomorrow but Tyke would like to go bowling at Hillcrest Bowl cuz Tyke believes it is Quartermania meaning it only costs 25 cents a game from 9-12.  That's definitely a good thing.  But last time Tyke couldn't get anybody who wanted to come so it fizzled.  Tyke already tried with his go-to girl but she is busy so he'll have to expand out his search.  But bowling is wicked fun.  Don't worry though, Tyke probably won't get another 205...or will he???

      Today and yesterday sure did have a lot of similarities for Tyke.  Today he got up late and did nothing all day other than lay out in the sun for a while and try his best to eat some stuff.  He did get a call from Tina though in the early evening.  They chatted for a couple of minutes and then decided that they wouldn't be able to hang out until next Monday at the earliest.  So they still don't have definite plans but they do both want to see each other.  They haven't even seen each other once this whole summer!  Yeah, that's not any different than any other summer but this is a different summer.  And they have a different relationship now anyway.  But aside from that conversation Tyke spent his day just with himself and his mom at home doing work.  He watched the All-Star game later on and then he and Kinker set up a hangout.  Kinker came over and they started by playing some 2 person Risk.  Tyke won easily because they played Capitals and Tyke got both Asia and Europe so he got 19 armies to start and he easily was able to get to Kinker's capital.  Once they were about to start a second game good old Amed strolled on in.  So they bagged that for a new game with all 3.  This time it was much different.  Amed and Tyke were both stuck next to each other in North America.  They had some struggles to hold on to territories but eventually Tyke made the smart move to retreat out of his capital and into his stronghold in Kamchatka on the other side of the world.  There he sat while he took over Africa with the last remaining armies he had.  Then he just sat in Kamchatka until Amed had to leave because of his inability to close a garage door and Dr. Phil came over at the same time.  They decided to bag the game with Amed getting last place and Kinker winning.  Then they played 31, for real money.  They each bought in 5 bucks and then made 10 stacks.  They ended up playing for an hour and 40 minutes.  Tyke lost once and bought back in.  Then he became very powerful and got close to taking out Kinker when he lost power.  Dr. Phil ended up being strong again and then Kinker went out and 2 hands later so did Tyke.  So Dr. Phil won 15 there.  Then they played "best out of 3" hold'em.  And of course Dr. Phil came from behind to win 2 in a row and take that series.  So then they played Shithead and Tyke finally won!  He won all 3 games they played.  Even if there is only a loser (shithead) Tyke still won all 3 games.  It was satisfying.  So now Tyke has to get up before 8 in the morning and go get his stitches out.  Yay for Tyke!

      This was a fun night.  Even if it did start late, the gang made up for it by playing late.  Like past 1 AM.  Later than normal for a Tyke-house night.  But there was a bit of action before that.  During the day it was great cuz it was actually warm and sunny out.  In the low 80s in fact.  So Tyke went out on his deck and got some nice sun on his pasty white body.  Not much difference can be noticed but Tyke is gonna at least get some color to his skin before the week is over.  He isn't a big fan of getting burned though so he doesn't stay out in the sun for that long.  Other than that though Tyke just listened to music and watched tv while he tried to find things he could eat without hurting his semi-swollen mouth.  He will be getting his stitches out on Wednesday though which he hopes will mean that by Thursday he should feel totally fine again.  But he doesn't fully expect that to happen.  At night he watched the home run derby which was fun and then the celebrity/legends softball game.  That was funny.  Rollie Fingers made an insane diving catch to rob a hit.  If you know who Rollie Fingers is and when he played then you should at least chuckle at that line.  Tyke and Dr. Phil set some preliminary plans for the night and then later on they changed them to a later time but they still hung out.  Joining them was Kinker and Amed.  First off they played Risk.  Tyke won again!  This time he just rampaged through the world by having all of North America the entire time and not having to fight any wars other than the little African "feud" that Tyke and Dr. Phil had going in order to help themselves out.  But it turned out to help Tyke more than anyone as it won the game for him by assuring a card every turn which Tyke later turned in to win the game.  It was a solid pounding Tyke put on everyone.  Amed struggled pretty badly from the beginning when he made a hooooge oversight and didn't notice that he left his capital wide open to attack and thus Kinker took him over right away.  So he was done.  He stayed around and was put into Tyke's army but only like people get knighted by the English government.  It was all title, no perks.  Whatever, he was a happy Russian.  After Tyke's victory came poker.  They played $10 buy-ins and it was a good thing to do it turned out.  Mr. Amed once again found out tonight.  He just struggled.  He ended up losing 40 in the 10 buck buy-ins.  Tyke went up 10, Kinker went up 10, and Dr. Phil went up 20 when they decided to cash out and then play $5 games to keep Amed around.  So Amed then stayed.  And he lost that one.  Tyke stayed even (he gained a buck but then lost it on later gambling), Kinker won 5, and Dr. Phil lost one.  For the aforementioned dollar Tyke played Kinker (Dr. Phil's replacement while he learned the rules) in 31.  This is a really fun game.  It is pretty easy to explain and understand but he's not gonna waste his time doing it here.   Tyke won the dollar from Dr. Phil after playing for a while.  Then Tyke and Kinker decided to play once again for another dollar.  And after a really long time Tyke lost.  There was probably about an hour of 31 playing tonight when all was said and done.  That's cool.  A new game to play now actually.  Hopefully it doesn't go the way of Chinko.  It could but this one you can at least bet on so it is made more interesting by that factor.  And it isn't so weird and pointless either.  But Chinko isn't a terrible game either.  Oh crap!  Tyke can't remember exactly what Amed said tonight that was blogworthy.  It was something along the lines of "I don't expect to ever win" or something like that.  Basically he said, "I'm Amed and I suck at poker and Risk unless I get lucky."  That was basically it.  Basically.

      This sure was a close call.  Tyke almost went off to bed without even blogging!  That would have been quite a blunder.  Every time Tyke could, he has blogged and that streak has been going for months.  This would have been a stupid way to break it.  By simply forgetting.  Well today had a little more action in it than yesterday.  But not that much still.  Tyke got up to the nice sun and then a little later got a nice burst of energy.  Maybe it was from the donut he cut up and slowly chewed for 5 minutes before finally finishing it off.  The whole mouth thing is getting annoying now.  Sure, Tyke has had it really easy with the operation and post-op health but he still really wants to be able to chew and he still can't other than with his front teeth.  So he ate the donut like a gopher or rabbit or something but it still tasted wonderfully.  Later on he went downstairs and saw that the sheets on his bed really needed to be changed.  So he did that and then noticed that the floor was messy so he vacuumed the downstairs.  He did it quickly and it wasn't a great job but it still was good enough.  At least it doesn't look like it's dirty.  It still probably is but if it doesn't look it then nobody cares.  Then he just sat and watched tv for hours.  At dinner time he popped a fettucine alfredo in the microwave and took his time eating that.  Then he got called by Naan/Footsies and they invited him to dinner at Thai Ginger.  He was up for it even though he couldn't eat/already did.  There was Purdy, Ekul, Naan, Footsies, Red Sox/Kalia (did Tyke name her Red Sox first? he can't remember), and Christmas Carol.  It was a good dinner.  Tyke drank a lot of water and that was it but he chatted it up with Ekul and Naan and Purdy and Footsies.  So it was quite enjoyable.  Then he went home and got kinda tired so he ended up not doing anything.  He did play 2 hours of Empire Poker with Kinker though.  That was pretty fun for a while.  Then Tyke got up to leave but realized he hadn't blogged so he came back and did that.  It really was a close one.  But Nene was also online tonight so they talked for a little and they are going to hang out sometime soon now that she is back.  Maybe he'll visit her at work tomorrow.  Except he doesn't know when she works so maybe not.  And she doesn't want him to so there's another reason not to.  Yeah, well time for Tyke to actually go to sleep.  Hmmm...he's getting hungry now.  Maybe he'll sneak a snack from...ah crap he can't eat anything really.  Grrr...  EDIT: It's funny how things work out, isn't it?  Tyke almost forgot to blog tonight and now he is doing a second blog in the same night.  But Tyke can't sleep so he needed something to calm his mind and hopefully ease his troubled mind.  And he didn't really feel like taking Vicodin to do so.  But then he wrote out a long blog and thought that it was too personal and revealing so he shouldn't share it.  Sorry if you were looking forward to reading something interesting from Tyke but he knows he can't be too forward on here.  It isn't anonymous and problems can arise from what Tyke says.  He certainly doesn't want to make his current situation any worse than it is so he is going to have to just tell you that the reason he can't sleep tonight is because of love.  His mind is racing with what-ifs and self-doubt and other hopes and dreams that Tyke knows can't come true for him.  It is a tough idea to cope with and Tyke might not truly cope with it.  He might just end up forgetting about it but he thinks that if he were to be face to face with his "problem" in 10 years, he would remember exactly how he felt for this past year.  It's just one of those things.

      Hours and hours have been spent being bored and annoyed but they are all coming to a close now.&nbsp; It never used to be like this either.&nbsp; For some reason though, it's getting to be a bit annoying.&nbsp; In the morning Tyke was awakened multiple times by his grandma getting up as well as her dog barking, whining, breathing, and licking.&nbsp; Tyke didn't even get that great of a sleep last night on the couch.&nbsp; Usually he does cuz it's a really nice couch but he tossed and turned for quite a while.&nbsp; After getting up he looked at the clock and somehow it was already 1 PM.&nbsp; So he got some joking words from all the family which was a little annoying but hey, he did sleep later than everyone else.&nbsp; He got some more presents in the morning which was cool and then he watered a bunch of plants.&nbsp; It was hot out again but Tyke still liked it.&nbsp; Some of the family was gone at Ikea but Tyke and the younger cousin played some PS2 and remarkably Tyke got his ass kicked.&nbsp; He had no idea he was getting played by the little bastard.&nbsp; Then they decided to go to Blockbuster so Tyke drove them over there and they got a couple games.&nbsp; Back at home they didn't really do anything but Tyke got annoyed once again.&nbsp; It is pretty annoying that his grandmother is one of the most stubborn and closed-minded people Tyke knows.&nbsp; She just kept on bashing the music Tyke listens to and she doesn't even have an idea what he listens to.&nbsp; So he said that he listens to some classical, which is true, and then she said the songs he likes aren't really that good anyway.&nbsp; It's like, come on, just cuz Tyke doesn't listen to every single song and band you like, it doesn't mean he has terrible taste in music.&nbsp; So Tyke then just wouldn't tell her any of the other types of music he listens to because she was just going to bash that too.&nbsp; Tyke then decided he would go back to playing video games.&nbsp; All of the family but the 3 "kids" went to a Diana Krall concert at night so Tyke was left to watch the cousins and the dog.&nbsp; Once again, Tyke's grandma made some comments that alluded to Tyke's irresponsibility or at least the irresponsibility of every single teenager alive.&nbsp; Yet again Tyke tried to ignore that.&nbsp; She seems to have been a little bit more pessimistic this visit.&nbsp; Not sure why.&nbsp; Right now her dog is eating his left paw and his fur along with licking the carpet.&nbsp; And it's a little annoying.&nbsp; So Tyke is staring it down now.&nbsp; Yep, Tyke just won that staring contest.&nbsp; When everyone was gone Tyke and the cuzzes played PS2 and then took the dog on a walk.&nbsp; That was pleasant.&nbsp; Then they went and picked up a pizza and brought it back home and ate it.&nbsp; It tasted really good.&nbsp; Then they played some PS2 and then watched National Lampoon's Vacation until everybody got back.&nbsp; The problem with his cousins is that they never make up their mind.&nbsp; They say "I don't care" or "I don't know" to everything.&nbsp; And Tyke is supposed to be some super adult around them too so he can't play poker with them or anything like that.&nbsp; He probably shouldn't have even shown the movie he showed cuz it has nudity and swearing.&nbsp; Tyke is just glad he doesn't live that way.&nbsp; Tyke's parents are totally wickedly cool compared to the rest of his family.&nbsp; But Tyke just has to go to bed tonight, wake up tomorrow and then they will be gone shortly thereafter.&nbsp; It just isn't like it used to be.&nbsp; It used to be a lot of fun but now it's just a hassle.&nbsp; Oh well, Tyke's growing up to the point where there won't be very many get togethers anymore.

      Today wasn't all that much fun.&nbsp; Got up super early, 10:30, and had to clean stuff up and wash stuff and it was not much fun.&nbsp; Then at about noon Tyke's grandma arrived but his mom was gone so he had to do a bunch of other things while she was there.&nbsp; Basically the rest of the day wasn't fun except for when Tyke went outside and sunned for about half an hour.&nbsp; It was really nice.&nbsp; Once he started sweating he felt really cool and there was a bit of a breeze so it was really nice.&nbsp; There's two straight sentences ending with it was really nice.&nbsp; Make it 3.&nbsp; It was coincidental though.&nbsp; After his sun experience he took a shower and when he got back upstairs more family had arrived so he chatted a bit but then had to get ice.&nbsp; Then he got back and had to go to Costco with his brother.&nbsp; Then he came home and was done for a while but later on he had to get more ice.&nbsp; These errands though were the best part of the day cuz he got to get out and listen to music loud with the wind in his hair (or A/C) and just let loose.&nbsp; The party was fun though.&nbsp; Two family friends (which are basically family) and Tyke's dad's brother and wife came over.&nbsp; So Tyke got some more presents (read: money) and it was great to just catch up.&nbsp; Tyke and Bob Barker Kabuki (BBK) who Tyke talked about last night got to talk again.&nbsp; They both go off to college in less than a month so they'll try to fit in a hang out sometime before that.&nbsp; After the party Tyke just sat and had a beer.&nbsp; Or he tried one.&nbsp; Didn't like it.&nbsp; Was gonna have a Corona earlier but forgot so he settled for some other crap and he didn't like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Never has Tyke been a big beer fan.&nbsp; He doesn't like the smell, taste, or anything about it other than carrying it around in a bottle.&nbsp; For some reason that makes Tyke feel important.&nbsp; Tyke just changed the title of his blog because he realized this blog sucks.&nbsp; So he better go to bed now which means that he has to turn around and walk 4 feet cuz he's sleeping on the couch while his grandma is in his room.&nbsp; And to make things worse her dog smells like shit and has stanked up the whole downstairs.&nbsp; Not to mention the intense shedding this dog is going through.&nbsp; Tyke hasn't seen this much hair since his cousins got here (and boy do they have a lot of hair on their heads).&nbsp; Then again, one of them has been approached multiple times to model so looks like Tyke shouldn't be talking bad.&nbsp; One more day then Tyke can go back to his normalcy.&nbsp; Getting up at 2 and not doing anything all day.&nbsp; Ahhh, that's the life.

      Another day, another day of poker.&nbsp; You should be proud of Tyke though for today he got up at noon!!!&nbsp; Not 1, not 2.&nbsp; NOON!!!&nbsp; Only got 8 hours of sleep too.&nbsp; That was a bitch!&nbsp; Today's day included Tyke going to Children's Hospital where he felt like either a mutant, a retard, or just old.&nbsp; He was taller than almost every single person he saw in the hospital.&nbsp; That includes patients and staff.&nbsp; When he was there he went through a few check-ins and he noticed he got a couple odd glances from people wondering why he was there since he looked old enough to be bringing a kid of his own in.&nbsp; But nope, just Tyke himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some coloring stations and some cartoons playing but Tyke decided to play with his phone instead.&nbsp; The actual appointment was a breeze.&nbsp; Tyke took off his shirt, got felt up, was asked if he was cold, said no, and then was told he was fine.&nbsp; So the diagnosis was that Tyke doesn't need to go back to see the doc again and that he really shouldn't have any problems with this thingy.&nbsp; His breastbone is just tilted on one side making for the odd appearance but really it isn't that odd.&nbsp; It just looks like his left pec is stronger.&nbsp; It isn't but it looks like it.&nbsp; After Tyke drove on home he did some mom-helping things and then proceeded to spend the rest of the day playing the piano, lifting weights, and washing the windows outside the rec-room for no apparent reason.&nbsp; But now they look good so that is a bonus.&nbsp; And then Tyke and Kinker got MSwa to help set up a game at Bondage's house.&nbsp; Interesting way that arose you could say.&nbsp; Kinker asked Tyke if he wanted to play poker and then they asked MSwa and then he called Bondage and then he said they could play at his house and then they said that was cool and then Tyke called Macaroon and then he said he'd play and then Tyke picked up Kinker and then they picked up Macaroon and then afterwards Tyke drove home Macaroon and Jew but not Kinker cuz he was off getting someone out of a ditch which really wasn't a ditch and then Tyke took home Macaroon and then he took home Jew and then he came home and then he...exhaled.&nbsp; Now it's just time to take it easy.&nbsp; Tyke has to get up at 10:30 tomorrow cuz he has his family coming over somewhat early and then apparently he has a party at night.&nbsp; But he started talking online to a really longtime friend of his which was really cool.&nbsp; And she's coming to his "party" Friday night.&nbsp; Just a graduation/send-off thing with family and family friends.&nbsp; And Saturday Tyke is also busy and at night he has to take care of his two cousins sorta since all the other adults will be gone.&nbsp; Oh yeah, Tyke just remembered he was gonna say that there were babies galore at Children's Hospital, like you would expect.&nbsp; Purdy would have been in heaven.&nbsp; But yeah, Tyke's weekend will be a little bit of a drag so hopefully it ends up being fun.&nbsp; Then next week Tyke has his orientation at WSU which will mean he finally gets his schedule and such.&nbsp; That will be nice to figure out.&nbsp; And then soon his laptop will come and that is also great.&nbsp; For now Tyke is going to focus on the now and the next to now.

      So what happened today you ask?&nbsp; Well first off Tyke got up at 1:20.&nbsp; Fell asleep about 3:40 AM and got up at 1:20 PM.&nbsp; That was a bit of a waste of the day but that's ok.&nbsp; His mom was home for the day so he ended up not being able to do much cuz he had to help her out some.&nbsp; He looked at a bunch of printers and multifunction printers and helped to make the decision that he is not going to buy a printer with his laptop.&nbsp; Instead, he will either take the one the family is using primarily right now (which is a good one) and his family will just upgrade to a printer/scanner/copier/fax machine, or he will buy one through a different company and it will be good but not that expensive.&nbsp; This took up most of the day.&nbsp; The rest of the time he was playing the piano, lifting weights, or eating.&nbsp; He didn't watch any tv until the Mariners game at night.&nbsp; In the early evening he and his mom went down to Kostko (Kinker should get it) and they looked at printers and some food items.&nbsp; Tyke thought about it and realized that Skippy might very well be working there at the moment so he walked around and sure enough the man was there.&nbsp; So they chatted for a minute and found out what they were up to and when they could hang out.&nbsp; Probably won't be for a while still but at least it is known now.&nbsp; After getting home Tyke put some more pressure on his parents to finally make their final inputs on his new laptop and they caved enough to help him out.&nbsp; So he told them what he wanted and all of that and they said what they thought was best and really didn't care at all what he was getting.&nbsp; The cost went up and up and nothing seemed to matter.&nbsp; When all was said and done it cost $2,139.21 (50 cent deduction on shipping!!!) and it will be really cool when it gets here.&nbsp; However, that isn't until like 2 weeks from now.&nbsp; That sucks.&nbsp; Tyke is excited for it but he is definitely not excited for 2 weeks to be over.&nbsp; That would mean he has less than 2 weeks left of summer which isn't a great thought at the moment.&nbsp; But really, the laptop's gonna be tight.&nbsp; Tyke even splurged and bought a $20 game.&nbsp; Hehe, it's a bunch of poker and card games.&nbsp; It better have Hold'Em though or else it will suck.&nbsp; But it's the 2004 version and Hold'Em is the game of 2004.&nbsp; No doubt.&nbsp; And Tyke is also the man of 2004.&nbsp; He just polled his downstairs and he was the hands down, unanimous decision.&nbsp; After Tyke's long time spent searching everything and it's mother on the laptop situation he came back downstairs and talked to Kinker.&nbsp; He decided what they were going to do tonight.&nbsp; Kinker came over and the two hung out.&nbsp; Just played cards really.&nbsp; Tyke taught Kinker 3 new games though and Kinker refreshed Tyke on Rummy which they had some dissension about but it all ended up coming out square.&nbsp; It was fun cuz after cards were over they talked about their childhoods and how cool they used to be.&nbsp; Tyke and Kinker are the new Tyke and Skippy.&nbsp; That may be harsh, but it's totally true.&nbsp; Especially cuz Tyke and Kinker are going to college together and have similar (sorta but not really) interests.&nbsp; And they have a mutual friend made already.&nbsp; Sure, Tyke hasn't ever met her but they've talked, through Kinker.&nbsp; And Tyke's gonna drive Kinker out to Marysville and they're gonna hang out with her.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; It's true.&nbsp; Well now Tyke is going to say that there isn't more to say about today.&nbsp; Tomorrow Tyke will be going to Children's Hospital (as a 17 year old) in order to get his deformed chest looked at again (by the way if you didn't know Tyke does actually have a deformed chest).&nbsp; So maybe he'll go do some more crunches to make himself look good for all of the babies and 2 year olds there ;).&nbsp; Oh wait, that's gross.

      Today started off poorly of course.&nbsp; Since last night's night extended pretty far into Tuesday's day Tyke will blog about what he did after he blogged.&nbsp; He was realllllly not in the mood to go to sleep so he didn't.&nbsp; He just sat at the computer and did nothing.&nbsp; But then he talked to Kinker for ummm a long time.&nbsp; Until after 3 AM.&nbsp; They didn't really talk about much at all but it was still for a good 2+ hours.&nbsp; Tyke ate some food and realized that eased sadness for a little while, at least until the food ran out.&nbsp; Then he sat there again doing nothing but an occasional message to Kink.&nbsp; It ended up being alright but then Tyke realized he should really go to bed.&nbsp; He wasn't the least bit tired though.&nbsp; Not even yawning at all.&nbsp; So he went to his bathroom and took a vicodin cuz that makes him feel good and sleep as well.&nbsp; It worked pretty well he thinks.&nbsp; Hopefully he doesn't become addicted though, that would be malnutritious.&nbsp; Well he went to sleep and was awaken to Macaroon's phone call at noon saying he was free at night.&nbsp; So Tyke said cool basically and that was that.&nbsp; Then Tyke was awake so he drained the MW (that doesn't mean jerking off if you thought it did) and decided he was just going to go back into bed.&nbsp; He turned on Not Another Teen Movie on ComCent and then just watched that until 2 PM.&nbsp; So by this point it was already the afternoon and he had been out of bed for about&nbsp;5 minutes.&nbsp; But he finally got out and took a shower.&nbsp; Nothing really changed so he went upstairs and tried to find something fun to do but he couldn't.&nbsp; So he played the piano and lifted weights.&nbsp; He did a lot of curls and wrist rolls today, along with the usual crunches.&nbsp; Being bored/sad at least makes him want to work out which is a good thing.&nbsp; The day was pretty uneventful which is how they are shaping up for the most part this summer.&nbsp; By the way Tyke's summer is super short this year.&nbsp; Shortest ever.&nbsp; Tyke has apparently been blogging for 47 minutes but really he has just had this window open that long.&nbsp; But Tyke has been explaining a dream he had last night which was totally awesome but terrible to wake up to.&nbsp; Tyke probably shouldn't go into the details of the dream but now he realizes that it might not be so bad.&nbsp; It was a really good dream.&nbsp; Probably wouldn't be that funny but maybe Tyke would tell it funny.&nbsp; Hmmm...Tyke's gonna ask Kinker if he should tell it.&nbsp; Well, here's how Tyke's gonna do it.&nbsp; He of course wants to tell the dream cuz for some reason Tyke loves sharing his personal details to everyone.&nbsp; Well, he'll just do it now.&nbsp; Tyke had ended up in some weird movie theater seated with "a girl" on his right and for some weird reason Jew was on his left but the seats were sort of like a "sectional couch" so Jew wasn't very close but the girl was.&nbsp; There was something blocking the screen from being seen by this girl so she was always leaning over towards Tyke to be able to see.&nbsp; She was fully in front of Tyke's face and he was loving it but he knew she was doing this on purpose.&nbsp; It was weird that Tyke was able to pick up signals from the girl in his dream.&nbsp; But the movie sorta stopped playing and everyone else started just going about their business in the theater so Tyke and the perty girl next to him started flirting somewhat and just talking.&nbsp; They were already really good friends so they had plenty to talk about.&nbsp; They started being more physically flirty and eventually started to do that "walking with your fingers thing" on the other person.&nbsp; The girl started doing it to Tyke and then she got a little more adventurous and meandered down to Tyke's groin and tapped "him."&nbsp; Tyke sorta jumped and laughed.&nbsp; Then they laughed together and referenced these previous times in their friendship where Tyke told her that she touched his penis but she didn't think she did.&nbsp; Tyke used his fingers to crawl up her arm and up her shoulder and then found his way to her bosom and then they laughed again because the girl had told Tyke sometimes he had touched her bosom on accident because of the whole penis touching thing.&nbsp; So they shared some more laughs and then she got up off her knees (sounds bad yeah but it wasn't like that) and leaned in and kissed Tyke on the cheek.&nbsp; She for some reason wasn't on the cream colored "couch" anymore but was kneeling on her knees while Tyke just sat up on the couch leaning forward to talk to her.&nbsp; He wasn't super taken aback by the kiss as it was only on the cheek but he knew that at this point he finally had gotten what he wanted.&nbsp; The two had broken down their barriers and were progressing into something Tyke wanted.&nbsp; They cuddled for the rest of the dream and occasionally she would kiss Tyke on the cheek again but never on the lips, except for a graze once.&nbsp; It wasn't a sensual dream so much as a very emotionally satisfying dream.&nbsp; Tyke finally got what he really wanted from the girl and he felt so at peace with everything.&nbsp; No sex, none of that mumbo jumbo, just talking and flirting.&nbsp; They knew what the other wanted and it was just so special.&nbsp; But Tyke did wake up later from the dream and realized he was still in the same situation as before.&nbsp; It hurt a little for sure.&nbsp; Well that was pretty much the dream.&nbsp; But now Tyke has to talk about the night.&nbsp; Kinker, MSwa, Dr. Phil, and Macaroon came over and played poker.&nbsp; Tyke lost 20 initially but Macaroon owed him 6 so he got his losses down to 14 for the day.&nbsp; Then he played MSwa heads up in 31 and won 5 bucks there.&nbsp; So he was only down 9.&nbsp; But he got even more good news later on.&nbsp; Piggy J im'd Tyke saying that he remembered that he owed Tyke 8 bucks from a lunch Tyke paid for at the end of the school year.&nbsp; So Tyke will be getting 8 more back.&nbsp; He really only lost 1 today then.&nbsp; That's nice to think of.&nbsp; And so is that dream.&nbsp; So now Tyke is going to do that.&nbsp; Too bad Naan and Tyke didn't hang out but he thought she was going to call her tonight.&nbsp; Oh well, sometime soon hopefully.

      These blogs suck.&nbsp; They're so happressing (coined word putting two words together).&nbsp;&nbsp;The day's events were really fun and best in a while.&nbsp; The latter part of the word comes from the fact that the day is over and it will be a really long time til the next one like it.&nbsp; So you most likely want to know what Tyke did, or if you already know what he did, how Tyke went about writing it.&nbsp; The morning and mid-day was spent looking at laptops with his mom and on his own.&nbsp; He hasn't made a completely final decision yet but he is pretty much set on what he's getting.&nbsp; The Dell Inspiron 8600 with quite a few upgrades.&nbsp; It is going to be pretty sick when it finally gets here/is ordered.&nbsp; But that really took up most of the day.&nbsp; It was fun but Tyke really just wants to order the damn thing so he can get it and start using it.&nbsp; It's going to be great!&nbsp; After that Tyke talked with Kinker and Tyronious online and then his dad called so they talked for a little.&nbsp; Tyke then realized he was leaving in less than two hours for the Mariners game so he had to finish up a CD he was working on as well as get some food.&nbsp; So he ate some great Top Ramen and then finished up the CD.&nbsp; After that he got dressed (he wasn't naked before though) and left for Purdy's.&nbsp; He got there and watched a little tv with her family as she ate some jello.&nbsp; They talked about the Mariners and then got on the subject of the tent city where a lot of homeless people are housed temporarily.&nbsp; Quickly departing from that subject Tyke and Purdy took off for the game.&nbsp; It was still really nice out today so the drive over the water was really pretty.&nbsp; Then again, so was the passenger.&nbsp; Tyke found his usual area for parking but this time did an adjacent lot to the norm and ended up not liking this area all that much after all was said and done.&nbsp; But the parking lot guy did give them cracker jacks and said that Purdy was cuter than Tyke.&nbsp; It turned out that Ekul, Haras, and Kramm were all at the game as well but they were in different seats.&nbsp; Ekul came down from the terrace club to say hi to Tyke and Purdy but Haras was never able to find where they were sitting even after they called her and tried to tell her.&nbsp; But Tyke and Purdy saw her.&nbsp; The game was a pretty good one.&nbsp; The M's looked like themselves for most of the time but late in the game they actually played well!&nbsp; And got some help as well.&nbsp; It went into extra innings but not the 18 that Tyke said it would.&nbsp; Purdy would have "slit her wrists" if that happened.&nbsp; It was really superbly awesome to hang out with Purdy throughout the game.&nbsp; There were tons of babies on the screen and going up and down the aisles which made Purdy happy and Tyke enjoyed seeing that.&nbsp; After the game Tyke drove them to Purdy's house where she got her car and then they drove up to Kramm's to join everyone from the game as well as Tig.&nbsp; They just watched Dude Where's My Car? for a little bit and really didn't do all that much.&nbsp; But Tyke got to see Haras for the first time all summer which was great.&nbsp; Hopefully they can hang out soon.&nbsp; Tyke left and came home to sulk on the computer and blog.&nbsp; Another great night but it all ends so unfulfillingly.&nbsp; Empty days and empty nights drone on continuously.&nbsp; There are bright spots and enticing mirages down every road but they all end up fake or busted.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to matter which road Tyke traverses as they all lead to the same path, back to the road he was just on.&nbsp; Tyke is driving down this road with his headlights on searching for some signpost that points him in the right direction or maybe something that tells him how far off he is.&nbsp; Maybe he just needs to stop and ask for directions.&nbsp; Because 7 hours in 7 days doesn't equate to eternal happiness.

      Today was a pretty long and busy day for Tyke.&nbsp; He had to get up at 9:30 in the morning...well, actually that ends up being a lie.&nbsp; He thought he had to get up then and clean the downstairs but it turned out the people weren't coming over until 11:30 for brunch so Tyke could have slept another hour.&nbsp; Instead he just cleaned for a while and then when he was done he watched tv while he wished he was sleeping.&nbsp; Later he took a shower and waited til the people came over.&nbsp; One of the ladies was a really smiley lady.&nbsp; She would just look at Tyke and smile for like 5 seconds.&nbsp; It was quite awkward.&nbsp; Tyke didn't know what to do cuz it wasn't like they were talking or anything.&nbsp; They just happened to be standing near each other.&nbsp; The people stayed for about 3 hours or maybe more or maybe less.&nbsp; After they left Tyke talked with his parents about which laptop he's getting but they still wouldn't help him make his final decision.&nbsp; He is pretty sure he knows what he wants but they keep not being as definitive as him.&nbsp; Basically he needs to push them to just order it.&nbsp; Later on Tyke watched Rat Race on TV and then got called by Kinker to play poker at Bondage's house with MSwa and Jew.&nbsp; Bondage's friend came and he hadn't played poker before so he was&nbsp;an easy 10 bucks.&nbsp; Tyke ended up winning 25 from the pot and now is up 50 this week.&nbsp; Not bad for 4 games.&nbsp; It was quite a hilarious game too.&nbsp; A good crew of guys for this game.&nbsp; And they were all, except for Bondage, good at poker so it was even better that way.&nbsp; It's more fun taking money from somebody who's good than somebody like Amed.&nbsp; Haha, just kidding.&nbsp; Tyke also got called by Naan while he was playing poker and they are gonna get together on Tuesday.&nbsp; And on Monday Tyke and Purdy are going to the Mariners game and hanging out.&nbsp; Tyke is also supposed to get a call from Tina about when they are going to hang out this week so Tyke is already getting his schedule all filled up.&nbsp; It's quite nice in fact.

      Nothing out of the ordinary until later on at night today.  Tyke woke up at about, oh, noon, and after that he went upstairs and his bro was home talking with his mom and then they talked about his trip cross country to D.C. for law school.  He is driving himself all the way across the country and keeping his car there so he has to move everything.  It's going to be interesting.  He leaves on Saturday.  One week from today.  So Tyke is pretty soon going to be even more of an only child, even if he is going to be at Pullman anyway.  That will be quite a trip though.  Driving all the way across the country by himself.  Gotta admire that go-getterness.  After talking about that trip they talked about Tyke's college plans and his schedule.  They looked at possible changes to his schedule like trying to put in Com101 cuz that will be his major but it really doesn't work out.  Tyke should have a pretty easy time though.  But his second semester might be pretty hard.  It will probably be 16 or 17 credits as opposed to 14.  And right now two of the classes Tyke is taking he has pretty much taken before so hopefully that will mean he can really have a high GPA and excel early on cuz it is a cutthroat college of communications he wants to be a part of and to get in he has to be good.  Well after his brother left Tyke played some Hoyle Casino 2004 and he lost a lot of money.  He lost most of it on the horses though.  Damn that Purple Prancer.  Lost Tyke about $8000.  That should have been an omen for the night but Tyke didn't take it as one.  His parents left at 5 something to go to a friends' house for the night so Tyke went to Teriyaki Bistro for dinner and coincidentally ran into Dr. Phil there.  He was with his Cali friends and Amed was there earlier too.  After a little while they got a poker game going at Dr. Phil's house with Amed, the Cali boys, DCups, Macaroon, and Dr. Phil's dad.  It was a pretty damn big pot tonight.  $230 when Tyke left.  Tyke started off getting crap for a long time.  He spotted DCups 10 bucks and later got that paid back but Tyke still ended up being in 30 when it was all said and done.  He was even up for a little while thanks heavily to Dr. Phil's dad but that ended up going down the crapper.  A tough hand with QQ and A10 and then right after A10 Tyke got AJ and ended up getting outdrawn by Dr. Phil to take him out.  Tyke was pretty mad when he was out.  He usually doesn't get mad losing money but this is the most he's ever lost and he didn't lose it in ways he liked.  It just put him in a bad mood.  Listening to DC on the way home couldn't even make it a sad mood.  Instead it remained a bad mood and then when he got home it went away when he told his parents about the game.  First thing his mom said, "230 dollars?!?!?!?!?"  Yes, mom but I lost 30.  Tyke told his dad about how DCups got both quad Js and a straight flush off the flop in 2 of his hands.  And there was another hand with quad 5s later.  Then some full houses too.  It was just a big night really.  Tyke really wanted to win some money but he didn't.  When he got home though he took a 20 that his parents owed him but Tyke just decided he would leave it until now.  So he only lost 10 tonight and DCups still owes him 10 too.  Tomorrow it looks like there might be a basketball game going on so Tyke will probably join that.  Other than that he has no plans so give him a call and set something up with him.  He'd love to join.

      Guess who's back and bleeding crimson?  Well Tyke's back but he isn't exactly bleeding crimson.  Alive! wasn't too bad actually.  Tyke went in expecting it to be very much of a hassle and something he really hated going to.  He had a pretty good counselor though, Martin, and he enjoyed some of the things he did.  Along with Tyke were a couple members of this blog, Frederique and Triple Threat.  Those three and two other Issy grads were all there at the same time so they hung out.  The first night was kinda sucky cuz Tyke didn't know where anyone was and his roommate wasn't much fun for Tyke so he just sat alone in the room reading the WSU Catalog and hoping he would get rid of a headache he had.  That was when he realized that he was very much going to miss his friends here.  One person came to mind on a few occasions that night.  He finally went to sleep and the heat wasn't too bad and his roommate wasn't a hassle either.  His roommate was actually one of 3 guys in his group that he didn't actually dislike.  Actually, maybe 4.  But none of them did he like persay.  Just wasn't opposed to.  One guy explained that he was homophobic and the other guy talked about "fairies" and how a gay guy came on to him, which Tyke heartily doubts, and other comments that immediately made Tyke think he was closed-minded and thus a bit of a douchebag.  Tyke has no problem with people until they show they have a problem.  Then Tyke can have a problem with them.  Well for the most part Tyke did not like any of the guys at WSU other than the ones he knew and the actual counselors there were nice guys.  The girls weren't bad.  There were quite a few pretty girls and Tyke knew there was nothing wrong with trying to talk to them and make a friend but as usual he got shot down there.  One girl in his group, who is actually from Sammamish and was born in Overlake Hospital and went to Europe this summer all the same as Tyke, Tyke put most of his focus on.  She was really pretty and had this something about her that Tyke really liked.  So Tyke rolled out all the stops for her and did everything he could to show her what kind of a guy Tyke was.  Well Tyke didn't have  Kinker ending to that one.  She never initiated any topics of conversation with Tyke, nor did she really respond to any of Tyke's talks with anything that showed she had any interest in talking to Tyke ever again.  It wasn't like she visibly hated Tyke but she just didn't care about him.  That was a little disheartening as Tyke was proud of himself for taking the initiative and really trying to talk to someone but she didn't care.  Basically Tyke didn't talk to any of his group mates.  All of them party, Tyke does not, and they weren't exactly in the same intellect as Tyke it seemed.  One guy Tyke thinks really worked hard to get to WSU and has gotten scholarships he desperately needs so Tyke really respects him because Tyke is not even close to that dedicated.  People like that make Tyke feel good.  Even if it means that it shows that Tyke is taking for granted his intelligence and abilities and really not applying himself yet.  But he will have to do that soon in order to get to where he wants in life.  On a funnier note Tyke saw Paris Hilton at Alive.  In fact, she was in his group.  Frederique and Trip T can attest to that fact.  This girl was so very much PH (prounounced phhhhhhh Tyke and Frederique decided).  She looked like her, tall and skinny with blonde hair and a strong tan.  She also talked just like her.  It was freaky at first.  She also acted like her in some ways.  She loooooves to party she says but also is a really nice girl.  She doesn't have a little dog though.  Tyke saw two other look-a-likes at WSU but not ones that blog readers would know by a blog name.  It was really funny to see Paris.  Tyke talked to her some and she also showed no interest in talking to him much but Tyke had given up on trying to make a friend by the time they really started to talk.  Tyke talked a lot with Freddy and Trip T though.  It's gonna be cool hanging out with them next year.  Tyke is already gonna be staying the night in Freddy's room sometime next year.  Probably with Kinker or Trip T.  So it's gonna be fun keeping in touch with the Indians.  Hopefully they do keep in touch and don't drift away.  Tyke really isn't too excited right now about meeting so many new people right now just because he really doesn't think that Tyke fits in with most of them.  He isn't against drinking and that stuff but he certainly doesn't drink now.  And really he has no interest in doing so.  So far Tyke has pretty much only met people who want to party.  Another reason that Tyke is not a big fan of most of the guys is just cuz they aren't as focused as Tyke right now.  This is weird but Tyke might be able to focus on studies for once in college.  Or at least at the start.  He will have a lot of friends going there probably but who knows.  It will all be figured out in 19 days when Tyke actually leaves for the East side of the state.  Not a time that Tyke is anxiously awaiting.  Not really at all.  Summer has been far too short.  It was fun getting Tyke's schedule though.  He has a very full Wednesday, 4 classes.  But his Monday has only 2 classes and Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday only have 3.  He also has 2 classes that should be easy for him.  Chem 101, cuz he has basically already taken that class in high school and he did well in it.  And Span 102, cuz Tyke thinks he has retained Spanish pretty well and this is also the equivalent of Spanish 2 while Tyke has taken 3 years so he should be ahead of most people.  So that makes his schedule easier on that busy Wednesday.  His earliest class is 10:10 and his last one starts at 3:10 and that is a chem lab which shouldn't be too bad.  Overall Tyke isn't too displeased with his schedule.  In fact it's pretty decent.  He couldn't get Com 101 because it was full but it turned out it wasn't full so he could right now get into that but in order to do that he's going to have to switch his schedule up.  That class starts at 9:10 too.  So it would be early.  It is the only class that directly applies to his major but the other ones he is taking because he needs them to graduate, let alone be certified.  So it will all work out.  He can still change his classes whenever he wants right now.  It is all online anyway.  Hmmm...what else?  Oh yeah, Tyke's dad tried to see if he could get Tyke switched into the dorm he put as his first choice especially cuz it's close to all the classes he is in, most notably the Communications building.  He had some relative success.  It is still less than a 50% chance Tyke will get in there but he can and after seeing Stephenson's dorms he wouldn't mind going to a different one.  The dorm room was quite small.  Quite.  And Tyke is one room away from having the corner room which is infinitely times bigger.  It's just huge.  Well other than that, the food wasn't all that bad Tyke thought and the walking wasn't a problem.  It's hilly but Tyke has some pretty good legs so he's cool with it.  He'll like getting the exercise anyway.  But he is thinking he might gain some weight in college.  Sure most students do, hence the Freshman 15, but Tyke actually will eat if he has food available to him most of the time so if he can eat he will.  He just gets full kinda quickly.  But enough of that.  Tyke is gonna play with his laptop more cuz he hasn't in days.  He now can play poker too.  Yee-haw!

      Today was a good day.&nbsp; Woke up about 11 and found it kind of odd that he woke up but it turned out it was because his mom called his name out because the doorbell rang and she answered it.&nbsp; Yeah, it was BCL's Baby, or Tyke's new laptop.&nbsp; BCL's Baby is its name.&nbsp; So Tyke played around with that for a while.&nbsp; Some software and a few cables are still coming in a little bit so he doesn't have everything yet.&nbsp; But everything works and the screen is big and pretty cool.&nbsp; So that will entertain Tyke for a while.&nbsp; During the day Tyke went out to pick up a Measles immunization form from the doctor and the girl who gave it to him is the RA of the floor below Tyke at WSU.&nbsp; That was a little weird.&nbsp; Tyke got a call from Bondage in the afternoon so he went over to his house and played poker with Bondage and Shane.&nbsp; Then Pinneo came over and later MSwa came over.&nbsp; Tyke was winning for most of the time but ended up losing 10.&nbsp; He got 3 straights and a flush in the first 4 hands he was dealt though.&nbsp; That was cool except he hardly got any money out of the hands.&nbsp; During the game Tyke called Purdy to see if she was going to the Inn at night but she wasn't so Tyke tagged along with Bondage and they went down and met up with some of the ladies at Sunset and then drove from there with Pinneo.&nbsp; They took a nice route and had some good times on the way.&nbsp; Then Bondage thought he knew which hall they were holding The Inn in but yeah, he was wrong.&nbsp; So they missed like a half hour of it cuz they were on the floor below The Inn.&nbsp; But they did sign some card for two people getting married.&nbsp; They just copied exactly what was written in the signature above.&nbsp; After the Inn they went to Bubble Tea for the first time ever.&nbsp; Tyke really does hate the bubbles.&nbsp; They're so annoying.&nbsp; So he got a cup and every time he got some balls in a sip he would spit them in the cup.&nbsp; Ingenious idea.&nbsp; After bubble tea they went to a place that some people might think Tyke wouldn't go to.&nbsp; But they went to a hookah bar.&nbsp; Tyke is still not 18 so he couldn't legally buy it but he did try it.&nbsp; He really didn't like it though.&nbsp; There was nothing that was good about it he thought.&nbsp; The best part was seeing smoke come out of his mouth.&nbsp; Other than that it didn't do anything for him.&nbsp; And it left a bad aftertaste.&nbsp; Everyone else liked it and they did it enough to get a buzz from it but Tyke only did it like 10 times max.&nbsp; They finally left at like 12:20 and then went to Sunset so Tyke could get his car and then he came home.&nbsp; So he did quite a few things today that were fun and one that was informational.&nbsp; He now knows he doesn't like hookah.&nbsp; He actually still sorta smells like it too and it isn't that great of a smell.&nbsp; But tomorrow Tyke is not looking forward to.&nbsp; Cuz he has to drive all the way out to Pullman and then stay there for 3 days for Alive!&nbsp; That is going to suck a lot.&nbsp; If he gets lucky he can make a friend but he thinks it might just be super sucky.&nbsp; And he'll be gone for 3 days which won't be fun.&nbsp; So it's just not a good combo.&nbsp; Oh, this would be the last blog then.&nbsp; Cuz he probably isn't going to be taking his laptop and blogging.&nbsp; He could...hmmm...he's gonna have to see about this.&nbsp; But don't expect a blog.&nbsp; Not until Friday.&nbsp; Then he'll have one for sure.&nbsp; Until then.

      Here's how today went.&nbsp; Short and sweet.&nbsp; Got up at 11 cuz he knew he was gonna get a call sometime mid-afternoonish time.&nbsp; So he got a call from Tina at 11:30 telling him to come up at noon so he got ready and left.&nbsp; Tyke just realized that this isn't going to be a short and sweet blog most likely.&nbsp; Tyke got to Tina's and waited for Purdy and then they went in and found Tina out back.&nbsp; So they talked a little and Tyke explained his Europe trip to Tina's mom.&nbsp; Tyke and her mom haven't ever talked that much but recently he has been talking to her and Tina's dad a lot more.&nbsp; She even asked Tyke about his Europe trip and he didn't even know she knew he went.&nbsp; Unexpected but delightful.&nbsp; Frederique came over a little later.&nbsp; Then the 4 of them went out on Tina's boat.&nbsp; They laid out in the sun for a while and then Haras came over so they went back and picked her up.&nbsp; Then her and Frederique did a little tubing before Frederique had to go back to the dock and leave.&nbsp; So then it was the 4 of them again and they went back out on the water and laid out more and then just drove around.&nbsp; It was fun and then sun was shining down but it wasn't all that hot so it was nice.&nbsp; After they docked the boat again they went up and laid on the deck for a long time.&nbsp; Then Purdy wanted to go to Redmond Town Center so they did.&nbsp; Nothing like doing girl shopping with 3 girls.&nbsp; Tyke is somehow pretty used to it, even though he doesn't do it that often.&nbsp; They saw Ms. Middleton at the Gap of course.&nbsp; She sure was excited to hear Tyke is going to WSU and also freaked out the gang a little with how planned she was for the year.&nbsp; She knew what games she was going to, where they were at, when they were.&nbsp; Damn, Tyke barely even knows what day he's moving in and she knows everything.&nbsp; They got some Starbucks and looked at stuff and then went back to Tina's.&nbsp; They waited til her brother's friends were gone and then they went out on the boat again.&nbsp; It was funny cuz Fejj was there but he was only there cuz he is rushing at a frat this fall so he was hanging out with some of the frat boys.&nbsp; He and Tyke chatted a little since they haven't really hung out much all this summer.&nbsp; After RTC, Ekul, Gin (Tina's bf), and C-biscuit came over.&nbsp; So they all went out on the boat and tubed some more.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; Tyke is super good at tubing so he can just sit in the tube and comfortably have his body tucked into the hole so it is almost impossible for him to fall.&nbsp; He and Ekul rocked out on the water.&nbsp; But Ekul did it a harder way and did better tricks than Tyke.&nbsp; Tyke just didn't fall out until the last time when his tube flipped sideways.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun though and Tyke hasn't gone tubing in years.&nbsp; He has only gone like 3 times in his life too.&nbsp; After tubing was all done they went back on the deck and then played ping pong and played the guitar and the guys hung out for a little while the girls changed and stuff.&nbsp; Then they came back and Kramm came over for a little while Tyke and Ekul were in the hot tub making up cool new names by changing the vowels in a name to a different vowel.&nbsp; For instance Chris could be changed to Chros (cross) and stuff like that.&nbsp; It is fun with some names.&nbsp; After the hot tub everyone made cookies and ate them.&nbsp; That was fun.&nbsp; Then they didn't really do much for a while and started a movie at about 10:50.&nbsp; Sneakers was the movie.&nbsp; Good movie but Tyke left before it was over.&nbsp; Just because everyone else left and being at someone's house when it is just them and their bf/gf is not fun nor is it always appreciated.&nbsp; So Tyke left, said goodbye to Haras as they left together and then came home.&nbsp; So yeah, if Tyke just said everything he did today it would sound like an awesome day but really it was just pretty good.&nbsp; He did get a little burned and it's a little uncomfortable now but really not that bad.&nbsp; And he has some weird bloody thing on his arms but the blood didn't break the surface nor did it ever hurt.&nbsp; So basically it's just weird looking.&nbsp; That's from tubing.&nbsp; But really it's just the day was sorta depressing.&nbsp; Cuz after this year Tyke really thinks his friends will be totally different and he will already have lost touch with some very close current friends.&nbsp; And for a while this year at least, Tyke will still have pain cuz he can't just forget.&nbsp; The surroundings will remind him and his friends will too.&nbsp; So it won't be easy to start over.&nbsp; But it has to get better than the current.&nbsp; This summer Tyke has either played poker, bowled, or been with the girls and their bf's.&nbsp; That is almost everything he has done.&nbsp; The latter is the most disappointing.&nbsp; Living on the outside looking in.

      Woke up this morning, got himself a towel.&nbsp; Mama always said he'd be the showered one.&nbsp; Weird how that came up.&nbsp; But this morning meant that Tyke's family all left.&nbsp; And it was actually a relief for Tyke's parents that everyone was leaving as well.&nbsp; Cuz it just was a hassle.&nbsp; Tyke and his dad also went to the Mariners game at 1 so they left right before everyone actually left.&nbsp; Good timing it turns out.&nbsp; The Mariners game was a good one too so that was an added bonus.&nbsp; The weather started out poor but it ended up being quite nice by like the 7th inning.&nbsp; The Mariners won pretty easily and there were some exciting plays so it was just a Winn-win situation.&nbsp; After the game Tyke came home and he and his parents talked about the family and how his mom isn't even going to try with the get-togethers anymore.&nbsp; She'll still see her family but she isn't going to make an effort to have everybody over again.&nbsp; It just doesn't work.&nbsp; She got quite annoyed by her mother many times in the 2 days and she even said, "If I get like that when I'm older, shoot me."&nbsp; Harsh words but they were warranted.&nbsp; So they talked about that for a little and Tyke mentioned how his parents are actually totally cool.&nbsp; Sure there is a bit of a generational gap between them and Tyke but it isn't that big.&nbsp; And they let Tyke do most anything he wants which is pretty cool so Tyke really has it nice.&nbsp; Later on in the evening Tyke had some pizza and did some massive cleaning up downstairs.&nbsp; Way worse than when Tyke has teenage friends over.&nbsp; Dog hair everywhere, sheets all over, towels out of place, it was a sty.&nbsp; But Tyke's cleanliness overtook his laziness and he fixed the place up a little bit.&nbsp; A few hours later, after more yummy cheesecake, Tyke had Dr. Phil and Kinker over.&nbsp; Tyke got a call from Naan later on and her, Dudely Doo, and Ybrad came over.&nbsp; They mostly played PS2 while the other 3 played cards.&nbsp; So there was sorta a split but most everyone was having fun and there was some interaction but it was a little weird come to think of it.&nbsp; Cuz they were all sitting right next to each other but hardly even talking to each other.&nbsp; Tyke won 5 bucks in 31 though.&nbsp; That was cool.&nbsp; Then later on Purdy called which was unexpected but always welcomed.&nbsp; They shared the usual pleasantries and conversed in some common chit-chat and then set up a preliminary meeting for tomorrow.&nbsp; After the phone call and 31 Tyke, Kinker, Dr. Phil, and Macaroon all played Risk.&nbsp; It was a friendly yet spirited affair this time.&nbsp; Lots of battles.&nbsp; Tyke looked pretty strong from the beginning but Dr. Phil made a timely dash and went through Tyke's strong defenses to take his capital and somehow hold it the next turn.&nbsp; It was a battle indeed.&nbsp; Dr. Phil looked strong but then he became weak and then he just took a POW of Macaroon's and that left Macaroon disheartened and out of the game.&nbsp; So basically Kinker ran through the rest of the world shortly thereafter.&nbsp; And now Tyke is just blogging but he does sorta have to be up early in the morning.&nbsp; Well, at least before 1 cuz that's when he's expecting a call.&nbsp; Other than that it's all cool.&nbsp; Ok then, ok.

      Today actually involved Tyke going out and being busy almost all day.  Maybe not busy-busy but he never just sat at home doing nothing.  Wow, blogging has not been fun for like a week now cuz Tyke has been talking to so many people online that he never has time to focus on this.  So Tyke got up at 12:30 this morning, set up a play date with Macaroon (changed that a little later on) and then helped his brother bring in his old mattress.  That took a while and he then had to eat before leaving for his haircut.  After that he went to Macaroon's house and picked him up cuz he had nothing to do cuz his play date went kaputz earlier on.  Dairy Queen was the next stop as Tyke got an impromptu lunch and then went to meet his mom at Fry's Electronics in Renton to look mainly at printers.  They got some good looks in and then Tyke got a laptop backpack (has a special place for the laptop in the backpack) and a cover for his laptop as well.  But the coolest buy was some video editing software Tyke has needed to get.  It will be pretty useful as Tyke mom wants him to convert old VHS and tapes to digital stuff so that they will actually get used.  So she jumped all over the product.  It was kinda funny actually.  Tyke didn't think they were going to actually buy it today but they did.  It was about 250 bucks and Tyke's mom thinks she'll be getting the  real  Photoshop soon too.  The $650 version.  Or it's 650 at Fry's at least.  After Fry's Tyke went into Bellevue with Macaroon to drop Tyke's car off for a servicing and picking up his brother's car.  So it was just a straight swap, but an upgrade in car and sound system.  Then they met Dr. Phil and Amed at Red Robin in Factoria and got dinner there.  After that they went up to Macaroon's house and hung out there.  They played Monopoly where Tyke's shitty streak of luck continued and he got 3 straight rolls where he landed on somebody's property that was already built on.  It was quite sucky.  They also played Mario Tennis and Gauntlet Legends though so that was cool.  Gauntlet Legends was fun for a while but then it was just all of a sudden super late it seemed and everyone split.  Then Tyke came home and tried out the stuff he got at Fry's.  And basically, even if it didn't sound busy, Tyke was pretty busy today.  Doing something from waking up until coming home at midnight.  Not a bad day overall.

      Nothing fun happened once again.  Tyke checked out cell phone plans for him and his family cuz they are too busy either trying to track down their lost luggage while on business in Ottawa (Dad) or they're helping out Tyke's bro with all of his moving stuff as he leaves on Saturday for D.C. (Mom).  That is basically what today was.  Tyke doing cell phones, Tyke's mom helping Tyke's brother.  Then later on Tyke went with his mom to meet Tyke's bro at Europa (the land of the Volvos) for his car's checkout before driving it 3000 miles across country.  That's gonna be an interesting trip.  40 hours of driving over 4 and a half days.  Tyke gets tired just driving to Pullman.  His brother will be driving past that and all the way to Bozeman, Montana just on the first day.  Well dinner was pretty good and then after that Tyke went back home, got ready quickly, and went back out to K-Caj's house on Mercer Island to hang out with Dr. Phil, Amed, and Macaroon.  They played Scrabble, Spider-Man, Halo, Risk, and Monopoly.  And the piano too.  But it was a keyboard so they made cool beats and Tyke is actually semi-decent at some songs on the piano.  It's just not easy to learn them without being able to read sheet music.  He has to do it all by memory usually.  He can't even do it by hearing the tune at the same time.  That just screws him up.  Tyke came home about 1 and he made pretty damn great time for coming all the way from M.I.  Not sure how long but maybe 15-20 minutes.  Average speed was supposedly 50.7 mph but it wasn't all that fast.  Yeah, he took the Avalon which is why he knew the average speed.  He didn't just make that up.  Well tomorrow involves Tyke getting his haircut which he's looking forward to cuz he hates long hair and he may not have actual long hair but it's long to him.  Short like torte.  That's what Tyke always says.

      The sucky Tyke life is continuing strong.  Nothing is really very much fun right now for some reason.  Today was just not fun.  Got up and did nothing but transfer the remainder of Tyke's music to his laptop and that was fun a little just cuz he was listening to really good music but that's about it.  It took a lot of effort, jogging up and down the stairs from computer to laptop, laptop to computer.  Wow, Tyke just realized a way that would have been way easier.  Taking the laptop up to the computer cuz he could.  Then he would have just had to take out the memory key and move that two feet.  Stupid Tyke.  Well after that Tyke's mom called and he told her his spider story from last night and she laughed heartily at it and then they planned to meet to get White Lightning's emissions tested.  So he took the Volv down and it couldn't finish the test cuz the tailpipe is fractured.  So now they have to get it fixed and take it back again.  Just more wasting of Tyke's oh so busy days.  After that Tyke had even less to do.  He watched tv and did almost as close to nothing as is possible.  Then he sorta got a poker game set up with MSwa at Bondage's house.  Later he called Macaroon and went over there before they went to Bondage's.  They played some ping-pong and Tyke won the best of 3 series of games to 11 but Macaroon won the game to 21.  Then they played Mario Tennis and left.  Tyke had absolutely no luck on his side this night once again.  He didn't win a single hand until his 3rd buy-in.  He never won a big pot and one time when he had trips and finally could bet well MSwa of course had a full house so he won it and took Tyke all in that hand.  Tyke lost another 40.  He is actually going to have to do a little cutting back on the poker playing now.  It's stupid.  He hates having to do that cuz he hasn't done anything else but poker for pretty much every night since like 2 weeks ago.  But 2 weeks from today Tyke's gone.  Out the door.  Headed off to Pullman.  Still will be a blog to read but fewer mentions of the usual guests.  Kinker of course will still be there but others won't.  You know who you are.  Oh yeah, Tyke hasn't hung out with a "real girl" for over a week now.  You could sorta say one week but The Inn wsan't much hanging out.  Some short chit-chat but nothing much past that.  So yeah, it's been pretty slow in that area.  But this time is being taken by Tyke to move on and forget the past.  Not fun.  But certainly not new.  Good luck avoiding that all.

      Tyke should probably just do this boring blog now.  It's not like he did anything.  He got up and transferred music to his laptop and talked with his bro when he came home for a little.  He also watered some plants and played with the laptop.  Then later on he really did nothing until he had his dinner (creamy caramel shake at JIB) and then went to Kinker's house for poker.  It was an absolutely terrible night.  And now it just got infinity times worse.  Tyke is so freaked out right now.  First of all he lost 50 bucks in poker.  But then here at home he was just blogging when out of NOWHERE a FATTY HUGE spider came crawling out of the vent underneath the desk with the dartboard in the downstairs.  So that made him flinch and then it came closer and Tyke saw it was even bigger than he thought.  This thing is a tarantula.  It probably weighs as much as Tyke does.  Which might not be that much actually but it's still a lot for a spider.  It walked a little bit and then just stopped.  Tyke got so freaked out he jumped up and moved everything that he was using away from it.  Then he went and had to get a picture of it but only had a videocamera near so he grabbed that and went to filming it.  He isn't sure if he got the true girth and hugeness of it but it was just very very big.  He was filming when he decided to inform the people he was talking to online of his troubles and then when he looked back to its spot he didn't see it and his heart stopped.  Then he looked forward and it was running right at him at probably 3 mph which is insane for a spider.  This thing must be on steroids it's so muscular.  It could easily stand on its hind legs and grab the handle on the door to let itself out but it must want to stay inside and feed on Tyke's living body.  But Tyke can't kill it cuz it's so big.  So he ran away from it again when it came at him and then filmed it some more.  This thing has probably eaten little babies.  Not even kidding this time but it most likely wouldn't fit in the hand of a baby, or maybe even Tyke's come to think of it.  If it was hairier than it would almost certainly be a tarantula.  Ok Tyke if itching so much right now.  His mind is playing tricks on him.  He needs something to calm him down.  He just needs to go to his safe room and ponder his next move from there.  He was going to go WWF on the thing and smack it with a chair to kill it but when he looked back at it, it was gone.  It is always one step ahead of Tyke.  How is that even possible?  All Tyke knows is that it has fangs the size of Rhode Island.  And legs like Baja California.  How can it even live?  It has to eat like 3 times as much as any other of its spider friends.  It probably got made fun of as a little spider for being so ogre-ish.  And now it has come after Tyke with a vengeance to get back at his little playmates and prove himself to the gang he is a part of now.  Last night it killed a hooker it met on the street and then dragged her body to the zoo to make a point to the animals there that they could be next but they would never know when.  And now Tyke is about to faint.  *Exhale.

      Today was a very very busy day.  So busy and fun-filled that Tyke's throat hurts from all the yelling and screaming and enjoyment.  It started out with Tyke going to get gas and return something at Blockbuster at the early call of 11 o'clock.  Quite early indeed.  After that Tyke had a couple of pancakes and played some casino on the laptop.  At 1:30 he went to Amed's court and played bball with Amed, Maniak, and Macaroon.  It was pretty fun and lasted for a good hour to hour and a half.  Not bad for 4 people.  Afterwards they went to 7-11 in Eastgate and DUI joined.  So they got their slurpees and then were sorta perusing the store when the cashier told them they had to come pay for their drinks.  Tyke thought that was a little weird but he went up and paid thinking nothing of it.  Then they all paid and were pretty much walking out when the asshole cashier thought Amed was skipping out without paying.  Amed clearly showed that he had paid and displayed the exact change he got back and everyone else had paid obviously as well, except for Macaroon but he made the valid statement that he had paid with exact change first off.  So then they were pissed at the cashier but they went outside and sat on Macaroon's car and kept on eating and talking when after less than a minute the goddammn fucking asshole cashier came out again and said they had to leave and he just stood there with his gay ass face and his motherfucking retarded head and made them leave.  So they drove over to McDonald's parking lot (right next door) and stood out there and finished eating.  What a dick that guy was.  Tyke even splurged and bought a Milky Way to go along with his slurpee before all the other asshole stuff happened.  He regretted that purchase (even though it tasted oh so yummy good).  The brilliant idea of playing Monopoly was introduced while they were eating and Tyke suggested his house so they all went over there and thus the best night in a while started.  Tyke hadn't played Monopoly in probably a couple of years, at least with a few other people.  It was just such a great game.  A mad bidding war started when DUI got hotels on Park Place and Boardwalk and that ended up making Tyke a very strong competitor with all 4 railroads as well as a monopoly on the light purple lots (St. Charles, etc.).  It continued and got down to Tyke and Maniak being the last two, both with all of the property available built on.  It was basically a rolling war.  And Tyke lost it for a while but managed to gain it back after selling some houses and mortgaging a few properties.  He kept rolling on and on and then got better rolls and stayed in the game.  But by this time they had been playing for almost 4 hours and everyone was whining and they wanted to get dinner so they suspended play when Maniak had about 8k plus assets while Tyke had about 2-3k plus assets.  However, Tyke was on the up again and looking pretty good.  But when outside and getting ready to leave Tyke and Maniak decided they would call it a draw and they shook hands and Tyke congratulated Maniak on a very well played game.  It was the best Monopoly game ever played most likely.  Words cannot describe it.  During the game Kinker called and they are back from state now so he came over.  Then Tyke, Kinker, Amed, and Macaroon all went to JIB for dinner and after that got a poker game going with those guys as well as Fejj, DCups, K-Caj, and Tyronious.  Another big crew.  $10 buy-ins of course.  It was a good day but Tyke had to buy in a second time.  So he was in 20 but ended up cashing out at 12:10 when the last 4 (Tyke, Kinker, Amed, Macaroon) decided to quit.  Tyke came out with a total of $45.  So he was up 25 from his buy in and also was owed 10 by DCups so he really came up 35 from today and thus added 5 to his bank when you subtract the 30 he lost yesterday.  It's actually a lot of confusing math so maybe he is still down from yesterday somehow but who knows.  So yeah, it was a great night.  After it was just Tyke, Kinker, and Macaroon Tyke played some Hoyle on the laptop and showed them how it was pretty cool.  He pretty much struggled getting anything though and lost in the Texas tourney and then did well on the other stuff.  Omaha not that well but decent at the end.  But that was just about everything Tyke did today.  With some graphic detail about the 7-11 guy.  Oh, and Tyke takes Spanish 102 on Tues-Fri at 10:10 in Thompson 209 if that helps anyone ;).
