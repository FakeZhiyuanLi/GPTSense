      woo hoo.. its my first blogger thingy bobber. haha i'm goofy right now. ok so i just got back from london yesterday.. i was gone for like a week. it was very fun and i would live there if i ever became rich and could live on one of the side streets and have my stewie, friends, and my computer of course. =) so i left on june 22 and we were flying the whole day basically. first we went to newark and flew from there to north carolina. the plane was reallly tiny and it was called AMERICAN EAGLE!!   ok anyway the day we got to london it was rainy and horrible .. the kids there are still in school until sometime in july. its basically year round school because they have 6 weeks off for summer and then during the regular school year they have 2 weeks off in certain months. wow i'm rambling an awful bunch. then once we got to the hotel the room wasn't ready for another 3 hours so me and my mom went to starbucks and it was freeeeeezing outside. if you ever go to london bring a sweatshirt because somedays are really cold and others are spring weatherish. now i didn't bring a sweatshirt so we went to this mall place and we were looking for something warm. we found this sweater but it was ugly so i didn't buy it and then we found these sweatshirts at this souvenir shop but i didn't want them. anyway we got back to the hotel eventually and slept and then went on this dinner/boat ride thing on the river themes. it was extremly expensive so don't do that when you go there because we saw the exact same things on the river like 2 other times for a quarter of the price..of course there was no dinner but who cares about that.   the next dayy we went on this guided bus tour thing. i don't like the bus tours as much as the walking tours because with the walking tours you see more. anyway i forget where we drove to it was early in the morning and we saw like the same stuff other days. I REMEMBER! we went to this church called st something and thats the church princess diana got married in. then we went to see the changing of the horse guards but they weren't doing it that day. we saw some other stuff but it was aslkjlk. then we went on this walking tour later that day on these side streets.i saw where that winston churchill guy lived and some other people's houses. then we saw this school and all the kids had their cute little accents and they were all riding on their scooters.. it was cute. then we went to this tea place but i had italian ice cream instead of tea because i don't care for tea. then we went shopping and i bought a purse for the summer. for dinner we went to bella italia for the first time..it wasn't too shabby. then at the hotel i watched the first quarter final of the euro cup. it was england against portugal..portugal won in a shoot out. (the euro cup is "football" soccer to us)  i'll finish the rest of my vacation tonight some time and you better read it because i'm cool. haha probablly going to get my groove 2001 on right now and do some ddr. cheerio!

      ok i'm temporarily skipping cape may because i can.. but i will write about it soon. i got back from cape may on the 25th of july and i went to my father's house. we were going to go to the peach festival oh what fun but that ended at 5 and he picked me up at 4 so i got lucky since i didn't really feel like going. i was really bored that night because i was used to having people to talk to around 24/7 so it was sad. anyway my dad told me my lap top has a virus or something and is practically out of space now so i'll probablly end up getting a new one!!   anyway the next day was captain's practice for soccer and i saw the lovely kasey p. there! then i went home got changed went to the orthodontist and i had to get x-rays done. so the lady who was doing the x-rays compared her height to mine and she was 5'5 and she was saying she was short and i was like no you're tall and then she said that like everyone she knows is taller then her so that of course made me feel better since i am 2 inches shorter then her.. o well i'm short stuff hahaa i forget what i did for the rest of the day   tuesday was really fun! christina theresa maria came over and we just did junk and watched the part on alladin where he says take your clothes off if you turn the volume up really high you can hear it and then we went online and kasey imed us and was like want to do something so we said yes and decided to go to the movies. we decided we were going to see mean girls even though it said open captioned (which we found out later means the words are on the bottom). so we picked up kasey and went to regal. then the ticket guy was like i wouldn't recommend seeing mean girls because its open captioned and it's all messed up because of the storm so then we decided to see shrek 2 which was in 45 minutes. my mom had already left so we bought popcorn and stuff and then went to the movie part and walked into the shrek 2 place and the movie was on so we decided to watch some of it. then after 5 minutes we walked out then walked around the place for a bit and then went in the white chicks theater and watched some of that and that looks like a very funny movie. then we went back to shrek 2 and watched the end of that movie and then we waited for everyone to get out and then we went back into the theater and sat down. christy left to go to the bathroom and we should ahve gone with her but of course me and kasey didn't so we were just chillen, hid christys popcorn, and ate some skittles. then this guy walks in and he said he just saw i robot but it was raining outside and he didn't want to go out there so he decided to watch another movie. then 2 other girls walk in and christy comes back. everyones talkin and crap and then the power goes out and the movie didn't start yet. the emergency lights were on though so it wasn't pitch black. me and kasey then decide we have to pee so we got up and it was all dark and scary and we went into the bathroom and the lights are off so we tell the people working there and they tell us to go in the other bathroom since there are emergency lights in there. now me and kasey know that if christy tells us we should go to the bathroom we should listen to her lol after that we run back into the theater and we run into someone who works there and she's like maybe you should try walking next time. anyway we find out that we can stay in the theater until the movie starts working again but they might have to kick us out if it takes too long or something. then christy took some pictures of me and kasey on her cell phone and looks at the pictures in her album and couldn't figure out who one girl was and kasey's like prob some person who stole your cell phone and took a picture of themself and then kasey was like wait isn't that you and christy looks at itt again and is like oh it is! hahaa then christy asks the guy why he's here because he lives like 500 miles away or something and he said he's going skydiving and everyone was like cooool!  just for the record when i'm 18 because i think that might be the age you have to be.. i'm going to go sky diving  anyway he said he had a video tape in his car of him skydiving so he goes out and gets it and shows us and its all cool. then the movie people end up kicking us out of the theater cuz the power still hadn't come back and they gave us a movie pass and christy's mother drove me and kasey home.. anyway me kasey and christy had very very fun even without seeing a movie haha and i love them! then later that night i went over catherine's and we watched figure it out on channel 133 and it was all fun and i wanted to get up at 7 the next morning and go over her house because legends of the hidden temple is only on from 7-8 am and that show was awesome but i never did end up waking up so yea. then we asked people if in the lisa it's your birthday song if they say we wish you praise and joy or we wish you peace and joy   then on wednesday i was in my pjs all day until captain's practice and then after that i went to catherine's so we could be smelly together and stayed there until 12 or so and we got really bored and we were putting all her make up stuff on haha fun stuff ofcourse then i had to leave and i left her the mess because my mother was waiting for meee..los siento  on thursday i was bored basically the whole entire day and it was horrible. it's really weird because most days in the summer i'm really busy or i'm somewhere on vacation and then there's some days where i'm stuck at home and i'm realllyyyy bored. i watched the dance recital video in the morning and it was funny to watch our jazz dance.. i can make music! you can? you bet i can! listen! hahaa i ended up going to blockbuster around 8 or so and i got this movie called sliding doors.. it's not a new movie and it takes place in london so that's why my mother wanted to get it since we were just there  on friday i got to go shopping for like the first time this whole summer and i was really happyyy! i went to old navy and got 2 shirts and then i went to american eagle and they were having a sale on stuff from summer so i bought 2 shorts 1 pair of capris and flip flops!!!!  then i went to aeropostale to exchange the shirt that carolyn got me for a smaller size but it wasn't thereee! :'( and it's sad because carolyn had that shirt too and it said something about hawaii on it and yea bummer so i ended up gettinglike cash back for it but i will use it to buy something from that store eventually. i got to watch forensic files last night too and that was exciting since i haven't seen that show that much this summer. and i also watched full house! i love that show!  now here i am on this loverly saturday morning. my legs no longer hurt from captains practice so that's goooood i have no idea why they hurt so much before but i think it's because we sprinted and i haven't done that this summer. i'm leaving for delanco tomorrow and i can't waitttttttt! write to me if you love meee alex(is) holmdal c/o delanco camp 171 sooy place road tabernacle, nj 08088 i'm hoping my relient k shirt will be delivered soooon! oh and i get to see sarah sarah horneff on tuesday because my mother is bringing her to camp to visit! fun stuff. um.. i got a new email for anyone who cares to know it's spiffyclean4u@comcast.net that's about it.. think i'll update on cape may today because i sort of want to do it before a week at camp! see you later alligater! oh yea.. just so you know.. if you want to look at all my entries for july you have to click on the july under archives!

      on friday, the day vbs was done with, my father and marie picked me up and we drove to new york city. on the way there we got stuck in this bad traffic jam for more than an hour so i like sort of fell asleep in the back seat and listened to my relient k cd and i was content hah. we got to the hotel around 12 and met up with tara and her parents. then me, my dad, and tara's dad went to the bread factory which was 2 blocks away and i got some dinner at 1 in the morning haha. my dad saw a sign for like a mini supermarket thing that said open 25 hours.. it was funny. ok when we got back to the hotel we went to bed so yea (christy loves when i say that.. she told me that yesterdayyy) the next morning i got up and tara called like an hour later and we decided to go to the pool. i was pooped from vbs because i didn't sleep much that week so i fell asleep on the pool deck but i did go swimming for like 5 minutes but i thought it was too cold. when i was sleeping i found out my dad mooned everybody .. wow then everyone took showers and stuff and we went out to dinner at some place. the food was pretty good and i didn't have to pay for anything so it's all good. then we went to see Chicago! and paige davis is in it and she got us the tickets because my dad knows her dad and it's cooool. we sat like in the center of the fifth row and it was fun stuff i really liked it. then after the play was over we got hers and the other lead's autograph and we took pictures with them..i'll try to put them in here if i remember but the pictures are at my dad's. then we went back to the hotel and i went to bed.. the next morning me my dad tara and her dad all road the subway to umm that place that's famous and there's a beach and boardwalk..ahh i forget what it's calleedddd! oh well it's in some movies like uptown girls so maybe you can figure out it's name. i think it's coney island but i'm not positive. anyway me and tara went on the roller coaster called the cyclone and it was really rough and i didn't like it because of that and i'm a baby so :-P then we saw this freak show that was reallyyyy stupid and worthless and disgusting. this lady ate crickets and i hate those things with a passion because they jump and you never know where they are going to go! then we basically went back to the subway because it was raining outside and then we drove home.. i stayed at my dad's that night and then he dropped me off at captain's practice for soccer and then i went to cape may which i will update on shortly because it was fun stuff but the post will be super de doopery long just to warn youuuuuu!

      dude this week was very very fun! but the only thing is i forget when everything happened because i just spent a week in cape may and yea   well i guess i'll start off with me and emma's lovely song! on our way to mini golfing i said something about the emergency door on the bus and emmas like we should make a song and we did! it's really cool and we might be able to get it on cd when matt gets back from his trip so here is the lyrics and you probablly won't understand any of it because most of it is inside jokes and stuff  Emergency Door   by: the gibdal's haha (actually me and emma but we can't use our last names haha)  paint chipping french fries on the floor that's why we need you emergency door and i don't mean to complain but the bus drivers insane chorus emergency door what else could we use you for without you we'd be depressed  cuz we think you're the best  ba da ba ba ba i'm lovin it  remember the time we drove through buttsdown i'm surprised the sidewalks weren't brown and the time we took the PV detour we needed you then emergency door  chorus  ba da ba ba ba still lovin it  do you want to buy a cow  or how about some chocolate milk i've got some on my shirt right now and instead of the cow i'll "gopher" an elk  oh bus we love you so much with your carpenter lights and such and when we look to the back we see the  chorus  emergency door  put the pedal to the floor make all the passengers stressed and we'll put you to the test  ba da ba ba ba can't stop lovin it  and that's it! soon we're going to make a song about a puffy skunk hahaa me and emma also watched pocahontas during our spare time and they all have funny noses on that movie and it's like an animated soap opera.. oh and the big thing that happened is i finally realized that julia (emma's little sister who i absolutely love because she's so cute) is possessed after you spend more than an hour with her.  ok during the day for vbs i helped out because it was kids aged from preschool to fourth grade. originally i was going to be a crew leader but no kids showed up in my group the first day and the second day i took over billy's group because he didn't show up and then for the rest of the week i helped out with the preschool/kindergarten songs where emma and kyle were working. that was really fun because we had a lot of breaks so we listened to relient k and worked on the emergency door song and ate cookies.   then after the morning was done the jr/sr high people got to go places. we went bowling and i never got over 100, mini golfing and we messed around but it was fun, ice skating and i used this little thing thats like a walker on the ice because i can't ice skate for my life and me emma and some other people i forget who it was all shared one but by the end of the day i could skate around decently sort of, and this lake place which i didn't go to but ended up taking a nap at home.   during this vbs (vacation bible school) week, people from asbury college came to our church and were speakers for the jr/sr high during our vbs time. 2 of the people from asbury (mary and sarah) stayed at my house and mary likes relient k so me emma and her sang outloud to the songs and it was fun.. oh yea! i also tried raman that week .. shrimp flavored.. it was alright kinda weird stuff.  umm anyway during the night service for us i really enjoyed it.. first off they sung for the moments i feel faint which is a relient k song! then everyone played these corny games and one was called sponk which is like who's line and that was extremly funny.. and i was wondering why's my name frodo..and it sounded like techno so i started to dance and dance haha then people from asbury would give a little testimony thing each night or talked about a story from the bible and stuff.. it reminded me of delanco in a way. then after that we went into small groups and in my group we played this game called flowerpot which is fun because flowerpot can be like anything and a person has to guess what flowerpot means by asking people clues . i'm flowerpotting right now! hah and yea then we talked about stuff and it was all good. yea overall it was a fun week..kristen was chaddar this year and i was chaddar last year (chaddar's a chipmunk).    i've got this thing for nancy drew her hair is blonde her eyes are blue yea i think i'm falling in love!

      dude i haven't updated in this thing since forever ago so i have ooodles of stuff to share with youuuu! ok so i went to wildwood like 2 weekends ago with the lovely carolyn! i got to her house around 8 or 9 am on friday. then we stayed at her house for an hour maybe to wait for the cleaning lady to come.. her names angelica and she only speaks spanish. anyway we found out that she was sick or something and that she wouldn't be able to clean that day so we left for wildwoooooooooood! on the way there me and carolyn waved to people from our car. we must have waved to 100 people and only 11 waved back to us! out of that 11 one girl smiled so we counted that as 1/2 a wave and one guy stuck his hand out the window and waved to us so that counted as 1 1/2! we also heard this ones for the girls who have ever had a broken heart. who have wished upon a shooting star. you are beautiful the way you are.. this ones for the girls. yea its a song and we heard it in the car and carolyn couldn't get it out of her head so she kept singing it all day. then we got to the house and unpacked, made the beds, and discovered tuna fish in the fridge that had been there for like awhile. by 12 or so we were on the beachhh! it was quite a funny beach day. we went in the ocean for a little bit but it was kinda chilly so we basically just layed down and talked and stuff. carolyn put some sunscreen on my back but only did the middle part so i got this weird tan line thanks to her but now it has kinda evened out. we saw these girls who had to have been cheerleaders flirting with the lifeguards forever and they were only talking to one of the lifequard guys and not the other one so i felt bad for him anyway we went to get some iced tea to drink and when we came out we discovered that a seagull pooped on carolyn's mom haha then we saw these 2 boys who must have been from europe in speedos! omg i felt bad for them because on one speedo it said speedo on the butt! anyway they must have been embarrased because after they took off their shorts they kept pulling down their shirts to cover the speedo and i was just like why don't you just take your shirt off put on your shorts and go in the water but i guess they never thought of that.. hmm we also saw this lady who made her swimsuit into like a thong and she looked reallllllly bad. hhahaa oh yea the whole time on the beach i was like i want crabs for dinner and then carolyn would be like i think alex wants crabs tonight and her mom would say no reallyy. fun stuff anyway i did get crabs for dinner from rick's seafood and they actually delivered food my dad and marie had forgotton to pick up there to our house so that was nice of them. we watched the fireworks from the window cuz we had a good view and then we went to hassels and me and carolyn shared a waffle sandwich she got chocolate ice cream and i got chocolate peanut butter. the next day carolyn and i ran to the end of the boardwalk and back but we took a break in the convention center because they had a delias warehouse thing adn everything was $5 but we didn't have any money with us so we couldn't buy anything. then we went to the beach but carolyn and i only stayed for like 2 hours since it was extremly hot and we were on the beach all day yesterday and we wanted to do some other stuff. anyway we walked back to the house took showers then my dad came and we all went to get pizza..the waitress was from some place i guessed she was from spanish or something haha hMm then we went back to the house and sat on the porch and threw around the wildwood ball!! oh yea we played soccer too and everyone was like loooking at us but it was all good. anyway we were on the porch throwin the wildwood ball which is this little rubber ball thing we got at like cvs last year and it bounces really goood and is cool. i think carolyn through it off the porch or something and this guy tried to throw it back up to us but it hit the roof instead and bounced back into the street and almost went inside this car and the people in the car are like oooo look! the guys wife is yellin at him and asking him what he's doing because she's at the corner while her husband is running around in the street. meanwhile carolyn ran inside because she didn't want to laugh in his face so i had to stay out there and wait for him to find the ball and throw it back to me which he did do. we dropped it another time and this elderly lady was carrying bags across the street and it looked like she was going to pick it up for us but she like dropped her bags and we started to laugh so then she just walked away hah one night i forget when but we blew bubbles and that was really fun. i didn't have the technique though lol and i discovered that you can catch the bubbles with the little wand thing and the blow on the bubble and then you can get more bubblessss! we went out to dinner that night because carolyn's dad came down and i had crabs again!! my dad told us the story of how he dislocated his knee or w/e dancing haha thats a manly story alright! we went to hassle's again and i got a ice cream cone and carolyn shared a waffle with her father.. me and carolyn want to work in wildwood when we are 16 because it'd be awesome! anyway we went back to the house and sat on the porch and then carolyn's father used carolyn's head to sleep on and her neck had a cramp or w/e haha. on our last day me and carolyn went running again in the morning and brought money with us to stop at that delias thing however it was no longer there and instead it was these dancers doing thier dainty cartwheels and we were all like hot and sweaty from running and i said we definetly didn't fit in. umm we got back to the house watched some tv and saw the part in the newlyweds when they ask the waiter if he'd ever date a girl from hooters and he's like i wouldn't because i'm gay haha carolyn and i chilled on the porch for a bit and ate some cheesepuff things and listened to the radio and i sang outloud to the parts in songs that i new and this ones for the girls came on so we started singing that and it was cooooool. then we wanted to go on some rides so her mother took us there and we went on the log flume once but there weren't any cool guys working and it was only girls and they were mean and not fun to talk to so then we went on the roller coaster like 6 times and sat in the front seat. we sang on that ride cuz we're coool like that and carolyn yelled out smile when they took your picture. a guy waved to us when he was walking on the beach and some other people did who were in line for the water park. oh yea there were this one boy there and when he sat in the seat the worker lady asked him if he'd like the thing that goes over you so you don't fall out to be tighter and he said sure i guess but she pushed down to hard hahaa and he was like uhhhhh. then i tried to put on my seatbelt and i couldn't get the buckel thing to like go in and the boys like you put the metal part in the buckel and i'm like i know that so carolyn ended up helping me put on my seat belt haha.. then we had to leave sadly and we got dippin dots and i dropped some of them because i saw ddr in one of the arcades. oh yea i saw this kid who had a shirt on with a squirrel on it and it said protect your nuts.. i thought it was funny. and that's basically my anual wildwood vacation with carolynnnn! and this year i didn't get as burnt so thats cool and i did buy a pink flip flop necklace at this craft fair there.. i love it.

      hello my dear friends! nothing spectacular happened over these past two days..isn't that a sin! well yesterday i didn't do like anything at all and i was being lazy. i talked to allison for a bit and learned that we both had to take showers haha and i did take a shower just so you know.. infact i just took another one like 2o minutes ago! ok then i talked to carolyn!! we're going to run this weekend in wildwoooood. i played ddr for an hour or more i'm not really sure but i got like almost every thing on light mode to a b or higher and i got 2 aa's!! haha oh yea i forgot to tell you why my title is hi i'd like to order! ok so my phone rang yesterday and i picked it up and said hello and the woman on the other side said hi i'd like to order and then i said i think you have the wrong number.. are you trying to call the chinese place and she said yes and some other stuff i forget and then she hung up. my number is like really close to this chinese place anywayyyy then we went to my dance place because my mother had to pay something and we ended up talking to miss kathy about london because she went there in 2002 i think. then i went to blockbuster and rented ferris bueller's day off and win a date with tad hamilton. i watched fb's day off last night and it was quite a funny movie. my favorite part is when he sings twist and shout and my second favorite part is when a telegram card thing is delivered to his house and this lady dressed up as a nurse is saying her poem and ferris's sister slams the door in the nurse's face right before she says f... and i laughed. hmm then i went to bed i think. now today i went to my last dermatoligist appointment thing so that's good and then my mother and i went to home depot to look for paint samples for my bathroom which will match that picture i told you about that i got from london. then we went to shoprite to turn in these prescription things and then we went home and i watched win a date with tad hamilton and it was cute i think and then i packed for wildwoooooood! then cathy came over and we played ddr and i'm better than her nowww! hahaa!! and i got a c in max 3oo! woohooooo anyway i have to go now my father's hereee! wildwood this weekend! love those wildwood days wild wild wildwood days!

      so i'm writing in this thing twice in one day but this time it will be shorter i promise! after all not even 24 hours has passedd  i went to the doctors place today to get my check up and physical thing done.. i am 5'2 3/4"  so that rounds to 5foot 3 inches and if i'm lucky i will grow about 1/2 an inch!!!! aksdjfkl;asjdf i weigh exactly inbetween 105 and 110 so if your smart you can figure that out and there's like 75% of people my height and stuffwho weigh more than me so that's gooooood.. but i've always been like that. i don't know why i'm telling you this but i did so deal with it..anyway after getting all that done we were out of that place in record time like in less than 1 hour and then my mother and i went to panara bread. we split a sandwich and we both got chips and i got lemonadeeee! there was this lady there and after she finished her meal she said yummy delicious! haha then we went to some stores in the promenade and i bought a tank top and a shirt at guess. i was going to buy this outfit but the pants were too longggg! bummer then we went to target and i bought these flip flops that are blue and have chicks on them and say chicks rule. now if any of you people ever want to buy me a gift because you love me you can either buy me some fun flip flops either patterned or solid color (but i'm a little picky) and i am around size 7 or 8. orrr you could buy me a gift certificate to american eagleee! haha  after that we went to enchanted image which is where i get my hair cut. i finally got my eyebrows waxedddd!! i'm so happyyyyy =) haha and then i got my hair cut. then i came home watched some tv played some ddr then ran around the block once in 2:40 and then took a 3o second break or so and then started to run around it once more and walked a little bit when i got about half way and then 3/4 of the way i started to run again. CAROLYN you desparetly have to help me train for soccer like really bad and if you do and i make the team i'll love you forever and ummm i'll be in your wedding when you get married!  (well i'll still do that even if i don't make the team but i'm trying to bribe you haha) anyway it's already 9:40 and i have yet to eat dinner! shocking! this day went by pretty quicklyyy now i'm going to watch the rest of forensic files! guess what! i'm going to wildwood with carolyn this weekend! nothing gets hotter then that! haha adios

      bonjour! i realized that all my posts have been really long so far because i write many many words (that many many words was going to be a lot but then i remember english class so yea) and i combine many days into one post! well this post isn't going to be any different than the rest..  ok so like i said we had to tour around the tourists in philly. we took them to the liberty bell, independence hall, the constitution center, and we went on one of those duck tours. ok now that duck tour was one crazy thing and i have never been on it before. they give you these duck beaks and when you blow into it it honks sorta. so that duck thing tours you around and then goes into the delaware river and when we got into the river i was tired so i took a little nap haha. umm after that we went down to south street. my mom and i went to johnny rockets for a shake and everyone else went to jim's steaks. ok now if you have never been to johnny rockets pitty on you because they have awesome shakes and they give you the rest of your shake that doesn't fit in your cup so its kind of like a refil cup. i got a strawberry banana one and my mom got an orange creamsicle. anyway they have this little jukebox at your table and they give you a nickel to play song you want. i started looking through the songs and guess what i saw! TURN TURN TURN by the BYRDS! so then i told my mom all about mrs. lean on graduation day and stuff and i played that song and i have no idea why she chosed that song to write in her speech. then after our shakes we took the children to starbuck's because that's where they wanted to go and then we walked back to the car to go back home for a little bit. at home i watched a little fairly odd parents haha and then took a semi nap in my room except kara knocked on my door twice..once to ask where one of my cats was and the other time to like wake me up i think. then i posted a post in my blog and left to go back to philly to go on the lights of liberty tour which i've done like 2 or 3 times before. anyway when we were like just starting the tour a duck tour thing drove by so i got out my handy dandy duck beak! and blew into it and then the guy driving the duck waved at me and i waved back haha so that was alright. then after the tour we went back home again and i listened to my tenth avenue north cd in the car.  the next day was the 4th of july! i went to church in the morning and i accompanied my mother on the piano while she sang this song. i got compliments :) then i talked with emma for a bit! i love herrrrr and julia of course! in sunday school we had to think of this word that began with a c and kristen had like just said a c word 2 minutes earlier and i remembered it so i yelled out compassion and i was right matt gave me a high five and kristen was liek that's my worddd. umm my mom told me ricky dyed his hair black asjdflasjd i'll have to speak to him. ok back home i went to the neighbors for a bit. cathy isn't comfortable with her body haha i had some cherry tomatoes. the pleasantly plump kid was there (who rides around the block on his motorized scooter even though he should be riding a bike) and his family..i saw the mom get some dessert and she saidd the next day she was going on the south beach diet.. i bet she was lying. anyway they ate a lot and that's all i'm going to say about them. i went in the pool for a bit and cut myself on the wall and my hand still hurts :( and it bubbles a lot if you put hydrogen peroxide on it. then i tried to get music in here (i will have music shortly!!!) and then me and cathy jogged to my house and played some ddr. GUESS WHO BEAT MAX 300!!! I DID WITH A D! YEA haha hMm then we went back to the neighbors well jogged their and watched the fireworks which were funny because they were lighting them right between two trees and these cars kept coming and cathys dad was like hit the car and the windows were open and then james (the neighbor)lit one and it like went to the right and then came back to him so he like jumped in the air when he was still on the ground it was funny. then after that me and cathy went to her house and watched the twp fireworks on her driveway and then we got up and my butt hurt then i watched some of this movie but i didn't really like it.. its from the 1987 or somethin and then i called my mom to pick me up got ready for bed and fell asleep around 11..weird.   ok yesterdayy.. the visitors left our house in the morning we got some krispie kreme donuts! umm me and cathy ran around the block twice well i ran around twice with a 2 minute break in between each lap haha but the second lap i ran around in 2:56 and i wasn't too tired so that's good. oo i watched some of ferris bueller's day off or w/e his name is..it's funny. i played sims for a bit and then cleaned my bathroom haha cuz it was dirty with all those people over and 5 people together including me using it and then i started cleaning my closet haha well just like the winter stuff or some of it. I NEED NEW FLIP FLOPS LIKE DESPERATELY! I DON'T HAVE THAT MANY ANYMOREEEEEEEEEEEE :( then at night i watched forensic files and my dad called and told me that in the gloucestor county times or w/e they had the people from bunker hill who got straight a's all three years but they only put in the second group who was announced and i was in the first group so i got no credit at all so i'm going to write to them because i want to be noticed! haha my mom yelled at me for some stuff and then i got ready for bed read some good earth (i have a little more than 2oo pages left!) and fell asleep around 11 again and woke up at 9. i had some weird dreams i think.  todayy i have a doctors appointment at 12:30 for a physical thing for soccer. then i think i'm going to get my eyebrows waxed!!! YES! haha dance people- remember that time during modern and we started talking about people's eyebrows and jackie never likes hers and they ask if she wants them to fix them and she says no because they hurt and jackie likes brielle's eyebrows. haha ok umm i might buy some flip flops today but i don't know  GREECE WON THE EURO CUP! 1-0 and i didn't get to watch it!asas;kj  wildwood is this weekend...hottness! and then vbs and then the beach for a week i think i forget but yea i love summer vacation!

      hola! i don't know where to start.. well i'll start with yesterday because that was fun. better yet i'll start with the night before. ok so these people came out from st.louis and my mom grew up with the madre (joanne) so that's how we know them. so it was joanne, john (her husband), and their 2 kids...boy alex haha and kara. alex is going into 5th and kara is going into 3rd. they came like in the evening and earlier in the day i was cleaning and stuff. actually i did go outside for a bit and tried to do that trick thing in soccer that carolyn taught me..(keyword try)haha she needs to teach me it again in wildwoooood! =) anyway we played some ddr well they took lessons but only finished lesson 1 and almost all of lesson 2. then we went outside except i didn't really go outside. i stayed inside but the screen door was just there so yea. there were a lot of bugs outside and there was this beetle thing on the chair outside and it was green and ewww and there were all these other bugs flying around. anyway people were like touching that beetle thing cuz it wasn't moving and i was like freaking out because who in the world touches bugs. eventually it flew away and hit the screen and i screamed. then i went outside because they were telling me i should and i was outside for a little bit until i looked down and saw a bug on my boob and then i screamed again and ran inside and sat on my chair that was like right near the door. then people kept going in and outside and bugs kept flying in so i would like push the door close when they were halfway inside so they would hurry up. it was icky. ok the next day was really fun! we took them to wildwood because the children had never been to an ocean before (they've been to lake michigan which is like the beach with waves and stuff). on the way there we saw a woman in a convertible smoking a cigar..alskjdflaskj. i did have a very fun time at wildwoooood. we were seated to the right side of the great noreaster and when i usually go we're on the left side of it but i was okay. i laid down on my towel for a little bit and got a little tan but i'm going in a week with carolyn! anyway i put sunscreen on this time unlike i did last year. it really hurt last year and the whole back side of my body was bright red and my legs peeled a whole bunch and it was disgusting and i learned my lesson that you should wear sunscreen even if it feels cold because being less tan is better than being burnt and in pain. also you get less wrinkles!! haha i did get a little burnt on the lower back of my body because no sunscreen was applied there... oopsyyy daisy. then i went in the ocean and did some boogie boardinggg which is fun stuff. i also saw an elder gentleman there in a speeedo. it was scary! after that we went on the boardwalk and went on some rides. i went on the great noreaster with my mom and she was like shocked afterward because she said it was faster then she thought. i went on the logflume with alex and kara and i said hello to the guy underneath but he didn't seem to happy :-/ then because i'm such a nice girl i went on the tea cups with kara because we had 4 tickets left and that was the only ride worth 2 tickets. after that we went to hassel's for some yummy icecream.. i got a warm waffle and vanilla and fudge icecream. we did try to go to rick's seafood to get some dinner there but the pick up time was like at 8 so we went somewhere else. ok then we got home and i took a shower and went to bed. oh i forgot! we watched freaky friday on the way their and monsters inc on the way back.. pretty nifty. ok i'll finish the rest of this later because we're going to see lights of liberty! funnn...i already did that twice! but you have to tour around tourists! haha ok adios  i forgot to add that in london my mom scared me half to death because she had just fallen asleep and i was still awake and she started talking! then she asked me if i really wanted those knives there. i was quite scared and woke her up and then she told me shhhhhhhhh hah  EURO CUP UPDATEEE! i found out that portugal and greece are going into the finals and that game is tomorrow and i won't be able to watch it on tv because they like don't show the euro cup in the us and that sucks haha

      ok now onn friday we did this walking tour from 10-4 with this tour guide.. his name was tom. he is/was this london judge guy who wore the funny wigs anyway my feet hurt by the end of the day but it was just my heels. we saw buckingham palace which is where the queen resides i believe. then we saw the changing of the guards!!! i loved that it was so like funny. i have a picture of me and my mom and one of those guard guys.. maybe i'll put it on here. (sorry christy.. i didn't tell them you thought they were cute because they didn't really pay attention to you and there were all these people and yea asl;djf haha) anyway so they were changing shifts and one of the guards who was going in for the next shift had his hat fall down over his eyes. it was funny because it must have tickled his nose so he kept like sniffeling and he wiggled his chin!! but he did get it fixed somehow..  they aren't allowed to touch their hats and if they need it to be adjusted they have to push a button for someone to come. ok i forgot to tell you that on our way there my mom and i got briefly separated from our tour group and started walking with this japanese people and then when we got back to our group tom was like didn't you realize that none of us look japanese. ok so after the changing of the guards we went to the banquet hall that was and still can be used for dances and the ceilings are pretty and a guy got his head chopped off there. there was a sign over the entry door that told you about that guy but i forget what it said. we also went to a pub for lunch sometime in between. i had some pringles and a sandwich thing. ok back on the door to finish up our day we went to westminster abbey which is this gigantuan church. they have a boys choir too and there are people burried in there like the unnamed soldier and people who have memorials sorta like shakespear. there's only one guy in there who is buried standing up and they know that because queen elizabeth or someone wanted to have a record of everyone burried so they had to open up the graves and when they opened the grave of that one guy or w/e they did.. his head rolled off. uMm.. after that my mom and i went in the methodist church across the street and the guy there took us on the balcony and it was neat. we went to pizza hut for dinner haha i had j2o for my drink.. orange and passion fruit flavored if i recal. i liked it. and by the end of the day 2 people asked my mom for directions and she helped them surprisingly even though we hadn't been there for too long. i'm horrible with giving dirrections. oh i watched another euro cup game at the hotel france vs. this other team.. france lost.  the next day we did this shakespeare walking tour and it was raining. we road on the river themes again (i spelled themes wrong in the last post) and heard everything we heard the first night all over again. i don't really remember what we saw on that tour except we saw this building that was around during shakespeare's time. then we went to the tate modern museum. I got this picture there that has different pictures on it of lucy from i love lucy, a glass of orange juice, like a breakfast plate thing, minnie mouse, and a can of tuna fish. i like it haha the day before when we took the tube which is an underground subway i took a picture of a capri sun but there they spelled it capri sonne it's awesome haha. ok so we walked around the museum for a little bit and then we walked across the millenium bridge (aka the wobbly bobbly bridge because when they first built it it didn't have enough support so when the people walked on it, the bridge moved). then we went on the jack the ripper walking tour. it was about this guy (they never found out the real person but that person is dead by now) who killed 4 women i think and he cut them apart and stuff.. pretty icky. after that we went to mark and spencers and bought some snack food to eat because it was decently cheap there considering that if something is 4 pounds we're paying like 8 dollars for it beccause the exchange rate is really bad. then at the hotel we watched the tourch relay for the olympics on tv and saw the planes fly over our hotel carrying the tourch from london to greece. then we watched holland and sweden play in the euro cup. i of course was voting for sweden and they lost in a shoot out i think.. all the teams i wanted to win lost.  then i got ready for bed and watched this glastonbury concert thing and paul mccartney sang some beatles songs.  the next ay we went on the magical mystical beatles tour! we saw where they made their records, abbey road, and the roof top where they last performed all together. there was this guy in the tour and he reminded me of someone from tv i think but i still don't know who he reminds me of..oh well. then we bought some souveniers in this abbey rd. newstand store. i got a picture of them holding umbrellas. after that we went to the tower of london which is this big castle thing i think that henry guy who had the wives lived there and his wives were killed there tooo! we also saw the crown jewels and they are like really expensive and old and are locked up in this hugee safe that you can walk into. then we took the tube to wimbledon and it was pouring rain like realy pouring. i bought some dorritos and when i went to pay the guy i handed him the dorritos instead of the money and he was like are these for me and i was like oh no! yea they were yummy and we bought a wimbledon hat. then we went back to queensway which is a street near our hotel and had dinner again at bella italia. i got a different meal this time. then wbe went back to the hotel and guess what we watched on tv! THE EURO CUP! haha denmark vs checzslovakia and i wanted checz. to win because it's a cool name and they wonnnn! ok one of these days i forget what day so i'll add it here.. i almost lost my favoritist earrings.. the ones with the stars on them. i was putting them on and one fell into the sink and landed on top of the drain thing which happened to have holes in it which it could have fallen into. so i carefully picked it up and it didn't fall and i was very happy. i would have been depresed if it fell down the drain. hah   ok the last full dayyyy. we went to the british museum tour woo hoo... but tom was our leader guy so it wasn't that bad. i still don't care for museums they make me tired. anyway we saw the rosetta stone and a part of one of the 7 wonders of the world and this dead guy named ginger who is preserved really well.. he's freaky looking. then we went to Harrods which is a huge department store thing. we got lunch from the food court and bought some truffles :) i love them. haha they were having a big sale and to get into the gucci purse section you had to go outside and get a ticket! that's like weird but that's what people did. after that we went on the london eye and that's this huge ferris wheel thing and like 15 people are in each thing that carries you up and the walls are clear so you can look at the views. that night we didn't watch the euro cup because the quarter finals are done with.. infact the semi finals start tonight so i'm going to see if i can see them over here some how. i did watch a soap opera though haha  now it tis the day when we fly back home to nj. the way to the airport we drove in this van thing that picked us up at our hotel and there were like 6 other people in it. the conversation covered a lot of topics. . let's see we talked about MICHAEL JACKSON alsdkjflk, religion, the schools here,  and some other stuff. then at the airport we waited in this long line. i got some hot chocolate and they didn't have those cardboard things to keep your hands from burning so i used a napkin :-/  the lemonade there is sparkling.. it's like fake lemonade i don't like it.. the bubbles hurt my tounge which is why i don't like soda. ok then we fly back home on those coooooool airplanes! i watched 50 first dates and some nick jr. haha gala gala islanddd gala gala! no i didn't watch that i watched Hey Arnold!, the end of a blues clues episode with joe i don't like him as much as steve, then this blue's house thing but it was a little skit thing and blue was the puppet and she sang the silly seat song haha, and then i watched the wild thornberrys and that family is really ugly looking i mean the dad has a huge nose and her mom has a skinny waist and big legs and they snore, and debbie is just jakslj, and eliza has a weird shaped head with pig tails and glasses and braces on two of her teeth. haha we got lunch and dinner on that flight and for dinner it was pizza! it was alright pizza..but they gave me these cookie things that i like which are simliar to the ones i take from the northwest club room thing. they are like these ginger cookies sorta but not really.. i like them alot. ok and i listened to my relient k cd about 564650450 times but it's an awesome cd so yea.  then after that plane ride which was longer then the flight to get to london so it was really long we had to get in line for customs and to get your passport stamped back in for your arrival in the united states and then we went to where we thought we were supposed to be waiting for our plane. however that place was the place we flew out of to get to london. oh i did buy some chocolate and drinks at that north carolina airport. i was choosing between krackel and a crunch bar so then i read the descriptions and one is like crispy rice in milk chocolate and the other is milk chocolate and crispy rice so i decided to go with the crunch because i haven't had that in a long time. anyway so my mom called her parents so they knew we had gotten to london and back to the us safely. then there was this lady sitting near us and she over heard my mom so when i started talking to my papa the lady told my mom that she couldn't help to overhear her conversation and she said that everyone here was going to london so we should double check our gate.. turns out the people on the AMERICAN EAGLE plain (the small one) had already boarded basically so we ran outside to get on the plane and we made it. i listened to my tenth avenue north cd and it was a short flight like an hour long. ok back at the air port in newark we were waiting for our luggage and we got my mom's suitcase but not mine!! and my suitcase had my favorite american eagle jeans in thereee! so my mom told them about my suitcase and they delivered it to us yesterday so now i have my jeans back in my closet   spiffy clean 4u! lol (if i forgot to write anything i'll add it later alligatorr but i think i got everything.. i wrote a lot)
