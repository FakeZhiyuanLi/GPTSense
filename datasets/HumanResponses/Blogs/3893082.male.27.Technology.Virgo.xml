      I wasn't able to post last night because my internet connection was not up and running until this morning.  Damn ISP, interupting my web surfing like that!  Of course, they were trying to blame it on my hardware not theirs.  Other than that, another day gone and a new one starting...  I can't wait for this work week to be over because I am going on vacation next weekend.  That means after Tuesday, I have 5 days off! Woohoo!  I'll be heading over to Louisville, Ky for family day at Ft. Knox.  Should be fun.  The whole trip cost me around $450 for round trip tickets, A 3 day hotel stay, and a car rental.  Not bad if you ask me.  I got all this through  urlLink www.hotwire.com .  They were the cheapest I could find out of the multitude of websites that offer their services.

      I don't know what's up today but I am in a very ornrey mood. Probably has to do with the fact that I got fooled by an email scam that should have been a very obvious scam had I stopped and thought about it! Well, I stopped and thought about it but with the wrong head!    Aside from that, I feel like causing a lot of trouble today and am thinking that I am going to take my frustrations out on the exercise equipment down at gold's gym! At least then I will be doing something productive!     Oh well, live and learn right...    Blog at ya'll later....

       Just a quick something I wrote while trying to go to sleep last night.  Thought you might like a little look in to my thought processes! :-)         Who am I?             I am the one who controls my destiny.      I am the one who controls my fate.      I am the one who loves so many      of the people that I hate.             I am the one who cries.      I am the one who laughs.      I am the one who try's      to make sure that time doesn't last.             I am the one who lives.      I am the one who dies.      I am the one who gives      while all of the others just pry.             I am the one who breaks.      I am the one who bends.      I am the one who waits      while all the others give in.             I am the one who writes.      I am the one who reads.      I and the one who fights      and kicks and screams and bleeds.             I am the one who leaves.      I am the one who stays.      I am the one who believes      that all of the world is fading away.                                     Tom Sapp    Blog at ya'll later...

      It seems that, sometime earlier today, something snapped and I am now officially crazy.  It must have been during work.  You see, I work for a large corporation, 14k+ people, as a Helpdesk Technician.  That means that their are 14k+ people that rely on me and my co-workers to keep their computers working for them.    Today, our computer systems and network decided that they would all go on vacation and this left everyone wondering why it is they can't view their email or find their files or who is this weird email from or blah blah blah blah blah.  This wouldn't have been an issue if we had more than 6 people to support everyone!    Unfortunately, we have to escalate our system outages, notify management of the outages, answer email's about the outages, document the outages in our helpdesk software, and continue to take calls and help people with their every day tasks that they are having problems with.    Honestly, none of this bothers me.  I am a work-a-holic and if I am not busy I tend to fall asleep! :-) That and I really do enjoy helping people with their problems.  What pushed me over the edge today was all of the questions I had to answer for my co-workers because they weren't sure what to do for most of their calls.      Again, this is usually not a problem, but for some reason today, everyone was very impatient today.  If I didn't answer their question within 5 seconds they asked it again, and again, and again...  Of course, I would finally answer them but only after I finished the call I was on.  This, of course, tended to piss them all off and make them even more whiny.    Oh well, guess we can't all be perfect! HA!  I'm definitely no were near being close to perfect.  If there is even such a thing!      Blog at ya'll later...

      I apologize for not posting, like anyones reading!, for a couple of days but I have been lazy lately. Friday I sat on my arse and played on my computer without eating anything until supper, dumb ass! Saturday, work really sucked as it was boring as hell. Nothing new there.     I did however decide to go out "clubbing" last night though. Went to the Buzz in scottsdale and drank too much and stayed out too late. Now I am at work on three hours sleep and still a little tipsy from the alcohol. Woohoo! :-) Kinda of getting bored of the club scene though. Lots of nice scenery but most of it is a little to high maintenance or too young to be worth maintaining. Atleast in my opinion that is.     I also read something today that kind of got me in to a depressed, sit-in-a-corner, leave-me-alone, type mood that I usually get in to when I start thinking about life in general. It's the Hacker's Manifesto by The Mentor. Any fan of the movie Hackers can tell you that it is a thought provoking and controversial document, but the part read in the movie is not the entire thing.     The document provides an inside look at the toughts of a teenager that most people would think is too smart for his own good. You know who I am talking about, the stereotypical hacker kid. Sits alone in front of a computer for hours on end, preferring to stare at typed text instead of communicating verbally. Tends to be an introvert and doesn't socialize at all with friends, and rarely with family, if they are not online in some sort of fashion.     What interests me though is not the document itself or WHO it represents, but the point that it makes. Everyone tends to judge people automatically by the rules that society as a whole has enforced upon us. How do they look? How much do they own? Are they wealthy or poor? What color is their skin? Are they male or female? and so on and so on.     Society as a whole needs to wake up and realize that, with computers starting to play a more significant role in the day to day life for everyone, people are going to become numbers and names. Your appearance and social status will no longer be as important as who you are and what information you share.     People will become faceless and names will become meaningless. The person you are dealing with may represent themselves as a 6'2" Blonde Haired, Blue-Eyed beauty but in reality they could be a 4'5" Bald, Blind, 600 pound individual that has to type with a stick because their fingers are to large for the keyboard! Sure, providing pictures and a means to verify who you are speaking with is a possible way to eliminate this, but in the digital world, reality is not what it seems. Pictures can be faked and identities can be spoofed. All it takes is time.    Unlike the real world, the digital world can be shaped and formed in to whatever the person with the knowledge and time to do so wants it to become. Where I exist in this digital world can be as close to someone else as the width of a hair or as far away as the breadth of the universe.    My brains hurting and I've lost interest in this post so I will stop boring you all with my philosophical babble.    Blog at ya'll later...

      I've recently started playing a game that I haven't played in a long while.  It's called  urlLink Uplink .  I pulled that game out of my archives to play it again because I haven't been able to find anything else to keep my interest.  When looking around on the forums for Uplink, I found a link to a similar game.   urlLink Wirelords  is a browser based game that is similar to Uplink, but is multi-player and is a little easier to play than Uplink is.  There is no real plot to the game but it is still addictive. :-)  Other than that, I have been enjoying my days off and am starting to get a little bored of computers all together.  I really need to get out and meet some more people!  I guess I am just too lazy! ha  Then again, going out requires money, which, as I am sure we are all aware, is pretty scarce now a days.  Kinda sucks getting paid a less than average salary for doing Helpdesk/Desktop Technician work.  If it were easier to find a new job in the IT field I wouldn't be complaining, but after 300 resumes and no calls I am a little worried that I'm stuck where I am at!  Oh well, life goes on... :-)  Blog at ya'll later...

      Well, I didn't do an end of the day update yesterday because I left work early to see my Dr. to determine if I have the West Nile Virus.  I had to do some blood tests and hopefully will find out today or tomorrow.  Bad part is, if I have it there is nothing that can be done.  I'm just hoping it doesn't worsen beyond the aches and pains, swollen glands, and rash that I have now.  If you want more info on this virus just go to the  urlLink CDC West Nile Virus Homepage .  Other than that, my week has been long and boring!  Atleast it is my Friday today!  YEAH!  Looking forward to resting over the next three days and hoping things get better.  I'm also supposed to be going on a couple of dates with a couple of beautiful young ladies but we will see how those turn out. Wish me luck! Woohoo!  Blog at ya'll later...

      Well, here's to the start of another wonderful day at work! (note the sarcasm)  At least I have people to keep me company today and it's the second to last day of my work week so I really can't complain all that much. :-)  I'm thinking of posting multiple times a day just to keep this thing updated, but we'll see how things turn out.  My days are not usually all that interesting so I may have nothing to talk about.  Blog at ya'll later...

      Well, been a while since I posted.  I've been a little busy with work and all.  Recently had to have my car fixed because some idiot decided to pull in to the side of me.  Luckily, their insurance paid everything, including a rental car!  I got to drive around a 2004 Dodge Ram 4x4!  It was nice, made me miss my truck.  I am glad to be driving my Intrepid once again though.  As for other things, I've recently taken a step back and taken the time to observe life as it passes by and things are looking great.  Work still sucks and I barely have money to live on but other than that I have been in a good mood lately and so far nothing bad has happened in awhile.  It's also nice to be able to enjoy the beauty that is nature in the wonderful state of Arizona.  We've been getting rain lately and it's been great.  I just love seeing storm clouds during a sunset, nothing more relaxing than that.  Except maybe spending it with a beautiful young lady who thinks the same thing! :-)  Oh well, Blog at ya'll later...

      Well, I am back from my trip to Ft. Knox to see my friend who is in the Army.  Unfortunately, I couldn't go to Ft. Knox because my friend went and got himself brokeded.  He is saying that tomorrow, 8/3, he is to find out what is wrong with his knee and when they are sending him home.  He is hoping they send him home on a med 40 in about 3 months, but says they most likely will send him home on a med 200 in a month.  Of course, I did learn two things from this vacation. First, I am never going to complain about the weather here in Arizona again!  OMFG! The humidity in Louisville was killing me!  Second, I am never traveling American Airlines again.  Not only was my flight delayed by 2 hours because of a computer failure but my luggage arrived 4 hours after I did.  Oh well, guess we live and learn and if you learn something new everyday then it is a good day.  Blog at ya'll later...
